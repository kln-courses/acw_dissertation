The Origin of an Eighteenth Century Fiction Sometimes it happens that the service rendered by philosophy is entirely obscured by the astonishing success of a scheme of abstractions in expressing the dominant interests of an epoch.1 There is perhaps no other epoch of human history which was so captivated by the abstractions of actio in distans2 as was the eighteenth century. This concept was accepted as an article of faith3 in various fields of inquiry, despite prior controversy over the concept,4 and in the light of the rare but consistent 1 Alfred Ν. Whitehead, Science and the Modem World (New York: Macmillan, 1925), p. 83. 2 Although standard histories of eighteenth-century thought refer to the concept, they usually limit discussion to the law of gravity and make only a tangential comment on its value for eighteenth-century collective thought. See, for example, Abraham Wolf's A History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century (Gloucester, Mass.: Peter Smith, 1968, 1st ed., 1938), Vol. I, pp. 375-83, Vol. 2, p. 676; Preserved Smith's A History of Modem Culture (New York: Holt and Company, 1934), Vol.11, pp. 31—43, 123 ff.; and Peter Gay's The Enlightenment: An Interpretation (New York: Knopf, 1969), Vol. II, pp. 180-87. A greater measure of importance is ascribed to the concept in the histories written at the turn of the century such as Samuel Miller's A Brief Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century (New York: Burt Franklin, 1970, 1st ed., 1803), Vol. I, pp. 13-111, Vol. II, pp. 1-35; and Daniel Jenisch'S Cultur-Charakter des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts (Berlin: Preufiische Akademie, 1800-1801), Vol, 3, p. 495 ff. 3 It is a topos of intellectual histories that thinkers in every age accept certain notions as true and given. As Carl Becker wrote, „In a very real sense it may be said of the eighteenth century that it was an age of faith as well as of reason, and of the thirteenth century that it was an age of reason as well as of faith," The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers (New Haven: University Press, 1932), p. 8. For a review of Becker's notion of the „climate of opinion" in the eighteenth century see Raymond O. Rockwood's (ed.) Carl Becker's Heavenly City Revisited (Ithaca: University Press, 1958). In his Materialien zur Geschichte derFarbenlehre (Weimar: Bôhlau (Leopoldina-Ausgabe), 1957, 1st ed., 1810), Goethe recognized that ^schools of thought" conditioned many of the basic concepts of eighteenth-century science. 4 A brief but informative review of the problem of action at a distance prior to the eighteenth century may be found in Patrick Suppes· „Descartes and the problem of action at a distance," Journal of the History of Ideas, 1954, 15: 146-52. More recently the static dimensions of distance were discussed in John T. Ogden's „From spatial to aesthetic distance in the eighteenth century," Journal of the History of Ideas, 1974, 35: 63-78. For a study of some of the differences between 69</page><page sequence="2">criticism by eighteenth Century thinkers. It is significant in appreciating eighteenth-century thought that we understand the development of concepts such as actio in distans, and also the pari passu development of the idea of fictions, which serve to appraise such concepts.5 This, it seems, is both a useful and fair approach for a Statement about eighteenth-century collective thought,6 for not all individuals accepted actio in distans as a reality. Some clearly perceived it as a convenient device for explaining many events. It is the point of this study to look at the transformations of this concept and at the ways it was used to organize and further eighteenth-century knowledge. A brief discussion of the idea of a fiction will be followed by a look at the usefulness of the concept of actio in distans in the diverse writings of chemistry, psychology, physiology, and anthropology. As is true of many useful fictions, actio in distans displays an ideational drift from the language of celestial mechanics to metaphors in other fields. Although historically suspect for its overtones of anthropomorphism,7 the concept gained scientific value in the eighteenth Century. Nevertheless, whether anthropomorphic or scientific, the action at a distance and later field théories see Mary Hesse s Forces and Fields : The Concept of Action at a Distance in the History of Physics (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1970), pp. 157-88. Most historiés of atomism make reference to the concept of action at a distance, although they are less concerned with the various forms of the concept than with its significance for théories of matter. Still a standard is Joshua C. Gregory'S A Short Flistory of Atomism·. From Democritus to Bohr (London: Black, 1931), while more recent interprétations include Trevor H. LeverE'S Affinity and Matter: Elements of Chemical Philosophy 1800-1865 (London: Claredon, 1971), Robert SchofielD'S Mechanism and Materialism: British Natural Philosophy in the Age of Reason (Princeton: University Press, 1970), and Arnold Thackray s Atoms and Powers: An Essay on Newtonian Matter Theory and the Developments of Chemistry (Cambridge, Mass.: University Press, 1970). An excellent survey of the dynamics of polarized concepts such as systole/diastole or attraction/repulsion may be found in Ewald A. Boucke'S Goethes Weltanschauung auf historischer Grundlage·. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der dynamischen Denkrichtung und Gegensatzlehre (Stuttgart: Frommanns Verlag, 1907). 5 Scholarship accepts more readily the critical than the non-discriminant aspects of eighteenth century thought such as those suggested by Carl Becker (see note 3). Peter Gay, for example, devotes an entire chapter to „The Climate of Criticism" in the eighteenth Century (see note 2), pp. 127-203, although there is no corresponding discussion of the presuppositions and articles of faith in eighteenth-century science. 6 A very useful source on the methodology for investigating collective thought may be found in James E. Curtis and John W. Petras' (eds.) The Soaology of Knowledge : A Reader (New York: Praeger, 1970). More recently Thomas Kuhn has studied the problem as a „paradigm" in The Structure of Scientific Révolutions (2nd ed., Chicago: University Press, 1970, Ist ed., 1962). For a criticism of Kuhn'S notion of a „paradigm" see Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave's (eds.) Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge (Cambridge, England: University Press, 1970). 7 For a brief review of the history of the concept actio in distans see Mary Hesse'S „Action at a Distance and Field Theory" in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Paul Edwards (New York: Macmillan, 1967), Vol. 1, pp. 9-15.

It remained a fiction primarily because of the apparent self-contradictory nature of the concept, for how can something act where it is not? The use of actio in distans in scientific discourse8 operated as a fiction, for such concepts never fully capture the reality of events which are directly observed, much less describe hypothetical médiums and non-material forces. It is the goal of this study to trace a scheme of abstractions through the eighteenth Century which were often predicated on the truth of a particular concept whose tangible existence has never been and perhaps never will be verified. The Idea of a Fiction. It is unique that we can turn to the writings of a single individual in the eighteenth Century for both a criticism of the concept actio in distans and for a séminal statement on its function as a fiction. In 1789 Jeremy Bentham wrote: It is to distinguish it from the attraction of gravity, of which presently, that the attraction, termed the attraction of cohésion, has acquired that name. Of this species of attraction, repulsion, it has been seen, is the constant companion and antagonist; each of the opposite and mutually balancing effects have equal need of a fictitious cause. Repulsion is the generic name applicable to other cases. Attraction of cohésion is a specific one.9 With this statement Bentham offered posterity an insight into the develop ment of the concept actio in distans, which appeared as a special problem in his général theory of fictions. Others before him, the English school of nominalists in particular, and specifically William of Ockham had fully understood the fictional nature of général ideas and had acknowledged the practical value of ficta in scientific discourse. Elsewhere in the history of science the question of the reality of théories and concepts had been the focal point of heatea controversy, as in the publication of Copernicus' De revolutionihus in 1543, 8 Many aspects to the language of science, including „private languages," „modes of speaking," and „language and Cognition," are discussed in Thomas Olshewsky's (ed.) Problems in the Philosophy of Language (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1969), pp. 732-44. Much of the discussion focuses on the logical relations of linguistic forms and offers only minimal attention to questions on the development of concepts, kinds of concepts, or formation of concepts. A useful example for this aspect of the language of science may be found in Carl Hempel s treatment of „Ideal Type" concepts in his „Typological Methods in the Social Sciences" in Maurice Natanson's (ed.) Philosophy of the Social Sciences (New York: Random House, 1963), pp. 210-30. 9 Jeremy Bentham, The Theory of Fictions, ed. C. K. Ogden (Paterson, New Jersey: Littlefield, 1959, Ist ed., 1789), p. 110. 71</page><page sequence="4">which contained an anonymous préfacé, known to be Osîander'S, declaring that the text was not to be taken for reality but as a hypothesis.10 From our historical perspective we observe in eighteenth-century thought many hypothèses, bogeys, perturbations, and false Starts; thus it is not surprising that Immanuel Kant,11 six years prior to Bentham, also anticipated the rôle of fictions in scientific methodology. Füll récognition of Kants contribution to the idea of fictions was documented in 1911 in Hans Vaihinger'S Die Philosophie des Als ob,xl but the significance of Bentham'S work remained unknown until several years later, when the first English translation of Vaihinger appeared. Today the idea of a fiction serves a variety of fields as a critical tool for the évaluation of historical and scientific concepts.13 It is quite natural, after two centuries of increasing scientific activity, that writers in the late eighteenth Century would attempt to draw distinctions between key methodological concepts such as fiction and hypothesis. However, despite the séminal thoughts on these concepts in Kant and Bentham the distinctions were neither clear nor fashionable and only became so through the course of the nineteenth Century. In the philosophy and history of science there are many eminent thinkers who have expressed the idea that hypothèses are only part of a scientific process in which reality is assumed, but whose truth needs to be tested and verified, or in the case of Karl Popper,14 falsified. Although there were precursors to the idea of a fiction like Johann Herbart15 (1850), and contemporaries like Henry Poincaré (1913) who held similar notions,16 we 10 A brief note on the background of the controversial préfacé may be found in Edward RoseN'S »The Ramus-Rheticus Correspondence, Journal of the History of Ideas, 1940, 1: 363-68. 11 Already a large part of the introduction to Kants Kritik der reinen Vernunft (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1904, Ist ed., 1781), Vol. 3, p. 32 references his view that ad hoc Systems and bogeys (Beschönungen) are a common fate of human intellectual activity and hence, one can be wary of even the most industrious and aesthetic édifices created in the name of science. 12 The füll title of Hans Vaihingens work reads Die Philosophie des Als Ob: System der theoretischen, praktischen und religiösen Fiktionen der Menschheit auf Grund eines idealistischen Positivismus (Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard, 1911). Citations will be from the 1968 reprint of the first English translation of 1924 by C. K. Ogden (London: Routledge Kegan). 13 See Frank Kermode'S The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction (London: Oxford University Press, 1966), pp. 35-66, for a recent application of the idea of a fiction, in this case in the field of literary criticism. 14 Karl Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery (New York: Harper, 1968), pp. 40-43. 15 Johann Herbart, Einleitung in der Philosophie, 2 vols.

Although Poincaré's language is not the same as Vaihingens, his discussion of several kinds of hypothèses, in particular the „second" or „neutral" kind of hypothèses, suggests the idea that a fiction is usefull methodologically. 72</page><page sequence="5">find in Vaihinger the first far-reaching understanding of the idea of a fiction, as well as a classification and discussion of the différent kinds of devices men have used to organize and structure their natural and cultural environment. One of the key distinctions advanced by Vaihinger is the methodological différence between fictions and hypothèses. While fictions, according to Vaihinger, must be subjected to the laborious task of vérification, they serve more often as auxiliary constructs which are discarded after serving a methodological function. Archétypes such as Goethe'S ideal leaf or intermaxillary bone served as useful fictions for the classification of plant and animal forms and processes.17 However, the value of archétypes later gave way to théories of évolution which more closely approximated facts and experience.18 In fact as Max Weber points out,19 ideal types are nowhere found in reality but as a fiction serve only a methodological function. Fictions are an expédient and a service to science, but scientific hypothèses on the other hand assume a high probability of truth and it is expected that eventually their conceptual constructions will agree with reality. Vaihinger defines a fiction as a collective term for labels of arbitrary déviations from reality: such as „inventions" or „suppositions." Concerning fictions Vaihinger writes: A whole sériés of well-known concepts, such as ,soul\ ,force', the various ,psychical faculties,' etc. belong here. Although these conceptual con structs were formerly, and are still today, regarded as expressions for real and existing entities, they are, in truth, nothing but summational expressions for a sériés of interconnected phenomena and interconnected processes. An instructive example of this type is .attraction.' Newton expressly says that he is far from assuming that such a force exists as something apart from the phenomena; he regards the term merely as a summational and abbreviated method of expression for the sum of ail the relevant phenomena and events subject to natural laws.20 17 For these and other concepts from Goethe's science see Rudolf Magnus's classic study of Goethe as a Sàentist, trans. Heinz Norden (New York: Schuman, 1949, German ed., 1906)pp. 44 ff. and 81 ff. 18 For a brief comment on the value of the transcendental morphology for the development of the theory of évolution see Loren Eiseley's Darwin's Century: Evolution and the M en who discovered it (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1961), pp. 117 ff. " Max Weber, Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Wissenschaftslehre (Tübingen: Mohr, 1968, Ist ed., 1904), p. 191. 20 Hans Vaihinger (see Note 12), p. 212. 73</page><page sequence="6">Newton considered the force of attraction or actio in distans, to be a fiction, and Bentham listed the force of gravity to be only one of several kinds of attraction, generic to the concept of repulsion. After Newton the term attraction came into more common and specialized usage than the term actio in distans and in scientific discourse it was rarely employed without its companion, repulsion. In the course of the eighteenth Century the concept of action in distans became further complicated with the conditions necessary for both „attraction" and „repulsion." However, in treating the origins of actio in distans as a fiction we are not asking about the ultimate truth of continuous versus discrète action, or about the existence of sensible distance, voids, and plénums. Nor are we asking about the criteria necessary for action at a distance in gravity, radiation, electricity, and magnetism, as was common in the field théories of nineteenth century scientists like Michael Faraday and James Maxwell. Instead, the fundamental concern here is a discussion of the concept as a fiction and the extent to which it served a useful function in eighteenth-century thought.21 As we have observed above, fictions perform a useful function in scientific discourse as long as it is not forgotten that they exist in the language of science and not in the language of nature. That is, fictions such as actio in distans serve as auxiliary words for explaining or relating events but are not accepted as isomorphic with an event. While actio in distans was employed as a fiction in the eighteenth Century, we shall see from the various uses of the concept that there was often a lack of attention to this caveat of conscious falsehood, which occasionally led the scientist to extend his system of rules beyond its practical and useful limits. The views toward actio in distans were varied, although for purposes of this study two groups are identifiable in the eighteenth Century. There were those like Gottfried Leibniz and Christiaan Huygens who held a theory of attraction or gravitation but rejected the existence of such a force in a void. While Leibniz held that ail created substance was continuous, Huygens accepted a modified vortex theory which also admitted attraction, although only through a continuum. This point of view continued through the nineteenth Century in the writings of Faraday and Maxwell where Leibnizian monads and Cartesian vortices were replaced by an hypothetical ether as a medium for the force of attraction. However, there were others like Newton and Kant who simply accepted and described action at a distance without fully committing 21 As Mary Hesse has pointed out in her study of the history of the concept (see note 7) „the point of the issue became not so much a metaphysical one concerning the nature of matter and of the medium, but rather a methodological one concerning the propriety of introducing theoretical constructs of any kind over and above the observed motions." p. 13. 74</page><page sequence="7">themselves22 to any point of view regarding ultimate matter, plénums, and voids. Kant, for example, doubted the existence of a void and preferred the continuity of matter; yet for purposes of explanation he employed action at a distance as fundamental to the Newtonian dynamics of the origin and stability of the universe. It is this second view which comes closest to Vaihinger'S idea of a fiction, or to Poincaré's „second" or „neutral" hypothesis. This view accepts a concept which may be self-contradictory, but which is useful for purposes of cataloging, organizing, describing, and explaining events; or, as Poincaré's states it, such concepts serve „to aid our understanding by concrète images, to fix our ideas as the saying goes."23 Any deeper analysis of the question of voids and plénums, as found in the Leibniz-Clarke debates, only entails problems of infinite regress, for neither can be verified with facts and experience. In fact, as George Berkeley observed (1721), the attractive force between planets cannot be observed as a physical quality, for it is only a mathematical hypothesis; as an entity it has „no stable essence" and dépends on „the notion of the definer."24 The Ideational Drift. Without going into the origins of the law of gravity we might observe with Bentham that the concept of actio in distans had, through the course of the eighteenth Century, drifted from an invented concept of mathematical physics to an assumed law of nature, expressed in various ways. By the last quarter of the eighteenth Century its applications were so many that Bentham found it necessary to draw a taxonomy of cases, distinguishing its various applications from that of gravity. We might further illustrate this drift by employing a modem fiction: ontogeny récapitulâtes phylogeny.25 That is, the writings from Newton'S own lifetime show a drift similar to the one spanning the entire eighteenth Century. In 22 It is difficult to pin Newton to a füll commitment to one or the other basic issue in théories of cosmology. Often such commitment is based on the debates of his disciple Samuel Clarke with Leibnitz as is done in Mary Hessels study (see note 4). In the présent study it is argued that Newton employed as a fiction the concept of actio in distans because it was convenient for his theory rather than because it was required by his conception of truth or reality. 23 Henri Poincaré (see note 16), p. 135. 2&lt; George Berkeley, De Motu, ed. Α. A. Luce (London: Nelson and Sons, 1951, Ist ed., 1721), Vol. IV, p. 50. 25 This fiction has been of importance to théories of language learning and historical linguistics, although it has greatest currency in the biological sciences where we find the notion that the human embryo, for example, during its nine month gestation period passes through stages of development similar to those in the évolution of Man. For a historical and contemporary Statement on the notion see Philip Appleman's (ed.) Darwin: A Norton Critical Edition (New York: Norton, 1970), pp. 205, 378. Today's comparative embryologist would perhaps restate the fiction saying that „Community in embryonic structure reveals Community in descent." 75</page><page sequence="8">Newton'S Principia26 (1686) the concept was expressed as a formal Statement, but later in query thirty-one of his Opticks27 (1717) the concept is accepted as true with only minimal réservations. In fact, here the concept cornes closer to representing a principle of divine origin than a conscious invention of Isaac Newton. At any rate, Newton'S query thirty-one came to represent an article of faith for people of its time, especially for those in search of a stable universe: Have not the small Particles of Bodies certain Powers, Virtues, or Forces, by which they act at a distance, not only upon the Rays of Light for reflecting, refracting, and inflecting them, but also upon one another for producing a great Part of the Phenomena of Nature? For it's well known, that Bodies act one upon another by the Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity; and these Instances shew the Tenor and Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that there may be more attractive Powers than these.28 Such imaginary Statement are common to Newton'S Opticks and it was precisely the conjectural character of such passages that generated the wide application of actio in distans. The younger Newton considered the conceptual aid a mathematicus conceptus,29 although in his later writings such disclaimers are rare. If Newton harbored any doubts regarding the reality of the concept, they were largely ignored in the eighteenth-century. We see how completely actio in distans was accepted as a realistic compréhension of the universe when we read titles such as Gowin KNIGHT'S: An attempt to demonstrate, That all the phenomena in nature may be explained by two simple active principles, attraction and repulsion: Wherein the attraction of cohésion, gravity and magnetism are shewn to be one and the same; And the Phenomena of the latter are more particularly explained.30 As Knight proclaims, who can determine 26 NEWton, Philosophie naturalis Principia Mathematica, trans. Andrew Motte (Berkeley, California: University Press, 1947, Ist ed., 1686). 27 Newton, Opticks or a Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections or Colours of Light (4th ed., New York: Dover Publication, 1952, Ist ed., 1704). 28 Newton (see note 27), p. 375. 29 Newton did not adhere to the motto Hypothèses nonfingo - I frame no hypothèses - in his Opticks as he did in his Principia (see note 26), p. 5. In the latter work he carefully informs the reader that he considers the force of attraction not to be physical but mathematical; „Wherefore the reader is not to imagine that by those words I anywhere take upon me to define the kind, or manner of any action, the causes or the physical reason thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, to certain centres (which are only mathematical points)." 30 Gowin Knight (London: n.p., 1748). 76</page><page sequence="9">how much may be effected by two such principles when directed by a Being of infinite wisdom? Although the phenomena of attraction and its companion, repulsion, are obvious to even the most casual observer, the strength of the concept for eighteenth-century thought lay in its formal expression as the law of gravity. This law simply stated that the force of attraction diminishes with the squares of the distances and increases with the product of the masses. Its most successful realization was observed in the motion of celestial bodies. However, as has been pointed out in Vaihinger, and again in the recent historiés of atomism, Newton'S celestial mechanics carefully stressed that bodies only tended to come closer as-if they were pulling one another, or that atoms flocked together or scattered as-if forces of attraction and repulsion drew or dispersed them.31 For Newton, all forces are accélération (f =m a), but the expression of this phenomenon is a mathematical convenience, a perspective conveniently forgotten by eighteenth-century thinkers. There was, to be sure, no reason to challenge the law of gravity, for even at the end of the eighteenth Century Simon Pierre Laplace was able to account for perturbations of celestial motion with the same law.32 Although his mathematical solutions were valid for an „idealized solar System," Laplace was unaware of the effect tidal friction has on the earth and he was still assuring the world of the reliability of the stellar clockwork. In the light of this small but effective déviation in the earth's motion, there was no basis for believing in an eternal perpétuation of the celestial machine, as Laplace did, nor was there any reason for believing in an early dissolution of the universe, as was feared in the eighteenth Century. It is understandable, therefore, that until sufficient evidence pointed to the contrary, actio in distans and its example in the attraction of gravity, would remain a valuable fiction for comprehending the stability of the universe. The limitations of the law of gravity as a conceptual aid were observed much earlier in the study of minute chemical bodies than in gross celestial bodies. Early chemists assumed that the language of the law of gravity was isomorphic with many other phenomena of nature. Some of the problems encountered in the transformation of the language of celestial physics to that of chemistry are recalled in William Nicholson'S dictionary of scientific terms at the end of the eighteenth Century. 31 In addition to the historiés of matter theory mentioned in note 4 there are many other critics who have pointed out that Newton had created in his physics an idealized universe. See, for example, Henry Guerlacs „Newton's Changing Reputation," in Carl Becker's Heavenly City Revisited (see note 3), pp. 8-17. 32 For a commentary on Laplace's solution to the perturbations of the planets see James R. Newman's (ed.) The World of Laws and the World of Chance (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1956), pp. 1316-33. 77</page><page sequence="10">The earlier philosophers observed, for example, that the attraction of gravitation acts upon bodies with a force which is inversely as the squares of the distances; and from mathematical déduction they have inferred, that the law of attraction between the particles themselves follows the same ratio.33 As Nicholson reports, chemists found the ratio between particles of small size to be much higher, probably the cubes of the distances between the centers of gravity, and later the „modems," such as the eighteenth-century scientist Torbern Bergmann, found these déductions too général, for they applied to spherical bodies which admitted little contact and were always the same on any side of the sphere. It is apparent that the mathematical law of gravity was useful for explaining the idealized State of celestial bodies but inappropriate for the more tangible world of chemistry. From our vantage point in the twentieth Century we may observe that the reality-or fiction-of the law of universal attraction was realized much earlier in chemistry than in astrophysics, where déviations were much less immediately observable. It is ironie that in this particular ideational drift the field of chemistry should encounter a more realistic compréhension of the universe than the science of physics; the science which other fields have tried to emulate for centuries. There is perhaps an important lesson to be learned from the attempt to transform the concept of actio in distans as a formal expression from one field to another. The lesson seems to be that fictions have a temporal threshold of usefulness and it is at this juneture that the scientist must be wary of his attachment to expressions, auxiliary words, and metaphors; and he must be exceptionally cautious of the language with which he frames his Systems of science. A closer look at Torbern Bergmanns research into the nature of chemical substances and at the work done in the field of optics might further illustrate the problems which fictions offer. Chemical Äff inities. By 1779, close to a Century after Newtons publications on mechanics and optics, Bergmann had defined and applied the law of gravity to the relationship of chemical substances under differing conditions. His studies were concerned with attraction at close range rather than attraction at a distance, and he found that particles at close range were in constant contact with an environment that varied the constituency of the particles and changed their mass. For example, particles which were melted together had greater attraction than did those only firmly compacted. From these observations, he offered a 33 William Nicholson, A Dictionary of Practical and Theoretical Chemistry (London: Phillips, 1808). 78</page><page sequence="11">taxonomy on the species of close range attractions which included: attractio aggregationis, attractio compositionis, attractio fusionis, simplex electiva, and attractio duplex.™ With the conceptual aid of actio in distans and some 30,000 experiments, Bergmann was able to organize the relationships of fifty-nine substances into „Attraktionstabelle." He had carried the earlier attraction tables of Étienne Geoffroy and Antoine Baumé to their logical conclusions, only to be superseded by a new system of atomic weights at the turn of the next Century. Several décades before the turn of the Century the tables of attraction began to show the signs of stress and strain which eventually destroy most useful fictions. As early as 1801 Claude Louis Berthollet made it the object of his Recherches sur les lois de l'affinité35 to ascertain if the quantity or the absolute weights of bodies must be considered in such tables. In his concluding chapters on the limits of elective affinities and on some errors which arise from false ideas of elective affinities, we find examples documenting the breakdown of the fiction. Berthollet commented on the affinity of acid in acidulous sulphate (sulphuric acid): „The illustrious Bergmann has, in this instance, widely deviated from the path which observation pointed out;" later he remarked, „The limit which Bergmann assigns to the actions of acids on the acidulous sulphate, is therefore imaginary ;" and finally he noted, „All classification of affinities rests on the false supposition that one acid expels another by the sole force of affinity, considered as a constant and uniform power."36 While Berthollet found the attraction tables to be an inadéquate system for comprehending the chemical substances, he was far from abandoning the conceptual aid afforded by the concept of actio in distans. Berthollet was simply arguing a broader view for the variables important to chemical affinity, including not only mass, but also the form of particles, their relation to solvents, and their volatility. Berthollet is a watershed figure in the history of chemistry and as such, his writings display a new language in which the old auxiliary words, or modus dicendi, no longer satisfy the requirements for documenting new information. That is, actio in distans had passed from its noble position as a useful fiction to one in which it served at most as a metaphor for explaining non-material relations. Optical Attraction. With a similar attachment actio in distans was employed by those in optical studies, although primarily in observations on the nature of 34 Tobern Bergmann, Kleine Physische und Chemische Werke, 5 vols., trans. Heinrich Tabor (Frankfurt: Garbe, 1782-89), Vol. 3, p. 363 ff. 35 Claude L. Berthollet, trans. M. Farrell (London: Murray, 1804, Ist French ed., 1801), pp. 80-102. 36 Berthollet (see note 35), p. 91 ff. 79</page><page sequence="12">light.37 Francesco Grimaldi had declared, in the seventeenth Century, that light was not a quality, as Aristotle believed, but was a substance, consisting of material particles as real as those considered by the chemists. The close relationship of optical and chemical study is not farfetched, for as we have observed from query thirty-one, Newton held that small particles of bodies act at a distance upon the rays of light; reflecting, refracting, and inflecting them. While there was a great deal of spéculation as to the nature of this luminous substance - Grimaldi saw it as various degrees of raréfaction in undulation - there was no doubt that light was subject to the principles of attraction and repulsion. As the writings of William Porterfield38 (1759) show, there was an attempt to apply the law of gravity to the motions of light and to the process of vision. Porterfield showed how the path of light was modified by the attraction of a surface. It follows that the law of refraction may be determined from the given density of any body, as he demonstrated how light passed from the aqueous to the crystalline, through the vitreous humors of the eye. While in chemistry there was an attempt to modify the formal expression of the force of attraction, there was no drift as such in optical actio in distans. Instead, the old dictum, that the force of attraction diminishes with the squares of the distance, was retained, although it served primarily to decorate explanations of the incidence of light on a surface. Descriptions of light made use of the laws of geometry, and the concept of actio in distans was, at most, a metaphor for describing the interaction of light and surfaces. Psychophysiological Vibrations and Association. As we have observed, the language of optics retained the formai expression of actio in distans primarily as a metaphor. In eighteenth-century studies of the psychology and physiology of vision39 there was no evidence of an attempt to employ the concept as a mathematical formula. Instead, it served more as an analogy in which the forces of the mental world are not the same as those in the natural world, but are similar in principle. In addition, the human sciences40 were far less developed than were 37 For important historiés of light and related topics see Vasco Ronchi'S The Nature of Light : an HistoricalSurvey, trans. V.

Hence, theoretical concepts such as actio in distans tended to become highly spéculative and to survive as fictions. David Hartley,42 ten years prior to Porterfield'S général theory of vision, proposed a physiology of vision that made attractive and répulsive forces as conformable to human functions as they were to functions of nature. Hartley attempted an explanation of the neurological origin of his „ideas of sensation," in which sensory vibrations became increasingly rarified as they passed from nerves to brain, and could be associated by temporal conjunction. For example, when he saw a steeple of a Gothic church, he was instantly reminded of the rest of the structure. These vibrations might also be associated successively; when the sounds of words began a familiar sentence, they brought the remainder of the sentence to mind in linear Order. These associations were brought about by vibrating motions in the medullary substance of the nerves and brain. It may therefore, be appropriate to label Hartley'S explanation of the psychophysio logical aspect of the visual process as mental chemistry for much of the terminology had also been used to describe chemical affinities. Some of the language even recalled Cartesian vortices,43 that archenemy of actio in distans, which postulated a universe of vortical plénums and forces acting by contact rather than at a distance. But Hartley'S consistent use of the terms attraction and repulsion clearly identifies him as a disciple of actio in distans, despite its logical unsuitability for a theory of vision based on vibrations. David Hume,44 in 1739, also developed a theory of vision which employed the concept of actio in distans by an analogy with Newton'S law of universal attraction.

According to Hume, the mind receives information from simple ideas which are copies of prior sensory impressions. He theorized that the différences in impressions and ideas lay in the strength with which they Struck the mind and entered the consciousness. Perceptions which entered with great force and violence were impressions, while the fainter images were ideas. The further removed in time the impressions were from their source, the fainter they became. Impressions through constant conjunction and the laws of associationism were recalled as complex ideas. The function of association was analogous to gravitation, for if ideas were loose and unconnected, joined by chance alone, it was impossible for the same simple ideas to align as complex ideas without some bond of union, some associating relation between them. Both the mental mechanics of Hume and the mental chemistry of Hartley employed the fiction of attractive and répulsive forces in nature as a model for their respective théories of vibrations and associationism. It is ironie that in the British tradition of empiricism two such spéculative théories should evolve. CulturalAntagonisms. There were many spéculative references to the actio in distans fiction in théories of human culture and it is not surprising that at the end of the Century Daniel Jenisch (1801 )47 would attempt a theory of cross-cultural similarities based on the doctrine of attraction and répulsion. Knight, Porterfield, and Hume had speculated regarding attractive forces, particularly in the relationships of human languages, words, and alphabetic and algebraic symbols.48 Hume even suggested that the great similarities in languages might be explained by an attracting bond, for the same impressions and simple ideas were perceived by individuals everywhere, regardless of cultural background.49 45 For a study in the development of association psychology the standard text is still Howard H. Warren'S/1 History of the Association Psychology (New York: Scribner's Sons, 1921). More recently and important for pointing to the relation of associationism to Gestalt psychology is Jean and George Mandler'S Thinking: From Association to Gestalt (New York: Wiley Sons, 1964). Neither work, however, synchronically relates associationism to eighteenth-century thought. 46 David Hume (see note 44) pp. 10-13. 47 Daniel Jenisch-s two major publications appeared at the turn of the Century and besides his history of eighteenth-century culture (see note 2) he wrote a theory of culture entitled Universal-historischer Ueberblick der Entwicklung des Menschengeschlechts, 3 vols. (Berlin: Voss, 1801). 48 Such references may be found in Knight (see note 30), p. 3; Hume (see note 44), p. 10; and Porterfield (see note 38), Vol. I, p. 295. 49 Such views are, however, today in conflict with the Whorf/Sapir hypothesis which states that it is precisely the language of each culture which shows unique conceptions of men and their environment. For a discussion of the hypothesis see Oswald Werner'S „Cultural Knowledge, 82</page><page sequence="15">Jenisch has the distinction in the history of anthropology, of developing the first comprehensive theory of culture displaying patterns of a culture rather than its diversities. For Jenisch, the concept of actio in distans was not simply a metaphor or an analogy, it was a fundamental mechanism as observable in culture as it had been in nature. In his theory of culture, Jenisch offered a taxonomy of „antagonisms"50 which generated the artifacts of human culture. The attraction of polarized human qualities (Anlagen) and drives (Triebe) led to ever more sophisticated levels of harmony and synthesis, i. e., similarities. The drives to technology, or tool-making, soon attracted aesthetic drives; for the construction of a tool such as a drinking cup soon led to its being decorated with colorful designs. At another generic level, play (Spiel) and urge (Bedürfnisgefühl) interacted to bring about such phenomena as finger manipulation or tobacco smoking. Jenisch listed a number of polarized drives and qualities which act upon one another such as imitation-originality, repose-activity, peace-war, instinct-intellect, or reason-passion. Using the fiction of actio in distans, Jenisch constructed a theory of culture consisting of a vast network of cultural entities held in balance by a tugging and pulling, not unlike the génération and stabilization of the galactic Systems Kant created fifty years earlier. Cosmic actio in distans. Although the concept of actio in distans has been sketched through a spectrum of writings, from théories of nature and of culture, we cannot forego adding one final example of the use of the concept primarily because of its significance for modern conceptions of the universe. In 1755 the concept became a fundamental device for Kant'S theory of the genesis and structure of the universe.51 Perhaps nowhere is the général use and power of the concept more poetically expressed than in Kants early „Vorkritische Schrif ten." Though the ubiquitous qualities of the concept as manifested in nature had been noted often in the eighteenth Century, it was presented by Kant as a divine and systematic force in the order of nature: Language and World View" in Paul Garvin's (ed.) Cognition : A Multiple View (New York: Spartan Books, 1970), pp. 155-75. 50 Daniel Jenisch (see note 47), Vol. 1, pp. 224-92. A current criticism of polarized processes and the terminology used to describe them is Sidney Hood's „Dialectic in Society and History," in Herbert Feigl and May Brodbeck's (eds.) Readings in the Philosophy of Science (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1953), pp. 701 13. An historical study ofpolarity concepts prior to Goethe may he found in Ewald A. Boucke-s work (see note 4). " Immanuel Kant, Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels oder Versuch von der Verfassung und dem mechanichen Ursprünge des ganzen Weltgebäudes, nach Newtonischen Grundsätzen (Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1902, Ist ed., 1755), Vol. l,pp. 215-368.

Hastie's English translation (Ann Arbor: University Press, 1969, Ist ed., 1900). 83</page><page sequence="16">After having resolved the world into the simplest chaos, I have applied no other forces than those of attraction and repulsion to the évolution of the great Order of nature: two forces which are both equally certain, equally simple, and, at the same time, equally original and universal.52 In KanT'S view attraction was a law of nature, established beyond doubt by Newton, and repulsion was demonstrated by subséquent research into the chemistry of matter. With this concept, or pair of concepts, Kant developed his system of the universe; minute particles evolved into clumps, into solar systems, and finally into an integrated world of worlds. Kants use of the concept actio in distans adds yet another dimension to its history. In his use of the concept, it retained both its formal and metaphoric value. When he observed our solar System and then structured galactic systems beyond our observation he performed a classic example of extrapolation. Although admittedly spéculative, it was not improbable that the concept of actio in distans could be extended to include Systems beyond our immédiate solar system. Indeed, modern cosmo logy has elaborated upon Kants notion of the growth and structure of the universe with a host of cosmic spectres such as hydrogen machines, primeval particles, „black holes," and initial „big bangs."53 Yet, despite new observations and more spéculation in the twentieth Century, Kants theory of the heavens continues to provide the basic framework for comprehending the universe. Although actio in distans was accepted as an article of Newtonian faith by many, there were also cases of more critical views, found in some belletristic writings.54 In Jonathan Swifts Gulliver's Travels, for instance, the great philosopher, Aristotle, acknowledges his many mistakes and attributes them to hasty conjectures. The philosopher explains: He found, that Gassendi, who had made the Doctrine of Epicurus as palatable as he could, and the ,vortices' of Descartes, were equally exploded. He predicted the same fate to ,attraction,' whereof the présent 52 Kant (see note 51), p. 35. 53 For the modem fictions of cosmology see Milton K. Munitz's (ed.) Theories of the Universe : From Babylonia Myth to Modem Science (New York: The Free Press, 1957), p. 271 ff. 54 Although Marjorie FI. Nicolson documented many examples of the populär réception of Newtonian science among poets, her study,Newton Demands The Muse: Newton's Opticksand the Eighteenth-century Poets (Priceton: University Press, 1946), does not cite actio in distans as an important factor in this réception. More recent studies of the poetization of science in eighteenth-century England include Donald Davie's The Language of Science and the Language of Literature, 1700-1740 (London: Sheed and Ward, 1963), and William P. Jones' The Rhetoric of Science, A Study of Scientific Ideas and Imagery in Eighteenth-Century English Poetry (Berkeley: University Press, 1966). For a survey of literature on the topic see Davie, pp. 1-20. 84</page><page sequence="17">learned are such zealous asserters. He said that new Systems of nature were but new fashions, which would vary in every age.55 In Goethe'S ballad „Wirkung in die Ferne"57 a tongue-in-cheek, clandestine love affair présents the conflict between believers in action at a distance and in action by contact. A page, on an errand for the Queen, and a beautiful lady in waiting, her dress soiled by a spilled drink, hurry from the banquet hall. The two chance to collide at some remote spot in the castle. They disengage, the lady continuing to her room and the page returning to the banquet hall. The Queen, seeing the page's vest soiled by contact with the lady, uses him as an object lesson. She renews an ancient argument with her Mistress of Cérémonies, a confirmed Cartesian plenist, and cites the soiled vest as an example of actio in distans. Belletristic writing had become a forum for the criticism of science, and Goethe'S allusions to actio in distans in Die WahlverwandschaftenS7 illustrate how far it could be carried. A ludicrous scene depicts Eduard and Charlotte, thinking of a third party on the eve of conception, causing their offspring to bear the physical features of the thought-partner. A truly critical view of concepts such as actio in distans had to await the efforts of nineteenth-century thinkers. While others in the nineteenth Century wrote on the idea of a fiction, it was Vaihinger'S as-if philosophy which gave fictions a positive value as useful and creative ideas. Despite their arbitrary déviations from reality, fictions are useful not only for scientific purposes, but, as Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, for making life endurable: We operate with things that do not exist, with lines, surfaces, bodies, atoms, divisible time, and divisible space; in truth a continuum is before us which we isolate into a few discrète entities. We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live - by assuming bodies, lines, surfaces, causes and effects, motion and rest, shape and content; without these articles of faith nobody would now be able to endure life.58 55 Jonathan Swift (New York: Ronald Press, 1938, Ist ed., 1726), p. 213. 56 Notes to the éditions carrying this poem such as the Jubiläums-Ausgabe (Berlin: Cotta, 1902), Vol I, p. 131, fail to recognize Goethe'S acquaintance with the history of atomism and attribute the stimulus of this poem to some parapsychological realm such as might have been introduced in his conversations with Zacharias Werner. 57 Johann W. Goethe (Weimar: Böhlau, 1892, Ist ed., 1809), Pt. I, Vol. 20, p. 54 ff. 58 Friedrich Nietzsche, Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1973, Ist ed., 1882), Vol. V2, p. 150 ff.

Indeed, the more creative the mind the more elaborate the fiction, as we have seen in the various monistic interprétations of nature and culture in the eighteenth Century. Although it may appear that the actio in distans fiction is a dead issue today, it is still fundamental in questions involving historical causation of influence.59 Causal statements are generally camouflaged behind terms'like roots, bases, undercurrents, and impact.60 In the historiés of the German language,61 for example, scholars have cloaked the powers of action-at-a-distance with terms such as „vowel undercurrents." In the early stages of the development of German, the „i" of a word such as „Kussian" purportedly affected the „u," changing it to Küssian. Ail this took place via at a distance, for the active agent had to penetrate the intermittent „s" consonant, or circumvent it, as is suggested by the term „vowel undercurrents." Historical studies are plagued by actio in distans fictions and often authors are unaware of their fictitious assertions62 and support them with a sériés of connective events which are much like Rube Goldberg devices. Vaihinger was able to issue his caveat that concepts like actio in distans are conventions63 and therefore, artificial and unreal. However, such caution is not original with Vaihinger, for in the history of science the originator of a useful fiction seldom equates it with reality as do secondary workers, who either take the specificity of the concept as real or allow it to fade into generality. We have observed how the concept actio in distans drifted through the eighteenth Century, at times as a précisé formai expression, at other times as an ordering 59 Johann Zedler lists in his encyclopedia (see note 41), Vol. 1-2, pp. 398-99, nine différent kinds of causal relations of which physical action at a distance is only one. A modern élaboration of traditional relations of the actions of causality may be found in John Stuart Mill'S A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive (Toronto: University Press, 1970, Ist ed., 1843), Vol. 7, pp. 323-78. 60 For a discussion of these and other terms see David H. Fischer's Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1970), pp. 164- 86. 61 See, for example, Adolf Bach'S Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache (8th ed., Heidelberg: Meyer, 1965), p. 139. 62 For an instructive example see a Marxist interprétation of history such as Boris M. Hessens discussion of „The Social and Economies Roots of Newton's .Principia'" in Science at the Crossroad (London: Kniga, 1931), pp. 151- 76. 63 While Moritz Schlick asks „Are Natural Laws Conventions?" in Herbert Feigl and May Brodbeck's (eds.) Readings in the Philosophy of Science (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1953), pp. 181-88, he concludes hesitantly that conventions play a role in the formulation of knowledge, but that does not mean propositions of science are arbitrary. However, Schlick'S question is still appropriate to study of the concept of actio in distans for, as Mary Hesse writes (see note 7) „The empirical issue between field theory and action at a distance at the most fundamental level of physics seems to be as wide open as ever." p. 14. 86</page><page sequence="19">principle for an entire System of knowledge. While the concept often served as a metaphor and as a modus dicendi, it also became a cumbersome commonplaçe intended to cover gaps in empirical observation. Although the concept became a topos of eighteenth-century thought, it also became a creative fiction that allowed Kant to extrapolate from the Newtonian laws of our solar system and evolve a cosmos beyond empiricial observation, while those like Hume created (or discovered) laws of association within the mental world, also beyond empirical observation. On occasion it was claimed that the concept was a tool of Divine Création; and, while its discovery belonged to collective mankind, its manifestations were yet to be discovered through the creative spirit common to scientist and artist. 87</page></plain_text>
