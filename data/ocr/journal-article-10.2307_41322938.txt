<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Green Myth - Economic Growth and the Quality of the Environment by Marian Radetzki, (Essex, UK: Multi-Science Publishing Co., 2001), 84 pages. ISBN 0-906522- 17-X. There is a common notion that economic growth and environmental quality are diametrically opposed. Radetzki in this well argued monograph tries to convince us otherwise. In his work, he couches growth in terms of GDP as the least ambiguous and most available measure of economic growth, while recognizing that economic well being is clearly multi-dimensional. He considers two measures of environmental quality - a green theory of value and an anthropocentric theory of value. The green theory of value gives primary importance to the biosphere over the interests of humans. The most extreme elements in this movement - the deep ecologists - value nature over the artificial output of human activities with a goal of returning to the environmental situation before the land fell under the attack of voracious humans. The anthropomorphic view of the world values the environment in terms of how it influences human interests. Environmental states can be compared to each other. Environmental anthropocentrists recognize that there is a trade off between the environment and additional goods and services. They try to pick an optimal environmental state, one that assures survival, which is a reasonably objective goal, and comfort, which is much more subjective. Although Radetzki comes</page><page sequence="2">134 / The Energy Journal down squarely on the side the anthropocentric approach, he argues that the green theory of value must be taken seriously, because it often has the ear of politicians and policy makers. Humans damage their environments for a variety of reasons - because of externalities, because benefits are valued more than the damages, and because of ignorance. Rectifying this damage, whatever its causes, is thought by many to be a constraint to economic growth. Radetzki argues, however, that empirical evidence fails to support such thoughts. He uses both anecdotal and statistical evidence to convince the reader. Developed countries or countries with a higher density of economic activity tend to be cleaner. Many developing countries are at the stage of industrialized countries 100 years ago when sanitation was low. Animal manure littered the streets, sewage was not properly cared for, and disease was much more rampant. As countries get rich enough (he quotes $8,000 per capita as the turning point) environmental indicators improve. This happens for three reasons. (1) As income increases, humans want to adapt the environment to their own needs. (2) They begin to adjust their behavior in response to environmental constraints. (3) Environmental quality is a luxury good. Humans tend to congregate in artificial micro-environments that protect them from the macro-environment. As they congregate they put stress on the environment and on natural resources. This stress has led to property rights and regulations of the commons along with the substitution of human for natural capital. For example, rubber plantations have replaced naturally collected rubber from forests, fish farms now provide 20% of world supply of fish, and fishing regulations monitor the wild catch more heavily than ever before. Timber plantations have been substituted for natural forests. Dirty water can be purified and fertilizer has substituted for guano. Fiber optics and mobil phones have substituted for telephone lines. Environmental regulations have become more encompassing and are hopefully becoming more economically efficient as command and control types of policy are replaced or supplemented with market based policies such are marketable permits. He suspects that just as countries have used metals less intensively per dollar of GDP as they got richer and moved from heavy industry to service and information-based economies, they will also use the environment less intensively. This movement away from environmental intensity will be supported by consumer preferences for a cleaner environment. He bolsters his arguments with examples from formerly planned economies, which despite protestations of concern for the public welfare, have had the most egregious violations of the environment. He maintains there were a number of reasons for this poor environmental record. They were middle-income developing countries, which is the stage of highest environmental resource intensity. Their over-all economic inefficiency required higher levels of investment for economic growth. Dictatorial governments were unresponsive to people's environmental</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews / 135 preferences. As these governments have been swept aside, their environmental preferences have become increasingly vocal. In the past, as countries have developed, after a certain point they got both richer and cleaner. So far that growth has been sustainable. But will it be sustainable in the future? Although basically optimistic, Radetzki does consider some of the possibilities for unsustainable growth which he contends could arise from three possible sources - depletion of environmental and natural resources, stress from rising population or some sort of unintentional environmental collapse. He is optimistic that knowledge and human made capital will be available to substitute for environmental and natural resources. From current indications, he believes that population growth will level off before reaching 10 billion, if income continues to increase. An easing of population growth should make sustainability an easier task. This leaves some sort of unintentional effect of human activity that would make current economic activity unsustainable, which could include global climate change, nuclear accident, problems from genetic uniformity of major crops that make them vulnerable to disease and pests, or even an as yet unknown problem from new technologies or economic activity. Although none of these factors can be totally dismissed, he argues that as we learn more about the causal relationships of our activities, we can bring these risks down. Careful economic analysis does not support popular claims of natural- resource disaster. Radetzki, following earlier work by Barnett and Morse and more recent work by Julian Simon, again shows this to be true. However, this lack of economic support needs reiteration to counter the repetition of poorly supported contrary views. This book would be appropriate for a general audience with concerns over the sustainability of economic growth and environmental quality. Opinions on this front seem to come in two flavors - pessimism and optimism. Although, this view from a contrarian may not convince the pessimists that utter ruin is not just around the corner, hopefully he will provide them some food for thought. Optimists will probably find his arguments more refreshing, palatable, and easy to digest.
