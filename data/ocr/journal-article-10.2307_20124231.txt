<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL STUDY SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-U NI VERSE, II * RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN IV. Persons In the conclusion of the last section, we suggested that it is illuminating to compare Sellars' philosophy with that of Kant. This can clearly be seen with reference to his attack on the "myth of the given," 15 his positive analysis of concepts, and his classifica tion of the manifest image as phenomenal. But the analogy with Kant is also helpful in clarifying two further notions that are essential for completing the sketch of Sellars ' system : persons and reality. Although Sellars has written a number of papers that delineate and defend the logic of intentions,16 which is the heart of what is distinctive about persons, one topic that he has not explored in great detail is the "unity of the persons." The category of persons which is the fundamental category of the manifest image and which must be joined with the scientific image if we are to achieve a true synoptic vision of man-in-the-universe presents a central difficulty for Sellars' systematic edifice. For he attempts * The first part of this Critical Study of Wilfrid Sellars', Science, Perception and Reality (New York: Humanities Press, 1963) appeared in this Review, 20, 1 (September, 1966) ; all page references in the text are to Science, Perception and Reality. 15 Sellars claims that not even Kant has completely escaped from "the framework of givenness." "This framework has been a common feature of most of the major systems of philosophy, including, to use a Kantian turn of phrase, both 'dogmatic rationalism' and 'sceptical empiricism'. It has, indeed, been so pervasive that few, if any, philosophers have been altogether free of it; certainly not Kant, and, I would argue, not even Hegel, that great foe of 'immediacy' " (p. 127). 16 On the logic of intention and action, see "Obligation and Motiva tion," Philosophical Studies, 2 (1950) and the revision of this article in Readings in Ethical Theory, ed. by W. Sellars and J. Hospers (New York, 1952); see also "Imperatives, Intentions and the Logic of 'Ought,' Methodos, 8 (1956) and the revision of this article in The Language of Con duct, ed. by G. Nakhnikian and H. Casta?eda (Detroit, 1963).</page><page sequence="2">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 291 to show the compatibility of what at first seem to be contradictory claims. On the one hand he maintains (although I do not think that he has shown this) that a reconstruction of the category of persons in terms of the fundamental concepts of the scientific image "is in principle impossible, the impossibility in question being a strictly logical one" (p. 38). On the other hand, he claims that persons can in principle be exhaustively described and explained in terms of the scientific image. A person is nothing more than a multiplicity of logical subjects and the precise nature of these subjects can eventually be revealed in the development of scientific inquiry. These claims would be contradictory if Sellars held that all legitimate conceptual frameworks are essentially frameworks of description and explanation. One of the major themes of his investigations is that there are a variety of different types of irreducible conceptual frameworks. Once again it is essential to appreciate that the terms "description" and "explanation" are being used in a restricted and technical sense. If the category of persons cannot be reconstructed in the fundamental concepts of the scien tific image, doesn't this mean that there really is something over and above the entities ultimately countenanced by the scientific image? Everything here hinges on how we understand "some thing." If we interpret this to mean that there is a type of entity in the world that must be said to exist over and above scientific entities, then Sellars ' answer is a categorical no. Metaphorically, we can say that there is more to a person than what can be scientifically described and explained. But this "more" is not something more to be described and explained, it is a matter of doing, specifically the type of activity we engage in when we rehearse an intention. This is why Sellars speaks of joining the scientific framework with the conceptual framework of persons rather than reconciling the two frameworks. If both frameworks were rival frameworks for saying what there is, then we would have a serious problem of reconciling them. But presumably, once we realize that the conceptual framework of persons is not one for saying what is the case, but rather "the language of com munity and individual intentions" (p. 40), the problem of onto logical bifurcation dissolves. If the conceptual framework of per</page><page sequence="3">292 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN sons involves no ontological claims, then there is no issue of reconciling competing ontological claims. If this shift to viewing the framework of persons as a frame work of doing or acting is more than a verbal dodge, we have a right to ask just what Sellars means and how does this perspective clarify the difficult issue of accounting for the unity of persons. Sellars tells us: To do justice to this unity [of persons] we must, it would seem, take it to be ultimate and irreducible, and in effect, commit ourselves to either a Platonic or an Aristotelian ontology of the 'L' That this is not so is the fruit of a line of thought initiated by Kant. As in the case of the status of the framework of physical objects, he sketched the form of a solution, giving it, however, a metaphysical content which must be replaced by scientific considerations. The heart of the matter is the fact that the irreducibility of the T within the framework of first person discourse (and, indeed 'you' and 'he' as well) is com patible with the thesis that persons can (in principle) be exhaustively described in terms which involve no reference to such an irreducible logical subject. For the description will mention rather than use the framework to which these logical subjects belong. Kant saw that the transcendental unity of apperception is a form of experience rather than a disclosure of ultimate reality. If persons are "really" multi plicities of logical subjects then unless these multiplicities used the conceptual framework of persons there would be no persons. But the idea that persons 'really are' such multiplicities does not require that concepts pertaining to persons be analyzable into concepts pertaining to sets of logical subjects. Persons may 'really be' bundles, but the concept of a person is not the concept of a bundle, (pp. 100 f.) The comment that Sellars makes about Kant can, in turn, be made about him. For at best he has presented us with the form of a solution rather than the solution itself. Sellars has not yet an swered the question, precisely what does it mean and how do the sets of logical subjects which persons "really are" use the con ceptual framework of persons. Later we shall consider some diffi culties concerning this way of viewing persons, but Sellars' line of argument is consistent with, and an application of his ontological monism and his linguistic pluralism. He is consistent in main taining that there is one and only one framework that tells us what there is?the scientific framework?while claiming that there are other types of irreducible frameworks?in this case, the framework of persons?which are compatible with and supplement the onto logical primacy of the scientific image.</page><page sequence="4">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 293 V. Scientific Realism There is one final major issue that has been in the foreground of our discussion of persons that we have not yet squarely faced? the meaning of the concept of reality. The concept of reality has played a key role at every turn of Sellars' philosophy. He fre quently makes what appear to be dramatic claims about what is real and what is not real. He tells us "that physical objects of ordinary perceptual experience don't really exist" (p. 98); that "correspondence rules would appear in the material mode as state ments to the effect that the objects of the observational framework do not really exist?there really are no such things" (p. 126) ; and, that "speaking as a philosopher, I am quite prepared to say that the common sense world of physical objects in Space and Time is unreal?that is, there are no such things . . . that in the dimension of describing and explaining the world, science is the measure of all things, of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not" (p. 173). We have the feeling that something important and provocative is being asserted. But if we are to discover the signif icance of these claims, we must find out what it means to assert that something is real or unreal. There are three major motifs that enter Sellars' analysis of the concept of reality: (i) his analysis of the logically perspicuous schema for making existence claims; (ii) his criticism and revision of Carnap's semantical program; (iii) his criticism of the "stand ard" picture of the relation between theoretical and observation languages. Joining issue with the discussion of ontological commitment of conceptual frameworks that has been so extensively treated in the philosophic literature of the twentieth century, Sellars asks, what is the relation between existentially quantified formulae and existence claims? His answer is that "there is no general correspondence between existentially quantified formulae and existence statements. Only in those cases where the variable which is quantified is a variable of which the values are singular terms will the quantified formula be the counterpart of an existence statement. Nor is this all; not even all (so-called) existential quantification over singular</page><page sequence="5">294 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN term variables has the force of an existence statement. For the latter involve common nouns or expressions having the force of common nouns" (p. 255). The paradigm for making perspicuous existence statements is "'(Ei) i is an N' where T is a variable taking singular terms of a given type as its values, and 'N' is an appropriate common noun" (p. 256). We can appreciate what Sellars is up to here by seeing how this analysis dovetails with the rest of his philosophy. One of Sellars' main objectives has been to untangle the web of con fusions surrounding the discussion of abstract entities. Roughly speaking, abstract entities turn out to be linguistic "entities"? they belong to the logical order?and they are not strictly speaking constituents in the world. But at the same time Sellars does think that discourse about abstract entities is indispensible and irreduc ible. He claims that it is legitimate and necessary to use expres sions for abstract entities in well formed existentially quantified formulae. If one accepted the criterion that "to be is to be the value of a bound variable" and held that abstract entities are among the values of bound variables, then one would be committed to the existence of abstract entities. It is precisely this consequence that Sellars rejects. This is the philosophic "bite" of his claim that there is no general correspondence between existentially quantified formulae and genuine existence statements. Sellars allows for the force of the platonist's claim that we simply cannot say all that needs to be said without the use and mention of "abstract entities," and that it is perfectly legitimate to use expressions standing for abstract entities in well formed existentially quantified formulae. However, Sellars pulls the ontological rug out from under the platonists by arguing that these admissions do not entail the existence of abstract entities. More formally, we can say "to quantify over an adjective-, common noun-, or sentence variable is not to make the PMese equivalent of a statement asserting the existence of attributes, kinds, or propositions" (p. 257). How does Sellars' proposed schema help to clarify what there really is? By itself, Sellars' schema, like Quine 's, is relative to a specific conceptual or linguistic framework. It tells us what a given framework "says" there is, or what are the ontological com mitments of a given framework, not what there really is. We</page><page sequence="6">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 295 seem to be left with an ontological relativism that would satisfy many philosophers, but not Sellars. Before exploring how Sellars employs this schema, it is neces sary to expose another way in which philosophers have mistakenly thought we are committed to the existence of entities. The issue can be located with reference to Sellars ' interpretation and criticism of Carnap's semantical program. Sellars argues that the use of semantical discourse does not by itself commit us to the existence of any entities. According to Sellars, Carnap's "reconstruction commits one to the idea that if a language is meaningful, there exists a domain of entities (the designata of its names and pred icates) which exists independently of any concept formation. Of course, Carnap's semantical theory involves no commitment as to what this domain includes, but if one adds the premiss that the physical thing language is meaningful, one is committed to the idea that the framework of observable physical things and their properties has an absolute reality which ... it does not have" (p. 109). Carnap's semantics is not nearly as neutral or tolerant as might first appear. When we put Carnap's interpretation of semantics together with his claim about the meaningfulness of a physical thing language, some very strong and controversial onto logical conclusions follow. Here too, Sellars rejects the conclu sion that the designata of the names and predicates of the physical thing language exist. We know that for Sellars the physical things of the common sense framework or the physical thing language do not exist. But how is one to avoid the consequence that physical things do exist ? The overall strategy of Sellars in analyzing semantics is es sentially the same as his strategy in dissolving the ontological commitment to abstract entities (these are two aspects of the same problem). There has been a bias in a good deal of contemporary analytic philosophy that if we can show that certain expressions (usually referring expressions) are meaningful and indispensible then we are somehow committed to the existence of corresponding entities. Sellars has persistently argued that this is a mistake, one which he has attempted to expose in a variety of contexts. Further more, it is a mistake that is as characteristic of philosophers with a "bloated ontology" as it is of those philosophers who think that a</page><page sequence="7">296 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN tough-minded nominalism requires us to show that forms of dis course that refer to abstract entities must be dispensable or reducible. There is simply no general correspondence between the forms of discourse that we recognize as meaningful and our ontological commitments. But if we can refer to abstract entities in existentially quantified formulae without being committed to their existence and if we can say that forms of discourse such as the physical thing language or observation language are meaningful without being committed to the (absolute) existence of the entities that are referred to in these languages, when and where do we make legitimate existence claims? To answer this question, we must examine the third motif that we mentioned, the relation between theoretical and observa tion languages. Sellars' reservations about the ontological commitments of a physical thing language, or, more generally, about an observation language, raises a broader and more controversial issue. He challenges what has come to be accepted as a "dogma" in a good deal of recent philosophy of science. The "picture" that pervades much of the thinking about the relation of theoretical and observa tion languages is one of a hierarchy of levels. At the bottom we have what Sellars picturesquely calls "Explained Nonexplainers," at the intermediate level we have "Explained Explainers," and at the top we have "Unexplained Explainers." The bottom level consists of reports of particular matters of fact, while the inter mediate level consists of inductive generalizations. According to this picture, inductive generalizations serve as principles for ex plaining particular matters of fact (the latter can be derived from their corresponding generalizations). But these inductive gener alizations are themselves explained by theories where we can derive empirical laws from theoretical postulates by means of logic, math ematics, and correspondence rules. Such a picture lends support to the idea that the level of particular matters of fact is the basic level upon which all theory directly or indirectly rests. (There can, of course, be sharp disagreement about whether the language of this basic level is physicalistic or whether such a language is itself "theoretical" and can rest upon a more basic phenomenalistic</page><page sequence="8">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 297 language. But such disagreements accept the idea that there is some basic level of observational discourse.) Sellars thinks that this notion of levels is mistaken. (Note the family resemblence among the metaphors "levels," "foundation," and "myth of the given.") Theories about observable things "explain empirical laws by explaining why observable things obey to the extent that they do, these empirical laws; that is, they explain why individual objects of various kinds and in various circumstances in the observation framework behave in those ways in which it has been inductively established that they do behave. Roughly, it is because a gas is?in some sense of 'is'?a cloud of molecules which are behaving in certain theoretically defined ways, that it obeys the empirical Boyle-Charles law" (p. 121). The question now becomes, what does it mean to say that a gas 'is' a cloud of molecules?or more generally, what does it mean to say that the macro-objects that we observe are or consist of im perceptible micro - entities ? The answer is that while it would be incorrect to attribute identity of sense or reference of the basic vocabulary of an observation framework and a theoretical frame work, it is possible to envision the replacement of an observation framework by an appropriate theoretical one. In delineating the possibility of such a replacement, Sellars' interpretation of the role of correspondence rules is central. Correspondence rules express "more than a factual equivalence but less than an identity of sense" between expressions in the observation and theoretical frameworks. These rules are to be "regarded as statements to the effect that cer tain redefinitions of observation terms would be in principle acceptable" (p. 125). This interpretation of correspondence rules explains "how theoretical complexes can be unobservable, yet 'really' identical with observable things" (p. 126). Consequently, although an observation framework has important methodological priority, it does not have any ultimate epistemological or ontological priority. Sellars envisions the abandonment, in principle, of the entire ob servation framework and its replacement with a theoretical frame work. The way is now open to challenge the ultimate validity of an observation, or physical thing, or common sense framework. The stage is now set for the final act of Sellars' ontological</page><page sequence="9">298 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN drama. Neither the use of existentially quantified formulae, nor the use of semantical discourse, nor the use of an observation or physical thing language involves us in any absolute commitment to corresponding entities. We have a schema for deciding what exists, but thus far the application of this schema is not entirely clear. Paradoxically such a schema seems to be ontologically neutral, in the sense that its use is relative to a given conceptual framework and there can be a plurality of such frameworks. But we can now add that "to have good reason for holding a theory is ipso facto to have good reason for holding that the entities postulated by the theory exist" (p. 91). Putting this together with Sellars' interpretation of the relation of theoretical and observation languages?especially the claim that it is possible to redefine obser vation terms in a theoretical language?we can finally understand what Sellars means when he tells us that the objects of the observa tion framework do not really exist. Because if it is possible to replace the observation framework?if we can really eliminate it in favor of a scientific theory which we have good reasons to accept, then we no longer have an adequate reason for asserting that the basic entities of the observation framework really exist. We may continue to acknowledge the methodological priority of the obser vation framework, but we will say that those entities that satisfy the schema for existence statements in an adequate scientific theory are the only entities that really exist. If one should point out that this entails that we cannot know what are the ultimate real con stituents of the universe until science is completed (if this is pos sible), Sellars accepts the consequence with equanimity. In a Peircean spirit, he will say that as science progresses we approx imate a more adequate conception of what there really is (the entities postulated by a more comprehensive and adequate scien tific theory are closer to the real constituents of the universe than those entities postulated by a less adequate theory). But there is nothing absurd or irrational in claiming that the better our scien tific theories, the better our knowledge of the entities that are the ultimate constituents of the universe. This is the core of Sellars' scientific realism. It avoids the ontological relativism character istic of the linguistic turn in philosophy by showing us that we can challenge the legitimacy of entire frameworks, even those that</page><page sequence="10">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 299 seem to be as firmly grounded as our common sense discourse about physical objects. And in challenging the legitimacy of such frameworks, we are claiming that it is possible in principle to replace them by better and better (finally the best) theoretical frameworks. * * * With this discussion of the ingredients of Sellars' scientific realism, we have completed the outlines of his philosophic system. Sellars' explorations exhibit four characteristics of traditional, sys tematic philosophy: (i) Pervasive themes shape his discussion of specific issues. For example, there is the pervasive theme of onto logical monism and linguistic pluralism. Sellars has argued that there is only one framework that tells us what there really is, but he has delineated the essential characteristics of other irreducible frameworks?such as the frameworks of semantics and persons? that are essential for the synoptic vision of "discourse-about-man-in all-discourse." (ii) The analyses that he offers of specific issues have clear and far-reaching consequences for almost all other central issues. For example, Sellars' scientific realism has direct consequences for his conception of the status of persons, thought, the relation of theory and observation, etc. In this respect Sellars' philosophy exhibits a feature characteristic of dialectical philos ophers where what they say about any particular issue affects and is affected by what they say about any other central issue, (iii) All the problems that Sellars discusses can (indeed must) be viewed in terms of their contribution to a coherent, comprehensive, synoptic view of man-in-the-universe. The specific discussions of semantics, grammar, thought, sensation, existence, etc., are stages of the grand strategy of a total "articulated and integrated vision." (iv) Although Sellars certainly has not yet taken up all the issues that have been central to traditional and contemporary philosophy, one can begin to discern how Sellars would approach issues not yet explicitly explored.17 17 For detailed discussion of issues not treated in this study, see the following: on time, "Time and the World Order," Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, III, ed. by H. Feigl and G. Maxwell (Minneapolis,</page><page sequence="11">300 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN In laying bare the skeletal outlines of Sellars ' philosophic sys tem we have deliberately refrained from developing criticisms and examining difficulties. The first task has been to see how the pieces fit together and to gain an overall perspective on some of the tortuous paths that Sellars follows. But we now have enough of his philosophic system laid bare to begin the task of evaluation. VI. Perplexities The procedure that we have followed thus far has been to con sider Sellars ' general thesis about the primacy of the scientific image and the problems that this poses for understanding the status of thought and language, sensations and feelings, persons, and the concept of reality. In each of these general areas, there are central difficulties that we now want to explore. Let us begin by taking a closer look at the thesis that the scientific image has ontological primacy. One is tempted to say about this thesis what Sellars has said about the identity theory of mind-body, viz., "the theory is either very exciting but false, or true but relatively trivial."18 The reasons for saying this are similar to the reasons that Sellars offers in regard to the identity theory. In what sense is the thesis about the primacy of the scientific image "exciting but false?" Here Sellars is our best guide. If one interpreted the thesis as meaning that everything that we can now legitimately do or say within the manifest image can, in prin ciple, be reconstructed in the scientific image, then the thesis is 1963); on induction, "Induction as Vindication," Philosophy of Science, 31 (1964); on particulars, "The Logic of Complex Particulars," Mind, 58, (1949) and "Particulars," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, II (1950); on abstract entities, "Abstract Entities," and "Classes as Abstract Entities and the Russell Paradox," The Review of Metaphysics, 16, 17 (1963); on counterfactuals and causation, "Counterfactuals, Dispositions and Causal Modalities," Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, II, ed. by H.

Sellars has persistently argued that such a reconstruction is not possible?logically impossible. But there is even a weaker sense in which the thesis is false. Disregarding the problem of "persons," it isn't even true that everything we now describe in the manifest image could be reconstructed in a scientific image that does not include primitive predicates that are the theoretical counterparts of our present "raw feel" predicates. The logical space of "raw feels," he tells us, "will reappear transposed but unreduced in a theoretical framework adequate to the job of explaining what core persons can do."19 Consequently, if one interpreted the primacy of the scientific image as meaning that it is possible to reconstruct everything that we describe and explain into a theoret ical framework that included among its primitive predicates only those necessary for describing and explaining the inorganic world, then again the thesis is false. But then, in what sense is the primacy thesis true and why are we tempted to say that it is trivial? The cash value of the primacy thesis is that a scientific frame work could, in principle, replace the manifest image as a better conceptual scheme for describing and explaining what is the case ?for saying what there is. This claim certainly doesn't appear to be trivial. But everything depends on the meaning of the terms "description" and "explanation." The concept of description has already caused Sellars some trouble in his exchange with Chisholm, and Sellars has admitted that his technical use of the concept departs from some of the ways in which it is ordinarily used20?one can add that it departs from the way in which many philosophers have used the concept. What is Sellars' paradigm of description? His bias is clearly revealed when he tells us that "the key to the answer is the realiza tion that describing is internally related to explaining, in the sense of 'explanation' which comes to full flower in scientific explanation ?in short, causal explanation."21 But this claim is strikingly 19 Ibid., p. 449. 20 "Intentionality and the Mental," Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, II, p. 539. 21 "Empiricism and Abstract Entities," The Philosophy of Rudolf Car nap, ed. by P. A. Schilpp (LaSalle, Illinois, 1963), p. 451.</page><page sequence="13">302 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN ambiguous. It is not clear whether such a proposal is intended to be part of an analysis of the concept of description, or whether Sellars is simply stipulating what he considers to be description. It may mean that, given the multifarious uses of description and the many types of expression that we count as descriptions, Sellars can show that either they are not really descriptions at all or that they can be "reduced" (in some sense to be specified) to the type of description that "comes to full flower" in scientific description. This ambiguity becomes particularly acute when we realize that one of the fruits of recent analytic philosophy as well as continental phenomenology has been to make us sensitive to the variety of expressions that we consider to be legitimate descriptions. It certainly isn't obvious that this variety can be reduced or replaced by a single type or class of descriptions. On the contrary, it appears that the search for a single paradigm for what is to count as description is unwarranted. We can illustrate this point with one recent discussion of the concept of description. In The Ex planation of Behaviour, Charles Taylor analyzes and defends a notion of "intentional description" as the sort of description that something "bears for a certain person, the description under which it is subsumed by him." He claims that "the notion of act as directed behavior involves that of an intentional description."22 And while Taylor would agree that describing is internally related to explaining, he challenges the thesis that the only legitimate type of explanation is what Sellars calls "causal explanation." The point in citing this illustration?which is typical of the recent discussion of action?is not simply to oppose one philosophic view to another. It is rather to emphasize that the significance of Sellars' primacy thesis depends upon a clear analysis and justifica tion of the technical and restricted use of "description" that he employs. For the clash of the two images can be pinpointed in determining whether it is possible to displace the types of correct descriptions that we make in the manifest image by those used in the scientific image. Perhaps we can, but the burden of proof falls upon Sellars. One might object that, of course, there are a variety of types of description, but what we describe in the manifest 22 The Explanation of Behavior (New York, 1964), p. 58.</page><page sequence="14">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 303 image or what phenomenologists describe when they offer us phenomenological descriptions is appearance and not reality. But such an objection is self-defeating. For according to Sellars, the ontological issue is supposedly clarified by determining what sort of framework is supreme when it comes to describing and explain ing the world. What Sellars must show us (and what he fails to show us) is that there is one type or class of descriptions that is the paradigm for describing what there is.23 Unless he can show this, then the primacy thesis is in danger of becoming trivial. It looks as if Sellars is saying something like the following: "Insofar as we use the manifest image to give a scientific description and explanation of the world, this function can be better achieved by theoretical science proper." When we keep in mind that not everything we say or do in the manifest image is to describe and explain, and furthermore that not everything that we consider to be correct description and explanation in the manifest image can be reconstructed in the scientific image, then it does look as if the claim that the scientific image has primacy is "true but relatively trivial." This amounts to little more than the claim that in performing the tasks of scientific description and explanation, theoretical science is supreme. The type of perplexity that arises in what seems to be Sellars ' stipulative use of "description" is closely related to another point. Suppose one attempted to come to Sellars' defense by maintaining that the manifest image is really some sort of theory which can in principle be replaced by a better theory. Then, of course, the problems we have suggested would simply dissolve. One might concede that the type of descriptions and explanations that we 23 The difficulty that we are locating here is not the same as the one Sellars concedes. He admits that in ordinary discourse, the "unpacking" of a description may involve "the term 'ought* or some other prescriptive expression" ("Counterfactuals, Dispositions, Causal Modalities," p. 283). Nevertheless, he does think that there is an "ideal of pure description." It is this ideal that we are questioning. For even when we separate out pre scriptive and modal components of expressions that we normally consider to be descriptions, we still seem to be left with a variety of different types of description. On the concept of description, see Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations (New York, 1953) $$ 99, 159, 162, 188, 189. See also Richard Taylor, Action and Purpose (Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1966) pp. 99 ff.</page><page sequence="15">304 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN offer in the manifest image are different?radically different?than those used in the best scientific theories. Nevertheless this is no obstacle to seeing the falsity of the manifest image; rejecting the manifest image would be analogous to rejecting one scientific theory in favor of a better one. And the type of reasons appro priate here would be the same as those that we use in evaluating competing scientific hypotheses. But Sellars himself has explicitly considered this possibility and rejected it, i.e., he has argued that even though the manifest image contains rudimentary theories, it is not itself a quasi scientific theory.24 While I think that Sellars is correct in stressing the disanalogy between the manifest image and scientific theories, this creates further difficulties for his primacy thesis. In explicat ing his version of scientific realism, Sellars has argued that, in principle, it would be possible to abandon an observation language or a common sense framework of physical objects and replace them by a more adequate scientific theory. What we would be doing is suggesting that certain redefinitions of the basic vocab ulary of these frameworks by theoretical definitions "would in principle be acceptable." But such notions as "adequate" and "acceptable" are loaded. Adequate for what and acceptable to whom? What are the criteria or the guidelines for determining whether a proposed redefinition is acceptable? What kinds of reasons would count as good reasons hereP If "adequate" simply means adequate for the purposes of scientific description and ex planation, once again the primacy thesis is in danger of becoming trivial. Sellars appears to be caught in a dilemma here: the more he stresses that abandonment in principle of the manifest image is a matter of proposing redefinitions of the basic vocabularly of this framework, the more he seems to be assuming that the manifest image is some sort of scientific theory which can be replaced by a better scientific theory; but the more he stresses the disanalogy between the manifest image and scientific theories, the greater the confusion and unclarity about what would count as good reasons 24 See "Scientific Realism or Irenic Instrumentalism," Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, II, ed. by Robert S. Cohen and Marx Wartofsky (New York, 1965).</page><page sequence="16">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 305 for replacing the manifest image by the scientific image. In short, the crucial issue here is getting clear about the rules, criteria, and guidelines of that framework or perspective by which we can evaluate the manifest image and determine whether certain redefinitions of basic terms are acceptable. And Sellars has failed to make clear precisely what are ground rules for this metaframe work of critical evaluation. Thus far we have been considering some perplexities con cerning the significance of the claim that the scientific image has ontological primacy, i.e., that it is the measure of the "really real," but now we want to examine some of the specific arguments in support of this thesis. Sellars has failed to overcome the three obstacles that stand in the way of asserting this thesis. Let us begin with an examination of "raw feels," for Sellars' entire program almost goes to wreck here. Roughly speaking, the solu tion that he offers to the problem posed by "raw feels" is that "raw feel" predicates will appear transposed but unreduced in a scientific framework adequate for describing and explaining what we now call " sensory consciousness. " Some preliminary reservations about this "solution" have already been indicated, because it looks as if Sellars is engaging in some risky speculations about what the science of the future must look like. One would think that the issue of whether the science of the future will be physicah or physical2-but-not-physicali is a scientific matter and not a philo sophic one.25 But Sellars does think that this is a philosophic issue and that there is something about "raw feel" predicates that entitles us to say now; that these cannot be reduced or defined in terms of more primitive theoretical predicates in the science of the future. There are two opposing criticisms that we can make: 25 "Physical^ an event or entity is physical if it belongs in the space-time network. Physical2: an event or entity is physical2 if it is definable in terms of theoretical primitives adequate to describe completely the actual states though not necessarily the potentialities of the universe before the appearance of Life" ("The Concept of Emergence," Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, I, ed. by H. Feigl and M. Scriven [Minneapolis, 1956], p. 252). For a defense of the claim that the issue of whether the science of the future is physical or physicalg-but-not-physicah is a scientific issue and not a philosophic one, see H. Feigl, "The 'Mental' and the 'Physical,' " Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, II, p. 425.</page><page sequence="17">306 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN (i) that there is no a priori reason to think that an adequate scientific framework must include primitive "raw feel" predicates; (ii) that insofar as we accept Sellars' characterization of what is distinctive about "raw feel" predicates, the theoretical counter parts that he envisions as the replacement of these predicates lack this distinctive feature. An essential part of Sellars' strategy in challenging the absolute existence of the objects of an observation or perceptual framework has been to argue that it is possible, in principle, to replace these frameworks by a "better" theoretical framework. Correspondence rules are to be regarded as statements to the effect that certain redefinitions of observation and perceptual terms would be accept able. Furthermore, it is possible to enrich such a theoretical language with a reporting role which could replace our present language for making observation and perceptual reports?includ ing reports of what we now consider private experiences. De veloping this line of thought, Sellars acknowledges that, in prin ciple, we could teach ourselves this new theoretical language. If we succeeded, we would no longer need to use expressions from our manifest ways of speaking in reporting, describing, and ex plaining. There is nothing in this characterization of the replace ment of languages or frameworks that refers to the types of entities that will be countenanced or the types of expressions that such an all encompassing theoretical language will employ. Of course, if this piece of philosophic science fiction is to work, we must be convinced that the redefinitions of our present "raw feel" predicates are "in principle acceptable." But once we realize that redefini tion is taking place, there doesn't seem to be any justification for specifying now what must be the character of the expressions in which these redefinitions will be given. In short, using Sellars' own techniques, one might argue for the oppositie conclusion, viz., that there is no a priori reason for claiming that the theoretical counterparts of what we now call "raw feel" predicates must be primitive predicates.36 26 The type of Sellarsian argument for showing that there is no a priori reason for saying now that the neurophysiology of the future must include primitive predicates that correspond to our present "raw feel" predicates has</page><page sequence="18">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 307 Sellars might object that what we have said is simply beside the point and that we are ignoring the really tough problem, i.e., that there is something about "raw feel" predicates that makes it logically impossible to redefine these predicates in terms of more primitive scientific predicates. But Sellars has given us only dark hints about this peculiar characteristic of "raw feels" rather than a clear explication. He tells us that "raw feels" have an "ultimate homogeneity," "immediacy," or "intrinsic character" which makes their reduction impossible. Suppose we grant Sellars' point that there is something about "raw feels" that prevents their "sub stantive reduction." The question then becomes, "can we define, in the framework of neurophysiology, states which are sufficiently analogous in their intrinsic character to sensations to make the identification possible?" (p. 35). We must remember that for Sellars, "sense impressions or raw feels are common sense theoret ical constructs introduced to explain . . . perceptual propositional attitudes."27 Once we understand the role of "sense impressions or raw feels" Sellars believes that the way is clear for understanding how they and their ultimate scientific counterparts can be in trinsically characterized. How are the intrinsic properties of any theoretical construct defined? They are defined by the postulates of the theory. Consequently, "if the theory of impressions were developed in true logistical style, we could say that the intrinsic properties of impressions are 'implicitly defined' by the postulates of the theory, as we can say that the intrinsic properties of sub atomic particles are 'implicitly defined' by the fundamental prin ciples of sub-atomic theory" (p. 192). But something has gone wrong here; Sellars is changing the subject in midstream. We started by locating a feature of "raw feels" that seems to be unique and irreducible, viz., their unique "ultimate homogeneity. " But when exploring the issue of whether there could be a scientific counterpart to these "raw feels," we are told to think of "raw feels" as theoretical constructs whose "in trinsic properties" are implicitly defined by the postulates of the been brilliantly developed by Richard Rorty, "Mind-Body Identity, Privacy, and Categories," The Review of Metaphysics, 19 (1965). 27 "The Identity Approach to the Mind-Body Problem," p. 449.</page><page sequence="19">308 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN common sense theory to which they belong. This suggestion doesn't help at all. To be told that the "fact that impressions are theoretical entities enables us to understand how they can be intrinsically characterized" (p. 192) doesn't bring us any closer to answering the question that started the inquiry. The issue is not whether it makes sense to speak about the intrinsic properties of "raw feels" and about the intrinsic properties of their ultimate scientific counterparts, but whether there can be a scientific counterpart that has intrinsic properties that are sufficiently close to those intrinsic properties that we now ascribe to sensory con sciousness to justify an identification of the two. If this is all that is meant by intrinsic properties of "raw feels," i.e., those properties implicitly defined by the postulates of the theory to which they belong, Sellars' reasons for insisting on the irreducibility of "raw feel" predicates become even more mysterious. In this sense, every theoretical construct has "intrinsic properties." And this would hardly be sufficient to claim that one theoretical construct can't be replaced by more primitive constructs. Once again, Sellars seems to be caught in a dilemma. The more he emphasizes the uniqueness of what we now call "raw feels" the more he appears to be ascribing what we now call "sensory consciousness" to neurophysiological processes, and the more freely he interprets the analogy between what we now call "raw feels" and their ulti mate scientific counterparts, the more he appears to be begging the issue of how the "ultimate homogeneity" of "raw feels" finds a place in the scientific image. So far we have spoken of "raw feels" as if this expression marked off a relatively well defined class of states. But most of our discussion has been about sense impressions, specifically visual sense impressions. This reflects Sellars' own emphasis. How ever, the expression "raw feels" is supposed to be a generic term which includes all sense modalities. "The 'rawness' of 'raw feels' is their nonconceptual character. "28 For Sellars this means that they lack genuine intentionality?the intentionality characteristic of thoughts. The dichotomy between the intentional and the non 28 Ibid., p. 436.</page><page sequence="20">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 309 intentional is the great divide in Sellars' philosophy of mind. And since intentionality is the distinguishing characteristic of what is conceptual, there is a dichotomy between the conceptual and the nonconceptual. There are, of course, uses of the terms "sensa tions" and "feelings" which are intentional and conceptual. But when we use the terms in these ways, we are speaking about propositional attitudes. We have crossed over to the conceptual half of the great divide. What is Sellars doing when he dis tinguishes between sensations and feelings as "raw feels" and as conceptual propositional attitudes? Is he offering us an analysis of sensations and feelings or is he laying down an a priori require ment? Why can't there be intentional phenomena that are non conceptual? Why can't there be grades of intentionality, where only some of these turn out to be conceptual? These questions are not rhetorical, because some recent work in the philosophy of mind within both analytic and phenomenological circles has suggested that something like this is really so.29 The point becomes particularly relevant in an exploration of "feelings" because there seem to be many feelings that have the "ofness" or "aboutness" that philosophers have taken to be the mark of the intentional. And it certainly isn't obvious that this intentionality is either "pseudo-intentionality" or the intentionality characteristic of what is conceptual. It might be objected that this line of criticism is really about the ethics of terminology and not about a substantive issue. For there is nothing in Sellars ' overall position that would stand in the way of a more subtle classification of the grades of intentionality; the important point is carefully to distinguish what is intentional from what is not intentional. Whether we use the term "con ceptual" to denote all these grades of intentionality or only a more restricted range is relatively unimportant as long as we are con 29 For an exploration of the varieties of intentionality with special reference to sensation, feeling, and emotion, see M.

BERNSTEIN sistent. But there is a central substantive issue here. Consider the problems posed by speaking of animal consciousness. Can we ascribe feelings to animals? Prima facie, we can and do. Of course, the evidence for attributing feelings to animals is behav ioral, but this is typically the case with humans too. We speak of animals as experiencing fear and even anxiety. And when we attribute such feelings to animals we don't hesitate to characterize such feelings with the categories of intentionality. But if we accept Sellars' interpretation of intentional episodes as "inner speech" built on the model of overt speech episodes, then a serious problem arises about how we can attribute inner intentional episodes to animals not capable of speech. One may want to argue that ascribing inner intentional episodes to beings not capable of speech (or not yet capable, in the case of human infants) is only "as if" talk. If this is true, then it must be shown. Either it is correct or incorrect to ascribe intentional episodes to animals who are not capable of speech. But in either case, Sellars' philosophic program demands an analysis of the status of "animal consciousness" which he has not provided.30 In the above discussion of "raw feels" we have located an uneasy tension between Sellars' reductive scientific realist tend encies and his desire to "save appearances." The same sort of tension is revealed in his discussion of thoughts or mental acts and their semantical correlates. Sellars' thesis that the intentionality of mental acts can be accounted for in terms of semantical cate gories turns out to have much less "punch" than it originally appears to have. Sellars agrees with the classical view that thought episodes are essentially characterized by the categories of intentionality. He agrees further that these categories cannot be adequately recon structed or translated into a purely extensional language or a physicalistic language. He seems to disagree sharply with the classical view when he claims that "the categories of intentionality 30 For an exploration of related problems of intentionality and animal consciousness, see Charles Taylor, The Explanation of Behavior, pp. 63-71; also Marjorie Grene, "Positionality in the Philosophy of Helmuth Plessner," The Review of Metaphysics, 20 (1966), pp. 250-277, esp. pp. 269-273.</page><page sequence="22">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 311 are nothing more nor less than metalinguistic categories in terms of which we talk epistemically about overt speech," and declares that "this semantical metalanguage can be analyzed in terms which do not presuppose the framework of mental acts."31 Such claims may suggest some sort of reduction of thoughts or mental acts to overt language. But such a suggestion is not only misleading, it is false. According to Sellars, thought is not identical with overt language, and thought cannot be defined in terms of overt lan guage. Overt language expresses thought. We have direct (privileged) access to our thoughts. Sellars even admits that it is "by no means impossible that there be a mature deaf-mute who has 'beliefs and desires' and can 'think about things' . . . though he has learned no language."32 But if Sellars admits all this, one may wonder what really separates him from the classical view?where is the difference that really makes a difference. Presumably the difference hinges on whether "the aboutness of thoughts is to be explained or understood by reference to the categories of semantical discourse about language" or whether the "meaning of language is to be analyzed in terms of the meaning of thoughts." But putting the issue in this way can be very misleading. For the type of analysis that Sellars offers of thoughts or mental acts is what may be called a "horizontal analysis," or "same level analysis" and not a reductive analysis.33 Why does semantical discourse serve as the model for understanding and explaining the "aboutness" of thoughts? Because, according to Sellars, it exhibits the same log ical feature that we ascribe to thoughts and mental acts?inten tionality. "Same level analysis" can frequently be very illuminating, but this sort of analysis is reversible and is relative to what we consider to be problematic. If, for example, we are satisfied that thought really is properly characterized by the categories of intentionality, but are in doubt whether semantical discourse is "intentional," we 31 "Intentionality and the Mental," p. 522. 32 Ibid., p. 528. 38 For a related discussion of what we are calling "horizontal analysis" and its role in recent philosophy see, Richard Rorty, "Pragmatism, Cate gories, and Language," Philosophical Review, 70 (1961), pp. 219 ff.</page><page sequence="23">312 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN could show that semantical discourse is "intentional" by explaining it in terms of thought. This point comes out sharply in the ex change between Chisholm and Sellars. As a defender of the clas sical view, Chisholm argues that the "sentences we use to describe the meanings and uses of words are ordinarily intentional."34 For Chisholm, it is relatively clear and unproblematic that sen tences about such mental acts as beliefs are intentional and he wants to show that the appeal to semantical statements is not a way of avoiding or eliminating the intentional use of language. Sellars would, of course, agree. For he is not contending that semantical discourse provides us with a means for eliminating the intentional use of sentences; it is the model for our concept of intentionality. And it can serve as this model just because it is a unique non reducible form of discourse. But then what is the difference that makes a difference between saying that semantical discourse is intentional and saying that semantical discourse is a unique form of discourse exhibiting those distinctive logical features that are the basis of our concept of intentionality? Think for a moment of a philosopher like Quine or Goodman who is suspicious of all this talk of intentionality?whether applied to thoughts or to semantical discourse. Suppose we wanted to show him that both thought and semantical discourse exhibit the distinctive "aboutness" which we call "intentionality." Is there any argument that we could offer to show the intentionality of one of these "realms" that would not have a counterpart in the other "realm?" In short, Sellars' claim that "the categories of intentionality are nothing more nor less than metalinguistic categories in terms of which we talk episte mically about overt speech" is perfectly compatible with the claim that "the metalinguistic categories in terms of which we talk epistemically about overt speech are nothing more nor less than the categories of intentionality." Sellars ' claim that the intentionality of thoughts can be under stood in terms of the semantical discourse is the first stage of his attempt to show that "there is no barrier in principle to the 34 "Sentences about Believing," Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, II, p. 516.</page><page sequence="24">SELLARS' VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 313 identification of conceptual thinking with neurophysiological process." But the second stage presupposes that we are satisfied with Sellars' analysis of the normative concept of a "role," or more specifically with the analysis of the concept of a "rule." For thoughts are to be conceived of in terms of the roles that items play, and the playing of a role involves the following of rules. The specific issue that we want to explore is Sellars' explication of "rule obeying behavior" and his explanation of how we learn to obey rules. For if Sellars fails here then his attempt to identify conceptual thinking with neurophysiological process collapses. More seriously, the basic distinction between an order of significa tion and a real, natural, physical order?which is the key to Sellars' solution for the problem posed by abstract entities and for clarifying the relation of thought and language to a non-linguistic world of particulars?is in danger of collapsing. And we shall see that difficulties here have repercussions for Sellars' treatment of persons. Unless we can clarify and justify the thesis that one and the same theoretical entity can be the sort of entity that is exhaustively described from a scientific perspective and the sort of entity that can play a role (in the order of signification), it is difficult to see what remains of Sellars' systematic edifice. Let us briefly review how Sellars tackles the problem of ex plicating rule obeying behavior and how we come to learn to obey rules. Sellars has distinguished (i) behavior that merely con forms to rules, (ii) pattern governed behavior, and (iii) rule obeying behavior. The appeal to rule conforming behavior is not sufficient to account for rule obeying behavior?the doing of some thing because of a rule. But the concept of pattern governed behavior is supposed to help us to bridge the gap. We recall that "to learn pattern governed behavior is to become conditioned to arrange perceptive elements into patterns and to form these, in turn, into more complex patterns and sequences of patterns" (p. 327). We can learn to play games, and in particular language games, in this way. But playing a game as a form of pattern governed behavior is not yet to do something because of the rules (in the sense of "because" distinctive of rule obeying behavior). In addition to the language game played as a form of pattern gov erned behavior, we need to introduce a metalanguage game. The</page><page sequence="25">314 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN relation between these two is such that the metalanguage is a rule language "the entry into which is from situations which are posi tions in the game for which it is the rules (OL), and the departure from which is being motivated (by motivating contexts in ML) to make moves in OL" (p. 345). Given such an inclusive game we can now say that "the rules themselves are engaged in the genesis of the moves" (p. 341). The difficult issue in giving an account of rule obeying behav ior is to explain how rules can generate the doing of something and it would seem that Sellars ' elaborate apparatus of games and meta games shows us how this can be explained. But does it? The central issue here is how are we to interpret the transitions be tween the object language and the metalanguage. If these transi tions are simply a matter of being conditioned to respond in certain determinate ways (pattern governed behavior), we haven't come any closer to understanding rule obeying behavior; we have only a more complex form of pattern governed behavior. Suppose we teach an animal a game as a form of pattern governed behavior. We might then complicate the situation by teaching it a new game where "moves" in the original (object) game function as stimuli for the new (meta) game. This may set off a chain of stimulus and response reactions resulting in a new type of move in the original (object) game. But genuine rule obeying behavior in volves making "a series of moves because of the system of moves demanded and permitted by the rules of the game" (p. 325). And this is not the same thing as being conditioned to respond in complex ways on the occasion of certain types of stimuli. What ever plausibility there is to Sellars' elaborate schema depends on assuming that the transitions back and forth from the object lan guage to the metalanguage are not merely conditioned responses, but the full fledged obeying of rules. But this is the concept of rule obeying behavior that the schema was supposed to clarify. The concept of rule obeying behavior has been presupposed rather than explicated. To put the issue in its simplest terms, the success of Sellars' analysis depends on being able to distinguish complex forms of pattern governed behavior (involving object games and</page><page sequence="26">SELLARS7 VISION OF MAN-IN-THE-UNIVERSE, II 315 metagames)35 from genuine rule obeying behavior. And this is precisely what he has failed to show. Is there a way out of this vicious circle? Sellars seems to think that once we understand what is going on, the difficulty dis appears. He might claim that our charge of vicious circularity results from a category mistake. Of course rule obeying behavior is something more than pattern governed behavior. But the "something more" is not something to be described and explained. The something more involved in rule obeying behavior is some thing that is done, not said. Rule obeying behavior is a form of activity and the describing of this activity must not be confused with the doing of it. Nor must we think that there are two sorts of "things" here that need to be reconciled. Rule obeying behav ior is ineffable, not because there is something to say about it that we cannot say, but because it is a form of doing. This line of argument should already be familiar to the reader, because Sellars has already used it in attempting to show how persons can be joined with the scientific image. Indeed, rule obeying behavior is the distinctive form of activity of persons. Furthermore, all paths in Sellars' systematic philosophy lead back to this problem. Even if we limited ourselves to an analysis of thought or sensation, we must eventually face up to the problem of the unity of the person who does the thinking and the sensing. But has Sellars provided us with a solution to the problem posed by rule obeying behavior or does he leave us with a mystery? We can readily accept that there is a categoreal difference between saying and doing, but how helpful is this distinction in under standing rule obeying behavior? Consider how much is packed into this concept of doing. Are all "doings" instances of rule 35 In introducing the concept of pattern governed behavior, Sellars illustrates his meaning with the example of the "dances" of bees. Quite independently, Jonathan Bennett has explored in detail the behavior of bees as a heuristic device for clarifying the concept of rationality. In the course of his discussion he ingeniously invents a "fictional bee" that can play?in Sellars' terms?a game and a metagame. But he shows us that such behavior is not genuine rule obeying behavior but rather a complex form of pattern governed behavior. See Rationality (New York, 1964), pp. 8 ff., especially p. 26.</page><page sequence="27">316 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN obeying behavior? Certainly it would be a blatant confusion if someone thought that describing or saying and doing are the same thing. But this is not the issue here. An explication of the con cept of rule obeying behavior is demanded and Sellars has not provided it. We come finally to the Achilles' heel of Sellars' entire sys tematic edifice?persons. It is the category of persons that is the heart of the manifest image. It is the category of persons that cannot be reconstructed in terms of the fundamental concepts of the scientific image, and must be joined with it to yield a synoptic vision. It is an understanding of the status of persons that is sup posed to shift our focus to doing and acting and thereby dissolve what appears to be a radical ontological bifurcation in the universe. Yet it is here?where the most careful explication is required? that we seem to be left with obfuscation. Precisely how can those multiplicities of theoretical entities that constitute a person use the conceptual framework of persons? And what does such a claim mean? Sellars, who has staunchly defended scientific realism, seems at this point to come very close to an anthropomorphic personalism. For it appears that he is committed to attributing personal agency to (some) multiplicities of scientific entities. Sellars has not given us a solution to the problem of how persons are to be "joined" to the scientific image, nor has he given us the "form of a solution." * * Throughout this study we have tried to present a sympathetic account of what Sellars is "up to" and to press our objections to what appear to be central weaknesses. In this final section I have indicated some of the basic perplexities that remain in one reader who has attempted to find his way about the labyrinths of Sellars' philosophy. My hope is that others will attempt to show what is sound and unsound in Sellars' impressive synoptic vision of man in-the-universe and that this study will encourage others to encounter critically this most demanding, complex, and rewarding philosopher.
