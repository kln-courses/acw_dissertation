      <p>Michael Bryson’s <italic>Visions of the Land</italic> is an ambitious book dissecting the work of seven writers—John Charles Frémont, Richard Byrd, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, John Wesley Powell, Susan Fenimore Cooper, Rachel Carson, and Loren Eiseley—to tease apart connections between the natural sciences and the literature that describes the natural world. The seven subjects vary greatly in vocation, ideology, and historical importance, but they share the gift of eloquent prose (as does Bryson, for that matter), and they prove useful points of entry to evolving American ideas on exploration, scientific management, and the environmental sciences. In the book’s tripartite division, the Western explorer John Charles Frémont and the Antarctic explorer Richard Byrd are contrasted as bookending the historic age of geographic exploration. Historians of science will find valuable Bryson’s analysis of the construction of the American scientist from the earlier icon of the Western explorer. The real jewel among these seven mini literature essays is Bryson’s reexamination of Richard Byrd’s disastrous experiment in scientific solitude in Antarctica. Mentally exhausted by technological breakdowns and physically poisoned by toxic fumes from his generator, Byrd is enslaved and weakened by technology—in contrast to the more successful scientific investigations of Frémont. Here Bryson’s juxtaposition across hemispheres and centuries offers real insight into the limits of technology and the mythological scientist‐explorer.</p>
      <p>In the second section, Bryson’s examination of the scientific management of nature begins with Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s slight utopian satire <italic>Herland</italic> (1915), which describes a carefully managed all‐female society (they breed by parthenogenesis, in case you wondered). Bryson convinces the reader that the obscure Gilman is worth reading, yet the novel seems more interested in puncturing gender stereotypes than in laying out the architecture of a scientifically managed society. <italic>Herland</italic> is juxtaposed to John Wesley Powell’s <italic>Report on the Lands of the Arid Region of the United States</italic> (1878). Donald Worster has already made a strong claim that Powell’s <italic>Report</italic> may be the most important government publication in environmental history. Bryson identifies the essential tension in the <italic>Report</italic> between Powell’s observation of nature as it is and his speculation about controlling nature to make the landscape more amenable to humans. Unexpectedly, the feminist Gilman and the macho explorer Powell are united through their strong belief in scientific management and control over nature.</p>
      <p>The final third of the book opens with Susan Fenimore Cooper’s collection of regional observations, <italic>Rural Hours</italic> (1850). Bryson makes a strong case for placing Cooper within the pantheon of American nature essayists. She most closely resembles John Burroughs in her careful local observations of her homestead and her preference for the edge areas of farm and forest, in contrast to pristine wilderness. Then Bryson inexplicably treats two writers—Rachel Carson and Loren Eiseley—in one chapter, even though both would seem worthy of their own analysis. Carson and Eiseley are portrayed as carrying forward Cooper’s critique of the conquest of nature a century later. Fair enough; but more interesting to the environmental historian is Bryson’s timely reminder of the persistence of and influence wielded by the neglected nature essay in driving conservation thought. In many ways a counter movement to the wilderness lineage of Muir, nature essayists like Burroughs and, later, Carson and Eiseley consistently sought human‐inhabited landscapes and posed the ongoing question of how best to live lightly in such an environment. Bryson’s nuanced analysis of anthropomorphism, scientific instrumentation, and authorial voice in his seven subjects will be of interest to historians of science and technology. Bryson is an engaging guide through these popular and scientific texts, ably laying out 130 years of striving to find a workable relationship between humans and their environment.</p>
