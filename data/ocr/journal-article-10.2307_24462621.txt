<plain_text><page sequence="1">Analogues and Sources for Milton's "Great Task-Master" Samuel S. Stollman All is, if I have grace to use it so, As ever in my great task-Master's eye. ("Sonnet VII") Although Milton's "How Soon Hath Time" is a succinct statement of the Puritan ethic ("The true Puritan stood ever in the great Taskmaster's eye"1) and Milton's Christian Humanist poetic creed, editors of Milton's poetry say little concerning the source for the climactic "great task-Master" image and doc trine. A nominal Hebraic source is adduced by E. A. J. Honigmann in the Egyptian "taskmasters" of Exodus i, 11 ff., with the caution that "Milton bor rowed the word not to complain of a harsh overseer but to suggest that he himself may have a special task, as a poet" (the "eye" image Honigmann asso ciates with Chron. xvi, 9; Psalms xxxii, 18 and xxxix, 15).2 We can strengthen the case for the Exodus referent by adding that, according to the OED, the term "taskmaster" had appeared as early as Tyndale's Bible translation (1530): "And he sette taskemasters over them . . . ." and that there is no further literary record of the term until Milton's "How Soon Hath Time" (1632?). Tyndale's coinage and Milton's ap parently isolated usage reinforce the view that the English Old Testament provided the lexical antece dent for Milton's anthropomorphism. However, the Exodus context of harsh pharaonic men, rather than Milton's just but gracious God, limits "taskemasters" to representing a verbal source only. We may begin with the Biblical term but we are compelled to look elsewhere for Milton's creed in "Sonnet VII." A New Testament derivation for Milton's "task Master" (suggested by the letter accompanying Mil ton's transcription of the sonnet in the Trinity College MS) is given by J. B. Leishman: "How characteristi cally Miltonic is the conception of Christ as the great Task-Master, the Master of the Vineyard . . . While the Parable of the Vineyard (Matthew xx, 1-16) is contextually relevant to Milton's "Sonnet VII," and is alluded to by Milton himself in the Trinity cor respondence, Leishman's identification of "the great Task-Master" as "the Master of the Vineyard" and Christ is challenged by Milton's much later "Sonnet XIX," "When I Consider How My Light Is Spent" (1655), where Milton's "task-Master" clearly is God: "'Doth God exact day-labor, light denied,'/I fondly ask." Who, then is the "great task-Master"? And we must still determine the doctrinal basis of the "task." Orthodox Pauline theology clearly stresses "justifica tion by faith" and not by "works." It is a common place that the New Testament has served many de nominations and interpretations. Where, then, do we find the tenet of the "task" or "works"? And where in Christian teaching do we find the "task-Master" concept applied to poetry as a religious calling? Leish man's learned comments on "Sonnet VII"—in which he cites Campbell's early association of Pindar's fourth Nemean Ode (11.68-70); perceives Christ as "the Master of the Vineyard, almost, one might say, as a kind of King Arthur"; and notes "how closely the Greek, especially the Platonic, conception of vir tue and the chivalrous allegiance and romantic war fare of Spenser and medieval legend combine with Milton's conception of the true wayfaring Christian"; and to which he adds the possibility of Milton's allusion to Cowley's Poetical Blossoms — suggest the complexity and the ambiguity of the source or sources.3 "Sonnet VII" is not simply a New Testament adum bration. Let us at the start recall—or recognize—that Milton's theology is a theology of works. Milton's "task-Master" of "Sonnet VII" is an early concep tualization of Milton's later formulation of that doc trine. What begins as the plaint of the young poet regarding his tardy maturation in his poetic calling grows into a lifelong sensitivity and zeal for the task 27</page><page sequence="2">or tasks of the Christian, given the graces and talents with which he has been endowed, and challenged by the urgency to serve and glorify God. For Milton, poetry was always his foremost vocation but never his only task. The "task-Master" of poetic calling is Milton's Great Taskmaster of the Reformation and the Renaissance. In Reason of Church-Government (1642) Milton castigated himself for not applying his God-given talents to God's service: "Thou hadst the diligence, the parts, the language of a man, if a vain subject were to be adorn'd or beautifi'd, but when the cause of God and his Church was to be pleaded, for which purpose that tongue was given thee which thou hast, God listen'd if he could heare thy voice among his zealous servants [my italics], but thou wert domb as a beast . . . ."4 Milton's preoccupation with poetry, some ten years earlier, in "Sonnet VII," had now been superseded by another, more urgent calling. His gifts of speech and poetic expression had not yet been employed in "the cause of God." "God listen'd": the Divine Taskmaster was ever-present and ever-urgent. Similarly, when Milton outlined the goals of his Humanistic curriculum (1644), he incorporated the Puritan ethic—and Humanist creed — in his emphasis on works: "I call therefore a com pleate and generous Education that which fits a man to perform [my italics] justly, skilfully, and magnanimously all the offices both private and pub like of peace and war." Knowledge, combined with "the heavenly grace of faith," leads to virtue, Milton says; and the virtuous life is the "active" life.5 Mil ton's Humanist position in Of Education finds its theological statement in Christian Doctrine (1640 73?): "Faith has its own works, which may be dif ferent from the works of the law. We are justified therefore by faith, but by a living, not a dead faith; and that faith alone which acts [my italics] is counted living; James ii. 17, 20, 26. Hence we are justified by faith without the works of the law, but not with out the works of faith; inasmuch as a living and true faith cannot consist without works, though these latter may differ from the works of the written law."6 What is Milton's source for the theology of works? The apostle James cites Abraham and Rahab as exemplars of works. Milton adds Phineas and his zealous act. It is not only Old Testament figures who serve ^s models for James and Milton but also the Mosaic Law itself, which, for Milton, is "internalized" and "spiritualized" for the Christian. While Milton regarded the Law as completely abrogated as an imposed Code, he considered the Law to be relevant and applicable to the Christian in a special sense. For Milton there is "a twofold Scripture; one external, which is the written word, and the other internal, which is the Holy Spirit, written in the hearts of believers .. . ,"7 The Written Law of the Jews has not only been transformed for the Christian but is also transmitted to the Christian by a New Covenant, again by analogy with the Covenant of Israel. In Areopagitica (1644), to cite one instance, Milton declaims: "Why else was this Nation [England] chos'n before any other, that out of her as out of Sion should be proclam'd and sounded forth the first tidings and trumpet of Reformation to all Europ." And "What wants there to such a towardly and pregnant soile, but wise and faithfull labourers [my italics], to make a knowing people, a Nation of Prophets, of Sages, and of Worthies."8 With very strong indications of allusions to the Vineyard parable applying to the People of Israel (Isaiah v, 7 ff.; Jeremiah ii, 21; Psalms lxxx, 9-20; and Song of Songs viii, 11-12), particu larly in the context here of "Sion" and the Chosen People, Milton's vision of England's role is that assigned by the Hebrew Scriptures to the People of Israel. "Faith" and "works" are joined in the Refor mation nationalist manifesto as they are in the Hu manistic curriculum. The Hebraic elements of Mil ton's worldview, despite their modification and trans mutation, are clear. The "task-Master" of "Sonnet VII" originates in the Old Testament. Leishman's New Testament analogue or source requires the Hebraic principle of works to give substance to Milton's concept of faith. The Law and the Covenant provide the link between the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. But we have yet to justify Milton's view of poetry as a Christian task. Our initial inquiries lead us back to Milton's Classical learning — themes and models. The Greek and Roman theorists had en dowed poetry and the poet with divine attributes. Poetry was divine in origin and was the manifestation in the poet of furor or divine rapture; the poet was a vates sacer but without the religious dimension of God's faithful servant.9 In the early synthesis of Christianity and Humanism in the literary theory of the sixteenth century, notably in Sidney's An Apology for Poetry, we find the abjuration of the "divine frenzy" inspirational concept in favor of the "Puritan" idea "that making poetry is, essentially, the discipline of an enlightened intellect, which seeks ... to recover something of the true and perfect knowledge lost since 'the first accursed Fall'," while the end of poetry, as with the Classical writers, re mained "virtuous action": "For, as Aristotle saith, it is not Gnosis but Praxis must be the fruit."10 De spite the Puritans' suspicion of poetry and the gradual secularization of the poetic vocation, Milton restored something of the "divine fury" to poetry (without compromising "Reason"), maintained the concept of 28</page><page sequence="3">"virtuous action," and added the dimension of re ligious calling and task to his conception of his major poetic undertaking. The spark for the poetic flame came from the Hebrew altar: "The existence of the Hebrew Scrip tures ... in the particular setting of seventeenth century protestantism," writes Basil Willey, "must be accounted, together with the idea of the heroic poem, as the cause which made possible a great serious poem at just the period when poetry was coming to be thought of as elegant and agreeable rather than 'true.' Poetry . . . might be an affront to the common sense . . . ; but as Prophecy it was still admissible."11 The Classical "divine fury" Milton found (as Sidney in the Psalms) in the Hebrew Proph ets: "His word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, I was weary with forbearing, and could not stay" (Milton's paraphrase of Jeremiah xx, 9). For Milton a common bond of divine inspira tion joined Tiresias and Jeremiah, Homer and David — the Muses and Moses.12 Hebrew song was the model for Greece and the sanction for the poetic task: "Greece from us [the Jews]," Milton has Jesus say, "these Arts deriv'd;/Ill imitated" (Paradise Re gained, IV, 337-8). The "frequent songs" of "the law and prophets," Milton found "over all the kinds of Lyrick poesy, to be incomparable."13 Classical poetry reflected the perfect attainment of the Hebrew Scrip tures; and the Hebrew songs, in turn, were "Chris tianized" into a Christian Humanist poetic creed. Milton's "unified sensibility" is of a unique Christian Humanist sort: A continuum of doctrine and a con tinuity of interpretation syncretize the Classical, the Hebrew, and the Christian traditions—and their dif ferences seemingly disappear. Whatever Milton's cultural and intellectual hermeneutics—Reason, the Law of Nature, the Holy Spirit—applied by Neopla tonic allegoria, typology, myth, or rationalism—the Classical was subsumed by the Hebraic and the Hebraic then became—or "continued" as—the con fluence of the Christian.14 Milton's methodology need not detain us here. What we must note, however, is the unique synthesis produced by the sensibility which finds continuity and fusion in disparate cul tures and traditions. The Hebraic elements of Mil ton's worldview are the fulcrum and catalyst of his intellectual process. Milton's Hebraism helped bridge the gulf between Classical Humanism and Reforma tion Christianity. With all the signposts pointing to the Hebrew Bible for the Scriptural sanction for the "task," the Puritan ethic, Humanist activism, and the divinity of song, the following "taskmaster" analogue is of special significance. A remarkable similarity of terms and tenets obtains between Milton's "great task Master" and the "taskmaster" of a homiletic work of the Rabbis, the short tractate A both, which was available in England as early as the sixteenth century in a Latin rendition by Paulus Fagius (1504-49), who was a Hebrew reader at Cambridge and who was lauded by Milton for his learning.15 The availability of the Latin version of The Ethics of the Fathers, in conjunction with Milton's competence in Hebrew, his knowledge of Biblical commentary, and his many allusions to the Talmud and the Rabbis validate the careful consideration of the following Rabbinic teachings as being related—directly or indirectly—to Milton's image and creed in "Sonnet VII"—as ana logue, source, or key: 1. Consider three things and thou wilt not fall into the hands of transgression: know what is above thee—a seeing eye [my italics, here and following] and a hearing ear and all thy deeds written in a book. 14. Rabbi Eleazar said: Be alert to study the Law [the Torah: the Written and Oral Law] and know before whom thou toilest and who is thy taskmaster who shall pay thee the reward of thy labour. 15. Rabbi Tarfon said: The day is short and the task is great and the labourers are idle and the master of the house [God] is urgent. 16. He used to say: It is not thy part to finish the task, yet thou art not free to desist from it. If thou hast studied much in the Law much reward will be given thee, and faithful is thy taskmaster who shall pay thee the reward of thy labour. (A both II) 16. All is foreseen, but freedom of choice is given, and the world is judged by grace [Hebrew: tuv, literally, 'goodness'], yet all is according to the excess of works [Ed.: "that be good or evil"]. (Aboth III)16 The consanguinity of terms, themes, and even teachings of the Rabbis in Aboth and of Milton in "Sonnet VII" (and throughout his works), in de lineating man's vocation, is most striking. Both Mil ton and the Rabbis are seized with the fleetingness of time, the conceptualization of God as Taskmaster and the urgency of man's task, moral freedom, man's initiative and responsibility, and a gracious God who accepts man's shortcomings as long as he has done his utmost. For Milton, the task in "Sonnet VII" is the calling of poetry, with intimations of other tasks and works in the course of time. For the Rabbis, man's primary task is the study of the Law (Milton's "knowledge"?) and the observance of its Commandments ("justifica 29</page><page sequence="4">tion by works"). Both the Rabbis and Milton are keenly conscious of man's limitations: the Rabbis, in stressing the infinitude of the Torah; Milton, in dwelling upon the finitude of man. Both Milton and the Rabbis invoke God's grace for aid in the fulfilment of man's task. For Milton, grace is associated with "the Protestant view that works without faith and grace are valueless."17 For the Rabbis, grace is God's attribute of goodness with which He judges the world. (While "faith" is not discussed here in the Aboth passage cited, faith in God and His Torah is insep arable, in normative Judaism, from the observance of the Law—"works." The concept of "faith" is a commonplace in the Hebrew Scriptures, beginning with Abraham and continuing through the Com mandments concerning faith, given to Israel. Aboth itself stresses the concept of faith in each of its six chapters.) The Rabbis posit God's foreknowledge as well as man's freedom in determining the moral course of his life. Milton, while not stressing such a combination here, makes foreknowledge and free dom—the so-called "Arminian" view—central tenets in Christian Doctrine and Paradise Lost.18 Milton visualizes the fruition of his talents as an "inward ripenes," which "is . . . ever in . . . [the] great task Master's eye";19 the divine task is coeval with life— as the Rabbis also teach. But, for Milton, the calling emerges from within—as an "inward ripenes"—the "internal Scripture"; for the Rabbis, the task is im posed from without, by the revealed Written Law. Both for Milton and the Rabbis, the task is necessary to faith; performance, "a living faith," acts and deeds are necessary. Both Aboth and "Sonnet VII" visualize the Taskmaster in a "personal" relationship to man: one is ever under God's "eye." The ideological affinity of Milton and the Rabbis is epitomized in the shared concepts of man's divine task and of God the Task master. While the Rabbis do not apotheosize poetry —in this context—the Hebrew Scriptures are replete with song and psalm, praise and prophecy. Shirah, Scrip tural song (e.g., Moses and Israel at the Red Sea, Moses' "Farewell Song," "the Song of Deborah," David's songs of victory and salvation, etc.), and Zimrah, the Psalmist's praise, are recognized by the Rabbis as a special "genre," incorporated and imi tated in the Jewish liturgy and recited and augmented at the Festival and Sabbath table, but without the aesthetic theorizing that is the cultural contribu tion of the Greeks; instead, religious song, the only kind that is esteemed by the Rabbis, is regarded as holy and divinely inspired. When we remove the Classical components of Milton's poetic theory and practice, we find a Hebraic common denominator for Milton's poetic theory and practice and the Rab bis' canonization of Biblical song. The parallel imagery of Aboth and "Sonnet VII" and the affinity of the tenets and teachings (in the two citations under study, and in the wider considera tion of Rabbinic tradition and Milton's life long thought and practice) strongly suggest—if not Milton's direct source, that is, Aboth—the common origin of the two documents—the Hebrew Scrip tures. A both supplies in one text and context that which neither the Exodus "taskemasters," the New Testament "Master of the Vineyard," the Classical Phaedrus, nor the Neoclassical An Apology for Poet ry offers alone. What are the possibilities then that Aboth is actually Milton's source? Giving credence to such a hypothesis are Milton's many citations from the Talmud and references to the Rabbis (there are more than thirty allusions to the Rabbis in Milton's prose); the relative simplicity of the Mishnaic Hebrew of Aboth (stylistically and idiomatically simpler than many passages of the Bible and certainly easier reading for Milton than the Talmud which is written basically in Aramaic—Milton's "Chaldee"); the pop ularity and the authoritativeness of The Ethics of the Fathers as a quintessential statement of Jewish religious thought; and, of course, the Latin transla tion of Fagius. On the other hand, militating against the likeli hood of Milton's borrowing from the Rabbis is Mil ton's unequivocal Christian profession and theology — however independent, on the one hand, and his well-known scorn for the Rabbis and Judaism as a whole, on the other.20 And yet, Milton's Christian doctrine is not the simple antithesis of Judaism (al though such an antithesis is a recurrent motif in his writing);21 Milton's doctrine is a blend or composite of certain "Hebraic" elements and themes (as dis tinguished from "Judaic") and New Testament teach ings thus modified.22 Even if Milton's suspicion of the Rabbis and contempt for Judaism are regarded as a block to his consideration of the Rabbinic tradition in any part, it is a commonplace that Milton was not averse to citing the Rabbis and those whom he deemed "hairsplitters" when he required prooftexts or authority for his unorthodox views.23 In the light of the arguments pro and con we cannot rule Aboth out, nor can we confirm it, as Milton's focal source for "Sonnet VII", nor, indeed, even as among his Rabbinic readings. But we can draw three conclusions: First, Aboth incorporates in one context what none of the other traditions provides alone—whether the Classical or the Christian. Second, Milton's "task-Master" emerges from the same constellation of Hebraic sources that inspired the Rabbinic parables—and, 30</page><page sequence="5">for that matter, the New Testament "Master of the Vineyard."24 Third, while the Scriptures are the pri mary and even sole source for Milton's religious views (and therefore his ideology) as outlined in Christian Doctrine, the Hebrew Bible is the decisive factor in determining the orientation of that doctrine. While Milton, the seventeenth-century Christian Humanist, eclecticized and combined Classical, He braic, and Christian traditions, the Rabbis drew their philosophy from one source only—the Hebrew Scrip tures (and the Oral Tradition). A both not only brings together the basic elements of "Sonnet VII" but in dicates their origin, regardless of "why" and "how" Milton reached almost similar conclusions. The Puri tan ethic is an offshoot of the Hebraic ethic. Aboth demonstrates this. If the Mishnah is not Milton's source, it is nevertheless the most striking and in clusive analogue to date; and more than this, it sup plies a key to the weight of the Hebraic factor in Milton's thought. "Sonnet VII" is a poetic microcosm of Milton's theological macrocosm. If Milton's theol ogy "is indeed a theology of Works," as Professor Harold Fisch demonstrates, and a "crossing of the Renaissance faith in Man with the Reformation ex perience of God," the conjunction of "Sonnet VII" and Aboth corroborates that "the specific environ ment of this combination is Hebraic."25 However, for the Rabbis, the task and the Task master are the "literal" conceptualizations of the Scriptural Commandment "to meditate in the Law both day and night," the bindingness of the Law, and the role of the Lawgiver. For Milton, the task and the "task-Master" are metaphors, concretizing the calling that emerges from the "inward ripenes" of "Sonnet VII" and the role of the Holy Spirit acti vating the "internal Scripture" of Christian Doc trine. Despite their totally different approaches to the Law, Milton and the Rabbis (via the Hebrew Scriptures) concur in the conception of the holy life as an active response to the divine calling. Whether they conceived of the task as emanating from an "internal" Law (as Milton does) or from an "external" Law (Milton's characterization of the Mosaic Law), they agree on the inseparability of works and faith (although works and faith have different connota tions for Jew and Christian —theologically speaking). Milton's "task-Master"-doctrine then is ultimately Hebraic, rather than orthodox Christian belief. The identification of "task-Master" as a Hebraism within Milton's otherwise Christian confession is not an anomaly —for Milton (or the Puritans). The unique Renaissance intellect and temperament that labored to assimilate and syncretize the imagery and themes of Classicism with the vocabulary and dogma of Christianity could and did, with even less dif ficulty, synthesize the "Hebraic elements" of the Old Testament and the whole of the New Testament in a Scriptural continuum that is, in fact, the hall mark of the Puritan's approach to the Scriptures. Milton Hebraized the New Testament and Chris tianized the heroes and truths of the Hebrew Bible — as he Christianized the Classical and Classicized the Christian. The result is the unique Christian Humanist worldview and literary climax of the Ren aissance in England. University of Windsor NOTES 'H. G.

The key phrase, the Hebrew baal melachah, which is translated by Danby as "taskmaster," is not the same as the Hebrew sarei missim of Exodus, translated by Tyndale also as "taskemasters." Baal literally means "master"; and melachah literally means "work" and, especially in Rabbinic usage, work of a constructive nature (as well as "vocation" or "trade"). On the other hand, sar (singular, and sarei — genitive plural) of Exodus signifies "prince" or "officer" (as well as "overseer") rather than "master," whereas missim (in the plural form incidentally) of Exodus denotes "forced labors" or "taxes." While, then, in a literal translation of Aboth we could render baal melachah as "master of the work" (or "master of the vocation"), Danby's "taskmaster" is a closer rendition of the Mishnaic baal melachah than Tyndale's "taskemasters" is of the sarei missim of Exodus.

The reader's attention is called to Milton's "detestation" of Judaism and his associa tion of bondage with Judaism, on the one hand; and his apotheosis of Hebrew song and certain aspects of the Law and the Covenant, which are not stig matized as "Judaic" but regarded as applying to the Christian, although "Hebraic" in origin, on the other.

There is, further, a curious parallel be tween the "Lord of the harvest" and "the harvest is plentiful but the labourers are few" (Matthew ix, 37-38 and Luke x, 2) and the Rabbinic parables of Aboth. It is a commonplace that many of the themes and parables of the New Testament are related to the Oral Tradition and parabolic style of the Rabbis. For a discussion of New Testament borrowings from the Rabbis, see A Rabbinic Anthology, C. G. Monte fiore and H. Loewe, eds. (New York: Meridian, n. d.). 25Jerusalem and Albion (New York, 1964), p. 122. Fisch's work is the most comprehensive treatment of the "Hebraic factor" in Milton's thought, as well as in other seventeenth-century English writers. I have undoubtedly restated, modified, or differed with, Fisch's analysis, in one or two points, and I wish to acknowledge any possible indebtedness. However, "Sonnet VII" and Aboth are not touched upon by Professor Fisch. 32</page></plain_text>
