<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLY SEMITE BY EDWARD DAY San Antonio, Texas The question "What kind of man was the early Semite?" can find at the best but a tentative answer because the data at our disposal are so meager. Not until centuries had passed and the various branches of the Semitic stock had lived somewhat apart long enough to develop individualistic traits and customs, and even in some re- gions to become mixed with other peoples, did they leave us sufficient material to warrant our reaching assured conclusions in our study of their life. In our attempt here we are fortunate in having in the old J and E narratives of the Hexateuch and Judges considerable legend- ary material that carries us back much farther than the more artificial imaginative patriarchal stories of Genesis. And while we have but little data which take us back to the early time among the Arabs we find that their comparative isolation rendered it possible for them to preserve unchanged many features of their primitive life. Then too we have had given us during the last century a mass of material from ancient Mesopotamia which is being continually augmented by pres- ent-day discovered tablets, steles, and cylinders, much of which has already been deciphered by our scholars. Our only hesitancy in not making larger use than we do of these finds grows out of the fact that old as this material is it has to do with an advanced stage of culture and the cognate fact that these people seem to have been intermixed to some extent with non-Semitic peoples. Nevertheless so much older is a large part of it that often we are moved to start with it in our study and then check up as we come down into early Hebrew and other early sources. It is just here that those interested in the study of the early life of the Semites find themselves far more favorably circumstanced than were scholars of but a few decades ago. It is this increase of rich material which goes a long way in excusing such an attempt as is here undertaken.' 1 See S. A. Cook's note in the new edition of Smith's Religion of the Semites, p. 497, "Whereas Robertson Smith, with Wellhausen, Stade, and others, took the relatively simple conditions of Arabia for their starting-point, scholars now give more prominence to the abundant evidence for the antiquity and richness of the civilization of the old Mesopotamian lands." 150</page><page sequence="2">THE EARLY SEMITE 151 The early Semite was not a dreamer or visionary. He knew him- self to be a physical being living in a real world and consequently en- deavored to make the most of his earthly life. So intensely did he live that like the ancient Greek he was able to ignore largely the fact that death was, when it came his way, to let him down into a dreary, shadowy existence in the nether world. In the emphasis which the Sem- ites put upon the material they resembled the west Aryans rather than the east who pushed down into India and lost in the tropics their original character centuries before the Christian Era. And it is pre- sumable that somewhere in Central Asia the Semites had their original seat where like the early Aryans they were subjected to extremes of climate and were forced to resist marauding neighbors; though it was from Arabia that they seem to have migrated prior to the beginnings of their authentic annals. In this paper we study the early Semite as a man, endeavoring to grasp a reasonable conception of himself, of his body and more especially of his head and inwards and their organs. But before pass- ing on to dwell upon his thought of his body and its parts we should notice that in common with primitive man he conceived of his breath or spirit as an important though mysterious part of his real self. The Hebrew word nephesh, used for "spirit," "soul," or "self," is found in the early J narratives, as in Gen. 2:7 where we read that Yahweh puffed into the man's nostrils the neshamah ("breath") of life and he became a nephesh ("a living being"). Here nephesh is used not for "spirit," as it often is, but for the self, the man, a living being.' It has its cognates in other Semitic tongues.2 Neshamah is the common Hebrew term for "breath," though it is sometimes found in the late literature for "spirit." Nephesh as life is found in such passages as Exod. 21:23 (J), "life for life," and for soul or spirit in such passages as "and it came to pass when her spirit was going forth" (Gen. 35:18 [E]). It was more frequently used in this way than was neshamah. 1 See Skinner, Genesis, pp. 56 f. 2 The Hebrew is Wj)1 , its Arabic cognate is ;U " it has its cognates in all Semitic tongues. In the E thiopic where it appears as soul or person it is also used for tombstone or monument. Originally it seems to have been quite generally used of the breath; but it is not to be supposed that early man had our physiological conception of breathing, for as he put up his hand and felt his breath leaving and returning he must have thought it to be in some mysterious way his spirit passing out and returning (see Staples, "The 'Soul' in the Old Testament," AJSL, XLIV, No. 3 11928]).</page><page sequence="3">152 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Even more common was this use of the Hebrew rua4, the term for "wind," common to other Semitic tongues. In the Assyrian nephish or nepiStu was used for "breath," "life," and "soul." The verbal root having the force of "to widen one's self, one's inwards," "to be ample, abundant" may suggest that the ancient Babylonians practiced deep breathing. In the Code of Hammurabi the noun is the common term for "life." In the Arabic nephesh is used of "the breath whereby one lives," or as more in harmony with the later thought of the Semites, "the vital principle or soul." While the Hebrew lags little if any behind other Semitic tongues in locating the emotions and passions in the inwards it unmistakably alludes now and then to the nephesh as their seat. Where it not for some of these passages, which have this word as commonly used in the early time, we might regard such statements as anticipations of modern psychology; but their early connotation and their want of precision forbid our making overmuch of them as a contribution to present-day thought.' Then, too, before passing on to consider the early Semite's con- ception of his body we should note that like primitive man generally he made much of his shadow as something which while it seemed mysterious was nevertheless thought to be a real part of himself which he could not while living get along without. We have been reminded by S. A. Cook that "any part of the body that was regarded as vital, indeed anything that seemed to be vitally connected with a man [e.g., his name or shadow], could be treated as an integral part of him, part of his personality in fact."2 And C. H. Toy has told us that "an accompaniment of the body that attracted the attention of early man was the shadow, for which the science of that day, unacquainted with optical laws, could account only on the supposition that it was a double of the man, another self, a something belonging in the same category with the breath-soul, though usually distinguished from it. The shadow was regarded as a sort of independent objective being which might be seized and destroyed."3 The early Semites seem to have been as much impressed by their shadow and the shadow of men and natural objects as were other peoples. To them they were, as they II Sam. 2:16 (E); Gen. 34:3 (J). 2 See note in Smith op. cit.

The Hebrew word for "shadow" which had its cognates in other Semitic tongues' is not found in the Old Testament of the shadow of any other individual than Yahweh himself and as used of him it ap- pears usually in the poetry of the late time with but the slightest anthropomorphic coloring, as in Ps. 91:1 where occurs the phrase "in the shadow of the Almighty," and as in Ps. 17:8 where the psalmist exclaims, "Hide me in the shadow of thy wings."2 In the Assyrian the noun is employed in the Code by Hammurabi of himself as the shade or protector of the people of Sumer and Akkad and also of himself as the divine protector of the land.3 An old and significant passage is found in the Hebrew of Num. 14:9 where the people as they stand in the south country unwilling to move north and take possession of Canaan are exhorted not to be afraid of the people of the land because "their shade [defense] is removed from over them and Yahweh is with us." The thought is that the Canaanites are defense- less because they are no longer overshadowed by their gods.4 In an early narrative we read of the shadow of a thorn bush.5 To Jotham who addresses the Shechemites allegorically Abimelech who wishes to rule them as their king is their box-thorn shrub who wants them to come under his shade or protection, a poor substitute for their father Gideon who refuses the honor and its accompanying burden. Those who among the early Semites accepted the hospitality which in accord with custom was so graciously extended to them were said to put themselves under the shadow of a friendly roof, in consequence of which they were thought to be safe. Lot felt bound to protect the 1' is from the verb 2, "to be or grow dark." The Arabic noun 1 is from , "to shade," to cover," "to protect." So the Assyrian qillu which is from qaldlu. Other Semitic tongues have the word in the same sense, though the Sabaean noun is used for "ceiling" or "roof." 2 Briggs thought that in these and other like passages in the Psalms the writer had in mind the overshadowing wings of the cherubim of the Holy Place (Psalms, I, 130; II, 279). Not so Cheyne and others. 3 Col. 40:46; Col. 2:48 f. (Harper's volume). 4 See Gray, Numbers, pp. 153 f. Gray takes exception to the thought that the narrator supposed that the loss of the shadow meant the loss of vitality and the extreme peril in- volved in such loss. He thinks very reasonably that the word is used figuratively as in the Psalms and Isaiah. 5 Judg. 9:15 (E); see Moore, Judges, pp. 248 f.</page><page sequence="5">154 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES strangers who, to use his own words, "have come under the shadow of my roof," even though in doing so he might have to give up his daughters into the hands of the lewd rabble outside his door. In Gen. 19:1 ff. (J) we have a picture of settled life; but apparently in the nomadic days of Israel, if we may hark back from what we know of life in Arabia during the last hundred years, a guest under the shadow of a clansman's tent felt he was secure, that virtually he was the guest of the entire clan to which his host belonged, all the members of which were virtually pledged to protect him.' Shadows which were thus conceived of as covering, sheltering, and protecting seem at times to have been thought possessed of power to heal.2 Our one biblical evidence of this is late but apparently it was in accord with primitive thought as truly as the thought that at times under certain circumstances a shadow might be baleful. The thought that a shadow might be maleficent may explain why in the late time Hebrews alluded, as did the Assyrians and the Arabs earlier, to "deep shadows" or "death-shadows."3 Primitive man was ever in fear, as savage man is today, of losing his shadow; and consequently was alert as he walked along a tropical stream or through a forest path lest some beast seize it. We find no trace of this in Semitic thought, though such fear must have haunted the early Semite. Presumably to him also as to other primitive men a ghost or spirit was a person who had lost his shadow; but of this we find no trace. To the Semites as to other early peoples some mysterious occult significance was supposed to be possessed by one's name. "To primi- tive man the name is the expression of the personality.'"4 Hence to destroy one's name was equivalent to extirpating his personality. In the Annals of Sennacherib Tukulti Urta, son of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, records on a seal, "Who blots out my written name, may Assur and Adad destroy his name and his land."5 Here and in many similar records we have the thought that one's name and person were so entirely one that they cannot be separated without loss.

In a legend of "extreme antiquity" having to do with Jacob's supposed experience at Peniel we are told that the mysterious stranger who wrestled with him through the night withheld his name though the nomad sheik sought it. Skinner sug- gests that "this is probably an older variant of 28 f., belonging to a primitive phase of thought, where he who possesses the true name of a god can dispose of the power of its bearer."' We should note what the wife of Nabal had to say of her worthless husband, "As his name so is he: 'Reckless' is his name and recklessness abides with him." Did she feel that bearing the name he bore he could not be a different man? The Semitic word for "name" should not be overlooked.2 The Assyrian Sumu like its Hebrew cognate was used for one's reputation as well as "name."3 It occurs frequently in the Code as where Ham- murabi prays that his name may be remembered, one of few prayers of his that bids fair to be answered.4 THE BODY The early Semite knew himself as an azkar, a "male." The term in some Semitic tongues, and perchance in all originally, was used for the male organs of generation of men and even of beasts. As used for man it has been thought to designate him as the sex of distinction as compared with woman who among the early Semites was lightly es- teemed as she still is among the Arabs.5 The Assyrian zikaru, pri- marily used for the penis or genital organs, was employed to designate the male and man as was the Arabic cognate. In the Code man is so designated, as where we read of a wife who couches with another man 1 Gen. 32:24-29 (J); Genesis, p. 410. 2 I Sam. 25:25 (J). * The Hebrew 00 has its cognate in most Semitic tongues. Like the Assyrian gumu it has no known root; while the Arabic , for "sign," "name," is from a verb signifying "to be high," "conspicuous." 4 40:94; cf. what he says of the effacing of his name (42:33). 5 Lane, Arabic-English Lexicon, pp. 970; cf. Doughty, op. cit., II, 141. Such deriva- tion of the word is open to question. While the thought of "1' as "the piercer" is not in favor among scholars the fact that jj=P as "the pierced" for the female, from tp:, should not be overlooked. It is admitted that the relation of 'ZT, "male," to the verb 1ZT, "to name," "to mention," "to remember," is obscure. The fact that the Arabic Sis used for a cutting or sharp sword should not be overlooked. May not the Semitic verb originally have had the sense, as has been suggested, of "to be sharp," "to cut"? The earliest memorials were graved in clay and in stone; and in some of the Semitic tongues the noun derived from this verb was used for "a monument," i.e., "an engraved memorial" (see Lane, pp. 968 ff.).</page><page sequence="7">156 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES in place of her husband and where mention is made of a betrothed woman who has not known man.' The fact that this is a common Semitic word should not be over- looked, for it takes us back into early Semitic life. While there is always danger that we may make too much of the wide use of common words in the Semitic tongues because we cannot always be sure that they take us back to the old life which they as nomads shared as one people, if indeed they once so lived, we should ever bear in mind the words of Robertson Smith, "The Semitic tongues are so much alike that their affinity is recognized even by untrained observers; and mod- ern science has little difficulty in tracing them back to a simple primi- tive speech."2 We are bound to notice the more common words for man which were in use among the early Semites for they are suggestive of man's thought of himself. In the old J narrative of Genesis Yahweh is said to have molded man out of clay, or literally "out of the dust of the ground"-a statement which is somewhat puzzling if we do not stop to reflect that there is no mention of the blood of the Creator as mixed with the dust as in the supposed Babylonian original.3 Here the com- mon word for man, 'adam, found as a cognate in the same or a kindred sense in other Semitic tongues, appears. In the Assyrian admu was used for "boy," "youth," and also for the young of birds. The root of the Hebrew word may have been a verb signifiying "to be red, brown, tawny," as presumably it was in the Arabic and the Assyrian; but this etymology of the noun is questioned. In the Genesis narra- tive it is used of the first man but presumably it was not originally intended to be taken as a proper name. Even more common as a term for man in the Hebrew than 'adam is 'ish, which also has its cognates in most Semitic tongues; but its derivation is so dubious as to add little to our knowledge of early Semitic man's thought of himself.4 Common as was the use of 'adam in the Hebrew, 'ish was far oftener used. 1 ?? 129 and 130. 2 Rel.

If rj1: is the original form of OIN, then its derivation must have been from ":, "to be weak," "to be sick," or better per- chance from 1t:, a verb meaning "to be sociable," "friendly"; for the Arabic has in S( such a verb. The Assyrian ni'u for "people," "mankind," apparently is a cognate of wJj$; but its derivation is in doubt.</page><page sequence="8">THE EARLY SEMITE 157 Important as was the nephesh in his thought the early Semite was not unaware of the fact that he was possessed of a body. Indeed we may say that the term nephesh was itself often so broadly used as to embrace the body in its connotation. Yet strange as it must seem the Semites had no one common word for the body. The Assyrians had the word pegru for both the living and the dead body. It is found in the Code where we read of a woman whose husband does not for some reason return home, "She shall protect her pegru.[body]," i.e., "keep herself pure."' The cognate of this Assyrian word does not appear in the Arabic; it is found in the Hebrew but only for a dead body, never for a living.2 Words having to do with parts of the body were made in common speech to serve for the whole body. Among the Hebrews their words for the bones and flesh were often so employed. According to Gen. 2:23 (J), the man, when the woman who had been built up out of a piece taken from his side was presented to him, exclaimed, as though he intuitively sensed her origin, "This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh." The phrase is a common one among the early Hebrews; and among them as a term was equivalent to the whole body.3 The Hebrew word for "bone" is common to Semitic tongues and as used reveals that to the Hebrews the bones were regarded as of major importance. In harmony with the early thought of the bones is a line in Job 20:11 which mentions the bones as the seat of vigor, "His bones are full of his youth." So, too, the wailing of several of the psalmists reveals that they conceived of their bones as having lost their vigor. It would seem that among the Semites there was but an imperfect conception of the physiological part played by the bones in their bodies and that they attributed to them many of the ills of the flesh and especially of the nervous and muscular systems.4 Kinship with them was largely a common oneness of bone and flesh, 1 ? 133. 2 As in Gen. 15:11 (J) and I Sam. 17:46 (E). b'$" is found in the Aramaic and its kindred dialects. Derived as it was from a verb signifying "to be exhausted," it could most appropriately be used for "corpse." We are left in doubt as to the derivation of the Assyrian cognate. 3 "1 , "flesh," and ==gy, "bone," taken together and taken separately were made to serve the Hebrews when we might expect to find allusions to the body. Even it, the Hebrew word for the living body, occurs but a few times, as in Gen. 47:18 (J) where the Egyptians are quoted as saying, "There is naught left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands"; but this was also used for the dead body. Of the Arabic , for "body" there is scarcely a trace in other Semitic tongues. 4 See Pss. 38:4; 63:2; 84:3, etc. These passages reveal that to the psalmists ills of the body were ills of the flesh. So do Pss. 6:3; 31:11; 32:3; 38:4, etc., reveal that ills of the body were looked upon as ills of the bones.</page><page sequence="9">158 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES as is seen in Laban's remark to the youthful Jacob, "Surely thou art my bone and my flesh."' Abimelech as the son of one of their clans- women reminds the men of Shechem that he belongs to them, "Re- member also that I am your bone and your flesh."2 Even the Elders who came down from the north to negotiate with him and make him king of all Israel so addressed David though we know that the north was largely of Syrian origin.3 To primitive man nothing could have been more wonderful and mysterious than his body, not so much because he knew it to be en- dowed with life, for to him rocks and trees were so endowed, as be- cause of its complexity of structure and function. If the cultured man of today is wont at times as he contemplates the human body to exclaim in the words of our great English dramatist "What a piece of work is man!" much more must his body as he noticed it have amazed early man. But here as in the case of objects of nature about him was there little attempt to examine and understand, for the scien- tific instinct was largely wanting. Hence we are not to expect to find, as we study early Semitic man, any statements as to what he thought of his body. Only by an examination of the terms used for its parts and allusions to the supposed functions of these parts can we get at what he really understood his body to be and to be capable of doing. And even then we are often left in uncertainty. Yet though the func- tions of the organs of his head and trunk were very imperfectly under- stood by him he naturally gives us a fairly reasonable view of his con- ception of the part played by the limbs of his body, his arms and hands, his legs and feet, the functions of which are less complex and obscure than those of other parts of the body. And because he not only used his limbs but also fairly understood them he gave them ap- propriate names and names too which naturally take us back to the old life of the Semites. His shoulders were much in his thought because on them he bore many of his burdens, as Samson is said to have borne the mighty gate of Gaza along with its posts and its great bar upon his shoulders 1 Gen. 29:14 (J). 2 Judg. 9:2 (E). 3 II Sam. 5:1. (J). The Hebrew for "bone" in the phrase "my bone and my flesh" is MY . Like the Arabic it is derived from a verb meaning "to be large, mighty, vast"; but the root of the Assyrian cognate, eqemtu; it not known. The Hebrew for "flesh" in the phrase is IlZ . It has few Semitic cognates; and these have a different connota- tion. " , a less common Hebrew word for "flesh," has its cognate in the Assyrian UAru. This in the Code often appears for "well-being" or "health."</page><page sequence="10">THE EARLY SEMITE 159 off up among the hills near Hebron;' and as Hagar bore the skin of water, the bread, and child as Abraham put them upon her shoulder and turned her adrift, that as a lone nomad woman she might go forth in the hope of finding friends ere her supplies failed her. Here we have another word for "shoulder," the same that appears in Gen. 24:15 (J) where we read that the Syrian maiden Rebekah appeared to the servant of Abraham with her pitcher upon her shoulder, which was the common method of bearing such a heavy vessel especially if it chanced to be full of water.2 His arms apparently were the most important limbs of his body to the early Semite who even in his clan life could have known little in the way of division of labor. These limbs must be strong and must be kept supple in order that he might be able to labor and to handle weapons of war effectively. We read of the tribe of Joseph which was located where there was danger of frequent attack, "The arms of his hand were supple."3 Samson broke as flax the cords which were around his mighty arms.4 The valorous man of a psalmist was said to be able to bend a great bow of bronze.5 Quite as surely must such a man have been able to do this in the earlier time. Among the Semites a man's arms were often mentioned as symbols of strength as well as of defense.6 Nearly as great use was made of his hands by our early Semite as an admirable prolongation of his arms. Indeed, centuries before trace of man appeared even in the earliest folk tales he must have become skilled in his use of his hands in hunting and fishing and in other arts contributory to his simple life; and his increase in skill in their use must have played an important part in the development of his brain. We find allusions to the early Semite's use of his hands as we do to later allusions to the hands as symbols of power.' The Assyrian, which 1 Judg. 16:3 (J). The word here for "shoulder" is '?J. Its cognate is found in the Aramaic and the Arabic but not in the Assyrian. Its root is unknown. 2 Gen. 21: 14 (E).

The Arabic cognate has as its root a verb signifying "to stretch out." The arm was the limb which man stretched forth when he extended his hand. To the Deuteronomists God's arm was often the "stretched-out arm." 4 Judg. 15:14 (J). 5 18:35. 6 I Sam. 2:31;Ezek. 30:22; Ps. 83:9; Lane, p. 961. 7 The Hebrew "7 appears in Gen. 3:22 (J); 8:9 (J); Josh. 8:18 (J), etc., in a thorough- ly characteristic way, while in Num. 20:20 (JE); II Kings 19:26, etc., it has the word for hand" as a symbol of power.</page><page sequence="11">160 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES often employed its cognate of the common Hebrew word for "hand" for "arm" as well as "hand," seems to have employed it as a symbol of might or power, using more frequently another common word which it had for "hand" not found in other Semitic tongues.' Presumably the hand was given in pledge in the early time in Israel as it was in the late time, as we see according to Ezra 10:19: those who had taken foreign wives gave their hand to the priest that they would put them away. Doughty has said of the Arabs of his time, "for the better assurance of a promise they ask and give the hand; it is a visible pledge."2 The Semites had a word for "hollow" which was used for the hol- low or palm of the hand and also for the sole of the foot most sug- gestively.3 In the E narrative of Genesis we are told that the butler having been restored gave the cup into the palm of Pharaoh.4 In a later narrative we find mention of "a palmful of meal";5 while in an old anthropomorphic passage we are told that Yahweh said to Moses by way of reassuring and comforting him, "I will cover thee with my palm."6 Here again we have a word that was used like the common Hebrew word for "hand" symbolically for "power," as in Judg. 6:14 (J) when Yahweh addresses Gideon, "Go in this thy might and save Israel from the palm [hand] of Midian." Dagon was conceived of as parting with his strength as he fell upon his palms.7 To the early Semite his feet were important parts of his body; and because of his daily use of them, and because they were usually 1 The Assyrian cognate of "5I is tdu which is used for the hand and also for power or strength.

Kdta appears frequently in the Code but usually in the sense of "possession" as in ? 253. 2 Op. cit., p. 266. In the late time among the Hebrews and presumably among other Semitic peoples the hand was lifted in oaths. In Gen. 14:22 (P) Abraham is made to say to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand unto Yahweh, Elohim Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine." In the late priestly narrative Yahweh is also represented as lifting his hand in the way of solemn assurance (see Exod. 6:8 and Num. 14:30). 3 The Hebrew ". was from ZDZ, "to bend," "to bow," a cognate of which noun is found in the Assyrian, Arabic, etc., in the same sense. 4 40:21. rI Kings 17:12. This passage is thought to have a Deuteronomic coloring (see Stade and Schwally, Polychrome Text of the Books of Kings, p. 23). 6 Exod. 33:22 (J). 7 I Sam. 5:4 (E). We read that the palms of his hands upon which he fell were cut off. The text is broken as Smith suggests (Samuel, p. 38).</page><page sequence="12">THE EARLY SEMITE 161 inadequately covered, they received considerable attention.' Pre- sumably when water was abundant they were washed oftener than other parts of his body. We know that the feet of a guest, even if he had been riding camel or ass, were the concern of his host. Women were supposed to be on hand to perform this courtesy for a guest, even though he might be exhorted as water was brought him to wash his feet as Lot is said to have exhorted his guests.2 To start on a journey among the Semites was "to lift up the feet."3 To follow after another was "to be at his feet"; and a troop thus fol- lowing a leader was known as "footmen," unmounted soldiers.4 To submit abjectly to one was to bow prone before his feet, or, to speak metaphorically, "to lick the dust before him."' The great Assyrian kings insisted often that those whom they defeated should thus de- mean themselves. Sennacherib frequently alluded in his records to overpowering enemies "who bowed submissively at my feet"; and even mentions some who were brought before him "and kissed my feet," is'iku Qpaia.6 Moses presumably was supposed by the narrator to have kissed the feet of his father-in-law.7 Neither the uses made of the lower limbs nor man's regard for their comeliness changed greatly through the centuries. Hence we may quote confidently a late biblical writer: Not in the strength of a horse, Nor in the legs of a man But in those who fear him Yahweh delighteth, rhetorically exclaims a late psalmist who presumably could appreciate the words put in the mouth of the Shunammite who declared that her lover's comely legs were like pillars of marble inserted in gold.8 Men lifted their tunics as they girded their loins that they might labor or 1 The Hebrew ??'I is not found in the Assyrian but is common to other Semitic tongues (Gen. 19:2; cf. 18:4). 2 Judg. 4:10 (E). 3 Gen. 29:1 (E), found nowhere else. 4 Judg. 4:10 (E); I Sam. 4:10 (E); Exod. 12:37 (J). 5 I Sam. 25:24 (J); cf.

The Arabs are wont to say of a man who prepares himself for difficulty, "He uncovers his shank."' Elijah is said to have girded up his loins when he was about to run before Ahab.2 One ex- posed his legs and in so doing if they were comely revealed their comeliness. A late Hebrew has somewhere told us that the maiden Zipporah when she returned from the well, followed by Moses, re- marked to her father that she knew him for a modest man because when she was forced to lift her garment and reveal her legs he walked behind with downcast eyes. Nor were the knees, or leg joints, overlooked by early Semitic man.3 They seem to have been regarded as a seat of strength-a strength which might be seriously impaired by adversity or terror. Often to succor a man was to strengthen his feeble knees, as Job is said to have done. Primitive man, like savage man of today, may have been, as Frazer tells us, more insensitive to pain than is the cultured man of our time, but he certainly was beset by thousands of things which occasioned terror and weakened for a time his knees. The thigh, or loins (the Semitic terms are puzzling because they are so vague in their connotation), as the seat of life and of the pro- creative powers was a vital part of his body to the early Semite. We are told that when Abraham was about to send his trusty steward to the country whence he came that he might find among his kindred a wife for his son Isaac he made him put his hand under his thigh and swear, i.e., take oath, that he would do as requested instead of find- ing a maiden for him among the Canaanites.' Similarly, Jacob when he was near the close of his earthly career made Joseph take oath that he would bury his remains in the old burial-place of his fathers.5 It was the fact that the thigh as the seat of the genital organs was sup- posed to be possessed of the life-giving power of deity that explains why oaths were thus made.! Here, too, we discover the significance 1 Lane, p. 1471. 2 I Kings 18:46. a The Hebrew "1In has in the Assyrian cognate berku, a word which was used at times for the loins and the generative organs, as in the Annals (Luckenbill) where we have the phrase tarbit birkiia, "offspring of my loins" (p. 35, 1. 72). 4 Gen. 24:2 (J).

We read that David was told, near the close of his reign, as he was planning for a house for his God, "Thy son that shall come forth from out thy loins, he shall build the house for my name."2 The loins of the king were regarded as the divine seat of his life whence life was to come. This is in harmony with passages which we have already noticed though it is late and has a late priestly term for "the loins."3 Though late the word is a better word for the loins as they were con- ceived; for it comes from a root signifying "to fight," "to be strong," while the root of the earlier term is unknown. The loins then, even in the late time, were thought to be the seat of vigor. The seat of a man's virility was in his loins. It is not strange that early man should have made overmuch of his sexual organs, gross indulgence of which meant an enfeebled state of the body; for we shall see as we go on that though he knew that the eating of food, followed by hours of repose, meant refreshment and increase of vigor he largely failed to see that the real source of one's vitality centers in the digestive organs which transform and assimilate food and in the lungs in which the venous blood is oxygen- ated. THE HEAD It has very truly been said that "the Hebrews did not have a clear-cut psychology of the inner life of man with a well-defined ter- minology, but held a very simple view of the contribution of human nature and employed terms with a vagueness and an overlapping characteristic of popular unscientific thought."4 What is here said of the Hebrews may be said of the Semitic people of the pre-Christian time generally. The Greeks as early as the fifth century B.c., as we have seen, knew something of the brain and its functions; while the Semites who seem to have been less inclined to look to the Greeks than the Greeks were to look to them appear to have been totally ignorant of the fact that they possessed a brain or that having one it played an 1 Gen. 32:24-33 (J); Skinner, pp. 407 ff.

Hence it was necessary for them to conceive of the organs of sensation as endowed with functions which we know belong to the brain as con- trolled by man and to think of certain organs of the interior of the body as performing psychological functions which they never have performed.' The fact that the old common Semitic term for "head" was widely used has interest for us; but it is of more interest here to note that the word was so rich in its connotation.2 To the early Semites the head was the upper part or top of the body which as its ears listened, as its eyes looked out upon the world, as its nostrils inhaled its odors, and as its mouth tasted of its fruits came mysteriously to understand its environment. Having a brain, presumably in many ways the equal of the brain of the modern man, though not knowing himself to be possessed of one, he worked up the products of his senses much as we do the products of ours, without understanding how he did it.3 Hence it was necessary for him to conceive of the senses themselves as pos- sessed of many of the functions which we recognize as belonging to the brain, or the mind or self which uses the brain as its instrument. "Among the Semites, as among other early peoples," remarks S. A. Cook, "the psychical [mental and ethical] and the physical are one"; and he quotes H. Wheeler Robinson as saying, "Psychical and ethical functions are considered to be just as appropriate to bodily organs as the physiological."4 To the early Semite the ear was the organ of hearing even as it is to us. In one of the oldest J fragments Lamech exhorts his wives to give ear unto his speech;5 and in an early E narrative, in what in its original oral form was quite as old a fragment, Abimelech, son of a woman of their clan and himself in consequence a member of their clan, though Gideon his father was not, going to Shechem, bade his 1 Ibid., II, 824a. 2 The Hebrew r1bt has as Assyrian cognate re'u, head and upper part of a thing, as Arabic cognate ) "head"-the highest, uppermost part, top, or summit of a thing. Similarly, the word appears in other Semitic tongues. In the Hebrew the word is used of the head of a man and of an animal, of the top of hill or mountain, of a ladder and of a tower, and of the ears of grain. It is also used to designate the chief man of a family or clan, a principal city, or nation. 3 Some of our great anthropologists are inclined to think that man many thousands of years ago was in his brain structure superior to the man of our day. 4 Smith, op. cit., p. 634. 6 Gen. 4:25.</page><page sequence="16">THE EARLY SEMITE 165 fellow-clansmen whom he interviewed to speak in the ears of the men of their city in accord with his expressed wish as one who desired to be chosen their fighting chief.' But the ear which thus naturally is men- tioned as the organ of hearing was also regarded by the early Semite as the organ of understanding itself. The ear is thus referred to in the Code where it is mentioned along with wisdom, uznam u nemegam.2 This agrees with Bezold"s connotation of the word, where after giving Ohr as the name of the organ he gives Verstand as a secondary mean- ing of uznu (ear and understanding for uznu), illustrating its second- ary use by the phrase ina uznu igigali, with the understanding of Allweisen (Marduk), as suggesting its deeper meaning.3 This wider connotation of the word, involving as it does mental processes, appears in the Hebrew of Job 13:1, "Mine ear hath heard and understood it." Though the line is late the author here is speak- ing as an early Israelite might have done. The Arabs who made large use of the verb in its simpler sense occasionally used it in the sense of "to know a thing" or "to become informed concerning something." This reveals the fact that to them, as to other Semites, the ear was considered an organ of knowledge or understanding. The Assyrians seem to have preserved this primitive secondary use of the word for we find among them in the late time frequent allusions to the ear as the organ of understanding. The phrase ina uznu nikilti, "with skilled ear," or "with shrewd understanding," seems to have been a common one in Sennacherib's time."4 In accord with this conception of the ear is the use made by the Hebrews of their verb for "to hear" and its derivatives. In Genesis we read as the reason why the speech of the workers at the Tower of Babel was to be confounded "that they may not understand one another's speech." They could after this was done still hear but they could not understand one another. Other cognates than the Assyrian of this Hebrew verb have a like range of meaning. In the Assyrian the verb whence came the noun semu could be used even of the taking of an oral message and of one revealing skill in a case at law. The Arabs are wont to say, "God will make the ears of his creatures to hear him."5 A common use of the inten- sive form of the Arab verb "to hear" is "to make one to know" or "to make one have knowledge." 1 Judg. 9:2. 3 Babylonisch-assyrisches Glossar, p. 21b. 5 Lane, p. 1428. 2 Col. 43:2, 3. 4 See Annals, p. 109, 1. 1; p. 133, 1. 77.</page><page sequence="17">166 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES The name of the organ of sight in the Semitic tongues is so old that like their noun for the ear its root seems to have been lost; but even in the casual mention of the name for the sight there sometimes is trace of a broad connotation, as in Genesis where it is said of the tree whose fruit was forbidden the pair placed in Eden as its keepers that it was a delight to the eyes, and where it is said of Hagar after she was with child that her mistress was despised in her eyes, a feeling such as was supposed to have been "enhanced in antiquity by the universal conviction that the mysteries of conception and birth are peculiarly a sphere of divine action."'' The Hebrew phrase "as is good in thine eyes" should be noticed as characteristic. Such passages re- veal the fact that to the early Hebrews, as to their neighbors, the eyes were regarded as organs of perception and discernment as well as organs of sight. As admirably supporting our thought here is a Genesis passage in which Joseph is said to have remarked to his brothers, "Your eyes see that it is my mouth which speaketh unto you."2 Here the eyes are mentioned as organs endowed with reflec- tion as well as perception. Such phrases as "haughty eyes" and "lofty eyes" reveal a certain measure of psychical endowment on the part of the organs of sight; but they should not be pressed, because as they appear they belong to the late time however true they may be of the earlier. So, too, as to references to eyes that do not pity. The Assyrians had a phrase, "to look with longing"; and the Code provided a penalty for one who having betrothed a virgin looked with longing upon another maiden, which statute might wisely be given a place in our modern codes.3 While there is no direct allusion in the Old Testament to the smit- ing of anyone by an evil eye such fateful use of the eye must have been common among the early Hebrews as among other Semites.4 Among the Arabs we find frequent reference to "the evil eye," the smiting of which apparently is still common among the Arabs of our time. And we know "the evil look" was feared among the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians. The Hebrew verb, commonly used for "to see," "to look," "to con- sider,"5 as used in such questions as that put by Abimelech to Abraham 1 Gen. 16:4 (J); see Skinner, op. cit., p. 286. 2 45:12 (E). 3 ? 159. 4 Doughty, op. cit., p. 548; Toy, op. cit., p. 495. 5 The Hebrew ;'OI has its cognates in the Arabic, Sabaean, and Ethiopic.</page><page sequence="18">THE EARLY SEMITE 167 "What sawest thou?" has a wider connotation than the verb in its primary sense. So in a much later statement, "For he sees that wise men die."' The Arabic cognate is used of seeing things and also of perceiving with the eye or by reflection and consideration there- with. Even more surely is this wider connotation true of another verb which in the Hebrew is used of gazing or looking steadily with interest at a thing. The verb appears in the statement, "And Yah- weh saw [i.e., had regard to] Abel and his offering."2 The Assyrian cognate was used not only in the sense of "to behold" or "to look for" but also at times in the sense of "to see through" or "to look through," and even "to penetrate."3 The face itself as it reflected the moods of a man, now brightening or smiling, anon darkening with doubt or reddening with anger, was supposed by the early Semites to be possessed of power to see and even to reflect on what it saw.4 Sadness, shame, confusion, displeas- ure, and eagerness, enthusiasm, and joy could be read by one as he studied another's face; and his own response in word or act depended on what he discovered. The Assyrian panu, "sight," "face," was cog- nate of the common Hebrew word for "face" which seems to have been similarly used. The exultant way in which Sennacherib alluded to his victories over his foes upon occasion should be noted as charac- teristic. Ina muummur pani, "with radiant face," he gloried in their defeat, confusion, and death.5 What Doughty had to say of the Arabs as suspicious of all odors, as men living in an uncorrupt atmosphere, might apparently be said of the early Semitic people as a whole .6 We do know that the Hebrew term for "scent" or "odor" was used in such a way as to reveal real appreciation of pleasant smells. Isaac is said to have found "the smell" of Jacob's garment before he blessed him as the smell of a fragrant field, one Yahweh had greatly favored.' The Assyrian word for "scent" or "odor" as used reveals an appreciation of pleasant smells.8 It appears in such phrases as eresu tabu, a pleasant smell or 1 Ps. 49:11. 2 Gen. 4:4 (J2). The verb was f1.U . 3 The Assyrian was Se'is.

Sennacherib in alluding to his use of cedar and cypress in 'the building of his palaces remarked of these woods, s'd erisuun taabu, "whose scent was pleasing."' The Arabic cognate of the He- brew is used not only for "breath" and "spirit," thus revealing that it has the same verbal root; but is used also for a good, sweet, or pleasant thing.2 The early Arabs may have had sensitive nostrils; but if those of today may be taken as typical of the primitive Semites we must be- lieve that they were not possessed of a sensitive taste. One of the last things the modern man in cultured lands can stand, or stomach, is putrid meat; yet we are assured that the Arabs of the desert eat such meat without revealing any repugnance to it as unwholesome, much as they must suffer from such food.3 However, it may be the fact that they are underfed that enables them to stomach what other- wise they could not eat. It appears that the early Hebrews were not without a sense of taste, for comparatively tasteless as was their man- na its insipid taste was noted by their chronicler;4 and, according to the story as found in the old E narrative, the Israelites upon occasion murmured, "We loathe this worthless food."5 Then, too, at a later time the mouth was spoken of as finding things sweet, as wickedness to the wicked and the words of Yahweh to the righteous." Men do not thus use metaphorically a word which has ceased to have any real physical meaning to them. The early Semites could have known little of the processes of the digestion of food and of its assimilation, though when the Arabs said of a man who had died, "His eating is cut off," they must have realized that the primary significance of the taking of food and drink was the maintenance of life. So, too, the Hebrews. The allusion to Elijah as eating and drinking what had been prepared for him and of his going in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights, though late, must be taken as revealing what as a far earlier time they had found to be true of the reinforcement of life.7 1 Annals, p. 106, 1. 24. 2 Lane, p. 1181. 3 Doughty, op. cit., p. 561. 4 Num. 11:8 (J).

Indeed here, as in the case of sight and hearing, or the eyes and the ears, this organ was supposed to be mysteriously en- dowed; so that the mouth was regarded not merely as the organ of speech but also, and perchance chiefly, as the actual speaker which shaped and uttered its own thought. Characteristic of this is the re- mark of Joseph, already quoted for another purpose, to his brothers, "Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you." So, too, of the words of David to the young man who came to him and told him he had given Saul the finishing stroke, "Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee."4 The Assyrian also referred to the mouth as possessed of speech, discourse, decision, judgment, command, as in the Code where we come upon the phrase ina pilu kabtim, "with his potent command." Hence it was that in some mysterious way the mouth and not the man or god using the mouth was supposed to be responsible for the character of the utterance.5 The mouth's words might be as empty, as void of sense, as a great wind; they might be wanton; or perchance they might be fraught with wisdom, though it is hardly likely that the average member of a clan in the early time dropped any pearls of thought in his discourse. Nevertheless the mouth was at times alluded to as controlled by its possessor, as when one was said to en- treat with his mouth; to open his mouth in solemn vow to his God, or even to be awed and rendered silent." One who was not eloquent was 1 The Hebrew verb is ?ZX, while the Assyrian cognate was akdlu and the Arabic 2 The Hebrew for mouth was '011, and the Assyrian was pu, a cognate. a Gen. 27:26 (J); 31:28 (E). 4 II Sam. 1:16 (E). s 42:79; cf. use in Job 8:2; Isa. 9:16; Ps. 37:30, all late yet faintly reminiscent of man's imperfect understanding of himself and his mouth in the early time. 6 Judg. 11:35 (E); ef.

In harmony with the thought of the mouth as an opening into the inwards of a man is the metaphorical use of the word, common to the Semites, for the opening of a well, of a cave, and to it as the pores of the ground which receives the blood shed or poured out. It is also used of the entrance to Sheol.2 Nor were the Semites ignorant of the fact that the lips themselves had important functions to perform, though here as elsewhere when they mentioned other parts of the head, used in communication with the outside world, they conceived of the lips as more richly endowed than facts warranted.3 In their thought they were not only employed in speech, or the semblance thereof, and in eating; but they were them- selves organs of judgment, decision, and statement, as in the Assyrian. The lips are mentioned in the Hebrew as organs used in laughter, in derision, and in insult.4 The word in Hebrew, as in other Semitic tongues, was used of speech or language, as in the myth of the tower of Babel where we read that "the whole earth was of one lip [language] and of one speech."5 The voice, reinforced by significant gestures, was well-nigh the only means of communication the early Semite had with his fellow- clansmen.6 The old and common Semitic term for voice, though used for many different sounds which even out upon their vast silent steppes were occasionally heard, frequently appears in the hexateuchal narratives. It was used as revealing one's person as when Isaac is made to say, "The voice is Jacob's voice" ;' and it was used of persua- sive speech, as when Abraham in Gen. 16:2 (J) is said to have been moved to listen to his wife. In an old passage in which Yahweh was 1 Exod. 4:10 (J); cf. Job 5:16. 2 Gen. 29:2 (J); Josh. 10:18 (E); Gen. 4:11. 3 The Assyrians had the phrase vaptd a lulld, "lips of luxury or wantonness."

The Assyrian cognate of the Hebrew was used for the voice, also for the braying and screeching of animals. ? Gen. 27:22 (E).</page><page sequence="22">THE EARLY SEMITE 171 anthropomorphized the sound of his footsteps is said to have been heard.' The tongue which the Semites could see was used in eating was widely recognized as an organ of speech and of singing or of their peculiar chant or recitative. This wide use was especially true of the word in the Assyrian; for here the tongue is not only the organ of speech but is itself speech and even dialect or manner of speaking.2 Indeed, very generally among the Semites the word as used revealed the tongue to be capable of seduction, slander, arrogance, and even as playing the part of a scourge. At the same time it was alluded to as capable of chasteness and cleanness of speech and as the organ of impassioned eloquence.3 The tongue, the lips, and other organs of the head might puzzle the early Semites but not so the teeth, the functions of which are to the primitive man so simple and so easily understood. As they bit with them and with them masticated their food, the teeth, so long as they were able to keep them sound, played their part in their lives without in any way mystifying them. In times of anger they might half-consciously gnash with them, and if they took acids into their mouths might find their teeth curiously set on edge; but they found no occasion for referring to them as playing any psychological func- tions in their efforts to understand or master their world, unless indeed they tested the nature or quality of substances by biting them.4 And even here there was nothing about the teeth themselves that seemed occult. It is noteworthy that all early Semites had but the one common word for the teeth,5 and it is also noteworthy that at a time when the 1 Gen. 3:8 (J). See Skinner, op. cit., p. 77; cf.

Though most of these passages are late they reveal the fact that the Hebrews came to look upon the tongue even in the early time as the chief organ of speech though they may not until the late time have held it responsible for the sins of the indi- vidual and then perchance only imaginatively. 4 Job 16:9; Ezek. 18:2; Jer. 31:29 f. 5 Of the Assyrian root of gennu we find no trace. The root of the Hebrew I) seems to have been pt, "to whet," "to sharpen," but this may not have been its primitive sense. The root of the Arabic presumably takes us back to the original, for it has the force of "to bite," the teeth being "the biters."</page><page sequence="23">172 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES teeth must often have played their part in petty encounters that lex talionis should have been in force just here. In the Code there was provision for the knocking-out of a tooth of a man who had knocked out the tooth of another, as there was in the earliest Hebrew code.' Owing to a misconception in the Hebrew and certain other Semitic tongues, their common word for "tooth" was used of elephant's tusks, for ivory, because such tusks were thought to resemble teeth. With greater fidelity to nature in the early time the tines of a fork or fleshhook were designated as teeth. The one sense, the organs of which lie in the skin of the whole body, though more particularly in the face and hands, the former of which among nomads plays an important part in their lives owing to exposure to all weathers and the need of sensing changes therein, is feeling or the sense of touch. The words put in the mouth of Jacob reveal what the old nomads had to endure, "Thus was I, in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes." But if one incurred suffering through exposure to all weathers in Syria and Canaan much more must he have done so out *upon the desert.2 In another narrative in which Jacob as a younger man played an important part we are told that as he was urged by his mother to deceive his father in the absence of Esau and secure the birthright blessing he expressed fear, "Peradventure he will feel me"3 -a fear that seems to have been warranted, for we read that Isaac said as he entered his presence, "Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son."4 How true to the old nomad life this episode is! We read in Exodus of the darkness which was said to have afflicted Egypt that it was "a darkness which could be felt," a phrase which primi- tive man could appreciate, though we may question whether the skin could sense such darkness. The blind Samson, intent on destroying the building in which, according to this legendary narrative, he had been shamefully mocked, must feel, or touch with his hands, the pillars between which he stood before putting forth his great strength for the last time and bringing down in so doing the vast and heavy roof upon the Philistines.5 1 See Code, ?? 200, 201, and Exod. 21:24 (E). 2 Gen. 31:40 (J); see G.

One might grope, as Laban is said to have done looking for something in a partially lighted tent, and feeling for something;' but the early Semite must have done so as the modern man would do under like circumstances. He made large use of this sense and was intensely aware of its value; he may even have endowed in thought his rude gods and things scattered about him with this sense, for he surely could not have ridiculed idols as a late psalmist did as insensitive; but in every way his exercise of the sense must have been normal. Inasmuch as the sense of touch or feeling is a primitive sense we naturally expect to get some help from etymology; but we get little, for primitive as was the sense we find few allusions to its exercise, partly perchance because in thought the early Semites so richly en- dowed the organs of the interior of their bodies and put so much upon them. The Arabic verb for "to touch," "to feel," a cognate of the Hebrew verb, was used not only of touching and feeling but also of striking and smiting; while the Assyrian cognate had the sense of spreading on, smearing, rubbing off, cleaning, though presumably it originally was used of touching or feeling.2 Apparently the verb was used in the Assyrian in the later time of the anointing or smearing the face with an unguent. While the scarcity of water out on the desert forces the Arabs often to make large use of sand in removing sveat and filth from their faces if not from their bodies, those able to do so have used the fat of beasts or unguents in their care of their skin. Nor were the Hebrews neglectful of their skin. They made large use of olive oil.3 The hair and beard of the early Semite were to him of vast im- portance. As Robertson Smith'has remarked, "The hair is regarded by primitive peoples as a living and important part of the body;"4 1Gen. 31:33 f. (E). 2 The Arabic verb L" is cognate of the Hebrew IgI , and the Assyrian mavd u is cognate of the same. 3 In speaking of the Arabs, Smith says, "Perfumes were habitually used in the form of unguents" (op. cit., p. 480); Encyclopaedia Biblica, cols. 3468 f. 4 Smith, op. cit., p. 324 and n. 2.</page><page sequence="25">174 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES and S. A. Cook says, "A man's hair contains his strength, vitality, or vital principle";' and Smith himself refers to eminent authorities who have collected many instances to show that the hair has often been regarded as a special seat of life and strength. The saga of Samson which manifestly, as one of the earliest folk stories of the Old Testament, is true to the early thought in picturing the shorn man as deprived of strength which comes back to him as his hair grows out once more.2 A man's hair and beard in primitive time were his glory and apparently would have been so considered by the early Semite even if he had not regarded them as seats of life and vigor. No small part of Absalom's popularity seems to have been owing to his abund- ant and marvelous hair.3 Doughty tells us that a heavy black beard is held in honor among the Arabs.4 David's ambassadors of condo- lence, sent to Ammon, are said to have turned shamefacedly home- ward after Hanun had impiously had them shorn. It was character- istically thoughtful in David to order them to tarry in Jericho until their beards were grown.' It is evident from the narrative of the children who came out of Bethel and taunted Elisha only to be de- stroyed by the bears that "baldhead" was a term of shame or re- proach.6 The pitiful condition of a devastated land is described in a late prophetic passage having to do with Judah which is personified as a man shorn of the hair of his head, his beard, and the hair of his genital organs.7 The common Semitic word for "hair" surely carries us back to the old nomadic life and with the more force as it was sometimes used of a hairy skin which may have been characteristic of the covering of the early Semite, if indeed it does not to the time when the Semite was "a hairy man"; for it is hardly likely that Elijah was the only man of his time among the Hebrews who could be thus referred to.8 1 Ibid., p. 607; cf. Frazer, op. cit., III, 258 if. Elsewhere in his great work Frazer in speaking of the loss of the hair remarks, "It is believed that the head chief of the Masai would lose his supernatural power if his chin Were shaved" (I, 344). 2Judg. 16:17 ff.

The Hebrew word for "hair," Ogr , has its cognate in the Arabic , and in the Assyrian idrtu; the Hebrew for "beard" has cognates in other Semitic tongues so that 1.TI and its cognates take us back as do JZT and its cognates to the early hairy Semites, who gloried in their shocks of hair and their flowing beards.</page><page sequence="26">THE EARLY SEMITE 175 THE INWARDS We have seen that the early Semites, not knowing that they pos- sessed a brain, which as used by them was made to work up the products of sensation, were forced to conceive of the senses as per- forming certain psychical functions which they could never have ex- ercised. We now turn to the inwards only to discover that some of man's internal organs were thought to be possessed of marvelous powers, though at the same time there was almost no conception of the real functions of these organs. Such conceptions of the inwards were by no means confined to the Semitic peoples. They are charac- teristic of savage man today, and they were held by primitive man everywhere. A recent writer "alludes to words among all early people which connect mental and moral qualities with the heart, the stomach, and even the kidneys and the bowels."' Therefore quite as necessary to an understanding of early Semitic man as a study of his head and the functions performed, according to his thought, by its orgafis is a study of his conception of his inwards, or heart, as our Old Testament translators so often rendered the term. There is no mistaking here the part of the body, or trunk, desig- nated as "the inwards." The old Babylonian libbu had its cognates in other Semitic tongues, the Hebrew, Arabic, and others, in all of which it was widely and commonly used for the inwards, the organs both above and below the diaphragm.2 The word was used by the Semites to designate the organs of the inwards as the seats of the thoughts, emotions, and even the ethical aspirations, choices, and de- terminations of a man. According to the Code, under certain circum- stances a man might marry a woman if he chanced to be "the man of her inwards [choice]."3 Yet under other circumstances a woman might or might not be granted the fulness of her inwards (i.e., her heart's desire).4 Hammurabi is alluded to as rejoicing the inner self of Mar- duk and as pacifying the inwards of Adad.5 In early Hebrew story we are told of a man traveling with his concubine who was urged to accept hospitality that his inner self might be made merry, i.e., that 1 Hastings, op. cit., II, 824a; cf.

Abimelech in the integrity of his inner self, we are told, received Sarah, thinking to make her, as a comely woman, his wife." The hardening of Pharaoh's inwards was the making of him obstinate, stubborn, so that he would refuse to let the Israelites leave. This as a part of the priestly narrative of the Hexateuch is flatly contradictory of the old JE narratives; but though late it must have been psychologically true of the early time.3 In the Annals we read of one who tore his inwards, i.e., broke his courage and fled, as we do of those enemies whose inwards planned resistance.4 Sennacherib tells us in speaking of his campaign against Hezekiah that the inwards of the Jews became fearful, iplah libbasun.5 He also tells us that as his foes upon occasion came against him he hurriedly mounted ina uggat libbiia, "in the anger of my inwards."6 Again he remarks that as Babylon was evacuated by Merodach-baladan he in the joy of his inwards and with radiant face hastened thereto and entered the sumptuously furnished palace.' Here as upon other occasions his exultancy of spirit is noteworthy as he alludes to his victories. Manifestly though we have here to do with an advanced stage of culture, far removed from the simple clan life of the early Semites, we have to conclude that the terms are those of the old nomadic life. They certainly reveal but a crude understanding of human physiology and psychology. The Hebrew of an old passage in Genesis carries us farther back but it gives us substantially the same primitive, imperfect knowledge of man's interior we come upon in the Annals. Abraham's steward remarks to Laban as he speaks of his meeting Rebekah at the well, "Before I had done speaking in my 1 Judg. 19:9 (J).

The Hebrew phrase i'g9-tb' here and elsewhere should be ren- dered "in the integrity of my heart [inwards]" rather than "in my simplicity" as has usually been done (see Skinner, op. cit., pp. 317 if.). 3 Exod. 7:13, etc. The Hebrew verb WpTM, "to be firm," "to strengthen," "to make obstinate," has its cognate in the Arabic and Aramaic in the sense of "to bind."

This certainly was a nomad's characteristic way of al- luding to his mental processes in prayer. Yet it may be paralleled by a nomadic phrase in the Code, used of a shepherd, given oxen and sheep to pasture, who, it is said, was satisfied with his remunera- tion, "His inwards were made glad [libba'u tab]."2 But to understand the early Semite's allusions to his inner self we must note what he conceived to be the more important parts of it. Here we shall miss allusions to organs that are known to us to be vital, as the heart, of whose functions they were ignorant, and the lungs, of which they knew next to nothing. This does not surprise us; for, as C. H. Toy has said, "The heart was of less significance in the ancient thought than the liver, it being of less size, and its function in the circulation of the blood not being known,"3 while we may add the structure, color, and apparent emptiness of the lungs would natu- rally detract from their interest in them. It was different with those parts of the trunk below the diaphragm, the organs of the abdominal region as contrasted with those of the thorax. These to primitive man were largely what he had in mind when he spoke of his inwards. His understanding of these organs was the more defective because he did so little in the way of vivisection. Such openings of bodies as were made were largely necessitated by the cutting-up of men and animals for sacrifice or for determining the propitious time of under- takings, etc., by their diviners. Hence in their opening-up of bodies they were not interested to discover all the organs included therein nor even the real functions of those they did notice. The elders of their clans among the Semites, serving as they usually did as priests, had always their definitive objects; yet limited as were their func- tions as priests they, like the diviners of their people, could hardly have failed to note a few facts. The one organ which was most to impress the Semites because of 1 Gen. 24:45 (J). The primary meaning of the noun as it appears in the Arabic use of it is illuminating. It is used of a nut and the like in the sense of "What is in the inside," i.e., the heart, the kernel.

This they knew as "the heavy," a word which in the Assyrian was sometimes used for the belly and even for the inwards, so inexact were the Babylonians and Assyrians in speaking of the bodies of men and beasts. Ordi- narily, however, it served to designate what is known to us as the liver. They believed this organ to be not only the seat of the emo- tions but also the seat of life itself. So of other Semitic people. "The soul," said one, thus revealing the Arabian thought, "is in the liver."2 This thought of the liver as the seat of life and emotion may partly explain why the liver of animals was so frequently con- sulted by their diviners.3 It was supposed that it "could be made to reflect the very soul and intention of God." To primitive man next in importance among the internal organs of the body were the bowels, the functions of which must have been partially understood. The vital nature of the bowels and the ease with which they might be given a fatal blow were also perceived. A dagger-thrust and a man's condition was rendered hopeless; a rip with a short sword and a man was left on the ground disemboweled as Amasa was left by Joab.4 The Semites did not speak of a valorous man as having "guts"; but they seem to have known those unpos- sessed of power to control their bowels under certain circumstances. Sennacherib boasts upon occasions that as he hotly pursued leaders of hosts he had defeated in battle their entrails (apparently the con- tents of them) ran down into their chariots and befouled them." The bowels more than any other part of the inwards were regarded as the seat of the emotions. We read of those whose "bowels were moved," 1 In the Assyrian the word for "liver" was kabitu, or better kabattu, from kabdtu, "to be heavy." The Arab cognate 4&gt;.dused for the interior of the earth, and for its min- erals, of a house in the middle of a region, etc., and for the liver was from S, a verb meaning to be in trouble, difficulty, apparently a departure from its original sense, as must be its use in those Semitic tongues in which it has come to mean "to be honored," for the honored one must have been the heavy, or weighty one; and indeed the Hebrew verb, which primarily means "to be heavy," has the secondary meaning "to be honored," as in Gen. 34:19 and Num. 22:15 (both JE). 2 For the liver as the seat of thought and emotion see Toy, op. cit., p. 419; Smith, Religion of the Semites, p. 379; and Cook's notes to the last edition, pp. 620, 634; cf. Ezek. 21:26. 3 Moore, History of Religions, I, 227. 4 II Sam. 20:10 (J); so Budde, Books of Samuel (Pol. text), p. 48. 5 Annals, p. 45, 1. 4; p. 47, 1. 31.</page><page sequence="30">THE EARLY SEMITE 179 as we do of one whose bowels sounded dolefully like a lute for Moab in her affliction.' This does not surprise us, for we know that even now there are many whose bowels respond to their emotional states; we, however, do not think, as the Semites did, of the bowels as occa- sioning such states, we rather think of the bowels as reflexively re- sponding to our emotions as we are stirred. It would seem, however, that the Semites were more emotional than were the ancient Aryans and in consequence could often say with Job, "Mine inwards boil and rest not." It is not the purpose of the writer of this paper in his endeavor to bring to light in outline, if nothing more, early Semitic man, to dwell especially upon woman as distinct from man; yet he may be pardoned for a digression just here. As we have seen, the bowels were sometimes alluded to as the womb, or as the part of the body whence came the child in whom the life of the parents was to find a link connecting them with their posterity. We should also note that the Semitic word for the womb, common to the Hebrew and other tongues, if the Arabic and possibly the Assyrian root can be depended on, was from a verb meaning "to be soft, gentle, tender, loving."2 The Hebrew has two nouns alike and apparently from the same Semitic root, one for the womb and one for love or compassion. There seems to be some un- certainty here but of one thing we are assured, we have to do with old and common Semitic words when we speak of the terms for the bowels and of the womb and the terms used therefor. Though they were brought down into the late time they must be among the oldest Semitic words we possess. We surmise that the kidneys did not attract the attention of the early Semites that the liver provoked. The fat in which they were imbedded may have been used in their old clan sacrifices but the or- gans themselves c6uld not have greatly interested them, especially 1 Isa. 16:11; cf. 63:15; Job 30:27. The word for the bowels in the Hebrew 01~t has its cognate in the Assyrian md'u and in the Arabic C.w. Occasionally we come upon mention of the bowels when the womb was in the thought of the writer, the Hebrew being loosely used. Children are alluded to as coming from one's bowels, as in Gen. 15:4; II Sam. 7:12. The last passage here was late but the first belongs to J and the second to E. 2The Hebrew word for the womb, :rj"J. The verb tl'rju, which does not appear in the Old Testament, may have as its cognate the Arabic , "to be soft, gentle," or , "to have compassion."</page><page sequence="31">180 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES as they could have had no real understanding of their functions.' But in later time, as the kidneys became better known and a name had been found for them, they were conceived to be, presumably because of sensations involving them and the bladder, sensitive and vital organs; and so they were regarded as seats of emotions and affec- tions. Not otherwise could they account for their being disturbed dur- ing violent emotional states. Hence it was that when they spoke in the late time of Yahweh as testing or trying a man's inwards the kidneys were specially mentioned.2 As we have seen, the early Semites can have known but little of the heart and its functions. In consequence, they have nothing to say of the circulation of the blood through the arteries and veins; nor have other peoples had until recent centuries. To them the blood was the blood of the whole body, not the blood of the heart. It was something which could be shed or poured out by wounding any part of the body. We are not to be misled by the Assyrian phrase damu sa surri which Bezold renders "the blood of the heart" (Blut des Herzens); for the inwards rather than the heart as a separate organ were meant by surru.3 Yet little as they knew of the movements of the blood in the body and the functions it performs in the building- up of tissue it was to them the life of the body, and the more so because when it was shed the body became inert and lifeless. It need not be thought strange that the priests of the late time among the Hebrews in harmony with the earlier thought should have asserted, "The life of the flesh is in the blood"; for they could see that deprived of it the body ceased to function; neither man nor beast could live without blood. The body and its limbs, the head and its organs, the inwards and their imperfectly understood parts, be- came useless if drained of blood. The blood of the early Semite, like the blood of primitive man generally, was clan blood. Hence if a member of a clan was slain the 1 The Hebrew plural for the kidneys is rJ ), no trace of which is found in either J or E, the Assyrian cognate of which was kaldti. 2 Pss. 7:10; 139:13; Jer. 11:20; for "kidneys, the reins, as seat of affections and emo- tions" (Briggs, Psalms.

The story of the murder of Abel by Cain manifestly was not a part of the old J narrative into which apparently in the interests of animal sacrifices it was thrust.' Consequently, its late character leads us to conclude that the blood which cried from the ground was not clan blood but rather, in harmony with the story, that of an individual having no clan connection. Such an individual might be conceived to exist even though it might be impossible to find one other than an outcast rep- robate. The conception of blood as the life of men and animals had much to do with the use made of it by the early Semites who if they did not drink blood, as many primitive peoples did for their reinforce- ment, poured it out very often as a precious gift to their gods. Robert- son Smith who reminds us that many savages drink fresh blood by way of nourishment, and esteem it a special delicacy, and who quotes several well-recognized authorities in support of his statement, as- serts, "The sacrificial use of blood . . . . is connected with a series of very important ritual ideas, turning on the conception that the blood is a special seat of the life."2 RENEWAL OF THE BODY If the early Semite did see that the body's vigor was renewed by the reception of food and drink when he was hungry and thirsty, little as he understood the digestive processes, quite as surely must he have found that renewal came through rest and sleep. Presumably the late psalmist who could exclaim At once in peace I will lie down and sleep; For thou, Yahweh, alone makest me to dwell securely;3 was no more conscious of the value of rest and undisturbed sleep than was the ancient Semite. While nothing is said in the old J narrative of the Israelites resting there is an allusion to Elim, an oasis which the people are said to have reached soon after their escape from Egypt, where amid the twelve springs of water and the seventy palm 1 Gen. 4:2-15; see Ball, Book of Genesis (Pol. text), p. 3; Skinner, op. cit., pp. 110 f.; Kent, Beginnings of Hebrew History, pp. 57 f. 2 Op. cit., pp. 233 ff. 8 Ps. 4:9.</page><page sequence="33">182 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES trees they encamped.' Though we may not be able to forget that the host led out was fabled to have consisted of millions of souls, we may accept this narrative as giving us a charming picture of early nomadic life, for thus nomads have ever rested;2 and in such gardens of delight, if they were so happy as to come upon them, they have slept un- disturbed. In what is presumably a provision of the earliest Hebrew code we find mention of the seventh day as a day of rest, "Six days shalt thou do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest; and the son of thy handmaid and the alien may be refreshed.'" Whatever the later significance of the seventh day in Hebrew thought may have been it was for the people of the early time a day of rest when they "might get breath," or "might secure refreshment [renewal]," and so find themselves as the next day dawned girded for the work of six days. This provision of an ancient code is deserving of study because it has three common Hebrew verbs: one "to settle down," "to remain," "to rest" ; another "to cease," "to cut off," "to rest";5 and the third "to get breath," "to be refreshed."6 The Code informs us that Hammurabi "rested, quieted the inwards of Adad," the verb being the common Semitic verb for "to rest." Very happily is the Sabbath thought to be desig- nated by the Assyrian as um nuh libbi; "a day of rest of the inwards." I Exod. 15:27; for the perplexing section of which this verse is a part see Kent, Beginnings of Hebrew History, pp. 176 ft. 2 The common verb for "to rest," '3, has in the Assyrian a cognate, ndIu, of the same meaning; while the Arabic cognate is more nomadic in its connotation, the verb U having the force "to make the camel lie down," and the noun UA stands for "the resting place of a camel." Originally the common Semitic verb must have had the force of "to settle down and remain," which was the nomad's thought of the rest desirable to secure. 3 Exod. 23:12 (J); see Kent, Israel's Laws and Legal Precedents, p. 106. 4 The Hebrew t'Vij, "to settle down," "to remain," "to rest"; nt7 , "to cease," "to cut off," and "to rest from labor," have their cognates in most of the Semitic tongues. Apparently the ancient Arabic did not so use its noun for "rest"; for there is no evidence that the heathen Arabs kept a seventh day. 5 Jastrow, op. cit., pp. 134 ff. 6 Eccles. 5:11; yet there were times when the life of a nomad having the care of flocks and herds was one of anxiety and sleeplessness, as Jacob revealed (Gen. 31:40 [E]); cf. David's testimony (I Sam. 17:34 [El). The Hebrew word for "sleep," 0~#~f, has vittu for its cognate in the Assyrian and X for its cognate in the Arabic.</page><page sequence="34">THE EARLY SEMITE 183 While no passage in the early Hebrew that reveals the thought of the renewal which comes through sleep can be quoted, the frequent use of the verb for "to sleep" and its derivative noun is most suggestive. A late Hebrew recognized what sleep means to the laboring man even in the early time as he declared, "The sleep of the laborer is sweet"; or to put the emphasis where he intended it to be put, "Sweet is the sleep of the laborer," adding as he did, "whether he eat little or much." It seems that this writer had 'discovered that "the satiety of the rich will not suffer him to sleep." Here surely he was speaking of his own time, for early clan life could have no rich members and could have known nothing of wealth save as it sometimes came upon it in popu- lous centers or as it passed through its lonely steppes in great cara- vans. If the Arab of today is in circumstances and physique a fair type of the early time then must the early Semite have known the sweetness of the sleep of the man who feeds meagerly. The primitive Semite presumably wearied quite as easily as did he of a far later time. The use made in the Hebrew of an old verbal adjective suggests this. Much of the old clan fighting was done afoot, and the pursuit of raiders often involved the fighting men of a clan in long and wearisome efforts ere the raiders were overtaken even when flocks and herds had been seized. According to ancient Hebrew legend having to do with the raiding of his clan by desert nomads, the elders of Succoth were severely punished by Gideon because they refused him bread when his men were wearied and faint in the pursuit. The punishment came upon his return from his successful pursuit when the matter of time was of less consequence.' According to a later and presumably authentic narrative, but one which reveals semi-nomadic conditions, when the aged David was driven from Jeru- salem and was in flight with his hastily gathered forces Zeba met him with saddled asses loaded with supplies, remarking after he had spo- ken of the food that the wine was for such as might faint in the wild country and need reinforcement to hearten them.2 These narratives belong to the old J saga; but we have in E a characteristic nomad 1 Judg. 8:15 ff. (J). 2 II Sam. 16:2. The Hebrew verb .J1 has an Arabic cognate which is suggestive, , "to run," "to become weary."</page><page sequence="35">184 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES story which should not be overlooked. It is the one which tells of the flight of Sisera after the defeat of his north Canaanitish force. Having taken refuge in the tent of a nomad woman, he was slain by her as he as a wearied man slept. Sisera may be conceived to have been a large and valorous man; but even such as he would be utterly exhausted by a long flight, especially if he chanced to be heavily armored.' The great need of such nomads as Gideon led was bread to appease their hunger and drink to quench their terrific thirst. They can go a long time without sleep in the excitement of the chase but food and drink and the little breath which they get while eating and drinking they must have; while a warrior, utterly exhausted as Sisera is reported to have been, must rest after eating and drinking. He has got to the end of his resources; he can go no farther. Early Semitic man must have suffered from disease and sickness; for even now the life of the Arabian nomad is by no means a life of sturdy health and freedom from disease, as many suppose it to be. Their physical maladies are many and severe and cause intense dis- comfort. Doughty tells us that men among the Arabs are already in- firm at middle age ;2 and he declares that "the Arabs think themselves always ailing." As a physician who lived long among them and pre- scribed for thousands his testimony should be unhesitatingly accepted. It would seem that the Arabs, owing to filthy water and insufficient food, are greatly troubled with visceral complaints. If the fugitive life of those who inhabit Arabia at the present time renders them "the most miserable of mankind" we can hardly think of the early Semitic man as more favorably circumstanced or more vigorous and healthier.3 Often apparently early Semitic man lived in fear, as seems to have been true of primitive man generally, so imperfectly did he under- 1 Judg. 4:6-23 (E). See Moore, op. cit., pp. 115 ff., and the same author's Book of Judges (Pol. text), p. 32. Dr. Moore emends a part of vs. 21 so as to make it read, "he being sound asleep and exhausted."

He never knew what unseen powers might seek to thwart or injure him as he moved timorously about; for close as he lived to nature his ignorance of the material world was dense and appalling. And as S. A. Cook has remarked, "Ignorance of causes and ignorance of important physiological functions are common sources of fear, and although fear is dormant and easily aroused, the conquest of nature and victory over fear of the unknown are the be- ginning of social development."' But primitive man is slow in mak- ing such conquest; and it is presumable that early Semitic man did not find it any easier to lay aside his fears than men in other parts of the world. We have been forced to leave behind the thought that even one favored branch of the Semitic stock was a depository of a supernatural revelation that rendered it possible for them to discuss all fear and face nature confidently. Mythical and legendary as is much of the material in the early part of the Book of Genesis it pictures with tolerable fidelity the tim- orous nature of the early Semite. The first man is said to have been fearful after he had eaten of the fruit that made the eater wise.2 Abraham needed to be exhorted against fear by Yahweh when it seemed to him he must die childless, leaving none to inherit his wealth and keep alive his name in the earth; and Isaac feared he might lose his comely wife, a fear to which such a nomad was subject in a hostile country.3 Moses feared exposure and reprisal after he had killed the Egyptian.4 Though all these records of supposed incidents belong to the mythical and legendary lore of early Israel they must be under- stood to reflect what was measurably true of that old life. We how- ever should not overlook the fact that the early life of the Semites was clan life and that life never had such individualistic features as appear in the patriarchal narratives which seem to have been given form after the Hebrews had left their nomadic life behind and had long been settled in Canaan.

The verb in all these passages is ", common to the Hebrew though with few if any cognates in other Semitic tongues.</page><page sequence="37">186 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES thought that, in the earlier time when the life of the people was a well- developed clan life and they had their communal feasts in which they were joined in thought by their gods, there was little fear on the part of individual clansmen as compared with the later time when they had become more cultured and had acquired more exalted and awesome conceptions of their gods?' A careful reading of the Golden Bough and kindred works makes it evident that primitive life, like savage life today, must have encountered the supernatural on all sides and consequently have lived in fear. Danger of breaking some taboo which if broken would mean suffering if not death must ever have been faced. Even in Babylonia in the late time superstition was rife; much more must it have been in the nomadic days of their fathers. It has been said of Babylonia that it is a land not of laughter but of gloom and of serious meditation;2 while of Arabs it has been remarked, "Though they be full of knavish humor I never saw among them a merry man."3 Of Semitic life generally others have similarly spoken. Indeed, S. A. Cook in the passage from which we have quoted says, "Gloom, it has been said, pervades Semitic religion, and distin- guishes it from the healthy, happy tone that characterizes the religion of the Rig Veda as a whole."4 Whatever may be said of the old Babylonians and Assyrians and of the Arabs past and present some of the northern early Semites, those at least of Canaan and Syria, were a tolerably happy folk.5 Their sunny hill country and their temperate climate were more con- ducive to a joyous, happy existence than were the river-bottoms and their climate in Mesopotamia and the arid steppes of Arabia. We do know that the early life of the Hebrews as it found expression in their early lore bears the marks of contentment and even of joy. Frag- ments of early song are suggestive just here. The "Song of the Well" 1 Op. cit., pp. 54 ff. 3 Doughty, op. cit., p. 434; II, 85. 2 Ibid., p. 588. 4 Smith, op. cit., p. 588. 5 G. A. Smith in reminding us of the Semites' contribution to the religious thought and life of the world goes on to remark, "For this high destiny the race were prepared by their age-long seclusion in Arabia. In the deserts of Arabia life is wonderfully tempered. Nature is monotonous, the distractions are few, the influence of things seen is as weak as it may be in this universe; the long fasts, necessary every year, purge the body of its grosser elements, the soul easily detaches itself, and hunger lends the mind a curious pas- sion, mixed of resignation and hot anger." True perchance; but the Semites of Canaan and Syria as we encounter them in our study had been separated for many years and had lived in a different land and climate (see Historical Geography of the Holy Land).</page><page sequence="38">THE EARLY SEMITE 187 and the exhortation of Miriam may be taken as typical.' The poem which follows the latter is recognized by scholars as late, but the open- ing lines, however legendary the narrative having to do with the es- cape of Israel may be, are old and ring with genuine enthusiasm. The poetic exhortation of Num. 24:5 (JE) is a joyous nomadic frag- ment, How goodly are thy tents, 0 Jacob, Thy habitations, 0 Israel. A noteworthy glimpse of the old life in Canaan appears in the words of Laban to Jacob in which he declares that if he had left openly he would have sent him away with gladness and song.2 In an old E narrative we are told that Jethro, a desert clan presumably, rejoiced in all the good Yahweh had done Israel.3 The verbs used in these passages are characteristic.4 Whatever may have been true of the Semitic stock when it found its way down into Lower Mesopotamia and mixed with the Sumerian it would seem that those Babylonians who pressed north into the higher regions and became known to the world as Assyrians developed into a world-power of the first magnitude; yet partly perchance be- cause of their position as a buffer nation and partly because of their severe winters they naturally took life more seriously than did the Hebrews in Canaan. Having become militaristic in order to hold their land and live, the Assyrians gendered and developed a passion for conquest and became dominant, yielding to none and conquering all. As their lust for power increased and nations more and more sub- mitted to them they became proud, overbearing, and merciless, and in so becoming discovered none of the deeper sources of satisfaction. 1 Num. 21:17 f. (J); Exod. 15:1 (J). 2 Gen. 31:27 (J). 3 Exod. 18:9. 4 The Semitic verbs expressive of joy and gladness should not be overlooked for the Hebrew is especially rich in these. ,loli is nowhere common though an old verb as found in the Hebrew and Assyrian. We have come upon it in Exod. 18:9, and the Assyrian has it once in the Code. It also appears in the Aramaic. M12u , "to rejoice," "to be glad," is very common in the Hebrew; while in the Assyrian 8amdbu is used in the sense of "to sprout up," "to flourish" rather than "to rejoice," and the Arabic cognate is used in the sense of "to be high," "to be proud" rather than "to be glad." J'i and ":,I "to be good, pleasing, joyous," appears in Judg. 16:25 (J) and I Sam. 25:36 (J) in the sense of "to be merry" or "to be in high spirits," a condition conduced by the liberal use of wine. The verb is a common Semitic verb but is not broad enough in its connotation to be con- sidered a synonym of those already mentioned. On the other hand, the Hebrew has in 5i, , and J:'- verbs expressive of joyous emotions, but as used they are late.</page><page sequence="39">188 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Our study has not given us a well-rounded conception of early Semitic man. That we cannot have until we come to know more of the clan life which he shared with his fellows, know more of his home and family life, have seen him working among others, have seen him endeavoring to get some knowledge of the life around him and of the world in which his lot was cast, and have seen him finally in his ef- forts to understand and live at peace with the all-encompassing un- seen agencies which so strangely awed him and so frequently un- nerved him and kept him from achieving his best. But such a study would mean a volume on the life of the early Semite, while this is but a short and fragmentary paper of limited scope.</page></plain_text>
