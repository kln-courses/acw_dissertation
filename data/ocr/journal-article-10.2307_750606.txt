<plain_text><page sequence="1">A TANNER MANUSCRIPT IN THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY AND SOME NOTES ON ENGLISH PAINTING OF THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY By L. M. Ayres Among the numerous eighteenth-century benefactions to the Bodleian 6Library was the manuscript collection of the English antiquarian, Bishop Thomas Tanner. Included in his bequest was a twelfth-century psalter (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Tanner 169*), whose calendar and litany have strong connexions with the former Benedictine abbey of St. Werburg at Chester in north-west England.1 Fragments of a Middle English Compassio Mariae with musical notation dating from the second half of the thirteenth century have been bound to the volume as fly-leaves, and for this reason the manuscript has previously attracted the attention of scholars of medieval sacred music.2 The Tanner manuscript also serves as a valuable source for the understanding of artistic developments in England at the end of the twelfth century.3 A series of decorative initials denotes the divisions of the Psalms and an exquisite portrayal of the Crucifixion prefaces the Canon of the Mass which along with other devotional writings follows the Psalms4 (P1. 5a). The text of the manuscript is essentially the work of two scribes. The calendar, psalter proper, litany and a portion of the prayers can be assigned to one hand, whereas a second scribe, perhaps a younger hand, in effect com- pleted the text. The work of the second scribe follows immediately upon that This article is derived from the author's Oxford B.Litt. thesis. The author would like to express his gratitude to his supervisor, Dr. T. S. R. Boase, for his continued encourage- ment with these studies. He has also profited from discussions with Professor Ernst Kitzinger, Dr. Hanns Swarzenski, and Mr. N. R. Ker; and would also like to thank Dr. R. W. Hunt and Dr. J. J. G. Alexander of the Bodleian Library for courtesies extended to him. 1 F.

In the Crucifixion miniature, the figures of Christ, the Virgin, St. John, and the personi- fications of the Sun and Moon are drawn in brown ink. The Cross is edged in red ink and red ink is used to represent the blood issuing from Christ's wounds. The patterned border of the miniature is composed of geometric motifs in red and blue inks, while the back- ground of the scene is covered with a deep blue pigment which has already begun to flake in some areas. It seems questionable whether indeed the Cross operates as the 'T' of the Te igitur of the Canon of the Mass, for the border of the Crucifixion miniature obscures part of what originally appears to have been a small decorative initial, 'T'. Although preliminary drawings for minia- tures were never realized in painting are found in the Winchester Bible, I believe that the artist of the Tanner miniature was content with the effects of his superlative draughtsmanship and had no intention of painting the figures of his composition. 41 4</page><page sequence="2">5 'A %$ 'n'K 10 a? x.J2'A a - Crucifixion.

AYRES of the first and continues through the Canon of the Mass. Both hands seem to rest comfortably within the last quarter of the twelfth century. The calen- dar was written after i i85 as is indicated by the entry on 24 March for the inventio of the bodies of SS. Patrick, Columba, and Bridget.5 The second scribe may have also been responsible for the paschal table which is situated between the calendar and the opening verses of the Psalms. The paschal table extends from i 188 to 1263, and a series of pin pricks has been placed in the cycle just above the entry for A.D. I 193. Bannister and Nicholson accepted these signs as an indication that the paschal cycle was utilized for computistical purposes by that time, 'a row of pin pricks makes it virtually certain that the tables were written between Easter i 192 and Easter i 193 and proves that they were used as early as the later date'.6 In all probability the Tanner manuscript was written and decorated by I 193 and that date may well act as the terminus ante quem for the dating of its Crucifixion miniature. Indeed the style of the draw- ing would support the view that text and illustration were contemporary undertakings, and we shall assume that the Crucifixion miniature is repre- sentative of a trend in English art in the last decade of the twelfth century. The decorative vocabulary of the ornamental Beatus initial of the Tanner psalter is much in keeping with the tradition of English Romanesque painting. The letter 'B' is drawn in brown ink, while the decorative elements are added in blue, red, and green inks (P1. 5b). Rinceaux terminating in acanthus frag- ments which fill the lobes of the initial are found frequently in English painting of the twelfth century. The ends of the stem of the letter open to display flower-like clusters. Similar clusters comprise part of the decoration of the initials of the Winchester and Bury Bibles.7 The same motif (P1. 5c) is also found in another twelfth-century manuscript from St. Werburg's abbey, Chester-a glossed copy of the Pauline Epistles now in the British Museum (Royal MS. 4 E. VIII).8 However, the figure style of the inhabitants of the Crucifixion miniature in our Tanner manuscript exhibits a considerable departure from the behaviour patterns of English Romanesque art as exem- plified by the miniatures of the Bury and Lambeth Bibles and the illustrations by the so-called Master of the Leaping Figures in the Winchester Bible. This change in attitude towards the treatment of form can readily be observed by comparing our Tanner version of the Crucifixion with an un- finished drawing of the same scene (P1. 5d) which adorns a manuscript of Florence of Worcester's Chronicle also in the Bodleian Library9 (MS.

The unfinished Crucifixion drawing was originally executed in pencil, as can be observed if we examine the faint outlines of the Virgin standing to the right of Christ. With re- ference to the figure of Christ, another hand appears to have traced over the original pencil contours in ink. The second hand renders the contours in a somewhat more rigid manner.</page><page sequence="4">TANNER MANUSCRIPT IN THE BODLEIAN 43 297. The Florence of Worcester belonged to the abbey of Bury St. Edmunds, and the illustration of the Crucifixion can be accepted as an English work of the mid-twelfth century (definitely before I 173), at least a generation before our Tanner drawing.10 The figure of Christ in the Florence of Worcester exhibits many of the formal characteristics of Romanesque art in England. His anatomy is rendered in a highly stylized fashion as though it were a wire frame purged of corporeal substance. This schematic diagram of the Saviour, who lacks any impression of existing apart from His position in a lattice-like decorative complex, expresses the Romanesque artist's predilection for an imagery based on a system of abstract formal relationships. The culmination of this ornamental aspect of English Romanesque painting is most clearly seen in the miniatures of the York Psalter (Glasgow University Library, MS. Hunterian U. 3. 2) which probably date from the latter part of the third quarter of the twelfth century.11 By then, such an aesthetic which seemed so fresh a theme in the illustrations of the Bury Bible appears to have more limited horizons, for the process of reducing human activity to an interplay of abstract surface patterns was in danger of becoming merely a repetitive convention. The figure style of the inhabitants of the Tanner version of the Crucifixion scene is indeed another matter. The style of the Tanner artist, like that of the English painter who worked during the late twelfth or early thirteenth centuries at the Aragonese monastery of Sigena, is symptomatic of the tran- sitional era, 'that amazing artistic trend between Romanesque and Gothic which is still in search of a name, but whose profoundly Classical outlook is not in doubt'.12 A comparison between these two drawings in the Bodleian Library displays how greatly the artistic vision of the transitional era differs from that of the Romanesque period in England. The anatomies of the figures in the Tanner miniature are no longer realized as abstract patterns nor are they merely plastic or 'convex', rather they expand in an organic manner. The Tanner artist inherits a viable tradition of visual interpretations of the Crucifixion which was well established by his English predecessors. However, unlike the exponents of Anglo-Saxon and Romanesque illustration in England who promoted a tradition in which the primacy of linear values functioned as the basis of artistic expression, we are dealing with an English draughtsman who in his quest to render more organically intelligible figures has achieved an equilibrium between the linear and plastic properties of his forms. Move- ment and gesticulation on the part of the figures in the Tanner miniature are relegated to a less prominent role in the compositional scheme; the portrayals of the Virgin and the youthful St. John show that the artist is attempting to differentiate between the free and engaged legs in the stances of these figures. Considerable emphasis has been placed upon integrating the horizontal and vertical elements of the human framework into a tectonic harmony. The garments of the Virgin, Christ, and St. John are quite pliant and these soft folds indicate an interest in the distinction between the textures of surfaces. 10 Madan, Summary Catalogue, ii, pp. 383-4, no. 2468; R.

AYRES It is this membranous quality of the surface, proportions which express a harmony of parts, the serene composure of the figures, and the new resilience in the disposal of the limbs and the rendering of the anatomy-these are among the qualities which have invested the atmosphere of the Tanner drawing with its classical impression. Indeed, their attitudes possess much the same 'restraint of emotional factors' which characterizes much of the early thirteenth-century sculpture at Chartres.13 Our medieval draughtsman displays remarkable versatility in the effects he can achieve by the manipulation of line. He renders his version of the personification of the Sun in a somewhat impressionistic manner, while he endows the visage of the Moon with a more formidable countenance which is quite sculpturesque in appeal. His treatment of the locks of hair of St. John reminds us how closely the Tanner artist is verging on naturalistic repre- sentation. We can only speculate concerning the ultimate origins of his style or training. It is certainly more difficult to isolate references to Byzantine artistic canons in his work than in that of the illuminations of the Paris Psalter (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, MS. lat. 8846), the prefatory cycle of minia- tures of the Westminster Psalter (British Museum, Royal MS. 2 A. XXII), and the initials by the so-called Master of the Genesis Initial in the Winchester Bible.14 The facial expressions of the Tanner images lack any resemblance in features or countenance to those of Byzantine art. There are no vestiges of the Byzantine x-shaped folds in the articulation of the drapery folds, whereas these lambda folds survive in miniatures of the Munich Psalter (Munich, Staatsbibliothek, Clm. 835)-15 Nor do we find in our drawing a ready dependence on the products of the continental metalwork ateliers. We do know that there was an interest in champleve' enamels in England, whether these examples be English or con- tinental in origin. This is confirmed by the survival of the enamelled plaques of Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester (I 129-71), which are now preserved in the British Museum.16 As evidenced by the drawings and miniatures of a 13 A.

The question of the existence of a strong tradition of metal- work production in England in the 12th century and whether the art of such ateliers affected the schools of manuscript illumina- tion to a great degree is a subject which deserves considerable attention. Current opinions are at variance. C. Oman, 'In- fluences mosanes dans les 6maux anglais', L'Art Mosan, ed. by P. Francastel, Paris 1953, p. 16o, 'Je crois, par cons6quent, qu'il serait un peu grandiloquent de parler d'une 6cole anglaise de champlev6.'

There also remains the problem of the origin of the</page><page sequence="6">TANNER MANUSCRIPT IN THE BODLEIAN 45 copy of the Moralia in Job at St. Omer (Bibliothbque Municipale, MS. I12), some illustrators of the Channel area were quick to adopt many of the artistic solutions of the Mosan metalworkers and goldsmiths. These volumes, pre- sumably from the abbey of St. Bertin, have been dated towards the end of the twelfth century.17 The artist who created the figure of Eliphaz, Job's arrogant friend, must have experienced direct contact with examples of contemporary metalwork18 (P1. 6b). The contour lines of Eliphaz's mantle have a burin-like precision and sharpness as though they had been actually incised deeply into the parchment of the page, while the lines employed for the interior modelling of the figure have a distinctly angular character. On the other hand, the lines of contour and interior modelling which define the inhabitants of the Tanner miniature are rendered in a less intransigent and more modulated manner. In the Tanner miniature transitions in modelling are achieved in a smoother, more gradual fashion. The Tanner images are endowed with an impression of solidity and corporeal substance which is not surpassed by the St. Omer figures, and the garments of the Virgin and St. John are aligned more in keeping with the force of gravity. It would not seem unreasonable to suggest that the style of the Tanner artist lies outside the orbit of influence of the works of the Mosan masters and Nicholas of Verdun. We can perhaps perceive another instance where an English illuminator was more reluctant than his contemporaries to conform to the artistic con- ventions of the great schools of metalwork which were flourishing during the second half of the twelfth century. This problem leads us to an examination of the miniatures by one of the artists who decorated the so-called Capucins Bible (sometimes termed the St. Bertin Bible) now in Paris (Bibliotheque Nationale, MSS. lat. 16743-46).19 The artist in question was primarily engaged in the decoration of volumes II and IV of this splendid Bible which has been associated with the scriptorium of St. Bertin because the same artist also painted some initials in a psalter which was written between I152 and 1173 for the use of that abbey (Cambridge, St. John's College, Trivulzio Candlestick in Milan, see P. Bloch, 'Siebenarmige Leuchter in Christlichen Kirchen', Wallraf-Richartz-Jahrbuch, xxiii, 1961, pp. 160-62, 187. That a close relation- ship existed between the art of miniature painting and that of metalwork in the Meuse valley in the 12th century has long been recognized. See K. H. Usener, 'Kreuzigungsdarstellungen in der Mosanen Miniaturmalerei und Goldschmiedekunst', Revue Belge d'Arche'ologie et d'Histoire de l'Art, iv, 1934, pp. 201-9, and more recently, J.

M. AYRES MS. 68).20 Another artist who illustrated portions of the Capucins Bible was intimately acquainted with the traditions of Mosan art. His style has been localized to the region of Troyes and it has been suggested that his miniatures for the Bible were completed by I1190.21 The work of the artist with whom we are concerned is perhaps best exem- plified by his illustration of the Tree of Jesse in the Capucins Bible. He also participated in the decorative programme of a glossed copy of the Pauline Epistles from the abbey of St. Albans (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS. 0.5.8) and in that of a Bible which has been affiliated with the same house (Cam- bridge, Corpus Christi College, MS. 48).22 Portions of his designs were apparently copied by another artist who illustrated a copy of the New Testa- ment (Cambridge, St. John's College, MS. I83) which according to a con- temporary inscription was presented to St. Albans by Abbot Simon (1I67-83). We shall then assume that the work of the artist of the Capucins Bible was known in England before i 18323 (Pls. 2c,d). It is beyond the scope of the present study to investigate the sources of the style or the national origin of 20 Art historians have long suggested English antecedents in the work of the artist of volumes ii and iv of the Capucins Bible and we find his work also in the miniatures of a Bible which may well have belonged to St. Albans (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS. 48). The Psalter in St. John's College (MS. 68), contains many liturgical features which are also found in St. Albans manu- scripts, but the calendar is that of St. Bertin usage.

Plummer has noticed that the Genesis initial of the Corpus Christi Bible was produced on a separate piece of vellum. The same Genesis initial has marked affinities with that of the Lambeth Bible, but a similar composition is found in a St. Albans Josephus in the British Museum. See C. R. Dodwell, The Canterbury School of Illumination, io66- 1200oo, Cambridge 1954, p. 50; The Great Lambeth Bible, London 1959, p. 12; O. Pacht, C. R. Dodwell, F. Wormald, The St. Albans Psalter, London 1960, p. I158, n. 3. The resemblance between the illustrations of the Tree of Jesse in the Capucins and Lambeth Bibles has been noted and it has been sug- gested that the iconography may have been transmitted to the Continent when Canter- bury monks migrated to St. Bertin in 1164 during the Becket controversy.

We might gain an insight into this process by comparing an historiated initial in the Capucins Bible which depicts Jeremiah and a miniature in a Radulphus Flaviacensis manuscript in Cambridge (Trinity Hall, MS. 2) which represents Moses24 (Pls. 7a,c). An inscription in the Cambridge book testifies that the book was donated to St. Albans by Abbot Simon (I167-83) and there seems little doubt that the manuscript was written and decorated on English soil. As he raises his arms in an attitude of supplication, the figure ofJeremiah seems almost frozen in awe as he gazes intently towards the Divine hand issuing from Heaven. The groove-like folds ofJeremiah's garments are rendered with a sharp angularity and chiselled crispness which permits us to suspect that the artist had recourse to enamels or other metalwork objects in the formulation of his style.25 The figure of Jeremiah probably formed part of the repertoire of moduli of the 'Capucins' artist from which the illuminator of the St. Albans copy of Radulphus Flaviacensis's Commentary on Leviticus drew inspiration, but a considerable modification has taken place in the pro- cess of the adaptation of the model.26 The artist of Abbot Simon's book has endowed the figure of Moses with a more convincing impression of plastic independence. Moses is revealed as having a more direct, almost conversa- tional, manner in dealing with celestial beings. The artist is defining his forms in more painterly terms. There is little residue of any impression of metallic brittleness in the treatment of the garments, for the drapery folds are expressed in smoother, more flowing lines. We witness in the above com- parison an incipient phase, which intervenes between the 'Capucins' Jeremiah and the 'St. Albans' Moses, of a trend in English painting towards the realization of figures which are invested with an independent plastic existence 24 M. R. James, Catalogue of the Manuscripts in Trinity Hall, Cambridge 1907, pp. 4-5; Boase, O.H.E.A., p. 182. 25 I do not plan at present to deal with the complex problem of the national origin of the 'Capucins' artist or whether indeed his euvre is best understood as an index of a veritable 'Channel School'. We have already observed his work in the Corpus Christi Bible and his probable knowledge of icono- graphical elements which are also found in miniatures which were produced at Canter- bury. The figure ofJeremiah in the Capucins Bible (Pl. 7c) exhibits a marked resemblance to a representation of Moses in a Mosan Josephus (Oxford, Merton College, MS. 317) which has recently been published by W. Cahn, 'An Illustrated Josephus from the Meuse Region in Merton College, Oxford', Zeitschrift ftr Kunstgeschichte, xxix, 1966, pp. 298-9, fig. 2. Cahn has noted that the theme of the Punishment of Korah and his Brethren is treated in a 'similar way' by the artist of the Mosan Josephus and by the 'second' artist of the Capucins Bible whose style has been affiliated by Grodecki with Mosan pro- duction from the region of Troyes. There seems little doubt that the 'Capucins' artist's sources were varied and he was not unaware of Byzantine models. I learned of Professor Cahn's study only after this article had been prepared for publication. 26 For the technique of moduli, F. Deuchler, Der Ingeborgpsalter, Berlin 1967, pp. I25-7. The question may be treated in much the same manner regarding the group of manu- scripts, albeit less securely dated and localized, surrounding the Harley Medical Treatise in the British Museum (Harley MS. 1585).

AYRES less fettered by elements of linear stylization and a proclivity towards treating the surfaces of figures with greater effects of suppleness. These tendencies were quickly brought to fruition at St. Albans in the image of the tetramorph-St. Matthew in the glossed Gospels from that scriptorium27 (P1. 7d; Cambridge, Trinity College, MS. B.5.3). It is generally agreed that the tetramorph-St. Matthew of the glossed Gospels from St. Albans, usually dated about 1200, belongs to the same world of forms as the figures of the prefatory miniatures of the Westminster Psalter.28 Although the Westminster Psalter was obviously written for use at the Bene- dictine abbey of St. Peter at Westminster, there has been some discussion on the part of scholars as to whether the prefatory cycle of five painted minia- tures originated in the same scriptorium. Another group of illustrations, an exquisite series of drawings which may well have been produced as much as fifty years later and were inspired by the tradition of Matthew Paris of St. Albans, were bound with the Westminster Psalter as end fly-leaves at a later date. The incorporation into the manuscript of these drawings, which have been attributed to a follower of Matthew Paris, led James to suspect that the prefatory cycle of miniatures was also affiliated in some manner with the scriptorium of St. Albans.29 The artist of the historiated initial to Psalm CX in a glossed psalter in Cambridge (Corpus Christi College, MS. 75) apparently used the Westminster Psalter version of the Annunciation scene as his model or both artists relied on a common prototype (Pls. 7b,e). The Corpus Christi Psalter unfortunately bears no inscriptions which can aid in localizing and dating the manuscript with any degree of certainty. James, however, noted that the scribe of the Corpus Christi Psalter was probably active in the early thirteenth century and that the text was executed 'in a splendid hand of St. Albans type'.30 Such a palaeographical judgement is far from conclusive and at best provides only a tenuous link for any attempt to localize the production of the manuscript to St. Albans. Notwithstanding such reservations, we cannot neglect noting the resemblance between the imagery of the Annunciation of these two miniatures and perhaps more substantial evidence will eventually come to light to justify James's and Rickert's suggestions that the five miniatures which precede the text of the Westminster Psalter were executed at St. Albans. The style of the Corpus Christi Psalter departs in several important aspects from that of the artist of the Westminster Psalter and foreshadows developments which will occur in English painting as the thirteenth century 27 M.

The Corpus Christi artist's figures have a less monumental and massive bearing, and he endows them with more attenuated proportions. He displays considerable interest in assigning movement a more prominent com- positional role in his portrayal of the Annunciation scene. The effect is com- municated through a more dramatic use of gesture and an elaboration of drapery folds in a manner which produces a rhythmic linear interplay across the surfaces of the figures. The miniatures of the Corpus Christi Psalter as well as those of the Magdalen Psalter31 (P1. 8b,d; Oxford, Magdalen College, MS. ioo) are a prelude to the partiality for linear delicacy and refinement which characterizes later thirteenth-century English miniatures such as those from the Evesham and Amesbury Psalters.32 Schapiro has proposed that the artist of the prefatory miniatures of the Glazier Psalter (New York, Glazier Collection, MS. G. 25) also had a know- ledge of the cycle of the Westminster Psalter or 'a very similar book'.33 He has attributed the full-page miniatures of the Glazier manuscript to a 'London- St. Albans' sphere of the third decade of the thirteenth century.34 The Glazier illustrations serve as a stylistic 'bridge' between the miniatures of the West- minster Psalter and the drawings of Matthew Paris of the second quarter of the thirteenth century when the scriptorium of St. Albans ranked among the most outstanding in Western Europe.35 The achievements of Matthew Paris are also heralded by the beautiful series of tinted drawings in Cambridge (University Library, MS. Kk.4.25) which perhaps more than any other drawings of the early thirteenth century proclaim the innate English sen- sitivity to the potential of line as a means of translating the messages of Biblical episodes into terms of visual expression.36 Hopefully, future research will permit us to localize more securely works such as the Westminster Psalter, the Corpus Christi Psalter, and the tinted drawings in Cambridge. If these works were created within the precincts of St. Albans, they would be monuments of pivotal importance in assessing the complexion of the scriptorium during the interval between the departure of the Alexis Master and the advent of Matthew Paris. If, as Plummer has suggested, the Lothian-Morgan Bible was also decorated at St. Albans, another important artistic current was prevailing there during the early thirteenth century.37 The illustration of the Lothian-Morgan Bible 31 Boase, O.H.E.A., pp. 290-91. 32 D.

M. AYRES (New York, Morgan Library, MS. 791), according to Plummer, was not probably begun before the end of the first decade of the thirteenth century. The Lothian-Morgan style, as best exemplified by the gigantic frontispiece to the Book of Genesis, bears little resemblance to that of the glossed Gospels of St. Albans (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS. B.5.3). The linear contours which embrace the figures are firmer. The artist of the Lothian-Morgan Bible is approaching a more crystalline style in which not only the contours but also the surfaces are beginning to ossify or harden. The folds of the garments are treated in a broader, more angular fashion, while the figures themselves are constructed in a fashion which gives a more blockish or rectilinear impression to the proportions. Although we must be cautious not to place undue emphasis on such an analogy, we might consider the Lothian-Morgan style as a 'mutation' in painting paralleling a similar situation found in the style 'dur'38 or 'Die Tendenz zur Zuriickdringung des Bewegten, zum Einfrieren der Formen',39 which pervades the sculptures of the Coronation portal of the west fagade of Notre-Dame in Paris. Swarzenski has already recognized that the Lothian-Morgan style contains many of the essential ingredients of the art of W. de Brailes, but that leads us to still another chapter in the history of English medieval art.40 Until further researches into liturgical, palaeographical, iconographical and stylistic problems have been conducted, we cannot rest assured that St. Albans was indeed the focal point from which major currents in English painting of the first quarter of the thirteenth century radiated. The multiplicity of artistic impulses which may have existed at St. Albans might for the present be best viewed as something akin to the various sculptural campaigns which adorned the fagades of the French cathedrals of Chartres, Paris, and Reims. We can perhaps approach a better understanding of the position of the artist of the Tanner miniature in the development of Early Gothic art by analogy with contemporary continental production. The Sigena Master, whose English connexions are well known, seemed to have little reservation about putting his talents to use in Spain and presumably studied the mosaics of Norman Sicily.41 Homburger views the artist of the Initial to Isaiah in the Winchester Bible and the painter of the prefatory miniatures of the West- minster Psalter as one and the same master.42 The probable voyages of an 38 L.

Ker has noted that the scribe who 'wrote three supply leaves of the Winchester Bible (fos. 131, 134, - - - 214 and part of fo. 213'v, col. 2)', also made alterations in the text of another 12th-century English Bible (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS.

He further adds, 'This is a fine hand of later type than the main hand of either Bible and is probably not earlier than</page><page sequence="15">TANNER MANUSCRIPT IN THE BODLEIAN 51 artist of the Capucins Bible have been discussed earlier in this paper.43 A close English relative to the style of the Tanner Crucifixion scene is the work of the artist who created the historiated initials which precede the double version of Psalm CX in the Winchester Bible.44 The progressively more corporeal attitude towards the treatment of form on the part of English artists of the last quarter of the twelfth century has long been recognized. It has generally been accepted that this stylistic trend in English painting was greatly indebted to Byzantine models.45 However, when we observe the drawings to Psalm CX in the Winchester Bible, we become aware that the artist is not merely imitat- ing a Byzantine formula of anthropomorphic representation. Although Byzantine types and motifs may have been studied by this master, they have been absorbed, transformed, and re-interpreted into a distinctive Western idiom of expression. Picht's observation that the work of the youngest master of the Winchester Bible shares much of the same spirit as the sculptures of the tympana of the north transept of Chartres is quite compelling46 (P1. 8a,c). Certainly the inhabitants of the preliminary drawings to Psalm CX exhibit the same 'gravite et le calme souverain des visages, cette sorte d'immobilite I 170.' Ker, English Manuscripts in the Century after the Norman Conquest, p. 52; F. Wormald, English Historical Review, lxxvii, 1962, p. 721. Rickert and Roosen-Runge in their publica- tions have designated that the initial to Isaiah is found on fol. 131 of the Winchester Bible. The artist responsible for the initial to Isaiah has been considered by Oakeshott to have been the 'latest Master, here named the Master of the Gothic Majesty', who de- corated the Winchester Bible.

The newly uncovered wall paintings in the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre of Winchester Cathedral when compared with the Sigena frescoes, minia- tures in the Winchester and Bodleian (MS. Auct. E. infra 2, fol. 2) Bibles, and the Morgan leaf in New York will doubtless enhance our understanding of the Winchester milieu during the era. See O. Demus, Romanische Wandmalerei, Munich 1968, pp. 85, 173-4, colour pl. lxxx, and the report by Eve and Robert Baker, 'Paintings in the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre', Winchester Cathedral Record, no. 36, 1967, pp. 2 I1-25. 43 This seems even more understandable in light of the fact that Abbot Simon of St. Albans employed professional scribes. See Ker, English Manuscripts in the Century after the Norman Conquest, pp. 3, I1. The 'Capucins' artist evidently contributed miniatures to one of Abbot Simon's books, now at Stony- hurst College, MS. 10; see Boase, O.H.E.A., p. 182.

Our Tanner drawing is another instance of that antiquisant phase en- countered in the work of transitional artists who had not entirely liberated themselves from the highly formalized conventions of Romanesque painting and yet display remarkable dedication in their search for naturalistic repre- sentation. By this, we mean that although our figures are certainly of human variety, their proportions are still regulated by an abstract order of internal co-ordinates. This interplay between the acceptance and rejection of reality is the catalyst which incorporates an idealist tenor into the atmosphere of the Tanner miniature. Just as the artist of the Winchester Bible asserted his independence from any Byzantine prototype, so too we must accept the formal solution of the Tanner artist as a departure from previous Western and non- Western models. In the stylistic development of English painting at the end of the twelfth century, we view the Tanner artist's accomplishment as some- thing akin to that of the sculptural atelier of Sens, 'Vers 1200, la sculpture de I'lle-de-France avait atteint un palier tel que l'assimilation presque totale d'un module antique 6tait devenue possible ....' S48 The artist of the Tanner drawing has reclaimed the essential formal com- ponents of classical representations without becoming a victim to a process of slavish imitation. His illustration appears to have no ancient counterpart and is fitted into a medieval framework of Christian iconography. The classicism of the Tanner miniature, the Westminster Psalter, and the Winchester Bible does not emerge as a spontaneous outburst but rather as the outcome of a trend towards more naturalistic representation which pervaded English paint- ing of the last quarter of the twelfth century and in which the so-called premier art gothique of the Continent seemed to have played little part. Con- sequently, the term 'classical revival' here refers to an intrinsic recovery, undoubtedly with the assistance of Byzantine art, in English painting of many of the formal properties which are characteristic to the art of the ancient world. As Panofsky has noted with reference to a bronze statuette of the Mater dolorosa (P1. 8e, probably North French, c. 12oo00) now in Freiburg, 'It is, however, significant that just those figures which are the nearest to classical antiquity in spirit.., are often the most difficult to derive from any specific model. The most accomplished of these medieval sculptors had learned to master the language of classical art to the extent that they no longer needed to borrow individual phrases or vocables.'49 The figure of the Virgin in the Tanner miniature like the bronze statuette is a response to a shared classical prospect, a response in a medium of expression in which English artists had long excelled. The Freiburg statuette along with the figures of the New Testament 4 L. Grodecki, 'A propos de la sculpture franqaise de I200', Bulletin monumental, cxv, 1957, p. 124. 48 W.

There seems to be little doubt that the illuminators of the Inge- borg Psalter, contemporaries of our Tanner artist and the foremost exponents of the antiquisant phase in manuscript illumination on the Continent, were inspired by this reservoir of classical forms produced by the goldsmiths of the Meuse area as well as being influenced by Byzantine art.51 On the other hand, the illustrator who created the Crucifixion scene in the Tanner manuscript evokes in a most articulate manner the continued vitality of English manu- script illumination during the twelfth century and exemplifies the capacity of English painters to generate and sustain a classical revival apart from con- tinental developments along the same direction. Continental models either in metalwork, sculpture or painting do not appear to have been significant factors in the stylistic development in English painting during the transitional era.52 English artists were more disposed towards exploiting and absorbing non-Western Byzantine models to achieve similar ends and transformed Byzantine prototypes into their own Western idioms of expression.53 The Tanner artist probably had little knowledge of artistic developments at Sens or Chartres or the accomplishments of the bronze casters and gold- smiths of the region of the Meuse and the Lower Rhineland. He arrived at his solution in an independent manner, assimilating any foreign influences so completely as to force them to conform to the dictates of his own style, and yet he shares in that common stream of immanent stylistic development which 50 S.

Regarding the so-called Masters of the Genesis Initial and of the Amalakites, Pacht has noted, 'Their pictorial narrative is distinguished by a note of almost explosive dramatic fervor, a dynamic temper which has no difficulty in associating itself with the very Insular restlessness of the preceding stylistic phase.' Picht, Burlington Magazine, pp. 171-2. Weitzmann's investi- gations have also provided understanding concerning the nature of this problem. K. Weitzmann, 'Eine spatkomnenische Ver- kiinigungsikone des Sinai und die zweite byzantinische Welle des I2. Jahrhunderts', Festschrift fir Herbert von Einem, Berlin 1965, pp. 299-312. With reference to the Master of the Genesis Initial, will it eventually be possible for art historians to distinguish be- tween the elements in his miniatures which can be assigned to a survival or revival of an indigenous, insular tradition and those which may be credited to the influence of the Late Comnenian 'baroque' phase with which scholars of Byzantine art have recently been concerned? Further study of the miniatures of the Winchester Bible should permit us to chart more precisely the path which leads to the classical outlook of the master of the initials to Psalm cx. O.

AYRES the artists of north-west Europe were experiencing at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries, the crucial decades for the emergence of the Early Gothic style in the figurative arts. At this time the artists of north-west Europe seemed more in accord with reference to formal matters than they had been during the Romanesque period. Fortunately, the Tanner manuscript is securely localized by the internal evidence of the manuscript. If this were not the case, I believe scholars would have less difficulty approximating a date for the miniature than in determining the nationality of the artist.54 Perhaps we might also understand these ennobled forms which may well derive from the artistic environment of a monastic 'closed shop' as a culmination in visual terms of the humanistic threads which penetrated much of twelfth-century theological speculation. .4 One cannot help but recall one of Pacht's observations concerning the characteristics of the International Gothic Style of 1400oo, 'In der Regel sehen wir zunichst, dass ein Bild oder eine Skulptur von 1400oo ist, und dann erst, dass es sich um ein franzosisches, lombardisches oder b6hmisches Werk handeln dirfte; und haufig muss diese zweite Frage unentschieden bleiben.' O. Pacht, 'Die Gotik der Zeit um 14oo als Gesamteuropaische Kunstsprache', Euro- pdische Kunst urn z4oo, Exhibition Catalogue, Vienna I962, pp. 53-54. Has not the Trivulzio Candlestick already become the 'Wilton Diptych' of artistic production in Europe during the years around 1200? We cannot completely exclude the possibility that the Tanner illustrator was a travelling artist. Little is known about artistic produc- tion in north-west England at Chester during the 12th century, but there does not appear to have been any flourishing school of manuscript illumination. The number of surviving 12th-century manuscripts from the Benedictine abbey of St. Werburg at Chester is rather meagre, see Ker, Medieval Libraries of Great Britain, pp. 49-50.</page></plain_text>
