<plain_text><page sequence="1">170 DECEMBER-JANUARY The Cult Places of the Aegean. By BOGDAN RUTKOWSKI. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986. Pp. 267, ill. 315. $35.00. When this book appeared in its first edition in 1972, it was quite useful. It could be used as a supplement to M. P. Nilsson's The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and Its Survival into Greek Religion (19502) because it contained a fairly complete list of cult places hitherto excavated as well as an updated bibliography. The new edition by Yale University Press, despite its attractive appearance, has little new to offer. In the meantime, studies more detailed than Rutkowski's have appeared, notably the dissertations of L. Tyree on caves and G. Gesell's on Minoan house shrines. (The latter has recently been published as a monograph in the SIMA series, Sweden, with the title Town, Palace and House Cult in Minoan Crete.) Meth- odologically, new ground has been broken in the field of Aegean religion which the author does not consider. Nor is the book updated bibliographically. It is regrettable that in a work published in 1986 there is little account taken of scholarship after 1981. Even older articles, sometimes of crucial importance, are ignored. Thus, in interpreting frescoes from Knossos, R. does not take into account the work of M. Cameron; a fresco from the Cult Center of Mycenae, excavated by Lord W. Taylour, is erroneously described (180) because R. has missed Taylour's article in Antiquity 1970. As the author in effect himself states in the preface, the only recent work that he builds upon is his own. There are many misprints (a curious one in the notes, p. 239, n. 88, attributes J. T. Hooker's Mycenaean Greece to W. Burkert!). There are also peculiar transliterations. Why "Ieraklion" instead of "Herakleion"? The book contains many illustrations and plans as well as useful updated catalogues in the end of many chapters, including an addendum on Anemospilia (here there is indeed improvement over the previous edition). Yet, the plans are not always well chosen, nor do they help the reader make sense out of the descriptions in the text. The rooms or areas discussed in the text are not marked or clearly defined on the plans. Sometimes there are references to room numbers in the text which do not exist on the plans. For example, on Fig. 19, plan of Chamaizi, room 2, near which figurines were found, is not indicated (145); nor is room I on Fig. 245, Temple at Kea. This edition contains several new reconstructions of peak-sanctuaries based on the author's ideas. Although attractive, these restorations with tripartite facades are by no means warranted by the existing archaeological evidence. One of the problems of the work concerns classification. This is evident already in the contents. R. divides the material into natural and urban sanctuaries. There are chapters on Crypts, Caves, Peak Sanctuaries, Sacred Enclosures in Crete, Cretan sanctuaries in Towns and settlements, Neolithic and Minoan temples, Mycenaean temples, Natural sanctuaries on the Greek Mainland and nearby islands, Domestic sanctuaries in Mainland Greece. Notable is the virtual absence of Akrotiri (Thera) and the palace of Zakros from the discussions, which is regrettable given the fact that it is precisely from these sites that a wealth of information has been obtained since 1972. Still, this classification could have been a good starting point for dealing with a vast material had it not been for certain peculiar associations. Why are Minoan temples in the same chapter as Neolithic mainland shrines? Why mix chronological and regional variables? For example, in the discussion of Minoan Pillar Crypts, suddenly a Mycenaean one appears (28) without any comment as to why a purely Minoan architectural type should be found on the mainland. (Indeed one suspects that the</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 171 alleged crypt is simply a room with a pillar.) Or, in connection with the development of cult statues in Minoan Crete, evidence from Early Bronze Age Cyprus is adduced. One also wonders why Xeste 3 at Akrotiri on Thera should be discussed in connection with sanctuaries in Mainland Greece when R. himself says that the cult practices of Thera are Minoan in character (221). Another problem is the criteria used by the author for identifying shrines. R. proposes to adhere to strict rules. His only safe criterion is the presence of cult objects and votives, not architecture. He thus rejects the sanctity of many Pillar Crypts because they were empty of finds. "Lustral Basins" may have had a sacred character; most likely, they were used for ritual ablutions (131). Here we run into problems, for if the presence of cult objects is the only safe criterion for shrine identification, then many a Greek temple or Christian church, found without cult equipment, would not qualify as a sacred building. In the reviewer's opinion, architecture constitutes a criterion of primary importance for determining the sanctity of a room. R's way of reasoning can result in two different misconceptions. On the one hand, you risk not recognizing real shrines, on the other, you will designate as shrines storerooms or repositories in which cult symbols and paraphernalia were just stored before the festivals. To return to Pillar Crypts and "Lustral Basins" (the latter erroneously so designated by Evans in the reviewer's view), it is noteworthy that these two types are among the very few architecturally well-defined units in Minoan Crete. It is reasonable to assume that they were used consistently in the same manner regardless of whether cult objects were found in all cases. It suffices that sacred objects existed in a fair number of cases. One has to make sense out of the pattern that emerges. Another criterion that R. uses for shrine identification is the presence of cult images. This is a peculiar choice indeed, given the virtual absence of anthropomorphic cult statues in palatial Crete. Whether one believes, with R. and others, that they did exist but have vanished from the archaeological record, or that the Minoans had no use for them in palatial times - as the reviewer does - one thing is certain: one cannot use such an ambiguous criterion either to prove or to disprove the sacred character of a room. Nor can one assume that a cult image must have been included in a given shrine (161). A serious omission among the criteria used by R. to identify shrines is the use of frescoes, especially the ones that have clearly religious iconography. Even more unsatisfactory are the author's definitions. There is a consistent lack of operational definitions--what did actually go on?--which would help us visualize cult practices and might explain variations in architectural form. What is the essential difference between R's "temples" and "palatial shrines" in Crete? Both can be said to have a public character, neither conforms to a standard plan. The idea of the Minoan and Mycenaean temple seems a very unsatisfactory one in general. R's discussion suffers from the additional problem of grouping together buildings from all periods from the Neolithic to Sub-Minoan times. Surely the types of sanctuaries must have changed to meet the needs of a developing society. The definition of "sacred enclosures" is unsatisfactory as well. R. associates them with certain scenes depicted on rings and thinks they are rural shrines. Yet this is not really supported by the iconographical evidence. The cult scenes on these rings (from Archanes, Vapheio, Mycenae, etc.) do not seem to be taking place in a rural setting. Paved platforms and constructions in ashlar masonry are indicators of an urban or at least urban-controlled environment. Moreover, why would rural cults be depicted on gold rings which expressed the ideology and identity of the upper classes? Altars compose one of the most confusing categories. Under this name, the author classifies hearths (159), pits, bonfires, stone tables and built constructions decorated with spirals (228). All these are functionally different entities; by calling them altars one invites confusion and the inevitable question "what is an altar?"</page><page sequence="3">172 DECEMBER-JANUARY R. tries to draw some socio-economic conclusions. Having reviewed the evidence of palatial, urban and natural sanctuaries, and having reduced palatial ones to an absolute minimum without any good reason, the author arrives at the following conclusion. The lack of monumental sacred architecture in the Aegean, he states, must mean that the principal cult places were located in the country. But if that is the case, where is the evidence for this rural monumental architecture? With the exception of Juktas and a few other isolated cases, like Anemospilia, there does not seem to be any in Crete. What is more, it is a priori unlikely that a "Hochkultur" with sophisticated palatial and urban centers would not have had monumental religious architecture in its settlements. One would have wished that the author had discussed possible ethnographic parallels for this phenomenon. As things stand, it is perhaps a more useful approach to look for monumental religious architecture in the already known structures, namely the palaces. The abundance of religious iconography in the frescoes from the palace of Knossos and the large amount of cult equipment recovered in all the palaces and most notably Zakros make this hypothesis more than likely. Finally, the projective or belief system: although the author says very little about cult practices, he does make an attempt to reconstruct the deities of the Creto-Mycenaean world-the most difficult of all subjects of Aegean religion. A war god is identified at Arkalochori because of the large number of swords found there. However, votive objects sometimes tell more about the identity of the donor than the deity venerated. We must therefore be cautious about such inferences. Aniconic forms of the divinities are assumed in the shape of columns or poles--why this should be so, we are not told, except that similar ideas were postulated by Evans in 1901. Further, R. identifies a virgin goddess at Phylakopi (184, 185), an elderly goddess at Asine (219) and Tiryns (189), unfortunately without supporting arguments. The reader is left bewildered at such startling conclusions arrived at by impressions rather than a systematic analysis of the iconography. Linear B texts are rarely mentioned. In conclusion this is a disappointing book from the point of view of method and approach despite its richness in contents. One hopes that the forthcoming detailed studies in museums and the field conducted by the author will be more promising. NANNO MARINATOS Swedish Institute, Athens</page></plain_text>
