Altering socio-cultural beliefs hindering the learning of science OLUGBEMIRO J. JEGEDE1, BARRY J. FRASER2 &amp; PETER AKINSOLA OKEBUKOLA3 Distance Education Centre, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD 4350, Australia; 2Science and Mathemtics Education Centre, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, WA 6001, Australia; 3 Faculty of Education, Lagos State University, PMB 1087, Apapa, Lagos Nigeria (Accepted 24 September, 1993) Abstract Recent studies in educational productivity and effectiveness of schooling have shown that certain factors could be altered within the classroom to result in enhanced achievement and positive attitude towards the study of science. A learner who is not positively disposed to, or has a socio-cultural background that is indifferent to the learning of science would find it hard to learn science effectively. If, as suggested by recent research, the socio-cultural characteristics which children in non-western society bring into the classroom from their environment create a wedge between what they are taught and what they learn, it is plausible to hypothesise that school based alterations of the socio-cultural prior knowledge of the learner could result in school effectiveness. This study attempted to determine whether or not instruction based on a socio-cultural model could significantly alter students' attitudes towards the learning of and achievement in science. The sample consisted of 600 senior secondary year one students (442 boys, 156 girls) from 15 secondary schools in Nigeria. The Socio-Cultural Environment Scale (SCES) and the Biology Achievement Test (BAT) were used to measure the change in attitude and achievement of subjects respectively in a pretest - posttest situation after a six-week treatment. Evidence was found from the study to support the hypothesis that science instruction which deliberately involved the discussion of socio-cultural views about science concepts altered students' attitudes toward the study of science. The finding also indicated that some socio-cultural factors were amenable to alterations in such a way as to promote the subjects' positive attitudes towards the study of science. Introduction The upsurge of research into school effectiveness and school improvement in contemporary times reinforces the basis for all educational practices and innovation. The multifarious and global nature of factors and predictors of school effectiveness, as expected, have necessitated the formulation of a number of models of school effectiveness. Notable among these models are the five factor model of Edmonds (1979), the multi-level conceptual model of Scheerens &amp; Stoel (1988), Hattie's model and Walberg's model of educational productivity (Walberg 1981).</page><page sequence="2">138 Although there does not appear to be a consensus on what constitutes impor tant characteristics of effective schooling (Teddlie, Stringfield, Wimpelberg &amp; Kirby 1989; Good &amp; Brophy 1987), it seems that achievement outcomes are among the central aspects of school effectiveness (Fraser 1989). Recent studies and views about judging the effectiveness of schooling point to the need to use information from the anthropological and cognitive aspects of both the environment within and outside the classroom (Comaroff 1982; Lave 1988; Jegede 1987; Jegede &amp; Okebukola 1989; Jegede &amp; Fraser 1989). Whereas most models of school effectiveness list home environment as predictor of achievement in schools, only Walberg's model comes close to mentioning certain aspects of out-of-class environmental factors. Wal berg's model, with nine factors of productivity grouped into student aptitude, instructional variables, and educationally stimulating psychological environ ment variables, seems to enjoy the widest usage and acceptance based on its generalisability, consistency and potency in terms of measuring school effectiveness (Fraser 1989). A recent secondary analytic study testing the validity of Walberg's productivity model (Fraser, Walberg, Welch &amp; Hattie 1987) and other meta-analyses uphold this view regarding the efficacy of Walberg's model. However the model omits the socio-cultural aspects of the learner's out of-school environment which bear relationship to what and how the learner develops science concepts in the classroom. For learners of science in non western cultures, these aspects have profound effects on their disposition to and proficiency in science learning (Erickson 1986; Ogunniyi 1988; Snively 1989; Prophet 1990; Okebukola &amp; Jegede 1990; Jegede &amp; Okebukola 1991; Swift 1992). Indeed, since every society educates the younger generation as a means of passing down the socio-cultural attributes of its people, the socio-cultural fac tors within non-western societies become a composite part of the environment and, therefore, control to a very large extent what a child in such an environ ment learns and becomes in later life. Since every human 'tends to resolve puzzles in terms of the meanings available in a particular socio-cultural envi ronment, the baseline is that the meanings become firmly implanted in the cognitive structure and manifest themselves habitually and may act as tem plates, anchors or inhibitions to new learning' (Ogunniyi 1988). Several people have alluded to the fact that culture has a lot to do with achievement differences in school work (Boas 1911; Horton 1964; Hoebel 1965; Erickson 1984). With respect to school science learning, Bajah (1975), Ehindero (1982); Ogunniyi (1982), Driver (1979), Kay (1975), Johnson (1970), Jegede (1987), Okebukola &amp; Jegede (1987) and Jegede &amp; Okebukola</page><page sequence="3">139 (1988, 1989) have attributed the deficiency in c.~ience achievement and the attainment of excellence to the mediating effects of socio-cultural factors. The call for students to illuminate the role which socio-cultural factors play in science learning in non-western cultures has led to the identification and isolation of five main factors: authoritarianism, goal structure, African world view, societal expectation and sacredness of science (Jegede 1987; Jegede &amp; Okebukola 1988). These factors relate to (i) the general environment in which the learner spends most of his/her time (authoritarian/democratic), (ii) goal structure preference for cooperative, competitive or individualistic work, (iii) the reasoning pattern dictated by the traditional society (empirical or mythi cal), (iv) the nature of interaction within a communal society and its influence on the success of an individual (societal expectation), and (v) the knowl edge system within a traditional society which regards science as magical, weird and something special. Jegede &amp; Okebukola (1988, 1989) found in their studies that authoritarianism, African world-view, societal expectation and sacredness of science had negative effects, while goal structure exerted a positive effect on the learning of science in Nigerian classrooms. The obvious implication of the above is that, regardless of how adequate the conditions for teaching science are in our classrooms, the socio-cultural characteristics which children bring into the class from their environment might create a wedge between what they are taught and what they learn. If the recent worldwide developments in science education have really not contributed significantly to effective science learning (Novak 1988), it may well be that for learners within non-western environments, socio-cultural influences might be an extra source inhibiting effective learning. Several calls have been made (Abdullahi 1982; Ukoli 1985; Bajah 1986; Black 1984; Ogawa 1985; Ogunniyi 1986; and Jegede &amp; Okebukola 1988) for science instruction that would (a) structure the classroom environment in a way that the cultural variables of the learner could be utilised to greatest benefit, and (b) recognise the characteristics of the learner's socio-cultural background that might serve as a blockage to fruitful learning of science concepts. Fraser (1989) has found that there are numerous school-alterable factors which could be worked upon in the classroom to improve the achievements and attitudes of science students. Some of these factors include motivation, quality of instruction, the class environment and the amount of television viewing. The implications that these have for improving educational pro ductivity and school effectiveness lead to the need to find out if certain socio-cultural factors could be altered through instruction within the science classroom to motivate the learning of science within a non-western envi</page><page sequence="4">140 ronment where the out-of-school environment exerts tremendous impact on attitude and level of achievement in science. Learning leads to a change in behaviour and attitudes. A learner who is not positively disposed to or has a socio-cultural background that is indifferent to learning science in the classroom would find it difficult, if not impossible, to learn science effectively. Science, as a way of knowing, is contextual and based on a Western world-view which mechanically looks at the world from an inductive methodology and ascribes ontological status of reality to ideas. This world-view contrasts with the African world-view in which the world is perceived as holistic with no epistemological separation between a cognising person and the object to be learned. The indigenous world view professes a strong and intimate link of people to the natural world in which theories and myths are based on an anthropomorphic model. A serious implication of the above is that students bring to science classes knowledge derived from their world-view as the basis for understanding the science taught in the classroom (Jegede 1994a). The epistemological framework based on the anthropomorphism African students bring into the science classroom often creates cognitive problems which need to be addressed for them to meaningfully learn science. If as has been presented above what students learn in a science classroom is governed by the particular world-view held by the learner, then it is neces sary to provide empirically based information on the influence of specifically tailored instruction on the socio-cultural attitudes of learners (Jegede &amp; Oke bukola 1990). Gender inequality in science has received a lot of attention in contemporary literature (Keller 1983; Koballa 1988; Tuckey 1992) and requires a solid basis on which changes can be made in teaching and learning (Tobin 1988). The view that education takes place within a socio-cultural environment has implications for the way gender and formal schooling are perceived. Differences in achievement between males and females in school science in a non-western environment such as Nigeria might be linked to societal and cultural inequality where woman's position is thought to be in the kitchen and the baby factory, and almost entirely subservient to men (Jegede &amp; Inyang 1990; Jegede &amp; Okebukola 1992). Finding solutions to the double disadvantage - both socio-cultural and science culture - females face in a non-western environment requires an understanding of the basis of the problems, especially from a socio-cultural attitudinal perspective. Therefore investigating, if gender has any significant relationship with students' socio cultural attitudes towards the study of science in a non-western culture would be a way to begin the search for such solutions. If it is agreed that whatever students learn in a science classroom is done through socio-cultural filters,</page><page sequence="5">141 then it is necessary to provide empirically based information on the influence of specifically-tailored instruction on the socio-cultural attitudes of learners (Jegede &amp; Okebukola 1990). A search in the literature indicates that little has been done in this area. The provision of such potentially valuable data motivated this study. Statement of problem School effectiveness and proficiency in learning are in the main judged by achievement outcomes. Effective science learning is measured in schools through a number of ways in which a student is required to demonstrate the comprehension and application of science principles and facts. For instance, a student must accept science as the authoritative knowledge, rigorously apply the method of science, and regard science as the major way of acquiring objective knowledge of the world. A learner with a non-western background who comes to learn science within the Western framework would need a re orientation of his/her socio-cultural attitudes in order to 'fit' into the science culture taught in the classroom. This study therefore attempts to determine whether or not instruction based on a socio-cultural model could significantly alter students' attitude towards the learning of, and achievement in, science. Specifically, the study sought answers to these questions: (a) Would instruction in selected science concepts using the socio-cultural mode significantly alter students' attitude to the learning of, and achieve ment in, science? (b) Which socio-cultural factors are school-alterable through specifically tailored instruction of selected science concepts? (c) Has gender any significant relationship with students' socio-cultural atti tudes towards the study of science in a non-western culture? Methodology Subject A total of 600 students (442 boys, 158 girls) of senior secondary year one (grade 10 level) from 15 secondary schools in Nigeria served as the subjects for the study. These schools are located in 12 out of the 30 states of the Federation. The choice of the 15 schools used was purposive. Volunteer teachers drawn from a group of long-vacation-term degree students who were in their final term at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria used their schools</page><page sequence="6">142 for the experiment. The 15 teachers, who had taught biology for at least five years each, were in their final year of work in a B.Sc. Education program offered over a period of four long vacations. A request for volunteers was made to the students by the senior author after explaining the purpose of the research and stating the conditions of the study. These conditions included (a) that the teacher must have taught biology at the high school level for a continuous period of at least five years, and (b) a willingness on the part of the volunteer teacher to reorganise the scheme of work and syllabus according to the design of the study for the term during which the study would be conducted. In each school, two classes of the senior secondary year on (grade level 10) were selected by a random sampling technique and assigned as experimental and control groups respectively. The total number of subjects in each of the experimental and control groups for the study was 300 students. The senior secondary year one (grade level 10) was used for the study because the biology topic chosen was part of the syllabus for that academic year. Instrumentation The data were collected using the Socio-Cultural Environment Scale (SCES) developed and validated by Jegede &amp; Okebukola (1988). The validation of the instrument went through a series of stages using a panel of science educators, science teachers, sociologists and anthropologists to determine its construct and content validity. The SCES is a 30-item instrument with the five subscales of : authoritarianism, goal structure, African world-view, societal expectations and sacredness of science. Respondents were asked to indicate their agreement with each item on the SCES by a choice of 'never', 'sometimes' or 'often' on a 3-point scale scored as 1,2 and 3. Negative items had their scores reversed in like manner. The alpha reliability coefficient for the five subscales of the SCES determined for the experimental sub-sample of the study ranged from 0.88 to 0.98. Examples of the 30 items on the SCES instrument are as follows: Traditional world-view 'Traditional beliefs have scientific explanations.' 'Traditional beliefs hinder the learning of science.' 'What is learnt in science relates to day-to-day life experiences.'</page><page sequence="7">143 Sacredness of science 'The way science explains the world is strange to me.' 'The way science explains the world conflicts with what I already believe.' The Biology Achievement Test (BAT), consisting of 50 multiple-choice items assembled from standardised past question papers of the West African Exam ination Council, was administered to provide a covariate for the analysis of attitude change. The items on the BAT were all based on the subtopics on mammalian reproduction taught during the six weeks experiment. The reli ability coefficient of the BAT using the Spearman-Brown split-half method was found to be 0.79. Design and procedure A pretest - posttest experiment with random assignment of subjects to the experimental and control groups in each school, using the class as a unit, was used to examine any possible treatment effect due to exposure to the socio-cultural teaching mode. In addition to the collection of quantitative data from the subjects on the experimental effect of the instructional intervention, individual interviews with a subset of the experimental subjects were conducted to provide a com prehensive and richer picture of just what is happening in terms of changes in socio-cultural beliefs of the students. A total of 18 students (10 males and 8 females) in the experimental group of two senior secondary schools were interviewed by the senior author. The interviews with individual students lasted from 20 to 35 minutes depending on the details of their responses. Interviews were partially open ended and were guided by some structured interview questions. One of the major determinants of the choice of questions was an attempt to zero in on their attitude change vis-a-vis their socio-cultural views about the biological concepts they were taught. The interview protocol therefore included such questions as: 1. Did you find the lessons different from what you were used to? If so, give reasons for your answer. 2. Would you prefer your teacher to continue with this method of teaching biology concepts. 3. Mention the things that you like very much with the method your teacher used in teaching the biology concept.</page><page sequence="8">144 The responses of the students to these and other questions were analysed and have been incorporated in the discussion of the results. Fifteen biology teachers enrolled for the long-vacation-term degree course at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria participated in the experiment. The teachers, who were all in their final year of the part-time study, spent two weeks with the senior author as an orientation period preparing for the study. The two-week period afforded the teachers the opportunity to discuss and learn in detail what socio-cultural factors are and what their effect is on science learning; to become familiar with the SCES; to understand the rationale and the details of the proposed experiment; to make a choice and then go through the syllabus topic to be used with the treatment; and to learn how to teach the topic using the socio-cultural model. Three micro-teaching sessions with two demonstration period of 40 minutes in a nearby senior secondary school were also used to supplement the teachers' preparation for entry into the research situation. After some discussion between the volunteer teachers and the senior author, the syllabus topic of mammalian reproduction was unanimously chosen as suitable for the experiment mainly because it is one of the topics which children are not normally allowed by elders to discuss freely at home and because it would arouse great enthusiasm. In the 15 schools, both the experimental and the control groups had instruc tion on the same subtopic related to mammalian reproduction for a period of six weeks by the 15 teachers who participated in the study. The topic was bro ken down into the sub-topics of (a) what a mammal is (b) the male reproductive system (c) the female reproductive system (d) fertilisation, implantation and gestation and (e) birth, parental care and birth control. To aid the teaching, rabbits were dissected for the study of the reproductive systems while opaque projectors were used to show the development stages of the foetus in addition to the construction of models of the foetal stages by the students under teacher guidance. In the experimental group, the treatment consisted of instruction in the sub-topics which also incorporated planned discussions of the socio-cultural beliefs related to biological ideas and concepts. This was done for about a quarter of every teaching period to determine its validity in relation to what was learned in the biology lessons during the treatment. The discussions in the treatment group focussed on the analysis of the major concepts of the lessons and what the beliefs in the society about the concept are. The class was guided by the teacher to evaluate the traditional beliefs in the light of the information presented in the biology lessons. The subjects were encouraged to question further the basis for these beliefs in relation to the tradition of science. Examples of these beliefs are: (a) an uncircumcised expectant mother</page><page sequence="9">145 would not give birth safely. (In some African societies women are normally circumcised before marriage or just before delivery. This is ostensibly to appease the gods to allow safe delivery of babies.) (b) mating in the daytime gives rise to an albino, (c) A pregnant woman who sweeps in the night will give birth to a deformed baby. The discussion format followed a non-threatening democratic class atmosphere to get students to discuss each biological topic and its related traditional belief. The discussion involved the isolation of scientific thinking or social deterrence associated with the content of the topic being studied. For an example, a discussion about the belief that 'a pregnant woman who sweeps in the night will give birth to a deformed baby' led students to examine all scientific and social/health reasons behind it. Students get to appreciate that the daily chores of a woman in the African context are laborious enough without having to add to them the need to cope with pregnancy. By the end of the day a pregnant woman would have exhausted herself to the extent that all she requires and needs at night time is complete rest. Probably the most effective way of getting her to take the rest is to scare her with a belief she can identify with in her pregnant condition. Indeed, the students get to realise that this socially motivated health-related belief checks the possible harm the state of over work of a pregnant woman could bring to bear on the unborn baby. The idea in the class was to lead students to reconcile scientific facts with cultural thoughts and beliefs where possible and for them in the classroom situation to deduce that the scientific content of the topic being studied is not necessarily opposed to the traditional belief related to it in some manner. This procedure was used only when the teacher had to teach the specified topics to the experimental group. The procedure strictly follows the training the teachers received during the two week preparation period while they were resident on campus. The socio-cultural mode was not used for the control subjects. Instead, instruction followed the expository strategy in which the subtopics were taught strictly in compliance with the teaching notes of the syllabus. At the end of the treatment period, both the experiment and control subjects were given an equivalent of a two-and-a-half-hour review of what had been taught during the period of the experiment. This was followed by the adminis tration of the SCES and BAT instrument to all the subjects as posttests (in the same way as the pretest was administered to them before the treatment). The administration of the SCES posttest was delayed for a period of six weeks after the treatment to check whether the students' attitude reverted back to the original state before the treatment. The administration of the pretest and posttests was done during a normal lesson period of 40 minutes each. The average times taken by all the subjects to complete the instruments were 34 minutes (SCES) and 30 minutes (BAT) respectively.</page><page sequence="10">146 Table 1.

The t-test carried out on the mean posttest SCES scores however indicated that the experimental group subjects (with a mean score of45.72) developed significantly more positive attitudes than their control group counterparts who obtained a mean score of 34.34 [t(598) = 9.25, p &lt; 0.01], Similarly, the t-test analysis on the posttest biology achievement test mean scores of the two groups indicated that the experimental group achieved significantly better (mean = 29.0) than the control group [t(598) = 7.01, p&lt; 0.01]. Analysis of variance was carried out to compare the differences in posttest scores of the control and experimental groups in each of the five subscales of the SCES. The results as shown in Table II indicated that the differences for three subscales of Authoritarianism, African World-view and Sacredness of Science attained significance (p &lt; 0.01). In order to further confirm the existence of the significant treatment effect on, and the magnitude of the change in, socio-cultural attitude of the exper imental group, analyses of covariance using the SCES pretest and the BAT pretest scores as covariates were undertaken. Analysis of covariance adjusts for initial differences between groups and for correlation between means. It also allows for comparison of groups on one variable when information is available on another variable correlated with it (Isaac &amp; Michael 1972). The</page><page sequence="11">147 Table 2.

Significant gender differences were also noticed when achievement scores were used as covariates. The results seem to indicate that the positive change in the socio-cultural attitude of the experimental group as a result of the instruction intervention is very large and significant. Discussion of results The major aim of this study was to investigate if an instructional intervention program could alter students' socio-cultural attitudes towards science learning positively. It also sought to find out which socio-cultural factors are school alterable and if gender has any relationship with the development of the socio</page><page sequence="12">148 cultural attitudes in the learning of science. Experimental evidence obtained in the study indicated that instruction in science deliberately planned to involve discussion of socio-cultural views about science concepts engenders positive socio-cultural attitudes towards the study of science. Some of the students' responses to the interview questions do support this assertion. Examples of some of the typical statements made by a cross-section of the students include the following: '... the discussions about the superstitious beliefs surrounding the biology we learn at school allows us to give our opinions without being afraid'. '... the discussions made me enjoy the lessons more and I was able to learn a lot more from them'. '... my attitude toward what science says about our traditional beliefs is now better'. . I think I learned biology better now. I can see there is no clash between what I learn in school and what my people believe'. A parsimonious explanation for this finding could be that the teaching of sci ence using the socio-cultural mode serves to eliminate the apparent mismatch between the information and ideas brought into the science classroom from the traditional society and the scientific explanation of natural occurrences. In addition, the development of a new attitude begins with a change in a cur rently held attitude. The results of this study therefore reaffirm the efficacy of instruction as a potent tool for attitude and behaviour alteration. It would appear therefore that several other areas of the senior secondary school biology curriculum (for example, topics relating to health and the environment, human physiology, etc.), could be taught this way. Significant among the students' interview responses supporting this view are: '... we should always get a chance to compare the science ideas we learn in school and what our parents tell us at home'. '... the teacher should not use this method to teach only reproduction, he should use it to teach all our biology lessons, and it should begin all the way from the junior secondary school'. An aspect of the finding which opens up a whole new area for further inves tigation and detailed validation is that which indicated that the socio-cultural factors of authoritarianism, African World-view and Sacredness of Science could be altered through deliberate instruction. The finding that some socio cultural factors are school alterable while others are not is quite intriguing. Two salient issues need to be mentioned in relation to them. The fact that the factor of Goal Structure is not alterable could be due to the fact that the competitive/individualistic culture of the classroom as normally practised during science lessons seems to exert a dominating effect. Indeed, learning and teaching of science in an average Nigerian classroom lean towards the</page><page sequence="13">149 competitive mode particularly in relation to examinations (Okebukola 1986). It could well be that in the minds of the students there is a fine line between the class culture and the traditional culture outside the class. They therefore react according to the demands of whichever culture they find themselves in. Similarly, Societal Expectations were found not to have been altered. The reason could be that as part of the cultural upbringing, children in the African environment get to learn what is expected of them, and hence unconsciously incorporate them into their long term memory. One would have expected similar results with the factor of African World-view which in fact indicated that it could be altered significantly in school. The extent of change is not known however and could also support the idea of 'duality of cultures' in the mind of the learner. Could this be an indication that anthropomorphic and mechanistic views can be presented in a way that promotes positive attitudes to the study of science in non-western cultures (Chen &amp; Novik 1984; Zeidler 1984; Ogunniyi 1988)? The findings also show that gender does not significantly relate to students' cultivation of positive attitudes towards the study of science when instructed through the socio-cultural mode. This is interpreted to mean that in spite of the fact that gender issues within the African environment might be another type of socio-cultural conditioning, both males and females benefitted equally from being instructed through the socio-cultural mode. This result appears to indicate that there may be no basis for biological justification of achievement differential among males and females. Although it would appear injudicious on the basis of one sample and other experimental biases to conclude with certainty that instruction through the socio-cultural mode significantly influences students' attitudes towards the . study of science, it does point out its potential, which, as far as we know, has never been investigated previously. A cautious acceptance of the conclusion arising from this study is therefore advised. Some important implications arise from the findings of this research. First, science teachers and curriculum developers need to recognise the role that instruction through the socio-cultural mode might play in the development of positive attitudes towards the learning of science in traditional societies. Second, as suggested in reviews (Novak 1988; Okebukola &amp; Ogunniyi 1984) and contrary to wide belief, the way and manner in which science is being taught in contemporary times provide students with little insight into the process of knowledge construction. It stands to reason that such a novel way of communicating science in a traditional environment may hold some promise. Third, the findings of this study support the Ausubelian (1978) dictum that 'the most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach him accordingly'. This reinforces the</page><page sequence="14">150 need for its incorporation into educational practices and research. Fourth, this study supports the call by Novak (1988) for more research to be carried out to ascertain the relationship between alternative instructional programs and their impact on students' shift toward constructivist views. Fifth, although reliance on the results from a one-shot study like this should be treated with caution, the indication of possible alteration of some socio-cultural factors through the classroom environment is significant for science teaching in non-western environments. It calls for the need to look closely at both the anthropological and cognitive factors influencing science education. The specific role of socio cultural factors in science learning needs to be established (Jegede 1944a &amp; b). The results of this study provided ample justification for more concerted effort on investigating further the influence of socio-cultural factors on the learning processes within the science classroom environment.
