<plain_text><page sequence="1">OT BOOK REVIEWS 1956 edition is the same as it was in 1949, with only the added comment, "Publication of Luke is the first objective." It leaves us wondering just how important the revisers consider the International NT Text Project. Part III deals with the English Bible. A chapter on Recent and Modern Speech Translations has a few changes here and there, but not very important. The chapter on the Revised Standard Version is also slightly revised throughout, but where the 1949 edition ended on p. 316 the new revision has added about four pages of new material bearing on the completion of that important project and the success of its publication. It is a brief but just appraisal of a notable event in the history of the English Versions. The general bibliography by chapters toward the end of the book has been brought up to date, with some of the older works being eliminated in favor of more recent ones, making for general improvement. The same valuable plates of the earlier editions are reproduced exactly. How much improvement there is in the new edition is hard to decide. If one has the old edition, it is an open question whether the expenditure for the new one is worth- while, but for one who is buying for the first time the 1956 edition is the best thing now available in the field. CHARLES F. NESBITT Thtologie de l'Ancien Testament, Tome I: Dieu, by P. van Imschoot. Paris: Desclee &amp; Cie, 1954. Pp. xiv+273. Pere van Imschoot's book is part of a fairly extensive Bibliothkque de Theologie projected by French-speaking Roman Catholics and covering the fields of dogmatic, moral, and biblical theology, and the history of theology. It forms the second volume of the biblical section, which is under the direction of L. Cerfaux, A. Gelin, and H. Cazelles. It is a welcome addition to its field. In seeking to present his material, van Imschoot acknowledges the validity of both the purely systematic outline directed toward the NT and the purely historical approach to OT theology but himself prefers to indicate the unity of the OT by presenting several major categories under which its thought may logically be grouped. This first volume deals with the topic "God" in four extensive chapters: God considered by himself; God and the world; revelation; and God and his people. Its sequel will take up man and divine judgment and salvation. Although his general articulation of the subject resembles the tripartite divisions employed by Sellin, Kohler, and Eichrodt, van Imschoot nevertheless imposes upon the first part the structure of the medieval dogmaticians. Thus he spends 25 pages on the metaphysical and moral attributes of God. It is not nearly so certain that this distinc- tion can be maintained "without doing violence to Israelite thought" as the author asserts (p. 54). The immediately following paragraphs on the omnipresence (p. 60) and omniscience (p. 62) of God indicate some of the difficulties this involves. Having chosen this vehicle, however, van Imschoot makes exceptionally good use of it. In the same section his treatment of the moral attributes turns around succinct 339</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and informative word studies. The studies of o'nm (pp. 67 f.) and p~x (pp. 71 ff.) are good examples, the latter including a helpful approach to the problem raised in this connection by arnn. The same precision and clarity characterize his treatments of the sentiments of God. Notwithstanding, this section left the reviewer unsatisfied because it failed to take its own results at face value and come to grips with the problem of the impassibility of God. Having given fair indication of the OT view of God's love and forgiveness, as well as his jealousy, anger, and hatred, van Imschoot might have dealt suggestively with its implications for the traditional doctrine of impassibilitas Dei. Perhaps the book's most characteristic chapter is that on revelation. Running to almost 100 pages it includes a discussion of the concept of revelation, then theophanies, angels, dreams, the face of Yahweh, hypostases, and two noteworthy sections on prophets and the Spirit (the last is a field in which van Imschoot has already published numerous articles). To the reviewer van Imschoot's use of this category forms the strongest contribution of his book. Not only is revelation the topic of this major chapter but it effectively undergirds the author's entire biblical theology. It plays a significant role in his typological method (pp. 2 ff.) as well as in his treatment of the difficult problems of anthropomorphism (pp. 28 ff.) and the uniqueness of Israel's "mythology" (pp. 103 ff.). On the other hand, the book exhibits striking unevenness. In addition to the sub- stantial section on the Spirit and revelation, its treatment of angels and demons (pp. 114-41) is probably unmatched in contemporary OT theologies except by that of Heinisch. Yet its sections on word, miracle, and covenant are surprisingly brief and inadequate. Although van Imschoot is a highly competent scholar, widely read in all the major fields touching his topic (as his bibliographies show), his book is somewhat marred by its uncritical correlation of data. It often fails to distinguish even between different periods of OT history, to say nothing of sources. Thus Job and (II) Isaiah are quoted along with Genesis 18; and Amos 5 8 is cited in support of the prophet's pure monotheism. Along this line the book should be characterized as conservative rather than critical or original in its handling of controversial matters. But then the reader is told at the outset that the book is merely a "caricature" which is very condensed and demands much rereading. Helping to fill a gap in the list of Roman Catholic biblical theologies, this work is a welcome addition to its field. Major evaluation, however, must be withheld until the appearance of the second volume. R. LANSING.HICKS Interpretationes ad Vetus Testamentum pertinentes Sigmundo Mowinckel septuagenario missae, eds.
