<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDR? GODIN Mental Health in Christian Life Adopting the idea that mental health is the ability to work and to love, while adjusting constructively and creatively to a changing environment objectively perceived,11 have divided the subject of this paper into two distinct questions: I Is the Christian religion capable of serving mental health, of strengthening or restoring it? As a theologian, I would be inclined to answer affirmatively; but the answer seems to me extremely difficult to justify or even to approach scientifically. II Can mental health assist Christian life? Can it bring to the spirit ual life of Christians the possibility of becoming more Christian? This question, in my opinion, calls forth a clear "yes." Scientifically controlled proof of this answer can be presented, though one may wish that the question had been studied with greater precision than it has been up to the present. I. Can the Christian religion servey strengthen, or restore mental health? This question, very difficult to approach scientifically, may even rest upon a misunderstanding that it is important to clear up. We are not concerned, obviously, with the use of religion (and still less Christianity) as a means of assuring mental health to individuals or groups. God is never a means, but an end. And the religion that keeps us in a living relation with the Divine Presence should never be regarded as a means or as if it were to be used for the acquisition or restoration of</page><page sequence="2">religious person would risk not reaching his full maturity, which as sumes, beyond a primitive and affective egocentrism, a preoccupation with a quite free gift of God (eternal salvation) and an adaptation to transcendent realities. It is indeed salvation in the moral and spiritual sense that we are offered in Christ. Psychic equilibrium can be only an additional benefit, and one that is not always achieved, because biologi cal, social, and psychological conditioning, on which such equilibrium depends, is not (except through a miracle) modified by the grace of God. An improvement of mental health, then, assuming that it could be scientifically proved, would be to the theologian only a possible conse quence, an eventual and progressive restoration of man to a state of natural "integrity," which does not constitute an end in itself. This quite general theological remark implies the granting of com plete freedom to scientific research. At the start of scientific research, it removes certain apprehensions and assures better collaboration between religionists and psychologists. The difficulties of scientific research into our subject are real; but they are sometimes underestimated. A kind of euphoria, arising from great good will, often pervades the atmosphere of groups studying this subject and obscures the hard work that must be done. People talk as if practical applications were the only consideration, as if planning and a program of improvement would be enough, as if deep problems (that is, scientific knowledge about the relation between religion and mental health) had been solved, or at least were on the way to being solved. As a matter of fact, I wonder whether these problems have been seriously approached and even whether we are in agreement about the way to ap proach them. Here are a few examples of some uncertain methods of procedure and of some still unsolved problems. i. Correlations among sociological statistics There have been attempts to throw light upon the influence of reli gion on mental health by means of correlations between dependence upon an established religion and the kinds of behavior indicative of mental health. Durkheim and the early members of his school2 thought that a study of the statistics of suicide and homicide might reveal the religious ele ment as a distinct and active sociological factor. They found a high rate 42 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="3">of suicide in some predominantly Protestant countries (Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, England)?countries that also have a high rate of alcoholism?and a high rate of homicide in countries with Catholic majorities (Italy, Spain, and South as compared with North Ireland). We know that apparent relationships often fall apart when statistical analysis takes into account the developmental factor of age. "Suicide" and "homicide" are found to vary not so much in relation to the religious structure of the society, as Durkheim first suggested, but rather in rela tion to age, the kind of life (industrial or agricultural, urban or rural), social circumstances (wars), and the cultural conditions of an environ ment. At first glance, it seems that the influence of religion, as such, upon mental health has never been demonstrated by means of simple sociologi cal correlations. One might approach the question indirectly through study of forms of moral conduct, which are, in their turn, related to mental health. A well-planned study of this kind would be made in two stages. For example: first, one would find, for a country or a socioeconomic class, the statistical relation between the religious practice of married couples at the beginning of the marriage and conjugal stability. (Positive correlations would probably be easy to determine; some are found in the Kinsey report.) Then one would try to find out the relation be tween broken marriages and the mental health of the children. This second correlation would be more difficult to establish correctly. Indeed, one might suspect a priori that, in certain psychologically troubled homes, the material separation of the parents could have a favorable in fluence on the equilibrium of the children; at any rate, separation would be better for the children than the perpetual disputes of parents living together. In addition, the hereditary factor must not be overlooked. A frequently cited statistic in a study by Maud Merrill3 shows that the proportion of juvenile delinquents to nondelinquents is practically the same among children of divorced parents and in families deprived of the father by death. This is another example of the difficulties encount ered by careful research in this direction. Besides, many statistical studies cited in this area have not employed control groups taken from the gen eral population and hence have little probative value. It is regrettable that there are so few good studies in this area. Of course, such studies would not yet put us in contact with the influence of the religious life as such, since the religious factor would be fragmented into moral conduct and external, controllable kinds of behavior, and Mental Health in Christian Life 43</page><page sequence="4">these factors are obviously clothed with and motivated by other forms of social conditioning. Nevertheless, such studies would provide a serious presumption in favor of an influence of religion on mental health. But are there not religious groups in which a particularly fervent and authentic Christian life would constitute a protection against mental troubles? Such might have been the conclusion of a research by Father Thomas Verner Moore (psychiatrist and at that time a Benedictine in Washing ton) when he studied the proportion of American priests and nuns who were or had been treated for mental troubles.4 Compared with the pro portion in the general population, the proportion of mental illnesses among members of the clergy and of religious communities showed two characteristics that almost entirely counter-balanced each other. In most of the communities or groups, the incidence of mental illness was lower than in the general population, but in other communities or groups (chiefly certain religious communities devoted to the contemplative life), the incidence was abnormally high. Evidently one cannot overlook the facts that the persons in seminaries and convents pursue studies more advanced than the average (which brings an increase of troubles), that these groups are strictly selected (which should lower the incidence of troubles), and that they live in a setting in which there is considerable tolerance of slightly abnormal behavior of others (a fact that would re duce the number of troubles officially reported). Father Thomas Verner Moore noted the attraction for certain pre psychotic personalities of the idea of a cloistered life, isolated, absorbed by prayer, etc. Thus we are turned back to the consideration, not of the religious life itself, but of the particular significance that certain indi viduals attach to it, either in desiring it or in living it. If they are neurotic or prepsychotic, this significance is altered or not clearly perceived. The psychological mode of assimilating the religious life therefore remains the central problem, and this would escape statistics. Father Thomas Verner Moore's recently published book6 affirms that sanctity, viewed as heroic possession of virtues, could have a thera peutic value and could effect a progressive normalization of an initially neurotic condition. The conclusion is based on a study of special, in dividual cases, beyond the statistical questions we have been consider ing. But in an appendix the author publishes a limited statistic (Massa chusetts, 1935) showing that "the insanity rates per 100,000 of priests and Sisters in the United States in 1935 were distinctly lower than for the 44 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="5">married in the general population." Unfortunately, this table, favorable as it is to the author's conclusion, is a limited excerpt from more complete figures. The isolated group considered in this table is not compared with a group of persons having approximately the same cultural and social background and living in an environment approximately as tolerant of mental illness as are religious institutes. Therefore the table is not con vincing. One would better trust the more complete tables published by Father Moore in 1936, in which the conclusion with regard to the pro tective effect of the setting of the religious life upon mental health was not positive. A statistical table compiled by Leah Gold Fein and published in The Academy Reporter for December 1957,6 comparing 55 normal adults, 31 alcoholics, and 50 mentally ill persons, indicates that religious practice within the family is a factor in mental health. In each group, the persons were divided into three categories on the basis of their memories: their early education in the family had been in an orthodox, liberal, or purely formal religion. The differences are statistically significant. Far more of the alcoholics and the mentally ill reported that they were brought up in a religion that was only a "token observance." Regrettably, in this interesting little pilot study, one is not informed about the composition of the group of "normal" adults, of whom 32 said they had had orthodox religious practice within their families, 17 liberal, and 6 purely formal religious observance. As the findings rest entirely on comparison with this group of normal persons, ignorance of its composi tion weakens one's acceptance of the author's inference that "normal adults come from homes in which religion was respected and observed, while adults with affective and mental troubles come from homes in which religion was treated lightly, looked down upon, or completely neglected." We believe that findings based on childhood memories can not lead to such a conclusion. The alcoholic, especially, can easily say that his education was "purely formal" in the attempt to blame his parents for his pitiable situation. It is remarkable, too, that none of the alcoholics or the mentally ill reported having belonged to a family with "liberal" religion. Hence this category (which seems to have had meaning only for the normal) introduces grave doubt of the statistical calculations and completely contradicts the apparent conclusions. But, as I have noted, the fault lies rather in the choice of the 55 normal adults who served as the point of comparison. It is not easy, obviously, to find out accurately the influence of reli Mental Health in Christian Life 45</page><page sequence="6">gious education, and still less easy, we shall see, to discern the influence of religion itself. 2. Careful interpretation of the psychological effects of religion Turning to positive observations, individual or clinical, one sees with equal force problems of method and interpretation that seem insurmount able in any collective study and that show the inadequacies of any purely statistical approaches to our problem. In a well-known book, Henry Murray presents a conclusion that is at first glance a cause of rejoicing for Catholics.7 "The Catholic subjects," he remarks, "were conspicuously more solid and secure [than average]. There was relatively little anxiety linked material bubbling in the minds of the Catholics . . . They were relatively happy, free from neurotic symptoms_" But one must not rejoice too quickly. Here is Murray's interpretation, well justified according to Father Edward Nowlan,8 and based on the special type of Catholic students living at Harvard and participating voluntarily in this research. "Their repressions were firmer," writes Murray, "and what occurred in their depths could only be inferred indirectly by intepreting their projections. It was as if their faith in an ultimate authority relieved them of the necessity of independently resolving fundamental issues. Their unconscious fears, one might say, were quieted by the hovering presence of the maternal Church. If they were unable sometimes to live up to the precepts of religion, they knew that forgiveness was always at hand. A secret, remorseful confession and once more they would be beneficently accepted members of the flock. It might be supposed that the irrational unconscious tendencies of these Catholics were so satisfactorily inter preted by a wise, human, and altogether forgiving Church that they never knew what it was to feel themselves alone and forsaken in a mael strom of incommunicable feelings and ideas . . . The problem of good and evil is settled and only the problems of moral will remain ..." So the happy effect of this religion, or pseudo-religion, on the "psy chism" is not an unmixed blessing. In his interpretation, Murray passes over the influence of religion in the area of the superego, favoring thereby not a truly human development, but rather a certain sterilization of the creative potentialities of religious persons. In any case, the problem thus posed exists and brings with it a method ological question linked to a question of real depth. If Christian life oper 46 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="7">ates as a factor only of appeasement, only of adaptation to the Christian group, only of balance, it is because it may have been assimilated through certain not very authentic contacts in a partial perspective, and not ac cording to the totality of its inherent values. Hence the difficulty: does religion act on mental health, or on the repressions? Therefore, with respect to the objective meaning of religion (with which philosophers and theologians are concerned), we are constantly forced, as psychologists, to take account of the special meanings that each individual attaches to religious values and to his perception of them. If alcoholism can be used as an escape from reality, religion also can have the meaning of an escape. The quality is different, certainly. But if it is a question of an unauthentic religion, one not conforming to Chris tian values, it matters little to us to know whether that religion produces good psychological effects. So it would seem that only a clinical method, studying individual de velopment of health or of neurosis, can reveal the eventual influence of authentic religion (motivations, attitudes, conduct) upon mental health. Psychological literature offers certain descriptions along these lines,9 but they are not very well systematized. 3. Christian life and mental health of children Would the psychological development of the child lead us to eval uate the influence of Christian life as a mental health factor? Certainly it would do so if the religion corresponded to a strictly instinctive need. But can one say, from the psychological, affective point of view, that the child has an instinctive need that would be frustrated outside a religious formation? Or does that formation, notably the Chris tian formation, represent a luxury, morally imperious perhaps (if God speaks and calls), but one of which the child has no psychological need? In this case, religion would bring him a richness, but it could also repre sent a handicap that would burden him, sometimes prematurely, and in certain cases hinder his purely human development. On this point, let us look at some conclusions set forth in a report on mental health and religious formation at the preschool level presented by the child psychiatrist Dr. Jacques Schurmans at the meeting of the Bel gian Catholic Association of Mental Hygiene in 1955.10 In the absence of precise and systematically conducted studies, we must admit that, at first glance, there appears to be no important differ ence, from the mental health point of view, between young people Mental Health in Christian Life 47</page><page sequence="8">brought up in religious or nonreligious surroundings. Everything else being equal, one cannot say categorically that the Christian formation responds to an affective need of the child nor that its absence interferes with his psychological development. However, the fact that children brought up without religion are as well as others does not permit one to conclude that religious forma tion is not important. We know, indeed, that all preschool-age children, even those raised in atheistic surroundings, develop a certain embryonic and spontaneous religion. According to studies of genetic psychology, those of Piaget for example, one may well say that there is no child with out religion. Spontaneously the preschool-age child lives in a marvelous artificiality, in magic; his world is entirely animated by psychic life, by rather punitive purposes, etc. This primitive religious life develops no matter what are the spiritual opinions of his parents. Hence the problem is not to know whether one should give or not give a religion to the child, but to know whether one should cultivate and favor the development of his natural religion or rid him of it, inhibit it as quickly as possible. For a Christian, the problem will be to know how this spontaneous religiosity of the child can be led and ripened into the divine mystery revealed in Christ and finally structured through Him. From the scientific point of view, in relation to mental health, religion is part of a surrounding culture that the child must assimilate. One must, then, if possible, compare not two groups of children, but three groups of selected adults: the first brought up in a neutral atmosphere without any religious influence; the second having been reared from earliest years in an antireligious environment; and the third having received a religious formation favorable to their psychological and spiritual growth. Without such research, nothing can be firmly established. But it is evident that we can foresee certain aspects, favorable or unfavorable, to the religious preparation of children. We shall say something about this in the last part of this report. 4. The religious factor in psychotherapy Another doubtful point related to the positive influence of religion brings up the difficult problem of the systematic use of beliefs, of be havior, and of moral and religious commitments as direct therapeutic factors, i.e., in terms of the relationship between the psychotherapist and the patient. This question, related to psychotherapeutic technique, is at present controversial. 48 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="9">Most French, English, and American psychoanalysts and psycho therapists favor techniques aimed at modifying the "psychism" (defined as the "field of forces" in which the bio-socio-affective conditionings of the personality come together) by specifically psychic means, without explicit evocation of moral commitments or discussion of religious values. A strong Germanic current, on the other hand, is sensitive to the unity of the personality, to the totality of interpersonal rapport between the therapist and the patient, and to the possibility of effectively utilizing the subjective aspect of religious realities as well as values of health and restorative forces. The first current is a typical derivative from Freudian analysis. The second, without always being historically dependent upon Jung, could nevertheless claim connection with many of the perspectives of the mas ter of Zurich. The religious meaning of a therapy should never be considered as the special privilege of the therapists following the second tendency. They sometimes tend to believe it; but one will observe, on consulting the works of those Freudians who are preoccupied with religious values, that religion is rather well (if not better) respected by them.11 From the Catholic point of view, there are the words of Pope Pius XII speaking to Catholic psychotherapists and psychoanalysts: "These questions, which lend themselves to scientific psychological examination, belong to your competence."12 We hope that the finding of these perspectives, sometimes divergent, will bring about appreciable progress, notably the possibility of approach ing scientifically (i.e., clinically) the question considered in this paper: can the religious attitude, as such, have a direct influence that is empiri cally discernible upon the cure of a neurosis? Conclusion Let us end here our answer to the first question. If religion has an in fluence upon mental health, it is only in the individual clinical area, through a longitudinal examination of motivations, attitudes, and com mitments, that it can be, if not easily recognizable, at least correctly posed as a problem. Psycho-sociological statistics will furnish only a presump tion. Mental Health in Christian Life 49</page><page sequence="10">II. Does better mental health favor Christian life, offering it a possibility of becoming more Christian? The answer to this highly interesting question seems easier to arrive at. And one may hope that there will be more methodical studies in this area. The important point would be to know to what degree children or adults whose mental balance is disturbed are handicapped in regard to their religion, either in expressing it outwardly, or living it within them selves, or even in perceiving the fullness of the Christian message (Bibli cal, liturgical, doctrinal) correctly presented. Here there are more precise studies. To limit our consideration, let us take a scientific approach to the third type of influence: the neurotic person's difficulty in correctly per ceiving the appeal of Christian values, an aspect of deficient perception that probably lends itself best to investigation. In the Christian education of young children, one can see that all psychic deficiency, reaching the deepest layers of the affective life (un der the age of four years) has terrible repercussions on the assimilation of religious themes included in a Christian education. A lack, for ex ample, in the child's security (chiefly in his relation with his mother), an increase of psychic fear, a rigid strengthening of the superego, and un fortunate structuring of the Oedipal relation with his mother or father ?all this profoundly affects the later development of his understanding of God.13 All that is learned in the catechism, at the age of 6 or 7, about the authority of God, about His goodness, about His pardon that is al ways offered, etc., all that must first be lived in the relation with the father and mother. Where the great affective images lack a basis in per sonal experience, the concepts learned in the catechism touch only the in tellect, never reaching the depths of affectivity. The religion of charity, of love, of pardon, is learned by memory, but it does not penetrate the personality. One becomes aware of this fact when adults communicate the infantile state in which their image of God has remained:u in many cases it is a root of possible disbelief. God, no longer fulfilling the psychic functions assigned to Him by a religion acquired in a neurotic manner, soon becomes an object of doubt, of crisis, or a rejected image. The fun damental transition in Christian education has not been made; the human being is caught up in an egocentric, largely illusory image of God, and does not accept (affectively at least) the mystery of divine charity as a value to which all else is morally and spiritually subordinated. 50 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="11">It would be interesting to know more precisely what are the critical periods of the child's development in which sensitivity to the religious factor is particularly acute, in harmony with his affective maturation: spontaneous anthropomorphism of an omniscient God strengthened by a rigid superego (5-7 years); prolonged fixation of the stages of animistic magic so well described by Piaget, a condition nourished by certain mar velous or miraculous aspects of Biblical stories (6-8 years); reflexes strengthened by insecurity prolonging the expectation of "an inherent immediate justice";15 partial contamination of the religious attitude by an anxious, adolescent moralism growing out of obsessive neurosis (scrupu losity) ; development of intergroup prejudices (racial, for example) of which certain American inquiries have revealed the connection not with Christianity, but with the aggressiveness that is falsely compared with it in certain partial aspects.16 Studies in this area should be very precise. Working with Melle Vandercam, we were able to show that the un derstanding of a Biblical story (Abraham and Isaac) told for the first time in simple terms to children six to eight years old was completely al tered by children suffering from insecurity and personality disturbance. The drawings showed that these anxious children identified rigidly with Isaac and perceived the menace of the story much more strongly than the divine protection, the latter being the fundamental meaning of the story: rejection of all human sacrifice.17 In the mind of the neurotic child, many religious subjects are dis torted. Fran?oise Dolto has described cases of disturbed children whose thought processes have been so violently invaded by the idea of the devil as to threaten psychological disassociation and hindrance of maturation.18 Hanna Colm, another child psychoanalyst, has written a remarkable article19 in which she describes three children whose idea of God was involved in neuroses: Anne (12 years old), on the basis of her neurotic claim that others should take the responsibility for meeting her every want and need, could not establish real relationships with the people around her, particularly with her father; she would angrily demand from God all that she failed to get from her parents and others within her cir cle. Peter (10 years) projected onto God his self-condemnation for a secret hatred of his father; he would act out his aggressiveness by shoot ing arrows toward the sky for long periods. Jim (6 years), constantly pushed back and forth between trust in God and doubt of His existence, felt the need to compete with God and to check on His reliability. He Mental Health in Christian Life 51</page><page sequence="12">would frequently run outdoors in the evening to see whether the stars were all where they belonged. At one time he crawled into a dresser drawer, making himself very small and saying he was Jesus, the Christ Child; then he jumped out, screaming, "Now I am Christopher Colum bus." Clinical analysis of religious symbols in cases of neurotic children should be pursued. The religious vitality of adults also is impeded by a lack of mental health. It would be interesting to know what elements of religion are most often seized upon and contaminated in neuroses and psychoses. Wayne E. Oates has studied the role played by religious ideas in the cases of 68 psychotic or prepsychotic persons.20 He found that 17 per cent of the cases had been troubled by moral-religious conflicts of long dura tion; in 10 per cent of the cases a "pseudo-religious" experience had been the precipitating factor; 20 per cent of the cases had borrowed from religion the content of their thought. About half of the psychoses had developed in connection with religious themes, almost all resulting from poor education in childhood or from deviant perception of religious faith or practice. For my part, in pastoral and psychotherapeutic counseling, I am more and more struck by the repercussion of neurotic tendencies upon partial or false perception of religious teaching. The neurotic person, one might say, is incapable of living the totality of Christian truths in a rich synthe sis that, for the healthy person, combines the vital paradoxes of religion. For the neurotic, one aspect of religious teaching or message devours all others: the aspect of conquest (aggressive) of the Kingdom of God, for example, conceals the infinite patience of divine charity; vengeful and intransigent justice overshadows the compassion that ceaselessly offers pardon; the Virgin, as gentle, protecting mother, hides the woman who is actively the co-redeemer, and so forth. Obviously it is not the transcendent meaning of religious symbolism that is in question, but the relation of the religious message with the af fective tonalities whereby mental health deficiencies eventually stifle cer tain resonances and sharpen others. One may still considerably broaden the perspective by comparing, in this respect, the action of different religions. In an interesting discussion held by the group on religion and mental health of the World Federa tion for Mental Health,21 psychiatrists and psychologists of four great religions expressed the belief that these four religions offered somewhat 52 Journal of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="13">different sustenance to various neurotic troubles. Christianity, lived in the Western World, is most often used in the line of obsessive neurosis (moral scruples), and the Asiatic religions and Judaism in the line of hysteria. These are only generalities, depending upon the surrounding culture and social level of the patients seen by these psychiatrists and psychologists. But some psychiatrists, having had experience with groups of patients of the same culture but different religions, agree in assigning certain particular religious contents to certain neuroses in keeping with a particular religious orientation. These questions deserve scientific study; it is unnecessary to add that they are a distant goal for research; more immediately accessible topics ought to have priority. Conclusion The influence of mental health upon the perception, assimilation, and expression of religious values is very apparent. As the precision of our knowledge increases, there is no lack of evidence for an affirmative answer to the question posed for the second part of this report. If the proper methods for studying the influence of religion on mental health have seemed to us to be full of ambiguity, it has also seemed to us that the future development of our scientific knowledge relative to the influence of mental health upon religion is entirely feasible and highly desirable. To work for better mental health is to permit believers (and this is equally valid for all religions and all faiths) to gain better understanding of the call of their religion in all its authenticity. The very perception of the religious message, in its richness and complexity, would be en hanced if one could raise the level of balance and of psychological ma turity in a population. Mental health does not automatically make men more religious (we have no interest in an automatic, conditioned reli gion), but it prepares a better background in which the word of God may be heard, received, and more fully assimilated. It is in this perspective that we all must work together?doctors, psy chologists, educators, priests?toward improvement of mental health. Let us, however, avoid unenlightened enthusiasm; let us keep ourselves from undertakings of which the practical applications would be directed toward illusory purposes. An effective program demands precise objects: these can be formulated only on the basis of methodically conducted re search and scientifically established conclusions.
