<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO HE duality of subject and object in all experience is a X cardinal feature, and in a sense the pivot, of Ward's psychology, of his theory of knowledge, and of his onto logical metaphysic. Largely by its means, he tells us, dual ism is overcome. There is no "ugly broad ditch" or for bidding battlements between spirit and nature. Instead there is necessary correlation and a bi-polar integrity in place of unintelligible conjunction of disparate substances. With the ruin of dualism, also, goes the annihilation of naturalism We escape from the contradiction of a self subsistent phenomenon of Nature; and are able to deal faithfully, not with an "epiphenomenal" mind, ornamental and impotent, but with the realities of attention and inter est. Dualism itself is a mistaken interpretation of the mes sage of "intersubjective intercourse" and of the "trans subjective reference" elicited from the same. It rests on the fallacy of taking independence of any particular mind to be independence absolute. The same fallacy taints and corrodes every species of naturalism and, quite peculiarly, its agnostic form. In this duality, we are told, Nature and those portions of Nature which we select and apprehend, are given to us as objective. They are apprehended, that is to say, as data which confront and may constrain us, not as modifications of our own private being or as appearances situate within our heads. Theories of the latter type depend upon the</page><page sequence="2">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO "intrejection" fallacy according to which we lose sight of the plain deliverance of our experience and sophisticate ourselves in its stead with analogies applied to our own case from what we take to be the predicament of other percipients. Despite this objectivity of phenomenal pre sented data, however, there is an important sense in which, according to Ward's theory, the subjective pole of this bi-polar integrity takes the lead. Quoting Goethe with approval, Ward tells us that "Man never realizes how an thropomorphic he is."1 We may add "and ought to be." Even in Nature, the "real" categories of substance, cause and end are, in the last analysis, imputed with assurance because of a certainty borne in upon us from the subjective pole of the bi-polar "experience" which is the governing reality in all these matters. This contention, to be sure, is not an abstract or "high priori" creed in Ward's phil osophy. On the contrary, it is enforced and supported by a sachlich, searching review of the achievements of mind in its scrutiny of Nature.2 Its foundation, however, lies in our psychological predicament, and the consequences, philosophically speaking, are momentous. "We find again without us," Ward says, "the permanence and individual ity, the efficiency, and the adaptation we have found first of all within."3 Or more at length, "The main structure of our concept of Nature is entirely anthropomorphic. The unity of Nature is the ideal counterpart of the actual unity of each individual experience, where synthesis ever pre cedes analysis, and things are only distinguished relatively to each other so long as they are apperceived together by the one subject. The category of causality we owe to the interaction of active subjects with their environment and 1 Naturalism and Agnosticism, Vol. II, p. 165.

Then as to the regularity of Nature or the universal reign of law, this never has been, and never can be, empirically established, nor does its denial involve any contradiction. It is a postulate that has its root in our primitive credulity : were this anticipatio mentis never confirmed, knowledge would be impossible ; but confirmed as it is continuously in our earliest experience we thus advance to an interpretatio naturae as an orderly and intelligible system, a cosmos that evinces directly or indirectly the all-pervading presence of mind."4 I have reminded the reader of these matters (and at some length) in order to show that Ward's account of the subject has an important, and in certain ways, a dominat ing function in his entire philosophy, and that, in some sense, we must be presumed to have a knowledge of the Ego, or at least an assurance concerning it, which is at least less uncertain than most of the bewildering uncertain ties with which we are perplexed in these intricate afifairs. This, on the one hand. On the other, it seems plain that the fons et origo of this knowledge or assurance must lie somewhere within the ambit of our own psychological ex perience Ward, indeed, says so expressly. "We begin our study with our own experience," he tells us, "since other experience can be intelligible only in terms of this."5 With this preamble, therefore, I think I can explain, and in a certain small degree may even justify, the plan which I intend to follow in these pages. Taking the psychologi cal account of the ego to be the core of this immensely im portant contention, I propose to devote my attention in the main to the profound and careful analysis which Ward supplies in his Psychological Principles, and merely to sup plement this inquiry, as need may arise, by references to *R., 11-12. P., 361.</page><page sequence="4">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO 93 his other works. This is the best I can do, I think, on so wide a theme when the need for brevity is plain; but I should like to add a further and a more personal explana tion. In confining my comments, in this fashion, to a rela tively small, if a very fundamental, part of Ward's argu ment, I cannot even indicate the wealth of knowledge and the extraordinarily adequate equipment which he brings to his task. To a profound knowledge of philosophy and of its history he adds the genius of our foremost psycholo gist, and he combines with these the sifted and penetrating synthesis of a mind familiar at first hand with the theologi cal, social, biological, physical, and mathematical sciences. To deal with a part of his theory is therefore to do it injus tice; and those of us who have had the privilege of being his pupils, are continually reminded of the circumstance. We learned more from this amazing adequacy of his equip ment than from any more specialized employment of it; and the example which he gave us in this respect (not of set intention but from the character of his teaching) was sec ond only (as we know) to the balance and wisdom of his outlook upon life and to the supreme intellectual candour which none who knew him can fail to have noticed and to have felt. I admit, then, that any partial inquiry is most mischievously curtailed, and that any particular objection is liable to conquest by a completer understanding. Never theless, Ward's contentions are argued step by step. He shows us precisely what we must accept if we are to go along with him ; and if we baulk at any point he would have been the last to desire to coerce us. Ward's account of the ego, in its main theoretical struc ture, is given in the definition and general analysis of his Psychological Principles, together with the fifteenth chap ter of that work when he deals with the presentation of self, with self-consciousness and with "subjective being/' Accordingly, I shall deal with his account of these matters</page><page sequence="5">94 THE MONIST in this order, and attempt a bald and brief summary of his principle contentions, indicating at the same time the points which seem to me to be either most important or most de bateable. The introduction to the Psychological Principles, follow ing the historical method, explains in detail that psychol ogy is not the "science of mind," either in the sense of Descartes' dualism (according to which minds are res completae) or according to the conceptions of a Lockian "internal sense." This "internal sense" is reflection or self-consciousness, and at this level "the so-called object experience seems clearly implicated in the so-called "sub ject-experience."6 Even Kant who, unlike the philoso phers before him, recognized the inseparability of subject and object in experience, had too few misgivings concern ing this internal sense.7 Nevertheless, Kant showed us the way; and if we agree that psychology is to be defined as individualistic or as dealing expressly with individual experience, we have to ask only how far and in what ways its "subjective" aspect is contrasted with the "objective" aspect of the sciences. Here "we can answer at once : the one is the standpoint of conscious life-or more fully the standpoint of the living subject in intercourse with his spe cial environment ; the other is the standpoint of Science in which the characteristics of individual environments are in general ignored."8 Thus "subjective" and "objective" have different meanings in psychology and epistemology. "In epistemology, 'objective/ we might say, means so much of experience as is common property, and 'subjective' so much as is private property: in psychology, 'subjective' refers to the owner, and 'objective' to the property that he owns,"9 Or again (and advancing the argument). e P., 16. 7 P., 14. s P., 17. . P., 18.</page><page sequence="6">JAMES WARDTS ACCOUNT OF THE EGO 95 "The so-called operations and states of consciousness are not mere modes in vacuo; they imply an active and affect ive subject, and it can only conduce to clearness to make this fact as explicit as possible. The so-called contents of consciousness, again, though not necessarily actions or affections of the subject, are never objects per se; to be contents of consciousness they must be objects for a sub ject."10 The implication contained in the former of these statements is our main business at this time. It is, how ever, correlative with the latter ; and the latter shows that "the way of ideas" (i. e., of objects of the understanding) is the proper path of psychology. These "objects," howr ever, belong to a subject. "By whatever methods, from whatever sources its facts are ascertained they must-to have a psychological import-be regarded as having a place in, or as being a constituent of, someone's experi ence."^ Individual experience is, therefore, the experience of a subject which finds its own property confronting it objec tively and interacting with it. Indeed, "Every Ego has its own correlative non-Ego" ;12 and we dare not deny or for get the Ego through an interest in the "presentations" which are the objects of its attention and interest. The argument, from this point onwards, is in the main a refutation of presentationism. The Ego is not the soul of pre-Kantian metaphysics. On the contrary "by pure Ego or Subject it is proposed to denote here the simple fact that everything experienced is referred to a Self expe riencing."13 This is an "inexpugnable assumption"14 even for Hume who treats it as a fiction. Therefore, we had better accept it, and frankly. The Ego is not the body, for the body is a phenomenon and therefore someone's phe 10 P, 24. 11 P., 27. 12 P., 31. is P., 35. i4 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">96 THE MONIST nomenon; and a self-sufficient representationism is a con tradiction in terms. Again, a series of "mental phenom ena" or presentations cannot possibly (as Mill suggested) be aware of itself as a series. One part of the series can not be aware of the rest, since both, ex hypothesis are ob jects of awareness; and no single privileged phenomenon could ever accomplish what no phenomenon can achieve. In short, every phenomenon is the property of a subject and must continue a piece of property. This property, moreover, cannot be elicited from the subjective side, e. g.f from "feeling," since feeling is part of "subjective being" not an object of the ego. "The simplest form of psychical life involves not only a subject feeling but a subject hav ing qualitatively distinguishable objective presentations which are the causes of its feeling."15 Through feeling a change of attention is induced, and this attention, again, is not an object or presentation but belongs to subjective being. In the final analysis, therefore, the subject attends to and is moved by the presentations of objects. The subject itself is not an object at all. Neither it, nor its feeling, nor its attention, can ever be known immediately in them selves.16 They are known only mediately and through their effects. This, which is a paradox, is also inevitable. For philosophers have acknowledged very widely since the days of Kant that the subjective qua subjective cannot be pre sented. This paradox is certainly considerable since it seems to imply that neither pleasure nor pain (the two modes of feeling) nor even the difference between them can ever be (&lt;known immediately in themselves" but only mediately and through their effects ; and most of us, I think, would say (with perhaps a trace of stubbornness) that the truth which has been shown is only that in so far as pleasure or " p. 45. 16 P., 58.</page><page sequence="8">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO 97 pain are not organic sensations they do not confront us in the same manner as certain other knowable facts (say sense data) do. The statement on a later page of the vol ume17 that "feeling as such is, so to put it, matter of being rather than of direct knowledge; and all that we know about it, we know either from its antecedents or from its consequents in presentation" may not seem to diminish the paradox appreciably; or even the further statement that feeling is "a unique and ultimate factor in all experience."18 If we grant its consequences and its reality as a mode of "subjective being," we still may suppose ourselves to have some sort of acquaintance with it ; and if this acquaintance is not to be called knowledge, the most natural inference would seem to be that "knowledge" is being defined in a technical and peculiar sense. Similar difficulties appear to wait upon the parallel statements Dr. Ward makes con cerning attention. The attention process, we are told, has for its modes, the varieties of remembering, perceiving, in ferring, desiring, striving; and so forth.19 These imply activity as well as object.20 Yet we are driven to question ing; for if these varieties are, as in the case of feeling, modes of our (subjective) "being" we might attempt to conclude (but apparently are forbidden to conclude) that, in part at least, these processes are just what we are; and if we distinguish between them (as apparently we do) it is hard to avoid the belief that the distinctions are based upon some kind of immediate acquaintance. If this were not so how could we impute them, anthropomorphically, in the "real" categories we prescribe to Nature : how could we find again what we have found first of all within? In a word, as we have seen, there is at least a pretext for the suspicion that the term "knowledge" is being used in some special and unnaturally restricted sense. P., 245. 18 Ibid. 19 P., 60. 20 Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">98 THE MONIST These dubieties, however, may perhaps be dispelled by a fuller understanding of Doctor Ward's account of our knowledge of self or of subjective being. This extended description, as we have seen, is supplied in Chapter XV of the Psychological Principles; and so we come to it. The fundamental fact, here, is the reference of experi ence to a self that has it.21 This we attribute to all con sciousness; and our consciousness of this consciousness, the je ne connais of the French, is the special problem of the chapter.22 Ward distinguishes sharply between the self which is known (/. e., the Me or the empirical Ego) and the know ing I (or pure Ego). Of all presentations whatsoever we may say, "This presentation is mine; it is my object; I am the subject attending to it."28 It is the pure Ego to which this ultimate reference of any object is made; and the em pirical Ego, the self known or presented, can only be one object or presentation among the others. This inexorable circumstance determines the lines of the inquiry. The earliest nucleus of the Me is the "vital sense" or coenaesthesis ; and an obvious and primitive interpretation of this nucleus leads us to think of the self as situated within the body and consisting of somatic appetites and reverber ations. Hence we pass to an inner but still bodily self some where within the breast, desiring rather than simply appe titive, imagining as well as in present contact, through per ception, with its environment. Finally, and more intelli gently "we come at length upon the concept which every intelligent being more or less distinctly forms of himself as a person, M or N, having such and such a character, tastes and convictions, such and such a history, and such and such an aim in life."24 This "inmost self," revealed to us chiefly in social life, is the "thinking and willing" self. But it is not the pure Ego ; and the fact remains that this 2ip.. 361. 22 Ibid. 23 P., 363. 24 P., 368.</page><page sequence="10">JAMES WARDTS ACCOUNT OF THE EGO 99 "inmost self" is not inward enough, or rather that the pure Ego is of a different order from even the innermost in wardness. For further elucidation a certain symbolism is given us. Assuming that "external perception" is ade quately symbolized by SpO we should symbolize "internal perception" (i. e., self-cognition) as Ip[Mp'0'].25 Here I is the pure Ego, and is expressly stated to have the single faculty of attention and the single capacity of feeling, as also (of course) to be itself incapable of being presented. M, of course, is the empirical Me at whatever stage it is known (but especially at the highest and most usual stage). In his interpretation of this symbolic structure Ward does not directly discuss the relation of S to I ; and he treats O' as being "a differentiation of O {e. g., My thunder as I hear it is to be considered a "differentiation" of thunder not so qualified). What he does discuss is the character of M/&gt;'0', the relation of p' to p and of M to I. Varying his phrases slightly, but preserving (as I think) his mean ing, we may say that the statement I am conscious of (my self as hearing this clap of thunder) is adequate, in his view, to the whole complex situation here set forth for in vestigation. In this statement every part is significant and must somehow be capable of being explained. I must con fess to a doubt, however, whether Ward's interpretation can be sustained. Let us first consider M/&gt;'0'. When we think of "our selves hearing thunder," we commonly distinguish our selves from the thunder, but it is not so plain that we dis tinguish ourselves from our hearing. Certainly, if the M (ourselves) is taken to be some "inner sense" of our bodies or some still more inward somatic reverberation, we do distinguish this M from p'O'; but if M is the "thinking and willing" (although empirical) self it is not at all plain that we draw the distinction except in so far as pf is a 25 P., 371.</page><page sequence="11">IOO THE MONIST momentary event and M more or less abiding. If this is the whole distinction, however, M might very well be a continuity of p's and not distinct from any p'. [Certain psychologists would hold of course that "sensation" does not contain p' and O', (sensing and sensum, say) but that it is intrinsically single. I am omitting this, however, and am still very sensible of a difficulty in the remainder.] Again: if p' is correctly described as remembering, hear ing, imagining (and the rest) then not only may M be in distinguishable from a continuity of p's but p' bids fair to be indistinguishable from p. As we have seen, these very instances of remembering, perceiving and the rest were stated in an earlier chapter to be instances of attention;28 and attention, it is here stated (and in general abundantly evident) is a faculty of I (i. e., it is p, not p'). This leads us, secondly, to the relation of p to p'; and here, as I cannot help thinking, Ward's theory is poised upon a razor edge. As we have noted, the refutation of presentationism in his general analysis depended upon the intrinsic impossibility of precisely that which here he de clares to occur. His argument there was that no presen tation, however privileged, could ever have the relation to other presentations which the subject has to all presenta tions. Since p is stated here to be different from p', con sistency is so far retained, but the symbolism at least sug gests an important and instructive analogy, and the use of the same term (as remembering) to describe both, makes the "analogy," to say the least, very pointed. Ex hypothesi, however, M (a presentation) cannot have at all the same relation to other presentations as I has to all presentations, and the similarity of the relation, if there is one, must be more misleading than instructive. In the third place, M must be toto genere different from I, since M is an object, presentation, or phenomenon while 26 P., 60.</page><page sequence="12">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO IOI I is the subject of all objects, presentations or phenomena. Yet M in its inwardness, permanence and observable action points the way to I. In Ward's own words "To identify I and Me is logically impossible, for, ex vi terminorum, it is to identify subject and object."27 Yet "we know intellec tually what we are as experients : into the empty "form of consciousness' our being fits" ;28 and "that pure subject or Ego which we reach in our analysis of experience at its rational level stands for an abstraction so long as we are content to distinguish it without attempting to separate it from its objective complement, the non-Ego."29 Again "this concept of the pure Ego, or I, is the limit to which the empirical Ego points."30 A limit may certainly lie outside the series which ap proximates to it, yet if subject and object are always the opposite poles of a bi-polar unity (and so defined by their contrast in complement) it is hard to see how M can ever be so very instructive concerning I ; and the analogy which M offers in respect of inwardness, efficacy, and permanence seems particularly precarious. It is admitted that M, at its highest level is only metaphysically "inwards" and that I is perfectly non-spatial. It is declared, again, that activ ity cannot be observed; and if that is true no process can ever be observably active, and any "activities" of M (which seem to be observed) must be totally devoid of genuine efficacy. The case for permanence is still more dubious. M has indeed a certain permanence. We may certainly hold that "I have the same me as I had yesterday" ; but we cannot say that "I am the same I that I was yesterday" if all we know is that yesterday's Me was the same Me as today's. I cannot see any reason for the inference. All "objects" imply the ownership of same subject but it does not follow that different enduring objects imply different 27 P., 379. ss p., 381. 29 P., 379. 30 P., 377.</page><page sequence="13">I02 THE MONIST owners. (One might as well say that two ponies, if they are owned, imply two owners.) If the objects are owned at all the essential condition is satisfied. It would be satis fied, say, if all the Me's were owned by a single Ich-an-sich, or by that "consciousness in general" (or Bewusstsein berhaupt) of which Ward, taking his cue from Kant, so often speaks. And it would be satisfied in any other sys tem of ownership. All the three points we have considered, therefore (and none of them is trivial) contain serious difficulties, and their structural combination (or even the strigose sym bolism in which, following Ward's lead, we have tried to regard them) does not seem entirely convincing. I would not be misunderstood, however, when I say this. The prob lem which Ward discusses in these chapters is the most intricate, as it is the central, theme of a reflective psychol ogy ; and a psychology which is not reflective and reasoned (but content to deal wholesale in genial aper us, sweeping generalizations or spacious analogies) is unworthy of what ought to be the honored name of psychical science. The systematic architectonic on which Ward has spent so much pains, and to which he has brought so much insight, wis dom and philosophy, is precisely what a developed science of psychology imperatively requires. Anyone, therefore, who dissents from it, for reasons shown, is aware, firstly, that Ward's analytical structure is an extraordinarily able attempt tc deal with the cruces of the problem; and sec ondly that any adequate alternative is all but certain to follow the lines he has set forth (at least in great measure) and to fall, somewhere, within the framework which he supplies. Consequently, if we dissent, we dissent with gratitude and with hope. And if we attempt some alterna tive within the general framework we know that, even if our own constructions are wrong, they are still attempts to answer the right questions, and on the right lines.</page><page sequence="14">JAMES WARDTS ACCOUNT OF THE EGO IO3 Believing, then, as I do, that the most fruitful line of investigation in this important matter is to be found in the further exploration of alternatives within the general framework of Ward's argument, I venture (although with the greatest diffidence) to offer certain reflections upon these cardinal points in the analysis. These are : ( I ) p or the "ownership" of the objects of experience; (2) the nat ure of M or of the "empirical self": and (3) the unknow ability of I. On the first two of these I shall be very brief. The third point, if not treated very perfunctorily, needs fuller comment. (1) It is doubtful, I think, whether the relationship of the Ego to its objects is properly to be described as "owner ship." What is part of myself may perhaps be called my property, and I am said, more strictly, to "own" anything which I am permitted to use, with or without restrictions, for my own private purposes. It seems to many, however, that the mere fact that I am acquainted with this or that does not necessarily imply possession, in any intelligible sense. Tf presentations, although appearing as objects, are ultimately psychical in character (or parts of the "psy choplasm" in that sense) they would be personal property; but the revival of realism in the twentieth century appears to show that there is a possibility, at least, that this con clusion does not necessarily follow from the "ego-centric predicament." And the use of this property, if it were property, does not seem to correspond to ordinary notions of possession. To the prisoner, judge, turnkey and exe cutioner are his objects in the sense that he is aware of them-until the drop comes. But they are not at his dis posal. Cognitively, these objects, as Berkeley himself some times admitted, are "in the mind" only in the sense that they are "before the mind." In other words they are my objects only because / attend to them, and some philoso</page><page sequence="15">I04 THE MONIST phers at least take the plain reading of experience to be that the objects of our experience reveal themselves (for the most part) not to be "ours" at all, but on the contrary facts which do not require us (either as sensitive or as in telligent) although we have learned (up to a point) how to inspect and interpret them. This question, in a word, is still in debate; and although our attention, as Ward convincingly points out, is not merely cognitive, but also conational and suffused with feeling, it would not appear that these inducements to, and restruction of, our sensitive and intellectual selection, necessarily result in "ownership" of any indubitable sort. Even if every self is confronted in a sense with its own non-Ego, it does not follow that this specific non-Ego is a piece of property any more than the fact that a book lies upon its own part of the table makes the table a possession of the book. (2) We said that the relation of M to I presents serious difficulties. In consequence there is a temptation either to deny the existence of one or the other, or to seek for some thing which is both. Anyone indeed who believes that there is no self other than the living mind which is our psy chical existence is bound to deny any ultimate distinction between the "empirical" and the "pure" Ego. For Ward, such a distinction is ineluctable since the "pure" Ego can not be known (as a presented object) and yet cannot be gainsaid ; and this is the third and last point we are to dis cuss. Postponing it, therefore, for the moment, we may ask whether the difficulties of the relation between M and I, in Ward's account, may not readily be overcome without any fundamental alteration in the interpretation which he puts upon M and upon I respectively. Here (as has been suggested) there is at least a plaus ible way of escape. When M is bodily (however inward and, so to say, etherial its zone), it is "presented" and it is not I. We have to distinguish, in other words, between the</page><page sequence="16">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO IO5 sight of the mind and the movement of the eye, between our psychical feeling and the somatic resonance which wraps it as in a garment, between intellectual assent or denial and the opening or closing of the glottis. Anyone, at least, who believes that his mind is not a psychical entity or merely a function of breath and blood and nerves, is bound to draw these distinctions and to believe (as Ward does) that his "thinking and willing" (or "spiritual") self can be distinguished from any form of its corporal accom paniments. Supposing, then, that this restriction can be (and, in deed, must be) drawn, we might attempt to modify Ward's account somewhat as follows. There is an M, we should say, but this M is bodily, and it is not the "spiritual" self. On the other hand, this "spiritual" self is not merely intel lectual and volitional. It is also fanciful and desiring, per ceptual and appetitive. In other words, at all levels of M, apprehension, feeling and attention must be distinguished from their bodily accompaniments. These accompaniments are never spiritual ; the psychical processes which they ac company are always spiritual. I believe that this is what the plain man does mean by himself, and what he does distinguish (clearly enough in principle although with hesitation when he is cross-exam ined) from any zone or echo of his body. M, in other words, consists, on this view, of organic sensa and their echoes; and these are "presented" in the melange confus of mind and body. But M in any other sense is not "presented" (i. e., given as a sensible object) and need not be distinguished from I. In other words, attention and feeling, in their continuity, are the authentic I itself ; and if not the whole of it, at least an integral part. This is not Ward's theory; and of course it is at least as disputable as his. It pays regard to his distinctions, how</page><page sequence="17">io6 THE MONIST ever, is based upon a clear principle, and may perhaps be sustained. (3) The belief that neither the I nor its feeling and at tention can be "directly and immediately known" but, on the contrary, that these have to be inferred, indirectly and indeed intellectually, from their effects, is manifestly cen tral to the whole of Ward's analysis, and not the less so because he admits it to be a violent (if inescapable) para dox. Ultimately, however, the paradox and all its conse quences are inevitable, in his view, because the principle of them is indubitable. It has emerged, as we have seen, from the history of thought itself being "a more concrete state ment of what philosophers have very widely acknowledged in a more abstract form since the days of Kant-the im possibility of the subjective qua subjective being pre sented"31 and it seems plain that Ward, here even more than in other parts of his doctrine, keeps Kant in mind. It is fortunate, therefore (although not an accident) that in his Study of Kant he has dealt with the problem at what, in proportion, is a considerable length ; and to this we may turn. In this critical analysis Ward considers, first of all, Kant's doctrine of the "inner sense." Here the difficulty is that the "inner sense," if there were one, is not parallel to the "outer senses." In the latter the stimulation of a sense organ leads to awareness of a sense-datum. In the former there is no sense organ but the subject, on the con trary, would appear to affect itself.32 Again, our external senses are usually supposed to be differentiated from an original "sensus vagus" Kant, however, produces no evi dence of any such differentiation;33 and he could not, be cause "out of sensations as mere stuff, order and form can never arise: something ordering and informing is then 31 P., 58. 32 K., 141. 33 K., 143.</page><page sequence="18">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO 107 implied, and surely this something cannot be devoid of all spontaneity."34 The attempt to consider "inner" sense as temporal and the "outer" senses as spatial could not suc ceed. In short, Kant's two kinds of sensibility, the inter nal and the external, are not comparable and do not run on all fours."35 In the Analytic, the subject has the role of active synthe sis, and this function can never be given through objects, but, on the contrary, is presupposed when any object is given. This, Ward tells us, is "the central truth which we have to keep steadily before us"36 and refrain from confus ing, like Kant, with the supposed phenomena of an inner sense. We should also avoid some of the standing puzzles of Kant's Dialectic. The problem there was "to hold fast to the reality of the self without at the same time repudiat ing the doctrine of transcendental idealism, i. e., that the self is only "given" by an inner sense and so as phenom enal" but Kant persisted in regarding the Ego as "prob lematic"-a mere "as if"-because he persisted in treating the real subject of experience as an object, although his theory truly implied that the subject is the activity of syn thetic judgment itself. He vacillated in consequence be tween what he did not doubt and what (as he thought) he could not show ; and in the end was driven to the statement that the Ego is neither phenomenon nor noiimenon. Accord ing to Ward the only possible meaning of this statement is that "the Ego is in Aristotle's sense a substantial factor in experience not a mere attribute of it";38 and Ward con cludes that "apperception is not a "presented existence" . . . but the activity of a subject . . . and experience con sists in its interaction with objects which are presented existences. The two are correlative, but they do not stand 34 K.f 146 35 K., 147. 36 K., 150. 37 K., 163 s K., 170.</page><page sequence="19">io8 THE MONIST on a par. Nevertheless, Kant is continually attempting either to treat of them apart or to regard both as objects. Together (in experience) they cannot, however, both be objects alike given in sense-the subject merely as epiphe nomenon "attached" to or "accompanying" the phenomena of external sense. . . . Apart, on the other hand, they are but empty abstractions; and in that case, it is immaterial whether we designate them, like Locke, as a "something we knowr not what," or like Hume, as nothing that we do know at all."39 To this conclusion, and to the grounds for it, certain observations may be pertinent. (a) The self on any theory cannot be simply an object of sense (external or internal) to be taken in at a gulp by an single set of sensing. Even if it revealed itself to "inner sense" and were a "thing," it would still be an intellectual construction in the sense that we should require to think out the fleeting revelations of sense in terms of their refer ence to something relatively permanent. If there were an "inner sense," however, we might legitimately believe that we could obtain through it genuine if fragmentary revela tions of the "thing." (b) Sense organs, or the supposed derivation for a sim pler and vaguer condition, are at least extrinsic require ments or criteria of the fact of sensation. The "inner sense," therefore, if there were one, would not necessarily be annihilated by arguments based upon the supposed ab sence of these ; and if by "sense" we mean merely a direct unmediated acquaintance with existential fact, there would appear to be grounds for believing that our acquaintance with the forms and varieties of feeling and attention (as exemplified in the concrete instances of these which Ward supplies) is, in this interpretation of the words, either a sense or, as Locke says "very like it." 39 K.. 173-174.</page><page sequence="20">JAMES WARD'S ACCOUNT OF THE EGO IO9 (c) The absolute distinction (even if it is a differentia tion in unity) between subject and object, leading, as it does, to the conclusion that the "subject" can never be an "object" even to itself, may be disputed. Thus Bradley held that portions of the non-self might be assimilated by the self and vice-versa. More generally it does not seem evident that we cannot be immediately acquainted with feeling or attention. These may not confront us as a color does. Perhaps, even, they do not confront us as taste, or nausea, or as an aching tooth does. Nevertheless, we do seem aware of them; and to find them within us. To be acquainted with a thing, and to be acquainted with a thing as an object (in the wide sense in which "object" is used in these arguments) are perhaps nothing different from one another. In other words the sole question may be whether or not we are immediately acquainted, in a form which may lead to knowledge, with our psychical exist ence. Our own being, we may conclude, is primarily rather a reference to objects than itself an object. While it is itself it is not, in general, occupied with itself. Yet, as Arnauld used to say, we may always have a "virtual" ac quaintance with ourselves ; and if this virtual self-acquain tance (very partially, to be sure, but perhaps with immedi acy) becomes express self-acquaintance, it need not follow that we turn ourselves inside out, so to speak, in this proc ess, and can never observe what we are. (d) If "activity" be interpreted, not as a process with which we may be acquainted, but as the governing pre supposition of the whole subject-object duality, it is hard to see why it should have any special connection or affinity with either pole of this duality. In so far as "subjective being" is contrasted (within experience) with "objective being," the activity presupposed in both would seem, theo retically to be indifferent to either. Ward, as we have seen, while regarding "activity" in this light also allies it with</page><page sequence="21">no THE MONIST "subjective being"; but he does not, and cannot, give a reason. Per contra, if we could be acquainted with the processes we call striving, and if these were literally and actually phases of our activity, our "subjective being" might be partially recognized for what it is, in the way most of us assume to be possible. If not, feeling, attention, together with their modes and distinctions, would seem to be known only mediately; and there is no obvious connec tion between the results of this mediate knowledge and the other intellectual construction according to which (as Ward tells us) we "fit our being" into the "form" of an unpresentable activity presupposed by, but not authenti cally revealed in, the whole subject-object duality.

In the belief that there is no good reason for saying anything different now that Doctor Ward's eye can not reach these discussions (if indeed it be true that it cannot) I have left them as they stand. But I would like to express here my admiration for his moral and intellectual character and my deep regret at the calamity of his death. I never met a man so sincere in his aim or so sincere towards others; and his death is our loss and our great calamity although his years were ripe. For his intellectual force was not abated.-J.
