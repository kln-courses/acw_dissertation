<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alain Robbe-Grillet's La jalousie : Realism and the Ethics of Reading Zahi Zalloua Published in 1957, as the nouveau roman was rising on the Parisian liter- ary scene, Alain Robbe-Grillet's novel La Jalousie [Jealousy] produced in many of its first readers a reaction of puzzlement and consternation. One critic from the newspaper Le Monde believed that "he had surely received a copy whose pages had been mixed up by the printer, that it was a jum- bled mess" (qtd. in Robbe-Grillet "Order" 3). La Jalousie , in many ways, can be said to illustrate Robbe-Grillet's modernist, if not postmodernist, bias against classical realism and narration,1 his view that "tell[ing] a story has become strictly impossible [ raconter est devenu proprement impossi- ble] " (33). Making these remarks in an article aptly entitled "On Several Obsolete Notions," published the same year as La Jalousie and repub- lished a few years later in his influential 1963 manifesto For a New Novel , Robbe-Grillet made clear his intention to renovate both the novel form and the critical reading practices used in approaching the genre as a whole. Few readers answered Robbe-Grillet's call for a radicalization of the novel, however, and the question of how one can or should read La Jalousie's unruliness, its intentional challenge to hermeneutical contain- ment and cognitive mastery, still remains open. The question of how to re- spond to La Jalousie - a question that the novel itself allegorizes or stages in several key scenes - is not just an intellectual or epistemological chal- lenge but also an ethical one. The following pages re-examine the recep- JNT: Journal of Narrative Theory 38.1 (Winter 2008): 13-36.

Confronted with La Jalousie's unruliness, some critics in effect ig- nored it, proceeding with well-established modes of inquiry in an attempt to impose a fixed meaning on the text. In his 1963 work The Novels of Robbe-Grillet, Bruce Morrissette offered the first systematic and explana- tory study of the novel, basing his reading in part on the authority of its jacket blurb, which he faithfully paraphrased as follows: The story with its three characters - the husband, the wife, the presumed lover - is "narrated" by the husband, a tropi- cal planter who, from the vantage points in his banana plantation house, surrounded on three sides by its wide ve- randa, suspiciously keeps watch over his wife. (112-13) According to Morrissette, two chronologies control the novel's action: an external chronology (which is impossible to determine) and a chronology of the husband's psychological states. The novel's disconcerting chrono- logical impasses can be explained as symptoms of the inner psychic unity governing the order of the novel's events. This psychic unity ultimately refers us to a stable, coherent subject, to a readable subject/text, one situ- ated in the tradition of the psychological novel. La Jalousie's initial dis- turbing effects are thus eliminated through a critical re-reading, one which restores the comforting sense of comprehension and mastery. Prioritizing referential interpretation does not necessarily lead to a psy- chological reading of La Jalousie, however. In his 1973 Lecture politique du roman [Political Reading of the Novel], Jacques Leenhardt proposed a compelling sociological analysis of the novel, unsettling Morrissette's in- fluential contention that La Jalousie is about erotic jealousy and, more specifically, about the psychic reality of a jealous husband. Leenhardt's reading purports to make visible what in Frederic Jameson's terms can be described as La Jalousie's "material and referential preconditions " (169, emphasis original). Privileging the social, in turn, enables the reader to es- cape the all-too-common psychologization of the husband in order to bet- ter attest to his ideological subject position. Leenhardt reads the novel</page><page sequence="3">Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 15 allegorically as a textual site of tension between two competing colonial models: the husband, who stands for the old racist French empire, and the new, more utilitarian, neocolonial model, allegorized in the figure of Franck (25-26). On Leenhardt's account, the motor of the story is not erotic jealousy per se, but the husband's fear of losing his material possessions and patri- archal privilege. The narrator's obsessive, depersonalized gaze, for in- stance, is not merely an index of the husband's isolated pathology; rather, it reflects the anxieties of late French colonialism on the eve of the 1960 accessions to independence in West Africa. Leenhardt historicizes the Cartesian subject and its desire for control, situating this subject (embod- ied here by the husband) in the early moments of decolonization, an era that confirmed the death of a traditional French imperialism based on ter- ritorial conquest and control, while also witnessing a rise in neocolonial capitalist systems of domination.2 On this reading, the narrator-husband's obsessive gaze, exemplified in his geometrical descriptions of his banana plantation - for example, "The bulge of the bank also begins to take effect starting from the fifth row: this row, as a matter of fact, also possesses only twenty-one trees, whereas it should have twenty-two for a true trapezoid and twenty-three for a rectangle (uneven row)" - is symptomatic of his uneasiness and loss of footing in the changing field of power (52). "Against the backdrop of a waning colonialism, this morbid geometraliza- tion takes on a clear ideological meaning," Leenhardt concludes (55, my translation). For Leenhardt, neither La Jalousie 's textual self-reflexivity nor its psychological realism should blind the reader to the novel's histor- ical context or its ideological content. Accordingly, La Jalousie's realism, or its epistemological claims about the referential world, lies not so much in the evocation of the narrator's psychic reality than in the novel's repre- sentation of a colonial mentality, or more precisely, in its staging of the ideological tension inherent in the devolution and devaluation of Western colonialism. Already in 1959, however, literary critic and novelist Maurice Blan- chot was warning against such an ideological and neo-referential reading of the novel; that is, a reading in which the primary goal is to explicate and domesticate Robbe-Grillet's unruly narration by imposing a hermeneutical order, an attempt at mastery that raises both aesthetic and ethical ques- tions. In The Book to Come, Blanchot not only questions the primacy of</page><page sequence="4">16 INT the husband's jealousy, but also problematizes the very existence of such a central character. Taking objection, in particular, to the jacket blurb's char- acterization of the narrator as a jealous husband, Blanchot underscores the novel's radical alterity, its irreducibility to a thematic analysis and its de- parture from pre-existing literary models. More importantly, noting the "powerful absence [at] the center of the plot and of the narration," he re- minds the reader that no character is ever in fact named as the narrator and that what we have instead is an absent /: According to the critics, we are to understand that what is speaking in this absence is the very character of the jealous one, the husband who watches over his wife. I think this misunderstands the authentic reality of this narrative as the reader is invited to approach it. The reader indeed feels that something is missing; he has the premonition that it is this lack that allows everything to be said and everything to be seen - but how could this lack be identified with someone? How could there still be a name and an identity there? It is nameless, faceless; it is pure anonymous presence. (261nl) For Blanchot, the anonymity of the narrative voice reflects the demands of writing and crystallizes the singular experience of literature, that is, litera- ture's resistance to readerly cognitive demands: "The essence of literature is precisely to escape any essential determination, any assertion that stabi- lizes it or even realizes it: it is never already there, it always has to be re- discovered or reinvented" (201). The event of literature not only frustrates comprehension, but also alters and dispossesses its readers: "it is what di- vests me of myself and of any being, just as it makes language no longer what speaks but what is; language becomes the idle profundity of being, the domain where the word becomes being but does not signify and does not reveal" (208). In The Thought from Outside (1966), Michel Foucault similarly underscores the non-instrumentality of literary language, the way that (modernist) literature is no longer discourse and the communication of meaning, but a spreading forth of language in its raw state, an un- folding of pure exteriority. And the subject that speaks is less the responsible agent of a discourse (what holds it,</page><page sequence="5">Alain R obbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 17 what uses it to assert and judge, what sometimes represents itself by means of a grammatical form designed to have that effect) than a non-existence in whose emptiness the unending outpouring of language uninterruptedly contin- ues. (11) The event of literature is an exposure to the outside, to the raw being of language, the experience of language as a dissolution: "the being of lan- guage only appears for itself with the disappearance of the subject" (15). La Jalousie likewise allegorizes this Blanchotian experience: the chal- lenge to decipher and displace the authorial, masterful "I" with the anonymity of language. During a conference on the status of the nouveau roman in the fall of 1982 at New York University, Robbe-Grillet responded directly to Blan- chot's concerns about the jacket blurb, as well as the type of readings that it authorizes: Blanchot was right. I wrote to him that he was right, but that it was I who had written this blurb and that, in fact, it was not intended for him, but for those hurried critics who do not have time to read the books they have to write about in papers. The blurb was, of course, not addressed to Mau- rice Blanchot who, in the cell of his tower, actually reads books, (qtd. in Oppenheim 26, emphasis added) Those who actually read the book, moving beyond the jacket to the text it- self, immediately encounter its narrative unruliness, an unruliness that raises a number of perplexing questions: How does one perform a reading of, or a commentary on, La Jalousie without, at the same time, assimilat- ing it to an economy of the Same? If the ethical relation with the other is fundamentally irreducible to a relation of knowledge (in which the other becomes merely an object of contemplation or comprehension),3 how does one think La Jalousie's realism otherwise than being ? In Totality and Infinity , Emmanuel Levinas locates the ethical moment in the face-to-face encounter with the other, which is described as a mo- ment of cognitive frustration - the other's face " exceedfs ] the idea of the other in me " - an encounter that brings into question the autonomy, spon-</page><page sequence="6">18 INT taneity, and self-sufficiency of the self (50). What the face of the other does is interrupt the self's habitual economy, the self's tendency to reduce otherness to the order of the Same. But the other, for Levinas, is infinite, irreducible to my comprehension: the other is not a being, not an object to be known, mastered, and possessed. To read La Jalousie otherwise than being, then, is an attempt to extend the Levinasian ethical relation beyond the face-to-face encounter with the human other to the domain of literary hermeneutics, expanding ethics to include the reader's relation to the work of art. Faced with La Jalousie's unruliness, the reader confronts a "double bind," a hermeneutical hesitation between two conflicting injunctions: the simultaneous thematization of and recognition of textual opacity. It is pre- cisely in this productive tension, however, that an alternative reading - or an "ethics of reading" - can begin to emerge. While ethics and literature have long enjoyed a complementary rela- tion among critics in the Aristotelian tradition, such as Wayne Booth and Martha Nussbaum,4 since the late twentieth century there has been an at- tempt to think of the relation between ethics and literature differently, to take up an ethical approach that would recognize the specificity or "singu- larity of literature," to borrow Derek Attridge's suggestive formulation. Attridge contends that "to find oneself reading an inventive work is to find oneself subject to certain obligations - to respect its otherness, to respond to its singularity, to avoid reducing it to the familiar and the utilitarian even while attempting to comprehend by relating it to these" (130). His notion of an inventive work recalls Barthes's ideal of a writerly text - a lit- erary work whose goal is "to make the reader no longer a consumer, but a producer of a text" (S/Z 4). Unlike a readerly text - a text that "can be read, but not written" - a writerly text transforms its reader into a partner or coauthor (4). An inventive work clearly shares the writerly text's inex- haustibility,5 as well as its resistance to the reader's voracious appetite (or " comfortable practice of reading"), in the way that it confounds readerly expectations ( Pleasure 14). But an inventive work does not privilege hermeneutical agency, which risks glorifying the reader as a producer of meaning. Nor does it indulge the reader's eroticized fantasies: "the text is a fetish object, and this fetish desires me," writes Barthes in The Pleasure of the Text (27). Unlike the writerly text, which pleases the reader by sub- mitting to his or her desires ("What I enjoy in a narrative is not directly its content or even its structure," contends Barthes, "but rather the abrasions I</page><page sequence="7">Alain R obbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 19 impose upon the fine surface: I read on, I skip, I look up, I dip in again"), the inventive work elicits an ethical response (12). It calls upon the reader not only to produce and delight in potentially endless interpretations of the text, but also to respect its otherness, to sustain its singularity, and to resist the narcissistic assumption that it exists purely for oneself. Complicating the Barthesian model of a passive/active reading with two types of read- ers, consumer and producer, the inventive work requires a reconceptual- ization of both terms, a reading that perpetually hesitates between making sense of, and preserving an openness to, the work's alterity and altering effects. An ethics of reading, in its Levinasian inflection, thus prioritizes the literary work's alterity and the need to renew or retain that alterity. Such an ethics is no longer limited to the interpretation of a novel's content (what it teaches us through examples and counter-examples), nor even to its context. Rather, it pertains fundamentally to receptivity, to the ways in which the reader listens to the text's demands and responds to its Saying (le Dire), attending to that which resists and interrupts the determination of meaning, disrupting any given horizon of intelligibility, the Said (le Dit) of literary criticism. At the heart of the controversy surrounding the reception of La Jalousie lies the perception of its mimetic intent, since its "retrievability" or recuperability depends on the extent to which one views it as inviting or refusing referential interpretation.6 And it is precisely against the tendency to read literature as a representation of a referential or extra-textual world that the polemical theorist Jean Ricardou conceptualized the nouveau roman less in terms of the "writing of an adventure" than in terms of the "adventure of writing" (111). Historically speaking, La Jalousie belongs to the first wave of the nouveau roman , in which mimetic or realist con- cerns were not a priori ruled out. Indeed, first- wave writers tended to priv- ilege a phenomenological relation to the external world. Speaking for the new novelists, Robbe-Grillet vacillates between (and conflates) two ver- sions of realism: an objective realism (which accords primacy to objects) and a subjective one (stressing the primacy of perception). At times, he considers the anthropomorphization of the world an anathema to the aes- thetics of the nouveau roman. Yearning to escape from nineteenth-century Balzacian realism and its "tyranny" of signification, he underscores in cat- egorical terms the neutrality of the external world: "[T]he world is neither</page><page sequence="8">20 I N T significant nor absurd. It is, quite simply. . . . Man looks at the world, and the world does not look back at him" ( For a New Novel 19, 58). Barthes, commenting on Robbe-Grillet's cinematic realism, notes: "The author's entire art is to give the object a Dasein, a 'being-there,' and to strip it of a 'being-something'" ( Critical Essays 15).7 Yet at other times, Robbe-Gril- let underscores the subjective character of realism, privileging the individ- ual's fragmented, precarious, and contingent perception of reality: Man is present on every page, in every line, in every word. Even if many objects are presented and are described with great care, there is always, and especially, the eye which sees them, the thought which examines them, the passion which distorts them. The objects in our novels never have a presence outside human perception, real or imaginary. . . . In our books, ... it is a man who sees, who feels, who imagines, a man located in space and time, conditioned by his passions, a man like you and me. And the book reports nothing but his experience, limited and uncertain as it is. It is a man here, now, who is his own narrator, finally. ( For a New Novel, 137-39) Both versions of realism are noticeably manifest in La Jalousie , from the husband's camera-like recording of events to his unreliable, hallucinatory recollections. These multiple ways of enacting realism are so pervasive that they have led one critic to ask: "[A]re the construction of the novel and the description of objects and events to be read as signs of a deform- ing vision, or as objective representations of a material and non-signifying world?" (Jefferson 136). Later novels by Robbe-Grillet and other New Novelists conform more or less to Ricardou's formalist, aesthetic sensibility, ostensibly doing away with mimetic concerns in favor of postmodern anti-realism. Robbe-Gril- let's preoccupation with a purely self-reflexive textuality is already appar- ent in La Jalousie, however. The most obvious example is the word jalousie, which in French signifies both "jealousy" and "Venetian blind." The two disparate meanings of the word can be linked insofar as the reader postulates a jealous husband spying on his wife through the slats of a window blind. Yet by choosing this ambiguous, multivalent title, Robbe- Grillet twists meanings and destabilizes representations, implicitly cau-</page><page sequence="9">Alain R obbe-Grillet's La lalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 21 tioning his readers against subscribing to any one totalizing approach - be it mimetic or self-reflexive.8 Likewise, Robbe-Grillet both grants and de- nies us access to the narrator-husband. Through the process of what Kaja Silverman calls "heteropathic identification," which enacts "an ethical or nonviolent relation to the other" by simultaneously soliciting and blocking empathic identification, Robbe-Grillet's novel creates the possibility of a referential reading that is otherwise than being (23, 3). Such a reading does not deny, absorb or flatten the subversive elements and discursive possibilities of his ecriture by positing and affirming a reality prior to or unaltered by the novel's textual performance. Respecting La Jalousie 's inventiveness, sustaining its generic unruli- ness, requires, then, an interpretive oscillation between mimetic and self- reflexive modes of interpretation. Morrissette's analysis, which patholo- gizes the husband's narrative, does not account for the interpretive hesitation elicited by the text, nor how such a hesitation works to safe- guard the uniqueness and otherness of the narrative voice rather than fore- closing our exposure to it. Fearing the narrative's contaminating potential, Morrissette warns against the reader's passive fusion with the narrator, his or her desire to "coincide" with the husband's consciousness. He encour- ages his readers to re-impose textual mastery over the narrative by differ- entiating themselves from the jealous husband: We must constantly separate ourselves from this jealous husband that we become as we read, whose tormenting emotion we share, whose perceptions and ideas haunt us, who drags us with him into his eternal cycle of obsessive visions that annihilates all chronology. It becomes neces- sary, in a word, for the reader, having become a man sick with jealousy, to be cured of his disease, to be brought back to normal. (117) Morrissette's ideal reader is one who renounces or overcomes the identifi- cation with the husband-narrator. Yet this abjection still does not reflect an ethical sensibility, only a defensive strategy - one originating from the de- sire to safeguard the autonomy and sovereignty of the reader's ego from the text's pathological discourse, its threat of displacement. On this ac- count, for the reader to be cured of such contamination, he or she would</page><page sequence="10">22 ] N T have to separate facts from fiction, perception from imagination, unprob- lematically. Even if Morrissette acknowledges the difficulty or impossibil- ity of this interpretive task, the imperative to normalize, which is synony- mous with the pursuit of intelligibility, itself distorts the text with its demands for clarity: "To salvage and place, with any degree of exactitude, the 'facts' of the plot of Jealousy in chronological order, it becomes nec- essary to clarify the images seen in the distorting mirror of the husband's vision, in which events and objects are caught and reflected" (117). This jealousy thus becomes a purely psychological matter, something to eluci- date, contain, and correct in order for genuine acts of comprehension to take place. However, jealousy in this text is an ontological experience, not simply a psychological one; it is an uncanny event that radically disturbs the nar- rator's memory and narrative, altering his perception and relation to the external world, an experience akin to Blanchot's notion of fascination, which is foremost a challenge to the autonomy of consciousness. In The Space of Literature (1955), Blanchot argues, "What fascinates us robs us of our power to give sense. It abandons its 'sensory' nature, abandons the world, draws back from the world, and draws us along. It no longer re- veals itself to us, yet it affirms itself in a presence foreign to the temporal present and to presence in space" (32). Regaining in La Jalousie the strong etymological sense of "charm" or "enchantment," fascination renders problematic the classic Cartesian opposition of subject and object, as well as models of perception based on a clear separation between the two. "It can be said," writes Blanchot, "that a person who is fascinated does not perceive any real object, any real form, because what he sees does not be- long to the world of reality, but to the indeterminate realm of fascination" (32). The fascinated subject par excellence is, of course, the writer. He or she is obsessed with and overwhelmed by language, for "to write is to let fascination rule language" (33). Far from upholding the romantic view of the author as demiurge, the absolute source of meaning, Blanchot repeat- edly points to the disempowerment of the literary process: The writer's mastery is not in the hand that writes, the "sick" hand that never lets the pencil go - that can't let go because what it holds it doesn't really hold; . . . Mastery al-</page><page sequence="11">Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 23 ways characterizes the other hand, the one that doesn't write and is capable of intervening at the right moment to seize the pencil and put it aside. Thus power consists in the power to stop writing, to interrupt what is being written, thereby restoring to the present instant its rights, its deci- sive trenchancy. (25) Analogous to fascination, jealousy - as it is staged in Robbe-Grillet's novel - is a figure of dispossession; it is what robs the narrator's gaze of its habitual sense of power, what makes the narrator's objectivizing con- sciousness fail to contain the objects that fall within its horizon of intelli- gibility. This alienation is illustrated in what is perhaps the most famous scene of the novel: the crushing of the centipede by Franck, a neighbor and fel- low plantation owner, who is suspected of having an adulterous affair with the wife, A . . . . This "primal" scene, the one which the reader is invited to reconstruct from the numerous fragmented descriptions, takes place in the dining room. When Franck bravely kills the centipede upsetting A . . . , he boldly usurps the husband's power, undermining his position as dutiful protector of his wife/possession. The overtly sexual description of A ... 's hand clenching the knife handle, a phallic symbol, further highlights the husband's emasculation. The image of the centipede (and the stain that it leaves on the wall) haunts the narrator, who continually re-imagines the scene. His most dramatic fantasy emerges after A . . . accompanies Franck on a shopping trip while he looks for a new truck. Left alone on his plan- tation, the narrator becomes obsessed by the image of the centipede in the Blanchotian sense; his fascination is "a passion for the image" (32), a fer- vent desire or zeal (jealousy is itself etymologically derived from the an- cient Greek zelos) for an object that lies beyond his mastery.9 The image's unruly plasticity reaches its apogee when the centipede - said earlier to be "of average size" (64) - becomes transmuted into a monstrous insect: "It is enormous: one of the largest to be found in this climate. With its long antennae and its huge legs spread on each side of its body, it covers the area of an ordinary plate" (112). It is as if the image becomes imbued with agency, just as the narrator becomes devoid of his. In this Kafkaesque ren- dering of the scene, not only the centipede, but also the location of the event, have undergone a radical transformation: as if caught in flagrante</page><page sequence="12">24 J N T delecto, A . . . and Franck have been transported to a hotel room, in a scene that the narrator-husband appears to be imagining, and not, strictly speaking, perceiving. Nevertheless, contradicting Robbe-Grillet's ideal vi- sion of the real as something that can be experienced in a pure, immediate state (as he describes it in For a New Novel), the episode is related in the present tense, in a disturbing conflation of perception and imagination that reflects the inaccessibility of the real. According to Robbe-Grillet's manifesto, perception, this "cleansing power of the sense of sight," should enable the subject to describe things as they are ("neither significant nor absurd") and leave "things in their re- spective place" (. For a New Novel 73). If perception truly had a cleansing function, however, the narrator's representation of the centipede should re- main constant in each retelling of the episode instead of falling prey to the husband's distorting, anthropomorphic hallucinations. The centipede should have simply been, in the words of Barthes, "an optical resistance" (Critical 14); instead it fails to conform to the phenomenological tenets that Robbe-Grillet himself favors in his essays. La Jalousie thus confirms the insights of its Sartrean predecessor, La Nausee [ Nausea ] (1938), a text that crystallizes any given narrator's inability to control the threatening external world through perception.10 The protagonist of this novel, Roquentin, successfully rejects the imposition of bourgeois meaning on the world, but fails to give an unmediated phenomenological account of his surroundings. The climatic moment of the novel is one of fascination: transfixed by the roots of a chestnut tree he has been observing, Roquentin has a sudden "vision" or "illumination" that he depicts as an epiphany: "And suddenly, suddenly, the veil is torn away, I have understood, I have seen" (126-27). Roquentin indicates that this illuminating experience is pre- verbal, only narrated after the fact: "The word absurdity is coming to life under my pen; a little while ago, in the garden, I couldn't find it, but neither was I looking for it, I did not need it: I thought without words, on things, with things" (129). This experience is, however, as much textual as it is metaphysical, a fact betrayed by his Blanchotian fascination with words and abundant use of metaphors for the tree, which, described as a "wooden serpent," "claw," and "vulture's talon" (129), undergoes a lin- guistic metamorphosis akin to the transformations of La Jalousie's cen- tipede.</page><page sequence="13">Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 25 Like the bouts of nausea that alter Roquentin's relation to the world, the bouts of jealousy in Robbe-Grillet's work render the narrator's relation to the real highly problematic, especially the unmediated apprehension of it. What La Nausee and La Jalousie have in common, then, is a certain dramatization of the relation between the subject and object of conscious- ness. Both novels foreground the evacuation of the Cartesian, as well as the phenomenological subject, or in Foucauldian terms, "the death of man."11 Shortly after the chestnut episode, when his bouts of nausea and his fascination with external objects have momentarily subsided, Roquentin comes to doubt the actual experience at the public park: "Had I dreamed of this enormous presence?" (134). Removed from the event, Roquentin re-emerges as a narrating subject, albeit one whose agency is precarious at best. In La Jalousie, Robbe-Grillet pushes the breakdown of the subject/object boundaries even further, taking as a point of departure a husband who is denied a first-person pronoun, thus problematizing the very possibility of a contrast between a fascinated state and a non-fasci- nated one (a contrast La Nausee upholds, as Roquentin moves from mo- ments of enchanted self-dissolution to moments of controlled self-con- sciousness and back). The being of the husband-narrator is not only linguistically absent (marked by the absence of an "I"), but also fasci- nated, robbed of its sovereignty, stripped of the possessive quality of in- tentionality. Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie, even more than its predecessor, illustrates and performs the unruliness of consciousness (an unruliness heightened by jealousy) and underscores the difficulty that such unruliness poses both for reflection and for narration. This resistance to narrative control reaches its peak at the very moment when the husband attempts to restore a presiding subjectivity over his property and wife by fantasizing about her death during her ride with Franck: In his haste to reach his goal, Franck increases his speed. . . . In the darkness, he has not seen the hole running halfway across the road. The car makes a leap, skids. ... On this bad road the driver cannot straighten out in time. The blue sedan goes crashing into a roadside tree whose rigid foliage scarcely shivers under the impact, despite its violence. The</page><page sequence="14">26 INT car immediately bursts into flames. The whole brash is illu- minated by the crackling, spreading fire. (113-14) Expressing his desire to punish A . . . and her lover for their betrayal, the narrator imagines a sort of divine retribution for his suffering. While it is tempting to see this wish as an (unconscious) desire on the part of the nar- rator to restore control over his chaotic world, the stability or order that he establishes is short lived, since, through a kind of free association, he moves from the "crackling fire," to the "sound the centipede makes" as it crushed against the wall, to the sound of A ... 's hairbrush "moving down [her] loosened hair" (114). Ironically, imagination thwarts, rather than abets, the husband's sadistic desires, quickly eluding his authorial control. The scenes following this episode hint at the possibility of closure but then thwart that facile form of resolution. The narrator's obsession with the couple's day trip appears to wane upon their return, for example, when his fantasy confronts the reality of their presence. The reader, like the husband, does not know for certain what has actually transpired between A . . . and Franck, although questions surrounding Franck's "mechanical troubles" suggest that he fails is not only mechanically but amorously, a link which A . . . makes more explicit in her comparison of engines to women (127, 129). An ambiguous reference to a "dark liquid," which is later depicted in even more suggestive language as a "reddish streak," sug- gests that foul play ensues (111, 134). Yet the plausibility of such a tragic ending is itself quickly invalidated on the next page when A . . . observes that "[t]he spot has always been there, on the wall. For the moment there is no question of repainting anything but the blinds and the balustrade - the latter a bright yellow. That is what A . . . has decided" (135). 12 The cir- cular structure of the novel ultimately problematizes any definitive sense of closure, halting any movement from textual obscurity to interpretive clarity. Moreover, in the absence of a linear unfolding of the narrator's jealousy, we could say that the reader enters the state of jealousy, itself a state of anxiety and irresolution, in medias res. La Jalousie demands that the reader be alert to its fundamental resis- tance to comprehension, its defiance of hermeneutic commentary or sym- bolic mastery; yet, at the same time, the reader must also counterbalance and supplement that Blanchotian reverence for the text - its irreducible otherness - with an actual interpretation of the events, thus crafting his or</page><page sequence="15">A lain R obbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 27 her own interpretation of La Jalousie , if only provisionally. While any such interpretation of La Jalousie can be said to betray the novel (just as would any recuperative deciphering of the text's meaning and "secrets"),13 a reading of the novel that is otherwise than being seems imperative, how- ever impossible. If critics like Morrissette and Leenhardt interpret the novel numerically or referentially (as a story about a jealous husband or as an allegory of political struggle), Blanchot, as we have seen, denies the novel's mimetic intent altogether, interpreting the narrative voice as a fig- ure for the anonymity of language itself. It is arguably only Blanchot's ac- count, in its refusal "to think of reading as either appropriation or domina- tion," that takes La Jalousie's alterity and literariness seriously (Gibson 192). In The Writing of the Disaster , Blanchot contrasts the type of active reading practiced by Morrissette and Leenhardt with a more ethical mode of listening,14 one that preserves the irreducible distance between the reader and the work: There is an active, productive way of reading which pro- duces text and reader and thus transports us. There is a pas- sive kind of reading which betrays the text while appearing to submit to it, by giving the illusion that the text exists ob- jectively, fully, sovereignly: as one whole. Finally, there is the reading that is no longer passive , but is passivity's reading. It is without pleasure , without joy; it escapes both comprehension and desire . It is like the nocturnal vigil, that "inspiring" insomnia when, all having been said, "Saying" [le Dire ] is heard, and the testimony of the last witness is pronounced. (101, emphasis added) In this passage, Blanchot evokes the Levinasian notion of the Saying - that which is prior to or beyond meaning, that which "cannot be reduced to a constative description" (Critchley 7) - a form of reading that "does not com- prehend (strictly speaking)," but "attends" ( Infinite Conversation 320). To be sure, the act of comprehension involves a degree of violence in the hermeneutical gesture of grasping (com -prendre) the narrative. Yet in presenting the reader with two opposing modalities of reading, Blanchot rules out the possibility of a different kind of comprehension and, by ex- tension, a different kind of ethics. Most importantly, while Blanchot's call</page><page sequence="16">28 INT to respect the Saying of the text is Levinasian, it ignores how Levinas himself productively complicates this ethical notion. For Levinas, the choice that one must make is never simply a choice between Saying and the Said, between ethics and epistemology. Levinas constantly returns to the ways that philosophy interrogates itself in unsaying and resaying the ontological Said: "The greatest virtue of philosophy is that it can put itself into question, try to deconstruct what it has constructed, and unsay what it has said" ("Dialogue" 58). The same holds true for literary criticism: an ethics of reading never confers a work closure (the determination of its Said) but keeps returning to its Saying, to its inexhaustibility. An ethical reading of La Jalousie, then, does not opt for non-meaning over meaning, a "letting-go" over "active engagement" (Attridge 130); rather, it dili- gently attends to the text's irresolution, an irresolution that requires a con- tinual return to the ever-inventive work. The novel itself stages this return to the text, foregrounding the prob- lematic of irresolution, in two of its numerous mises en abyme : the native song and the African novel that both A . . . and Franck have been reading. Juxtaposing competing models of interpretation in these episodes, the text throws into question the viability of either. The native song is a complete challenge to comprehension, with no identifiable meaning; it is described as a "native tune [un air indigene ], with incomprehensible words, or even without words" (83). The song sparks the narrator's curiosity; he wonders about its internal logic, while recognizing the melody's intrinsic opacity ("it is difficult to determine if the song is interrupted for some fortuitous reason ... or whether the tune has come to its natural conclusion" [83]). The narrator also suggests that his experience of its opacity is due, at least in part, to his own cultural horizon of expectation: The poem is at moments so little like what is ordinarily called a song, a complaint, a refrain, that the western lis- tener is justified in wondering if something quite different is involved. The sounds, despite apparent repetitions, do not seem related by any musical law. There is no tune, re- ally, no melody, no rhythm. It is as if the man were content to utter unconnected fragments as an accompaniment to his work. (127, translation modified)15</page><page sequence="17">Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 29 From the position of the westerner, the song appears unintelligible, be- yond interpretation, as if the song's Saying and literariness are intimately tied to its agrammaticality - its lack of conformity to "musical law." In fact, the song-poem is profoundly anti-representational, devoid of any constative utterances (utterances of which the truth or falsity can be deter- mined), since it does not describe nor communicate anything about the world. Such is true of La Jalousie itself, which remains utterly inaccessi- ble. If the reader's subject position parallels that of the narrator, then any reading of the novel (realist or anti-realist) would effectively be ruled out: the reader confronts a text that is wholly other. The African novel also draws attention to the interpretive act - the event of reading. Thematically analogous to La Jalousie, the novel tells the story of an adulterous wife and her negligent husband. Like La Jalousie, it also displays a lack of verisimilitude and a potential to gen- erate multiple readings. Interpretive differences between Franck and A . . . emerge for example with respect to female sexuality. Franck finds one female character's sexual escapades shocking, while A . . . does not: "After all," he says, "sleeping with Negroes . . ." A . . . turns toward him, raises her chin, and asks smilingly: "Well, why not?" (126) In contending that women can sleep with whomever they choose, A . . . sets herself apart from Franck, implicitly refusing to conform to his desire to control or possess her fully. At other points, however, she and Franck take pleasure in the novel's ability to outrage and spark imagination: They . . . sometimes deplore the coincidences of the plot, saying that "things don't happen that way," and then they construct a different probable outcome starting from a new supposition, "if it weren't for that." Other possibilities are offered, during the course of the book, which lead to differ- ent endings. . . . They seem to enjoy multiplying these choices, exchanging smiles, carried away by their enthusi- asm, probably a little intoxicated by this proliferation. (75) This interpretive play is short lived: Franck reestablishes hermeneutical order, putting an end to textual jouissance and interpretive "intoxication":</page><page sequence="18">30 J N T "Franck sweeps away in a single gesture all the suppositions they had just constructed together. It's no use making up contrary possibilities, since things are the way they are: reality stays the same" (75). Unlike the native song, then, the African novel both produces and re- solves interpretive anxieties - at least for Franck. What is the reader to make of these two models of reading? Each one serves to illustrate the two extreme poles of interpretation: the native song is unreadable, whereas the African novel is all too hermeneutically containable. At which end of the interpretive pole do we situate La Jalousie ? Or is the question itself mis- placed? Some critics, wanting to underscore the poetics of La Jalousie against its thematics or psychological preoccupations (which others use to recuperate the novel under the label of realism), have understandably stressed its proximity to the native song-poem. As Ann Jefferson writes, for example, "In reading the narrative as the expression of the husband's jealousy, we are making it impossible to read it as a 'poem,' as literature" (139). Yet this type of reading also restricts La Jalousie's literariness, defining it too narrowly as poetry, a reified, self-enclosed aesthetic object, impenetrable to the reader's interpretive and appropriating gaze. As Jame- son cautions, "the very concept of the work of art qua aesthetic object is it- self a fetishization and an abstraction" (177). To situate La Jalousie be- yond any cognitive horizon - a consequence of identifying the novel purely with the poem-song - is to mystify and reify the (non)meaning of Robbe-Grillet's text - and thus to arrest the ethics of hesitation elicited by the novel under the pretence of safeguarding its literariness, its alterity. Reading the native song along with (rather than against) the African novel gives a fuller account of the ways that the novel allegorizes and stages its own irresolution, and might offer in turn a more ethical approach to La Jalousie. If we shift focus from the intrinsic properties of the song- poem to its horizon of intelligibility, then a rapprochement can be made with the African novel. The two models are not mutually exclusive, for both highlight the relational quality of otherness. That is to say, the alterity of the song-poem and the African novel is not affirmed in abstraction, but experienced as a rupture, a textual disturbance, relative to listener-readers' understanding and expectations. The native song is perceived as other mainly because it disrupts the husband-narrator's familiarity with music; similarly, the excitement that the African novel initially provokes stems from its ability to unsettle A . . . and Franck's expectations ("things don't</page><page sequence="19">Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Etfiics of Reading 31 happen that way")- When Franck strips the African novel of its inventive- ness, denying its reception "as an other that opens up new possibilities," he effectively destroys the experience of the novel's alterity, along with its transformative potential, returning it to the logic of the same and re-in- scribing the text within the established norms of readability (Attridge 49). If Franck serves as an example to avoid, the ethical reader of La Jalousie cannot simply negate this mode of reading or posit the text outside the realm of interpretation. As Robbe-Grillet himself put it, a text that could theoreti- cally "escape from this system of recuperation . . . would not be an interest- ing text, because it would be an angelical text, that is, a text which is in and for itself. One cannot be outside of ideology" ("Order" 18-19). The danger of simply upholding the otherness of La Jalousie is that conceiving of it as pure alterity - as an "angelic text" - falsifies it, denying it any impact on the reader. As an alternative, Robbe-Grillet proposes the open dialectic, whereby the readerly impulses of order and disorder interact playfully to create a productive tension, "a sort of mutual recuperation" (11). Such a practice is not inimical to realist readings of La Jalousie ; rather, it elicits an ethics of hesitation, unsettling the reader's ideological and hermeneutical habits. And it is in this spirit that we can interpret La Jalousie, alternating between mastery over and reverence for the text. Preserving the irresolution at the heart of novel does not require the reader to retreat into a paralyzing, skeptical void, remaining silent or simply affirming the unsayability of the text - the Blanchotian temptation. On the contrary, readers must co-opt the unruly text, inevitably betraying its inexhaustibility. The ethical reader can, however, reduce this betrayal by diligently attending to the moments of self- reflexivity, fascination, and dispossession that give pause in La Jalousie - moments, if you will, that resist thematization, prolong readerly intoxica- tion, and demand reconsideration.16 Notes 1. Robbe-Grillet's main target here is Balzac's nineteenth-century brand of realism, which assumes a God-like narrator: "Who is describing the world in Balzac's novels? Who is that omniscient, omnipresent narrator appearing everywhere at once, simulta- neously seeing the outside and the inside of things, following both the movements of a face and the impulses of conscience, knowing the present, the past, and the future of</page><page sequence="20">32 J N T every enterprise? It can only be a God" ( For a New Novel 138-39). For a useful con- textualization of the nouveau roman , see Edmund Smyth's "The Nouveau Roman" 2. While the novel's geographical location is never stated, it is reasonable to assume from the description of the climate and vegetation that it most likely takes place in the Caribbean or Africa. 3. See Levinas, Otherwise than Being , or, Beyond Essence. 4. See, for example, Wayne Booth, The Company We Keep: An Ethics of Fiction , and Martha Nussbaum, Love 's Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature. 5. As Barthes notes, "This text is a galaxy of signifiers, not a structure of signifieds; it has no beginning; it is reversible; we gain access to it by several entrances, none of which can be authoritatively declared to be the main one; the codes it mobilizes extend as far as the eye can reach, they are indeterminable (meaning here is never subject to a prin- ciple of determination, unless by throwing dice); the systems of meaning can take over this absolutely plural text, but their number is never closed, based as it is on the infin- ity of language" ( S/Z 5-6). 6. La Jalousie is in this respect exemplary of Robbe-Grillet's novels, which as Stephen Heath points out, are "to be read at the level of their irretrievability, precisely, that is, at the level at which reading is posed as a problem and explored as such" (67). 7. This emphasis on objects earned Robbe-Grillet the label of an anti-humanist chosiste (thing-oriented, or chose-ohented in French), from Barthes among others. 8. Similarly, Luicen Dallenbach interprets La Jalousie as foreclosing any privileged or monolithic approach to the novel: "We do not have to choose here between a phenom- enological (realistic) reading and a formal one ... it would be reductive and anachro- nistic only to consider one of them" (131). 9. Before Robbe-Grillet, Marcel Proust had recorded the devastating and disrupting ef- fects of jealousy: "It is one of the faculties of jealousy," writes the narrator of Remem- brance of Things Past , "to reveal to us the extent to which the reality of external facts and the sentiments of the heart are an unknown element which lends itself to endless suppositions. We suppose that we know exactly what things are and what people think, for the simple reason that we do not care about them. But as soon as we feel the desire to know, which the jealous man feels, then it becomes a dizzy kaleidoscope in which we can no longer make out anything" (747). Jealousy is characterized by its limitless- ness: "My jealous curiosity as to what Albertine might have done was unbounded [in- finie ]" (740). In La Jalousie , however, Robbe-Grillet denies his narrator such reflective</page><page sequence="21">A lain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie: Realism and the Ethics of Reading 33 or meditative moments where the thematization of his jealous state could take place. Such resistance to psychologization - again dramatized by the absence of an "I" - sets Robbe-Grillet apart from his influential predecessor. 10. It is ironic that Robbe-Grillet later faults Sartre's work for its use of metaphor ("not an innocent figure of speech") and personification, as well as the narrator's "fatal com- plicity" with the world of things (For a New Novel 53, 62). 11. Robbe-Grillet says of the new novelists' affinities with Foucault: "In part, it is our nov- els that brought about Foucault's reflections on man (and Foucault himself has drawn attention to this). We were almost creating a new philosophy that we ourselves were unaware of, not only as a coherent philosophy, but as any sort of conceptualization of anything" ("Discussion" 128, my translation). 12. This is a perfect example of the ways in which Robbe-Grillet's novel transgresses norms of readability and disrupts ideological complacency. As he says, "La Jalousie is an ordered system of extremely high character, extreme complexity, and extreme inter- est in its opposition to society's view of narrative probability" ("Order" 5). 13. For Blanchot, the reader, a "specialist," "interrogates the work in order to know how it was fashioned. He asks it the secrets and the conditions of its creation, and examines it closely to see whether it answers adequately to these conditions, etc. The reader, hav- ing become the specialist, becomes an author in reverse" (Space of Literature 203). In his "Foreword" to The Novels of Robbe-Grillet, Barthes uses similar language: "The Robbegrilletian novel ... is a thing full of secrets. Therefore criticism must begin to search out what lies behind and around this object: criticism becomes an act of deci- phering, of hermeneutics" (15). 14. While both critics can be described as active because they act as producers of the text, they do not share Barthes 's playful textual approach which celebrates the multiplica- tion of meanings. 15. The English version erroneously translates the French "Le poeme" as "The singing." 16. I would like to thank the anonymous reader for the very useful suggestions.
