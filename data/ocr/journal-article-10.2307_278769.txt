It also adds important data about the little known Late Classic and Early Postclassic occupation. T. PATRICK CULBERT University of Mississippi Oxford, Miss. Achados Arqueologicos num Sambaqui do Baixo Ama- zonas. PETER PAUL HILBERT. Instituto de Antro- pologia e Etnologia do Para, Pub. 10, Belem, 1959. 22 pp., 17 figs., 2 maps. The archaeological sequences along the Amazon river are gradually being delineated, principally by Peter Paul Hilbert, who has devoted his efforts over the past decade to this task under the auspices of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia. The paper under review describes a shell midden on the north side of the Amazon, a few kilometers west of the modern town of Alenquer. Located in a swamp, the site is inundated during the rainy season. The refuse accumulation is composed of rocks and shells. Stone and pottery artifacts and 175 potsherds collected from the surface by Frei Protasio Frikel between the years 1939-41 form the basis of the type descriptions. Pottery artifacts include 26 tubular pipes, the majority with incised dec- oration. The pottery was classified on the basis of temper into three types. The majority (85%) is tempered with sili- ceous sponge spicules, known as cauixi; 5% is tempered with shell, and the remainder of the sherds contains both materials intermixed. Decoration is by brushing, incis- ing or modeling. Motifs used in incised designs include zoned fine crosshatch, zoned parallel lines, unzoned parallel stepped lines, concentric squares, and squared spirals. Vessel shapes are simple bowls and jars with a direct rim. Lug adornos sometimes occur at the rim. Stone artifacts include squared axes with lateral notches, crudely shaped hammerstones, manos, and metates or mortars. The tubular pipes that comprise the most unusual artifacts show the same range and relative frequency of temper varieties as the vessel sherds. Maximum length is 17 cm. Some are plain but others are modeled to produce anthropomorphic forms and decorated with broad lines and fine zoned crosshatch. The only other tubular pipes from the lower Amazon are the much smaller and cruder ones from the later Mangueiras phase, the second pottery-making complex in the sequence on the Island of Maraj6. Hilbert suggests that the two principal kinds of temper represent two archaeological phases, the earlier having shell temper and the later cauixi temper. Most of the decorative styles and the pipes are equated with the later Jauari Phase. There is no clear-cut distinction, how- ever, since examples occur of both pipes and decorated sherds with shell or shell-and-cauixi temper. The major significance of this report is that it docu- ments the existence on the lower Amazon of a site show- ing strong affiliations with the Ananatuba phase, the earliest pottery-making culture on the Island of Maraj6. The zoned fine crosshatch decoration is identical to that characterizing Sipo Incised of the Ananatuba phase. Ves- sel shapes are also similar. Ananatuba phase pottery is tempered with crushed sherd, but cauixi is not native to Maraj6 so that this is not a significant difference. When the affiliations of the complexes on Maraj6 Island were traced, it was suggested that the Ananatuba phase was derived from somewhere up the Amazon. Hilbert's re- port is the first clear evidence in support of this inference. The detailed description and excellent illustrations make it a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Amazon prehistory. BETTY J. MEGGERS Smithsonian Institution Washington, D.C.

These monographs on preceramic sites in southwestern Hokkaido will interest archaeologists concerned with pre- Neolithic cultures in the Far East, and those who look for Asian prototypes or parallels for early assemblages found in northwestern North America. English summaries and captions on illustrations make both monographs useful to those who do not read Japanese. Excellent drawings and photographs of nearly all the implements, detailed tabular summaries of types, and carefully drawn site plans and profiles that record the provenience of artifacts attest to the high standards of workmanship that were followed from the planning of excavations to final publication. These monographs were prepared by teams of specialists from several museums and universities; they represent the combined -and not always compatible--views of a number of leading Jap- anese archaeologists on the very intricate problems of pre-Jomon cultures in Hokkaido. The Tarukishi excavations, carried out in 1954, were the first to demonstrate the presence in Hokkaido of a blade industry at a site for which reasonable antiquity could be claimed. The five authors report separately on their special interests. Shuta Takeuchi describes the preliminary survey, the organization of the team, and the manner in which records were kept, all of which indicate meticulous care in excavation.
