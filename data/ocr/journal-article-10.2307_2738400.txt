<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Circuit Walk of the Eighteenth- Century Landscape Garden and the Pilgrim's Circuitous Progress MAX F. SCHULZ THE FUROR HORTENSIS of the eighteenth century drew its inspi- ration from many fonts: patriotism, economic reward, changes in taste, Horatian ideals of happy retirement, and Miltonic descrip- tions of Eden. Beneath all these justifications for creating private green worlds can be heard allusions to Eden, vestiges of a language once dominant in its appeal to an ultimate authority but now sound- ing like a refrain from another more pious time, which suggests that the paradisal topos often supported the eighteenth-century gar- dening impetus with its ancient, commonly shared nostalgia. Al- though not so noisily and explicitly declared by gardenists as was the new esthetics, the continuing metaphoric vitality of the para- disal topos promised a reality no less pervasively and consciously invoked. In his unpublished poem "The Country Seat" (late 1720s) the Scotsman Sir John Clerk of Penicuik (1676-.1755) exhorted his contemporaries to choose a rural Life in Such a Field As EDEN'S Garden best resemble can Where first th'Almighty Power established Man.'

I</page><page sequence="2">2 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Stephen Switzer, among the earliest of the professional gardeners to urge the new gardening principles, used similarly to stiffen the resolve of his aristocratic clients by assuring them in the same breath as he instructed them about the practical rewards of gardening that their endeavors were mandated by the creator and zealous guardian of Eden: That the unhappy Lapse of our First Parents was the Occasion of that permanent Curse entailed on their Posterity ... and that Paradise itself could no longer maintain its Glory and Splendour, than whilst it was under the immediate Care and Direction of Providence.... It has been therefore the chief and laudable Undertaking of the Wise and Virtuous in all Ages, to endeavor at a Reparation of that Loss, by a studious and laborious Application towards the Redress of those Malignities ... and so to manure, cultivate, dress, and improve. ... 2 This habit of judging the natural world by religious and symbolical frames of reference retained a shared vocabulary dating back to the previous century when the rigor of allegorical thought could still reduce a flower bed or a mountain top to hieroglyphs of paradise. Thus, Pope in "To Bathurst" was able to praise the Man of Ross, John Kyrle's betterment of his patrimony (which he "hung with woods," 253), as a remote analogue of the divine creation, and by implication see his lifelong act of civic and religious piety in a backwater Herefordshire parish as a reenactment of Adam and Eve's in better days and place before the Fall.3 Pope's was only one in a chorus of voices swelling from roughly the 1720s to the 1780s, from Sir John Clerk to Horace Walpole, which found the paradisal analogy irresistible when contemplating the eighteenth-century English garden.4 2Stephen Switzer, Ichnographia Rustica: or, the Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation, 3 vols.

Ronald Paulson has given us a fine discussion of the epistemological implications of the am- bulatory, or pictorial circuit, as he calls it, placing it in the context of the esthetic-psychological interest of the age in multiple per- spectives and in the dissociation of subject and object.' Implicit in the circumambient route of the west garden at Stowe and the inner lake circuit at Stourhead, in addition, however, as also at Woburn Farm, Hagley, The Leasowes, Rousham, Chatsworth (although somewhat camouflaged by the nineteenth-century alterations of Joseph Paxton), and any number of gardens with a lake to circle or an outer belt of trees to follow, is a paradigmatic action which lent itself to a secularized and (if you will) faintly frivolous parody of the soul's circuitous passage in this world from its earthly to heavenly home. It would have been surprising if such an attendant thought had not suggested itself to the sophisticated participants in this ritual tour as they wearily trudged the obligatory round of gardens designed to engage their moral as well as their esthetic faculties. The concentric habit of mind in matters spiritual has enjoyed a long tradition. Mircea Eliade argues that man once regularly par- ticipated in the mythical beginning of things by way of ritual rep- etition and the ideology of the eternal return.

The movement of the soul mapped by such Neoplatonists as Plotinus and Porphyry established a pattern irresistible to subsequent generations of Western religious thinkers. Dante toiling round and round Mount Purgatory in a mi- crocosmic enactment of the Commedia's spiral structure of pos- session, loss, and recovery as he ascends to paradise is only one of the more celebratory medieval variants on this pattern. Similarly, each worshiper could vicariously follow Jesus in his final hours by making a circuit of the stations of the cross situated around the walls of the church. With Western Europe's emergence from me- dieval apprehensions of reality to Renaissance modes of thought, church architecture also, after centuries of Gothic frisson, again began to emulate the human-centered organization of experience implicit, but not always observed, in ritual repetition. The Gothic church reflected spiritual obsessions not intrinsically circular. The forward movement from nave to altar reproduced symbolically the linear eschatology of the world running from Creation to Second Coming. Furthermore, the columns in nave and transept soaring from heavy piers at floor level upward in ever narrowing forms to the thin point of the spire provided a perfect architectural expression of the medieval desire to dematerialize earthly dross in the cele- bration of the etherealized heavenly spirit. The tension between the simultaneous upward and inward thrust of walls and columns, and their contrary gravitational pull downward and outward was struc- turally equivalent to the tension in medieval man between his spir- itual and bodily impulses. The configuration of nave and transept resolved this tension. It reminded the worshiper of what was once Christ's supine and crucified state, and of each person's humble participation in the same Passion and Ascension through his vol- untary renunciation of the joys of the body. The impulse of the Renaissance, moved by Platonic ideals, was to push man to the center of the cosmos. Encompassing in his anatomical parts the whole of the earthly and the heavenly, he was, in effect, a celestial center (to use Eliade's term) in his own right. The centralizing tendency of the baroque church is a reflection of this new, almost excessive, centripetal concentration of human perspective. The dome occupies a dominant central place over a square edifice. Nor does it take much visual imagination to see such a structure as another analogue to the human figure, this one accentuating the glorious ascendency of the head, as indicative of man's intellectual</page><page sequence="5">THE CIRCUIT WALK 5 grasp of religious faith and of his assumption, erect and alive, of the central place in the scheme of things.6 The Pazzi Chapel, by Brunelleschi (?1 377-1446), in Santa Croce (Florence) perfectly embodies the centripetal ideal. It is more than twice as wide as it is long to be exact, two bays and four Corinthian pilasters wider-with the dome dominating the center of the area. The anthropomorphic effect is to emphasize the vibrant uprightness of the human figure. As an architectural unit, the thrust of the chapel inward toward its center is reinforced by several other changes in Gothic idiom. The usual rhythm of a long nave leading to the altar has been reversed in favor of the contrary, a wide shallow room lit by an overhead dome. In effect the rectangle of the nave has been turned ninety degrees, with the front wall articulated by windows, contrary to the usual clerestory fenestration along the sides of the nave. As a consequence light floods in on the worshiper standing in the middle of the room rather than on God and the altar, which here occupies a recess in the back wall, in partial gloom. On the walls Della Robbia medallions of the twelve Apostles and of the four Evangelists add a decorative punctuation to the con- centric man-centeredness of the architectural concept. An interesting consequence of these conflations of human and eschatological mystiques as revealed in church architecture was to suggest that Edenic and fallen earthly abodes occupied overlapping, synchronous positions. Blake was to compile bits and pieces of this visionary man-centered perspective into an extreme description of life as simultaneously a literal and a symbolic enactment of pri- mordial origins. But already before him individuals in his century were finding that it represented no extreme exercise of mind to experience the eighteenth-century landscape garden as a new scene of human bliss, where Eden could be ritualistically renewed, and in that symbolic action the original earthly paradise rediscovered as prelude to the final celestial paradise. As might be expected there was not universal uniformity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on where the earthly and heav- enlv nqrqdises fit into the, salvation of the individiial snil.

More influenced by eighteenth-century secular definitions, although not without the overtones of dissenting "chapel" ethic so pervasive in Bunyan, is Blake's inclusion of the extra baggage of terrestrial experience in the soul's celestial homesteading of earth. For all its fanaticism of theological self-definition, most instructively sugges- tive in its proximity to eighteenth-century England and to the Whig aristocracy identification of their gardens with Eden is the "cir- cumscribed and centripetal world" of John Winthrop (1588-1649) and the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Comparing the maps of Virginia and of New England drawn by Captain John Smith with Winthrop's rough sketch map of his patent, John Seelye pinpoints the shaping idea behind Winthrop's religio-political hopes. In contrast to Smith's expansionist vision of people spreading laterally across America along its waterways, Winthrop's was "a concentric perspective, all the more symbolic for its inaccuracy." The Massachusetts Bay Col- ony nurtured in mind and in fact "a microcosmic demesne ... a concentric geopolitics," which saw itself "at the center of a circle." Furthermore, as Perry Miller has argued, the leaders of the colony planned to return to England with at least a nucleus of the society of saints, after having established their covenantal community in the new world and demonstrated to the old the practicality of its ideal polity.7 That the circle failed to hold and the authority of the colony of saints "drained away along the rivers on which [its] people [scattered and] settled"8 does not question the genuineness of Winthrop's religious perspective, only its efficacy, which sent him and his fellow well-to-do English merchants and professionals on their arduous pilgrimage across the ocean. Little more than a hundred years separate Governor Winthrop's stand in his "Cittie on a Hill" surveying the new Jerusalem sur- rounding him on all four sides from the ambulatory circuit of Stowe-altogether more sociable and geopolitically modest-which nevertheless gave its goodly company of visitors from the 1730s onward an exquisite sense of partaking in the ritual repetition of 7Perry Miller, Errand into the Wilderness (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ.

Apostrophizing equally William Pitt, the bright light of Cobham's "Young Patriots," and "the fair majestic paradise of Stowe," James Thomson added to a later edition of "Autumn" (The Seasons) in 1744-46 his imag- ined delight in treading with Pitt "the enchanted round" of the garden, and sharing in thought "the groves of Attic land" (1041-81). Following the tour described in Gilbert West's poem Stowe, and that set forth in the sequence of Jacques Rigaud's drawings of 1734-35, one departed from the south portico of the house. Sallying forth across parterres past a reflecting pool visitors plodded down a long alley of poplars to the southern extremity of Octagon Lake, then west along the southern edge of Eleven Acre Lake to its head where Kent's Temple of Venus stood. Turning northwest at this point, they trudged past Gibbs's Temple of Diana, with the grassy expanse of Home Park stretching off on their right, until they reached Vanbrugh's pyramid. Here, visitors veered northeast along the northern perimeter of Home Park to the Great Cross Walk of lime trees and an inviting complex of Brick Temple, reflecting pool, and obelisk. From this point one could turn immediately through wilderness to Nelson's Seat at the northern extremity of the gardens; or one could jog southward (as do West and Rigaud)9 in a brief detour to circle the spectacular site of the Rotunda and Queen Caroline's Monument before striking north to Nelson's Seat. From there it was a short return to the north portico, and main entrance, of the house; or, for tourists, an easy access to the approach road along Nelson's Walk, past the Boycott Pavilions, and out of the gardens. At Stourhead one usually began the circuit of the lake at the village end of the gardens, proceeding counterclockwise on the cir- cular path laid down by Richard Colt Hoare between 1792 and 9See Michael Gibbon, "Gilbert West's Walk Through the Gardens in 1731," Stoic, 24 (March 1970), 57-64, for a plan of West's route. As Peter Willis cautions, however, "Although the general route taken by West is clear enough, the details are often vague (for example in his description of the Hermitage and Temple of Venus). Parts of the diagram therefore must be regarded as speculative" (Charles Bridgeman and the English Landscape Garden [London: A. Zwemmer, 1977], p. 117n and remarks to Plate 126). In Plates 129-42 Willis reproduces fourteen of Rigaud's fifteen known drawings (No. 6 is missing from Rigaud's originals) in large finely rendered reproductions; and in Plates 122 to 126 he provides details of the 1739 Sarah Bridgeman General Plan for Stowe with buildings, monuments, walks, and terrain clearly signified, making it easy to identify West's route and Rigaud's perspectives.</page><page sequence="8">8 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 1798 to ensure the proper sequence of sacred associations. "I hear you have been at Stourd. without the dame," Henry Hoare wrote his nephew Richard in January 1755, "so fear you saw undelighted all delight [cf. Paradise Lost, IV, 286-324] tho' you trod the en- chanting paths of paradise."10 Thus did the first creator of this Wiltshire elysium invoke Milton's winsome description of Adam and Eve, ironically as seen through the eyes of the dispossessed Satan, in a letter to the man who would marry his daughter and become the father, losing the wife in the process, of the second great developer of the gardens. Accompanying Richard Hoare on his round of the lake, one passed on the right Henry Flitcroft's Temple of Flora (originally named for Ceres), with its promise of natural abundance, and with its inscription over the portal from Virgil's Aeneid of the Sibyl's warning to baleful presences: "Away, away all you who are unhallowed" ("procul o, procul este, profani," Bk. VI). Directly across the sparkling sheet of water could be seen Flitcroft's imposing Pantheon on a slight rise, toward which the pilgrim progressed circuitously by proceeding northerly along the eastern shore of the lake, festooned with rhododendron, laurels, and yews introduced by Colt Hoare in the early decades of the nine- teenth century, to Six Wells Bottom where several ponds extended northwesterly beyond the northernmost point of the lake; here one turned sharply southwesterly through a plantation of coniferous trees. After having circled roughly half the lake through dense sylvan growth one reached a grotto into which one descended grad- ually, windingly. On the "sacred floor" (Pope, "Verses on a Grotto by the River Thames at Twickenham," 13) of its central chamber solemnly reclined a stone nymph, the air of the place hushed and hallowed. Further along was encountered a statue of the river-god Father Stour, Henry Hoare's witty metamorphosis of Father Tiber, who told Aeneas, "here is your home assured, here your house gods' very place" ("hic tibi certa domus, certi (ne absiste) penates," Aeneid, Bk. VIII). After a steep climb out of the grotto, like Aeneas's toilsome climb following his descent into Hades up rocky steps to the outer world again, one arrived shortly at the Pantheon. From there one crossed a bridge and headed east around the south end of the lake. Beyond, at the southeasternmost end of the garden was revealed high on a hill the imposing dome of Flitcroft's Temple of Apollo (a copy in part of the Roman Temple of Sibyl), sanctuary '?Quoted in Woodbridge, Landscape and Antiquity: Aspects of English Culture at Stourhead 1718 to 1838, p. 30.</page><page sequence="9">THE CIRCUIT WALK 9 of the God to whom Aeneas had appealed for succor on the island of Delos after fleeing sacked Troy, and beneath whose benign sanc- tion the traveler now realized he had been toiling all the time, and to which he must ascend by a steep and hard climb through another grotto. At its base a Palladian stone bridge brought one back to the Temple of Flora and point of origin. Ideally, pilgrims of the circuit would have recognized in the Pantheon a replication of a temple appearing in several Claude paintings, one of which is called Coast View of Delos with Aeneas (National Gallery, London), and would have also noted the link to Aeneas of the Sun Temple. And if they had been attending to these Virgilian associations, to be found in Book VI of Aeneid, they would know they had not only duplicated symbolically Aeneas's journey from Troy by way of Delos sacred to Apollo, his descent into Hades, and his founding of Rome,"1 but had encapsulated in that walk the archetypal patterns of life and death informing Aeneas's journey. One did not have to trudge round the perimeter of such gardens long, progressing from temple to temple, to country house, to imag- ine that one was pursuing vicariously in a two-hour's stroll the pil- grim's way so convincingly parsed by John Bunyan in the last quart- er of the previous century. It is interesting in this regard that when Ronald Paulson walked around Stourhead lake he found himself open to the experience as "an onward moving allegory." Although he reiterates his thesis that "the basic structure of the garden at Stourhead is a pictorial circuit," he allows that several other layers of significance are attendant on "the whole journey." "The basic elements," he proposes, "besides the long journey through the wil- derness, are temples of tillage and harvest [Flora-Ceres], of fame [Pantheon], and of wisdom [Apollo], in that ascending order." The continuing element in all this is "the parallel to the journey of Aeneas," as told in the Aeneid, which "was generally interpreted by the Christian exegetes as a parable of the Christian soul's journey through life, echoed in the Tabula Celetis and other classical texts and in the metaphors of Puritan devotional literature."12 "That all these associations were intended by Henry Hoare, see Woodbridge, Landscape and Antiquity, pp. 30-37; and Edward Malins, English Landscaping and Literature 1660-1840 (New York: Oxford Univ.

Furthermore, such fantasizing ingenuously assumes that a reversal of the Fall can be brought about by the sheer fact of one's activities in a garden. Yet it is within such a context of assumptions that we need to read the response of Gilpin's visitors to Stowe in 1748, as they made their round of the gardens. The controlled prospects bounded by buildings and statues that propose didactic points and suggest moral meanings for the harmonious scenes elicit from Polypthon the grudging ad- mission that he imagines he has been readmitted for a short spell into Eden. As an analogue of his feelings, he uses Satan's words of admiration, "in spite of Envy," for newly created earth:"3 Terrestrial Heav'n ... With what delight could I have walk'd thee round. (PL, IX, 103, 114) Meyer H. Abrams has set forth in his book Natural Supernat- uralism (1971) brilliantly and persuasively the thesis that the Chris- tian paradigm of the circuitous pilgrimage of the soul back to its spiritual home from which it began (as prefigured for example, in the parable of the prodigal's return) is naturalized by the Romantics into a metaphor for their lives and for the times, whereby, among other things, they meaningfully organize their spiritualized appre- hension of nature. One of the most famous examples is Wordsworth's youthful exile from Grasmere and eventual return to that "sweet Vale" (Prel, I, 82), "Paradise/Where I was rear'd" (Prel, VII, 119); but Abrams ranges widely through German Romantic literature and thought in addition to English. In an elaborate exegesis too long and complicated to give in detail, he argues for a Romantic topos that follows the circular design of Paradise given, Paradise lost, Paradise regained (which Morse Peckham succinctly reduces to a Fall-Redemption semiotic pattern). According to the new topos, however, "the apocalyptic predictions of the Bible that the old world will be remade into a new heaven and new earth ... as good as, or even better than, the Paradise he has lost" are secularized by the '3A Dialogue Upon the Gardens at Stow (Los Angeles: William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, Univ. of California, Los Angeles, 1976), The Augustan Reprint Society, No. 176, p. 10.</page><page sequence="11">THE CIRCUIT WALK 11 Romantic writers "by attributing its achievement not to a relief expedition from the sky, but to a potential of power within the human mind and imagination." 14 I wish to suggest that this faith in the prowess of man to make of his world what he will, with all the secularization that this process implies, was as much a legacy from their forebears in the eighteenth century as an innovation in world view which the Romantics be- queathed to us. Admittedly, the generations of Cobham and Hoare kept their pilgrimage to Eden in perspective, as only one part of the design of a reasonable world, whereas the Romantics tended with some zealotry to concentrate their imagination on the earthly paradise as a grand solution. The topos of the pictorial circuit derives part of its significance and emotive value from a Judeo-Christian analogue, whose temporal and spatial design has a diverse parentage reflecting the history of Western intellectual thought: from the Judaic, with its emphasis on the return of prodigal man to the promised land in his lifetime and in this world; from the Neoplatonic, with its configuration of the return of the soul to an ideal enclave after an exiled sojourn in the world of appearances; and from the Christian, with its assimilation of the two traditions through a process of internalization, by the soul's realization in this world of a paradise within, as preparatory for and prelude to realization in the next world of the paradise without. Mircea Eliade characterizes Christianity as a model of human behavior which occupies a position midway between archaic man's organization of his life around the repetition of divine events in order to insure their perpetual regeneration, and modern historical man's freedom to create the world according to his desires and needs.15 Christian history is eschatological, with a divine beginning 14Meyer H.

Angst obviously attends such a loosely defined judgmental system with its indefinitely postponed balance sheet of invested and squandered talents. Nor was it initially reassuring to the eighteenth-century mind to learn that Christianity was heter- odox and itself the product of historical processes, incorporating into its linear conception of history older cyclical directives of daily human activity: for example, the annual celebrations of Christmas and Easter, which coincide with the pagan observances of the winter solstice and vernal equinox. Such conflation of Christian mysteries and pagan mythos does not surprise or upset the twentieth-century mind, indeed the conjunction of sacred rites is reassuring to our historical, ritual-starved sensibilities; but in the eighteenth century, comparative studies in the history of religion, myth, and cultures, which were just getting started, both baffled and offended Christian apologists. A book like Jacob Bryant's A New System; or, an Anal- ysis of Ancient Mythology (1774-76) or like one of Blake's graphic and poetic deployments of the syncretic imagination appeared to be an assault on orthodoxy, and hence a confirmation of the incom- patibility of pagan and Christian symbols and of the atheism, or madness, of the syncretist, as much as an insinuation of the essential oneness of the human endeavor. The difficult task of harmonizing the biblical monotheist revelation and sacred story with other myth- ologies, which was to enlist such subtle intellects as Eichhorn's, Herder's, Coleridge's, and other practitioners of the Higher Criti- cism, was not completed until the end of the nineteenth century.16 In the meantime the eighteenth-century's pioneering venture into historical self-definition left sensitive individuals at best groping for solutions and at worst calling into question the whole sacred nature of mankind's earthly trial. When viewed against this background the speculative Edenic impulse of the eighteenth-century furor hortensis becomes expli- cable. The reaffirmation of a parliamentary form of government at the end of the seventeenth century coincided with the growing ten- dency of the Whig agents of this political change to see themselves 16A fine recent study of this evolution in historical perception is E.

Still, the prevalent habit of mind through those centuries continued to per- ceive human actions as part of a timeless pattern of divine events, whereas in the eighteenth century this satisfactorily ritualistic round of existence began to crumble before the new secular spirit. Pope bears witness to this spirit in his moral satires and epistles on the disrupting establishment of great corporations in the new financial world of the City of London. Civil servant and businessman now bribe and corrupt where cleric and philosopher king once virtuously shrived and honored mankind. The South Sea Bubble, the Walpole administration, sexual promiscuity, political fraud, breached trust, and false stewardship were in his eyes the direct consequences of self-seeking servitude to power in place of the traditional loyalties to man, religion, and country."7 The pain of political give and take without the comforting as- surance of conforming to a divine paradigm can be excruciating, particularly for individuals who are seemingly the first to live in history and to suffer its uncertainties without much precedent for existential living to guide them. A Whig nobleman like Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham (1675-1749), was from all accounts a tough, hard-bitten professional soldier and practical politician. Still, his resignation from the Walpole government in 1733 over a matter of moral principle, and his subsequent political exile, coincides with his increased gardening interests at Stowe. In this regard, Van- brugh's pyramid built in the northwest corner of the gardens in 1724-26, with its inscribed lines celebrating Horatian retirement, was strikingly prescient. The West Garden, completed by the early 1730s, reflects nothing personally unusual to set it apart from other gardens of the time, other than Bridgeman's transitional design which copes brilliantly with a difficult site and with the legacy of unorganized arrangements of predecessors. But the last fifteen years of Cobham's life, coincident with his retirement from government into political opposition, saw a radical evolution of garden design "7Cf.

His concentrated development of the family acres may not have represented a conscious alternative to the painful existential state of being a discarded part of history-in-the-making. The fact, though, is that Cobham thereafter pursued a dual life at Stowe, combining the Roman ideals of civic virtue, personal honor, and rural retirement with the immediate concerns of fame and party politics. Christopher Hussey wittily encapsulates Cobham in these latter years of his career as a man busy cultivating, besides his garden, that dissident faction of Whigs known as the Boy Patriots or Cobham's Cubs, who sided with the Prince of Wales in the squab- bles with the king and prime minister.18 And all these feverish long- and short-term goals are given complex symbolic form in the laying out of the Elysian Fields, where are adroitly sited Kent's temples of Ancient Virtue (copied from the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli) and Modern Virtue (a sham ruin) and his Shrine of British Worthies.'9 Not just the Cobham enclave of Pelhams, Grenvilles, and Lyt- teltons, but the Tory circle linked with Pope (Bathurst, Burlington, and Joseph Spence), as well as an assortment of poets, gentry, and aristocrats Philip Southcote, William Shenstone, Sir John Clerk, second baronet of Penicuik, the Hoare banking family, and Lord Carlisle at Castle Howard all managed to juggle prudent estate management and hard-headed involvement in worldly financial and political affairs with a gardening mania that exulted in the analogue to Adam's and Eve's matitudinal labors of lopping, pruning, prop- ping, and binding the "wanton growth" of nature (PL, IX, 2 10-1 1). Thus were their lives interiorized in harmony at once with mythic and temporal processes. The placid rhythm of eternity implied in the furor hortensis is exalted in the lines in "Castle Howard" (c. 1733) that praise within a Christian frame of reference Lord Car- lisle's labors, even as "Time gently glides away," to improve his lands for his progeny in short, which praise on both ritualistic and "8Christopher Hussey, English Gardens and Landscapes 1700-1750 (London: Country Life, 1967), p. 100.

By thus placing the exorbitant cost of estate development within a noble, and even transcendent, set of referents individuals like Lord Carlisle and Lord Cobham who bridge the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries eased the anxiety of decisions that were otherwise part of the indefinite directionless flow of events. This view of one's place in history of course short-cuts the Christian eschatological purview of the world as running from Creation to the Second Coming, by comfortingly realizing that end symbolically in an historical moment otherwise without cosmogonal significance. The mind that could entertain at once such incompatible ideas lived simultaneously in theological and historical frames of refer- ence. It could see the product of its stewardship literally as a new Eden, while holding firmly onto the common-sensical reservation that the landscaped park was only metaphorically Eden redivivus. Its capacity for political and religious compromise, for maintaining contradictory beliefs in unresolved tension, gave it a high tolerance for living with multipurpose situations. Not Pope and Johnson, and their generations, but Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, and kindred souls sought a transcendent all-purpose explanation for the mystery of life! The circle path around a lake, or outer perimeter of the park, or road within the belt of trees defining the periphery of a landscape garden served many unrelated purposes in eighteenth-century gar- den design. It offered an alternative to the axial lanes associated with formal gardens of an earlier time. In a practical sense it allowed travelers to proceed from the outside road to the house in the least obtrusive way possible; and it afforded the owner the utilitarian means of surveying his works. Southcote justified the circumfer- ential walk around his ferme ornee Woburn Farm thus: All my design at first was to have a garden on the middle high ground and a walk all round my farm, for convenience as well as pleasure: for from the garden I could see what was doing in the grounds, and by the walk could have a pleasing access to either of them where I might be wanted.20 Joseph Spence liked to inform friends that he could "go all round rhisl grounds drv" at Bvfleet Surrev in half an hour on his gravel 20Recorded by Joseph Spence, Observations, I, 424.</page><page sequence="16">16 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES walks.2" As Ronald Paulson has shown, the circuit path also gave the viewer a chance for multiple perspectives with the consequent comparative impressions. And it provided maximum tour of the garden grounds without the irritating necessity of having to reverse one's direction or to double back along one's path. Not least of the efficiencies of this circumferential stroll is that it ended back at the house where the proud owner and his guests could refresh them- selves with a drink after their exercise. Finally, the circular route defined out-of-doors a social and public plan that was echoed indoors by midcentury innovations in the floor plan of both the country and the town house. As Mark Girouard notes, in the formal house of the previous century "the state apartment had normally been strung out along the straight line of the axis of honour," through which individuals seeking audience with baron or king observed a rigid protocol of power and authority as they moved from antichambre to chambre to closet. Beginning about 1750 at Holkham in Norfolk and at Norfolk House in London the arrangement was altered to a circle of interconnecting rooms round a top-lit central staircase, which allowed the flow of guests at an assembly to move sociably and democratically in a circuit from the saloon up the staircase through the reception rooms, state bedroom, dressing room, and closet around to the stairs again, down and out of the house.22 Thus was the social-religious-didactic occasion of the circuit walk of the garden paralleled by the social-political occasion of the circuit tour of the house in an age when parliamentary prerogative had diluted royal rule. Given the ubiquity of the circle path, as well as the repeated encounter along the way of statues, temples, and mausoleums with their moralistic messages, and the happy glimpse of the house (usually available for general inspection by the public upon appli- cation) at the end of the toil across hills and through woods, it would have been extraordinary if the religious associations of the walk had not occurred to visitors. According to Eliade the mythic celebration of "every New Year is a resumption of time from the beginning, that is, a repetition of the cosmogony."23 The growth rhythm of 21Ibid. 22Mark Girouard, Life in the English Country House: A Social and Architec- tural History (New Haven: Yale Univ.

The landscape garden thus fulfills, like the temples scattered about its grounds, the requisites of a celestial center, or axis mundi, and the contemplative walk around it assumes the repetition of a divine act whereby concrete time is projected into mythical time, and profane space into transcendent space.24 The comparative comfort of a morning or afternoon stroll around the garden is parodic of the arduous earthly pilgrimage of a person (as in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales) to a holy church or sacred place and of the spiritual pilgrimage of the soul through the temptations of the mortal world to realize an interiorized "heaven on earth" all analogous ultimately of the prototypical journey of Jesus through this incarnate life back to his heavenly home. Thus did the eighteenth-century Whig, a modern man who had accepted the idea of history and progress, reaffirm, however con- sciously or unwittingly, "the paradise of archetypes and repeti- tion."25 The degree to which Whig aristocrats, county gentry, and common sightseers thought of their garden peregrinations as a para- digmatic journey, and the degree to which they used this divine paradigm in their structuring of their world, is not easy to fix. And it would be foolish to claim that every eighteenth-century garden circuit walk was designed to elicit Edenic sentiments. Many in- tended more modest esthetic and Attic sensations of "earthly hap- piness." William Shenstone's The Leasowes, for example, is apos- trophized in verse invariably in terms of Arcadian enchantment. Robert Dodsley's "Verses ... on his first arrival at the Leasowes, 1754" manages to cite all the "buzz words" of the day for the picturesque rural experience, "enchanted" and "magical" being fa- vorites: "pensive Dryad," "solemn grove," "Tempe's vale," "sylvan god," "new-form'd Arcadia."26 It is remarkable, however, how often 24Ibid., pp. 20-21. 25Ibid. p. 36. 26Robert Dodsley, "A Description of The Leasowes" and "Verses," in The Works in Verse and Prose of William Shenstone, Esq., ed.

The Miltonic legacy, with its nostalgia for Eden, was part of the intellectual furniture of the century, revealed not only in the circular walks of Stowe and Stourhead but also at another level of society in Rasselas (1759) and Tom Jones (1749). The first sums up the ambiguity of happiness: the discontent of the human spirit with its lot and yet its compulsive reiteration of the perfect life. We are told that Rasselas will return to Abyssinia (although it is not likely back to the Happy Valley)27 aware that happiness is neither permanent nor to be taken for granted, still moved nevertheless by the need to seek a life of fulfillment that he knows is unobtainable. Ending on a less disillusioned note, Tom Jones, that exponent of eighteenth- century English values, inscribes in his paradigmatic expulsion from home and eventual return to Squire Western's family seat and mar- riage to Sophia an upbeat version of the configuration confirming human confidence that the original rightness of things can be reas- serted however east of Eden the exile; and if Tom has not explicitly found paradise he certainly has reached a place contiguous to it- Squire Allworthy's Paradise Hall where he grew up as a boy. Corollary to the nostalgia for Eden was a penchant, refined almost to singularity, of searching out God's moral plan in the disposition of nature as Richard Jago insists upon in Edge-Hill (1767): "shall we ... with moral eye,/The scene review" (p. 121) which lent itself to collective participation on an afternoon's progress through the park in one of western man's most compulsive acts since at least Mosaic times: the trek to Mecca, return to the promised land, pil- grimage to a holy place, call it what you will, whose combination of pious and social ambiences Chaucer so joyfully celebrates. Are not Gilpin's two indefatigable pilgrims, Callophilus and Polypthon, participants in effect in just such an age-old ritual during their journey to and tour of the varied scenes of Stowe? complete even to seeing their peregrination, particularly their departure, as an analogue, Old Testamentary via Milton, of the original drama en- acted in Eden! The practice of organizing the eighteenth-century garden as a circuit tour of a rural paradise is already well defined early in the century, as indicated by West's poem Stowe and Rigaud's drawings 27Cf. George Sherburn, "Rasselas Returns-to What?" PQ, 38 (1959), 383-84.</page><page sequence="19">THE CIRCUIT WALK 19 of Stowe. How deeply rooted was this habit of mind is illustrated by its persistence into the second half of the century in a poem like Goldsmith's "The Deserted Village" (1770), which elevates an at- tack on the contemporary rage for extensive landscaping in the new style, particularly when dwellings and hamlets are removed in the selfish interests of private pleasure, into a nostalgic keen for the passing of English village life. As John Dixon Hunt observes, "the fashion in which Goldsmith revisits the remembered village scenes is exactly the progress around and through a landscape garden."28 Goldsmith's taxonomy of the ideal components of an English village, if not absolutely demonstrable as circuitous, is certainly circum- stantially so, for there is evidence that the old village of Nuneham Courtenay may have supplied Goldsmith with details. It was generally assumed by readers in the eighteenth and nine- teenth centuries that the characters of the parson, blacksmith, schoolmaster, and soldier derive from Goldsmith's memories of his father's Irish village, Lissoy; and that the shameful practice of evictions referred to in a general way have their origin in the same memories. In our century evidence has slowly accumulated to in- dicate that Goldsmith with equal insistence was alluding in the depopulation and abandonment of "Sweet Auburn" to the English villages, especially from the 1760s onward, being rolled under in the interests of enclosure or of estate improvement. More than one of the eighteenth-century "sons of Claude" (so William Mason termed them in his poem The English Garden [1772], III, 323) rooted out or relocated a cottage or whole paradisal vista. Cobham had not hesitated to remove a road and mill, and to immure a church in trees all that was left of the medieval village of Stowe which had disappeared during the Civil War when they interfered with his development of the East Garden of Stowe; and Hoare neatly incorporated the village of Stourhead into one of his garden's pic- turesque perspectives. That Goldsmith observed such activities at first hand is verified by his essay "The Revolution in Low Life," first printed in Lloyd's Evening Post for 14-16 June 1762. In this essay, which Ronald Crane considered to be "a first sketch of The Deserted Village," the central issue is the dispossession of the in- habitants of a village by a "Merchant of immense fortune ... who had lately purchased the estate ["distant about fifty miles from 28Hunt, The Figure in the Landscape, p. 242.</page><page sequence="20">20 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES town" (p. 116)] on which they lived, [and who] intended to lay the whole out in a seat of pleasure for himself" (p. 118).29 Recently, it has been argued that the only village in England in the 1760s sit- uated about fifty miles from London which fits the description in this essay was Nuneham Courtenay, an Oxfordshire village trans- lated to a new site one and a half miles away by the first earl Harcourt approximately from 1761 to 1764 to improve the view from his new house. And a case is made for identifying the rector of that doomed village, the Reverend James Newton, an ardent gardener, with the preacher in "The Deserted Village" (see lines 137-40); and an elderly widow Babs Wyatt with the "wretched matron ... sad historian of the pensive plain" who was left behind when the rest of the villagers were moved (see lines 125-36).3? A 1707 estate map shows that the old village, like so many of its sisters and brethren, had been laid out in typical medieval fashion, with the substantial homesteads clustered around a large triangular green, and the rest of the cottages scattered in a second larger circle along the four roads branching off from the green on a wooded bluff above the Thames River quite unlike the neat linearity of the new village whose cottages face each other "as regular and as uniform as a London street."3' There is no record of Goldsmith having visited Nuneham Courtenay. We know, however, that he was in the habit of taking jaunts into the country, and as the 1761 "Revolution in Low Life" bears witness, his "solitary rounds" of one such reland- scaped village site must have contributed to his conceptualization 29Ronald Crane, New Essays by Oliver Goldsmith (New York: Greenwood Press, 1968, 1927), p. xl. The essay is reprinted on pp. 116-24. Much of the same ground is covered by Arthur Friedman in his introduction to "The Deserted Village," Collected Works of Oliver Goldsmith (Oxford: Clarendon, 1966), IV, 273-77. 30Mavis Batey, "Oliver Goldsmith: An Indictment of Landscape Gardening," Furor Hortensis: Essays on the History of the English Landscape Garden in Memory of H.

Whether Nune- ham Courtenay was Auburn is finally less important than our rec- ognition that the model Goldsmith is drawing on for his deserted village adheres to a cluster, rather than a linear, single-street con- figuration. In this regard it is worth noting that Lissoy, where Gold- smith spent his boyhood, preserved this circular contiguity; it is described by a contemporary in 1790 as containing "in a circuit of not more than half a mile diameter ... every striking object" men- tioned in the poem.32 A brief guided tour of Auburn, following the poet-narrator's rem- iniscent round of village haunts, but keying it to the contours and landmarks of Nuneham Courtenay, quickly confirms that Gold- smith's locus classicus was circular. His litany of a bygone idyllic time begins presumably in common fields that were north of the village and less than a mile from the main London-Oxford road; proceeds up the hill where cows grazed, milkmaids laughed, and schoolchildren sang and shouted; along a now "grass-grown foot- way" (127) skirting the northern edge of the village to a copse at the southwesternmost end "where once the garden smil'd" and near- by "The village preacher's modest mansion rose" (137-40);33 then east and north to the village green, past a "straggling fence" behind which "The village master taught his little school" (193-96), and the public house "where nut-brown draughts inspir'd" (221)-so wends the poetic narrator in mental circuit of "lovely bowers of innocence and ease" (5). That "The Deserted Village" resonates with more than sociocul- tural nostalgia-that inherent in Goldsmith's estimation of late eigh- teenth-century rural England is a Christian Edenic mythos-is in- dicated by the last line quoted. Embedded in its reference is a matrix of Christian otherworldly expectations that the poem never 32Letter of the Rev. Mr. Handcock, quoted in James Prior, The Life of Oliver Goldsmith, M. G., 2 vols.

Press, 1972). 33The old rectory (along with the manor house), was situated west of the village, but was pulled down in the early 1760s to make way for the first Lord Harcourt's pleasure-grounds and an unobstructed view toward Oxford from the new villa begun in 1756. In 1761 a new rectory was built farther north (but still on the west side of the village) on high ground facing the river. Its mansion-like "elegance" was commented on by more than one contemporary. In the 1 790s the actress Mrs. Siddons rented it for several summers (cf. A History of ... Oxford, V, 237).</page><page sequence="22">22 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES adequately articulates, although the impulse to do so is there. When the narrator comments early in the poem, I still had hopes, my long vexations past, Here to return-and die at home at last (97-98), he alludes to more than a simple homecoming. In his return to his native village to die, after a lifetime of "wanderings round this world of care" (85), he is also realizing his heavenly home, for the village is mythically a repetition of original paradise. This ultimate earthly destination is semantically residual in the diction and emergent in full ironic force when read against the backdrop of eighteenth-cen- tury garden symbolism and within the eschatological frame of the circuitous pilgrimage of the soul. The irony lies in the narrator's failure to recognize the full range and exact gamut of his pessimism. He is more old-fashioned in his elegy for village life than the poem acknowledges, since he is bidding farewell at its deepest level of statement to the paradigmatic round of paradisal village life. If Goldsmith had been fully conscious of the symbolic resonances of his poetic references, he would have understood that "the park's extended bounds" (277) not only doomed the village but translated its self-contained cycle of customs and pastimes into a diffused form unconducive to paradigmatic repetition. For the change in per- spective, in the instance of Nuneham Courtenay, caused by exten- sion of the prospect visible from the house with removal of the village, reflected a change in perception taking place in the 1760s and 1770s.34 This shift in visual vocabulary was being explored as early as the 1730s and 1740s at Claremont, Chiswick, and Rousham especially, and above all at Stowe where much of the east gardens and specifically the Elysian Fields had been laid out by William Kent, and the Grecian Valley by Capability Brown. Lancelot "Ca- pability" Brown (1716-83) left his position as head gardener at Stowe about 1750 to strike out on his own. He quickly established himself as the dominant landscape architect in England in the sec- ond half of the century, designing landscapes with broad reaches of park whose undirected visual experiences inevitably diluted the 34For an excellent discussion of the early eighteenth-century landscape garden and its didactic associative designs on the visitor vs. the late eighteenth-century Brownian landscape and its latitude for free association, see Clark's pioneering study of this subject "Eighteenth-Century Elysiums," 165-89; and Hunt, The Figure in the Landscape. For a summary of the characteristics of the Brown landscape, see Dorothy Stroud, Capability Brown (London: Country Life, 1950).</page><page sequence="23">THE CIRCUIT WALK 23 radial route's ritual language of repetition. Whether he was re- sponsible for the change in visual expectations, or was an expression of it, is not certain; but his parks tended to eliminate the guided circular walk in favor of impromptu detours and unprescribed wan- derings across the hills and dales. Brown was to come to Nuneham Courtenay at the request of the second earl Harcourt in 1778 to develop its visual vocabulary; and the resultant grounds were even- tually celebrated by the poet William Whitehead under the title "The Late Improvements" (1787). An added irony lies in Goldsmith's contamination of "The De- serted Village" with the historical view of man that he is ostensibly condemning in his objection to the new landscape. The poem is hesitant to commit itself unreservedly to the symbolic recitation that is its professed frame of reference. Instead it digresses into economic and social denunciation of the wealthy, in short, assumes the historical perspective of the object of its criticism. "The De- serted Village" is an early instance of the gathering gloom felt more on the pulse than articulated in the mind that was to envelop the nineteenth century in a darkening night of disappointment and low- ered expectations. In a sense the eulogist of the deserted village is more pessimistic than the elegist who had sung his epitaph some twenty-five years earlier in the country churchyard. Goldsmith's poem laments not just the end of a village, and a time-honored way of life, but unintentionally also the cessation of a way of thinking, an archetypal habit of mind increasingly unfashionable to the au- tonomous, historically oriented mind, and by extension the end of a paradigmatic way back to Eden. It is no wonder that the poem's rhetorical structure and point of view is indeterminate, at once an exercise in political persuasion, a public utterance of classical dis- position with a dramatis persona; and a personal cri de coeur, a landscape of memory with internalized topography.35 In effect, "The Deserted Village" straddles multiple means of coming to terms with experience: the first is hallowed by rhetorical practice it is reluctant to give up, and the second articulated by subjective needs it is timid 35For a summary of the conflicting critical interpretations of the poem's rhetorical strategies (specifically Ricardo Quintana's, Richard Eversole's, Leo F.

Goldsmith would have been easier of mind in the nineteenth century with its acceptance of expressive modes of state- ment, or better yet in our century, which recognizes that no one form of discourse is inevitable or necessary.36 The non-Brownian landscape garden was ordinarily a circumfer- enced Eden, its vistas and perspectives terminating with temples, rotundas, mausoleums, and architectural and sculptural reminders of divine virtues and human follies. It contained a complete and ordered world comprehended by the associative turns of mind of its participants alike in the symbolic actions of the circular walk and in the allegorical encounters along the way. The Brownian gar- den restrained the circumambulatory habit to a subsidiary part of the total landscape: a lake walk or a pleasure course around trees tucked away on one side of a river or in a pleasure garden. Elsewhere the panorama of lawn and fields sweeps unobstructed to the horizon, with the implication that the same scene continues beyond the belt of trees and the immediate ring of hills. Not only is the point of view unprescribed but the perspective is visually incomplete. In the seventeenth century the divine cosmos was presumed to be reflected in the geometrically laid out lanes and mathematically correct axials of its formal gardens. In the eighteenth century the well-marked radial walk around the haunts of a landscaped paradise was valued by latter-day Adams and Eves in knee breeches and afternoon gowns in part for its moral and archetypal allusions. The ultimate Brownian enthusiast evolved into the Wordsworthian Romantic, who inter- rupted the prescribed route to cut across fields in spontaneous ex- ploration of meadows and dells which were valued for their own intrinsic holiness. To put it another way, the landscape garden evolves from a closed to an open ideal vista, the hortus conclusus steadily extended until it consists of the whole goodly universe. This view of earth as a symbolic open form leaves its Edenic identification scarcely distinguishable from the actual countryside. 36Some anthropologists and linguists have argued that a binary organization of experience-for example, the structuring of language and the ordering of space on the analogy of up-down, front-back, night-day, left-right-is at least as intrinsic to human perception as is that of ritual repetition.

This period and its landscape garden may have been the last instance when the modern mind could still enter unselfconsciously into the repetitive patterns of thought and action of archaic man. By the end of the century, despite the Promethean efforts of the Romantics to invest the prim- itive earth with symbolic import, the new historical orientation was rapidly pushing human perceptions toward more empirical modes of apprehending experience.
