<plain_text><page sequence="1">ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE: FORM, FUNCTION AND MEANING. Edinburgh, Edin- burgh University Press. Paperback edition, 2000. 664 pp., 24 colour plates, 302 black-and-white photographs, 1244 line drawings The first edition of this amazing survey of Islamic architecture has been in the academic bloodstream for three years, and this paperback edition is almost as long. If one adds to the details noted above that those 664 pages are double-columned one can only be impressed with the scope of the undertaking. Also one should understand that the pith of the laudatio and the range of the negative impressions need not be repeated in this critique which chooses not to dispute the structure and the intent of the work but rather to 'shore up images' as possible points of reference for future editions. It is only proper, too, to note annoyances felt by the reviewer at certain locutions in the text. If one reads a chapter at a sitting, the term 'stereotomy' seems reasonable, but to have it repeated in every chapter (sometimes twice) is to risk monotony, which is a pity, for the diction commanded by the author is, to say the least, awesome. The same 274</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS: LANGUAGE AND CULTURE stricture applies to 'pars pro toto' and 'catchment'. If 'none' be construed as 'not one' then no matter how many words intervene the phrase must be 'none ... is' vice 'none ... are' (initially on p. 54). To refer constantly to a riwdq type of mosque as 'hypostyle' is misleading when the instance at hand is clearly arcaded, no matter how many past and present scholars employed the term. Thus only those buildings whose roofs rest directly on columns or pillars can be termed hypostyle, e.g. those Anatolian mosques whose roofs are supported by wooden columns (p. 92). Finally it is almost tediously incorrect to refer to polychrome glass patterns within a stucco matrix as 'stained glass' for the European expression of the latter had and has a linear design painted on the glass surface within a much thinner lead matrix (pp. 59, 206, 320, etc.). Earlier criticism has deplored the poor quality of some of the black-and-white plates which are repeated in this paperback edition without visible improvement. However, it should be understood that about a third have not been published before which puts us in debt to Professor Hillenbrand though, alas!, there is no concomitant list of the sources of these photographs. Thus in p. 100 it is eye-achingly difficult to detect the bridge which connects the minaret of Ibn Tulun to his mosque. What puts us even more in debt to him are the remarkable three-dimensional drawings. While these are not exactly laid out (it is rather difficult at times to connect them with the ground plans in the composite catalogue of line drawings at the back) they are of inestimable help to the reader in visualising the entirety of the monument from its remnants. Still, a more acute monitoring might have caught the fact that two of the four rites in the mosque-madrasa of Sultan Hasan (4.65 on p. 195) lack their light and air shafts, or that the Emir Han in Bursa (6.98 on p. 353) has no visible entrance whereas the one to the Bey Han also in Brusa (6.110 on p. 352) has a most beautifully articulated one. And such monitoring might have saved us the gaffe attendant to the Kapi Aghasi madrasa in Amasya (p. 215): the three-dimensional drawing shows an intrance with a triangular pediment/pishtdq while the photograph shows it to be rectangular! The fact that the drawing (4.150 on p. 234) gives the Madar-i Shah madrasa in Isfahan a square courtyard implies that the monitor was over-worked that day. Professor Hillenbrand gives short shrift to those earlier scholars who opted for a chronological approach to the subject. On Creswell and the Alexandria Pharos: His narrowly chronological approach is superficially attractive because of its methodological rigour. (p. 167) But such an approach permits the student/reader to accrete the past examples when facing the next and thereby get a distinct feel for the whole at the end of the digestive process. With Professor Hillenbrand's different process the aforesaid student/reader gets mixed up in the hurly-burly of space and time being asked to consider simultaneously monuments on the Oxus, the Nile and the Ebro. Also it would be of tremendous help if he were not digitally handicapped. (The List of Captions for Line Drawings on pp. xi-xxvi; the Composite Catalogue of Line Drawings on pp. 465-597; and the List of Cross-references for Line Drawings [added in the paperback edition] on pp. 650-664!) That Islam was intelligently accommodating to local building practices and traditions is eloquently manifest by the array of minarets on pp. 130-131, but the only thing they seem to have in common is verticality, their variety being simply too bewildering to attempt unifying theories. And why include examples from West Africa and India (p. 142 and pp. 158-161) when these areas have been excluded in the introductory chapter? Along this same line of intention, why exclude the buildings of the Sultanate period of India but include the buildings of Anatolia for the comparable period? And if you mean to exclude India why reproduce the representation of its examples from Percy Brown's pioneer work on Indian Muslim Architecture (3.72-3.89)? Without diminishing the scale of his work or the adroitness of his argumentation one may take exception to some of Professor Hillenbrand's deeply held, at times most circuitously arrived at, convictions. Your reviewer does not believe that the builders of the earliest monuments in Islam were moved to 'exploit symbolism' (p. 14). Von 275</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS: LANGUAGE AND CULTURE Grunebaum threw Islamic society on the procrustean bed of Classicism and found it wanting, hence not really a civilization; indeed it lacked the civic institutions which guarantee a civilization. It picked and experimented and chose, but then inevitably transmuted what it chose. One cannot take for granted that the evolution of the Arabic mosque module was motivated by public processional considerations; indeed the final solution of the Great Mosque of Damascus is a matter of solving the dimensions of the temenos rather than a decided appeal to symbolism. Nor can one can believe that his overwhelmingly Sunni subjects prostrated themselves (other than at Azhar) when the Fatimid Caliph's name was invoked. Nor do we believe that early Islam displayed in its architecture 'a penchant for illusionism and ambiguity' (p. 25). If we did we would agree that as a result of this penchant Islamic architecture and decoration 'are therefore permanently at war' (same page), and we do not agree, for a harmony exists between these factors in practically all of the very great early Islamic buildings on an arc between Seville and Samarqand. Iranian stucco on Iranian brick structures is a splendid achievement which was never really eclipsed by the advent of tiling. And the evolution of decoration within the squinch remains an Iranian achievement of no mean order. And there really cannot be any such 'warfare' when inscriptions are included in the discussion; indeed to a scholar such as Erica Dodd they provide a sacral quality to any mosque they adorn. That this type of decoration achieves harmony without any inclusion of the zoomorphic or the anthropomorphic might be pondered further by the author; otherwise his statements run the risk of being considered merely aesthetic mumbling. (Of course one agrees that Andalusian decoration goes from the plangent to the plastically over-developed in a very short time; but who would deny the unearthly beauty of those muqarnas domes in the Alhambra?) Perhaps, unwittingly, we are in the throes of architectural decoration on brick buildings as opposed to those made primarily of stone. The latter need not have decoration applied as did those of brick after the early experiments with decoration of baked brick itself (e.g. the Tomb of the Samanids in Bukhara or any of the Iranian minarets up to ca. 1300 when end-brick tiling became manifest) had been exhausted. This line of discussion would have become more manifest had the building of Sultanate India not been excluded while it is achingly obvious in any Mamluk building or minaret, per se. (On this latter point the minarets of al-Ghuri and Qani Beg are not 'playful' [p. 171], they are visually idiosyncratic when compared to the minarets of the Qa'it Bey period, hence perverse.) On the otherwise admirable discussion of the madrasa we find some of the author's judgements almost prejudicial: e.g. the four-rite form introduced into Cairo ca. 1245 is 'freakish' (p. 188) whereas the prototype Mustansiriya in Baghdad (ca. 1233) is a 'triumph of technique', mathematical as well as architectonic. The form had become necessary in Cairo as it had replaced Baghdad by 1260 and therefore had to serve all four rites. This was obvious by the time Malik al-Nasir finished the madrasa of his brother al-Ashraf Khalil where all the madhhabs are included (p. 195). And why are the Ayyubids made the early patrons of the small-is-beautiful theory of construction (p. 190)? Give any one of them the resources of Egypt and one finds something like big-is-usual in operation: e.g. the Citadel, the Mausolem of al-Shafi'i as well as the two-rite madrasa of al-Kamil and the four-rite madrasa of al-Salih. Nor does pointing out that the madrasas of Tatar al-Higaziya and Ylgay al-Yusufi are not 'Circassion' (p. 199) and that there is little point in emphasizing the Mas'udiya madrasah in Diyarbakr is the prototype of the four-rite module (p. 215) when the plan (4.98) does not indicate the specific iwans for the specific rites deny the rigour of Professor Hillenbrand's explication of the problem. As in no other single volume on Islamic architecture are we as much indebted to the author as we are to Robert Hillenbrand for his analytical and utilitarian approach to the 276</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS: LANGUAGE AND CULTURE subjects of the mausoleum and the caravanserai. Only he has shown us the indubitable uniqueness of the Khan Mirjan in Baghdad (pp. 360-365), indeed we believe he has 'rescued' it for our acute attention. The composition of the external part of the transverse vaulting and consequent fenestration is without equal in the dar al-Islam; the compo- sition at once recalls the vaulting of some of the Umayyad desert structures and the solutions offered in some twentieth century concrete buildings. To the highly original survey of the Islamic palace we would add that a marvellous sirdab (actually a set of two rooms and a latrine) was discovered in Fustat in 1972 and dated to the eighth century (p. 382). But it is difficult to substantiate the author's animadversion on the palace at Kirk-Kiz (p. 409) when neither photographs nor drawings attend the argument. It is also trying to find that whereas we cover the full panoply of Iranian and Anatolia mausolea, when it comes to the equally majestic panoply of Mamluk mausolea in Egypt and Syria we are told 'A few key monuments will therefore have to do duty for the entire sequence'! Such obvious partiality should have been made manifest in the introduction; otherwise we are left with the impression that the author holds the former superior (aesthetically?) to the latter. To reiterate our purpose: these notes and observations are meant to serve future editions of this remarkable volume. In the scholarly world before the thrust of CD-ROM and the digital revolution, we would aver that if wide-scale destruction of those shored-up images were at hand then this is the one book we would save for its wealth of illustrative materials, the courage of its concept (no footnotes!), the grand sweep of its coverage, the clarity of its presentation, the explicatory power demonstrated in the introductions to its six institutional structures, the lilt of its style and variety of its overall diction and the superb, untiring enthusiasm animating the whole. Despite the dubieties and preferential slants of opinion, Robert Hillenbrand's amazing survey is a force to be reckoned with, a force which will grow ever stronger as this century sees it as a sterling statement of the last century's coming-of-age, an age when digital dexterity might, just might, become otiose.
