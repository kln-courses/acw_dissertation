<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism. By Jon Hoover. Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science: Texts and Studies, 73. Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2007. Pp. 276 + xii. 104.00. Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) is a thinker who merits serious research if only for his hugely authoritative and inspirational role in present day Sunn! trends such as Salafism, Wahhabism, and Islamism in general. Moreover, he is increasingly revealed to be a figure who combines an unexpected intellectual sophistication with the religious radicalism for which he is better known. Thus Jon Hoover's highly lucid and informative study of the theodicean writings of Ibn Taymiyya confirms, amongst other things, the surprising impact of Ibn Sfna on him, despite his emphatic opposition to much of the Avicennan philosophical heritage of his seventh/thirteenth-century milieu. Hoover contributes in this to the same trend as seen in the research of Yahya Michot, and the acknowledgements indeed begin with credit to Michot for his helpful criticisms of the text in its earlier form. The form in question was Hoover's 2002 PhD thesis, and the book reflects these origins in its clear style and commendably meticulous structure, with each of its six chapters building to their own subsidiary conclusions, and the whole book culminating in an overarching conclusion. Orientated by the secondary literature to date on the subject, Hoover has tracked down and compared Ibn Taymiyya's theodicy texts strewn throughout his formidable corpus, in the process discovering valuable new material. Ibn Taymiyya's provocative views and idiosyncratic combination of influences make for fascinating reading. He seems to defy easy classification in the spectrum of contemporary schools, and a lasting impression of Hoover's study is that its subject had a bewildering facility for synthesising standpoints and exploding antinomies. Notably, free will is combined with determinism, and Hanbali revelationism is fused with Avicennan rationalism in a manner which prompts the reader to focus on whether Ibn Taymiyya's teaching sustains genuine intellectual coherence or is instead in the end a brilliant - doubtless very serious - rhetorical game. The first chapter is largely concerned with Ibn Taymiyya's 'theological jurisprudence'. This unearths what turns out to be the deepest level of the Hanbali thinker's ethics and wider epistemology, namely divine law. He roots his ethics in theology, which he in turn roots in an epistemologically deeper authority, revealed legislation. His theology thus concerns what it is legal to say about God (hence the phrase 'theological jurisprudence'). In this way, Ibn Taymiyya's ethics turn out to be ultimately circumscribed by the Qur'an, the epistemological foundation for all else (p. 25).</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 89 This radically revelationist trend is of course vulnerable to Muctazili arguments that our assent to certain judgements - ethical or otherwise - is required before instruction through revelation and religious tradition (al-ictiqad qabla wurud al-samc). The Muctazills insist that there must be a starting point in reason, on which basis revelation is itself assented to, since, logically, we cannot accept revelation simply because it itself asserts that we must. In ethical terms this contention entails deontology, the teaching that certain ethical judgements are intrinsically or rationally knowable, and do not require God to inform us about them through scripture. For example, telling untruths is known independently to be basically wrong. It may thereby be inferred that God's word itself would not simply be a lie. Yet in this we collide with the unusual bent of Ibn Taymiyya's discourse, which resists neat labels. For, though he stresses the Qur'an's primacy, in fundamental ways his ethics are precisely aligned with this very deontology and ethical objectivism of Muctazilism. He deems ethical principles to be innate or fitri, such that 'the natural constitution ... dictates what is good for humans to do and love' (p. 42), and in our thinker's lexicon, natural constitution (fitra) is often employed for reason or intellect (caql) (p. 39). So we confusingly discover that Ibn Taymiyya's ethics are here very much in step with Muctazili principles, a trend in his thought which has been noted by numerous commentators. The resolution to these particular contradictions lies in the following. Ibn Taymiyya's massive work Dar9 ta carud al- caql wa 1-naql is formulated overall as a refutation of the principle that reason must be privileged over revealed tradition in instances of conflict. (Incidentally, the fact that as major a Sunni thinker as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi espoused and defended this principle surely exposes the opposition of European 'reason' and Muslim 'unreason' for the historical travesty that it is.) We learn from Hoover - building on work by Abrahamov and Michot - that the shaykh rejected the said principle because reason and revelation were instead taken by him to be in unconditional agreement. The grounds for this a priori unanimity were that 'reason ... has no status apart from revelation' (p. 30). There is thus no Averroist 'double truth' theory here, no mere question of complementarity or mutuality: '... for Ibn Taymiyya the Qur'an and the Sunna are the summit and peak where the two paths of reason and tradition come together' (p. 30). In other words, the Qur'an in this teaching is virtually coterminous with reason. It is reason par excellence. So, despite its notional separation, reason's operation is rather strictly confined by revelation in this epistemological teaching. It is in this light that we must decipher Ibn Taymiyya's seemingly high regard for reason, and any ostensive rationalism to be found in his ethics. A similar pattern emerges as we pass through the variety of issues linked to Ibn Taymiyya's theodicy, Hoover's focus. This pattern involves the ingenious</page><page sequence="3">90 Journal of Qur'anic Studies appropriation of MuctazilT (also Avicennan) terms and ideas to the climate of Hanbalism. The presence of these ideas in this milieu, however, impels Ibn Taymiyya to utterly reconfigure their meanings, and it is questionable whether the ideas survive this reconfiguration substantially, or only nominally. An intriguing example of this is his handling of the decisive issue of whether God is motivated by concern for the promotion of creaturely benefit and welfare (maslaha). Firstly, Ibn Taymiyya clearly embraces this idea in relation to God's legislative activity, and thus 'asserts that God's command is directed toward the wise purpose (hikma) and mercy of promoting human benefit' (p. 37). Later, in a vital discussion (p. 72 ff.) which builds on Joseph Bell's findings in his Love Theory in Later Hanbali Islam,1 we learn that Ibn Taymiyya also teaches this in relation to God's creative activity in general, i.e. that '[God] acts to the profit and benefit of His servants' (p. 74). The term he employs here for the loving teleology of God's acts is (as in the quotation above) hikma ('wisdom'), though he also sometimes frankly glosses this with the more provocative gharad ('motive' or 'purpose', p. 74). Ashcarism disapproved of positing such explanatory purposes in its own theology, because they implied needs in God, factors extraneous to Him which determined His activity. The concept was, however, a leitmotif of Muctazilism. Yet in accepting this major Muctazili doctrine, Ibn Taymiyya changes it beyond recognition. The issue is surely fundamental. Ibn Taymiyya's teaching on maslaha is deeply linked to his being classed with those thinkers who held that the very world that exists is in fact the best (aslah). This is the shaykh's 'optimism' referred to in the title of Hoover's study. The view in question was captured in the famous Ghazalian dictum: laysa fil-imkan abdac mimma kan (literally, 'there is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is'). What then is distinctive in Ibn Taymiyya's optimist ('best of all possible worlds') theodicy? In many such theodicies there was a trend (some would argue, morally obtuse and the kind of philosophical anaesthesia savagely satirised in Voltaire's Candide) simply to deny reality to evil. And, sure enough, in exegetical works like his Hasana and his commentary on the Fatiha we find that Ibn Taymiyya does engage in this type of relativisation, ultimately negating any ontological status for evil and rooting it in pure non-existence (cadam, pp. 14-15, p. 195). We also find our thinker diverting from God the responsibility for the evil aspect of creation on the basis of Avicennan distinctions like universality and particularity. For he ventures that evil is remote from God, and at the level of particulars (p. 179, p. 181); but this seems somewhat contrived, given that elsewhere the Hanbali authority emphasises the all-encompassing nature of divine agency, as I will shortly mention. Perhaps, then, the most characteristic and interesting element in his approach to the issue of the fundamentally beneficial, indeed optimal, nature of creation lies in another direction. According to him, God creates all - even evil things - with a wisdom which is ultimately inscrutable. In this, Ibn Taymiyya remains a definite teleologist in</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 91 how he thinks about God's activity, but a frankly agnostic type of teleologist. While he offers provisional rationales for God to send people adversity (to expiate their demerit, perhaps, and to increase their reward through giving scope for patience in trials) it is in this agnosticism that we seem to touch the deepest intuition of his theodicy. In his Su?ila can abyatfi'l-jabr he confesses human ignorance, for the most part, of the details of God's wise purpose (p. 191). According to the Qur'an (Q. 2:30), even the angels fall short of understanding His purpose in creating Adam and his violent race. With an unfathomable prescience, God 'created evil to be an inevitable constituent of humanity ... human beings would not be human had God created them differently and God's wise purpose would not have been realized. Yet, not even the angels, much less humans, know why this is so' (p. 192). Though for Ibn Taymiyya the exact 'how' of God's purpose is beyond understanding, its axiomatic wisdom contextualises evil within an ultimate goodness. He thus enjoins that, from a higher viewpoint, evils - of whatever degree - are not really evil. As an example of this stance, Hoover quotes the following from the Minhdj as typical: 'If God - Exalted is He - is Creator of everything, He creates good (khayr) and evil (sharr) on account of the wise purpose that He has in that by virtue of which His act is good (hasan) and perfect (mutqin)' (p. 181). To underscore his reasoning Ibn Taymiyya extends his optimism here to a list of self-evidently negative data: 'God is Creator of illnesses, aches, hateful odors, ugly forms and noxious bodies like snakes and human excrement on account of a profound wise purpose in them' (p. 181). This removal of divine teloi from human understanding or evaluation is in fact explained by an important detail of Ibn Taymiyya's thinking which Hoover has brought out earlier (building on Bell again). Namely, the true ends or purposes of God's creative activity lie within Him, not external to Him: 'God is indeed moved by purposes, but purposes that are His own' (p. 76) and 'for Ibn Taymiyya, the cause [i.e. the purpose] is not disjoined [= munfasil] from God' (p. 78). We might even say that God's purposes are identical with Him, for at root the whole teleology of creation comes down to God's reflexive love, and His self-praise. As Hoover puts it, 'the world is an accidental and secondary - even if necessary - product of God's self-love' (p. 232). This Neoplatonic and Sufi element in Ibn Taymiyya's theodicy is clearly a beautiful answer to the Ashcari challenge mentioned above - that to speak of God's activity in terms of any kind of 'purpose' is to blasphemously introduce a determinant for it external to God, implying deficiency (pp. 74-5). Yet it is equally clear that such a 'good' which motivates God's acts lies far beyond the human sphere. Not only does it transcend human understanding, it is not even directly related to human welfare. Ibn Taymiyya's radically transcendental, or mutatis mutandis, agnostic, view of the wise motives of creation is profound, and, some would argue, is the only viable theodicy, humanly and morally. It is not without a strong modern resonance insofar as</page><page sequence="5">92 Journal of Qur'anic Studies it combines belief in God with an acknowledgement that, from the human viewpoint, the relation of particular evils to God's omni-benevolence is intractably mysterious, and should be left so. That said, one must still ask: what has happened to the concept of welfare with which we started? The term, but hardly its semantics, survives Ibn Taymiyya's handling. What in practice differentiates this 'welfare' (maslaha) from the 'justice' (cadl) of God maintained in classical Ashcarism even when quite divorced from human criteria? For, in his Lumac, al-Ashcari in the chapter on imputing justice and injustice to God, 'al-Tacdil wa'l-tajwir\ states that God might even inflict pain on infants in the afterlife, give an infinite punishment for a finite sin, or damn believers and save unbelievers - but in doing that He would still be 'just' ('Wllahi tacala dhalika wa-huwa cadil in facalahu').2 Al-Ashcari's specific reasoning, of course, is that injustice is a violation of moral bounds, and since God sets all such bounds, He Himself can under no circumstances be 'unjust'. Though Ibn Taymiyya's deontology and ethical objectivism sets him apart from this in the formal dynamics of his thinking, both his and al-Ashcari's approach disquietingly distance and even divorce the divine from human sensibilities. The comparison seems the more worrying given that Hoover's study opens by actually excluding Ashcarism from the purview of 'theodicy' as a framework of inquiry: '...a major current within the [Islamic] tradition - the voluntarism of Ashcari Kalam theology - rejects the question of theodicy as meaningless. God's unfettered will, sufficiency apart from the world, and exclusive power preclude asking why God does this or that' (p. 1). Yet as we see, al-Ashcari does formally maintain a theodicean discourse by affirming that God is just (cadil), however removed His justice might be from human conceptions. Ibn Taymiyya's philosophy of action, discussed in Chapter Four ('God's Creation of Acts in the Human Agent'), involves a reconfiguring of concepts similar to these above cases. He seems opposed to a necessitarian discourse of 'compulsion' (jabr), and holds that 'belief in the human will is vital for belief in command and prohibition, promise and threat' (p. 147). In other words, without choice, there is no moral accountability. Hoover states (citing texts in the Minhdj, Wdsitiyya, Irada, Jabr and Abu Dharr) that, according to Ibn Taymiyya, 'from the human perspective, humans are the agents of their acts in reality (haqlqatan) - not metaphorically as Jahm b. Safwan would have it - by virtue of what God has created to subsist in them. Humans act by their will, power and free choice (ikhtiydr), and judgements for their acts are attributed to them and not to God' (pp. 154-5). In like vein, Ibn Taymiyya throws out the Ashcari teaching that God might give humans obligations they are incapable of fulfilling (taklif ma la yutaq) - in view of the all-comprehending nature of God's power and agency in Ashcari thought. Though God determines even the sinner's acts, the sinner remains answerable for them and legally obligated. Ibn Taymiyya rejects</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 93 this (p. 167 ff) and Hoover states that for him 'human disobedience occurs for lack of human will, not for lack of power (p. 169). All this seems unequivocal, but many details in Hoover's discussion serve to qualify it. Though our thinker does affirm the reality of human will in acting, he however denies that that will is produced by the human agent. He thus effectively negates the very basis of his libertarianism in the same breath as he establishes it. The decisive will (al-irada al-jdzima) through which the act occurs is directly produced by God at the time of the act itself. It is part of the total power which brings about the act, a power which is supplied by God (p. 150), albeit that there is a power of soundness (musahhih), i.e. non-impairment, possessed by the human before and during the act, which is a precondition of the act (p. 148). In all this, Ibn Taymiyya clearly retreats from the Muctazili notion of God's wholesale empowerment (tafwid) of human agents. On the contrary, in his approach 'there is no essential difference between voluntary and involuntary human acts from the perspective of God's creation' (p. 147). A crucial Qur'anic text for understanding Ibn Taymiyya's position, and one he often quotes, is to whomsoever among you wills to go straight: You will not unless God, the Lord of the worlds, so wills (Q. 81:28-9). Ibn Taymiyya adopts an argument from preponderance (rujhdn), probably from al-Razi, directed against the Muctazili belief that, in acting, human agents exercise a real choice over both the act and its contrary. The Muctazili claim is self-defeating, as opting for one of the alternatives requires a preponderator (murajjih). To avoid an infinite regress of motivating factors, a single preponderator which necessitates the act must be affirmed, namely, God. Ibn Taymiyya uses this 'extensively in Minhd] to counter the Muctazilism of al-Hilli' (p. 146). Hoover dubs the shaykh's position a kind of 'compatibilism', a subtle 'third way' (between determinism and freedom) indebted to Ibn Sina. This position made use of a paradox (in fact dating from the antique Greek philosophical heritage) in a bid to combine the terms of the antinomy: the human individual is compelled (mudtarrl majbur) in the form of one who chooses freely (fi sura mukhtaf) (p. 139, p. 143). In Ibn Taymiyya's words: 'God made (ja?ald) the servant someone who freely chooses what he does ... God is his Creator and the Creator of his choice' (p. 174). Exactly how this is to be interpreted is open to question, but the fact that Ashcari figures like al-Ghazall and al-Razi took up such a formula surely points the way. Indeed al-Razi embraces the term 'compulsion' (jabr) as an accurate and positive description of his causal theory. It is, in other words, a solution which only combines the terms of the antinomy by relegating freedom to the surface level of conventions and appearances, underlying which is a deeper deterministic reality. At any rate, that this reading of Ibn Taymiyya's compatibilism is along the right lines seems to be confirmed by Hoover's proposed model for it, namely instrumentality.</page><page sequence="7">94 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Human agents are 'purely instrumental from God's perspective' (p. 160). Thus, in commenting on Q. 9:14 ... God wdl chastise them by your hands, Ibn Taymiyya explains that 'our hands are the secondary causes, the instruments (alat), the intermediaries (awsat), and the tools (adawat) in bringing the chastisement to them' (pp. 160-1). It is arguable that this form of compatibilism is only formally distinct from determinism or jabariyya. Despite what we are given to believe, we are, at root, simply a mechanism for divine activity. There is in human acts a purely dependent power and will which God's power and will in reality underlie. It is hard indeed to see where our culpability - a fundamental theme of the Qur'an - enters this picture. Moreover, the question arises over such actions: why does not God Himself just do them? That is, since God is the perfect cause, it becomes incomprehensible that He introduces a purely instrumental kind of human agency into His causation. Surely, if God introduces human agency into the created order, it must be for a real significance in that agency, and is incomprehensible if the agency is stripped of functional independence of any sort. Ibn Taymiyya's response to this would doubtless involve his agnostic optimism. For, as Hoover expresses this concept of causality, 'God's perspective appears to be that of a real but inert world of tools and raw materials that is wholly dependent upon God's will for its every movement. God creates by means of these instruments in accord with His wise purpose' (p. 164). But, in defence of libertarian (i.e. Qadari) forms of theism, it could also be asked: is it not a curtailment of God's power, and in fact a blasphemous negation of divine omnipotence, to say that God can under no circumstances empower any other being, even if He willed to empower it? A final example of Ibn Taymiyya's trend of thought from this study is his approach to the divine attributes, and in particular that of God's 'will'. Firstly, it is noteworthy that Hoover indicates that 'interpretation' (taJwil) in Ibn Taymiyya's vocabulary is not a negative term. He only rejects it in its sense of substituting new, reason-based meanings for Qur'anic descriptions of God. Ibn Taymiyya embraces tajwll as a positive term in the sense of the linguistic or lexicographical interpretations of the pious forebears (salaf) and in the exalted sense of the true semantic content of Qur'anic descriptions, as known to God Himself (p. 54). Ibn Taymiyya's stance on the divine attributes is indeed removed from a crude, uninterpreted anthropomorphism. It is described by Hoover as 'agnostic realism' (p. 56), that is to say, he affirms the reality of the attributes without in any way reducing them or rendering them figuratively; but he simultaneously insists on their transcendence of human reference or comprehension. As Hoover puts it, 'Ibn Taymiyya understands God's names and attributes neither literally nor metaphorically' (p. 52). The beauty of his approach is that it keeps to the exterior of the Qur'an while also maintaining divine transcendence. But it should be noted that the methodology is essentially identical to that of Ashcarism, namely, the de-anthropomorphic affirmation of divine attributes (al-ithbdt</page><page sequence="8">Book Reviews 95 bi-ghayr al-tashbih) - a link-up seemingly not pointed out by Hoover. Moreover, other aspects of Ibn Taymiyya's teaching replace this purely agnostic mode of affirming God's attributes with an analogical mode of affirmation. It is intriguing that Ibn Taymiyya supports analogy in law and criticises schools of thought, such as Zahirism, which reject it (p. 57) - again indicating the difference between his reality and his reputation. But it is even the case that he accepts a form of analogical reasoning in theology, though only in this strict form, namely, qiyds al-awld, or a fortiori analogy. In this approach, 'God is worthier (awla) of whatever judgement of perfection is applied to creatures than are the creatures themselves' (p. 58). Through this extension of analogy to God, Ibn Taymiyya does open the door to some kind of comparison (tamthil), which he indeed traces to the Prophet's authority. For the Prophet, notably, explains how all believers will see God in a unique, one-to-one vision, even though they are a collectivity. He states that the likeness (mithl) of this vision is 'this moon [which] each of you see alone'. In such a manner, says Ibn Taymiyya, '[the Prophet] assimilated (shabbaha) the one vision to the other vision, even if the one thing seen is not similar (mushdbih) to the other thing seen' (pp. 55-6). Perhaps it was in this same spirit of assimilation to the dissimilar, or comparison with the incomparable, that Ibn Taymiyya allegedly proposed (according to Ibn Battuta) that God's descent to the lowest heaven in the last part of each night (as mentioned in the well known hadith) was like his own motion down from the pulpit (ka-nuzuli hadha). Though this famous anecdote is not mentioned by Hoover, he does mention that God's mysterious multi-directionality (both 'ahead' and 'above') is dealt with by Ibn Taymiyya through comparison with the sky and celestial objects (p. 55) and that God's being located beyond the sky was apparently taken by him at face value, as known by the 'natural constitution' (p. 40, n. 93). However, the most interesting and relevant example of tashbih is that of God's will. Ibn Taymiyya's concept of divine will typically emerges from his critical analysis of both philosophical and Kalam views. On the one hand, he argues that the eternal, complete cause posited in philosophy cannot explain the emergence of non-eternal events of the kind we see all about us. 'He maintains', says Hoover, 'that it is incongruous for any [temporal] events whatsoever to originate from an eternal, complete cause, whether directly or indirectly' (p. 82). On the other hand, Ibn Taymiyya also asserts the incoherence of the Kalam theologians' idea of the creation ex nihilo of a non-eternal universe from the eternal will of the Creator. He maintains that 'God cannot change from the impossibility of acting to the possibility of acting without a preponderator' (p. 84). He does not accept al-Ghazali's impressive argument in the Tahafut that God might eternally will something non-eternal, i.e. that it could be in accordance with God's eternal will that He designates the moment at which the</page><page sequence="9">96 Journal of Qur'anic Studies world is to enter existence. Thus, according to al-GhazalT, the world may begin at a particular time and God's will may yet be eternal and unchanging. Our theologian flatly rejects this, insisting that a preponderator for God's will would indeed have to be introduced, to take it from an uncreative to a creative state (pp. 84-5). The upshot of Ibn Taymiyya's rejection of both the philosophical and the Kalam teachings is both daring and curious. Against the philosophical doctrine of God as the complete eternal cause of a single eternal simplex, the first effect, Ibn Taymiyya declares that the minutiae of the world, in all their complexity and multiplicity, are directly God's effect. In practice this requires the Hanbali shaykh to re-think God's causality as something piecemeal and unfolding, in tandem with the piecemeal and unfolding nature of things within the created order. As Hoover puts this, 'what is eternal cannot be an object of God's will ... Ibn Taymiyya believes that it is totally unnecessary to posit an eternal divine will because everything other than God ... is originated. Originating events may be accounted for adequately with successive willings' (p. 85). Next, against the Kalam doctrine of a temporally incepted world and in view of the preponderator problem just mentioned, Ibn Taymiyya declares that the world is indeed without beginning: 'God has been willing and acting from eternity' (p. 87). Though particular things within creation are originated, God's creative activity as such is not: '... He has been acting from eternity by His will one thing after another [sic]9 (p. 81, quoting Ibn Taymiyya in Minhdj 1:146). Or, as it is expressed in Hoover's conclusion: 'Each individual created thing is preceded by non-existence in time. Yet, there have always been created things, and the genus or species of created things is eternal' (p. 232, also see pp. 88 ff). This then is the explanation of the word 'perpetual' in the title of Hoover's book, Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism. It is certainly noteworthy - astonishing even - that this prototypical scriptural fundamentalist in Islam should be unmasked as accepting the eternity of creation, and thus to depart from a literal reading of the Qur'anic account on so primary an issue. That said, one fascinating consequence of this departure is that Ibn Taymiyya must overturn Kalam arguments, with roots reaching back to John Philoponus, that show the absurdity of an infinite series of past events. Such a series is perfectly possible, argues Ibn Taymiyya with typical intellectual audacity. One such argument which he attacks claims that it is inconceivable to add to an infinite series, which would then become greater than the same series prior to the addition. This produces the absurdity of one infinite series being in excess of another. But if the world has no beginning, today's infinite series of past moments is in excess of yesterday's. Therefore, there is after all a finite series of past moments and the world indeed has an absolute beginning. Against such arguments, and in favour of a pre-eternal world, Ibn Taymiyya simply engages in a thought experiment in which he takes over the uncontested assumption that the future is unending. He then extends this future series</page><page sequence="10">Book Reviews 97 of moments by starting it earlier and earlier in the past. In Hoover's words: 'from the Flood to future infinity is greater than from the Hijra to future infinity' (p. 82). Next the shaykh simply flips the reasoning over and applies it to the past: 'likewise, what is between the Hijra and past infinity is greater than what is between the Flood and past infinity even though both lack a beginning'. Needless to say, all this has a provocatively modern ring to it. Ibn Taymiyya's thinking is in step with Cantor's trans-finite mathematics, integral to which is the viability of infinites of different sizes - at least in the realm of numbers. But, to return to Ibn Taymiyya's concept of God's will: in this teaching, to repeat, God's will operates through time, which is without beginning. The divine will through which unfold the events which constitute the universe, is itself unfolding and ever-changing. It is thus, in a sense, a superlative version of human will - very much in line with the aforementioned method of a fortiori analogy. Hoover indeed states about the reasoning behind this distinctive concept of the divine will, 'the Creator has a greater right to perfections found in creatures than do the creatures themselves [and] to be exonerated of imperfections from which they exonerate themselves ... one who performs successive acts is better than one who has something conjoined to him from eternity' (p. 87). It is hard to interpret this as other than an anthropomorphising trend in Ibn Taymiyya's understanding of God's will. It is remote from the supra-temporal, ever changeless divine will axiomatic for most Muslim theologians and philosophers. Instead it is a will subject to both change and time, a geometrically expanded analogue of our own will. In sum, the refreshingly unimitative, but also contradictory, nature of Ibn Taymiyya's thought emerges from the issues constellated around his theodicy, central to which is a theory of perpetual optimism. The 'optimism' in this phrase of Hoover's refers to a 'best of all possible worlds' theodicy, that is, the doctrine that God's activity is deeply motivated by benefit or welfare (maslaha). Yet God's 'wise purpose' retreats from human inquiry, in what is ultimately an agnostic approach to the teleology of God's acts. Next, the qualification of the optimism as 'perpetual' turns out to refer to a model of creation as eternal - most surprising for a figure famously associated with attacking the philosophical heritage. A thinker deft at upending expectations emerges from all the major issues dealt with by Hoover. Ibn Taymiyya's apparent rationalism and ethical objectivism end in a stress on the primacy of the Qur'an. The discourse accommodating free will, via 'compatibilism', ends in a purely instrumental concept of human acts, which from a deeper viewpoint have God as their agent. Finally, a transcendental and agnostic theory on God's attributes, via a fortiori analogy, gives way to disconcertingly anthropomorphic ways of thinking about God. Hoover notes that at present the precise chronology of Ibn Taymiyya's works remains unresolved (p. 15). Yet to hope to remove these tensions and contradictions simply by</page><page sequence="11">98 Journal of Qur'anic Studies attributing them to shifts in his views in the course of his career perhaps misses the profoundly antinomic trend of his thought, albeit that this quality, far from being celebrated, is denied by Ibn Taymiyya himself, who routinely insists on the consistency and rationality of his positions. As Hoover puts this feature in discussing the particular antinomy that our acts are those of 'free' human beings, yet are wholly created by God: 'Ibn Taymiyya resists the drift toward open admission of contradiction ... and refuses to surrender claim to rationality in the face of this most intransigent of theological paradoxes' (p. 145). Any resulting incoherence has nothing to do with Hoover's admirably clear and systematic analysis of the shaykh's teachings in this study, but is surely intrinsic to the teachings themselves.
