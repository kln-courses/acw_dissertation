<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY VOLUME XCI, NO. 1, NOVEMBER 1994 PARMENIDES' COMPLETE REJECTION OF TIME P armenides is often credited with discovering the category of timeless truths, and he is sometimes praised or blamed (along with Plato) for asserting that what is real can transcend time.1 But besides positing a timeless reality for eternal truths to be about, Parmenides finds fault with beliefs about time and argues that time is not real: if temporal thoughts are inherently contradictory then reality cannot be temporal. In claiming time to be contradictory, Parmenides stands first in a line of philosophers (including Plato, Kant, andJ.M. McTaggart) who find something unreal about time. Today, it is easy to ignore Parmenides' rejection of time. There may be timeless truths, and those of logic and mathematics are still enchanting, but they are rarely so compelling to tempt people to deny the irrepressible flux of their experience, especially perceptual experience. It is obvious time is real. So, if Parmenides forces a choice between atemporal, rational posits and temporal experience, many will conclude so much the worse for analytic metaphysics. In the spirit of Henri Bergson and Martin Heidegger, time is real and, if knowable, known in some intuitive way. For others, the response need not be so contentious: Is not today's logic sufficiently sophisti- cated to provide simple diagnoses of what must have been Par- menides' faulty reasoning? Did he not just fail to appreciate the logic of tenses? Or was he not merely trafficking in semantic misdi- rection when he worried so much about "nothing," that is, when he denied all attempts to think "what is not is"? ' See, for example, G.E.L.

Mourelatos, ed., The Pre-Socratics (Garden City: Anchor/Doubleday, 1974), pp. 271-92. 0022-362X/94/9111/573-598 ? 1994 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc. 573</page><page sequence="2">574 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY In this paper, I shall suggest it is wrong to interpret Parmenides' position as hinging mainly on semantic issues centered on reference. I shall show how commentators who do so fail to do justice to his complaints about time. Instead, I shall reconstruct Parmenides' wor- ries in terms of the recent conflict between "tensed" and "tenseless" views of time. From this perspective, Parmenides offers an early pro- scription on the contradictory beliefs that dog any metaphysics based on temporal becoming. It will also become clear how complete Parmenides' rejection of time was: why, for other reasons, he could not accept even the tenseless view, and why he should be suspicious of attempts to read him as discovering a new kind of "eternity." I Parmenides is often introduced as an uncompromising rationalist, someone willing to abandon common sense to champion an a priori insight. According to F.M. Cornford,2 whereas "Heraclitus is the prophet of a Logos which could only be expressed in seeming con- tradictions, Parmenides is the prophet of a logic which will tolerate no semblance of contradiction" (ibid., p. 29). People tend to believe what they perceive, however, and what they believe they perceive are things changing in time. Parmenides' final judgment is harsh: mor- tals are "dazed, undiscriminating hordes." Carried along by experi- ence, they believe "that to be and not to be are the same and not the same." Wandering "two-headed," the path taken by them is "back- ward-turning."3 Although Parmenides does not mention him by name, it is common to read such remarks as warning against Heraclitus' identification of opposites and against his exaltation, in contradictory epigrams, of the backward-turning cycles of fire and war. And it is common to see Parmenides as empowering pure, logi- cal thinking as able to overrule the testimony of perception. Beliefs shaped by perception are alleged to be faulty because they are con- tradictory, and what is wrong with contradictions, to use Parmenides' path metaphor, is that they are "backward turning." If one asserts and denies the same thing, one does not get anywhere. Contra- dictions try to affirm and deny, so they really do neither. It is Parmenides' strategy to root out basic contradictions in common beliefs, thereby revealing the true character of reality. If, for exam- ple, he can expose as contradictory all beliefs that treat what is real as changing or as temporal, then he can conclude reality is neither 2 Plato and Parmenides (New York: Roudedge, 1939). 3From fragment 6 as given by G.S.

So far, this sketch of Parmenides may be clear and relatively uncontroversial. What is not clear, and should be controversial, is exactly why Parmenides thinks time is contradic- tory. Parmenides4 (in the voice of a guiding goddess) asserts there are, ostensibly, two basic approaches to reality: The one, that it is and that it is impossible for it not to be, is the path of Persuasion (for she attends on Truth). The other, that it is not, and that it must necessarily not be, that I declare to you is a wholly indis- cernible track; for thou couldst not know what is not-that is impossi- ble-nor declare it, for it is the same thing that can be thought and can be (ibid., pp. 13-4). Scholars still debate the meaning of this passage, but, at a simple level, Parmenides indicates two apparent paths and says the first one must be taken because the second one turns out to be "indis- cernible" and "impossible." But then the goddess indicates what might seem to be a third path, one that involves a failure to appreci- ate the difference between the first two. It is this latter dead end that is the confused, wandering way of the dazed and undiscriminat- ing: [I also hold you back from the way] on which mortals wander knowing nothing, two-headed; for helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts, and they are carried along, deaf and blind at once, dazed, undiscriminating hordes, who believe that to be and not to be are the same and not the same; and the path taken by them all is backward- turning (KRS 247). It is clear Parmenides believes only the first path should be fol- lowed-it is the only path that really leads anywhere. It is not so clear, however, what it is, exactly, that makes the alternatives impossi- ble. That is, there is disagreement about what is responsible for their alleged contradictory character. Some confusion stems initially from the ambiguity of 'it' in the indication of the paths "it is" and "it is not." At the start, it is safe to assume 'it' refers to whatever it is that is real. By the end of Parmenides' brief work, he has explicitly affirmed that reality is an undifferentiated unity. So it is reasonable to conclude, by the end of the journey, that 'it' refers to such a sin- gle entity (sometimes named being or the One). It is unwise, however, 'Fragments 2 and 3 as translated by W.K.C. Guthrie in A History of Greek Philosaphy, Volume II (New York: Cambridge, 1965).</page><page sequence="4">576 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to assume 'it' functions as a pronoun for some superentity, being, from the very beginning. Such an assumption tempts one to try to read Parmenides backward: if 'it' names being, the phrase 'what is not' (in fragment 2) must purport to refer to something else-call it nothing. Then, since the path "it is not" is rejected because it is an example of trying to think "what is not," Parmenides must be reject- ing the path "it is not" because he thinks it is the same as attempting to think "nothing is." It is at this point that commentators are too often content to focus their analytical and diagnostic skills on the issue: What is problematic about "nothing is"? Now, it may be true Parmenides would agree that nothing and the void (where these are taken to be pseudo entities ostensibly named by 'nothing' and 'void') could be examples of what some mortals might believe "what is not" to be, but it should not be assumed Parmenides' talk of "what is not" is, right from the start, an attempt to proscribe such problematic reference. It should not be assumed that Parmenides is, right from the start, equating "What is not" with dubious reference to nothing. He wants to argue, for example, that temporal becoming is impossible. In so doing, he presents genesis and ceasing to be as examples of what is not. But it is far from clear that they are objectionable (or that Parmenides thinks they are objectionable) in exactly the same way ostensible thoughts of nothing might be. Unfortunately, commentators who assume, right from the start, that 'it' names being and 'what is not' names nothing (or nonbeing) are too often content with facile interpretations of Parmenides' denial of "it is not," interpretations that are of little or no help in understanding his denial of the reality of time. Here is a quick sample of stereotypical diagnoses. According to F. Copleston,5 Parmenides' point is that "nothing cannot be the object of speech or thought, for to speak about nothing is not to speak, and to think about nothing is the same as not thinking at all" (ibid., pp. 66ff.). On Bertrand Russell's6 interpretation, Parmenides' prohibi- tion against thinking "it is not" is linked to the denial of change as follows: When you think, you think of something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something. Therefore both thought and language require objects outside themselves... [so] whatever can be thought of or spoken of must exist at all times (ibid., p. 49). 5A History of Philosophy, Volume I (Garden City: Image Books, 1962). "A History of Westen Philosophy (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945).</page><page sequence="5">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 577 Compare Russell's remarks to some of Heidegger's,7 ones that might serve as a caricature of traditional logic-based philosophy's concep- tion of its roots in Parmenides: He who speaks of nothing does not know what he is doing. In speaking of nothing he makes it into something...He contradicts himself. But discourse that contradicts itself offends against the fundamental rule of discourse (logos), against "logic" (ibid., p.19). Such quick equating of "it is not" with attempts to assert 'nothing is' run the risk of trivializing Parmenides' position by making it appear as if his reasoning rests on some kind of semantic gimmick. Thus Copleston complains that, when Parmenides denies one can think "it is not" (that is, in Copleston's reading, think of nothing), he is just committing a simple fallacy of equivocation: he is not recogniz- ing (or, he is assuming one will not recognize) the difference between thinking of nothing in the sense of having a thought that negates the existence of things and thinking of nothing in the sense of not exercising one's cognitive faculties at all. Clearly, one cannot think of nothing in both senses at the same time. There is no rea- son, however, for thinking this trivial confusion is the basis of Parmenides' warning against trying to think what is not. More to the purpose here, there is no reason for thinking such equivocation con- tributes to what is objectionable in thinking reality to be temporal. Manifestly, in thinking of things as past or future or as becoming, one is exercising one's cognitive faculties and ostensibly thinking of something. What is needed is an interpretation that shows why having temporal beliefs commits one to thinking "what is not" in some plau- sibly controversial way. Russell does not do much better. According to him, Parmenides is initially agitated by a semantic puzzle: whatever is thought of must be named, so one cannot think of nothing without naming it, there- by turning it into something and failing to do what one set out to do. This suggests Parmenides is just trying to help one avoid the kind of 'An Introduction to Metaphysics, Ralph Manheim, trans. (Garden City: Doubleday, 1961). Heidegger, as part of a larger project, wants to talk about nothing in his own way. In this regard, Parmenides is to be admired not because he uses logic to banish what is not, but rather because he is one of the first to realize "that along the way of being the way of nonbeing must be specially considered, that it is there- fore a misunderstanding of the question of being to turn one's back on nothing with the assurance that nothing obviously is not" (p. 94). When it comes to the "path of nonbeing," however, Heidegger is sanguine: "to be sure it cannot be trav- eled." And it suffices to point to his phenomenological orientation parenthetical- ly: "(For that nothing is not an essent does not prevent it from belonging to being in its own way)" (p. 94).</page><page sequence="6">578 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY mistake made by the Red King in Lewis Carroll's8 story: if nobody passed the messenger on the road, then somebody (namely, nobody) should have arrived first. Supposedly, then, you are urged not to try to think of nothing (what is not) because to do so you would have to turn it into something. But if this is all there is to Parmenides' worry, then it looks as if he gives a semantic trick some legitimacy. Either he is made to look silly (like the Red King) for not seeing it is just a trick, or he is made to look superficial for trying to base rationalist metaphysics on a gimmick. Such semantic inter- pretations do not clarify, nor do justice to, Parmenides' objections to time and change. Thus, Russell goes on to read Parmenides as believing that whatev- er can be thought about (or named) must exist at all times, because it might be thought about at any time. If everything named obtained all the time, temporality would be undermined because all "times" would be the same time (by the identity of indiscernibles). With no change, there would be no time. This line of thought is congenial to advocates of relational theories of time (like Russell), and early philosophers did link time and change. But there is no reason to suppose Parmenides believed reference is to what exists at all times just because he supposed successful reference requires the present existence of the referent. Nor does his rejection of time fol- low from his denial of change (plus the identity of indiscernibles). Rather, it will be suggested below, his denial of change hinges, in part, on his rejection of time: change is impossible, in part, because temporal becoming is impossible.9 If Parmenides' rejection of time involves forswearing all temporal concepts (and it does), he would reject the premise that what is thought about (or named) must exist at all (present) times. And surely he was aware that people typically believe they can talk and think about past or future things without thinking they presently exist. Rather than reject such thinking by implausibly assuming all successful reference is to what presently exists, Parmenides can be read as charging that temporal thinking fails because it is contradic- 'Through the Looking Glass, in The Annotated Alice, M. Gardner, ed. (Cleveland: World Publishing, 1963). 'Owen also makes the identity of indiscernibles too important and makes Parmenides look as if he assumes what is does not change: if what is is unchanging, then "nothing can be said of it in the past or future tense" (op. cit., p. 273). Complaining the argument is incomplete, he supplements it with the identity of indiscernibles. Although Owen sees this as anachronistic and recognizes "the familiar readiness of the Greeks to picture the lapse of time as the parent and reg- ulator and assessor of change," he does not explore the likelihood that Parmenides' rejection of time is logically prior to his denial of change.</page><page sequence="7">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 579 tory: time is not real because temporal becoming requires one to affirm that what is ostensibly real both is and is not. If this case can be made, the kind of semantic thesis Russell suggests as a premise may be closer to being a Parmenidean conclusion.'0 II Suppose 'it' in Parmenides' 'it is' initially refers to whatever exists or obtains, whatever it turns out to be or to be like. (Like a detective arriving at the scene of a crime might say, "whoever did this is a real criminal.") Then, Parmenides' starting point can be taken to be the tautology, "whatever exists, exists." As W.KC. Guthrie points out (op. cit., pp. 14-6; cf. KRS 245ff.), it is not cogent to complain that Parmenides begins with a tautology if he is trying to show how peo- ple unwittingly contradict it. And being contradictory is what marks the wrong path as wrong right from its start: "that it [namely, what is] is not...is a wholly indiscernible track." Only after marking this contradiction as indiscernible does Parmenides say the same thing that can be thought can be. Philosophers from Plato to Russell and Heidegger may have been tempted to read this short equation linking thought and being as epigrammatic semantics: Must every real thought have a real (pres- ent) referent? But if, in decrying the indiscernibility of "it [what is] is not," Parmenides is emphasizing the self-defeating character of contradictions, then the test for the genuineness of thought is just its noncontradictory character. It is at least a necessary condition for true thought that it be noncontradictory. Today, it is implausible to think it is also a sufficient condition, since it is a commonplace that many otherwise consistent sentences can nevertheless fail of refer- ence or be false. It should be remembered, though, that Parmenides concluded nearly all mortal beliefs involve contradic- tions, and he found the set of genuine thoughts to be astonishingly small. Although he may have been unclear about the character and '"Philosophers who are quick to find Red King semantics as the key to Parmenides risk an understandable, and perhaps old, anachronism. There is no doubt that problems of meaning and reference have been fertile in the history of philosophy, and Parmenides probably influenced this history by prompting Plato's "semantic" aversion to "nonbeing." But Plato had other concerns, and his reasons for avoiding positing a Form for nonbeing should not be assumed to be the same as Parmenides' aversion to affirming what is not. True, Parmenides says "it is the same thing that can be thought and can be"(fragment 3) and he remarks "nothing is not" there for being or thought (fragment 6). But his reason for denying thoughts of "what is not" may be both simpler and, in the case of time, more provocative than either making or wanting to avoid the Red ling's mistake. And even if Parmenides had semantic concerns, surely there is no reason to think he was constrained by Russell's epistemic requirement that meaning and reference be anchored in the present data of acquaintance!</page><page sequence="8">580 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ontological weight of genuine thoughts, and although he may have been wrong about the extent of contradictions, this should not detract from his desire to unmask impostors. Contradictions fail to be genuine thoughts not so much because they are semantic failures but rather because they are syntactic fail- ures. As such, they fit Parmenides' path metaphors better than semantic concern with naming. To attempt a thought like, "whatev- er exists (or obtains) does not exist (or obtain)," is akin to stepping in some direction and stepping back. Such a "path" fails to take one anywhere. Parmenides can warn against contradictions without committing himself to either a theory of cognition or a theory of meaning. He can do so without articulating a formal principle .of noncontradiction. All he need do (and all he does) is exhibit a basic contradiction (like "what is is not"), remarking such a path cannot be taken. Accordingly, a minimal interpretation of Parmenides' admonition against trying to think what is not will not portray him as committed, from the beginning, to any prejudice against naming the void, for example, nor will it allege any semantic aversion to a term like 'noth- ing'. "Nothing exists" is not objectionable because it requires a pseu- do referent for 'nothing'. Rather, utterances like 'what is not exists' are nonstarters because they lead one back to obvious contradictions like "what is is not." (For example, if what is not exists, then what is not is what is; so what is is what is not, and, then, what is is not.) Of course, it is impossible to recover Parmenides' original reasoning, and it would be a different project to try to do justice to the exten- sive scholarship that tries. Here, working with this minimal starting point has the virtue of forcing an interpretation of what, exactly, Parmenides might have found contradictory about time. It will become clear that, even if Parmenides would endorse, as a general recipe, the identity of what can be thought and what can be, he does not use either a theory of nous or a theory of reference to reject time. Time is not rejected because one cannot cognitively entertain becoming, or, because one must always refer to what exists now. The motivation and argument go the other way: the appearance of becoming and reference to past and future things are not on the right path because mortal's temporal utterances can be exposed as "backward turning" and "two-headed." III What makes them backward turning? Parmenides indicates tempo- ral thoughts involve trying to think what is not is, but, again, it is not illuminating simply to treat this as involvement with the semantically</page><page sequence="9">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 581 problematic "nothing exists." Again, for example, in thinking of past events as "what is not" it is obvious one is not thinking nothing (in the manner of Copleston), neither in the sense of thinking of the void nor in the sense of failing to have any thoughts at all. And, contrary to Russell, one is not in philosophical trouble just because one is failing to refer to something which is present or which always exists. Ostensibly, one is claiming successful reference to what exist- ed, and this is rarely thought to be nothing."1 So, what exactly is wrong with believing there are, for example, past (or future) things, things that have or will become? Parmenides rejects time (and change) in a series of brief remarks in fragment 8. Though brief, they can be viewed as systematically erasing the marks of temporality. (1) Neither becoming nor ceasing to be are real; that is, it is impossible for there to be any genesis or annihilation of what is. (2) What exists is motionless and unalter- able. (3) Such temporal terms as 'becoming', 'was', and 'will be' are mere "names" that people erroneously use to try to describe reality. The minimal interpretation suggests what is wrong with believing reality to be temporal is that in so doing one must suppose what is also has the status what is not. People who believe becoming is real must believe there are things (past and future things) that are not, making it look as if not to be is the same as to be. Yet these people also want the being of such things not to be the same as things that are (cf. KRS 247-8). All this is two-headed, doubly backward turning. The argument emerges in the claim that there is no birth of what is real. Parmenides denies there can be any original or ongoing gen- esis of what is: It never was nor will be, since it is now, all together, one, continuous. For what birth will you seek for it? How and whence did it grow? I shall not allow you to say nor to think from not being: for it is not to be said nor thought that it is not; and what need would have driven it later rather than earlier, beginning from the nothing, to grow? Thus it must either be completely or not at all. Nor will the force of conviction allow anything besides it to come to be ever from not being. Therefore Justice has never loosed her fetters to allow it to come to be or to per- ish, but holds it fast. And the decision about these things lies in this: it is or it is not. But it has in fact been decided, as is necessary, to leave the one way unthought and nameless (for it is no true way), but that the "Some talk of "creation," or origin, of the whole universe may be an exception, if it is assumed nothing, or a void, "preceded" the universe in time. It will be argued in section V that even this encounter with nothing need not be very prob- lematic for Parmenides.</page><page sequence="10">582 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY other is and is genuine. And how could what is be in the future? How could it come to be? For if it came into being, it is not: nor is it if it is ever going to be in the future. Thus coming to be is extinguished and perishing unheard of (KRS 249-50). In this passage, several objections are quickly hurled at coming to be and perishing. How should their importance be ranked? The most familiar one involves the idea that only nothing could come from nothing. Some commentators focus on Parmenides' apparent use of a principle of sufficient reason, as if his primary objection is to a cos- mological picture of creation from nothing. W.I. Matson's'2 inter- pretation of Parmenides on this point is that "every real thing must have a real cause.. .reality cannot just pop up out of nothing- noth- ingness by definition not being a real thing"; in a Leibnizian vein, "supposing that Being could come from nothingness, there could be no reason why this event should occur at one time rather than any other-so it could not occur" (ibid., pp. 31-2). But such causal rea- soning should take a back seat to Parmenides' point that trying to think of things coming to be involves the impossible "it [what is] is not." His use of a common causal belief, like nothing comes from nothing, should be put in the context: "even if it were possible for there to be coming to be, only what is not could come to be from what is not." What is wrong with this is that it produces the contra- diction "what is not is." What needs to be made clear is why belief in becoming involves the contradiction "what is is not." The following reconstruction highlights the link between becom- ing and this basic, forbidden contradiction. It takes its cue from the objection that, if what is came into being, or "is ever going to be in the future," then it "is not." In other words, if what is came into being, then there was a time when it "is not"-namely, when, in the past, it was in the future. And if what is "is ever going to be in the future," then what is "is not"--namely, now. Instead of focusing on the causal impotence of nothing, or on semantic tricks with the term 'nothing', this reconstruction elaborates the contradictory character of becoming: (1) To try to think of what is becoming (or the genesis of what is), is to think there is some past (to precede what becomes), and, it is to think there is some future (from whence what becomes issues)- that is, it is to think the past and future are real, part of what is. (2) But mortals also say the future is what is not (and, what is future is what is not). "2A New History of Philosophy, Volume I (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1987).</page><page sequence="11">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 583 (3) So, to try to say there is some future, or to try to think of what is as future, is to try to affirm both what is said to be what is and what is said to be what is not (namely, the future). (4) It is impossible (and forbidden) to think what is is not (or, what is not is). (5) Therefore, no future is really thinkable. (6) Since what is must be thinkable, there can be no future. (7) Similarly, mortals also say the past is what is not (or, what is past is what is not). (8) So, again, to try to say there is some past, or to try to think of what is as past, is to try to affirm both what is said to be what is and what is said to be what is not (this time, the past). (9) Again, this is impossible, and there can be no past. (10) Therefore, there can be no becoming (or coming to be or gene- sis) of what is. This reconstruction presents the way people think about becoming as committing them to treating the past and the future in contradic- tory ways. For what is real to come into being, it must have been future and there must be a past when what comes to be was future. Insofar as people think there is some past and there is some future, they try to put them (and what is in the past or future) on a par with what is-treating to be and not to be the same. Parmenides objects to this kind of backward turning and more: people also claim the past and future are different from what is (after all, the past and the future are not what is now). Such thinking is what Parmenides con- demned when he said, "[mortals are] dazed undiscriminating hordes, who believe that to be and not to be are the same and not the same" (KRS 247, my emphasis). Primarily semantic readings of the complaint about coming to be, focusing as they do on the void and creation, can plausibly say how nothing is treated as the same as something (or nonbeing the same as being), but how do they account for the other part of the com- plaint-that to be is believed to be the same and not the same as not to be? If one goes so far as to think of nonbeing on a par with being, how are they not the same? Rather than fixate on the void and cos- mogony, the above reconstruction of typical thinking about ostensi- bly ongoing becoming gives Parmenides' complaint some bite. In becoming, what is is supposed to be different from what is not, but also, and again as a result of becoming, the same as what is not. Another virtue of this reconstruction, compared now with those emphasizing an a priori principle of causality, is that it can explain why, practically in the same breath, Parmenides attacks both becom- ing and perishing. Perishing (or ceasing to be) involves becoming</page><page sequence="12">584 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and the contradictory character of what is past. Continuing the argument: ( 11) For what is to perish (or cease to be), what is must come to be past. (12) But there is no coming to be (10), and there is no past (9). (13) Therefore, what is cannot perish. (14) 'Thus coming to be is extinguished and perishing unheard of." Causality (or sufficient reason) readings are typically quiet about why Parmenides denies what is can cease to be. No such principles (as opposed to conservation principles) are violated if what is ceases to be. But focusing on becoming provides an answer: besides being "dazed" and "undiscriminating" when imagining the future as a womb where what is is what is not while it waits to be born, mortals are similarly "two-headed" when they imagine the past as a resting place for what is to be what is not. Again, the problem is not that the past is nothing; it is not that people think of the past as containing nothing and are thereby duped into thinking it contains something. Rather, the past is thought to be and not to be. And it is thought to be loaded, but with impossible things-things that are and are not. Later readers have generally failed to appreciate the extent to which Parmenides' attack is, from the beginning, an assault on temporality rather than a mere rejection of genesis as an initial cosmic event. Influenced by religious stories of creation, or by scientific theories of a "Big Bang" preceded by vacuum field states, readers may easily be tempted to see Parmenides as mainly concerned to deny the genesis of the universe from a prior void or nothingness. It may be true that Parmenides rejects the void, but his rejection of "coming to be" is not just a denial of an initial creation event. Nor does it rest on his denial of the void. Actually, it was typical for ancient Greeks to think of the void as what has the potential to become, and, if so, Parmenides could be rejecting the void because becoming is impossible-what is must "fully be." Thus, contrary to the usual tendency to see Parmenides' rejection of time as based on some semantically inspired aversion to the void (or nonbeing or whatever), his rejection of the void may have been motivated by what he took to be the contradictory character of coming to be. And his rejection of coming to be is more general than a denial that what is could come from nothing: there cannot be any becoming (or perishing) because to suppose that whateveris real (even a hypothetical void) undergoes becoming (or perishing) requires the impossible conflation of what is with what is not. IV Logic has become more sophisticated since Parmenides' time, and so it will appear to many that becoming, perishing, and time can be</page><page sequence="13">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 585 rescued from this attack. In particular, paying careful attention to the logical distinctions signaled by grammatical tenses are supposed to allow one to avoid saying what is both is and is not. Indeed, with the assistance of logical quantifiers one should even be able to envi- sion the possibility that what is came to be subsequent to a state of nothingness. Would Parmenides be persuaded? Consider first the benefits of grammatical tenses. Tenses are a way to indicate whether what is talked about is past, present, or future. You read the sentence before this one-the one you are now reading- and this, in turn, is happening before you will read the next sentence. Here, the differences between 'read', 'are reading', and 'will read' help make it clear you read the different sentences at different times. This forestalls the contradiction that you both read and do not read a given sentence by making it clear these different states of affairs obtain at different times. When Parmenides says things like 'what is, is' and 'it is impossible to think what is is not', it is natural to suggest that 'is' should be read as a tensed verb. Then, it is tempting to accuse Parmenides of failing to appreciate the use of tenses to describe time in a noncontradictory way. Thus, what is now exists, but where is the contradiction in saying what is now did not exist? Once upon a time, what is now was future, and when it was future then it was what is not. When it was true that what exists now was what is not, then it would have been wrong to refer to what exists now as "what is." Instead, it should then have been referred to as "what will be." Similarly, at some future time, what is now will be what does not exist. What is (now) will be what is not (then). What is now will be what was. Then, what is will be past. Then, it will be wrong to refer to what is now as "what is." Instead, it should then be referred to as "what was." In this way, one might hope sufficient marks have been invented so the coming to be and perishing of what is can be tracked without losing one's way on the 'what is both is and is not" path. Also, logic can show how to conceive the possibility that what was once true was the proposition 'what is is nothing'. Parmenides is supposed to have rejected such a thought because he took it to be equivalent to the contradiction "what is is what is not," or because he worried one cannot try to think of nothing without transforming it into something, the referent of 'nothing'. By means of its analysis of general (quantified) sentences, modern logic suggests such contra- dictions and semantic puzzles might be avoided by finding a coher- ent paraphrase. In particular, suppose "what is is what is not" is intended to mean the same as "nothing exists." Instead of paradoxi-</page><page sequence="14">586 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY cally reading the latter as talking about something ("Nothing") exist- ing, logic offers the paraphrase: "For all things, x, it is not the case that x exists." Here, it is stipulated 'x' holds a place only for genuine names. Now, if 'nothing' were erroneously treated as a name, then substitution of 'nothing' for 'x' would result in the opposite of what was originally intended: "it is not the case that nothing exists." But logic insists 'nothing' is not a name; instead, it is a term signaling what is here meant is that no names will make the open sentence 'x exists' true. Thus, so far as logic is concerned, there is no contradic- tion or semantic puzzle if one says, "what is true is that nothing exist- ed." All this need mean is, for all would-be names, none of them would make the open sentence 'x existed' true. Combining the resource of tenses with the logic of general exis- tence statements leads to an interpretation of the following table as a picture of becoming. It is a scheme that includes not only becom- ing, but also genesis from nothing and the perishing of what is. to tl t what is [void] tl-things t2-things what is not future things past void &amp; past void, future things t4-things &amp; future things Table 1 The interpretation of this schema can be embodied in a further table showing the kinds of things that would be true at different times: to tl t2 now true now true now true nothing exists nothing existed nothing existed (before tl) t4-things will exist t4-things exist tl-things existed t2-things will exist t2-things will exist t2-things exist Table 2 Criticism of Parmenides' denial of the reality of becoming, of gen- esis from nothing, and of perishing can be summarized in terms of these tables. If his objection to "it is not" is based on contradiction- causing substitutions of 'what is' for 'it', then tenses provide a way to avoid this substitution: substitute instead 'what was' (or 'what exist- ed') or 'what will be' (or 'what will exist'). Table 2 shows how one can try to insist that what is is just what exists in the now, which is sig-</page><page sequence="15">PARMENIDES' REJECT ION OF TIME 587 naled by the appropriateness of the present tense. And the table shows how one can talk about what is not (if it is not because it is not now) by shifting to the correct future or past tense. Additionally, if Parmenides believes what is is a single, undifferentiated entity-a kind of superobject-and if his objection to genesis is grounded on the idea that to think about the genesis of this superobject requires positing a pseudo object (nothing) as prior to the superobject, then one can see how to avoid reference to pseudo objects. All one need say is what was, once upon a time, was the complete absence of what will exist at any later time. In other words, no nameable thing exist- ed. At later times, one can say, "it was the case that, for all x, x does not exist" (remembering that 'nothing' and 'void' are not allowed to be names). 3 v How might Parmenides respond to the tense defense of becoming and perishing? Since he cannot be asked, listen instead to 'Tenseless Martina," an apprentice of his featured goddess. Tenseless Martina speaks: "We enjoy sophistication in logic and grammar, but we must be sure it takes us along the right path. 'Advances' may dazzle some mortals into thinking they have so progressed, when in fact they are just getting more dazed and two-headed. Alas, the dizzying dance of tenses only postpones the realization that mortals treat what is not as if it is and what is as if it is not. "First, however, let me comment on the explanation of the possi- bility that, once upon a time, nothing exists. Offered as substitute for 'nothing exists' is the alternative, 'for all x, if x is a thing (or object), then x does not exist', where it is stipulated only names of would-be things can be substituted for x. This is a marvelous offer- ing which in no way conflicts with our understanding of the firm truth 'whatever is, is'. Mortals believe in the existence of lots of things. They use many names that they are willing to substitute in place of x; this shows they believe 'nothing exists' is false. We, how- ever, have reasons for denying that such 'things'-the objects of the '3Another possible criticism is that Parmenides overreacted to Heraclitus' habit of apparently identifying what exists at one time with what exists at another. Suppose Parmenides wanted to avoid identifying what is with what is not in the way Heraclitus seemed to identify summer and winter. Unless one is talking about spe- cial things (like enduring substances), it is wrong in general to identify things exist- ing at one time with those existing at others. Yet this is lhow Heraclitus tended to describe change, for example, "as the same thing there exists in us living and dead and the waking and the sleeping and young and old: for these things having changed round are those, and those having changed round are these" (KRS 189). Careful use of tenses can put a stop to such contradictory identities.</page><page sequence="16">588 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY phenomenal world of mortals-are real. This may surprise you, but we are actually willing to affirm the truth of your sentence 'nothing exists', if all you allow to be substituted for x are names of the things ordinary mortals think are real. 'What is, is' is compatible with none of these things being what is. It is not we goddesses who are worried that, if no such temporal objects exist, then some paradoxi- cal void, nothing, or some such is what is. It is mortals who say strange things about nothing, and it is mortals (like Plato and Russell) who show an irresistible urge to demand referents for near- ly all their sounds. "We prefer to say simply: whatever is, is. We are not upset if what is is not an object. Ours is the way of truth-not the way of superob- ject. We are comfortable with the correlation: what is (or obtains or is the case) is what makes truth. We still insist, though, that one avoid the path whereby what is not is (or what is not true is true). If one of my sisters, in her enthusiasm, seems to name what is (saying, 'being') no great harm is done. In this case, you may conclude 'for all x, x does not exist' is false, but just for the trivial reason that 'being' names whatever is, and so substitution in this case would yield something equivalent to the contradictory 'whatever obtains does not obtain'. Thus, if 'being' names whatever obtains (even the state void of mortal things), then it must be true that 'nothing exists' is false-according to the analysis offered. (Notice, too, we are not playing games with the word 'nothing'; we are not saying 'nothing exists' must be false because 'nothing' must name something to be meaningful.) We are happy with this result, but mortals may not be. Because, in spite of these extensions of logic, it may be that what 'being' names is quite different from any of the things for which mortals have names. Trying, then, to imagine such a case and fail- ing, mortals might also jump to the contrary conclusion that, after all, 'nothing exists' is true, too. They would be wrong, but not for the silly reason that they (or we) are attempting to use 'nothing' as a name. They would be wrong just because they would not be letting 'whatever is, is' be true. They may not have forgotten being, but they will have forgotten they let my sister use 'being' as a name for whatever is. "So, I allow you to make the sounds 'nothing exists' syntactically safe for predicate logic and for a science of objects named by mor- tals-if this is what you want to do. And by all means, continue to deny the word 'nothing' the status of a name! But do not think that by giving coherent sense to 'nothing exists' you thereby make it pos- sible to negate 'whatever is, is'.</page><page sequence="17">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 589 "Now, on to the incredible powers of tenses. They are like can- dles in a draft: what they show is aetherial-'all is full of light and obscure night at once' (cf. fragment 9). In the dark, flickering flames give mortals dancing images of what seems to be. Similarly, tenses portray what is as if it were just a brief passage in darkness. But the passage is a maze, where things said not to be are yet suffi- ciently located to come to be, and, having been, pass on to a differ- ent place where, again, they are and are not. Tenses may help mortals keep track of where, in their wandering story, they think they are. Tenses keep the tale in hand, so to speak, so it seems one's passage goes from a beginning to an end. For the telling, tenses add drama, but we are concerned with the whole story-the whole of what must be said to be. "The sparkling consistency of tensed logics, in the narrative sphere, cannot hide for long the fact that tense is a path on which 'to be and not to be are the same and not the same'. To see this, ask (using a twentieth-century idiom), what are the truth conditions for tensed statements? For example, look at what is true at t1 in table 2. Suppose you are at that point in the maze. It is easy, then, to say what the truth conditions are for 'tl-things are what is', because t,- things exist then; the light of the present tense allows them to be dis- played, to appear. But what about the past tensed 'nothing existed', or the future tensed 't2-things will exist'? The champion of tense tells the story that what is is only what exists now, so when such a one is at t4 he can do little more than point to table 1 as a collection of what-is and what-is-not marks. But these are just marks, and at t, the marks available then are themselves all just t,-things. The tense champion cannot use real t2-things, for example, to show their location and to make his future-tense sentences true, since, for him, they are not. In desperation, some mortals attempt to conjure hybrid monsters: pres- ent 'facts' about the future (or about the past). But how could there be present facts about either the future or the past without there being future or past things? Even more desperate, some deny there are any truths about the future. But why, then, should there be any truths about the past either? Clearly, this is a path that goes nowhere and has been nowhere. Do such problems not just show that tense is terminally infected with the 'two headedness' of the past and the future? "Mortals of the twentieth century have a more clever way to try to show the reality of time, using what they call a 'tenseless analysis' of the truth conditions of temporal beliefs. I have a weakness for this theory, which is why my sisters call me, 'Tenseless Martina'.</page><page sequence="18">590 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Champions of tenseless time have an easier time with the above questions, for they make full use of table 1 by embracing all of its what-is row. In so doing, they affirm that t-void, tl-things, and t2- things all exist (tenselessly) at to, tl, and t2, respectively. What makes them different times is a long part of the tenseless story, but for our purposes here what is important is simply the idea that, in the tense- less story, things do not come to be or perish in any metaphysical sense-they are. Things exist tenselessly at their temporal locations (not at all temporal locations), and being there they can serve as truth conditions for sentences, tensed as well as tenseless, no matter when these occur. For example, a t2-sentence like the tensed 'tl- things existed' is made true by the existence of tl-things earlier than the tenseless existence of the t2-sentence token, 'tl-things existed'.14 Now, if a tense mortal could relax and see, for a moment at least, that such existence is what makes even tensed sentences true, then he should more readily confess that, after all, he is trying to say what is not (namely, what he says is past or future) both is what is not and what is. In table 1, he puts the void and ts-things in the what-is-not row under tl-this is where he tries to say how they are not the same as what is. But to explain the tl-tensed truths of table 2, he also must refer to the void and t2-things as being what is represented by the what-is row of table 1. To try to hide this two headedness he talks of them as being 'in the past' or 'in the future' (as if he could add a hybrid row to table 1), but if he has them be anywhere he really tries to make them the same as what is. Remember, he does this while also making them different from what is by putting them in the what-is- not row of table 1. "Surely, then, the mortal who believes in the reality of becoming is in a maze that inevitably turns back on itself. If such a mortal does not see even so far as tenseless time-by refusing to grant the exten- sion of the what-is row beyond the moment of his utterance-how can he conjure the truths needed to sustain becoming? Unless there is some future and some past, there is no becoming. Time vanishes if there is only what is at tl, for example. Some mortals, dazed and desperate, claim to have extraordinary vision: they claim to be able to look into the what-is-not and discern the shadowy being of a past and a future. But this is a trick with mirrors or mushrooms. If the 14Tenseless analyses of time have their roots in relational theories of time, theo- ries that hold earlier-than and later-than relations amongst events as more basic, and more legitimate, than any sui generis ontological passage or flux. They have affinity with Leibniz's view of time and have been advanced by Russell, Hans Reichenbach, W.V. Quine, and Adolph Grfinbaum. Here, Tenseless Martina's com- ments are in the spirit of D. H. Mellor's Real Time (New York: Cambridge, 1981).</page><page sequence="19">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 591 status of what is past and what is future is reflected only in the what- is-not row, then they are not-period. Then there is no distinction between 'things' past and future; there is no thing that is coming to be, and there is no thing that is perished. Such things-the things becoming and ceased-are only in mortals' dreams. At this point, the teller of tensed stories might turn again in his maze and grope: 'Well, things do exist in dreams, so why can things not exist in the past or future in an analogous way?' But how? Philosophers have made admirable progress in explaining how the 'what-is-nots' of dreams, literary fiction, and modal discourse can be understood in terms ofjust what is. For future and past entities, however, for things yet to come to be or things perished (and not just dreams of them), it is totally obscure how their being what the believer in becoming needs them to be can be reduced to what exists at some other time, some other present. So, can becoming be more than a dream? "Again, the mortal who believes tenses mark what is from what is not is exposed to be ever two-headed and backward turning. The best a mere mortal can do is admit to equivocation: there exists (tenselessly) what does not exist (tensed) now. To admit this is to admit coming to be and perishing are mere appearance. Tenses do not separate what is from what is not. Instead, they mark off what is from what is-what is experienced or thought (what appears) at one point from what is experienced or thought at another. "But most mortals are incorrigible. Let them take their tensed tales in hand, run their mazes, and be of the opinion what is becomes and ceases to be. Those of you who would like to try some other path can begin by erasing the what-is-not row of table 1. Then you are left solely with what is: 'coming to be is extinguished and perishing unheard of. Leave tenses in their place-in table 2-as mere tracks of mortal wandering." So says Tenseless Martina. For her, tenses only temporarily hide the contradictory character of becoming. But perhaps Tenseless Martina has not been fully forthcoming, for she gives the impression she endorses the reality of tenseless time. It remains to be seen why Parmenides would also reject the reality of tenseless time. VI If Tenseless Martina can use the tenseless theory of time to explain how becoming and perishing are two-headed and backward turning, it might seem Parmenides should be able to endorse the tenseless view of time, which says time is real though metaphysical becoming is not. Such tenseless time is in accord with the vision of some physi- cists and philosophers according to whom the universe is a four-</page><page sequence="20">592 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY dimensional whole, with earlier-than and later-than relations order- ing the tenseless existence of things along one of these dimensions.'5 The appearance of becoming is just a perspectival matter, reflexively involving local, occurrent perceptual or belief states.16 Different states of being, so to speak, are represented in different states of human beings at different locations in their world lines.'7 If Parmenides' point was that truth must be timeless, perhaps he could accept the view that timeless truths are just tenseless truths-truths that are true at every time. If, then, reality is pictured as a four- dimensional whole with no two-headed metaphysical becoming, '5A connection between Parmenides and space-time physics was noted by Kurt G6del while discussing the importance of understanding the implications of the relativity of simultaneity: "it seems that one obtains an unequivocal proof for the view of those philosophers who like Parmenides, Kant, and the modern idealists, deny the objectivity of change and consider change as an illusion or an appearance due to our special mode of perception"-"A Remark about the Relationship between Relativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy," in Albert Einstein: Philosopher- Scientist, Volume II, P. Schilpp, ed. (New York: Harper, 1959), p. 557. Now, howev- er, tenseless theorists tend to see the special theory of relativity as undermining the assumption there is a universal "now," rather than as denying the objectivity of change. 1See Grfinbaum, Modern Science and Zeno's Paradoxes (Middletown: Wesleyan, 1967), ch. 1, and 'The Meaning of Time," in Essays in Honor of Carl G. Hempel, N. Rescher, ed. (New York: Humanities, 1969). See also Mellor, Real Time, ch. 3. '7Tenseless Martina might put it poetically: at each presenting location (at times that include mortal representings of temporal things), Being has beings "presenc- ing" Being. These ecstatic turns of phrase are Heideggerese, but Martina does not care. Heidegger, though, would be shocked by the suggestion of any sameness of doctrine with the tenseless time of analytic philosophy. Much of Heidegger's work can be viewed as poetic transformations of Edmund Husserl's attempt to describe the complex intentional structure of the specious present. (See Husserl's lectures, which Heidegger edited, Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness, J. Churchill, trans. (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1966).) As a phenomenologist, Heidegger gives priority to describing the prescencing of Being from a human perspective. From his point of view, he is adamant: "Whatever is presently present is not a slice of something shoved in between what is not presently present; it is present insofar as it lets itself belong to the non-present"-"The Anaximander Fragment," in Heidegger's Early Greek Thinking, D.F. Krell and F.A. Capuzzi, trans. (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1975), p. 44. This is work: "What has-been which, by refusing the present, lets that become present which is no longer present; and the coming toward us of what is to come which, by withholding the present, lets that be pres- ent which is not yet present-both made manifest the manner of an extending opening up which gives all presencing into the open"-On Time and Being, J. Stambaugh, trans. (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 17. For all the hustle, Martina can smash these lobs: "Only tense mortals worry about their presently present consciousness being a mean slice between nonbeing. We who take the tenseless view see them all as moments which are (tenselessly) part of what is." For other worries about time and consciousness, see my "Becoming and Persons," Philosophical Studies, xxxiv (1978): 269-80, "Ambiguities in the Subjective Timing of Experiences Debate," Philosophy of Science, XLIX (1982): 254-62, and 'The Given and the Self-Presenting," Noius, xix (1985): 347-64.</page><page sequence="21">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 593 could Parmenides accept the reality of time-albeit tenseless time- after all? There are reasons to doubt Parmenides would accept the reality of any kind of time, including the tenseless time of scientifically inspired philosophies. First, Parmenides rejects the reality of change altogether, while tenseless theories of time analyze change as things being (tenselessly) different at different earlier-than/later-than "locations." Second, tenseless theories of time need reality to be diverse, so differences amongst things and events can ground tempo- ral relations.'8 Parmenides, however, totally rejects diversity. In early Greek thought, it was common to view change as a species of becoming and to fail to make a clear distinction between sub- stances (individual things) and qualities.19 An apple's changing from green to red might be described, in Heraclitean fashion: the green apple is and is not; the red apple is not and is. The green apple ceases to be (and becomes what is not) and the red apple (which is not) comes to be what is. Against this background, if becoming and ceasing to be are cited as unreal, it is natural to expect that motion and alteration are automatically in trouble. Even for enduring substances, if one jogs from A to B, his being at B must, it might be thought, come to be after his being at A ceases to be. And the ripening of an apple seems to require the ceasing of its being green and the coming to be of its being red. To the extent any change involves becoming and perishing, Parmenides might reject them all just for being cases of becoming or perishing. It is in one breath that his goddess lumps motion and change of color with becoming and perishing: ...there neither is nor will be anything else besides what is, since Fate fettered it to be whole and changeless. Therefore it has been named all the names which mortals have laid down believing them to be true- coming to be and perishing, being and not being, changing place and altering bright colour (KRS 252). What is important for tenseless time, however, is not change via becoming but change analyzed in terms of diversity. So Parmenides' thoroughgoing monism is the more serious obstacle to his accepting tenseless time. He claims reality is single and undifferentiated. If so, "'A theory of temporal relations becomes part of a theory of object identity, of saying why some clusters of more or less diverse property instantiations should qualify as objects, and, why even more diverse sets should qualify as histories or "space-time careers." '9Cf. Guthrie, p. 43.</page><page sequence="22">594 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY then it cannot be one way (or thing) at one point and some different way (or thing) at another. What is must be "equally balanced": ...it needs must not be somewhat more or somewhat less here or there. For neither is it non-existent, which would stop it from reaching its like, nor is it existent in such a way that there would be more being here, less there, since it is all inviolate: for being equal to itself on every side, it lies uniformly within its limits (KRS 252-3). Although they agree with him about the phenomenal, mortal-rela- tive character of becoming, tenseless time needs variety amongst things and events to be the basis of temporal relations. Parmenides' severe monism, if adhered to, would force the rejection of tenseless time. VII Problems also face those attempts to qualify Parmenides' rejection of time which read him as endorsing some kind of "eternal present." Some commentators have strained to construct some kind of eternity as the mode of being for Parmenides' One, even though they have recognized his total denial of becoming and change. Perhaps they have stumbled on his remark that what is "is now, all together." Here, he seems to emphasize the present, indeed the present tensed, character of reality, but it is a mistake to take 'now' literally or to make it eternal. Kirk, Raven, and Schofield translate the provocative remark: "It never was nor will be, since it is now, all together, one continuous." And they comment: "Probably what Parmenides means to ascribe to what it is is existence in an eternal present not subject to temporal distinctions of any sort. It is very unclear how he hoped to ground this conclusion in the arguments of [fragment 8]" (pp. 249-50). The reconstruction in section III above hopefully makes the grounding clearer, but what do Kirk, Raven, and Schofield mean by 'eternal present'? How can a present, or what is present, be eternal without its being both present and present at all times? Neither is possible for Parmenides. If Parmenides denies the applicability of concepts of the past and future to reality, what concept of the present can be left? It was typi- cal, remember, to link time and change, with changes seen as instances of becoming and ceasing to be. The supposition that time might pass though everything remains the same is uncommon. In modern times it has affinity mainly with the Newtonian worldview, where time is mathematically postulated as a constant, absolute flux, independent of the existence of particular objects. Parmenides'</page><page sequence="23">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 595 view is not Newtonian, so when he denies the reality of change and becoming-when he denies the reality of time-he should hold all temporal concepts to be specious. When becoming is "extin- guished," when past and future being are exposed as contradictory, what is left is not "the present." What is left is neither a moment of dynamic becoming nor something temporally distinguished from the past or future. What is left is not now.20 Next, without some concept of a temporal present, notions of the eternal become problematic. And on any conception of the pres- ent, Kirk, Raven, and Schofield's "eternal present" is in trouble. What is present is supposed to be ontologically ephemeral accord- ing to tensed theories of time, and this (again according to tensed theories) is what makes the present a special moment of time. According to tenseless theories, on the other hand, what is present is just some set of events neither earlier than nor later than some event in question. What makes some of these events special (of pragmatic importance) is that they are simultaneous with a con- scious token capable of falling under the general linguistic type: "[the event] is simultaneous with this token."'2' Importantly, howev- er, according to neither view of time can a present be present at any other time, let alone at all times! So no present can be eternal in the sense of everlastingly being the same present. If Kirk, Raven, and Schofield suppose what is is "eternally present" just insofar as what is is the same throughout time, then they would be assuming the cogency of some notion of temporal passage for a reality claimed not to be temporal-as if Parmenides' reality were still subject to Newtonian time. This would be an injustice. If Parmenides recog- nized that voiding concepts of becoming and change extinguishes time completely, then he should be credited with an early insight- an insight which kept him from saying things like, "what is will be eternally the same in all future nows." When Parmenides abolishes time, what is left is not an eternal present.22 20Something can be said to be present only as part of a network of temporal dis- tinctions. If concepts are "schematized" temporally, Kant claimed, then to think about something as present is to be able to think about its causal relations. Without corresponding relata, the idea of present existence is empty. See the "Anticipations of Perception" and the "Second Analogy" sections of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, N.K Smith, trans. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1965). 21 Cf. Mellor, chs. 2 and 3. 22As further evidence that Kirk, Raven, and Schofield miss the completeness of Parmenides' rejection of time, they worry: "The statement 'it never was nor will be, since it is now, all together' seems to claim not merely that what is will not come to exist, but that it will not exist at all in the future" (p. 250). Again, they must think they are able to imagine Parmenides' changeless reality somehow marching, or failing to march, forward into the future. Their complaint misses the likelihood, as</page><page sequence="24">596 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Here is another suggestion. Guthrie recognizes Parmenides' claim that the "past and future have no meaning in or for reality" implies "the time sequence is abolished." Unfortunately, he credits Parmenides' with a further achievement: the "recognition of eternal as a separate category from everlasting (op.cit., pp. 26-9). This is unfortunate because it is not at all clear what kind of category the eternal would be if it is to be distinct from the everlasting. Guthrie refers to Plato's distinction between the status of Forms and the ever- lastingness of the temporal cosmos, suggesting Parmenides' reality may be "eternal" like Plato's Forms. There is a connection between Parmenides and Plato's attempt to boost his Forms beyond time, but Guthrie has it backward. Plato may have been inclined by Parmenides to suspect what is fully real cannot be subject to time, but he thinks many entities- many Forms-are fully real. Moreover, he takes seriously the prob- lem of trying to understand the relation between Forms and the realm in which temporal appearances come to be and perish. Basically, Plato's skepticism about time stems from his worry that when particulars change they undergo transitions from exemplify- ing one Form to contrary ones, and in so doing there are moments when particulars are neither one nor the other. Plato concludes that becoming, time, and temporal particulars are incompletely intelligible; his reasons for avoiding the troubling gaps in exemplifi- cation involve his analysis of predication, change, and his belief that no Form is named by 'nonbeing'. In the end, though, Plato does not deny that changes happen or that time is real; rather, he denies their full intelligibility-their inability to be fully described in terms of Forms. Forms, however, are not infected by change, and being, so to speak, "above the show" (above the "moving image") they tran- scend time. In Plato's system, it makes some sense to say that Forms are eternally present, namely, the sense in which they are available at any time to be exemplified. But this eternal availability does not capture their temporal transcendence, since Plato also envisages Forms existing independently of (metaphysically prior to) the tem- poral order of particulars. Platonic Forms are themselves supposed argued above, that Parmenides' stand against becoming is fundamental. When Kirk, Raven, and Schofield admit Parmenides probably meant to "ascribe to what is existence in an eternal present not subject to temporal distinctions of any sort," yet they still complain they do not see how he grounded such a conclusion, part of their problem might lie in their idea of an "eternal present." Parmenides would see it to be a despised "turning back" from their recognizing what is is not subject to "temporal distinctions of any sort."</page><page sequence="25">PARMENIDES' REJECTION OF TIME 597 to be atemporal in spite of their being eternally present (available) for particulars.23 The Platonic scheme does not help explicate Parmenides. Unlike Plato, Parmenides extinguishes time and change altogether. Rather than try to use the eternity of Forms as a model for Parmenides' real- ity, one should go in the opposite direction: use the atemporality of Parmenides' reality as a model for the atemporality of Plato's Forms. It may be mysterious, and it may be wrong, but the atemporality of both is meant to be quite different from everlasting presence. Guthrie's trying to point to some kind of eternity that would be different from the everlasting may strike a sympathetic chord with scholars interested in theological efforts to find a way for God to be eternal which would transcend the imperfections associated with mere temporal everlastingness. But this effort is also problematic and anachronistic: a basically anthropomorphic deity who thinks, wills, creates, and effects miracles in the temporal world was sudden- ly required (by later philosophically sophisticated theologians) to conform to a Platonic ideal of being perfect and, therefore, not tem- poral. Simply calling such atemporal existence "eternal" does not illuminate this new usage, nor does it show how it is an advance on the concept of the eternal in the sense of the everlasting.24 Supposing, then, Parmenides' reality is best characterized as atem- poral, what finally should be made of his remark, it "is now, all together?" He may just be emphasizing the completeness of reality. People are familiar primarily with developing things, things that are incomplete, unfinished, or growing. Such things take time to realize their nature-to be fully what they can become. Perhaps the closest Parmenides' goddess could come, using the language of mortals, to indicate that reality is not at all like a developing thing is to use the pop- 2"I have developed this interpretation in "Plato's Time Skepticism," presented at the Eastern Division meetings of the American Philosophical Association, December 1985. It takes as central Plato's remarks in his Parmenides (141f. and 156f.), but see also Timaeus (37f.) and Sophist (249f. and 258ff.). 24In a similar vein, some may try to understand the all-togetherness of Parmenides' One on the model of everything (that has or will happen) being pres- ent to God in one divine glance. But why think such an idea can give new sense to "eternal"? The temptation involves an equivocation, a shift from a presenting (a representation or intuition) of all "eternity" to a presentation (or presence?) that is eternal (always there). There might be a representation of eternity that is itself temporal and not everlasting; given the character of reality, it is harder to think of one that is everlasting. But if God's consciousness of everything is not to be merely everlasting, does this not make it atemporal-and more mysterious? In any case, this does not help with Parmenides: if the diverse temporal world is not real, what is the point of supposing it glimpsed by a singularly eternal (in any sense of "eter- nal") consciousness?</page><page sequence="26">598 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ular belief that only what is now exists-as a present existent, what is now has ostensibly achieved a momentary completeness unmixed with the past and the future. (Remember, of course, this belief turns out to be hypocritical since mortals also try to grant existence to what is past and future). Then, to say what is "is now, all together" could have the force: what is is like what you mortals (in one of your frames of mind) believe present existence to be, namely, unmixed with pseudo entities like the past and future. Unlike the momentary presence of states of developing objects, however, Parmenides' what is is genuinely complete; it has its being "all together" and alone. Mortals, of course, would like to know more about what is com- plete in this remarkable way, marked neither by the what-is-not of a perished past nor by the what-is-not of a merely potential future. The tenseless theorist, inspired by Tenseless Martina, is primed to say it is what the tenseless existence of the world's "career" is like- the events of this career are spread out, yet hang together, along the fourth dimension of a four-dimensional, spatiotemporal plenum. This whole, with its parts, provides (tenselessly) the truth conditions that make tenseless truths eternally true (and tensed statements occasionally true). But this line of thought is a rapprochement with tenseless time, and it would require Parmenides to embrace the het- erogeneity of what is. Any attempt to spread out Parmenides' One in the empiricists' four-dimensional hyperspace fails as its homo- geneity collapses it back into a singularity. Deprived of diversity- the empiricist's basis for spatiotemporal relations-the all-together- ness of Parmenides' One has the well-roundedness of a solitary point. Given Parmenides' severe monism, it is futile to try to describe this singular reality as other than completely atemporal. If, however, what is can be diverse, then mortals can go on with the pro- ject of explaining how their temporal experiences are a part of reali- ty. For, were it not for his monism, Parmenides' turn away from time need only have been a turn from the two-headed ontology of tensed time; it need not have been a turn from the way of tenseless time.
