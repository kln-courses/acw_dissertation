<plain_text><page sequence="1">Europe and the Quest for Home in James Welch's The Heartsong of Charging Elk and Leslie Marmon Silko s Gardens in the Dunes SUZANNE FERGUSON Coping with material and psychic losses of Native America to the incursions of Euramerica has been a central theme of Native Ameri can literary fiction since Mourning Dove and Darcy McNickle in the early twentieth century. That the struggle should take place on the North American continent would seem to be a given, yet two distin guished recent Native American novels are set partly or largely in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Europe. Examination of the Euro pean elements in Leslie Marmon Silko s Gardens in the Dunes (1999) and James Welch's The Heartsong of Charging Elk (2000) is critical to understanding these authors' developing vision of European-Native American interactions, past and present. In these two novels, Welch and Silko can be seen to perform acts of (implicit) reconciliation be tween Native America and Europe, resolving some of the tensions that characterize their earlier works and finding themselves? through their characters?more "at home" in a conflicted world.1 Reading the two novels side by side shows not only the extension of each novelist's own historical thought but also how surprisingly close their impulses are to understand and forgive the sins of the past. In keeping with her Laguna Pueblo background, Silko makes her young protagonist, Indigo, one of the last survivors of a fictional Colorado River tribe she calls the Salt Lizards. Indigo is taken to En gland and Italy by her white "guardians," Hattie and Edward Palmer, in a sort of educational tour in the manner of privileged young Eur americans of the time. She returns home to seek out her older sister (Sister Salt) and their familial homeplace in the desert southeast of</page><page sequence="2">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 35 Needles, carrying cuttings, seeds, and corms of European and South American plants to add to their indigenous gardens. Welch, himself of mixed Blackfeet/Euramerican origins, tells the story of Charging Elk, a young Oglala/Lakota man taken to Europe by Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1889 but left behind in hospital in Mar seille during an influenza epidemic, then stranded because he was mistakenly reported dead.2 Charging Elk's struggles to survive in the urban French culture and find his way home lead through murder, prison, and marriage before he encounters the show again on a sub sequent tour. Both writers have alluded to the germs of their novels as sprouting from their own book tours in Europe, in ways that point to the writ ers' central concerns with reconciliation of European and Native American cultures. Silko describes the sense of kinship she felt when she gave a reading for the first time in Europe: "I could just feel that in that realm, those ancestors are not like human beings who differenti ate, that my German ancestors were right there for me" (Arnold 4). As she continued into Italy she felt "some kind of heightened energy, and it had to do with the old spirits, and that they would come_I felt welcomed. I felt at home" (5). As she began to work on Gardens in the Dunes, her sense of "the presence of the oldest spirit beings right there in Europe" (6)?the nature-worshipers?grew stronger. The tensions between orthodox Christianity and the religions of the earth began to gather about the figure of the garden and that of the Messiah. Pointing out that gardens are significant in "early Christian ity, in the Bible, ... the Koran" (6), Silko links the gardens of her Indian characters to the Ghost Dance, with its central figure of the Messiah, then to the Gnostic gospels that she learned about from biblical scholar Elaine Pagels when they were in the first group of MacArthur fellows together. Ellen Arnold summarizes: "If you set them apart from the politics behind them, people in Europe and the indigenous peoples in the Americas have a lot more in common than they have that divides them" (9). Silko adds, "And those who would make the boundary lines and try to separate them, those are the ma nipulators, those are the Gunadeeyah, the destroyers, the exploiters" (Arnold 9).</page><page sequence="3">36 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 By traveling to Europe, Silko's Indigo learns that past European cultures have recognized spiritual connections to the cosmos?the earth and its bounty?that they honored in art and fetish objects, in ways that she grasps intuitively from her own experience. Through contact with the pagan and Christian past, Indigo and her American guardian, Hattie, both come to understand an interrelatedness of people across cultures and time in their shared respect for the earth and its creatures. A. M. Regier regards the juxtapositions of ancient and modern, tribal and European, as a project of "hybridization" on Silko's part, where culturally hybrid objects "become the medium of a sort of cultural and spiritual transmission plot,... as characters come to extend their senses of self-identity through the accumula tive, anthropological collecting plot of others and selves" (148). For Welch, the problem of Europe for the Native American pre sented itself as an extension of the issues of his 1986 historical novel Fools Crow, after an incident that happened on his book tour in Marseille in which a young Frenchman introduced himself as the descendant of a member of the Wild West who stayed behind and married a Frenchman. At the time, Welch relates in an interview, he paid little attention, but when he got home he began to write about such a figure. When another purported French descendant of a Wild West Indian introduced himself at a reading several years later in Missoula, Welch knew he was onto something. Fascinated by the cultural frisson, he had already begun to work out what would happen to a person dropped into such a situation: "so many possibilities were there" (Perkins 178). In Fools Crow, Welch says, the character "was always within his culture, but the culture was becoming more and more isolated as the white people moved in. But with this guy, he's thrust full bore into this other culture" (Perkins 178). The Heartsong of Charging Elk is thus primarily Welch's explora tion of his Oglala character's confrontation with and adaptation to nineteenth-century French culture, but it is also an exploration of how individuals can achieve cultural integration and, through that, a new identity. It is, in short, a hopeful book with considerable con temporary relevance. Obviously, from his loving descriptions of the French domestic scenes, Welch himself has enjoyed the culture of</page><page sequence="4">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 37 modern Marseille and seeks ways in which the Indian and European can make common ground there. Both authors base their quest for a negotiated wholeness, what I am calling "home," in historical research: Silko's into the Ghost Dance, the Gnostic gospels, European vegetation cults, and the his tory of the rapacious, even at-the-time illicit, nineteenth-century global trade in indigenous plants and artifacts; and Welch's into the participation of Indians in Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the workings of the nineteenth-century French judicial system. An authentic rep resentation of their characters' confrontation with Europe is mani festly important to both writers, not just as "exotic" setting, but as integral to their consideration of Native-white relations, then and now. Welch reveals in an interview that he had first tried writing the book from the perspective of an American professor researching the descendants of his protagonist, but it didn't "work": the real story was relegated to the background (Perkins 176). While enjoying the texture of the fictional settings in both novels, one cannot escape the sense that the research and the work of imag ining the characters are always in the service of an overarching moti vation to bring the strangeness on both sides into a state of equilib rium, where both Native and European characters are understood, accepted, and perhaps forgiven. The fact that both novels are precisely placed in the same time frame is not simple coincidence but a shared search for a critical moment. The main characters of Gardens in the Dunes travel to Italy in the summer of 1900, soon after the assassination of the liberal King Umberto I. The first Colorado River dam at Parker, in the Ari zona Territory, whose construction is the site of the secondary plot, was completed in 1901. Charging Elk goes to Europe with Buffalo Bill's Wild West on its second European tour in 1889 and is released from his French prison in 1904. This is the period of defeat for the Native Americans: the United States?its military, its ever-westering settlers?has taken over Indian Country, relegated the Native Ameri cans to reservations, and forced their children into schools in which they are forcibly separated from their cultural past, their families, their homes. It is at this juncture that the Ghost Dance?a move</page><page sequence="5">38 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 merit that in its origins, at least, incorporates Christian concepts of the return of a peaceful messiah who will remove the evil elements so that his people can live an Edenic existence in harmony with earth and their fellow humans?arises and is brutally quashed. Silko's In digo agrees to go to Europe with the Palmers in part because the al ternative is to return to the oppressive (and historically real) Sher man Institute in Riverside but in part because she hopes to find evidence that the Messiah and his family, along with her mother, may have returned to his home in the East.3 Thus the journey to Europe is a quest for healing and reunion with her mother, as well as the hoped-for culmination promised by the Ghost Dance religion. Welch takes up the story of Charging Elk almost as a sequel to Fools Crow, which ended shortly after the Marias Massacre and be fore the Little Bighorn. Although Lakota rather than Blackfeet, Charg ing Elk could almost be Fools Crow's son. He chooses to join the Wild West, as did the Sioux holy man Black Elk as a young man, to learn about the world of the Euramericans (Black Elk and Neihardt 214-15) but also because he senses that his way of life as a "wild" In dian living away from the reservation is inevitably coming to an end.4 Left behind in Manchester with other Indians when they missed a boat in 1887, Black Elk was found and sent home when the Wild West returned to Paris in 1889 (Kasson 189-90). Charging Elk remembers witnessing Black Elk's return to the show and Buffalo Bill's kindness to the holy man (Welch 57-60). Other Indians from the Wild West did die in the influenza epidemic of 1889-90 in hospitals both in Marseille and in Spain (Bridger 354-55). One named Featherman, who becomes a character in the novel, died of smallpox contracted in Marseille. Welch notes in his acknowledgments having seen Feath erman's death certificate (440; see also Moses 82,94). By working so closely with historical sources, on the one hand, yet diverging from Black Elk's story by having Charging Elk remain in France, Welch bestows on his character the freedom not to have to confront the op pression of tribal life, a lonely freedom to find his individual destiny. In contrast to Welch's concentration on the subjectivities of his characters in a geographically focused setting, Silko's scene is pan oramic, as her characters cross the United States by rail, travel to Eu</page><page sequence="6">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 39 rope by ship, move by boat and rail across that continent from En gland to Italy and Corsica, then return. Edward Palmer sails up the Amazon in search of orchids and rubber plants, prowls the markets of Tampico for saleable curiosities, and prospects for meteor "dia monds" in northern Arizona. The settings range from an orange grove estate in Riverside, California, and the dam construction camp at Parker to an Edith Wharton-style mansion on Long Island, an English medieval cloister and the archeological digs at Bath, a Re naissance-era house and garden in Lucca, and a small rural town in Corsica. In every locale greed and folly are shown to join in the de struction of the environment and the repression of persons. At the same time, sympathetic characters?mostly females?appear in each primary location to show Indigo that peaceful integration is pos sible. Welch, who most unfortunately passed away in 2003, was gener ally much less overtly political than Silko, and remains so in Heart song, though he creates a touching picture of the individual caught in a rigid and self-serving French bureaucracy (one reviewer correctly called it "Kafkaesque" [Knickerbocker 16]) as Charging Elk tries to prove who he is (and that he's alive, not dead) in order to get repatri ated. As in earlier books, Welch works with great attention to psycho logical depth and to the novelistic techniques for achieving that depth, using his storytelling to feel out how people cope with the inevitable, how they live out their beliefs and dreams in an alien cul tural context. Where Fools Crow had no choice but to live in a dimin ished world in his native home, Charging Elk, though isolated, is shown to be mostly free: free to leave his sponsor family, to change jobs, to pursue a wife, and, once released from prison, to remain in France and choose his own dwelling place. Charging Elk's spirituality is central to his quest and its resolu tion. At the beginning of the novel, Charging Elk may remind us not so much of Fools Crow's eponymous hero as its renegade Blackfeet, Owl Child (also based on a historical figure), who pursues adventure and finally gets too much of it. In the case of Charging Elk, his being thrust so abruptly among Europeans with whom he cannot commu nicate orally or culturally challenges every point of his prior experi</page><page sequence="7">40 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 ence. Unlike Owl Child, Charging Elk holds to his traditional reli gion, although his interest in the religious practices of the French and his attraction to their churches motivate some of the most poignant confrontations of his experience. Like Fools Crow, Charging Elk believes in his dreams as prophetic and tries to live in accordance with what he can discern that the Great Spirit, Wakan Tanka, intends for him. When he is threatened by rowdy, Indian-hating American sailors at the port, he sings his death song, only to find that it frightens his attackers and saves his life. This event, about three years into his exile (203-04), causes him to feel that perhaps it was his destiny to be in Marseille and embold ens him to make himself more at home in dress and behavior. Later, when Charging Elk, in jail for murder, receives cigarettes from a dandy newspaper reporter he calls "Yellow Breast," he recognizes the offering as ritual tobacco and begins to take hope that he may be res cued again: "Wakan Tanka had sent Yellow Breast to him twice now. Perhaps there was a plan after all? Charging Elk stared at the small yellow flame [of the match] and dared to hope just a little" (306). Welch does not portray Charging Elk as completely abandoned and alone: along with Yellow Breast, other Europeans befriend him. Christians are repeatedly shown to exercise their faith and ideals in their treatment of the stranger. Even sexual exploitation is a catalyst for emotional discovery as well as brutality, as Charging Elk patron izes then falls in love with a prostitute, who reluctantly betrays him to a wealthy homosexual whom Charging Elk kills as a siyoko, or "evil ness," when the man drugs and molests him.5 Charging Elks experi ence with the French court and prison system opens doors of his mind as well as closing them. As the North American continent caused the "American" to be come, in Crevecoeur s formulation, "this new man," France causes Charging Elk to remake himself, learning, for example, to eat fish and work with a fishmonger although he was brought up to shun such food (and vomits up the first fine bouillabaisse his French sponsors offer him as a treat); learning to farm although he was raised a hunter; and learning to dress in a European style, to live in an apart ment, and to court a woman in the European way. After a decade and</page><page sequence="8">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 41 a half in France, much of it as a convict, although he feels deep nos talgia when he visits the Indian "camp" of the Wild West, his respon sibility to his French wife and child-to-be, along with his recognition that even the Indians have changed, lead him to refuse the opportu nity to return to America. Described in a schematic way, the book might be seen as a fable, a clever reversal of the "young man from the country" European plot that shows us the noble savage coping with absurd or cruel custom.6 But the texture Welch creates is anything but fabulist, with the kind of richness of psychological and physical detail we associate with the realistic novel from the nineteenth century to the present. For Charg ing Elk, who as a child witnessed the aftermath of the battle the Indi ans called the "Greasy Grass" and Americans called "Little Bighorn" and the subsequent surrender of his tribe to reservation life, the no tion of home is forever ruptured, although he does not realize this at first and longs to return there.7 Welch, himself a "mixed-blood" per son who participated in Euramerican culture in professional and personal relationships from his youth, seems to say that understand ing and adaptation rather than return allows people to find their ap propriate places, even in the face of loss. Charging Elk will never re cover the kind of community he had in his youth, because?as he learns from his prophetic dreams and the narrative of the Wild West Sioux he visits at the end of the novel?that kind of community has disappeared. His choices for a French wife and family may seem di minished and even sad to the reader, yet they are in the end repre sented as good choices for Charging Elk. He says to Joseph, the young show Indian who urges him to return with Buffalo Bill, I am not the young man who came to this country so long ago. ... I speak the language of these people. My wife is one of them and my heart is her heart. She is my life now and soon we will have another life and the same heart will sing in all of us. (437) Silko, for her part, creates a homecoming that is on the one hand romantic: her sisters are reunited, the next generation has been born with ancient knowledge, the new plants grow up beside the old, and a new spirit snake appears beside the spring where an old snake has</page><page sequence="9">42 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 been brutally killed. On the other hand, Silko's vision is polemic and moralistic: exploiters of the earth (at least some of them) are pun ished while their victims survive and thrive by subsistence farming and respect for persons, plants, and animals. Silko ties her ecological theme to a feminist one: in the end, Hattie Palmer, whose feminist thesis was rejected by the Harvard Divinity School (where she was a special student after graduating from Vassar) and whose (celibate) husband uses her and Indigo as a cover for his plant stealing activities in Corsica, leaves her materialistic American family to find her home with an eccentric spiritualist aunt in England, where her ideas will be condoned, even welcomed. By bringing together the feminist and ecological themes, Silko shows that they are interdependent: the Catholic Hattie begins in a religious tradition that in its "orthodox" form does not accept women as equals of men. Priests are celibate, Gnostic stories of Mary Magdalene as an honored disciple are "heretical," and one of the Church's key precepts is that "Man" should govern the earth and its denizens, a carte blanche for exploitation. The scenes of destruction of nature are horrific in such episodes as when a fire is deliberately set to destroy Brazilian orchid habitat by pirates working for a respected European conglomerate of collectors and botanical gardens, simply to make those that have been stolen the more valuable;8 or when a huge copper beech tree is uprooted and transported to be a garden party ornament at Hattie's high-soci ety sister-in-laws estate on Long Island; or when we are shown the protracted drying up of the Colorado river bottom agricultural lands as the dam diverting its water to California begins to take effect. The gardens in the dunes are an idyllic place of refuge and restora tion: though seemingly arid, by careful husbanding and respect for water sources, they can be made to flourish. Silko's anger at Ameri can consumption and destructiveness came to a head in Almanac of the Dead (1991), her sprawling and violent novel set in contemporary Tucson and El Paso. As she notes (somewhat tongue-in-cheek), Gar dens is the "reward" to the reader for suffering through Almanac (Arnold 7). In Gardens, she looks to the past sources of the "vast care</page><page sequence="10">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 43 lessness" that Scott Fitzgerald also saw as symptomatic of American greed and excess, drawing them together in both a warning and a hope. There is still plenty of anger for Silko to work through. It is not just Indians who suffer from prejudice and violence. The conse quence of Hattie's presumption in challenging the professors is sim ply being disgraced by the rejection of her thesis proposal on the Gnostic Magdalene gospels, but her subsequent opportunistic mo lestation by a male fellow student causes her to have a nervous break down. Her later presumption in patronizing Indians (along with her apparent possession of portable worldly goods) results in her brutal rape and robbery as she attempts to bring supplies to Indigo and her sister near the end of the novel. Silko allows Hattie a measure of re venge: discovering evidence of some of her stolen artifacts at the liv ery stable in Needles, whose owner's son she has suspected of the crime, Hattie sets a fire in the stable. In a reverse mirror image of the orchid fire, Hattie s fire sweeps through the corrupt town, thus purg ing at least some of the evil that has occurred there, before she leaves the area permanently. The figure of Europe in Gardens in the Dunes may seem at first almost gratuitous. In a sense, most of Silko s "points" about rapa cious exploitation and the healing power of the garden could be made without any journey beyond Long Island. But as she has re vealed in interviews, Europe fascinated her and suggested ancient links between Europeans and Native Americans. Besides the German experience, she talks about the spring rite of Fasching in Z?rich, in which carnivalesque revelers dress in blackbird masks and roam the streets; later in Italy with her Italian translator Silko was surrounded by blackbirds, as she is at home in Arizona (Arnold 4-6). These blackbirds are associated in the novel with the coming of the Messiah and appear in Aunt Bronwyn's English garden and Laura's garden in Lucca, confirming for Indigo the Tightness of her instinct in willingly going to Europe with the Palmers. Another link seems to be with Silko's Scots ancestors, who were "stone worshippers," as Silko is (Arnold 7). One motif linking the European sections of the novel to those set</page><page sequence="11">44 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 in America is the archaeological evidence at Bath of priapic and yonic fertility cults from pre-Christian times; other such figures ap pear in the elaborate Italian garden of Laura, Aunt Bronwyn's friend, a professoressa who has separated from her disgraced husband and lives happily on her own. Anthropomorphic figures of snakes cause important epiphanies for both Indigo and Hattie, who immediately sense the connectedness across time and culture. For Regier, Indigo's reaction to one of the figures forms a "crisis point," an original hybridity that positions the human form not in bi nary separation from the animal world, but which integrates female and snake forms, human and animal relations, just as such systems and ways of being were presented as integrated in Indigo's early life experiences in the gardens in the dunes. (149) These ancient cults, with their veneration of the sexual, echo the Sand Lizard people's acceptance of sex as a basically friendly gesture that might lead to tribal affiliation. Sister Salt reviews the principle: "Sex with strangers was valued for alliances and friendships that might be made" (202). This attitude precludes jealousy and is con trasted both to the unconsummated marriage of Hattie and Edward and to the illicit affair Hattie's sister-in-law is carrying on with her Scots gardener, witnessed by Indigo: "Sister Salt once warned her never to peek at white people having sex or they'd go crazy and come after you" (192). Fortunately for Indigo, Susan Palmer simply tries to buy her silence by giving the girl a parrot, a formerly wild bird pining away on Long Island.9 Hattie and Indigo recognize evidence of primitive earth "spirits" in England (in the excavations at Bath and a ruined abbey built on top of earlier animist religious sites), and also in Italy, especially in Laura's gardens in Lucca, as indicating the layeredness of human ac tivity over time. This persistence of a benevolent spirit in spite of cruelty and exploitation allows Hattie to return to live with her aunt in England, while Indigo is reunited in the desert with her sister, bearing seeds, black gladiolus corms from Laura, and some of the contraband orchids. The latter are a final reconciliation gift from Ed ward, whose cupidity and gullibility lead to his death at the hands of</page><page sequence="12">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 45 a quack and criminal physician partner while pursuing a specious mining venture in northern Arizona, in the process finishing off the remainder of Hatties marriage settlement. Indigos success in grow ing the Old World seeds in the gardens in the dunes affirms change and growth within the family, just as the "mixing" of Indian and black blood in the "little grandfather" baby of Sister Salt does. A corollary of this affirmation in Gardens is the transcendent "value" of beauty, which is only apparently at odds with practical value. Not only the orchids but the gladioli hybridized by the Italian professoressa have no value as food (in contrast to the contraband citrus cuttings that get Edward into jail on his return to Italy from Sicily) but are valued by Indigo for their loveliness. She later discov ers one can eat the gladiolus corms, but that is merely an amusing "bonus," as she keeps and plants them regardless. The gladioli also come to serve as a peace offering from Indigo and her Chemehuevi friends Maytha and Vedna to the Christian Indians with whom they have been feuding: they take buckets of the brilliantly colored flowers to the church and find the empty buckets returned for more. The neighbors, who were flooded out by the completed dam, "received all sorts of food donations from other churches each month; but no one up or down the river had such tall amazing flowers for their church. So those flowers turned out to be quite valuable after all" (475). If those who freely share abundance and beauty are rewarded with freedom and "home," those who try to make money on the sto len bioresources are either frustrated (the "company") or killed (Ed ward). Those who make money out of the plunder of the river are similarly foiled. Even Sister Salts lover, the black cook and gambling entrepreneur Big Candy, has all his savings from the project stolen by a Mexican woman who is getting together arms for the Mexican revolution. Obsessed with the loss, Candy leaves Sister Salt and their baby and follows the Mexican woman eastward across the desert, nearly dying of hunger and thirst, but Silko allows him to be rescued and, again ironically, to end up driving the wagon with all the guns into Mexico as a way to raise some cash after he reaches Tucson. All his "sweetness" has turned to dust; his desire to settle down has been crushed.</page><page sequence="13">46 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 The Ghost Dance?that strange amalgam of messianic Christian themes and the fervent wish that the whites might just disappear from North America?links the two books to those of other Native American writers, but its uses are distinctive in these novels. The Ghost Dance in both novels can be seen as a critique of conventional Christianity, which rarely seems to practice what it preaches where persons and property are concerned. In Silko's representation of the Ghost Dance?a vision of the Paiute prophet Wovoka in 1888?the Messiah, Christ, has a family that includes a wife and children. As Silko shows it, the Indians and neighboring Mormons employ fast ing and dancing as a ritual to summon the Messiah and his family, who will bless them and free them from the oppressively hegemonic Euramericans.10 Regier finds the Ghost Dance central to the "hybrid ization" theme of the novel: "Silko's conception of Wovoka offers a culturally syncretistic... version of a messiah" (140) that is available to all races in the present. Historically, the Ghost Dance movement was drastically dis rupted by the cavalry attack at Wounded Knee in December 1890, but remnants did persist. Silko admits that she "moved" a Ghost Dance from 1893 in Kingman to Needles for her novel (Arnold 7). In Europe, Indigo is able to identify several sites she visits with verses from the Ghost Dance chants she learned at Needles (262-65). In Silko's novel, the Ghost Dance, with its benevolent figures of Jesus and his family, is a kind of modern heresy that links Hattie's research into alternate Christian histories with Indigo's quest for her mother. This Ghost Dance messiah is always just over the horizon, never "here" (like the Krishna of Forster's Professor Godbole), but it is important for the people to keep seeking him, to keep trying to summon him. For Welch, the Ghost Dance suppression seems one of the factors cutting Charging Elk off from his past. His vision of the dance itself comes to him in a dream early in the novel. It was not rhythmic and graceful like the old-time dances; rather the people hopped and twirled in place, men shouting and wailing, women ululating and crying out_some of the dancers fell to the ground, where some lay motionless while</page><page sequence="14">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 47 others twitched and rolled around as though they were strug gling to leave their bodies. (126) The style of the dancing matches that in Gardens in the Dunes and apparently came from Wovoka's contact with Shakers, whom he en countered as teenager in the hops Welds of Washington and Or egon.11 Although Charging Elk was already in Europe by the time of the massacre of the Ghost Dancers at Wounded Knee, Welch has Charging Elk dream that scene as well. In his troubled vision he is futilely trying to jump off a cliff back in the Stronghold: He tried four times, five times, ten times, but each time the wind pushed him back, until he was exhausted from his labors. But the next time he approached the cliff, too weak to even at tempt to jump, he looked down and he saw his people lying in a heap at the bottom. They lay in all positions and directions? men, women, and children, even old ones. They lay like buffaloes that had been driven over the cliffs by hunters, and Charging Elk understood why he had been weeping. (235) Charging Elk cannot interpret these dreams until the visiting Lakotas in the Wild West relate the events to him near the very end of the book. He recounts the frightful visions to his hosts but manages to wrest some hope from the very fact that these Lakotas now appear before him. All the Lakotas were not "vanished from the earth," as he had feared from his dreams: "We will go on because we are strong people, we Lakotas." The show Indian "smiled for the first time, un certainly but perhaps a little hopefully. 'I don't know?maybe'" (435). Yet in reality, it is Charging Elk who has "disappeared" from America. Written off as dead by a French doctor, he is presumed dead by the Wild West and most likely by his parents. Though hugely visible among the short Frenchmen of Marseille, he is also in a sense invis ible because of his difference in France. Most Frenchmen simply ig nore him, and for much of his early time in Marseille he courts "in visibility" (200). Charging Elk's time in prison for the murder is less punishment than a continuance of his reeducation. While incarcerated he learns</page><page sequence="15">48 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 the peaceful art of gardening, with its orderly seasonal tasks, which Welch describes almost ritualistically: Eight months a year, from early March to the end of October, he spent his days in the terraced gardens or in the apple and almond orchards at the bottom of the hill. In the spring, he pushed a wheeled plow to break up the hardened soil, spread manure, mixed it in, and raked it smooth. He planted radishes and onions, leeks and peas and tomatoes. Then he tended them through the growing season, watering the plants, weed ing and watching for pests. From mid to late summer he har vested vegetables, picked apples, and shook down the olives and almonds. In the fall after the first frost, he pulled the spent plants, pruned the trees, and cleaned up debris. He repaired tools, sharpened hoes and shovels, straightened up the tool room and the greenhouse. (356-57) These activities keep Charging Elk sane and whole for seven years. He is then released, thanks to the efforts of a Catholic Relief Society in Marseille, which has by some convoluted legal interpretation had him reclassified as a political prisoner: he was tried as a U.S. citizen, but his tribe is a separate nation "and therefore not subject to the legal agreements between the United States and France" (361). In an ironic reversal of the original refusal to repatriate him because he was not a U.S. citizen, the French now set him free. To aid his reentry into society, his mentors place him as a gardening assistant with the rural French family whose daughter, Nathalie, he ultimately marries. These European gardens are more benign, closer to "home," than Silko's Long Island garden for which whole trees are transported and multitudes of spring flowers are artificially forced for one evening of bloom in the hot summer, all because they fit the hostess's color scheme. When Charging Elk first sees the landscape outside his prison, he feels he "had never seen a more beautiful sight. Not even the smoky-black Paha Sapa could compare with such colors and lushness" (355). These fields are in fact much more similar to the or dered and colorful garden that Indigo plants along the lower Colo rado. When Maytha and Vedna visit, they admire the "effect of the</page><page sequence="16">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 49 color combinations Indigo made with the gladiolus she planted in rows to resemble corn kernels" (476). The benevolence of Europeans on their home ground is also found in Welch's "Christian" French family, who are idealists acting in a principled way that grows into firm affection towards Charging Elk, and in the several French Catholic charities that help him, as well as the very secular rabble-rousing reporter Yellow Breast. All are more humane than the unseen "Christian" Americans who have sto len his home and massacred his tribal relatives, or Silko s "Christians" who refuse to acknowledge Hattie s thesis and those who torture and kill not only the Indian Ghost Dancers but also the Mormons who participate in the Ghost Dance. Europe, in these books, is in some ways the Europe of James or Hemingway, the estranged "other" with which the American?white or Indian?must come to terms, but it is more benign than the "America" the Indians have left behind.12 The fictional Europes of Silko and Welch are symbolic places where new perspectives on Na tive American experience can be achieved, where Euramerican prej udices and covetousness can be set aside and a longer historical view of humanity can emerge. Urban Marseille becomes for Charging Elk a kind of neutral space where he and his French wife can construct their own "normal" life. In fact, removed from her rural home by the death of her mother and her cousins inheriting the farm where she has always lived, Charging Elk's wife, Nathalie, is also lonely and dis possessed. However, we see both of them in the end trying to make a positive life as best they can, hopefully anticipating the birth of their child. In James Welch, A Critical Companion, Mary Jane Lupton re veals that Welch in 2002 was preparing to return to France to do re search for a sequel that would take Charging Elk up to 1918 and return him to America (132). Such a return would indeed be a challenge to the kind of argument I have made, and one can only imagine a darker outlook for its conclusion. The future for Indigo back in Arizona is unclear: as long as the sisters and "the little grandfather" baby of Big Candy and Sister Salt can stay hidden among the dunes, they are safely "at home," but they never give up the hope of finding their mother again. To do that they</page><page sequence="17">50 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 will have to venture beyond the dunes. Hattie is safely at home in England, but we presume permanently celibate as well as estranged from her parents and separated from Indigo, whom she loves. Louise Barnett sees her departure as "exile": "Her intellectual feminism,... is neither useful nor valuable, to herself or to others" (28). Angelika K?hler, however, takes a more positive view of Hattie's resolution: "Claiming her right to individual choice, she develops into a spiritual seeker who finally discovers her homeland in Europe among Celtic runes and Roman statues" (241). In both novels the transport of the Indians to a European setting shows that people of different races and cultures can learn to live to gether in reciprocal affection and respect if they are willing to make the effort, at least away from the contested ground of America. The European "connection" reflects Silko's perception?experienced on the tour publicizing Almanac?of the interconnectedness of human sensibility when not corrupted by greed and selfishness: "Our human nature, our human spirit, wants no boundaries, and we are better beings, and we are less destructive and happier. We can be our best selves as a species, as beings with all the other living beings on this earth ... without those divisions" (Arnold 9-10). Thus, Welch's and Silko's explorations of the past and of Europe suggest the possibility of reconciliation and the hope for a new kind of home, a home con structed by individuals of goodwill who manage to overcome grief and loss through spiritual ties with each other and with the natural world. NOTES l. Denise Cummings, writing in SAIL in 2000, provides a densely argued theoretical grounding for Silko's uses of history in all her books. She summa rizes, I understand Silko in her traditional stories, her bricolage, her scath ing criticism of Western culture, and her use of the nineteenth century novel form as trying (perhaps unconsciously) to reveal the illogic of the dominant discourse while simultaneously using the dominant forms to rewrite history. (73)</page><page sequence="18">Ferguson: Europe and the Quest for Home 51 2.1 use the French spelling "Marseille," since Welch does in the novel. 3. Silko notes that her grandfather, Henry C. Marmon, was a student at Sherman, as well as the "Gladiolus Man" of her family (Arnold 4). 4. Black Elk is a significant source for Welch in his account of how Charg ing Elk was left behind. Black Elk and several others missed their ship in Manchester in 1887. After traveling with other Wild West shows, Black Elk became ill and was taken in by a French "girl friend" and her family. In Black Elk Speaks, he recalls, "There was a Wasichu Girl who came to the show very often. She liked me and took me home to see her father and mother. They liked me too and were good to me. I could not talk their language. I made signs, and the girl learned a few Lakota words" (Black Elk and Neihardt 224 25). Welch has Charging Elk make friends with a Parisian girl, Sandrine, be fore the show moves on to Marseille, learning a few French words and teach ing her some Lakota; Sandrine remains his image for the possibility of crossing the cultural divide. His relations with his "foster family" in Marseille are also reminiscent of the sketches provided by Black Elk. When Black Elk later fell ill with homesickness, he was taken to the Paris home of his girl friend, where he fell into a trance and had a vision of traveling on a cloud all the way back over the ocean to Pine Ridge, where he saw his family. The cloud returned him to Paris, where he awoke to find funeral preparations being made for him (227-28). Charging Elk also dreams of being home. Other elements of Black Elk Speaks appear in Heartsong, as well: Black Elk's account (supplemented by two of his contemporaries) of the Custer battle, his fear and misery crossing the ocean in the "fire-boat" (where like Charging Elk he began to sing his death song), his description of the Ghost Dance. Other important sources for Heartsong came from Welch's historical re search for both Fools Crow and the 1994 nonfiction Killing Custer (with Paul Stekler). 5. The similarity to N. Scott Momaday's Abel's killing of the albino "witch" in House Made of Dawn is notable. But the siyoko Breteuil's motiva tion and behavior are all too human, not mysterious. 6. Brigitte Frase writes, During the Enlightenment the French were much taken with the liter ary figure of the naif. In sunny didactic tales, the noble savage would be very much at ease in Paris, full of perspicuous observations about European culture and deep natural wisdom about the best ordering of a society. The Heartsong of Charging Elk is the melancholy revision of such optimism about the meeting of cultures. (20)</page><page sequence="19">52 SAIL SUMMER 2006 VOL. l8, NO. 2 7. Details of Charging Elk's account of the battle parallel those of Black Elk. Cf. Welch, Heartsong, n, 57-58, and Black Elk and Neihardt, Black Elk Speaks, 103, where Standing Bear, whom Neihardt characterizes as a "long hair" friend of Black Elk, speaks. Welch's research for Killing Custer is also evident here. 8. See, for example, Luigi Berliocchi's account (29); other descriptions are prominent in Susan Orleans best seller The Orchid Thief. 9. A bit improbably, the bird is taken along to Europe and returns with Indigo to Arizona, where they are reunited with the monkey that originally belonged to Edward but becomes Indigo's, a plot development that pro voked the book's characterization by Suzanne Ruta in the New York Times Book Review as "part Victorian children's book" (31). 10. There are numerous versions of the meaning of the Ghost Dance. Some call Wovoka the "Paiute messiah," but Wovoka seems to have backed away from that idea; he in fact repudiated his vision prior to the massacre at Wounded Knee when he found it corrupted and led to violence. Wovoka lived well into the 1920s as a public figure. See Bridger, Buffalo Bill 364-67, 394-95; Niezen, Spirit Wars, 130-36. An important collection of sources and commentaries appears in Michael Hittman's Wovoka and the Ghost Dance. 11. Bobby Bridger explains: "The Shakers were ascetic Christians who, as the 'Whirling Dervish' sects of Sufi Muslims, believed a heightened state of awareness and prophecy could be obtained through 'agitated' or ritualistic dancing" (166). 12. Angelika K?hler has suggested the James-Silko connection is a "com mon basic assumption ... that both national and cultural identity exist as something to be made, not something given" (243).
