<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Foundations of Corporate Responsibility james B. Wilbur ABSTRACT. The thesis of this paper is that corporate activity can best be understood on analogy with the acitivity of persons. The ground for this analogy lies in the nature of activity itself which is common to both and to find a ground therein an analysis of the features of activity is presented based upon a comparison of 'activity' and 'process' by Alburey Castell. Activity is said to be bi-polar with one pole the purpose or goal to be handled in utilitarean fashion and the other pole concerned with the maintenance of the presuppositions of activity. While any goal chosen will have hypothetical 'oughts' as its conditions, it is argued that the presuppositions of activity are categorical 'oughts' in that they cannot be denied without asserting them. And since one of these presuppositions is freedom of choice, thus giving activity the power to destroy its own possibility, these presup positions function in the context of practice as categor ical norms and are universal in their applicability as pre serving the possibility of responsible activity for every one else as well as myself. All activity whether it be other-regarding or self-regarding (self-interest in the business world) is subject to the norms of its own pos sibility, its enabling conditions, and this constitutes the moral ground for personal, managerial and a basis for inquiry into corporate responsibility. All of these ideas are put forth within the wider con text of the problem of corporate legitimacy and consti tute a prolegomena to it. Without any doubt at all, corporate structure is the most pervasive form of organization in our society. It has been the engine of our growth and development over the last one hundred and fifty years. It has been given special considera tions by government in recognition that its /. B. Wilbur, Philosophy Dept., SUNY, Geneseo, N.Y. 14454. activity is central to our progress as a people and as an inducement to more of the same. And it has been filling up the social space between the individual and the nation state (and beyond) by leaps and bounds. Even government structure itself at all levels is perhaps best understood in the same terms, as a variant on general corporate structure. But setting aside the sense in which government on the federal, state and local levels is corporate, my concern lies with the huge number of public corporations which are, again past doubting, by far the most powerful elements in our society. Much is being said now about the responsibil ities of the corporate community starting at the traditional center with duties to stockholders, radiating outward through those to consumers and the general community and coming to rest on corporate responsibility to the total environ ment including the support systems for the bio sphere. But all the while, very little helpful is being said about the foundations of all this responsibility. Why should corporations be re sponsible? What is usually given in reply is a litany of the duties of business and the attitudes of managers which rests either on some assumed sort of 'self-interest' which becomes more 'en lightened' as it reaches beyond narrow selfish concerns or on the fact of community pressure. The former might work very well if in fact my interests fall somewhere along this range of in creasing enlightenment, but it says precious little about why I 'ought' to be interested at all. The latter is straight power talk of the 'might makes right' variety and provides no basis for the deter mination of which pressures should be bowed to and to what extent and which pressures should be resisted. Both of these attempts to ground responsibility deprive such talk of any sense of lournal of Business Ethics 1 (1982) 145-155. 0167-4544/82/0012-0145$01.10.

Another way of writing about these matters, much in use now, is the ideological approach. Corporate activity is found to be an expression or function of a certain set of beliefs or values at a certain time. Now, under changing condi tions, this set of beliefs and values is being modi fied to handle the new circumstances. The old ideology is no longer adequate and the wave of the future is the new set shaping up. The impli cation here is that anyone who is not an anti quarian, anyone who wants to be where the action is, will point his nose in the direction of this future and get with it. There is much to be learned from this kind of developmental analysis and comparison provided that somewhere along the way questions of truth and obligation are treated. But in the total absence of these con siderations this approach reads like a fashion report. There are even some pious references to the moral, accompanied by the use of moral lan guage (the use of 'responsibility' is a case in point), but until and unless some attempt is made to ground obligation, to step the moral mast, so to speak, the whole concern with cor porate responsibility is at the mercy of the winds. Philosophical ethics might have been ex pected to remedy this, but hasn't done much but confirm the vagaries of wind and current during the last generation. Having shown to its satisfac tion that the 'ought' cannot be grounded on the 'is', it appears that the moral enterprise is adrift. The question "What are the foundations of corporate responsibility?" presupposes yet another question: What would a responsible cor poration be like? How should I think about cor porate structure and activity? Professor James Coleman in his little book Power and the Struc ture of Society tells us "if you want to know what is new in the modern world, it is the modern corporation". (W. W. Norton, 1974, p. 14) How are we to understand this new phenom enon? My answer to these questions is that corporate activity can best be understood on analogy with the activity of persons. Let me start by giving what I take to be three good reasons for taking this thesis seriously and then I want to sketch an answer to the problem of obligation and con sider some of its implications. The first of these reasons is historical and based upon the fact that the legal conception of the corporation was fashioned after the legal conception of the natural person. It has come down to us as the corporate person and is known as a legal fiction. Such corporate persons are understood functionally as having rights and obligations at law analogous to those of natural persons. The fact that the legal idea of the cor poration developed historically along these lines argues at least for the initial plausibility of the suggested analogy. The second reason is that while the corpora tion may have rights and powers as well as duties, these cannot be exercised except by per sons acting as corporate agents. This instru mental function of persons within the corpor ation framework includes not only management but employees as well. In fact, by extension, two other types of persons can be included as effecting corporate activity, the investor and the consumer. In speaking of the 'active wealth' of corporate management, Berle and Means say1 "The group in control of a large modern cor poration is astride an organism which has little real value except as it continues to function [and]... is dependent for [its life] on its security holders, ...workers and consumers, but most of all on [its] mainspring, ? 'control' ". (p. 348) Corporate activity is surrounded by, shot through with and totally dependent upon the activities of persons and this leads to the third and best reason for thinking of corporate activity on analogy with persons. Originally corporations were the instruments of the people who formed them but in their modern development it is the people who have become instruments of corporate purposes. The result has been a widespread loss of freedom by persons. But perhaps more important is the loss of power ? the sense of being reduced to some thing less than a person should be, or even, used to be. The classic example is the consumer with a just complaint looking for satisfaction. Locating someone with responsibility is no easy job. There are exceptions, but very often you get nowhere unless you are willing to make an</page><page sequence="3">Corporate Responsibility 147 occupation of your complaint and a long-term investment of time. The only real defense against being completely reduced is to consider corporations to be like persons, to hold them responsible to ourselves and society in the same way that persons are held responsible to each other and to society in general. Nothing will de humanize our society more completely than to have the most powerful elements in that society treated and thought about in non-human ways. When I first began to study philosophy I remem ber reading that anthropomorphism, the at tributing of human characteristics to non-human things, was unscientific and wrong. This com plaint is at least as old as Zenophanes who, abut 510 B.C., vilified Homer for writing about the gods in that way. And it must be admitted there is some 'right reason' in the complaint. Nonetheless, there are limits and where human creations such as society and its institutions are concerned, a certain bedrock anthropomorphism is positive virtue, in the absence of which, for man, to borrow a phrase, 'nothing beside remains'. There is yet a further reason for taking the proposed analogy seriously in the way we talk about corporations and their activities (the afore mentioned phrase 'corporate responsibility' is a case in point). So far as I know no one tries to show that any kind of finite being other than humans can be responsible and even that is roundly debated every so often. To attribute responsibility to corporations suggests the pro posed analogy, whether correctly or incorrectly. Lastly, consider as example the wording of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor... ." Only persons can 'combine', 'conspire' or even 'be guilty'. A 'caveat' is appropriate before proceeding: I am not saying that a corporation is a person, but only that in certain ways a corporation is like a person, and, since the corporation is a human creation and only persons can be responsible, if we want the corporation to be responsible, we ought to take these ways of being alike very seriously. Prior to the historic study of Berle and Means in 1934, entitled The Modern Corporation and Private Property, it was assumed that the corpo ration was an instrument of its owners and that it would operate within the purposes for which the owners formed it. As long as this instru mental relationship obtained the locus of re sponsibility for corporate action was simply assignable to the owners. But as the separation of ownership from control developes, this tra ditional locus of responsibility evaporates. The result has been likened to a corporate Franken stein monster, having all the power of pooled resources, the ability to perpetuate its own power and no responsibility for its actions beyond what the law covers. The prospects for the misuse of such power are at least as frighten ing for ordinary mortals as was the older and less sophisticated era of the 'robber barons'. There are those who in the face of this situation see nothing but a tight-fisted set of laws for the protection of society. And of course much of the regulation that has come about through the years has been in response to just such a peril. I shall turn to the topic of regulation later on, but want to return at present to the separation of ownership and control for a longer look. Berle and Means point out that when this split comes about the purposes of the managers need no longer be those of the owners (p. 12lff). There is general agreement that corporate objec tives in the post-World War II era have been "survival, growth, profit, economic contribu tions and social obligations" (Luthans and Hodgetts, p. 38).2 Obviously, the order listed is from the most to the least basic. The interesting thing about this list of objectives is how it differs from the objectives of corporations prior to the coming about of the split. As instruments, corporate goals were obviously those of the owners, presumably profits. But with the split between ownership and control something striking comes about which i? implicit in the ob jectives of survival and growth and indicative of an important stage in the development of the corporate idea; with the coming of the split, the corporation clearly becomes an end-in-itself with</page><page sequence="4">148 James B. Wilbur its own objectives. Management acquires a vested interest in the survival of the corporation it controls and the giving of an adequate return on investment to the owners becomes just one of the conditions of survival. And, since nothing stands still, growth is also a condition of survival as well as of increased power for management. Previously, in mentioning the results of the split, it was noted that its occurrence removed the traditional grounds of responsibility, the owners, from the picture leaving a monster on the loose. That is partly true, but there is more to the story. For when the split made the cor poration an end-in-itself, apart from the ends of the owners, it created the basic condition with out which there can be no responsibility whatso ever. The corporation becomes something in its own right. Prior to that point, the courts' con sideration of corporations as persons was an acknowledged fiction. Since then, the basic building block of responsible activity, self-stand ing individuality, has been present. Or put in another way, the courts have developed the idea of the corporation on analogy with the person for several hundred years and in large part this development has occurred in our country over the last one hundred and seventy-five years. As long ago as 1819 in Dartmouth College vs. Woodward, Chief Justice Marshall, referring to the 'artificial being' of the Corporation, wrote of the properties of such being, Among the most important are immortality, and if the expression may be allowed, individuality; proper ties by which a perpetual succession of many persons are considered as the same, and may act as a single in dividual. They enable a corporation to manage its own affairs... .3 But it wasn't until the split between ownership and control came about that the independent status which is a precondition of personhood came into existence. (The parallel between the corporation and the nation state in this light is compelling and the corporation has been charac terized, especially in its multinational form, as being like a nation state in its independence. But this goes beyond present concern.) There is a further point to be made concern ing the split however. The classical tradition in economics holds firmly to the view that the primary objective of the corporation should be the maximization of profits. For an instrument of the owner's purpose, maximization of profit must mean one thing, the fulfillment of the owner's purpose, presumably profits. But for an end-in-itself, maximization of profits takes on a wholly different meaning; at best profit be comes a means to the goals of survival and growth. To put it in language which I will use a little later on, as instrument, corporate activity is purely acquisitive. As end-in-itself, however, corporate activity aims first at satisfying those demands which must be met to maintain itself. The concern for profit is very different before and after. The former is analogous to pure egoism in human behavior while the latter in volves not only self-regarding but other-regard ing motives as well. As has been suggested, the latter "makes 'profit' more than an economic concept". It is one thing to point out that with the split the corporation becomes an end-in-itself, an in dividual, but the problem of responsibility re mains. John Maurice Clark in The Ethical Basis Of Economic Freedom (Westport, Ct., The Kazanjian Economics Foundation, Inc. 1955) poses the problem as follows: To talk of the business corporation as facing a 'crisis of legitimacy' does not imply that there exists any significant controversy as to whether it should exist; there is none. Rather it is to suggest that corporate leaders are being confronted with two basic ques tions: By what right do you who manage these huge corporations exercise your power? And what means do we have to insure that corporate power will be exercised in accord with some generally accepted notion of the public interest? (pp. 128?9) Clark expresses the matter in terms of the dis tinction between 'public' and 'private' and looks for some assurance that corporations will be concerned with the former and not merely the latter interest. In traditional moral terms this is the problem of egoism and altruism in the field of human motivation and behavior and it is the nub of the notion of obligation. The ground for the analogy between corpora tions and persons lies in the conception of</page><page sequence="5">Corporate Responsibility 149 activity which is common to both. Responsibil ity has to do with the activity of persons and it is the activity of corporations which needs to be made responsible. The best analysis* of activity that I am aware of appears in a little book by Alburey Castell entitled The Self in Philosophy 4 and occurs in the context of distinguishing activity from process. In the exposition that follows, the ideas are Castell's and my summary explication of them aims at a faithful rendering though I may miss the mark. But the uses to which they are put are upon my own head. Castell begins by considering astronomy, the science which studies the nature and movements of the solar system. Such solar movement is a process. Astronomizing, on the other hand, is the discipline which studies the nature and movements of the solar system. Such a discipline is an activity and the following characteristics belong to activity but not to process. Activity is fallible, purposive, experimental, critical (per formed by reference to criteria), reasoned (asks for justification), a locus for choice, a locus for responsibility, corrigible, meaningful, judgmen tal, presuppositioned, requires the distinction between real and ideal, educable, and involves response to challenge.5 Clearly some of these presuppose or involve others but before enter ing into such comparisons to flesh out the nature of activity, we must follow Castell's argu ment one step further. For Castell, it seems true beyond question that there are activities, and I tend to agree, because the denial of activity is itself an activity.6 Notice, this is not a proof of activity, it merely cuts the ground from under the opposition in the same way the skeptic is silenced (what C. I. Lewis called a "pragmatic contradiction").7 While all of those characteristics listed above are important in that they reveal the differing aspects of activity some of them mark out the outlines more clearly than others. Such, for example, is 'purposiveness' ? all activity is directed towards some end. (We will speak of 'purposive activity' throughout this paper just to keep this characteristic of activity in front of us.) Further, purposive activity is 'critical' in that certain criteria are used to assess progress towards the goal. Perhaps the most important characteristic of activity is that it has 'presup positions' ? that is, there are certain conditions which must be the case or the activity in question is not possible. As an example, consider the so called three laws of thought: Identity, Non contradiction and the Excluded Middle, if you reflect upon the activity of thinking you will see that there can be no thinking ? dreaming or fantasy perhaps ? but no thinking unless these laws are adhered to. Thinking presupposes them. It is perhaps not as informative to say that these laws are true for all thought as to say that these laws are normative for all thinking. C. I. Lewis observed that they constitute "the morality of thought".8 Being a 'locus of choice' is another charac teristic of purposive activity ? if I cannot choose which measures will further my purpose and ignore those that do not, there can be no purposive activity. Freedom of choice, then is a presupposition of purposive activity. Notice, this is not a proof of freedom, there can be none. But for me to be able to do what I'm doing in writing this paper it is necessary that I be free to choose. There are other presuppositions of purposive activity ? conditions necessary for it to come about. Since purposive activity involves some one doing something in some context, there are two groups of necessary conditions, those per taining to the agent and those pertaining to the context or world of the agent. We have already seen that 'freedom' pertains to the agent, but since freedom would amount to nothing unless there were real alternatives, the world of the agent must contain real 'multiplicity'. In sum mary fashion, the other two conditions per taining to the world are 'continuity', ? in a world of atomistic states the perdurance of directed effort would not be possible, and 'struc ture', ? unless there were stable connections between the things of the world no goal could ever be attained and you couldn't go about getting somewhere from anywhere else. The other two conditions pertaining to the agent are 'concern', ? an agent must be able to exhibit continuous concern to carry out purposive activity, and 'consistency', ? an agent must act</page><page sequence="6">150 James B. Wilbur in a stable and connected manner, that is, not in a willy-nilly sort of way and not in such a way as to cut the ground from under his previous actions. By far the most important of these pre suppositions of purposive activity are 'freedom' and 'multiplicity' for with them come the possi bility of choosing wrongly as well as rightly. But notice, there are two senses of choosing rightly or wrongly here. In one sense, with reference to fulfilling ones purpose, choice may be right or wrong. But in another sense, choice may be right or wrong as it either maintains or cuts the ground from under the very possibility of pur posive activity itself. It will have become clear at this point that I am on the edge of an interpretation of the Kantian ethic. I wish to acknowledge this and to say something about why it is important to our topic. The problem of the legitimacy of corporate power raised by the separation of ownership and control is not a new problem. Rather, it is a species of a very familiar problem in the modern world. In the so-called Modern Period in Western European Civilization it is almost a truism to say that the basic interest has been with the individuality of man. This, of course, translates directly into the importance of freedom and is expressed in the Protestant Reformation as well as the political theory of the state. The difficul ty has been to square authority and obligation with the fact of freedom so as not to undercut the integrity and independence of the individual. This is not easy to do as a moment's reflection will show. Of all the theories of political and social orga nization put forward in the last four hundred years to answer this difficulty only that of Kant sets out to locate the source of authority and obligation within the individual himself. This means that for Kant the individual is ultimate in ways which I will make clear and which bear, I believe, very heavily upon our problem of cor porate responsibility and the worth of the analogy between corporations and persons suggested in this paper. As I was saying, freedom to choose makes attaining your goal possible, but it also means you can undercut the possibility of your own activity ? i.e., you can vote away your right to vote. It is one thing when external conditions remove the possibility of purposive activity, but it is quite another when you by your action undercut those possibilities for yourself. Just as the laws of thought are normative for that special kind of purposive activity called thinking, so there are similar conditions which are nor mative, obligatory for purposive activity in general. It is the maintenance of these con ditions of purposive activity which is constitutive of responsible personhood. Each of qs discovers these by reflection upon those conditions without which purposive activity would be im possible. It is this capacity in each of us to carry out purposive activity, and, by reflecting upon such activity while engaged in it, to recog nize the enabling conditions of it as obligatory, that constitutes the moral dimension of human nature. Kant calls this capacity 'practical reason' and characterizes its enabling conditions as 'categorical' and unconditionally imperative. This doesn't mean that you must do something, you have the power of choice, but it does mean that you ought to do something on pain of undercutting your own nature as a responsible person, if you don't. One of Kant's examples: it is wrong to lie because if everyone could lie there would be no truth and lying would lose its meaning. This is generalized as "act so that the principle of your action can be universalized without self-contradiction", and called the Categorical Imperative. In contemporary ethical theory this is the criterion of universalizability, nothing is right for me unless it would be right for everyone, and captures very well the usual moral meaning of the term 'right'. But the con nection between lying and purposive activity can best be seen if we take universalization to apply only to my own behavior. It would be right for me to lie in this instance only if it would be right for me to lie in every instance, to be a consistent and concerned liar.9 If you had to lie all the time, you couldn't do anything, nothing would have any meaning and purposive activity would be impossible. I do not believe that the criterion of univer salizability relies so much upon an act being</page><page sequence="7">Corporate Responsibility 151 right for me only if right for all others ? which would place the criterion of obligation outside of the individual ? as much as it relies upon the traditional notion that the essential attributes of a thing are those which are always present when ever the thing in question is present ? that is, lying can only be moral, an essential, rather than an accidental, part of the moral, if it can be present in or consistent with all instances of the moral, in this case, with the dimension of pur posive activity. Of course, lying makes utter nonsense of this dimension, and each individual upon reflection can see this for himself. The considerations just mentioned lead to one of the most important and I think striking aspects of this view of individual responsibility. The conditions which maintain the possibility for me to be responsible are the conditions which maintain that possibility for all persons. The best example I can give of this idea comes from an understanding of the slogan 'Support Your Better Business Bureau' and the realization of how best this can be done. It is widely recog nized that the best way to give such support is to conduct your business affairs in an honest manner because by so doing you establish a climate in which other businesses and your own can do likewise. In short, the conditions which best support you in your purposive corporate activity are the ones which best support all purposive corporate activity. We are all involved in maintaining the conditions of personal re sponsibility for ourselves as well as for others. It would seem that this is the primary and sup portive relationship of society to its members and of the members to each other and to them selves. Off hand, I can think of no duties found ed on other grounds than these. There are those who would found corporate responsibility upon a contractual agreement be tween the corporation and the community, but reflection upon what such a contract presup poses on the part of the parties to it, will, I be lieve, lead us back to the foundations we have just been considering. There are a number of very fine books on the corporate problem whose authors at the outset deny the adequacy of treating the corporation as a person in the manner of the law. They often hold that such a way of looking at corporate enterprise may have been useful and meaningful in earlier conditions of our history, but that such is no longer the case. And then they pro ceed very carefully to suggest ways and means of making corporate activity more critical, more re flective, more broadly concerned and purposive, in a word, more responsible in exactly the func tional and organic ways that have been suggested here. Such proposals as upgrading and standard izing the corporate charter, giving the responsi bility of the board of directors an active and critical dimension and many others, all of which suggest nothing so much as the characteristics of the purposive activity of responsible persons sketched previously. To say that the corporation is like a person is not the anatomical comparison so dear to the middle ages and the early modern era with the monarch as the head of the body politic nor even of the military with the cavalry as the eyes and ears of the army. Rather, it is a thoroughly functional analogy, a self-conscious, reflective and purposive way of acting, and to my mind it is like nothing so much as the pur posive activity of responsible persons. It is often pointed out that there has been an organization al, and managerial revolution in the last forty years and much of it is organic in nature and functional in aim in just this way. Professor James Coleman in comparing the purposes established in the corporate charter under which the corporation must act with the motives of persons makes the excellent point that the purposes of a corporation are so much more simple and monolythic than the complex of motives and sensibilities of the average person that they tend to dominate and cancel out the interests of natural persons in our community.10 It would seem that in our present era of concern with ecological, consumer and equal rights we are watching the upgrading of corporate sensibil ity and motivation to a level more nearly com mensurate witt the complex sensibilities needed by responsible persons. So far I have presented a conception of activity which is purposive, reflective, and pre suppositioned. I have been concerned primarily with the latter characteristics, the presupposi tions of activity, as the locus of obligation and</page><page sequence="8">152 James B. Wilbur the source of responsibility and have called this aspect the maintenance dimension of activity. Freedom of choice brings about concern with moral matters of maintenance. And in the light of this, purposive activity is seen to be double ended. No matter to what external end activity may be directed, there are inner conditions of activity itself which must be maintained. This requirement is best expressed in Kant's Third formulation of the categorical imperative: "act so as to treat humanity, both in your own per son and in that of another as an end and never as a means only". With respect to our treatment of others and ourselves this statement very near ly says it all. While this inner purposiveness or maintenance function is neither derived from nor dependent upon the external ends of activity, the obliga tion to be concerned with the acquisitive or ex ternal dimension stems from the maintenance function and is categorical.11 Man is not indepen dent, he has needs and these ought to be taken into account and purposive activity is goal orient ed. Then too, there are forces outside as well as inside us which can effect our activity for good or evil and constitute opportunity or peril. It is here that the whole utilitarian, cost-benefit form of analysis in terms of consequences comes in but within the framework of the moral concern with maintenance. The concern is categorical but assessments of individual ends and their con sequences within that concern, are complex, chancy, and very often endlessly arguable. While each individual matter of prudence is not cate gorically obligatory, the general concern with prudence as such is one of the presuppositions of purposive activity and the maintenance dimen sion. It is on these grounds for example, that a corporation moving into a new community should take seriously the concerns of that com munity even though their own line of business may be unrelated. And it is in these terms that the myriad possible ends that present themselves for choice are assessed both in their expected consequences and in the light of the presupposi tions of purpose activity "both in your own per son and in that of another", and accepted or re jected. It is against the moral backdrop of the maintenance dimension of purposive activity that contracts involving the interests of the par ties to them can be entered into in good faith. And it is against this dimension that the general rights and duties of persons whether stockholders, employees, consumers or the corporate entities themselves can be legitimately marked out. In the rest of this paper I want to be con cerned with the topic of regulation as it relates to the analogy suggested and the ideas set forth. As might be expected from the historical com ments made earlier, it is the topic of regulation which poses the severest challenge to the analogy we are considering. To repeat the question in the quote above from John Maurice Clark, "...what means do we have to insure that corporate power will be exercised in accord with some generally accepted notion of the public interest?" It is clear that there are only three avenues of approach to this problem of regulation: the cor porate charter, the persons who carry on the corporation's business and the community it self. The corporate charter could go a long way to wards insuring responsible behavior and could very well specify certain general conditions of activity as well as the external goals of the ac tivity. But the present chartering by state on a competitive basis gives little hope for the up grading and standardizing of charters. However, closely akin to charter provisions are the by-laws and operating policies which corporations estab lish for themselves. This is a very important source of improvement because it is almost a rule of thumb that if a corporation doesn't take steps to control its own operations, it is inviting outside regulation. The commonest complaint of the corporate community against regulation is that it robs them of the freedom of decision needed to carry on business properly. There is an extremely significant truth here; regulation deprives them of their ability to act responsibly. It can, but need it do so? The very heart of responsible activity is the phenomenon of self-regulation; such activity is 'critical', that is, it is performed with reference to standards for guiding choice. In bringing up our children we cannot produce responsible behavior without extending them the freedom to exercise such critical choice. Ham-handed</page><page sequence="9">Corporate Responsibility 153 regulation of our children's behavior can pre clude the possibility of their ever being really responsible. This is no apology for a standard less permissiveness, just the recognition that in matters of regulation the community can throw the baby out with the bath water. The power to regulate is the power to destroy and we must regulate so as to allow the freedom and auton omy needed for responsible activity. And this is where the shoe pinches, for the very possibility of responsible action by any person includes the possibility of irresponsible action, the moral includes the immoral within it as possibility. Considering the power and influence which cor porations exert upon society this is not a prospect to be viewed lightly. And yet I see no complete remedy from the outside for this risk without slowly but surely reducing the areas in which purposive activity as spoken of here will even be possible. Again, this is not an apology for corporate freedom. Much regulation, enabling as well as restricting and prohibiting, is both pos sible and desirable, but the capacity to be an end-in-itself must not be removed or else the conditions of purposive activity by responsible persons will be severely crippled in our society. It is for this reason that many business firms are trying to be self-governing and set standards of their own. There are different levels or kinds of regulation and we should look at them briefly in the light of our analogy. The surest way of regulating the flow of traf fic across the front yard is to fence it in. If the threat is from small children, unruly mobs or any and all free-wandering animals, you may have to do just that. However, if the threat is from the comings and goings of individual people in daily commerce, signs saying 'Keep off the Grass' located strategically may well do the job. But notice, this form of regulation presup poses something about the regulated other than the capacity to move around. It requires the ability to read and understand the sign as well as the capacity to see the meaning as applying to the person reading the sign, 'this means me', and the ability to direct my movements in conformi ty with the message. This type of regulation, simple as it is, requires purposive activity on the part of the regulated to carry it out. The very same assumptions are in force with laws and regulations, except that the problem is more difficult. Because the conditions stipulated in laws and regulations are general in nature and because those being regulated are always in some particular situation a judgment must be made that this situation comes under this regulation and not some other and this requires choice and critical activity. As mentioned before, you can regulate by requiring that certain things be taken into account (pollution) or not be taken into account (race, color or creed) in the decision process and the ensuing activities. This narrows the available options, puts uninteresting conse quences behind non-compliance and sharpens the sensibilities of those involved. And as long as such regulation doesn't get on the other side of what are 'reasonable' operating conditions in a given industry, regulation and responsibility can go hand in hand. The relationship of govern ment regulatory agencies and the industries they regulate is much in the public eye at the mo ment and rightly so. You can put the question another way: Is the public interest so narrow and confining that there is no room within it for private interest? And we have that peculiar combination of busi ness and government, the private-public corpora tion, which draws its initiative and techniques from the private sector and its accountability procedures from the public. Or perhaps one of the most important public interests is exactly the preservation of the enabling conditions of private interest? It is perhaps worth noting in passing that that is the main function of a bill of rights, a public document grounding the rights and duties of each. The degree to which this latter question is answered in the affirmative is the degree to which the problem of regulation has a large dimension of education within it. We often think we lay down the conditions for respon sible activity by just leaving the room needed for such activity and we are often tragically dis appointed by our children, by our cities, where the pressures against civilized behavior increase daily, and even by our government. We are learning however, that we have to get inside the decision activity with our corporations not to</page><page sequence="10">154 James B. Wilbur dictate restrictions so much as to instill sensi tivity to the awareness of the basic values and conditions that permit responsibility and the freedom that goes with it for everyone. By way of summary, the common ground for the analogy between corporations and persons lies in the nature of activity and activity is the only basis for responsibility. Activity is distin guished from process in that it is, among other things, purposive, critical, involves choice and has presuppositions. Reflection upon activity reveals its double-endedness ? it aims to acquire some thing or condition extrinsic to it while maintaining itself in so doing. Hence, there are external conditions of purposive activity as well as internal conditions. The external conditions are multiplicity, continuity and structure. The internal conditions are freedom, concern and consistency, and these latter three are normative for purposive activity in that they embody the conditions without which there would be no purposive activity and no responsibility. And be cause these are the general conditions of all pur posive and responsible activity and not just my own, they constitute the moral dimension for man. I have been laying out the conditions of the class of purposive activities, have pointed out the presuppositions which are normative for this class and have taken membership in this class as the locus of responsibility. But the question re mains: What makes the conditions of the class of purposive activities obligatory and necessary for the individual? Such obligation would im pinge only upon members of the class and could be considered as only hypothetical and not cate gorical for each or any individual. But in so far as human beings carry on purposive activity, and a good case can be made that such activity is descriptive of the peculiarly human, these norms apply to what humans do, and the obligation can be seen to apply to anyone so engaged by reflection upon the conditions of his own engage ment. I doubt that I can fail to be purposive in my behavior and still remain responsibly human, and I recognize this responsibility as applying to all members of the class, including myself. But each individual must recognize this for him self.12 In conclusion it could be argued that the de velopment of the corporate idea and structure has increasingly taken on the character of per sons. Since they are conceived by, activated by and reflect the purposes of persons, it would be unlikely that they should do otherwise. And this tendency has increased in the face of the mount ing need and pressure to make corporate activity responsible. The continued upgrading of their reflective and critical awareness of the condi tions of their own purposive activity as being the conditions for any such purposive activity will strengthen the comparison. Only in this way can the difficult combination of individual initiative and choice and the awareness and sensitivity to the enabling conditions of the human and the corporate community and the values they reflect be brought about. Who knows, under the con tinuing pressure of the general community and with an increased awareness of the norms to be taken seriously backed by sanctions where need ed, corporate purposive activity might wind up among the most responsible activities in the community of persons. Considering the power it possesses for good and evil, it needs to be. Only in this way can corporations be good to work for and to live with.
