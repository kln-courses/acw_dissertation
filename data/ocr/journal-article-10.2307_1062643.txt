The odes from The Interpreter of Desires are written in formal prosody and follow many of the classical Arabic poetic conventions. Ibn 'Arabi's own commentary on The Inter- preter of Desires is written in an expository prose and can be translated as such. The majority of his works, however, are written in a style that falls somewhere between prose and verse. This style does not contain the meters, rhymes, and topoi of the classical poetry. However, it is often filled with stylistic effects such as rhymed prose, interior rhythms, and assonance. In addition, it follows in no way the syntactical and argumentative rules which make up modern prose. Thus it cannot be fitted into ? 1984 by The University of Chicago.

Before taking up this theory, some words about my approach are needed. Though Ibn 'Arab! is acknowledged in Sufi circles as the grand master (al-shaykh al-akbar) of Islamic mystical thought, he has sentence and paragraph structures without doing violence to both its intent and the forms into which it is being forced. An excellent solution to this problem was accomplished by Toshihiko Izutsu in A Comparative Study of the Key Philosophical Concepts in Sufism and Taoism, 2 vols. (Tokyo: Keio Institute, 1966), the first volume of which is a comprehensive study of Ibn 'Arabi's thought. His study contains a large selection of Ibn 'Arabi's texts in translation. In order to fit the original style into periods and paragraphs, Izutsu makes constant use of interpolations, filling in the ellipses and the logical steps that are missing in the original. I have used the opposite method, a free verse system which attempts to follow exactly the original syntactical and logical rhythms and to reproduce faithfully what I call the "hot discourse" of the original (as opposed to the coolness of systematic argumentation). I emphasize that these verse forms are not an attempt to decorate the original. Rather, they are an attempt to reproduce it as faithfully as possible. Since I have translated both the formal verses and the "prose" of Ibn 'Arab! into English verse form, I have used italics to indicate translations of formal Arabic poetry. 2 These verses were cited and made popular by Reynold Nicholson on the first page of his edition and translation of Tarjuman, with the comment that "they express the Sufi doctrine that all ways lead to the One God": Ibn al-'Arabi, The Tarjuman al- Ashwdq: A Collection of Mystical Odes, trans. and ed. Reynold Nicholson (London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1911), p. iii. Nicholson cites the same verses in The Mystics of Islam ([1914; reprint, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963, 1979], p. 105), with the comment that "love is the essence of all creeds: the true mystic finds it whatever guise it may assume." Henry Corbin cites them as a conclusion to his treatment of the Sufis as "fedeli d'amore" seeking union with Sophia, "the figure of wisdom": Henry Corbin, Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'ArabT, trans. Ralph Manheim (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1969), p. 135. They are also cited, with brief remarks similar to those of Nicholson, in the following works: Ignaz Goldziher, An Introduc- tion to Islamic Theology and Law, trans. Andras Hamori (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1981), p. 152, which originally appeared as Vorlesungen uiber den Islam (Heidelberg, 1910); Reynold Nicholson, Translations of Eastern Poetry and Prose (London: Cambridge University Press, 1922), p. 148; Idries Shah, The Sufis (New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1964), p. 145; Seyyed Hussein Nasr, Three Muslim Sages: Avicenna, Suhraward7, and Ibn cArabT (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964), p. 118; Margaret Smith, Readings from the Mystics of Islam (London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1972), p. 97; Nasrallah, Faramarz, and Fariborz Fatemi, Sufism (New York: A.

With the exception of Nasr, none of these writers discuss the verses within the wider context of Ibn 'Arabl's thought, and I have found no treatment of them which links them to a full discussion of the theory of the heart that is receptive of every form. 3 Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1975), p. 272, and As through a Veil: Mystical Poetry in Islam (New York: Columbia University Press, 1982), p. 39.

Perhaps the most important reason for this is the eclectic nature of his subject matter, which includes (to name only a few large areas): pre-Islamic and post-Islamic poetic themes, folk Islam, Islamic and Greek metaphysics, scholastic theology (kalaim), Hellenistic and post- Hellenistic Hermetic sciences (astrology, alchemy, and magic), Gnosti- cism, Shi'ism, Islamic law, and of course Sufi thought. The various systems permeate and interpenetrate one another in synchretistic fusion throughout the utterly immense corpus of his writings.4 Or one might say, conversely, that his writings consist of a single set of hermeneutical and philosophical principles manifesting them- selves in widely eclectic contexts, or "substrata." In each new context the basic principles take on a new hue, clothe themselves in a new vocabulary, and function in a slightly different manner. As in a continually turning kaleidoscope, the configuration changes before we can adequately take it in. Although the various contexts are not systematized in a linear fashion, they are integrated dynamically. Often a given passage will play on several systems simultaneously through the use of terminological polyvalence. Or several themes will be developed concurrently in a fuguelike movement. No particular expression or manifestation of the central principles is self-sufficient or transparent. Each new passage reveals something and veils something. There is always an obscurity, an undefined term, a new paradox. On a positive level each passage is the expression of a principle. From the negative perspective it is the expression of an aporia. We are led from passage to passage, from one difficulty into deeper difficulties. It is the moving image rather than any particular frame that is significant. Finally, it is impossible to separate what is being said from how it is said and thus impossible to paraphrase faithfully the text (unless one's paraphrase were so modified and qualified that it ended up recreating the original). The beauty of this mode of discourse is that it reflects dynamically the very principles Ibn 'Arabi wishes to elucidate. The difficulty is that we are not able to remove the principles from their contexts without betraying them. And the alternative to such betrayal is a plunge into a vast ocean of eclectic thought systems and into the serpentine currents of the grand master's style. 4 Over two hundred works are attributed to him, one of which, Al-Futuihat al- Makkiv,a, will include more than twenty volumes in its new edition.

I begin with a summary of the theory in question and the general world view of which it is part. The summary is provisional, meant only to introduce the terms and sketch the field in which they function. There follows a fuller exposition of the theory, centered on selected citations from Ibn 'ArabT. The aim is twofold: to allow the reader to engage the text directly and to present along with it a set of critical categories which will reflect and reveal its inner dynamic. The essay concludes with a brief reevaluation of the thought of Ibn 'Arabi from the perspective of the theory of the heart that is receptive of every form. BINDING OF THE INTELLECT, TRANSFORMATION OF THE HEART The immediate context of the theory is the Sufi critique of rational- ism. The Islamic philosophers had associated knowledge ('ilm) with the intellect ('aql) and maintained that the way to knowledge was the way of rational speculation (nazar). The scholastic theologians (mutakallimin) developed a rational discourse (kalam) through which they attempted to solve the major problems of Qur'anic interpreta- tion and Islamic belief.5 In contrast, the Sufis pointed to the heart (qalb) as the seat and faculty of ma'rifa (mystical knowledge or understanding). Though Muhyl al-DTn's theory is partially rooted in the often polemical controversy among the various modes of Islamic thought, it extends far beyond these original bounds. For Ibn 'Arabi, al-haqq (the Truth)6 manifests itself to itself through every form or image but 5 Muhyi al-DTn both admired Islamic philosophy for its brilliance and criticized it for what he believed were its limitations and pretensions. This complex attitude is vividly displayed in the Sufi master's accounts of his meetings with Ibn Rushd (Averroes). The two failed to come to a meeting of the minds because they had radically different notions of "where" and what mind, in the sense of seat and faculty of true understanding, was. The anecdotes appear in Ibn 'Arabi, Al-Futuihat al-Makkiyya [Meccan revelations], ed. 'Uthman Yahya and Ibrahim Madhkur (Cairo: Al-Hay'a al-Masriyya al-'Ama li al-Kitab, 1972-), 2:372-73, and in the older edition: Al- Futahat al-Makkiyya, 4 vols. (Bulaq: Dar al-Kutub al-'Arabiyya al-Kubra, 1911), 1:153. The stories are recounted in Corbin and in Ralph Austin's introduction to Ibn 'Arabi, Bezels of Wisdom [Fusiis al-Hikam], trans. Ralph Austin (New York: Paulist Press, 1980), pp. 2-3. For a clear introduction to the mutakallimin (scholastic theolo- gians) and their method of kaldm (rational argumentation), see Goldziher. Though some of Goldziher's judgments have become controversial, the controversies are usually noted by the modern editor, Bernard Lewis, and the footnotes and bibliography have been updated. 6 Al-haqq has been translated as "the Reality" (Austin) and "the Absolute" (Izutsu), both of whom break with the older tradition of translating the term as "God." Because I am emphasizing epistemological issues I have translated it here as "the Truth," though this term has the disadvantage of implying that al-haqq is a pure abstraction, which it is not. At times the words "truth" or "reality" seem more appropriate, and the use of the definite article involves complicated philosophical questions, as well as 290</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions is confined to none. The forms of its manifestation are constantly changing. Through an etymological play, he relates the intellect ('aql, root meaning, rope) to definition, the "binding" (taqyTd) of the Truth into fixed and limited categories or forms. Such a function is epistemically necessary since the purely indeterminate cannot be known or manifest. However, a fundamental error arises when the partial categories or individual forms are taken as fixed and total. This error leads to a world of conflicting beliefs, each of which denies the other. And it leads to an individual's fixation on a particular viewpoint, conception, or experience. In either case, the error is serious, since a belief which denies all other beliefs denies the common root of them all, and an individual who is not in a state of constant change can no longer be said to know and reflect the constantly changing manifestations of the Truth. Thus Ibn 'Arabi's critique of the intellectual error of binding goes beyond a criticism of rationalist philosophy and dogmatic scholasticism and extends to any context in which a form or image (sura) of the Truth appears: religious, scientific, aesthetic, or even mystical. The Sufis themselves are guilty of binding when they stop at a particular station or experience, no matter how exalted, and bind the Truth to it. Through binding, meaning, by nature polyvalent and dynamic, is hidden behind the husks of fixed forms that the Truth has long since shed. This critique of binding is based on a specific view of human nature and its function in the cosmos: as the microcosm on whose form the universe is based, as the prism through which the undifferentiated divine light is refracted into its various forms and attributes, and as the faculty of perception through which reality discloses its forms and attributes to itself. This archetypal human function is personified in the notion of the "complete human being" (al-insain al-kiimil). Muhyl al-Din's interpretation of the Qur'anic story of Adam's creation provides an introductory look at the notion of the complete human being and how that notion grounds the critique of rationalistic binding and the call for a heart that is receptive of every form. In the Qur'anic account of the creation, when Allah informs the angels that he will place a regent (khalTfa) on earth, the angels reply: "Will you place there one who will corrupt it and shed blood while we count your praises and affirm your Transcendence?" Allah answers grammatical issues. "The Ultimate" might make a good modern translation, though I believe this term tends to emphasize the transcendent aspect over the immanent, at least in many discussions. "God" is the least satisfactory solution because it neglects the complex set of distinctions within Ibn 'ArabT's notion of divinity (the divine as creator, as source of emanation, as ground of knowledge, as beyond even the distinction divine/nondivine, etc.). 291</page><page sequence="6">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames this objection by teaching Adam "the names." When the angels admit their ignorance of these names. they are made to prostrate themselves before Adam (Qur'an 2:30-33). Ibn 'Arabi interprets "the names" as the "divine names" (al-asma' al-ilahiyya) and uses the Adam story to illustrate his position on the divine attributes, a central issue in the history of Qur'anic interpretation.7 For Ibn 'ArabT, all divine attri- butes and predications (seeing, knowing, willing, speaking, etc.) are actualized through Adam in his archetypal role as the complete human being. The angels lack the universality of Adam. Each angel represents a certain divine aspect, but only Adam contains all the names. In their objection to the creation of Adam, the angels commit a double error of binding: they reveal their own limitation, each to a particular aspect, and they would also bind the Truth into a "high" station. To affirm the high without knowing the low is also a binding: true affirmation of the high is a function of human nature which knows both sides of the polarity.8 This theory of divinity, humanity, and divine-human attributes is vividly illustrated in Ibn 'Arabl's myth, "the Breath of the Merciful" (nafas al-rahmin), a myth based on the Qur'anic reference to Allah's breathing into Adam in order to bring him to life (Qur'an 21:91). According to this myth, the Truth was in an undifferentiated state before the creation of Adam. The divine names were in a state of nonrealization or tension: they were the keys to a treasure house without a treasure house. The breath (nafas) of the Merciful (the comprehensive divine name) relieved this tension by bringing Adam, the microcosm, to life and thus bringing all the divine names into actuality. The world is a mirror in which the Truth sees itself reflected in its various divine names. Adam is the polishing of the mirror (jala', a verbal play on tajalli, manifestation), the pupil of the eye of the Truth, its medium of perception (a play on the two meanings of insan, pupil of the eye and human being), and the divine imprint on 7 See Goldziher, pp. 92-114, for a brief but clear exposition of how the general problem of attributes split into controversies over the unity of God, the problem of anthropomorphism, and the question of the createdness of the Qur'an, among the various schools of mutakallimiin. The problem of attributes and attribution to the divine is so central in Islamic philosophy (e.g., al-FarabT, Al-MadTnat al-Fddila [The virtuous city], where it is the question on which the entire philosophy is based) that it would be difficult to find a single account which would do it justice. The same can be said of the question as it appears in Sufi thought, usually in treatment of the divine names. 8 Ibn 'Arab!, Fusius al-Hikam, ed. A. A. Afifi, 2 vols. (Cairo: Dar Ihya al-Kutub al-'Arabiyya, 1946), 1:50-51; hereafter cited as Fusus.

Each represents a different mode of human universality (though some fail to realize-in both senses of "understand" and "make real"-the mode of universality they represent). And each partakes of the divine-human dialectic of reciprocity within which the universal consciousness of the complete human being is actualized.10 The theory of the heart that is receptive of every form is repre- sented by the prophet Shu'ayb and, in a negative manner, by Noah. As opposed to the analytic function of the intellect which differenti- ates the Truth into limited, fixed forms, the heart's function is synthetic, or rather it is dynamically integrative. The heart that is receptive of every form is in a state of perpetual transformation (taqallub, a play on the two meanings of the root q-l-b, heart and change). The heart molds itself to, receives, and becomes each form of the perpetually changing forms in which the Truth reveals itself to itself. In each moment the possessor of such a heart encounters a new form of manifestation (tajallT, manifestation, unveiling), and by accepting each form as a manifestation of the Truth unveils these 9 One of the fuller accounts of the myth occurs in Ibn 'Arabi, Inshi' al-Dawa'ir [Construction of the circles], in Kleinere Schriften des Ibn Al-'ArabT, ed. H. S. Nyberg (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1919), pp. 36-38. For Adam as polishing of the mirror, pupil of the eye, and khalTfa, see Ibn 'Arabi, Fusus, 1:48-50. For a translation and discussion, see Michael A. Sells, "The Metaphor and Dialectic of Emanation in Plotinus, John the Scot, Meister Eckhart, and Ibn 'ArabT" (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1982), pp. 205-19. 10 For a good discussion of the complete human being in the thought of Ibn 'Arabi's successors, see William Chittick, "The Perfect Man as the Prototype of the Self in the Sufism of JgmT," Studia Islamica 49 (1979): 135-58. For a full study of Ibn 'Arabi's Fusas, see Izutsu (n. 1 above), vol. 1. It is regrettable that this work is out of print and difficult to find. Such neglect is especially difficult to understand in view of the renewed interest and increased publication in Ibn 'ArabT studies. Joseph and Abraham offer other examples of how the prophets represent the complete human being. Joseph represents the achievement of universality through interpretation, as dream interpreter. Yet even he does not realize the full extent of interpretation. The entire phenomenal world must be interpreted as one interprets a dream, just as history must be so interpreted. Dreams are but dreams within dreams. Abraham, the "intimate friend" (khalTl) of Allah, represents the wisdom of takhallul, mutual interpenetration or mutual nourishment. The divine emanation penetrates and nourishes Abraham (as complete human being) by bestowing on him his existence and by actualizing that existence. Abraham infuses and nourishes the divine with the "names," thus actualizing the divine self-manifestation. Without such mutual interpenetration, the divine remains beyond form and manifestation, and the complete human being remains without existence. 293</page><page sequence="8">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames forms (through kashf, unveiling). Neither tajallT nor kashf can exist by itself. Manifestation occurs only between the two poles. At the moment of this double act, there is a union between the divine and human, between tajalli and kashf, between knower and known. The manifestation is a self-manifestation. The mutually exclusive and fixed forms of binding veil what they should reveal. When the forms are no longer seen as fixed and mutually exclusive, but rather as perpetually changing forms of manifestation, they become transparent and revelatory. Since an individual, by the very nature of individuality, is predisposed to see the Truth in certain forms, to achieve a heart that is receptive of every form requires a continual process of effacement of the individual self in the universal. And since such knowledge involves a union between knower and known, and consequently the effacement of the individual self of the knower in the known, then such a knower is continually being effaced and reconstituted in each new form of manifestation. After this very brief summary, I now turn to Ibn 'ArabT's own presentation of the theory. There is no beginning to his nonlinear discourse. One is always in medias res. Thus, the first citations may seem confusing. However, like one backing away from an impression- ist painting, we should find the picture gradually coming into focus. THE BREATH OF THE MERCIFUL, THE HEART OF THE KNOWER In chapter 12 of Fusus, Muhyl al-Din treats the ancient prophet Shu'ayb as the archetype of the heart that is receptive of every form. At the beginning of the chapter, he asks whether it is the divine mercy (al-rahma al-ilihiyya) or the heart of the mystic knower (al-'arif) which is more encompassing. He first takes one position, then the other, using the rhetorical opposition of two positions as a discursive guise under which the central argument develops. " The term "mercy" (rahma) is technical, a reference to the myth of the Breath of the Merciful mentioned above. The mercy or breath signifies the "dilation" (tanfTs), emanation (fayd), or manifestation (tajallT) through which the divine names are actualized. In the passage below this myth is interwoven with a dialectic. Two aspects of the Truth are distinguished. The first aspect is the Self (al-dhat),'2 unmanifest, undifferentiated, absolute unity. The second 11 Ibn 'Arabl, Fusuis, 1:119-21. For a discussion of the meaning of Allah's "mercy," see Ronald Nettler, "Ibn cArabi's Notion of Allah's Mercy," Israel Oriental Studies 8 (1978): 219-39. 12 Al-dhat can mean essence or self. The dhat of the Truth presents insoluble translation problems; I have used the term "Self" as the least of many evils. "Essence" implies usually a quiddity but the dhdt is beyond quiddity. While using the term "Self," 294</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions aspect is made up of the manifest facets of the Truth: divinity (al- ulihiyya), lordship (al-rububiyya), and the divine names. The divine names, divinity, and lordship are all dependent on a polar comple- ment (e.g., lordship's dependence on the existence of a servant). The Self is beyond all such duality and polarity. The relationship between the two aspects is dialectical: they are radically distinguished from one another, and yet they are said to be the same. The narrative of the myth of the Breath is based on normal, dualistic logic and distinctions (cause-effect, before-after, here-there, etc.). These logical distinctions are subverted by the dialectic. The tension between the myth narrative and the dialectical relationships forms a discourse which I call "mythic dialectic." Allah described himself as breath [nafas] which is from tanfTs [relief] The divine names are the same as that which they name They are nothing but He But they demand the realities which they express And the realities that they demand are nothing other than the world For Divinity requires that over which it is divine and Lordship requires the servant Otherwise they would have no meaning or existence The Truth, in the inner Self, is independent of the worlds But Lordship does not have such independence So the order lies between what Lordship requires and the independence from the world to which the Self holds title But in reality Lordship is the same as the Self it is necessary to distinguish the dhat from the individual ego-self (nafs), from the universal intellectual "Self" of the complete human being, and from the universal "Self" of "intelligible materiality" (the huwiyya, he-ness or it-ness), which offers some interesting similarities to Jung's collective unconscious. The dhat corresponds roughly to the Plotinian One and Eckhart's Godhead (Gottheit), in that it is beyond all dualism, all name, and all quiddity. This comparison is discussed throughout my "Metaphor and Dialectic," esp. pp. 287-90. 295</page><page sequence="10">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames Though when the situation contradicts itself in relations He describes Himself as having compassion on his servants: First he relieved the Lordship with his breath related to the Merciful By creating the world required in its nature by Lordship and by the totality of Divine Names From this perspective his mercy embraces everything including the Truth And is just as encompassing, or more so, than the heart.13 This passage begins and ends with allusions to the myth, allusions in tension with the dialectic introduced in the central section. The dialectic is both complex and oblique. It operates on two planes simultaneously (one might call them vertical and horizontal): between the Self and the outer aspects of the Truth and within the polar dualisms of the outer aspects-between the Self and the divine names and within the name-named (world) dualism, for example. This oblique dialectic is summed up by the statement that "the order lies between" the absolute unity of the Self and the polarity of the manifest aspects. There is a fundamental aporia in any attempt to bring the Self-beyond-relation into a relation: once it has been brought into relation, it is no longer the Self, and a new transcendent Self must be posed, ad infinitum. In a discursive argument such an infinite regress might be considered a fault. Here, it is harnessed within the oblique dialectic, and it will form the central dynamic principle of the succeeding passages. At this point, the focus is shifted from the "breath" to the "heart": 13 Ibn 'Arabi, Fusts, 1:119. I have translated the word 'ayn as "the same" in two places in the above passage. It is clear from the context that this is its primary meaning, and Ibn 'Arabi emphasizes it by placing the words la ill hu ("nothing but He") after it. However, the term is polyvalent in Ibn 'ArabT's thought and can also mean "eye," "source," "essence," or "determination." The latter meaning is most common, and by playing on the equivocation between "same as" and "determination of," the dialectic is invoked internally. The names are the determinations of the Truth, and of the undetermined Self, but they are also "nothing but it." "Though when the situation [of unity] is contradicted by its relations, He describes Himself as having compassion on his servants" (Fusus, 1:119). This "contradiction" functions rhetorically in two ways. It refers to the "tension" in the myth of the names in their nonexistent state, a tension eventually relieved by the "breath" or "sigh." Dialectically, it refers to the tension between the One and its attributes which is then shifted to a new axis of dialectic, that between the Truth and its creation. In this second meaning the Arabic word lamma means "in as much as" rather than the temporal "when." 296</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions Then know that the Truth ( )14 as is confirmed in the tradition transforms itself from form to form in its manifestations And that the Truth ( ) when the heart embraces it- then the heart can embrace nothing else whatsoever- as if it were filled by the Truth Concerning the compass of the mystic knower's heart Abu YazTd al-Bistami said: If the throne and what it contained existed one hundred million times in the heart of the mystic knower he would not be aware of it And Junayd said in the same regard When the originated is related to the eternal no trace remains of the originated When the heart encompasses the eternal how can it feel the existence of the originated?'5 The passage begins with a reference to the perpetual transforma- tion (taqallub) of the Truth. This central notion of Ibn 'ArabT is then related to two classical Sufi notions: the image of the heart being "filled" by the divine emanation and Junayd's doctrine of "passing away" (fana'). Junayd's notion that the Sufi passes away from the individual self during the mystical experience and that only divine consciousness remains (the complementary notion of baqif' or remaining) is used here to effect a perspective shift from the normal world of dualisms to the world of unity. Since the realm of unity cannot be stated directly in language, itself inherently dualistic, it is alluded to through what I have called "monistic method": a statement in dualistic terms (cause and effect, act and being, before and after, subject and predicate, etc.), followed by a fusion of the two terms or 14 The empty parenthesis stands for the word ta'ald which in Ibn 'ArabT cannot be translated since its function is nonreferential. The word is used in Islamic texts whenever the name of Allah or the Truth is used. It is usually translated as "be He exalted" or "He is exalted." In Ibn 'ArabT, however, it is used in a specific dialectical sense and would have to be translated as "Be He exalted above every name, attribute, or action, including the one that I am attributing to Him at this moment out of discursive necessity." The function of ta'ala is similar to the apophatic marker hoion (as it were) used by Plotinus when attributing names or actions to the One. 15 Ibn 'Arabi, Fusus, 1:119-20. Abu YazTd al-Bistami (died ca. 261/874) and Junayd (died 298/910), two influential early Sufis, are considered to represent the inebriate and the sober school of Islamic mysticism, respectively. 297</page><page sequence="12">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames an elimination of one of the terms from the proposition. The method is especially effective when combined, as it is here, with a metaphor such as the vessel-content image. The normal dualism that the image requires is undermined by the perspective shift of "passing away" so that the vessel is the content or, stated otherwise, there is no longer vessel but only content. The combination of perspective shift with metaphor leads to a "metaphoric dialectic,"'6 similar to the mythic dialectic mentioned earlier. The metaphoric dialectic will achieve its greatest dynamism as it is in turn combined with the doctrine of perpetual transformation. The question then arises whether the divine manifestation deter- mines the form that the heart takes or whether the predisposition (isti'dad) of the heart determines the form of the manifestation it receives. Ibn 'Arabi "answers" this question in a new simile: the heart of the knower is like the bezel or setting (fass) of a ring, and the manifestation is like the stone which the setting receives. Ultimately the entire question of whether the heart determines the manifestation or the manifestation, the heart, is "answered" through the perspective shift of fani': in the mystic experience of passing away the very duality of heart and manifestation, vessel and content, setting and stone, is transcended.'7 It would be unfair to accuse our author of evading the problem of determination here. Rather than attempting to solve it, he attempts to deepen its mystery by relating it to the central aporia of the perspective shift (though on the level of surface rhetoric the question is posed as if it could be "solved"). This shift involves a double process: a downward regression to pure receptivity, materia prima, empty vessel, blank mirror, and a com- plementary mystic union in the universal consciousness of the complete human being. When one realizes (in both senses of the term) one's pure receptivity by giving up the ego-self and all its images, one realizes the divine self-reflection. Or conversely, when one realizes the self-reflection, one's ego-self passes away. (The causal relation here is reciprocal.) This perspective shift offanai' in which the one manifest- ing itself (al-mutajallT) becomes (is) the one receiving the manifesta- tion (al-mutajalld lahu) is not described in Ibn 'ArabT's text but rather reenacted through dialectical language as a meaning event.'8 16 For a fuller discussion of monistic method and metaphoric dialectic, see Sells. 17 Ibn 'Arabi, Fusis, 1:120. This is clearly one of the passages on which the title Fusus al-Hikam [Ring settings of wisdom] is based. However, the use of the term is complex, and one is not always sure whether it means the setting or the stone, an ambiguity that seems deliberate. 18 Ibid., p. 121. In a recently completed article, "Ibn 'Arabi's Polished Mirror: Perspective Shift and Meaning Event" (presented to the Middle East Studies Associa- 298</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions Here I wish to emphasize two points. First, the complete human being is not so much an entity or object as an event, the process of perspective shift, offand', the polishing of the divine mirror. Second, individuals cannot hold onto the event, but must continually reenact it. GODS OF BELIEF Ibn 'Arabi goes on in the same passage to state that the "solution" to the problem of the heart and manifestation is that there are in fact two manifestations: the visible manifestation (tajallT al-shahdda) and the paradoxical hidden manifestation (tajallT al-ghayb, literally, mani- festation of the hidden). The visible manifestation corresponds to the particular form or image in which each individual sees the Truth. The hidden manifestation corresponds to the inner reality of the heart which is at once universal and undifferentiated and, at the same time, determines the particularity and individuality of each individual. This hidden manifestation or predisposition is dialectically identical to the visible manifestation it determines (just as the Truth is dialectically identical to the divine names and to each divine name), and it is also identified with the divine huwiyya (self-identity). It is on the relation between the visible manifestation and the hidden that Ibn 'ArabT founds his critique of rationalistic binding and dogmatism, with the visible manifestation corresponding to one's "belief" (i'tiqdd): The Truth which resides in the belief is that whose form the heart encompasses, what reveals itself to the heart to be known The eye sees nothing but the Truth of its belief And there is no secret about the variety of beliefs Whoever binds Him [in a belief] denies Him in any belief other than that in which he has bound Him And affirms Him in the belief in which he bound Him in His manifestation But whoever liberates Him from binding, denies Him not at all But affirms Him in every image into which He transforms Himself He/he gives him/Him of Himself/himself in accordance with the image in which He/he appears to him/Him tion, November 5, 1983, in Chicago, under the title "Ibn 'Arabi: Translation, Inter- pretation, and the Texture of Discourse"), I suggest several modes of interpreting the meaning event and its nondescriptive language. The modes are metaphoric, mimetic, meditative, and existential. 299</page><page sequence="14">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames Infinitely, since the forms of manifestation have no end at which to stop And, likewise, knowledge of Allah has no limit for the knower at which he might stop Rather, the knower asks in every moment for an increase in his knowledge of Him "My lord, increase me in knowledge" [Qur'an 20:116] "My lord, increase me in knowledge" "My lord, increase me in knowledge" So it continues, perpetually, from both sides.'9 The Qur'anic sentence, "My lord, increase me in knowledge," is repeated three times, thus indicating that it is a dhikr (constantly repeated formula of remembrance). In this passage it fulfills two functions simultaneously. It serves discursively to indicate that true knowledge is always in a state of change and increase (and is, ultimately, that very change or increase itself). On the practical level, the dhikr is the chief means whereby the Sufi and, necessarily, the writer and reader of the text attempt to break the spell of binding and achieve perpetual transformation: through the incessant process of reminding, one is able to achieve with each reminder the release from binding and "increase" in knowledge. The critique of binding is based finally on a redefinition of idolatry and infidelity. The individual image that one has of the Truth is the "god" of one's belief. Idolatry is the worship of the god of one's own belief. Infidelity is the denial of the gods of others' beliefs (since by denying these manifestations of the Truth one is denying the Truth itself, which is dialectically identified with each of its manifestations). The point is made indirectly, through a reference to the Qur'anic attack against the polytheists, of whom it is said that at the last judgment they will appeal to their gods, but the gods will not be able to help them: "They have no saviours" (Qur'an 3:22, 56, 91; 16:38; 29:35; 30:29): "In that is a reminder [dhikr] for one who has a heart [qalb]" [Qur'an 50:33] because of its constant transformation in forms and attributes. 19 Ibn 'Arabi, Fusus, 1:121. "He/he gives him/Him of Himself/himself.. .": Muhyi al-Din plays continually on the referential ambiguity of the pronoun huwa and hu to fuse the human and divine referents in the perspective shift. In such cases, it is easiest to show what the pronoun is doing by translating it "He (the Truth)/he (the human being)." I use the male gender for the divine referent only for economy, since the pronoun means both "he" and "it." The question of gender and personality in the Truth is exceedingly complex and eludes any single translation we might choose. 300</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions He did not say "for one who has an intellect" ['aql] For the mind binds [qayyad] and limits the matter in one characterization So it was not a reminder to one who has an intellect And they are the affirmers of a belief Who call one another heretics and infidels Who curse one another "And they have no saviors" The god of one has no authority over the god of the other.20 THE STATION OF NO STATION This view of the monotheist-polytheist controversy of the Qur'an is made more explicit in Ibn 'Arabl's interpretation of the Qur'anic story of Noah (Qur'an 71:21-27). Noah had called the polytheists to the one God, but they stubbornly refused to renounce their gods. Finally, Noah called on his Lord to destroy the idolators lest they lead the people astray. In his commentary on this story, MuhyT al- Din redefines the monotheistic-polytheistic struggle in keeping with the dialectical nature of his thought. Noah had accused the poly- theists of makr (deception, guise), but in reality both parties practiced deception, hiding the true dialectic behind the guise of monotheism and polytheism. Noah and the polytheists each represent one side of the dialectic of transcendence and immanence. Neither side is suffi- cient in itself. Each side by itself is a binding: If you affirm transcendence you bind If you affirm immanence you define If you affirm both you hit the mark You are an Imam in knowledge and a master.21 Noah practiced deception by calling his people to Allah (as if Allah were absent from them, from their beliefs, and from any object in the world, including the wood and stones they worshiped). The poly- theists practiced deception by insisting that their idols were "gods" 20 Ibid., p. 122. "They have no saviours" (ma lahum min nasirTn): in addition to the six places where these exact words occur, there are numerous other references in the Qur'an to the same, very common theme, with slightly different phrasing. 21 Ibid., p. 70. 301</page><page sequence="16">Ibn 'ArabTs Garden among the Flames rather than manifestations of the Truth. It is unclear whether or not Noah and his opponents realized their roles in this complex guise and deception. The mystic knower through the unveiling (kashf) can peel back the surface arguments and reveal (subjectively and objectively) the inner dynamic: You are not He But you are He You see Him in the essence of things Boundless and limited.22 Applying the hermeneutic of kashf, Ibn 'Arabi proceeds to unveil the rest of the story. Noah's accusation that the polytheists lead people astray is actually a reference to the fact that they lead people into mystic perplexity or bewilderment (hayra). Bewilderment is caused by an abandonment of the linear, dualistic logic represented by Noah's calling his people "to" Allah.23 Commenting on Noah's statement, "You [Allah] only increase them in delusion," Ibn 'Arabi says: That is the bewilderment [hayra] of the Muhammadian "Lord, increase me in bewilderment in You..." For the bewildered one has a round [dawr] and a circular motion around the Pole which he never leaves But the master of the long path tends away from what he aims for seeking what he is already in A master of fantasies which are his goal He has a "from" and a "to" and what is between them But the master of the circular movement has no starting point that "from" should take him over and no goal that he should be ruled by "to" He has the more complete existence And is given the totality of the words and wisdoms.24 22 Ibid. 23 Ibid., pp. 71-72. 24 Ibid., p. 73. 302</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions The statment "My lord, increase me in bewilderment in you" is a reformulation of the dhikr seen above, "My lord, increase me in knowledge," which was itself a Qur'anic citation. It also stands on its head the explicitly stated goal of the Islamic philosophers, which was to dispel perplexity or bewilderment (hayra) through rational in- quiry.25 With such intratextual and extratextual allusions in mind, Ibn 'Arabi asserts that the highest knowledge is hayra in the continual transformation from form to form and in the circular motion beyond the dualism of origin and goal. The water and fire in which the polytheists perished is reinterpreted as the universality in which the individual perishes in the experience offanii, with a special ironic twist on the notion of savior: "They did not find any savior besides Allah" Allah was their savior In whom they perished eternally If you had placed them on the shore [of the seas of knowledge-bewilderment], the shore of nature 25 The attempt to dispel hayra or perplexity through a method leading to philo- sophical certainty is the explicitly stated goal of al-Farabi, in his Philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, trans. Muhsin Mahdi (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1962); and Maimonides, in his Guide of the Perplexed [Dalalat al-haVirTn], trans. Shlomo Pines (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), to name only two examples from Islamicate philosophy. Ibn 'Arabi inverses the entire range of philosophical methods. Instead of rationally distinguishing among various manners of argumentation, a distinction al-Farabi believes will dispel perplexity (al-FarabT, p. 14), he deliberately mixes and fuses them. Unlike Maimonides, who claims that the allegorical interpreta- tion of scripture will dispel the perplexity caused by literal readings (Maimonides, p. 6), Ibn 'ArabT affirms an esoteric hermeneutic which guarantees perplexity by seeing history, text, the phenomenal world, and dreams as various levels of dreams and dreams within dreams. And instead of resolving contradictions, the Sufi master inverses the very principle of contradiction by appealing to an ultimate coincidentia oppositorum. I should emphasize that, throughout his works, he shows a lucid awareness of the rules he is breaking. Toshihiko Izutsu (p. 81) states that Ibn 'Arabi affirmed a station beyond hayra: "In the mind of a sage who has experienced the Unity of Being in its real depth there is no longer any place for any 'perplexity."' Izutsu bases this opinion on a very obscure passage (Ibn 'ArabT, Fusuas, 1:78-79), which can be read in different ways depending on how one punctuates it, and on the opinion of the commentator al-QashanT. I suggest that Qashani, like many commentators, attempts to rationalize and tame the open system of his master. It may be true that Ibn 'Arabi does affirm a state beyond hayra, but such a state should be seen in dialectical relationship with the hayra. The individual that breaks free from the chains of binding will be in a state of hayra, qua individual, though on a deeper level (the complete human being), the state of certainty (yaqTn) is achieved. The greater the hayra on the level of individual consciousness, the greater the certainty on the level of universal conscious- ness. The highest understanding is the deepest awareness of mystery. To affirm a static, nondialectical state of knowledge would be to invite the error of binding. 303</page><page sequence="18">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames you would have taken them down from their high station though everything [including the shore] is Allah's, and in Allah, and is Allah.26 Noah called on his Lord as if he could call on a fixed reality. The mystic knower, on the other hand, realizes the union of servant and lord ("Who knows his self, knows his Lord")27 and realizes the merging of his particular lord with all the lords (all the personal aspects of divinity and individual essences). Thus there is a very different way of addressing the Lord, between Noah and between the mystic knower who chants, "My lord, increase me in bewilderment in you." The critique of epistemic reification and linear logic is not confined to the categories of religious belief, philosophical concept, and scho- lastic dogma. It extends to Sufism itself and to the Sufi hierarchy founded on the notion of maqam (or muqam), the station. A station is a kind of plateau along the Sufi path (tarTqa). It is opposed to the hal, the momentary condition. At a given moment one's condition may be above or below the station. (For this reason one cannot judge the station of another.) Yet even the mystic station may be a binding. Even those who achieve the highest station, that of "pole" (qutb), the closest realization of the complete human being in a particular individual existence-even such a station can be a binding. Speaking of the notion that each pole is modeled on a given prophet or prophetic wisdom, Ibn 'ArabT deconstructs the entire Sufi hierarchy by speaking of a Muhammadian pole (a pole modeled on the Muhammadian ruh or spirit-logos), the pole of transformation, the station that is no station: Each "pole" is related to a particular prophet except for one who is in the Muhammadian mode Nothing is more universal in its distinction than the lack of limitation [taqyTd] to a distinguishing station The Muhammadian is distinguished only by his lack of distinguishing station 26 Ibn 'Arabi, Fusus, 1:73. 27 A central Sufi hadTth. The importance of Sufi hadTth accounts, either the reported words of Muhammad or the divine words reported to have been spoken to Muhammad (hadTth qudsT, sacred hadith), is overwhelming in the case of Ibn 'ArabT. This importance is brought out admirably in the indexes to hadTth in the Yahya edition of Futuihat. 304</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions His station is that he has no station This means that a condition [hal] can prevail on a person so that only through it is he known [or does he know]: he is related to it and determined by it But the relation of stations to a Muhammadian is like the relation of names to Allah He is not determined in any station to which he may be related Rather, in every breath, in every time, in every condition he is the image of what that breath, time, or condition requires His limitation does not remain The divine decrees [ahkam] vary in every moment and he varies in accordance with them For He ( ): "Every day He is in a different state" [Qur'an 55:29] And so, similarly, is the Muhammadian Thus His word ( ): "That is a reminder [dhikr] for one who has a heart." He did not say "intellect" ['aql], something which would bind Him The heart is named "heart" [qalb] because of its perpetual transformation [taqallub] in stations and orders in accordance with the breaths . . . The Muhammadian pole or Individual changes perpetually with each breath in knowledge just as all creation changes in condition The Muhammadian increases in knowledge of what he is transformed in and through not of the transformation itself For transformation pervades the world entire and pervades him.28 "Nothing is more universal in its distinction than the lack of distinguishing station." This statement reflects the dialectical logic of Ibn 'Arabi's critique of Noah. By affirming transcendence without immanence, Noah limited his god by marking it off from the world and thus subverted his own affirmation of transcendence. True affirmation of transcendence demands the transcendence of the normal notion of transcendence. It demands a dialectic of transcen- dence and immanence. Similarly, the highest mystic station is that 28 Ibn 'ArabT, Futuhat (1911) (n. 5 above), 4:76-77. The Yahya edition has not yet reached this point in the text. 305</page><page sequence="20">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames which transcends the high-low polarity. This also entails a tran- scendence of the distinction between sacred and profane, between the mystical experience and everyday reality. These two realms are powerfully fused in the theory of moments and breaths hinted at in the above passage. ETERNAL NOW: MOMENT, BREATH, dhikr In using the term waqt (moment), Ibn cArab! is following the Sufi tradition. The early Sufi called himself the "son of his moment" (ibn al-waqt), by which he meant that he gave no consideration to planning his future livelihood. Instead, he practiced the virtue of tawakkul, putting one's trust in Allah.29 MuhyT al-DTn has taken this term out of its earlier ascetic context and combined it with the kalim scholastic notion of the instant (an). The theory of the instant was part of the controversy over causality, free will, and determinism in which the scholastics were embroiled. In the course of this controversy (called the "occasionalist" dispute), an atomistic physics was developed. The world was seen as made up of discrete, invisible atoms and accidents which are destroyed and recreated by Allah in every instant. There is thus no causal necessity operating on a physical plane between one instant and the next. The instants themselves have the same characteristics as the atoms, since the temporal must be in keeping with the spatial. Instants are thus discrete, discontinuous, indivisible moments of time. One might call them temporal atoms.30 The occasionalist theory and the problems out of which it developed (an attempt to solve rationally the question of divine freedom and causal necessity) can have no final meaning in a system based on subverting the dualistic bases of the controversy. Yet the theory of the instant, stripped of its occasionalist context, was to exert a special fascination for Ibn 'Arab!. The recreation of the world in every instant is no longer seen as an occasionalist recreation of the objec- tive, physical world by an exterior creator, but rather as the continual passing away and creation that occurs infana' and baqi' and in the perpetually self-transforming process of tajallT-kashf (self-unveiling/ unveiling). Using a Qur'anic reference to the new creation, Ibn 'Arab! accuses the scholastics of misunderstanding the theory: 29 For a discussion of this early Sufi, ascetic notion of waqt, see Goldziher (n. 2 above), p. 133. 30 One of the clearer accounts of these atomistic theories is to be found in Maimonides, bk. 1, chap. 73, where they are discussed under the rubric of the ten premises of the mutakallimun. The third premise treats the temporal aspect of the atomic theory (Maimonides, pp. 196-200). 306</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions And "they are in confusion about the new creation." [Qur'an 50:15] But the people of unveiling [kashf] see that Allah manifests Himself in every breath And that the manifestation never repeats itself And they see as witnesses that every manifestation presents a new creation and removes the old And its removal is nothing other than passing away [fana'] which is implicit in the manifestation And the remaining [baqi'] is what is presented by the new manifestation-so understand.31 Just as the moment represents a combination of Sufi and scholastic notions of time, so the term "breath" is also complex. It refers on the first level to the Breath of the Merciful mentioned earlier. But here the mythic dualisms of time and causality are all but effaced. The one primordial breath by which the world flowed into actuality is seen now as the eternal breath that always has occurred, and always is occurring. The breath is the eternal moment in which Allah exhales into being a new form and inhales or contracts from the old form even as the knower actualizes that process by receiving the new form and giving up the old. In Sufi meditation the knower pronounces a dhikr in each breath. In the following passage the complex terms dhikr, "moment," and "breath" are fused in a unified dynamic of recreation and transformation, a dynamic where the moments vary with the subject, as opposed to the uniform instants of the physical theory on which the new theory has been superimposed: The seeker continues to say with every breath "My lord, increase me in knowledge" as long as the sphere of the universe turns in His breath So that he attempts to make his moment his/His breath ... The moment lengthens or shortens in relation to the presence of its master The moment of some is an hour of others a day, a week, a month, a year, or once in a lifetime And some have no moment at all.32 31 Ibn 'Arabi, Fusus, 1:125. 32 Ibn cArab!, "Risalat al-Anwar" [Treatise on the lights], in Rasa'il Ibn 'ArabT (1948; reprint, Cairo: Dar Ihya' al-Turath al-'ArabT, 1968), pp. 17-18. This treatise has been translated by Rabia Terri Harris under the title Journey to the Lord of Power 307</page><page sequence="22">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames The moment is the nexus for the tajallT-kashf, the manifestation that comes about when the self-manifesting Truth and knowing human subject come together. The physical objectified recreation of the scholastics is merely a shadow reality, a phantom (shabah), the shadowy mirror that is the universe without the polishing of the complete human being. By combining the classical Sufi doctrine of fana' and baqai' with the dynamic notion of the moment of eternal now, itself an amalgam of Sufi and scholastic notions of time, Muhyi al-Din forms his theory of perpetual transformation. Though he has abandoned the occa- sionalist arguments of the scholastics, the dilemma of divine provi- dence and human freedom still remains central. One is compelled to wonder. Is it through union with the perpetually changing Truth in fandi and baqd' that the mystic knower achieves perpetual trans- formation? Or is the ability to achieve such transformation, to achieve the heart that is receptive of every form, the precondition for the union offana' and baqd'? The causality is equivocal. Such causal equivocation is the mark of enigma. That one cannot trace an unequivocal chain of cause and effect indicates a modal shift beyond the dualism of cause and effect. Rather than "solving" the question, Muhyi al-DTn's discourse evokes its mystery, a mystery which moti- vates the text, an aporia which lies always beneath the chain of surface argument. MYSTIC BEWILDERMENT, LOVE MADNESS Marvel, a garden among the flames. My heart has become receptive of every form.

I above), p. 44. 308</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions In returning to these verses, I have cited them with their final verse (the last two lines in the translation). This last verse is usually left out of citations since it refers to personalities familiar only to those versed in the Arabic poetic tradition: the most famous unrequited lovers. This reference was prepared for by the previous mention of the gazelle, which in pre-Islamic poetry was often associated with the poet's beloved and later had come to signify the beloved herself. With the meadow for gazelles, the rich classical tradition of Arabic poetry becomes another of the many contexts in which Ibn 'Arabl's thought takes form. This discussion has centered on the theory of the heart that is receptive of every form and the complex matrix of ideas which make it up. This matrix appears again in Ibn 'Arabl's commentary on the last verse of the poem concerning the unrequited love of the classical poets: "Allah has driven them mad with love. He afflicted them with love of their fellow [human beings] as a rebuttal to those who claim to love Him, but are not in like manner driven mad with love. Love deprived these [unrequited lovers] of their wits. It made them pass away from themselves at the sight in their imagination of the beloved."34 The term hayyam means to "bewilder with love" or "to drive mad with love." The lovers cited in the poem have been deprived of their wits ('uqulihim, the plural of 'aql, intellect), a direct play on the intellect-heart ('aql-qalb) issue. The lovers are made to pass away in fania just as the mystic is made to pass away from his or her ego self into the Truth. In another part of the Interpreter of Desires the connection between mystic bewilderment and love madness is drawn even more explicitly. 34 Ibn 'ArabT, Dhakha'ir al-A 'laq (n. I above), p. 50. In the same commentary, Ibn 'Arabi gives a dense interpretation of his statement "My heart has become receptive of every form." I did not rely on this commentary in the body of my exposition because MuhyT al-DTn has often been accused of writing an artificially concocted commentary to defend his mystic odes from charges of sensuality and heresy. Now that the meaning of the heart that is receptive of every form has been tied into the general body of his mystical philosophy, I cite his own commentary: "'My heart has become receptive of every form.' Another [an evident reference to himself, as the persona who authored his other works] has said that the heart [qalb] takes its name from its own perpetual transformation [taqallub]. It varies with the variation [tanawwuc] of the influences [waridat] upon it, which vary with the variation of its conditions [ahwal], which vary with the variation of the divine manifestations to its secret identity [sirr]. Religious law [or revelation, shar'] calls this 'perpetual itinerancy and substitution in forms' [al- tahawwul wa al-tabaddul ft al-suwar]." Since there is no such doctrine that I know of in the shar', considered either as revelation or as law, the use of the term here seems to be esoteric, perhaps a reference to the eternal revelation and law of which each prophet is a representation, but which the mystic can contact directly in the mystic union and the unveiling of kashf. 309</page><page sequence="24">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames Before turning to this passage for a conclusion, I would like to mention several well-known opinions concerning Ibn 'ArabT's thought and to evaluate them in the context of the above discussion. The theory of the heart that is receptive of every form has been seen to consist of a complex dynamic involving a wide set of mutually dependent ideas. In order to show how these elements fit together, I have presented a series of critical categories: monistic method, the tajallT-kashf dynamic, the perspective shift as the meaning event, and the modes of dialectic (oblique dialectic, mythic dialectic, metaphoric dialectic). The first question we are led to ask is whether the terms "monism" and "pantheism," which have so often been applied to Ibn 'Arabi's thought, are accurate. Do they reflect the oblique dialectic which was seen to be his guiding principle? This dialectic was capsulized in the statement that "the order lies between" the independence of the Truth from all relation and duality (in its aspect of Self) and the dynamic polarity of its manifest relationships (divine-human, lord-servant, names-world). The paradoxical nature of such a formulation is reflected in the statements that the highest station is the station of no station and that the most distinct is that which is distinct by its own lack of distinction. These are not explicative paradoxes or apparent contradictions. The contradiction lies at the very heart of the inner dynamic, although that dynamic follows its own rigorous and con- sistent dialectical logic. Thus, while it is true that the Self-beyond-all-relation is ultimately the only reality, this ultimate state does not nullify the other half of the oblique dialectic. Though "nonexistent" in themselves, it is the dynamic polarity of the divine names, the perspective shift they represent, that constitutes the meaning event. For this reason I prefer the phrase "monistic method" to the term "monism," if only because monism is so often seen as a doctrine rather than as a linguistic strategy. MuhyT al-DTn uses the internally paradoxical assertion that "all things are one" to guide the fusions and shifts which make up his writing. He is aware that no pure monistic doctrine can be expressed, since any expression involves dualisms of language and thought that contradict a pure monism. Louis Massignon's accusation that the grand master's monism destroyed the element of transcendence in Islamic mysticism seems particularly wide of the mark.35 It does not 35 Louis Massignon, Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique Musulmane (Paris: Librairie orientaliste Paul Geuthner, 1922), p. 285: "Ibn 'Arab!, 6pris de logique formelle, elimine, en fait, toute intervention transcendante de la divinit6, du domaine de la mystique." This opinion is based on a misunderstanding of 310</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions address the oblique dialectic: the more something is said to be immanent, the more it is affirmed to be transcendent; the most distinct is that which is distinct by its very lack of distinction. If one is to claim that transcendence has been abandoned, it is first necessary to discuss Ibn 'Arabi's critique of Noah's affirmation of transcendence and the dialectical logic that underlies his own. As for Charles Adams's statement that the followers of Ibn 'Arab! "teach outright pantheism, that there is only one reality, God, who is the sum of all things"36-such a formulation also neglects the dialectical and dynamic nature of the thought. No well-versed follower of the Sufi master would affirm the static, nondialectical notion that the one reality is the sum of all things. Other opinions touch even more directly on the theory of the heart that is receptive of every form. Annemarie Schimmel has characterized the poem with which this essay began as "highest self-praise" and states that "this seemingly tolerant statement contains, rather, a statement about the author's own lofty spiritual rank."37 It is certainly dialectical logic outlined in this essay, a logic which attempts to transcend formal logic through the dialectic of immanence and transcendence and through the dynamic, existential notion of tajalli-kashf, a notion which is radically experiential. Unfortu- nately, Massignon's misunderstanding has formed a stereotype which is as deeply rooted as it is inaccurate. Among many other instances of Massignon's attack on the Andalusian Sufi, I cite the following as an example (Massignon, p. 62): "C'est elle [the school of Ibn 'ArabT], 6galement, qui a consomm6 le schism entre les vocations mystiques musulmanes et leur rayonnement social-substituant au devoir de correction fraternelle la discipline qarmate de l'arcane,-r6servant l'apanage de la mystique, science 6soterique qui ne doit pas etre divulgu6e,-a des cercles initiatiques ferm6s, corporations intellectuelles fossiles, 'Gobineau-Verein' ou 'Stendhal-Club' de l'extase, fumeries d'opium surnaturel." 36 Charles Adams, "The Islamic Religious Tradition," in Religion and Man, ed. W. Richard Comstock (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971), p. 597. 37 Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (n. 3 above), pp. 271-72. Schimmel has confused the question by injecting into it the issue of tolerance. Of all those cited in n. 2 above who refer to these verses, only Goldziher used the term "tolerance." Tolerance was socially and politically defined in Islamic law, and Ibn 'ArabT was neither a social nor a political revolutionary. Thus it is true that he did not advocate tolerance. This does not at all detract from the significance of these verses as a call for universality, a universality which was to be achieved not through political or social confrontation of the Islamic law but through the inner transformation of the indi- vidual's heart-a transformation which would make the question of tolerance irrele- vant. Tolerance is a very weak virtue (we tolerate those whom we refuse to understand). Ibn 'Arabi's theory calls not for the toleration, but for the complete embracement, of all forms of belief and manifestation. In As through a Veil (n. 3 above), pp. 38-39, Schimmel once again states that the verses do not express tolerance and then goes on to say that "the poem is, however, a glowing tribute to Islam." This statement does not reflect Ibn 'Arabl's own explicit comment that this love and religion is the love of the Muhammadians. This term was mistakenly translated by Nicholson as "Moslems" (Ibn 'Arabi, The Tarjumdn al-Ashwdq: A Collection of Mystical Odes [n. 2 above], p. 69). As has been made clear in this essay, the term does not refer to Muslims but rather to 311</page><page sequence="26">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames true that Ibn 'Arabi speaks often in his works of his mystical experiences and stations. The establishment of one's rank or station was part of Sufi life and involved sophisticated procedures for validation of these "credentials" that are still largely unstudied. But Schimmel's characterization neglects the irony involved in Ibn 'Arabi's assertion: to celebrate the achievement of the station of no station is a very ambivalent assertion of high rank, since the very high-low dualism on which it is based is being transcended. Furthermore, since this station (of no station) can only be achieved through the passing away of the individual in fana', the voice here cannot be simply identified with the ego-self of the author of the poem. The "I" is the complete human being that the mystic can realize only through passing out of his or her self. The entire theory of binding is brought to bear against the danger Ibn 'Arab! perceived in the Sufis' assertion of lofty spiritual stations, and the very terms "lofty spiritual rank" figure in one of his most scathing critiques of binding. No one bound within a station, no matter how lofty, could achieve the heart that is receptive of every form.38 Abdurrahman Badawi, in a discussion of Islamic mysticism and existentialism, maintains that Ibn 'ArabT, unlike earlier mystics, did not live any of his ideas and is thus of little interest to modern existential thought.39 Ibn 'ArabT's Sufism certainly differs from that those who have achieved the station of no station and who refuse to bind themselves to any one prophetic wisdom. The verses are a tribute to the religion of the Muham- madian, the religion of the heart that is receptive of every form. Schimmel, who relies on Nicholson in her interpretation, has mistakenly identified the "religion" referred to in the verses with Islam when, in fact, as is made clear throughout Ibn 'Arabi's writings, very few Muslims are Muhammadians. See Ibn 'ArabT, Dhakhd'ir al-A'ldq (n. 1 above), p. 50. 38 See just above, n. 37 above, and Ibn 'ArabT's denunciation of the angels who claim a high rank and exalted position: mansab 'dl wa manzila rafT'a 'ind allah (FusSs, 1:49). The angels violated the principle of adab, propriety. It is a knowledge of adab (which can also mean nobility, refinement, wit, sagacity) that guards an individual from falling into arrogance, presumption, and binding. According to the principle of adab, one never praises one's ego-self in anything. The only self-praise that is valid is the Self-praise of the complete human being, which is only realized when the individual ego-self passes away. The angels' self-praise was a violation of adab, and thus Allah humbled them by making them prostrate themselves before Adam (the complete human being). Ibn CArabT exhorts his readers to learn from the example of the angels that to claim a lofty rank is to fall from it (Fusus, 1:51). 39 Abdurrahman Badawi, "Les Points de rencontre de la mystique Musulmane et de 1'existentialisme," Studia Islamica 27 (1967): 75. Badawi also faults Ibn 'Arabi for his effort to include all wisdoms in a comprehensive universality: "La preuve en est son chef-d'oeuvre Fusus al-hikam: tandis qu'al-Hallaj se limite a une seule personnalite, celle de Jesus, et SuhrawardT s'attache a Zoroastre, nous voyons Ibn 'Arabi, par suite de sa tendance encyclop6dique et syncr6tique, je dirais meme 6clectique, embrasser tous les prophetes dans son experience-rationelle?-existentielle" (ibid.). Badawi, who on the previous page has mentioned Massignon's work on al-Hallaj as the exemplar of the 312</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions of the earlier, more ascetic Sufis. But the attempt to look through the Andalusian master's life for evidence that he actually lived his ideas ignores the continuous quality of his notion of fana' and baqa': to think of some particular experience or form as universally ratifying makes no sense in a system which not only sees every moment as a living of the idea, but sees the "idea" as the unfolding of life itself. From the perspective of the moment, the notion of living one's ideas is redundant. If Ibn 'Arabi does not act out his ideas, it is because his effort is focused on transcending the distinction between idea and life, idea and experience. I suggest that his view of meaning as involved in a continual process of self-creation within the tajalli-kashf and divine-human polarities is of interest not only to existentialism but to other forms of modern thought as well. Both the specific ideas discussed here and Ibn 'Arabl's thought in general pose other problems for historical and comparative study. The similarity of these ideas to many forms of Eastern thought, as well as to the Christian mysticism of Meister Eckhart,40 raises com- plex comparative issues. I should emphasize that, although Hindu and Buddhist ideas were known in Ibn 'ArabT's Spain in a very general way and though he could well have been influenced by some of them, his thought is neither anomalous nor extraneously induced. It is both deeply rooted in the spirit of twelfth- and thirteenth-century Islam and one of the major expressions of it. The grand master traveled from Andalusia to Anatolia in a flourishing and developed Sufi society where the general premises on which his writings are based were inherent.4' His ideas also represent a strong permanent strain within Islam and have found vibrant expression in modern effort at finding an existential interpretation of Islamic mysticism, is following Massignon's criticism of the grand master: "Tendance th6osophique, perceptible chez Manes et chez Ibn 'ArabT; qui ne comprennent pas que l'accs au but mystique depend avant tout du choix judicieux d'un seul moyen, fortifiant l'intention dans son orienta- tion inflexible; eux s'imaginent trouver plus sOrement acces a l'union divine, en usant concurremment de tous les 'moyens cultuels,' et cet eclectisme syncr6tiste les prive d'apercevoir la diff6renciation transformante, irr6parable, qui s'opere graduellement, en cours de route, entre ceux qui se prosternent le long de la 'Via Crucis,' et ceux qui s'6tendent sous le char de Jaggernauth" (Massignon, p. 30, n. 1). 40 For specific parallels, see Sells, "Metaphor and Dialectic" (n. 9 above), pts. 3, 4. 41 Throughout his works, MuhyT al-Din recounts stories of his encounters with other Sufis, the kind of language and dialogue they engaged in, and their implicit and immediate recognition of the premises on which his thought is based. These encounters extend from his homeland of Andalusia (especially the centers of Cordoba and Seville), through the great cities of North Africa (Fez, Marrakesh, Kairouan, Cairo), to the Arabian peninsula (where he wrote his Futuhat or Meccan revelations), and eastward: Baghdad, Konya, and Damascus, where he is buried. The only place his ideas encountered dangerous opposition was in Egypt. 313</page><page sequence="28">Ibn 'ArabT's Garden among the Flames times.42 At the very least, a reexamination of these ideas shows the need for a more careful and nuanced treatment of Islam in compara- tive studies.43 Finally, I suggest that the theory of the heart that is receptive of every form may offer insight into a methodology of comparative study. Ibn 'Arabi's discussion of the "gods of belief' is based on a logic which sees unity and difference not as mutually exclusive but as dialectically reinforcing. Such a dialectic may offer a richer mode of inquiry than the present argument about whether or not religions or mystical experiences are essentially the same or essentially different. The oblique dialectic represented in the reinter- pretation of the Noah story poses a dynamic notion of identity between the particular and unique forms of manifestation and the unity beyond all form and relation. In this perspective, to deny either the plurality or the unity is to fall into reification and binding and to lose the dialectic. There is no room to pursue these questions in this essay, already growing long. I hope they have been shown to be of interest. I would like to close by addressing again the impression that Ibn 'Arabl's Sufism is "intellectual" (as opposed to emotional), "gnostic" (in that it makes salvation dependent on some special knowledge available only to an elite), and even "cold" (all of these characterizations are interrelated). In the introductory poem to the Interpreter of Desires, and in the commentary on it,44 Ibn 'Arab! treats the divine "appear- ances" (zawahir) as the beloved of the mystic lover. Once again the tajallT-kashf dynamic polarity of unveiling is invoked: the appearance cannot happen without the viewer, and the viewer cannot exist without the appearance. The ephemeral nature of the appearances 42 See Martin Lings, A Sufi Saint of the Twentieth Century: Shaikh Ahmad al- 'AlawT (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961, 1973). 43 For example, see Stephen Katz's attempt to show that the Sufi doctrine offani' and baqai' has nothing in common with the Buddhist notion of nothingness. Katz defines baqci' as "everlasting life in Allah" and states that there is no "God or God-like Being in Buddhism": Stephen Katz, "Language, Epistemology, and Mysticism," in Mysticism and Philosophical Analysis, ed. S. Katz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978), p. 54. Though his description offani' and baqai' might be valid for many Sufis, the terms he uses could not apply to Ibn 'Arabl's version of the doctrine. In MuhyT al-Din, the human and divine are invoked in a continual process of Self- creation through mutual determination, so that terminology like "everlasting life in Allah" does not apply very well. See also n. 6 above on the imprecision of the term "God" when applied to the thought of the Andalusian master. I suggest that we speak of modes of Islamic thought and modes within the mode of mysticism. The mode represented by Ibn 'Arab! may well have more in common with certain modes of other traditions than it does with other modes of Sufism. The attempt to come to a one- paragraph definition of a central Sufi doctrine and then to compare it to other traditions simplifies the wide divergences within Sufism. 44 Ibn 'Arabi, Dhakhi'ir al-A Cldq (n. 1 above), pp. 9-10. 314</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions (and consequently of the "lives" of the viewer) is a source of halak (perishing of the lover) and of bewilderment (hayra). And the notion of love madness is invoked by the context so strongly that it does not have to be mentioned explicitly. The intensity of the lover's experience is directly proportional to its ephemerality. This tension infuses all of Ibn 'Arabl's writings, not just the love odes. The more the Sufi achieves the transformation of the heart, the greater is the temptation to stop at a given point and bind.45 And the greater is the sorrow at giving up the old form and joy at finding the new. While Muhyl al- Din is intellectual in the sense that he is willing to consider seriously any thought or belief system, his is hardly a rationalistic or abstract philosophy. To give up binding, to achieve a state of continuous passing away in each new appearance or manifestation demands neither a special gnosis (the secret is that there is no secret in the sense of an objective "known") nor high intellectual rank. Rather, it demands a transcending of the classical distinction between the way of knowledge and the way of love. Stanford University 45 See Ibn 'Arabi, Journey, where the Sufi master describes a series of mystical experiences with the constant exhortation not to stop at any of them. The final experience is the fana' and baqa' which, as was seen, turns out to be a continually repeated transformation in each moment and each breath. 315</page></plain_text>
