<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONTROVERSY IN THE TIME OF THEOPHILUS OF ALEXANDRIA MASSEY HAMILTON SHEPHERD, JR., University of Chicago It was the long-established custom of the Alexandrian patriarch to write each year a paschal letter to the faithful of his province. In the letter of the year 399 the Patriarch The- ophilus, an ecclesiastic of great ability but few scruples, in- veighed rather severely against those who taught that God was corporeal, or in other words that God had bodily form. This opinion was by no means extraordinary. For over two centuries Alexandria had been the leading center of Christian theology, and for a much longer period a pre-eminent seat of philosophic learning as well. The repudiation of anthropomor- phic conceptions of God had long been a matter of common acceptance by pagan and Christian theologians alike who laid any claim to a liberal education. The letter of Theophilus did not receive, however, a very cordial welcome among the monks of the lower Egyptian deserts. The phenomenal growth of the monks in numbers and their renowned reputation for piety had for some years been exciting the interest of people all over the Christian world. Among the pilgrims visiting these desert saints just at this particular time was the Westerner Cassian, with his companion Germanus. Cassian heard the letter of Theophilus read at Scete just a few days after his first conference with Abbot Isaac, and noted that the majority of the monks received the mnessage of their patriarch "with bitterness," and charged Theophilus with heresy for impugning the plain teaching of Holy Scripture. None of the elders of Scete would let it be read in the assemblies except Abbot Paphnutius.' As there were four churches for assemblies of monks in Scete, we may judge the extent of the opposition. So disturbed were the monks that they proceeded in a body 1 Collationes x. 2.

Theophilus was a clever politician, and with characteristic adroitness he appeared before them in a conciliatory manner, saying "When I look at you, I behold the face of God." This mollified the monkish mob to some extent. They informed him that if he really be- lieved God's countenance to be like theirs, he must anathematize Origen's theology. To save himself and break up the mob, Theophilus unhesitatingly complied. It was very probably this tumultuous scene which was described by Sulpitius Severus" who said that crowded synods passed decrees that no one should read or possess the works of Origen. Ultimately, the prefect of the city was called in to quell the disturbance and restore order, and, according to Sulpitius, the monks had to flee. The issue of the controversy is well-known. Theophilus found his forced condemnation of Origenism a convenient excuse for his designs against four former friends, the so-called "Tall Brothers," who were monks at Nitria-Dioscorus, Am- monius, Eusebius, and Euthymius. He wrote to the monks again affirming this time that he believed God to be corporeal, and denouncing Dioscorus and his associates for teaching the opposite and being followers of Origen. It was not difficult to stir up violence when tempers were so heated. With an armed force the patriarch went out to Nitria, and in the face of this, Dioscorus' group had to flee. They went first to Pal- estine, then in company with Isidore proceeded to Constanti- nople. Their reception by St. Chrysostom, then patriarch at Constantinople, started another quarrel, which ended ultimately in St. Chrysostom's downfall. But this story needs no retelling here. An interesting sidelight on the whole affair is found in a Coptic fragment of a Vita of one Aphou, a monk of Oxyrhyncus.3 The story relates that when Aphou heard 2 Dialogus, i, 6-7; cf. Jerome, Epistolae, 92. 3 First published by Francesco Rossi with Italian translation in "Trascrizione di tre Manoscriti copti del Museo egizio di Torino con Traduzione italiana," (Me- morie della reale Accademia delle Scienze di Torino, scienze, morale, storiche e fililogiche), Serie II, Tom XXXVII (1886), 67-84, 145-150. I have used the edition with French translation by Pltienne Drioton, "La Discussion d'un Moine anthropomorphite audien avec le Patriarche Th6ophile d'Alexandrie en 1'Annee 399," Revue de l'Orient chr6tien, XX (1915-17), 92-100, 113-128. Drioton (p. 93) considers the work to be genuine. 264</page><page sequence="3">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONTROVERSY Theophilus' paschal letter read, he objected to his saying, "No, our feebleness is not God's image." He thereupon proceeded to Alexandria, where after some delay he was received by the patriarch. Aphou claimed that the letter contradicted the teaching of Genesis 1:26 and 9:16, and related to Theophilus the following parable: There was a king who had an artist paint his picture. Everyone agreed that the portrait was the image of the king; yet, in reality, it was not of the same ma- terial as the king, and did not have actually the eyes, ears, nose and other features of the king. Theophilus declared himself convinced by the argument of the monk, and wrote a letter in retraction of his original views (evidently the letter he wrote against Dioscorus). Drioton, who published the fragment, is of the opinion that Theophilus simply used this monk as the "dupe" for his public volte-face. Aphou was his tool in his scheme against the "Tall Brothers." However that may be, the interest of the story, as Drioton has well pointed out, lies in the more refined and attractive presentation of the anthropo- morphic heresy by Aphou through his use of the parable of the king. He believes the Fathers suppressed this aspect of the heresy and reported it as one of extreme Scriptural literalness. The theology of Origen seems to have been a storm center of early monastic life. One recalls, for example, that St. Pachomius, the legislator of monasticism in Upper Egypt, recommended to his brother monks not to read Origen or even to listen to his books read by others. For many monks were illiterate and dependent upon others to read religious literature to them; the Scriptures they knew as a rule suf- ficiently by heart. On one occasion, St. Pachomius is said to have thrown into the water a book of Origen's which he found, and would have thrown it in the fire if it had not contained in it the name of God.4 The whole controversy, and particularly the battle over Origen, becomes illuminated if one sees in it a problem arising out of monastic habits and views concerning worship. The worship experience cherished by the Egyptian monks was that of mystic contemplation and vision of God, achieved by strin- 4 Vita altera graeca Sancti Pachomii, 27 (ed. Halkin, 195); Paralipomena, 7 (ed. Halkin, 131-2). See also the discussion of H. G. Evelyn White, The Monasteries of the Wddi'n NatrOn.

Such mystical worship presupposed a conception of God as utterly alien to all material and earthly things, totally invisible, immaterial, unbegotten, ineffable and, of course, incorporeal. This religious outlook was by no means peculiar to the Christian monks. It pervaded the philosophy of the day. Its classic expression in the pagan world had been made some 150 years before the time of this controversy at the hands of Plotinus, and at the same time it appeared in Christian theology in the work of Plotinus' friend and fellow-Alexandrian, namely, Origen. Since Origen figured so prominently in the controversy under discussion it may be well to quote a few salient passages from his works. His point of view could be duplicated in many other writers and thinkers, both pagan and Christian. It should be noted that such mystical worship demanded an allegorical interpretation of Scripture, in order to assist one in gaining "spiritual" insights. For what intelligent man will not smile at one who, with so great and so many words about god and gods in philosophy, looks upon images and indeed sends up to them prayer or imagines that by looking upon these vis- ible things one can ascend from the seen and symbolic to the intelligible? But even the common Christian has believed that every place in the world is a part of the universe, the whole world being the temple of God:praying"in every place," shutting the eyes of sense and awakening those of the soul, he rises above the whole world. Nor does he stop at the vault of heaven, but coming in mind to the place above the heavens, guided by the divine Spirit, and, as it were, obtaining a place beyond the world, he sends up prayer to God, but not for chance things; for he has learned from Jesus to seek nothing base, i.e. sensible, but only the great things and truly divine, such things being given by God to lead to that blessedness which is from Him through His Son the Word, who is God.5 When, then, our mind's eye is thus uplifted so that we are no longer preoccupied with things of the earth nor filled with images derived from material things and are solely occupied with the thought of God, we con- verse reverently and modestly with Him who listens to us.6 It is needful to warn those who yearn to lead a spiritual life in Christ that they should not ask for trifling nor merely worldly things when they 5 Contra Celsum, vii, 44. 6 De oratione, 9 (trans. Pope). 266</page><page sequence="5">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONTROVERSY pray; rather I would exhort readers of this treatise to pray for those mystic things of which we have but types in the things of which I have been speaking. Now prayer for the said spiritual or mystic things is only perfected in him who wars not according to the flesh, but who through the Spirit puts to death the things of the flesh, and who makes far more ac- count of what the anagogical sense (of Holy Scripture) will reveal to those who seek it than of any reward which the literal sense (of Scripture) may suggest as likely to accrue to those who pray. For we must be careful lest our souls should prove sterile; rather, then, should we listen with spiritual ears to the spiritual law so that we may cease to be sterile but may be heard as were Anna and Ezechias.7 When Theophilus, to save himself, denounced Origen and those monks who followed his teaching, "such as had a culti- vated mind," said the historian Socrates, "were not beguiled by this plausibility, and therefore still adhere to Dioscorus and Origen."8 Some monks indeed were well-educated and widely read in theology. It will be recalled that the Scetic abbot Paphnutius allowed the paschal letter of Theophilus which had condemned anthropomorphism to be read in the assemblies, though none of the other elders did so. This abbot undoubtedly agreed with the opinions represented in the letter, for Cassian in his Conferences reported him as having said: We shall succeed in reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sul- lied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine and spiritual contemplation has so far passed to the things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes.9 Others under whom Cassian received spiritual instruction, notably Abbots Moses and Isaac, had very much the same point of view about meditation and contemplation of things divine. The latter said: Our mind will reach that incorruptible prayer . . . [which] is not merely not engaged in gazing on any image. but is actually distinguished by the use of no words or utterances; but with the purpose of the mind all on fire, is produced through ecstasy of heart by some unaccountable keen- ness of spirit, and the mind being thus affected without the aid of the senses 7 Ibid., 13. 8 Hist. eccl., vi, 9. 9 Coll., iii, 7 (trans. Gibson). 267</page><page sequence="6">CHURCH HISTORY or any visible material pours it forth to God with groanings and sighs that cannot be uttered.10 Abbot Moses spoke of such worship: "the soul, soaring above all things visible, is actually joined to the word of God by the contemplation of heavenly things."" The hermit John, described in the Historia Monachorum ascribed to Rufinus, was an opponent of anthropomorphism. He is reported as having said: We can, in so far as is possible, even see God, and when praying, di-- rect the eye of our heart towards him, and see the invisible with the mind, but not the body: by the discernment of the understanding, not in the ap- pearance of the flesh. For no one should think that he can look upon the divine nature itself such as it is, so that he may form for himself some form or image in his heart of any corporeal likeness. No form of God should be pondered, no limits, but the sense and feeling, and the mind which can indeed feel it and seize the mood of the mind, nevertheless can- not comprehend or describe, or avail to narrate it.12 A similar point of view found expression in the Syriac recen- sion of the Apophthegmata Patrum: B.[rother] How ought a man to see the order of the divine vision? O.[ld] M.[an] The Scriptures have shewn [him how]. B. How? O. M. Daniel saw Him as the Ancient of Days. And EZEKIEL saw Him on the chariot of the CHERUBIM. And ISAIAH saw Him upon a lofty and glorious throne. And MosEs persisted in being with Him Who cannot be seen, as if he saw Him. B. And how can the mind see that which cannot be seen? O. M. A king cannot be seen, as far as his exact image is concerned, when he is sitting on the throne. B. And is it right for a man to depict God in this manner? O. M. And which is the better for a man, to depict God in his mind in this manner, or to bow himself down to many abominable thoughts? B. Peradventure this is accounted as sin? O. M. No. Only thou must hold according to what the Scriptures have shewn [thee], and the fulfilment of the matter will come of itself, even as the Apostle said, "Now as in a miracle, we see in parable, but then face to face," the meaning of which is as if a man were to say, "When the mind hath been made perfect, then it will be able to see with ease and freedom." 10 Ibid., x, 11. 11 Ibid., iii, 6. 12 (P.

If a man performeth his strife in truth there will be no con- fusion in the mind .. .13 One of the most distinguished men among the Egyptian monks was one Evagrius, a native of Pontus, who came to Egypt in 383 at the suggestion of the lady Melania. He had formerly been a preacher in the city of Constantinople, whither Gregory of Nyssa took him after his ordination. But a serious temptation which endangered his virginity had caused him to flee from the capital city to Palestine. Evagrius was a zealous student of Origen and much of his thought was taken from him.'4 He divided the way of piety into the "practical," whose aim was apathy, and the "theoretical," which aimed at knowl- edge of God (Gnosis). That is to say, the world of sense must be divested before knowledge of God could be reached by con- templation. A few quotations will be sufficient to show his point of view. Whenever the mind, having put off the old man, would put on that of grace, then it shall see its own peace at the time of prayer, like to a sap- phire or heavenly color, which the Scriptures also call the place of God, having been seen by the elders on Mount Sinai. The mind would not see the place of God in itself, except it had become raised above all external things. And it will not be above them unless it has put off the passions which bind it through perceptions to the senses. And the passions will be put away by the exercise of virtues, and foolish reasonings by spiritual contemplation; and that again, when the light shines upon it, that light which marks out the place of God at the time of prayer.15 Those who seek to see the things of the body need a pure mind; and to see the incorporeal, of overmuch purity, rather than much; if we take upon ourselves to see the holy Trinity.6l The naked mind is that which has been perfected in seeing and is worthy of sharing in the contemplation of the holy Trinity.17 13 96, edited by E.

Had he lived a few more months, it is certain that he would have been involved in the controversy, for he was a great admirer of Origen. Simple and unlettered monks found it difficult, if not im- possible, to say their prayers and make their devotions on such a lofty plane of contemplation of purely spiritual and formless Being. Many of them, said Socrates-"most" of them, accord- ing to Sozomen-were unable to penetrate further than the literal word of the Scriptures, which, it must be remembered, were the sole material and content of the monks' worship. To them the words of Genesis 1:26 meant just what they said. Cassian told of such a simple monk named Sarapion. Abbot Paph- nutius had requested Photinus, a learned deacon from Cappadocia who was sojourning in Scete at the time, to expound the mean- ing of Genesis 1:26. This he did, explaining that it must be taken in a "spiritual" sense; i. e, God's nature was "incorporeal, incomposite and simple" and could not be apprehended by the eyes or conceived by the mind. Sarapion declared himself convinced by Photinus' eloquence; for, said Cassian, he had erred "only because of ignorance and rustic simplicity." But when the assembly of monks arose to offer prayers, "the old man was so bewildered in mind during his prayer because he felt that the Anthropomorphic image of the Godhead which he used to set before himself in prayer, was banished from his heart, that on a sudden he burst into a flood of bitter tears and continual sobs, and cast himself down on the ground and ex- claimed with strong groanings: 'Alas! wretched man that I am! they have taken away my God from me, and I have now none to lay hold of; and whom to worship and address I know not'."'l It should be noted that the name of this simple monk, Sarapion, indicates that he was a Copt. His name also recalls the non-Christian religious background of the native Egyptians, i.e. the Isis-Sarapis mysteries. He may be considered as typical of a large number, perhaps the great majority of monks living in the Egyptian deserts, who were either themselves converts from paganism to Christianity, or had come from homes which at one time or another had been attached to the native religion 18 Coll., x, 3. 270</page><page sequence="9">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONTROVERSY of Egypt. It was the custom in the temples of the Egyptian mysteries'1 to display each day in the temple shrine the statue of the goddess Isis. At the daily matins service a priest, clad in white linen, drew back the curtain which veiled the image from the worshipers, while libations of holy Nile water were poured out and a fire kindled to purify the sanctuary. Then the priest, standing on the threshold of the shrine which con- tained the image, awakened the goddess by calling her name in the Egyptian language. A burnt offering was celebrated, ac- companied with song. The stolists then robed the statue of the goddess and adorned it with jewels and the sistrum. The image was thus exposed to view during the day until the after- noon service, so that devout worshipers might come and offer their prayers and vows before it.20 There was also in each temple an innermost shrine entered only by those initiated into the mysteries, where, if we interpret rightly the account of initiation given by Apuleius, one ex- perienced the vision of a dazzling light.21 That this innermost room was without any image of the deity may be inferred not only from Apuleius, but also from an account which comes to us from the time of Claudius or Nero of a doctor of Tralles named Thessalus.2 Despairing of his failure at Alexandria, this physician supplicated the gods to come to his aid by send- ing him a dream or vision. At the temple of Asclepius (or Imhotep) at Thebes, an old priest promised to help him "have converse with the gods." He conducted Thessalus to a secluded place where for three days he was ordered to purify himself as a necessary condition for an evocation. On the third day he was conducted into a hall with an empty throne-evidently the innermost shrine of the temple. When the priest had pro- nounced the unutterable names of the god, the deity was pro- duced and Thessalus was left "to converse with him 'alone to the alone.' " Whether one interprets this as an act of contem- 19 The Sarapeum at Alexandria is described in Rufinus, Historia ecclesiastica, ii, 23; for the Iseum uncovered at Pompeii, see A.

We are thus in a position to appreciate the figures used by more sophisticated religious spirits, such as Plotinus, the founder of the Neoplatonic school, whom we have already noted as a contemporary and friend of Origen. The phrase "alone to the alone" was adopted by him as a characteristic expression to describe the highest experience of worship. In the summary of his philosophy, at the close of the Enneades, Plotinus stated that the summum bonum of the philosophic life was union with the Supreme, "not a vision compassed but a unity appre- hended," and once this ascent was achieved there was "no movement, no passion, no outlooking desires." Even reason was in abeyance. "Caught away, filled with God, he has in perfect stillness attained isolation." It was "like one who, hav- ing penetrated the inner sanctuary, leaves the temple images behind him . . . for There his converse was not with image, not with trace, but with very Truth in view of which all the rest is but of secondary concern." "This is the life of gods and of the godlike and blessed among men, liberation from the alien that besets us here, a life taking no pleasure in the things of earth, the passing of solitary to solitary.25 The sharp distinction drawn by Plotinus between those who stop to worship before the image in the inner shrine, and those who advance further into the innermost shrine where they contemplate without the aid of any visible or material form, illuminates a similar dichotomy in methods of worship among Christian monks. The unlearned, such as Sarapion and Aphou, who heard the Scripture read at the common assemblies of worship, understood Genesis 1:26 quite literally, and, pictur- ing in their mind's eye their God in human form, offered their prayers to such an ideal image. Roughly speaking, this was 23 F.

Many of them were Greeks and not native to Egypt, as Evagrius Ponticus. These recalled with approval the answer of Origen, when queried by Celsus as to why Christians spurned images of God, because they did not believe him to have human form and at the same time held that man was made in the image of God. Origen said that the image was not man's body, but that man's resemblance to God was "in the rational soul, made ac- cording to virtue."26 The heresy seems to have continued for some time in Egypt, as is evident from the fact that Cyril was constrained to write a treatise against it to the monks of Mount Calamon. He said: "Those who are of sound mind, and implant the eye of their own minds strongly upon considerations of the ineffa- ble divinity, see it beyond every created thing, surpassing the most acute mind, and being absolutely beyond corporeal fantasy, and according to the saying of the all wise Paul 'dwelling in inapproachable light.'
