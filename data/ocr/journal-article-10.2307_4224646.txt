<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jl JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES bl Vol. XI No. 4 December 1977 A Social Value Theory in Neoinstitutional Economics Marc R. Tool As the economics of allocation is gradually replaced or succeeded by the economics of valuation, to employ Philip Klein's useful distinction be- tween neoclassical orthodoxy and neoinstitutional heterodoxy,' the neces- sity of formalizing and extending concepts of social value (criteria of choice) in neoinstitutional thought becomes more and more important. The shift from critique to reconstruction is mandated by the pressure of economic problems unresolved and by demands for relevant counsel. Many, if not most, neoinstitutionalists recognize that there is no way to avoid value judgments in economic analysis. If inquiry is purposive, it is value laden. Purposive social inquiry is directed to problem solving. To perceive a problem is to distinguish between is and ought, to apply value theory. Value premises focus and direct inquiry; they define significance and relevance. Neoinstitutionalists are not, presumably, normally among those "in the unhappy position of seeming to believe that reason and evi- dence have persuasive roles in scientific inquiry but are somehow either absent, or radically different in their efficacy in evaluation. Since it is through evaluation that we determine what is important, it comes peril- ously close to saying of the important we have nothing important to say."2 They appear likely to agree with John H. Schaar that "a rigorous ad- The author is Professor of Economics, California State University, Sacramento. 823</page><page sequence="2">824 Marc R. Tool herence to the 'fact-value dichotomy' renders intelligence cautious just where it must be bold, dumb where it should be articulate."3 They would probably concur with Joan Robinson that "to eliminate value judgments from the subject-matter of social science is to eliminate the subject itself,"4 and with Kenneth Arrow that "a public or social value system is essentially a logical necessity."5 Reason and evidence-these must be the key. Neoinstitutionalists seek value theory that is a product of reasoned, logically credible inquiry into the evidences of human experience. Most neoinstitutionalists evidently have long since refused to be im- paled on either horn of the positive-normative dilemma, have recognized the sterility and inapplicability of ethical relativism, and have rejected the exclusivity and certitude of ethical absolutism. Most seem intellectually unwilling and unable to have recourse to the positivist and relativist utility value theory of capitalists,6 to the normativist and absolutist "fulfill-the- historical-design" value theory of the Marxists, or to the differently formu- lated normativist and absolutist coercive power value theory of the fascists. Gunnar Myrdal has for many years called for the inclusion and rational examination of value theory in social and economic analysis.7 Robert Heilbroner and Ben Seligman,8 among others, have called for the articula- tion of a neoinstitutional paradigm as an alternative to orthodoxy. Promi- nent in such a paradigm must be a theory of social value.9 But neoinstitutionalists must continue to move beyond the underbrush clearing, beyond the pointing to infirmities in orthodoxy, beyond the call- ing for new paradigms, to the formulation of integrated, coherent, and relevant statements of their own basic position. Many have been and are now, of course, engaged in that effort.'0 This compendium is also directed to that end. The purpose of this article is to provide a synthetic and integrative identification of a neoinstitutional theory of social value. Specifically, the contributions of Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, Clarence Ayres, and J. Fagg Foster are examined. While the views on social value of these men obviously do not include all contributions, they appear to constitute an intelligible core around which others have built and/or are now building. Some particulars will doubtless already be familiar; a synthesis perhaps not yet so. Thorstein Veblen Nowhere, ironically, in the writings of Veblen will one find an explicitly formulated theory of social value. Indeed, in his failure to address directly</page><page sequence="3">A Social Value Theory 825 the initiation of institutions as an act of choice and thus confront the prob- lem of criteria of choice, Veblen seems actually to have been blocked by the value problem as such. There are repeated disclaimers of an interest in evaluation. About tastes, we are told, "there is no disputing."" "In making use of the term 'invidious,' it may perhaps be unnecessary to remark, that there is no intention to extol or deprecate, or to commend or deplore any of the phenomena which the word is used to characterize."'12 In the discussion of the institution of the leisure class, we are informed that "'right' and 'wrong' are of course here used without conveying any reflection as to what ought or ought not to be."''3 Whether or not Veblen expected these comments to be taken literally or seriously is interesting but of no consequence here. What is obvious is that Veblen, despite his blockage, was extensively and consistently en- gaged in evaluation. He was applying value theory in distinguishing be- tween institutions which exhibit "compatibility or incompatibility with the effective evolutionary process."'14 He distinguishes between institu- tions which are "imbecile" and those which are not-hardly a morally colorless term.'5 In point of fact, as is well known, much if not most of his scholarly work was directed to a fundamental critique of prevailing social customs and business practices and the theory that gave each its credibility. Veblen's inquiry is purposive; it is value laden. His value theory can be identified. Veblen's main contributions to a theory of social value are found pri- marily in his theory of instincts and in the familiar fundamental Veblenian distinction or dichotomy. Let us consider each briefly. Observing the fact of social change from his anthropological reading, Veblen, as did Karl Marx before him, sought inclusive and continuously applicable theory to explain that change. The evolutionary development of institutional forms appeared to him to parallel the Darwinian account of the evolutionary development of life forms. Veblen sought to identify those modes of thought and behavior which promote or provide for the continuity of culture and those that tend to impair or obstruct develop- mental cultural continuity. These supportive and inhibitive modes of thought and behavior are for Veblen reflective of "innate and persistent propensities of human nature."'6 The term instinct is used to designate these most basic human propensities. More modern usage would probably characterize them as basic urges or drives. Veblen does not use instinct to mean that people inherit predispositions to choose or act in particular ways. He understood cultural conditioning, habitual behavior, and the mores principle. Instincts are not the hereditary</page><page sequence="4">826 Marc R. Tool transmission of choice behavior; they are "native proclivities" which con- sciousness and intellect channel into culturally acknowledged modes of behavior.17 "Men take thought," but the "instinctual proclivities decide what they shall take thought of and how and to what effect."'8 The constructive or supportive proclivities for Veblen are "the instinct of workmanship," "parental bent," and "idle curiosity." The instinct of workmanship "occupies the interest with practical expedients, ways and means, devices and contrivances of efficiency and economy, proficiency, creative work and technological mastery of facts. Much of the functional content of the instinct of workmanship is a proclivity for taking pains ... a disposition to do the next thing and do it as well as may be."'9 The parental bent "appears to be an unselfish solicitude for the well- being of the incoming generation-a bias for the highest efficiency and fullest volume of life in the group, with particular drift to the future."20 The instinct of workmanship may be viewed as a "propensity to work out the ends which the parental bent makes worth while."92' Idle curiosity suggests that "men instinctively seek knowledge, and value it. The fact of this proclivity is well summed up in saying that men are by native gift actuated with an idle curiosity-'idle' in the sense that a knowledge of things is sought apart from any ulterior use of the knowl- edge so gained."22 But Veblen does not mean that knowledge so obtained will not be put to practical use. "The instinct of workmanship will un- avoidably incline men to turn to account, in a system of ways and means, whatever knowledge so becomes available."23 The outcome sought in such endeavor "is a theoretical organization, a logical articulation of things known, the lines of which must not be deflected by any consideration of expediency or convenience."24 Thus, the derivation of knowledge and the disposition to give it effective use in the pursuit of cultural continuity com- bine as propensities to initiate and guide social change along constructive channels. Juxtaposed as "contaminants" are equally omnipresent propensities which operate to thwart or obstruct the constructive propensities. These parallel and inhibitive proclivities are impulses to predaciousness and to emulation and invidious self-regard. The former are reflected in practices of exploit, prowess or mastery (warfare), ownership (material acquisi- tion), and in pecuniary control of industry. The latter are apparent in the anthropomorphism of primitive societies, in practices of conspicuous dis- play and conspicuous waste, and in leisure class elitism.25 Evident in the distinction between the constructive and contaminating instincts is an embryonic value principle. The former account for the con- tinuity of culture, contribute a net gain in comfort or in the fullness of life,</page><page sequence="5">A Social Value Theory 827 and should be encouraged. The latter sabotage that quest and should be discouraged. But Veblen's implicit value theory is apparent even more obviously in what has come to be called the Veblenian distinction or the fundamental Veblenian dichotomy. While it is formally offered as a descriptive or classi- fying principle, it is obviously and continuously used as an evaluative principle. In Leisure Class we are offered this descriptive statement: "Institutions -the economic structure-may be roughly distinguished into two classes or categories, according as they serve one or the other of two divergent purposes of economic life . .. they are institutions of acquisition or of production ... they are pecuniary or industrial institutions ... they are institutions serving either the invidious or the non-invidious economic interest."26 Veblen uses the term invidious to describe a "comparison of persons with a view to rating and grading them in respect of relative worth or value."27 But the forms or versions of the distinction extend well beyond the three mentioned above. Indeed, the distinction appears in all of Veblen's published works in one form or another; it was for him a general principle. Note the following diverse additional examples: salesmanship workmanship28 business industry29 ceremonial technological30 ownership production3' free income tangible performance32 vested interests common man33 sabotage community serviceability34 pecuniary employment industrial employment35 invidious emulation technological efficiency36 conscientious withdrawal of inordinately productive efficiency enterprise37 competitive advertising valuable information &amp; guidance38 business prosperity industrial efficiency39 And the foregoing does not exhaust the list. Entries in the left-hand col- umn refer to individuals, behaviors, or institutions which are different in kind from those in the right-hand column; the distinction is a dichotomy. The normative use of this set of distinctions can hardly be in doubt. "The interest of the community at large demands industrial efficiency and serviceability of the product, while the business interest of the concern as such demands vendibility of the product."40 It is scarcely morally color- less to contend that "all business sagacity" in the final analysis "reduces</page><page sequence="6">828 Marc R. Tool itself ... to a judicious use of sabotage." "Captains of industry" through owners' discretion give "authoritative permission" and "authoritative limitation" to the industrial process. It is Veblen's lament that such author- ity is not used with "an eye single" to produce the "largest and most ser- viceable output of goods and services, or to the most economical use of the country's material resources and man-power, regardless of pecuniary consequences." "The volume and serviceability of the output must wait unreservedly on the very particular pecuniary question of what quantity and what degree of serviceability will yield the largest net return in terms of price."'41 Veblen characterizes a "vested interest" as a "prescriptive right to get something for nothing."42 He sees the objective of competitive advertising as the establishment of "differential monopolies resting on popular con- viction" which are of "slight if any immediate service to the community."43 Can these observations be considered devoid of normative content? Ob- viously not. In sum, Veblen's fundamental concern is to further the "life process taken impersonally," to enhance "human life on the whole," to achieve "the largest and most serviceable output of goods and services." His theory of instincts indicates which sorts of basic impulses are contributive to or inhibitive of that quest. His fundamental "distinction" identifies institu- tions and behaviors which are supportive of or destructive of that quest. Veblen applies value theory; his concept of what ought to be is evident. John Dewey Dewey addresses the social value problem directly and, contrary to Veblen, finds that "instead of there being no disputing about tastes, they are the one thing worth disputing about, if by 'dispute' is signified discus- sion involving reflective inquiry."44 Dewey's distinctive contribution is his formulation of an instrumental logic as the core of scientific social inquiry and of its application to the realm of social value. We here sample that contribution.45 Dewey sets the context for his own value theory by attempting to re- move two conventional blockages to value inquiry. The first contention to be refuted is the idea that judgmental matters have no evidential or em- pirical content. They are alleged to be expressions of emotions or feelings states and not amenable to inquiry. Dewey contends, on the contrary, that "valuations exist in fact and are capable of empirical observation so that propositions about them are empirically verifiable. What individuals and</page><page sequence="7">A Social Value Theory 829 groups hold dear or prize and the grounds upon which they prize them are capable, in principle, of ascertainment."46 Since all social choices require the application of criteria, and since choices produce consequences, one may reflect upon the character of conseqences emerging from the use of a criterion and thus upon the propriety of the criterion itself. Value judg- ments are brought within social inquiry. The second and related contention to be refuted is the alleged neces- sary acceptance of the positive-normative dichotomy.47 This formulation presumes a fundamental divorcement between questions of "is" and ques- tions of "ought," between means and ends, between that which is observ- able in a descriptive sense and that which is evaluational and judgmental. Positivistic analysis employs an epistemology of scientific cause-effect reasoning and evidential demonstration. Normative analysis employs an epistemology of metaphysical or subjectivistic reasoning; it is noncausally knowable. Positive and normative have no common content; they are mu- tually exclusive, it is argued. Dewey rejects this dichotomy on several grounds, the principle one of which perhaps concerns the logic of inquiry.48 Inquiry for Dewey is a search for observable regularities in a continuum of evidently knowable phenomena. By whatever caption-cause-effect connections, means- consequence connections, or means-ends connections-it is clear that causes or means are determinant of effects, consequences, or ends in the continuum of inquiry. Moreover, "effects are also causes.... Nothing happens which is final in the sense that it is not part of an ongoing stream of events."49 Thus, ends attained function as means for the attainment of further ends or ends-in-view. The designation by the inquirer of means and ends within the process of inquiry itself is a necessary condition of their serving as operational hypotheses, as instrumentalities in the inquiry process. Ends which are conceived a priori, through nonevidential or ex- traexperiential epistemologies, cannot function instrumentally. A social value principle must be found that is internal to or consistent with the instrumental logic of social inquiry. We suggest, without elaboration, that Dewey rejects evaluation employing tradition, desires, given tastes, util- ity, metaphysical essences, mystic power, and the like, because they can- not function as instrumentalities. Finally, what is (are) Dewey's principle(s) of social value? What does he offer in lieu of deference to utility and/or tradition? One response which is directly tied to the means-ends analysis is the following: "The generalized ideal and standard of economy-efficiency which operates in every advanced art and technology is equivalent, upon</page><page sequence="8">830 Marc R. Tool analysis, to the conception of means that are constituents of ends attained and of ends that are usuable as means to further ends."50 Economy-efficiency for Dewey is a criterion the significance of which is established in its problem-solving role: In all inquiry, even the most completely scientific, what is proposed as a conclusion (the end-in-view in that inquiry) is evaluated as to its worth on the ground of its ability to resolve the problem presented by the condi- tions under investigation. There is no a priori standard for determining the value of a proposed solution in concrete cases.51 Ends-in-view are appraised or valued as good or bad on the ground of their serviceability in the direction of behavior dealing with states of affairs found to be objectionable because of some lack or conflict in them. They are appraised as fit or unfit, proper or improper, right or wrong, on the ground of their requiredness in accomplishing this end.52 But the foregoing does not suffice. Admittedly, a criterion must arise from within inquiry, and procedurally it must function to resolve the prob- lematic situation, but the substantive character of the criterion itself is so far largely undisclosed. Some substantive content may be suggested. In its logical form, Dewey's criterion may be identified as to act so as to "increase the meaning of present experience."53 To increase the meaning of present experience is to understand the way in which present experience connects and relates to past experience and will relate and connect with future experience. To attain meaning is to place in appropriate context. Increased knowledge of origins of experience and increased perception of consequences inform judgment and convey meaning. To expand such comprehensions of connections, to increase meaning, is to multiply the possibilities for effective action and participation. Such participation takes on meaning when the way in which that participation relates to the social whole is understood. "Morality is a continuing process, not a fixed achieve- ment. Morals means growth of conduct in mleaning; at least it means that kind of expansion in meaning which is consequent upon observations of the conditions and outcome of conduct. It is all one with growing."54 Moreover, "in the largest sense of the word, morals is education. It is learning the meaning of what we are about and employing that meaning in action. The good, satisfaction, 'end,' of growth of present action in shades and scope of meaning is the only good within our control, and the only one, accordingly, for which responsibility exists. The rest is luck, fortune."55 If "present meaning in action" is an identifiable "good," and if the en- hancement of the attainment of such meaning is a function of education,</page><page sequence="9">A Social Value Theory 831 of "learning the meaning of what we are about and employing that mean- ing in action," it follows that judgment among alternative modes of social behavior may be made in terms of the extent to which they facilitate or retard the achievement of meaning by the community at large. Thus, any- thing obstructive of the continuity of the inquiry process as that process is utilized to enhance the achievement of meaning would be "bad." To im- pair opportunities for the attainment of increments in meaning is to pro- duce consequences of a kind which make resolution of problems more difficult: To impair meaning is to impair comprehension, which impairs problem resolution. Closely allied with the foregoing criterion is another formulation that perhaps is more expressly and obviously a social value premise. This vari- ant may fairly be captioned the "common welfare" criterion. That which furthers the common welfare is what ought to be in Dewey's view. But no doubt hundreds of scolars have advocated that judgments be based on some notion of welfare; indeed, a version appears in the U.S. Constitution. Dewey's position can be differentiated from other seemingly similar views. The substance of his conception of the "common welfare" is approximated in the following: The conception of the common good, of general well-being is a criterion which demands the full development of individuals in their distinctive individuality, not a sacrifice of them to some alleged vague larger good under the plea that it is "social." Only when individuals have initiative, in- dependence of judgment, flexibility, fullness of experience, can they act so as to enrich the lives of others and only in this way can a truly common welfare be built up. The other side of this statement, of the moral criterion, is that individuals are free to develop, to contribute and to share, only as social conditions break down walls of privilege and of monopolistic pos- session.56 The denial of social and economic participation on grounds of status, "privilege," or "monopolistic possession" is an unwarranted judgment, according to Dewey. The corollary political criterion for the common welfare is the "demo- cratic ideal." For democracy signifies, on one side, that every individual is to share in the duties and rights belonging to control of social affairs, and, on the other side, that social arrangements are to eliminate those external ar- rangements of status, birth, wealth, sex, etc., which restrict the oppor- tunity of each individual for full development of himself. On the indi- vidual side, it takes as the criterion of social organization and of law and government release of the potentialities of individuals. On the social side,</page><page sequence="10">832 Marc R. Tool it demands cooperation in place of coercion, voluntary sharing in a process of mutual give and take, instead of authority imposed from above.... It serves ... as [a] basis for criticism of institutions as they exist and of plans of betterment.57 The concept of democracy itself, when conceived as the noninvidious determination of social policy, serves for Dewey as a criterion of judgment in choosing social policy. The commonality of the above with elements of Veblen's fundamental distinction is apparent. Dewey's "walls of privilege and monopolistic possession" or "arrangements of status, birth, wealth, sex, etc.," presumably would exemplify what Veblen calls ceremonial or invidious behavior and attitudes. It is the position of Veblen and Dewey (the former implicitly, the latter explicitly) that judgments based upon these sorts of grounds are evidently demonstrable as erroneous. And whether the obverse of these obstructive judgments be viewed as "indus- trial efficiency" or as the "release of human potentialities," each is offered as a criterion with which to choose adjustments in institutional structure to resolve problems. Finally, how do we distill from these expressions of "economy- efficiency," increasing "the meaning of experience," pursuit of the "com- mon welfare," and the "democratic ideal" a common and intelligible referent for Dewey's value principle? Perhaps the following will serve as a satisfactory approximation: Maximize opportunities for instrumentally effective social and individual noninvidious development. Although, as has been evident, the value theory of Veblen and Dewey correlates well in many respects, it remains for Clarence Ayres to provide a comprehensive integration. Clarence Ayres Ayres's singular achievement of imaginatively combining Dewey's in- strumental logic and instrumental value theory with Veblen's evolutionary analysis of the economic process provides a stellar theoretical monument to his own thesis that new knowledge derives from fresh combinations of prior knowledge. If Veblen in his day "compelled a whole generation of economists to search their hearts lest the truth be not in them,"58 and if Dewey was partially successful in persuading "his fellow philosophers to have done with the building of sand piles on the shores of life" and to "come inland to help build habitations fit for men,"59 surely Ayres and his fellow institutionalists are, in these days, playing the David to the Goliath of the conventional wisdom. Ayres well understood the power of ideas to affect the course of events.60</page><page sequence="11">A Social Value Theory 833 Others have recently commented on Ayres's remarkable breadth of vision and scholarship, his recourse to many disciplines for insight and evidence.6' Here, we focus solely and briefly upon his social value theory -its underpinnings and context and its fundamental differences with more conventional views. Consider first his differences with conventional views as a general case. Ayres decries the "pestilence of moral agnosticism" and the ethical rela- tivism which undergirds it.62 This value avoidance, says Ayres, arises from three cultural aspects.63 (1) "Scientific separatism" has compartmental- ized knowledge and experience and delimited the impact of new knowl- edge on cultural convention. Old customary value beliefs often remain unchallenged. (2) "Economic individualism" extolled the primacy and efficiency of the self-regulating market system and deferred to the hedonis- tic, utilitarian value reflected in commercial and consumer behavior. (3) "Cultural relativism" asserted the absence of any "general or transcultural criterion by which cultural patterns can be judged." The traditions of the culture itself provide the only warrant or sanction for behavior-what is, is right. "To each his own," and then no one "can say naught agin' him." In combination, says Ayres, these theories "destroy all genuine moral leadership."64 Ayres also cannot abide ethical absolutists' position on value, whether rooted in metaphysical or supernatural sources, or in materialistic certi- tudes of race, class, and the like. But we cannot pursue this matter here. Ayres's value theory also represents a fundamental rejection of the spe- cific value assumptions of orthodox economics as a specific case of "moral agnosticism." Building on Veblen's essays in the Place of Science which cut away at the roots of orthodoxy-essays which explain the taxonomic, teleological, tautological, and hedonistic qualities of neoclassical analysis -Ayres directly attacks the value assumptions of price theory. In price theory, price (value in exchange) is a measure of and an evi- dential surrogate for utility (value in use). Utility is the ability of goods to satisfy hedonistic wants. The maximization of utility is the inclusive goal of economic activity. The real worth and hence significance of the market process is therewith identified.65 But the attribution of real worth and hence significance to the maxi- mization of utility through market phenomena is for Ayres wholly con- jectural. There is no communicable referential content, for the concept of utility is peculiarly open to criticism on the ground of tautology. Indeed, it was for years the chief focus of such criticism. It is all very well to say that utility is the want-satisfying quality, whatever wants may be. But if we have no way of knowing, let alone measuring,</page><page sequence="12">834 Marc R. Tool wants, how can we know utility-let alone measure it? It is all very well to say that price is the measure of utility. But if we have no independent measure of utility, (and we have none), that only means that we have equated price and utility by definition. Such being the case, nothing can be inferred from the correspondence.66 Accordingly, Ayres is unable to find meaning or significance in the ortho- dox use of utility as a value principle. He urges that we look elsewhere. Some underpinnings for Ayres's value theory may now be noted. From Dewey, Ayres incorporates and utilizes extensively the means-ends-means continuum and rejects the means-ends dichotomy.67 In addition, he insists on the abandonment of "sand piles on the shores of life," that is, of views of value grounded in nonexperiential or nonevidential sources. With Dewey, he insists that philosophical value must be derived from and be relevant to the factual and demonstrable experience of human life.68 The locus of social value for Ayres is the social process, more particu- larly, the "technological continuum" of that process. Ayres's alternative to mores nihilism or ethical relativism and ethical absolutism is to be found in the existential facts of human experience. "We know that social develop- ment is a continuous process, and it is in terms of this continuity . .. that value and welfare can be quite objectively defined and understood. For not only is the social process a continuous one in the chronological sense; on the technological side it is a logical continuum, a true progression each item of which implies succeeding items by the same process by which each has been itself derived from preceding items in the series. It is this tech- nological continuum which is the locus of truth and value."69 By "technological continuum" Ayres means substantially what Dewey meant by the "continuum of inquiry."70 Its significance as the locus of social and economic value derives from "the logical significance of the instrumental continuum."'7' "Truth. . . derives from the use of instru- ments, tools, and instrumentally manipulated materials. The very word, 'truth,' is in effect a synonym for continuity and the continuity it postulates is that of instruments and tools-that is to say, technology.... Such is also the meaning of value. In the same sense the word value is a synonym for continuity, and the continuity of which it is a synonym is technological continuity. 'Value' means continuity literally; and that is its sole mean- ing."72 In Ayres's last major work, he reaffirms that in his view "it is the dissociation of truth and value that defines the moral crisis of the twentieth century. 73 As has been implicit in the foregoing, Ayres's value principle may now be identified as the furtherance of the "life process" of mankind. "When we judge a thing to be good or bad, or an action to be right or wrong, what</page><page sequence="13">A Social Value Theory 835 we mean is that, in our opinion, the thing or act in question will, or will not, serve to advance the life process insofar as we can invision it."74 Referential content is provided for this value principle by Ayres's use of Veblen's fundamental distinction. For Ayres, the distinction usually takes one of the following forms: technology versus institutions, instru- mental versus invidious, or science versus ceremony. Perhaps the most meaningful and frequent version poses technological (instrumental) ver- sus ceremonial (invidious) behavior.75 For Ayres, these are "humanity's two aspects."76 But as his students are well aware, Ayres provides a somewhat more particularistic, if not reductionistic, interpretation of technology than did Veblen or Dewey. Ayres's classic statement in The Theory of Economic Progress defines technology as "organized skill."77 "All acts of skill in- volve the use of tools"; "all technology . . . is progressive"; "the develop- mental character of technology ... is in the character of tools"; "inven- tions are combinations of previously existing devices"; "these combina- tions are physical not less than ideational"; "the more tools there are the greater the number of combinations"; "the tool combination principle is indeed a law of progress."78 Almost two decades later this position re- mains substantially unchanged.79 Ceremonial patterns of behavior for Ayres (the second of humanity's two aspects) are distinguished by two universal traits. One is that "dis- tinctions of rank and status ape differences of technological competence." Rank is presumed to coincide with "technological reality."80 "Ceremonial adequacy" means attribution of competence by ritual not by technological demonstration. The second trait of ceremonial behavior is its mores base; it is defined by and given sanction in the mores.81 The mores define status patterns and functions, and these differ depending on people's rank, age, sex, and the like. Cultures prescribe what is right and what is wrong. Per- sons gain "mystic potency" by "scrupulous observance" of the mores. Status systems stipulate difference in mystic potency and order or array persons based on these alleged differences. In contrast with technological activity, which is inherently developmen- tal, ceremonial activity is "static, resistant to and inhibitive of change"; it is "past-preserving."82 In a sweeping summation, Ayres contends that "the history of the hu- man race is that of a perpetual opposition of these forces, the dynamic force of technology continually making for change, and the static force of ceremony-status, mores, and legendary belief-opposing change.83 Ayres seems to have retained this interpretation through his more re- cent work. Technological patterns "are predominantly working, opera-</page><page sequence="14">836 Marc R. Tool tional, tool-skill relationships."84 Ceremonial patterns are still seen as "predominantly status relationships of power and subservience, arbitrarily established by 'legitimate' birth, authentically performed ceremonies, and the like."85 It follows, obviously, that for Ayres, technological (instrumental) be- havior furthers the life process of mankind; ceremonial (invidious) behav- ior retards or obstructs the life process of mankind. Here is a value princi- ple grounded in evidence and instrumental logic. J. Fagg Foster One of Ayres's intellectual progeny, Fagg Foster,86 was recently de- scribed as "one of the last great practitioners of the oral tradition in eco- nomic scholarship."87 That characterization is appropriate. Foster has spent his professional life seeking to reformulate the fundamental prin- ciples of economics on the Veblen-Dewey-Ayres base and to communi- cate that reformulation to successive groups of students through lectures, addresses, and monographs. Although there is not available a definitive publication of Foster's position,88 his profound and substantial impact on his students and on scholarship on the "American contribution" is rou- tinely acknowledged in professional circles of institutional economists. Comments here will be confined to his formulation of the theory of so- cial value and the theory of institutional adjustment which incorporates his value theory. Hopefully, this presentation will reflect Foster's quest for coherence, pattern, and precision in neoinstitutional thought. The presen- tation which follows is an ordered sequence of propositions. Space con- straints preclude elaboration, but the foregoing commentary on Veblen, Dewey, and Ayres provides much of the needed background. Consider Foster's formulation of the theory of social value.89 (1) Economics is "concerned with the process of providing the means of life and experience." This process is coextensive with human life; it is an omnipresent functional category of human activity. (2) The inclusive economic function (provision of real income) and all subsidiary functions (for example, production of food and fiber, edu- cation of the young) are organized and given effect through structural institutions. Institutions are defined as "prescribed patterns of correlated activity and attitudes among groups of persons." The functions are con- tinuous and developmental; the institutional structures are discontinuous and displacemental. (3) The purpose of economic inquiry is "to explain the institutional determination of the level and character [and distribution] of real income,"</page><page sequence="15">A Social Value Theory 837 to conduct "rational inquiry into the institutions through which man pro- vides himself with the means of life and experience." (4) The reason for such inquiry, its claim to significance, derives from its relevance or applicability to real problems facing real people, to eco- nomic problems such as unemployment, inflation, poverty, and discrimina- tion. Social and economic inquiry is purposive; it is directed to problem solving. (5) The mode of economic inquiry must be scientific in the instru- mental logic sense. Sought are causal explanations of phenomena under review. Inquiry is a continuum in the means-consequence-means sense and in the means-determine-ends sense. It utilizes the interdependencies of deductive and inductive modes, of rationalist and empiricist models. (6) The outcome of inquiry is reliable knowledge-increments to the stock and flow of causally comprehended regularities in existential phys- ical and social phenomena. Applied to the productive process as tech- nology, such knowledge-technology is at once the basic source of the perceptions of differences between what is and what ought to be and is the basic resource on which scholars and the community must draw creatively to adjust institutions to resolve problems. (7) Economic problems are instances of breakdown, termination, im- pairment, disorder, discrimination, or obsolescence in the performance of economic functions by economic institutions. Problems are perceived as the difference between what is and what ought to be. Problem solutions must take the form of institutional adjustment, of modification of those institutions (or parts thereof) which are causally responsible for the im- pairment in the production and distribution of real income. "The eco- nomic general theory must be the theory of institutional adjustment." (8) All institutions perform two different kinds of functions. One is an instrumental function which provides for the full and continuous appli- cation of knowledge-technology in pursuit of the primary purpose or ac- tivity for which the institution exists (for example, generating energy, providing transport, communicating word and image). The other is a ceremonial function, which provides for the creation or maintenance of status, power, rank, privilege, and/or tradition, or of invidious differentia- tion on grounds of race, creed, color, sex, and the like. The resolution of a problem consists of the reduction or removal of ceremonial behavior and attitudes and the creation or extension of instrumental behavior and attitudes. (9) Since problems consist of institutional malfunctioning, impair- ment, or breakdown, and since the restoration of effectual functioning requires the choice among institutional options, the criterion of choice</page><page sequence="16">838 Marc R. Tool must be "independent of any particular institution." Structural givens (public or private ownership of property, for example) cannot be used as criteria of choice without committing tautological error. "Institutions are constituted of habits but they are not determined by habits." People create institutions which become habitual. In creating structure, a prin- ciple of choice, a criterion of judgment, must be employed. "What is" can- not be "what is right," or there would be no problem. The mores encapsule value judgments; they cannot constitute a principle of values for problem solving. (10) Having located social value, following Ayres, in the social and technological processes and the continuity thereof, the specific identifica- tion of the value principle becomes both necessary and possible. The only value principle which conforms to the continuity and substance of instru- mental logic, which itself possesses processional characteristics, which is noninstitutional in form, which is consistent with the evidence of problem solving, and which is continuously applicable to problem solving is "the continuity and instrumental efficiency of the social process." (11) The instrumental efficiency criterion does not specify direction; it does not point toward some utopian state or ideological recipe of insti- tutional structure. The principle does not lead an economy "down the road" to an ism. The test is not conformity with or movement toward a preconceived set of institutions-as with capitalism, socialism, or com- munism. This suggests why isms do not apply and why all economies are always mixed economies. (12) The instrumental efficiency criterion is a value principle which does specify condition. But it does not validate a condition of invidious differentiation-of efficiency in preserving privilege or according status. It is not a matter of efficiency in the exercise of power over others, denigra- tion of persons, or the preservation of tradition. On the contrary, it vali- dates a condition of efficiency in the use of warrantable knowledge in the carrying on of the instrumental, noninvidious functions of institutions. (13) The instrumental efficiency criterion has a constancy of meaning over time. It will apply to the whole or any part of the social and eco- nomic processes. It displays real and unimpaired continuity. It satisfies all requirements for truth. It is the only criterion which has produced or can produce solutions for real problems in the only sense in which "solution" can have a credible meaning, that is, structural change (validated by this criterion) has removed the human incidences of the breakdown or dis- ruptions in the production and distribution of real income. Consider, finally, Foster's theory of institutional adjustment. His re- formulation of the fundamental principles of economics prominently in-</page><page sequence="17">A Social Value Theory 839 corporates "the most obtrusive of the continuing and inclusive factors in the process of solving problems."90 These "factors" are the three principles of institutional adjustment. These set the terms of and limitations upon the adjustment of institutions to resolve problems. They incorporate the value theory described above. (1) The Principle of Technological Determination. Instrumentally efficient problem solving requires a sufficient availability of reliable knowl- edge. While full knowledge in any sense is never in hand, it is still true that data, institutional and noninstitutional, are required sufficient to perceive a difference between is and ought, to grasp the determinants of a problem, and to permit the formulation of institutional alternatives. Once such knowledge becomes available and is widely known, however, a community cannot "unknow" it, cannot disclaim its understanding. That understand- ing provides a continuing pressure or prod for the pursuit of instrumen- tally more efficient arrangements of institutional structure so long as the understood problems remain. The availability of reliable knowledge will permit the determination of whatever level of instrumentally efficient per- formance of instrumental functions is considered tolerable or desirable by those affected. (2) The Principle of Recognized Interdependence. The ability of a people to understand and accept the contemplated institutional adjust- ment is also a limiting condition on social and economic change. Institu- tions are constituted of social habits. Change in structure obviously must be initiated as a choice or judgment to change habits. Those affected by the change must comprehend and themselves choose or agree to in- voke altered behavior or attitudes-modify habitual modes-or nothing changes substantively. In choosing, people must be able to see themselves functioning normally and effectively after the adjustment in their interde- pendencies with other people and other institutions. The recognition of such interdependencies permits recorrelation and new coordination of instrumental activity. This principle "specifies the pattern of understand- ing which must be accomplished in order to solve any particular social problem." The foregoing suggests why revolutions from above typically fail effec- tively to rewrite living and working rules. According to this principle, only evolutions from below are likely to succeed. Those whose behavior is to be revised must themselves understand the need for it, concur with it, and participate in it if the change is actually to occur. This is a substantial part of the argument for democratic participation in social and economic policy making. (3) The Principle of Minimal Dislocation. "All institutional modifica-</page><page sequence="18">840 Marc R. Tool tions must be capable of being incorporated into the remainder of the institutional structure." This principle sets limits of adjustment with refer- ence to scope, area, or extent of adjustment and with regard to timing and rate of introduction. All structural change is dislocative. Contemplated change could be in- voked with reference to rate and extent so as to intrude upon or disrupt as little as possible other instrumental functioning in nonproblematic but interrelated and affected institutions. If adjustments are more extensive than people think is needed or necessary (given the first two principles), and if nonproblematic areas are adversely affected in the instrumental efficiency sense, the change will be resisted and may be aborted. Effective change must then await a more adequate recognition of the constraints and a revision of proposed changes in observance of this principle. This principle explains in part why proposals for comprehensive re- ordering of entire political economies usually fail in the achievement of their aims. No people can stop and start over; none can wholly or even mostly reorder the interdependent patterns of belief and behavior which correlate their relations with others. Change must proceed piecemeal. On the other hand, if the other two principles are observed, institutional ad- justment may be surprisingly rapid. Especially is this so if the problems are extensive and severe. For Foster, the instrumental efficiency theory of social value and the principles of institutional adjustment together provide the core of an alternative to orthodoxy and the core, then, of a restatement of the funda- mental principles of economics. Foster, like his precursers, finds neo- classical price theory devoid of a general theory of the economic process. Foster and his mentors have attempted to provide the "theoretical formu- lation" of "the economic life process" for which Veblen called. Summary and Synthesis Veblen, although blocked by value analysis itself as an inquiry problem, nevertheless provides rudimentary value constructs and makes extensive application of them throughout his writing. Dewey moves the value problem back into the area of social inquiry and ties value identification to that of truth seeking. He addresses the value problem directly and clears away obstructions to its consideration, but his identification of a value principle is not sufficiently precise or applicable. Ayres ties the Veblenian distinction and instrumental logic together, identifies the locus of value in the social process and the technological con-</page><page sequence="19">A Social Value Theory 841 tinuum, and mounts an assault on the particulars of price theory from this base. Foster, building on all three, provides a more specific identification of the value, the criterion of judgment; in the theory of institutional adjust- ment he reformulates, on this value base, fundamental principles of eco- nomics. These set the terms and define the constraints for the application of value theory to real economic problems. The following synthetic statements inevitably represent a selection of elements, both explicit and implicit, from the four contributors discussed.Y9 Others would, of course, distill a different residue, but the significance of this synthesis is to provide constructs which are manageable and useful for inquiry and conduct. That is the test. A criterion of social value is "the continuity and instrumental effective- ness of recreating community non-invidiously." This is a criterion with which to choose among alternative economic and social policies formed as institutional options. It is general in its relevance to the social process, to the functional components of that process (economy, polity), and to choices among institutional forms which organize that process. The reso- lution of problems compels the employment of this principle of value. In this value principle, "continuity" is grounded in the fact that there is no human history except that of evolutionary development of human organisms and of the culture such persons create and preserve. The prin- ciple asserts the obvious as an "ought"-that the continuance of human life is the first and primary charge to any community. Providing for con- tinuity implies, beyond the obvious, an awareness of conditions which positively foster human life and exhibit a solicitous concern for human life. Recall Veblen's parental bent. Especially included is a deference to human potential and developmental capabilities. The social process is the locus of value. "Instrumental effectiveness" incorporates the idea that reliable knowl- edge is instrumental to an understanding of social reality and should be employed efficiently to relevant areas of human problems and experience. Reliable knowledge includes science and technology. It includes the whole fund or stock of evidentially grounded, logically evolved recognitions of means-consequence connections emerging incrementally as a knowledge continuum. It is the aggregative product of tool and idea contributions and combinations running back beyond written records. New knowledge is derived from recast or reconstituted old knowledge. This value principle encompasses the use of such knowledge in the identification and resolution of real economic problems.</page><page sequence="20">842 Marc R. Tool Reference to instrumental effectiveness conditions and constrains the use of reliable knowledge to that which is pertinent and compatible with the remainder of the principle. At issue is the appropriateness of means chosen to serve ends-in-view, recognizing that means determine ends-in- view. One does not repair a watch with a sledge hammer, create a depres- sion to cope with inflation, or enhance political democracy with campaign sabotage. "Re-creating community" makes clear that human life is feasible only in a context of culture. Individuals are born into communities as going concerns with language, custom, and order already affirmed. Institutions pattern lives. Re-creating community means reconstituting the structural fabric of that social order by utilizing effectively the stock of human wis- dom. Since all already reside in community, the task is to re-create. Finally, "noninvidiously" speaks to the character of community just mentioned. Veblen's usage of "invidious" obtains. Human differences of race, sex, ethnicity, color, wealth, ownership, rank, age, status, power, and the like, have been and are being used as invidious indices of relative worth of individuals. In this value principle, the invidious use of any dis- tinction is, so far as is possible, to be avoided in the application of reliable knowledge to the re-creation of community to assure continuity. This prin- ciple affirms the inherent potential and ultimate worth of human beings. Noninvidiousness as a value component permits qualitative judgments to be made. Does a proposed structural change enhance the dignity and sense of self-worth which arises from having discretion in one's own life? Does it foster the ability to think critically and coherently? Does it extend meaningful and popular participation? Or does it erode or destroy by denigration, discrimination, and disenfranchisement? Where the latter occurs, continuity and community suffer. As Ayres often remarked, to cripple a part is to cripple the whole of a community to that degree. "We are members one of another" in fact. Participatory democracy is a corol- lary of the instrumental effectiveness theory of value. It may offer surcease from "the pestilence of moral agnosticism" and other judgmental ills. Notes 1.
