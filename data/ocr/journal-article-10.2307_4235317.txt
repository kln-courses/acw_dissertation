<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES AND COMMENTARIES THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL SCIENCE: PARADIGMS OF PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, AND POLITICS Glendon Schubert Department of Political Science University of Hawaii-Manoa Porteus 640-2424 Maile Way Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 Glendon Schubert presented the following article as a paper at the first "Dialogues Panel" at the 1982 meeting of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences, Denver, Colorado, September 1982. The commentators were Hayward Alker, Jr., and Dina Zinnes. In the dialogue panel concept, different intellectual perspectives are brought to bear on an issue of common concern. ?The Editor Paradigmatic Change in Natural and Political Science Politics is an aspect of both cultural and biological modes of behavior among humans, and by definition, political evolution is in part a component of cultural evolution (Lumsden and Wilson, 1982; Corning, 1973; Masters, 1970). From a biological perspective our concern is with the phylogeny of political science as an academic disci- pline, which involves the academic ideology of the pro- fession (Schubert, 1967b) and hence the political behavior of political scientists. The Prescience of Physics and Politics Many political scientists would date the inception of the systematic study of politics no later than Aristotle, and this is a standpoint with which I am not entirely unsympathetic (Schubert, 1973). However, for present purposes I shall compare the state of development of contemporary po- litical science with that of medieval physical sci- ence?which also, of course, can and did claim a direct affinity with Aristotle. Political science has been an orga- nized academic discipline for little more than a century, irrespective of whether we attribute its nineteenth-century origins to Francis Lieber or John Burgess (Haddow, 1939; Somit and Tanenhaus, 1967). We can therefore skip over the intervening twenty-two centuries since Aristotle during which no noteworthy changes took place in either political theory or political methodology as applied in the system- atic, empirical, scientific study of politics. According to Crombie (1961:13), a biologically trained historian of science: a quantified science . . . comprises not only quantified procedures but also quantified explanatory concepts, each applicable to the other within a theoretical sys- tem. The development of a science then takes place through a dialogue between its theories and its pro- cedures, the former offering an exploration of the expected world through predictions and explanations made by means of technical procedures, and the latter confronting these theoretical expectations with the test of quantified data. A dialogue of this kind requires that both sides should speak the same language. We are so familiar with the close and precise adaptation of conceptual and procedural language to each other in modern physics that it may come as a surprise to find au- thentic scientific systems in which this is not the case. Yet we do not have to look very far to find examples. In the contemporary social sciences and in psychol- ogy, they are notorious. . . . The main interest of medieval physics in this context seems to me to be that it provides the earliest example in the develop- ment of modern science in which we can study the state of affairs when the dialogue between concepts and procedures was incomplete or absent. Then we can study the difference it made when clear and exact communication was opened, as it was in the seven- teenth century. For physics of course, Crombie's point is well-taken; for political science, any such event can only fall in a future rather than a past century. However, as we shall see, for</page><page sequence="2">98 many political purposes the future ought to be viewed as accessible to cognition, at least as usefully as is the past. Crombie's analysis (1961:29-30) of medieval physics suggests some striking parallels with many of the most conspicuous characteristics of contemporary political science. For example: The primary internal, intellectual need felt by medieval natural philosophers [and for political science today, substitute "political philosophers"] was for rational, theoretical clarification and understanding rather than for knowledge acquired through observation. This need arose in a desire to understand rationally and clarify (a) the features of cosmogony and cosmology accepted as having been revealed [then, as Crombie implies, "by the grace of God," a presupposition that obtained notoriously not only for Galileo and Newton but subsequently for Darwin and Mendel as well; al- though for political science, the non-Creationists among us would substitute "by modern natural sci- ence" as the source of the revelation. As I remarked earlier (Schubert, 1976:165) in regard to antiquarian Greek science, political scientists now "would not wish to rely upon either Hippocrates' or Aristotle's knowledge of human anatomy or medicine"], and (b) the system of natural philosophy presented in the Latin translations [then; now, English or some other modern language] of Aristotle and the other Greek and the Arabic philosophers and mathematicians. . . This theoretical emphasis in intellectual interests was supported and maintained by the aims, content, and methods of the education provided by the medi- eval [for physics; for political science, modern] uni- versities, where the basis of both the arts course and of the higher courses in theology [then; sociology now], law [then and now], and medicine [then; now political science] was the making of a critical study and commentary on theoretical problems raised by standard texts. ... As a result, medieval physics [like political science to date] never escaped its Aristote- lian framework. Hence, what contemporary political science has in com- mon with sixteenth-century physics is that it has not yet developed a disciplinary paradigm. Like sixteenth-century physics, it is prescientific in its theory and methodology. Crombie spoke at a conference that convened in sub- stantial measure on the initiative of a political scientist, Pendleton Herring, who acted in an institutional role that was launched six decades ago due substantially to the academic-political efforts of Charles Merriam, a political scientist whose exploits in political theory and praxis alike need no retelling before the present audience (but see Karl, 1974; and Schubert, forthcoming/b, "Introduction"). Merriam's design (1921, 1925) for a new science of politics has been on our profession's agenda throughout the greater part of the twentieth century. His students have provided the leading role models for political scientists for more than two generations (Somit and Tanenhaus, 1967: 113), including our profession's only Nobel laureate (even if he did earn it for work in organizational theory after having made a quantum leap of sorts to industrial man- agement, barely half a dozen years after completing his political science doctorate at Chicago). Furthermore, the Charles Merriam Professor at the University of Illinois is among those joined in this panel this afternoon. It is the more ironic, therefore, that it remains not merely possible but justifiable to assert that as a science, political science is best characterized as a preclassical or antiquarian discipline (and cf. White, 1980, and 1982b). What follows is an attempt to explicate the grounds and the process for further developing the study of politics as a more modern science. Natural Science Macroparadigms During the past generation no work in the philosophy of science has influenced political science more than Thomas Kuhn's (1962) theory of paradigm change in science. (For a precis of the theory, see Landau, 1972:56- 57.) Apart from its other merits, no doubt the denotation in the book's title of "revolution" as the subject of study was an attractive feature. In any case during the sixties (as Landau, 1972:57-58 has recounted), a panoply of our profession's leaders leaped agilely on Kuhn's bandwagon and strove mightily to cling to his coattails?albeit with indifferent success. Their problem is our problem, as we shall see below. Moreover, whatever controversy Kuhn's thesis may have engendered during the sixties both within and beyond the overlapping fields of the history and philosophy of science (and see the postscript to Kuhn's second edition, 1970; and Landau, 1972, ch. 2), there can be no cavil about the pertinence of his theory to an ex- planation of paradigm change in the first of the epochal shifts to which we now turn. For both physics and biology, three principal eras can be distinguished from antiquity to the present. The fourth century B.C. is a convenient marker for what we con- ventionally interpret (given the differential survival of writings) as the climax of Greek biology, physics, philos- ophy, and politics, as represented in works attributed to Aristotle and the Academy in which he was trained (al- though mathematicians such as Euclid and Archimedes as well as the apogee of Greek physics came slightly later, see Sambursky, 1975:37-45). Antiquarian physical sci- ence persisted for two millenia. It was finally displaced by classical physic*:, which began in the sixteenth century with the work of Copernicus and Galileo, but which is now identified principally with Newton's work in the last third of the seventeenth century, and which terminated as a par- adigm with Einstein's major work, in the first two decades of the present century. Elementary particle, subatomic physics began in 1900 with Max Planck's initial postula- tion of the quantum concept and competed for several decades with neoclassical (i.e., relativity theory) physics (Gamow, 1966). Einstein's theory, like Newton's, is de- terministic and objective; quantum theory is indeterminate, subjective, and probabilistic. Nevertheless, the paradigm that has dominated both theoretical and applied research in the physical sciences during the past half century has been a synthesis of quantum and relativity physics. What we have just considered is change in the major emphases at the cutting edge of scientific inquiry into the nature of physical phenomena. It is nevertheless true that Newtonian physics remains extremely useful and suffi- ciently correct as a predictor of macroscopic physical events on or near the surface of the earth?although no round trips to the moon could have been accomplished in exclusive reliance on classical physics. Moreover. Em- stein built (almost immediately) upon Planck's discovery, just as special relativity theory contributes importantly to subatomic as well as to astronomical research today.</page><page sequence="3">99 With better justification than in the case of physics, antiquarian biology also is identified with Aristotle, "whose original research was in the field of biology; his whole conception of nature was biological and influenced by a way of thought which today does not seem applicable to inanimate objects" (Sambursky, 1975:40-41). Aristotle's biology survived even longer than his physics?until the advent of Darwinism some 125 years ago marked the inception of the classical paradigm in biology. However, like physics, biology underwent a major change in para- digm with the 1930 discovery (independently by Carl Correns, Hugo de Vries, and Erich von Terschermak) of both Mendel's original article and his principles of genetic inheritance. Together, these constitute in effect a quantum theory of biotic change (Margenau, 1950:453-454). In twentieth-century biology the Darwinian and Mendelian theories merged four decades ago in a "modern synthe- sis"?almost a decade after the synthesis in modern physics (Handler, 1970; Futuyama, 1979, ch. 1). This synthesis now provides the dominant macroparadigm for such diverse subfields as population, developmental, and molecular biology as well as for others such as behavioral genetics and animal behavior. Natural selection theory continues to dominate these and other fields of biological inquiry such as evolutionary theory (Williams, 1966) and sociobiology (Ruse, 1979), although not without signifi- cant and increasing dissent, especially from paleon- tologists (Stanley, 1979, 1981; and Newsweek, 1982:46). In both physics and biology, the shift from the classical to the modern paradigm has been much more evolution- ary than revolutionary. The revolutionary change came when classical physics and classical biology became differentiated from antiquarian natural science. Both the theory and the substantive knowledge of the mac- roparadigms that prevailed before Newton and Darwin were displaced by //re/ir classical works. Then the resulting classical macroparadigms became synthesized into their respective neoclassical forms. Notwithstanding their classical heritage and components, in macroparadigmatic terms, both modern physics and modern biology are pri- marily twentieth-century sciences. The persistence of Ar- istotelian politics and philosophy (and a host of other such antiquarian and preclassical sources) in contemporary political science, not as an aspect of the history of the discipline but rather as the foundation of "theory" in the field, undoubtedly would be an anomaly //political science were an integrated science?but of course that has never been true. A major segment of political science remains, for purposes of teaching and research alike, humanities- oriented. Thus the antiquarian paradigm persists because of political science's prescientific structure. Political Science Pseudoparadigms About a hundred years ago the profession of political science did begin with a paradigm. It involved humanities- oriented, "traditional" (Schubert, 1965:159-161), institu- tional studies focused in public law, history, and philoso- phy, and it lasted for about forty years. There were, of course, early challenges such as those of Bentley (1908) and Wallas (1908), but the disintegration of the traditional approach as a paradigm directing and dominating the activities of the profession began in the twenties (Somit and Tanenhaus, 1967:87-89; and with particular reference to the public-law component of traditionalism, see Schubert, 1966, Part I). The result was a substantial reorientation of the activities of many political scientists toward the social sciences (particularly sociology and economics). The reorientation was accompanied by a strong emphasis on empiricism in research design and statistics in methodology. This marks the beginning of the importance of the "conventional" approach in political science (Schubert, 1965:161-163; 1967b:6-7, 11). The consequence was both post- and preparadigmatic: post- paradigmatic because the traditional approach ceased to dominate political science as a paradigm about sixty years ago; preparadigmatic because no single paradigm has dominated the profession since traditionalism was displaced (and see Hines, 1979). Instead, throughout the twenties, thirties, and forties (described as "The Middle Years" by Somit and Tanenhaus, 1967, Part 3), the tra- ditional and the conventional approaches competed with each other (and with the much smaller and still nascent behavioral- and policy-science minorities) without ever combining in the kind of synthesis that has characterized modem physics throughout the past half century. As an example of this synthesis, the electromagnetic transmis- sion of light is described completely independently by Heisenbergs quantum matrix-mechanics and by de Bro- glie-Schrodinger's relativity wave-mechanics (of which one direct by-product was the invention of the electron microscope)?both of which were translated by Dirac and von Neumann into the same mathematical "transforma- tional theory" that became the basis for quantum me- chanics (Margenau, 1950:329-330; Rao, 1962:27). By way of contrast, in political science, the traditional and conventional approaches were (and still are!) practiced by different persons. During the period 1920-1950, the di- chotomy was such that they often were practiced by dif- ferent departments of political science. The behavioral revolution in political science, pro- claimed a bit belatedly by Truman (1955) and (with equivalent insouciance) buried prematurely by Dahl (1961), involved for many political scientists much closer interdisciplinary ties with social psychology and cultural anthropology. It was accompanied by an intensified em- phasis upon scientific theory and method (Kaplan, 1964) as well as quantification in the collection and analysis of data. This fulfillment of another major facet of Merriam's vision is described by Somit and Tanenhaus (1967, ch. 12; and cf. Schubert, 1968) and was marked by the re- incarnation of several harbingers who had been half a century ahead of the profession in their thinking, including both Bentley (Truman, 1951) and Wallas (Davies, 1963). But the rise of behavioralism did not signify the disap- pearance of either traditional or conventional political science. To the contrary, a troika replaced the former duopoly. The result was neither a dominant paradigm nor a new synthesis, but rather an extension of the preexisting condominium. At the end of the sixties there appeared a cross-sec- tional report on the current state of the discipline (Eulau and March, 1969) that virtually reeked with the behavioral approach. The report stands in fascinating contrast to the Dimock report (Committee for the Advancement of Teaching, 1951), in which the word behavior is in no way indexed and in fact appears a total of ten times in a book of some three hundred pages. Also, at the end of the sixties came David Easton's (1969) open-armed embrace</page><page sequence="4">100 of what he called "post-behavioralism." Although this was a readily understandable gesture given both the aca- demic-professional and public politics of the time (Schubert, 1976:162), Easton was at the very least eu- phoric in his suggestion that political science was about to shuck its scientific pose for a forthright engineering stance. The American Political Science Association (APSA) never did become scientific, as we have noted, in its orientation?only behavioralism's most extreme en- thusiasts, and opponents, closed ranks to proclaim that (Eulau, 1963; Storing, 1962; McCoy and Playford, 1967; Graham and Carey, 1972). Thus, Easton's claim that "the last revolution?behavioralism" was "completed" is as wide of the mark as his prediction that the "battle cries" of "relevance and action" (Easton's emphasis) were about to put the American Political Science Association in the vanguard of political engineering efforts to resolve "the increasing social and political crises of our time" (Easton, 1969:1051; and cf. Lasswell, 1963). That didn't happen either, although a greater concern for institution- alized egalitarianism in the profession and in academic life and for the public policy implications of research and teaching was certainly more evident during the seventies than before. This, however, is no more "postbehavioral" than it is "posttraditional" (Rodman, 1980:44-45) or "postconventional." As Somit and Tanenhaus (1967:88) point out, the APSA's Committee on Policy (under Thomas Reed) was active during the late twenties and early thir- ties. Furthermore, it was reinforced by Merriam's own strong interest in civic education and by the life-long es- pousal of a "policy science" approach on the part of Merriam's leading student, Lasswell. Therefore, what Easton called "post-behavioralism" can better be under- stood as the coming of age of yet another long-standing though minority movement within the discipline (cf. Ho- rowitz, 1979; and for an alternative analysis of half a dozen metaphysically-defined pseudoparadigms of politi- cal science, see Haas, 1982). There was another new development, and this one was within behavioralism (as well as, of course, within political science). It began?at least as an organized activity?at about the same time that the Caucus for a New Political Science was riding high and Easton was describing behavioralism in the past tense. The first panel on a bio- logical approach to politics convened at the Southern Political Science Association meeting in New Orleans in November 1967. Earlier that year I published a model of academic ideology (Schubert, 1967b:7)?one that did incidentally prove to be predictive (Schubert, 1967a). It distinguished among the traditional, conventional, and behavioral approaches in political science and defined biology (flanked by psychology on one side and anthro- pology on the other) as the core of the behavioral ap- proach. A year or more earlier when the pair of articles was written, I did not know that there would ever be a political science panel on biopolitics (to say nothing of one that would meet as soon as the following year), so at the time this was a precocious venture in forecasting the fu- ture of the profession. In ignorance also of Easton's im- minent requiem for behavioralism, my salutation to ??/obehavioralism heralded an approach in political sci- ence that by now is well established as a viable devel- opment within the profession, as attested by the convening of the panel at which this article was first pre- sented under the auspices of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences. There are several recent reviews of the scope and content of biobehavioral political science (Somit, 1976; Wiegele, 1979), and an extensive research literature is now available (Somit et al., 1980; Peterson et al., 1981). Biobehavioralism is also the subject of John Wahlke's recent APSA presidential address, of which "pre-behav- ioralism" purports to be the theme (Wahlke, 1979). His analysis rests upon a sample of articles published in the American Political Science Review during the decade 1968-1977. Coincidental^, a paper (Schubert, 1976:157- 161) at a small research conference where Wahlke was a commentator reported what appears to be the only rele- vant pilot survey along lines similar to Wahlke's subse- quent empirical investigation, although the earlier sample covered only three years (1972-1974) in the middle of his. He was certainly aware of it at the time (Wahlke, 1976:255 and 259, n7), but he does not mention the prototype study in his presidential address. This omission would be un- remarkable except for the fact that "prebehavioralism" (a novel concept at the time of the conference paper) is defined very differently in 1976 than it is in Wahlke's 1979 presidential address. Originally, prebehavioralism was defined quite literally as traditional and conventional po- litical science (Schubert, 1976:163-164). Subsequently, Wahlke spoke entirely figuratively when in his analysis of the content of a decade of political behavior research, he criticized that research for its failure (1) to be "anchored in macro-level political theory" and (2) to include physi- ology in its conception and methodology of political psy- chology (Wahlke, 1979:24). I find it easy to empathize with both criticisms. Indeed, my earlier discussion of prebe- havioralism pointed out that "the implications of biological theory, for the perpetuation of much of traditional political science, are much more revolutionary than those of po- litical behavioralism as it has been understood hereto- fore," and I followed this remark with an explanation of how and why this is probable (Schubert, 1976:164). However, it is rhetorical to argue that the "real" political behavioral approach has not yet become immanent among us. Prebehavioralism as defined by Wahlke, like postbehavioralism as defined by Easton, obscures more than it reveals about the evolution of political behav- ioralism during the past two decades. The one aspect of biobehavioralism to be emphasized in the discussion below is the relation of biophysics to psychobiology. At the inception of work in biopolitics, Davies (1969) directed attention to the great potential importance of brain science for political science (see also Davies, 1976; Cory, 1974; Beck, 1976; Geigle, 1977; and Laponce, 1978), and interest in brain science has accel- erated in the past two or three years (White, 1980, 1981a, 1981b, 1982b; Peterson, 1981a, 1981b, 1982a. 1982b; Schubert, 1982c, forthcoming/a, forthcoming/b; Hines, 1982b; Manheim, 1982; and Kitchin, 1982). Brain science is of great potential importance to politics because it deals directly with what are rapidly becoming opera- tionalized?not merely metaphorical or analogical?theo- ries and processes of consciousness, memory, and decision-making in relation to both perception and emo- tionality (cf. Crook, 1980, especially ch. 2). Psy- chobiological politics deals directly with the control of human behavior, including political behavior. But precisely</page><page sequence="5">101 because the relevant theories are biophysical, their con- sideration requires some understanding of modern phys- ics as well as modern biology. Such a requirement places greater demands upon us. Nevertheless, psychobioiogy may proffer the best chance for political science?or at least for some political scien- tists?to transcend the classical as well as the antiquarian shackles that limit our ability to understand and our ca- pacity to resolve the complex political problems that preempt our attention and concern. Living forms are more complex than inanimate matter, and the laws of physics apply to humans, but the laws of human behavior do not necessarily apply to physical interactions (cf. Margenau, 1950:162). Our comprehension of human behavior lags by an accelerating exponential factor behind our under- standing of the physical universe. Consequently our the- ories of politics are going to have to be more?not less?complex than the theories and methodologies that modern physics utilizes. At the very least, we must seri- ously consider the possibility that models of political be- havior will be better informed by an awareness of what physical theory includes (and political theory doesn't) that would bring our theory closer to the facts of political life. As a step in that direction, we can consider some of the major characteristics of relativity theory and quantum theory in relation to classical physics and each other and also in terms of what kind of social science theory modern physics has stimulated thus far. Then we can examine the physical basis of modem biology, and in particular its implication for theories of consciousness and decision- making, including political decision-making, and hence its implication for psychobiological politics. Any reader of Somit and Tanenhaus (1967:113-114) should be aware that earlier presidential addresses can also serve as negative examples for us in approaching that task, for example, "Physics and Politics" by William Bennett Munro (1928). Under Munro's benign auspices was convened a conference hosted by Eulau some half dozen years ago at which political behavioralist stalwarts critiqued bi- opolitical upstarts. Of course no person who was social- ized as a social scientist some three and a half decades ago, and whose undergraduate education was primarily in the humanities, can profess to any profound knowledge of the physical sciences. But in the land of the blind, even a cyciops is in a position to see more and further than those who look not at all. Neoclassical Physics Relativity Theory Classical physics defines and describes a world that corresponds closely to the sensory perceptions that human biological evolution constrains us to accept as natural. As Ushenko (1946:xv) remarks, "the structure of the visual field is Euclidean and . . . our knowledge of this structure is intuitive." Among the principles of classical or antiquarian physics that political science continues to take for granted are those of irreversible causality, action by contact, and absolute time (Reichenbach, 1965:15). All of these are incompatible with experimental observations that led to Einstein's special relativity theory, which in the words of Werner Heisenberg (1974:187), "emerged from the electrodynamics of moving bodies and has led to new insights into the structure of space and time." Heisenberg (1958:117) asserts that the most important physical con- sequence of the special theory concerns the equivalence of mass and energy (i.e., the inertia of energy). Einstein's statement of the theory was put in more elegant mathe- matical form by his own former mathematics teacher, Minkowski, as a quadratic equation in which the separa- tion of space and time is not emphasized, leading to a four-dimensional space-time manifold or "world" (Rao, 1962:10). It is ironic that, as we now can appreciate, the special theory is "not about those aspects of reality that are relative, but about those aspects that are not relative." It portrays a static, nonmoving picture of space and time (Zukav, 1979:172, 180, emphasis added). In the special theory, length is not a characteristic of space, but of the bodies that occupy space, and space itself has no intrinsic metric (Salmon, 1980:23-24). Changes of length in different manifolds (congruence) become not a question of fact but of definition. Similarly, "simultaneity is not a matter of knowledge, but of coor- dinative definition" (Reichenbach, 1958:126), and as Margenau (1950:139) has remarked, there is no "natural unit" of time and hence no way in which "purely con- structional elements can be eliminated from conceptual time." Indeed Salmon (1980:64) suggests the possibility that both space and time are quantized in structure, for "we do not experience time as a continuum of instants without duration, but rather, as a discrete series of spe- cious presents" (Salmon, 1980:42). Such experience ("history") "contains the idea of the 'arrow of time,'" but this is "a concept absent in all fundamental laws of physics that can be expressed mathematically" (Cocconi, 1970:82). Thus classical mechanics defines a temporal order but not a direction for time. However, as Grunbaum (1973:327) comments: It is of the essence of the relativistic account of the inanimate world as embodied in the Minkowski rep- resentation that there is change in the sense that different kinds of events can (do) occur at different times: the attributes and relations of an object asso- ciated with any given world-line may be different at different times. . . . Consequently, the total states of the world ... are correspondingly different at different times, i.e., they change with time. General relativity theory focuses on the relationship between gravity and inertia (Heisenberg, 1958:121), and empirical observation demonstrates that inertial and gravitational mass are equal in the gravitational field of the earth. This contradicts both the special theory and also the Euclidian geometry of space (Reichenbach, 1965:31). In the general theory: Einstein had to connect the underlying physical ideas with the mathematical scheme of general geometry that had been developed by Riemann. Since the properties of space seemed to change continuously with the gravitational fields, its geometry had to be compared with the geometry on curved surfaces where the straight line of Euclidian geometry has to be replaced by the geodetical line, the line of shortest distance, and where the curvature changes continu- ously (Heisenberg, 1958:122). Einstein's general theory established a connection be- tween the geometry of the four-dimensional space-time manifold and the distribution of masses in the world; the special theory became a limiting case of a vanishing</page><page sequence="6">102 gravitational field (Rao, 1962:15). Thus, from the per- spective of general relativity theory, "an event has many dates in the same sense in which it has many sizes and shapes . . . relatively to different standpoints" (Ushenko, 1937:75). Because the general theory deals with vast expanses of the universe, it cannot be either proved or disproved on the basis of earthly phenomena?instead, it must be tested through astronomy. Four principal verifi- cations (of which the first has recently been questioned) involve the perihelion of Mercury, the deflection of star- light, the gravitational "red shift" of the light from distant stars, and the still novel phenomenon of black holes. Field Theory A major component of Einstein's theories of relativity is electromagnetic mechanics. According to Margenau (1950: 198), "The method of science reaches its fullest development in the theory of the electromagnetic field" (and for a general survey of field theory, see Sachs, 1973). Such a field is defined by two vectors, themselves the product of six sealers (just as, in quantum mechanics, there are well-established operators for six different ob- servables); and the electromagnetic field defined by the pair of vectors is assumed to pervade the space where it is observed (or presumed) to be (Margenau, 1950:201, 349). Because of its success in electrodynamics, the field approach (in the form of the "force field") spread to mechanics. Here, however, its use is confined to statics (Margenau, 1950: 204). "Biological fields . . . borrow . . . features from several physical types in an endeavor to account for organization and growth. One serious difficulty ... is their failure to grasp clearly the methodological requirements involved" (Margenau, 1950:204-205), in- cluding those relating to the unambiguous definition of the set of state variables and the laws regulating their be- havior. Unified Field Theory It has long been part of the folklore of this century's phi- losophy of science that Einstein failed in the quest that preoccupied the last forty years of his life?the attempt to develop a unified theory of the gravitational and electro- magnetic fields (Thomas, 1930:761; Wheeler, 1962; Grunbaum, 1973, ch. 22). Wheeler (1962:366-367) claims that Einstein persisted in his efforts because he wanted to derive from "some kind of classical geometry" not only electromagnetism "but also quantum theory itself." In his recollections of his own discussions with Einstein on epistemologica! problems in atomic physics, Niels Bohr (1958:32-66) recounts the frequent occasions on which Einstein argued against the quantum approach and ex- pressed unhappiness because of the "apparent lack of firmly laid down principles for the explanation of nature, in which all could agree" (Bohr, 1958:56). Heisenberg (1974:189) points out that "relativity theory . . . neglects those features of nature which are tied up with Planck's quantum of action; it therefore continues to presuppose that the phenomena can be objectified in the manner of classical physics." Heisenberg (1974:5) remarks also that "Einstein's was a conservative mind. Through his years of development he had become wedded to the nineteenth- century belief in progress, and his essays reflected the picture of a world which, though because of human irra- tionality it was exceedingly imperfect, could yet become better and better if men were ready to break with their former prejudices and put trust in reason." Five years before Einstein's death, Margenau (1950:39, n1) noted, "It has become customary among physicists to regard as 'classical' the whole field of physics which antedates quantum mechanics (about 1920). Even relativity is now part of classical physics." Classical Physics and Preclassical Biology in Political Science The Rashevsky Models More than a few political scientists are familiar with the series of papers, rather tightly clustered within a period of about half a dozen years, that Nicolas Rashevsky pub- lished (1947, 1951, 1954) proposing mathematical mod- els of social behavior, drawing in part upon his earlier work (1938) that had focused upon the biophysics of in- dividual behavior. The author was a distinguished bio- physicist, and he employs the mathematical methods of biophysics in his analyses; but only in the first part of the middle work, five chapters that discuss brain mechanism and behavior, is his subject matter biophysical. Hence for our purposes, Rashevsky's work primarily represents an example of mathematical modeling of social relationships rather than an attempt to use physics or biophysics theory to model politics. Coleman (1954) commented extensively upon the first set of papers, of which two (1947, chs. 17 and 23) do focus on political relationships. Karl Deutsch (1963:39-41) discusses particularly the first of these two chapters (on "Interaction of Nations"), noting that the usefulness of Rashevsky's sophisticated mathematical techniques is limited by his regrettably naive assumptions about the empirical structure of the social groups that he analyzed. Systems Theory Landau (1961) has analyzed in detail how the paradigm of classical physics continues to dominate our constitu- tional polity in this country?long after such a model has proven inadequate to cope with the needs of twentieth- century physics (cf. ?. Deutsch, 1963:26-30; and Schubert, 1967c). In lieu of classical physics, Landau (1968) has discussed the differences implied by an or- ganismic biological model that derives from antiquarian rather than classical biology (and cf. ?. Deutsch, 1963:30- 34). Thus, the theory that he discusses?and the only kind that has influenced political science, through the respec- tive works of Robert Merton and David Easton and Gabriel Almond and their many followers?is actually pre-Dar- winian, and it has certainly proven to be no more ade- quate than Newtonian physics as a basis for a modern theory of politics. Karl Deutsch's Nerves of Government (1963) sounds like it might proffer a psychobiological model of political behavior, but the nerves are only a metaphor, and the book in fact discusses a cybernetic approach based on the computer (of two decades ago) as a model for human decision-making. Deutsch's model turns out to be that of a relatively sophisticated ma- chine?yet another example of classical physics as a model for politics.</page><page sequence="7">103 Field Theory and Politics According to Morton Deutsch (1968:406), "In psychology, the term 'field theory' is used primarily to designate the point of view of Kurt Lewin and his co-workers. Although the term has its origin in physics, where it is employed to refer to the conceptualization of electromagnetic phe- nomena in terms of fields of electromagnetic forces, field theory in psychology is not an attempt to explain psy- chological events in terms of physical processes." Lewin's field theory held "that events are determined by forces acting at a distance" (Lippit, 1968:266)?but this is the theory of Aristotelian physics, certainly not that of even classical physics (Sachs, 1973:20-24). However incon- sistently, Lewin nevertheless attempted to make a literal translation of selected aspects of Einstein's theory of rel- ativity and apply them figuratively as a metaphor for a holistic approach to social psychology. As Dorwin Cart- wright, one of Lewin's leading American disciples, states, "field theory is more an approach to the scientific task than a theory about a realm of data" (Lewin, 195l:viii; and cf. Lewin's own statement, 1951:45). Lewin conceptual- izes all behavior (including acting, thinking, wishing, striving, valuing, achieving) as a differential (literally: dx/dt) of a field state in relation to time?a locus, that is to say, in the four-dimensional space-time manifold. The relevant field for an individual is her or his "life space," comprising the self and its psychological environment. The extension of this concept from the individual to group psychology is perfectly straightforward (i.e., additive). Lewin "believed strongly that a set of interdependent facts can be adequately handled conceptually only with the mathematical concept of space and the dynamic concepts of tension and force" (Lewin, 1951:xiii). Einstein's defini- tion of simultaneity (Salmon, 1980, ch. 4, especially p. 100), which in the special theory assumes reciprocity in the speed of light between two points in a given inertial reference frame, has its counterpart (of sorts) in Lewin's principle of contemporaneity where the mathematical time-differential of physics dissolves into language about measuring behavioral change "at a given time" (Lewin, 1951:45-46). Similarly, the topological mapping of general relativity theory is explicitly analogized (Lewin, 1951:150- 151) to what is no doubt the least accepted feature of Lewin's approach, "hodological space" (which, unlike Einstein's, is nonmetrical). Lewin ignored quantum theory, which was of course fully developed when he left Ger- many to come to the United States?at the same time (1933) and from the same place (the University of Berlin) as Einstein. A book describing social science applications of field theory entirely sympathetically (Mey, 1965:47, 237) mentions the Heisenberg effect only as a problem for quantum physics?not as a problem concerning transac- tions between manifest change in social behavior and the latent structure of the minds of the field theorist re- searchers who observe it. Mey (1965:131, 279, n35) virtually ignores the criti- cisms of field theory by Sorokin (1964:vii), who prefaces a polemical volume with the admission that it "aims at a liberation of sociology and the social sciences from vol- untary servitude to the natural sciences." Having already written off both modern physics and modern biology as unsuitable paradigms for "sociocultural space," Sorokin (1964:97, 109-110) characterizes Lewin's approach as a purely analogical use of the concepts of space of physicomathematical sciences ... [in which] the whole operation is a mere verbal preoccupation of "ordering of some phenomena of behavior" to the "psychological field" ... with the terms "magnitude," "force," "vector," "field," . . . which ... do not add anything to our knowledge. . . . [S]uch a useless transcription of the terms would have some advan- tage and cognitive value if the transported terms could be measured adequately or were metrical, as they are in physicomathematical sciences . . . [but] where there are no units and numbers, all the for- mulas and equations are void and meaningless. Social science field theory gives lip service to the (dis- tinctly nonverbal) field theory of electrodynamics and rel- ativity, but its substance, in terms of theory and methods alike, comes from neither modern nor neoclassical physics, but rather from nineteenth-century biology in the form of gestalt psychology. One of the earliest and best-known uses of field theory in political science is in Quincy Wright's The Study of International Relations (1955:488-492, 524-528, 539-567, 586-603; and cf. McClelland, 1971). His discussion is explicitly eclectic and implicitly synthetic, but he never attempts to provide a rigorous definition of "field." Fur- thermore, the dimensionality of the model that he has in mind is never clarified, although virtually all of his empir- ical examples are two-dimensional. According to Wright (1955:524), "A field is a system defined by time and space or by analytical co-ordinates, and by the properties, relations, and movements of the entities within it." The first of these meanings is entirely literal because Wright is talking about political geography and "conditions of actual time and space" (1955:540). The second meaning, al- though more psychological, is strictly psychometric and denotes primarily factor analysis (which at that time was still a novel methodology in political science). Neither meaning has much to do with the concept of field in rel- ativity theory; and although Wright (1955:525) does re- mark that "Einstein's four-dimensional curved time-space may differ from Euclid's three-dimensional space," he adds, "but they are both real fields" (emphasis added). One wonders in what sense? Factor analysis and other psychometric modes of multidimensional analysis were commonly employed in many fields in political science during the sixties, including judicial behavior?a development of which I am not en- tirely innocent (Schubert, 1961, 1962, 1975); but I thought then, and believe now, that the relationship between factor analysis and either Lewin's approach or Einstein's is one of orthogonality. Rudolph Rummel is a leading contemporary exponent of the ideas of Quincy Wright regarding the use of field theory to study international relations. The author of the first comprehensive treatise by a political scientist on factor analysis (Rummel, 1970), he explicitly acknowl- edges his indebtedness to both Lewin and Wright (Rum- mel, 1975:35-44, 60-62). Rummers is the most thoroughgoing attempt to construct a mathematically based, operationally defined, and empirically testable field theory of politics, as presented in his reports on and ap- praisals of the Dimensionality of Nations project (Rummel, 1977, 1978, 1979; and cf. Ray, 1982). However, what Rummel calls "field theory" is a statistical design for using</page><page sequence="8">104 canonical correlations to map Euclidean factorial attribute space into Euclidean factorial behavioral space, using the distance vectors of the attribute space to determine rela- tionships in the behavioral space. Methodologically, this remains factor analysis, although it is more complex than its usual employment in political science, and it presumes linear causation from attributes to behavior. The result is no doubt a powerful analytic tool for mapping and facili- tating comparative analysis of large variable-sets of data about the characteristics and behaviors of the nation- states with which Rummel is concerned. However, in his opinion (Rummel, 1975:28), "'field* cannot be operation- ally defined"; therefore, it is difficult to see how his own use of field theory could possibly be other than meta- phorical. To use his own example, war "must be con- sidered as part of a behavioral matrix (what I would later call a field' (Rummel, 1976:22, emphasis added). The indispensable requirement for field theory is "the notion of forces spread continuously throughout the region" (Rummel, 1975:29), but Rummel defines "forces" as "attribute (social) distances" in factor space (Rummel, 1977:200). The substantive content of the propositions "on social conflict" that he tests (Rummel, 1979:355-375; but cf., e.g., Proposition 18.1, p. 339, and Proposition 18.4, p. 345; and Ray, 1982:167) is not based on math- ematical deductions from what he calls "field theory" (because that mathematics is about statistical transfor- mations between factorial spaces. Instead, these propositions are constructions subjectively related to the constellation of values that his self-taught course of the great books imparted, beginning a dozen years ago co- incident with his avowed renunciation of logical positivism (Rummel, 1976; and on Rummel's ideology, see Ray, 1982:168, 178, 180-182) A field theory of politics?however constrained in time and place its application for empirical testing may be?ought itself to specify the substantive relationships in political behavior (whether of nation states or groups of individuals, and whether about war or revolution or as- sassination, or even about more peaceful behaviors) rather than focusing on how to process data in order to make statistical decisions about (otherwise derived) po- litical propositions. Rummel's reversal of his own field, from hard-core scientism (before 1970) to soft-core, so- cial-science-humanism (since 1975) complicates the task of interpreting the ten books that he has published within the past decade. It is clear that he believes that his "field theory" manifests "a quantum theory perspective" (Rummel, 1977:483) and that his voluminous reports of complex analyses of empirically based findings provide powerful support for his theory (Rummel, 1979:357; but cf. Rummel, 1977:398). I remain dubious, but international politics is not a subfield of political science in which I can claim any special competence. Political scientists who can make such an assertion have thus far failed to indicate much in the way of either agreement or disagreement with the merits of Rummel's claims, either empirically or as field theory. No doubt time will tell. Modem Physics Speaking with reference to people of the Third World, but on a subject that may conceivably have some import even for us sophisticates of the First, F. S. C. Northrop, in his introduction to Werner Heisenbergs (1958:2-3) book on the philosophy of physics, points out: one cannot bring in the instruments of modern physics without sooner or later introducing its philo- sophical mentality, and this mentality, as it captures the scientifically trained youth, upsets the old familial and tribal moral loyalties. If unnecessary emotional conflict and social demoralization are not to result, it is important that the youth understand what is hap- pening to them. This means that they must see their experience as the coming together of two different philosophical mentalities, that of their traditional cul- ture and that of the new physics. Hence, the impor- tance for everyone of understanding the philosophy of the new physics. And so it is for political scientists who are asked to take modern physics seriously. Surely our understanding of political life is not independent of our conception of the physical world. No matter how we orient our profession toward other disciplines, our conceptions of public politi- cal life are going to be largely determined by our con- ceptions of the nature of the physical environment in which humans live?and of the nature of humans them- selves. Quantum Physics Newtonian classical physics deals primarily with the mesoscopic events that can be related to human sensa- tion and experience. General relativity classicism deals primarily with megascopic phenomena, (i.e., physical events in our own solar system) in their relationship with the rest of the universe. Quantum mechanics deals with submicroscopic events at the level of the infrastructure of the atom, where matter reduces into energy, and time (in the meso-macroscopic sense) becomes irrelevant?for the dual reasons that it can be neither measured nor perceived (and for an excellent overview of quantum theory, see B?hm, 1980, eh. 4). In quantum mechanics, time has neither temporal order nor direction: "Time ap- pears to be a completely macroscopic phenomenon, which cannot be traced into the microcosm" (Reichen- bach, 1956:269). The modern physical world of quantum physics presents us with images of reality that defy, and can never be confirmed by, common sense. It is little wonder that a political science that cannot yet accept nineteenth-century biology rejects twentieth-century quantum physics out of hand, as having no conceivable part to play in either our understanding or practice of politics. More than half a century ago, it was clear "that oc- currences on the atomic scale obeyed 'discontinuous' laws of quanta, that the principle of continuity prevailing in perceived microscopic work is merely simulated by an averaging process in a world which, in truth, is discon- tinuous by its very nature" (Rao, 1962:26). By then, all atomic phenomena had been unified on the basis of Bohr's principle of complementarity, which emphasizes the relation between observer and observed and assumes the duality of independent particle and wave facets of physical reality (Heisenberg, 1958, eh. 2; Gamow, 1966;</page><page sequence="9">105 Guillemin, 1968). The principle of complementarity "is equivalent to the uncertainty principle or the principle of indeterminism which has brought about the fall of the notion of causality in physics" (Rao, 1962:4; B?hm, 1957). Quantum mechanics gives the same results as classical physics for the motion of ordinary objects (Margenau, 1950:44). Indeed, "every periodic motion of classical physics, properly studied in ordinary dynamics, has as its quantum counterpart a stationary state whose study be- longs to quantum statics" (Margenau, 1950:351; and cf. Sachs, 1973). Thus, "the quantum theory gives an ac- count of the mechanical processes in the interior of the atom, but it also incorporates Newtonian mechanics, as the limiting case in which we are able to objectify the events completely and can neglect the interaction be- tween the object under investigation and the observer himself" (Heisenberg, 1974:187). Although special relativity and quantum mechanics contributed to each other's development during the early decades of this century, the general relativity standpoint has been insignificant for most purposes in quantum theory because the direct effects of gravitation in ordinary atomic phenomena are extremely small: 1025 of even the weak decay interactions of elementary particles, which in turn are only 1014 in electromagnetic strength as com- pared to the bonds in atomic nuclei (Rao, 1962:52, 57). However, the physics of elementary particles now relies considerably upon investigations using cosmic radiation (Heisenberg, 1974:187). Subatomic particles are energy and have no objective or independent existence of their own. They have wave-like as well as particle-like char- acteristics, and they may represent interactions between or among fields (Zukav, 1979:217-220). According to Reichenbach (1956:263): The difference between one and two, or even three, material particles can be shown to be a matter of interpretation; that is, this difference is not an objec- tive fact, but depends on the language used for the description. The number of material particles, there- fore, is contingent upon the extension rules of lan- guage. However, the interpretations thus admitted for the language of physics differ in one essential point from all others: they require an abandonment of the order of time. In the absence of some kind of measurement, quantum mechanics has nothing to say (Zukav, 1979:322). The "observed" system cannot be observed until it interacts with an observing system, and only its effects on a measuring device can be observed then (Zukav, 1979: 93). Consequently, "what we perceive to be physical re- ality is actually our cognitive construction of it"?even light, the speed of which is the unit of measurement of relativity physics?"without us, light does not exist" (Zukav, 1979:105, 118). With the use of the most precise measurement con- trivable, it is still not possible in quantum physics to de- termine the "locus" of a particle of "matter" in the space- time manifold of classical physics. This fact leads to "the reciprocal indeterminancy of time and energy quantities" (Bohr, 1958:53). To such a moving particle is attributed two properties, position and momentum. The observer can choose which one to attempt to measure?but never both in the same observation (e.g., at the same "time"). This is because the act of measurement itself involves an interaction with the particle, which changes the particle. Hence, whichever attribute the observer selects to measure, he or she must remain uncertain about what the measurement of the other attribute would have been if it had been selected instead. Thus, the unmeasured attri- bute remains unobserved and indeterminate. This is the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty. There is another sense in which the predictions of quantum mechanics lead to indeterminancy. "Given a beam of electrons, quantum theory can predict the probability distribution of the electrons over a given space at a given time, but quantum theory cannot predict, even in principle, the course of a single electron" (Zukav, 1979:135, emphasis added). Prediction in quantum mechanics is statistical, not particular, and high-energy particles are continuously changing anyhow. Individual events are chance happen- ings. Zukav (1979:56, 135) asserts that the uncertainty principle undermines the whole idea of a causal universe and that because objectivity?which would require the elimination of the observer?is not possible in quantum mechanics, physics has become a branch of psychology. (He suggests also the possibility that psychology is be- coming a branch of physics, but for that to happen particle physicists would have to become educated as neurobi- ologists.) Heisenberg himself has remarked (1958:173- 174), in regard to the principle named after him, that prior to the development of quantum theory, "It was not denied that every observation had some, influence on the phe- nomenon to be observed but it was generally assumed that by doing the experiments cautiously this influence could be made arbitrarily small. This seemed in fact a necessary condition for the ideal of objectivity which was considered as the basis of all natural science." To social scientists, this will strike a familiar chord, as one con- templates the self-satisfaction with which it is now as- sumed that the best antidote for investigator bias is candor in disclosure?leaving it up to the auditor to evaluate the subjective effect of the revealed bias on the reported findings (cf. Gould, 1980:50). The Biophysics of the Brain In a very influential book written during World War II while he was an exile in Ireland, Erwin Schrodinger (who had been a leading figure in the development of quantum theory) asked (1944), "Is life based on the laws of physics?" He encouraged numbers of young physicists to get involved in molecular biology, and one of the short- range consequences was the identification of the structure of DNA (Watson, 1968; and cf. Stent, 1969:21-22, 55). The longer-range consequence has been the widespread and increasing realization, among physicists and biolo- gists alike, of the importance of modern physics to the understanding of many biological structures and proc- esses. A recent article by Goldman (1980) presents the case for a unified theory of biology and physics, in terms of more than a dozen examples. Most of these originated in quantum physics, and he remarks that "there is no reason to believe that any physical process that violates the laws of physics will ever be found in an organism" (Goldman, 1980:346). A commentator on the article (Rosen, 1980: 363-364) mentions that "many quantum physicists have</page><page sequence="10">106 felt that there must be profound relations between mi- crophysics and life. From the earliest days of quantum theory, there has been extensive preoccupation with ar- ticulating the relation between that theory and biology." Rosen's view, which he insists is "not couched in terms of analogy, but as a causal implication of general micro- physical principles," is that a phenotype comprises "a pattern generated by an observation of the genome, in the quantum-theoretic sense" (Rosen's emphasis). There is an extensive literature, both research and popular, that discusses constructional biology (Wheeler and Danielli, 1982)?models of the biophysics of the human brain. Examples of more technical models include Ingber's 1981 article, "Toward a Unified Brain Theory," and the book by Edelman and Mountcastle (1978). More easily readable but equally authoritative presentations are those of Pribram (1971, 1979) and Roederer (1978). See also the section, "Quantum Psychophysics" in Pelletier (1978:132-141). For work in this area by political scien- tists, see Peterson (1982a, 1982b) and my own summary of much of the recent work (Schubert, 1982c). Roederer (who is a physicist) remarks, "Brains have evolved as the result of adaptive interactions with the environment of living systems with locomotion capability. In this course of evolution the human brain emerged as the most organized and the most complex system in the universe as we presently know it" (1978:426, Roederer's emphasis). Roederer states that environmental representation and prediction are the most fundamental central operations of the brain, and he presents an excellent summary of the characteristics of the operational modes of animal brains (1978:427-428). The human brain, however, is unique in that "the human and only the human brain can perform [the recall of] images or representations, alter them, and store modified or amended versions thereof without any external input" (Roederer, 1978:431). Roederer also points out (1978:432) that "storage of retrievable infor- mation in the environment emerged as a most essential complement to brain operations . . . later in the form of . . . written language." Now of course, retrievable infor- mation is stored through the various modes of artificial intelligence, including computer hardware and software systems that are themselves the products of construc- tional biology. In his last writing, Heisenberg (1977:5) recalled that in 1926 when the quantum paradigm had not yet quite be- come consensual, a major problem in understanding the observational data was that "the language we used for the description of the phenomena was not quite adequate." He recalls also that while still trying to work his way through the problem, "In the despair about the futility of my attempts I remembered a discussion with Einstein and his remark: 'it is the theory which decides what can be observed.' Therefore I tried to turn around the question. Is it perhaps true that only such situations occur in nature or in the experiments which can be represented in the mathematical scheme of quantum mechanics?" This is another way of saying that perception is so dependent on conceptualization that even the most highly trained and skilled natural scientist "sees" (observes) what is ex- pected in the language of his concept, whether mathe- matical or natural. Three varying perspectives of human perception (by a physicist, a biologist, and a political scientist, respectively) are presented by B?hm (1965:185- 230), Livingston (1978), and Laponce (1975, 1978). Comfort (1979) suggests what an observer might observe if his or her conceptions were translated (possibly through the employment of artificial intelligence) into a language (possibly mathematical and involving field theory and to- pology) isomorphic with what she or he assumes to be the holographic modus operandi of the human mind. B?hm (1977:561, 562) has commented on the two most important meanings associated with what has come to be called the Heisenberg principle. The first "showed, in effect, that the quantum needed for [the very accurate measurement of the position of an electron] would disturb the observed electron in an unpredictable and uncon- trollable way, and that as a result, it is impossible to assign to the electron simultaneous values of position and mo- mentum with greater accuracy than that specified by [their] uncertainty relations." The second showed that: the act of observation appears to play a key part; in the sense that it not only discloses or reveals the attributes of the electron, but also in the sense that through the irreducible disturbance it helps actually to make or produce these very attributes. This means that the classical notion of a world that is essentially independent of the actions of the human observer is ultimately denied. Rather, the human being not only comes to know the world, but in doing this, he par- ticipates in an essential way. Both meanings were incorporated in 1927 in what be- came known as the Copenhagen Interpretation, which according to Stapp (1972:1098): was essentially a rejection of the presumption that nature could be understood in terms of elementary space-time realities. According to the new view, the complete description of nature at the atomic level was given by probability functions that referred, not to underlying microscopic space-time realities, but rather to the macroscopic objects of sense experi- ence. Heisenberg himself, however, has insisted on distin- guishing between "the sensual perceptions of the ob- server" (which he calls "positivism") and "the Copenhagen interpretation [which] regards things and processes . . . describable in terms of classical concepts ... as the foundation of any physical interpretation: (1958: 145). So Heisenberg presumes an observer who is trained in, and who chooses to employ, the concepts of classical physics, to describe observations at the level of quantum physics. Almost four decades later came another major exten- sion of the uncertainty principle in the form of Bell's the- orem, which showed that, if the statistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, then many of our common- sense ideas about the world are profoundly mistaken. Zukav (1979:306) comments that this "projects the 'irra- tional' aspects of subatomic phenomena squarely into the macroscopic domain. It says that not only do events in the realm of the very small behave in ways which are utterly different from our commonsense view of the world, but also . . . events in the world at large." Nothing is, except to the extent that seeming makes it so. A by-product of the Copenhagen Interpretation has been a debate among philosophers of science over whether time has any physical meaning in the sense of</page><page sequence="11">107 "the present" or is exclusively a construction of human biology and culture, which reinforce each other in con- straining the brain to conceptualize, and therefore to perceive, time as a unidirectional continuum. The point is of some importance to quantum physicists because it is at the crux of what can be observed and interpreted. The matter is not made less uncomplicated by the circum- stance that all physical phenomena are obeying the Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy) and typically, manifestly so. Moreover, living organisms (and by no means least, the human brain?given its last ditch resis- tance, for example, to the physiological effects of starva- tion) characteristically contribute quite dynamically to the entropy of their environments in order to inhale, ingest, imbibe, and otherwise absorb the complex molecules that they then convert to their own needs and purposes with highly negentropic effects while life endures. At the mi- crolevel of quantum physics, matter resolves into chang- ing energy that has mass and momentum, but for either of these the "direction" of time is meaningless. Grunbaum (1973:324-325) states that, "the distinction between the past and the future of common sense and psychological time [with respect to which the transient now] acquires meaning has no relevance at all to the time of physical events, because it has no significance at all apart from the egocentric perspectives of a conscious (human) organism and from the immediate experiences of that organism. . . . [so] the concept of 'now' involves features peculiar to consciousness." However, if determinism is a definitional consequence of the theory in terms of which the physical world is observed, then it too is a construct?and in this instance, a highly rational rather than merely a common- sense product of human consciousness. This implies that neither the past nor the future is physically determined from the perspective of the present (which Grunbaum in- sists is strictly a matter of human psychology, not of physics). Both past and future (like the present) depend on probabilities and inferences from partial data that make all time indeterminate rationally (if not psychop- hysiologically as well as physically Comfort (1980) has suggested that, assuming alterna- tive representations of reality that exclude a space-time oriented observer, the understanding of reality that such representations postulate may not necessarily be confined to subatomic phenomena. It may also be useful in con- sidering "middle-order" process models, such as, in re- gard to evolutionary biology and morphogenesis. In an earlier article, Comfort (1979) considered the importance of non-Western philosophies and religions as the bases for such alternative representations of reality (and cf. Capra, 1975, 1980; Zukav, 1979). In the later article (1980), Comfort emphasizes Bohm's model of "implicate reality" and other direct derivatives of quantum mechan- ics. To examine the concept of speciation, Comfort pro- poses (1980:208) a counterintuitive model derived from quantum mechanics in place of the current model of modern evolutionary genetics, which is highly acceptable intuitively. He asserts that a major justification for doing so "is the power of the demonstration in physics that reality- models are metaphors designed to be operated by, and intelligible to, a time-and-space oriented homuncular ob- server." Time, as he notes, "is metaphorical in particle physics, and part of the attempt to transduce phenomena to a temporal observer." Furthermore, "the relevance of brain research is in showing the artificial character of self- evident human responses to the handling of phenomena." Thus, "what Bell's theorem . . . demonstrates is the in- compatibility with quantum-mechanical theory of the intu- itive formalism which sees, e.g., a photon pair as separate objects; they are neither objects nor separate" (Comfort, 1980:214). He concludes (1980:215), "It seems a nec- essary consequence of quantum physics that, as with the Newtonian model, we find out just how far it goes." A commentator on the paper (Heelan, 1980:218) explains that "the Hilbert space model within quantum mechanics is the 'second level' 'field-type' theory, objective in that it states relations . . . that abstract from concrete events (measurement events) in the space-time of human ob- servers." A third paper by Comfort (1981) focuses upon the B?hm (1980) implicate-explicate model (and cf. B?hm, 1971, 1973). His concern in this paper is with the relations of Bohm's implicate to a "hyperloop" (the "observer paradox"), which Comfort variously describes as "matter thinking itself" (1980:363), as the process "by which the brain generates 4-space by object formation from the 'plenum'" (1980:373), and as "the idea that conscious- ness involves a projection of a higher multidimensional order into a series of subjective moments, exactly as particles represent a similar projection into a series of discontinuous frames" (1980:364). "Bohm's model," Comfort explains (1980:364-365), "implies ... a quanti- zation of physical time" as well as a concept of empa- thetic time, both of which are united through the continuity of the implicate. Comfort continues: The field which B?hm terms the "holomovement" is of high order [political scientists: read as high ?//?order] but non-random (because the quantization of manifest phenomena is ... a graphic representa- tion of this subjacent non-local structure. . . . One effect of this idea is to transpose the kind of non- locality and interconnectedness which Wheeler has postulated at a micro-level ("the quantum foam") into a far more general property of Nature, which could be looked for macroscopically. Manifest phenomena are related to the holomovement by a process which B?hm calls explication. Since manifest phenomena are identified by their regularities?which are what we measure?it follows that any implicate exhibits regularities which are expressed in space-time A heterogeneous group of measurables (location, mass, spin, number, probability) constitutes the "observables." These represent "a tabulation of basic phenomena as they appear in the 'real' (explicate) world" (Comfort, 1980:366). The resulting projected reality bears a close resemblance to a hologram of a special kind, a reverse one, because "in our model... a pattern is translated into virtual objects, as when a hologram is viewed." Bohm's concept of "holomovement implies motion or change . . . [movement, change, and the like are themselves] transductions to a consciousness?change has no meaning except to a positional observer' (1980:366, Comfort's emphasis). "If anything is moving it has to be ourselves" (Comfort, 1980:367). "Our brain reduces re- ality to a Boolean logic, probably by reason of its hard- wired structure." One consequence is that "since all input takes a finite time for a mental encoding, there are no objective 'nows,' and we operate exclusively on a non- disobservable memory tape."</page><page sequence="12">108 "A manifest world," says Comfort (1980:369), "is a hands-on model in which organisms can operate without performing cumbersome calculations before doing so?for the relatively slow neurochemical mode used in brains, the algebra necessary . . . would be tran- scomputable. This is precisely what Kant meant by a prions?we are hard-wired to see a hands-on world composed of centroids and yes-no approximations. . . . The conclusion is overwhelming that time is [an] ... al- gorithm, that the subjective model has fundamental va- lidity different from that of t in the Minkowski figure. . . . How about . . . positional self? Very probably that too is a priori. " "There is no difficulty," Comfort concludes (1980:370- 371), "in talking scientific sense about explication in re- lation to electrons and similar inferential structures; the exercise consists in developing an algebra and then seeing if it fits, or predicts, observables. Moreover, parti- cle events, though inferential, are in a sense continuous with the normal, optical world, and display the same local consistency." As we experience "mind," "it is at least transduced by, and possibly wholly generated by, brain," but the brain's "hardware" has been uniquely generated epigenetically by the relevant body's lifetime of experi- ence. So the bottom-line question is whether conscious- ness is "as primary and as fundamental as 'matter,'" and this question "no longer makes scientific nonsense, be- cause it no longer runs counter to the prevalent under- standing of physics." What is in the mind is the implicate; mind itself "is the process of explication"; and what is observed is the ex- plicate (Comfort, 1980:372, Comfort's emphasis). It fol- lows that "without an observer, there is effectively no explication and there are no phenomena. . . . The con- clusion of a Bohmian model is . . . that we should rec- ognize . . ." phenomenal reality to be just as subjective as mind itself. How modern psychobiology?the physics of the brain- ?operationalizes the much more primitive concept of "psychology" entertained by the physicist discoverers of "the observer paradox" has been well summarized by Morowitz (1980:16; and see also the article's exception- ally apt set of three illustrations by Victor Juhasz, at pp. 12, 15, and 16): First, the human mind, including consciousness and reflective thought, can be explained by activities of the central nervous system, which, in turn, can be reduced to the biological structure and function of that physiological system. Second biological phenomena at all levels can be totally understood in terms of atomic physics, that is, through the action and inter- action of the component atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and so forth. Third and last, atomic physics, which is now understood most fully by means of quantum mechanics, must be formulated with the mind as a primitive component of the system. We have thus, in separate steps, gone around an epis- temologica! circle?from the mind, back to the mind. Quantizing Political Theory What are the implications for political theory of the ac- ceptance and use in the study of politics of the paradigm of modern physics? Obviously we need not consider those implications for politics itself because our worlds- ?terrestrial and extra-terrestrial alike?are replete with both material and psychic phenomena that are the prod- ucts and by-products of modern physics. So the only question that remains is when political science is going to begin to study its subject matter in terms ?somorphic with those used by us (humans, not us political scientists) to define politics. Decision Making The modern physics of psychobiology focuses dead center on what has long been a major concern of political scientists: how and why both individual and group deci- sions get made as they do. As quantum physicists and biologists have realized for four decades, and as we discussed in detail in the preceding section of the present article, the new paradigm of modern physics speaks not only to biology. Bell's theorem tolls for us political scien- tists, too. So likewise do Heisenbergs uncertainty prin- ciple, the Copenhagen interpretation, and Bohm's model of the explication of reality (and see especially B?hm, 1980, eh. 3). The paradoxes of observing and becoming challenge our accepted epistemology of politics in its most fundamental respects. The new paradigm teaches us that such leading postulates of political decision mak- ing as rationality, and of scientific method as objectivity, are themselves tautologies of psychobiological construc- tion. So is our favorite methodological postulate of cau- sality?that by sufficiently refined analysis and reduction we can determine linear (if parallel) action sequences, partitioning pieces of the action among independent and intermediate variables that determine change in one or more dependent variables. Aristotelian direct action is replaced by Bohmian action-at-a-distance due to the basic interconnectedness of all matter (and cf. Sachs, 1973). The deterministic political thinking derived from the classical physical paradigm continues to dominate not only the American constitution at all levels (Landau, 1961) but also the politics of Western societies generally. How- ever, the new paradigm signifies that if our political world (like all of our other worlds) inescapably represents a highly /^determinate complex of events regarding which great and continuing uncertainty is bound to continue (B?hm, 1957), then we ought to be constructing models of politics and political behavior in which chance plays a major part in explaining what is happening politically and why (Aubert, 1959; Schubert, 1975:330) instead of using models that restrict chance to the residual terms of our regression equations. There is, at the very least, no rea- son to assume that models making explicit room for chance effects in political processes and outcomes will do less well than the causative models on which we now typically rely, even though only too frequently such models fail to do better than the null hypothesis of nothing-but- chance. The Psychobiological Paradox Once the paradigm of modern physics becomes more generalized in the training and thinking of political scien- tists, the political explications of the quantum model of reality will extend over a much broader domain of political inquiry than the core subject of decision-making theory. This is so because such characteristics of reality as in- determinancy, irrationality, chance variation, diffuse tran- sactionality, and the artificiality of time as a measure of</page><page sequence="13">109 change are elements of physical and social?not only psychological?human environments. Since a beginning already has been made in political psychobiology, it is appropriate that we undertake a brief review of that work in concluding our consideration of the future paradigm of political science. Our first example derives from a lecture, "Of Clouds and Clocks," delivered by Karl Popper (1965), himself a sometime contributor to the development of quantum physics. The clocks are of course symbols of classical physics, and the clouds (as in "cloud chamber") signify quantum physics (and cf. Margenau's remark (1950:43, n1) that it was Schrodinger who first pictured the electron as a cloud). Popper echoed what is by now for us a familiar theme, saying (1965:10) that "behaviorist 'laws' are not, like those of Newtonian physics, differential equations and . . . every attempt to introduce such dif- ferential equations would lead beyond behaviorism into physiology, and thus ultimately into physics; so it would lead us back to the problem of physical determinism" (Popper's emphasis). Popper proclaimed himself to be a physical //7determinist, although he added that "indeter- minism is not enough" (1965:13) because "men, and perhaps animals, can be 'influenced' or 'controlled' by such things as aims, or purposes, or rules, or agreements. This then is our central problem" (1965:15). Popper ex- pressed his personal dislike of psychobiological theories in which the central nervous system acts like an electronic amplifier with "quantum jumps." Popper calls such the- ories "tiny baby theories," saying that "they seem to me to be almost as unattractive as tiny babies" (1965:17)?a remark reminiscent of the similar but perhaps more no- torious views of the late W. C. Fields?mais chaqu'un a son gout. Apart from Popper's feelings about neonates, however, he is criticizing here the psychobiologically naive views of an earlier generation of quantum physicists, who entertained too literal a mechanistic model of brain operations. The lecture is reprinted as Chapter 6 of Pop- per's Objective Knowledge (1972), and the thrust of that book's argument strongly favors a biologically based, evolutionary theory of human perception and conscious- ness, strongly reinforcing of the theories we reviewed in the immediately preceding sections of the present article (e.g., Popper, 1972:145-146): Sense organs, such as the eye, are prepared to react to certain selected environmental events?to those events which they "expect," and onlyXo those events. Like theories (and prejudices) they will in general be blind to others: to those which they do not under- stand, which they cannot interpret (because they do not correspond to any specific problem which the organism is trying to solve). Classical epistemology which takes our sense perceptions as "given," as the "data" from which our theories have to be constructed by some process of induction, can only be described as pre-Darwinian. It fails to take account of the fact that the alleged data are in fact adaptive reactions, and therefore inter- pretations which incorporate theories and prejudices and which, like theories, are impregnated with con- jectural expectations; that there can be no pure perception, no pure datum; exactly as there can be no pure observational language, since all languages are impregnated with theories and myths. Just as our eyes are blind to the unforeseen or unexpected, so our languages are unable to describe it (though our languages can grow?as can our sense organs, en- dosomatically as well as exosomatically). This consideration of the fact that theories or ex- pectations are built into our very sense organs shows that the epistemology of induction breaks down even before taking its first step. . . . Sense organs incor- porate the equivalent of primitive and uncritically ac- cepted theories, which are less widely tested than scientific theories. Almond and Genco (1978) take off from Popper's "Clouds and Clocks" chapter, although they ignore the remainder of his book, as well as the entire corpus of research literature in modern physics and psychobiology alike, to set forth an argument against "hard sci- ence"?which they equate with quantum physics (sic!). Such an identification seems possible only in the light of their failure to examine either what they think is "hard science" or the "hard-wiring" of the mind. Instead, they come up with a plug for a rejuvenation of the "policy- science" approach in political science. A recent article by White (1982b) also uses Popper's chapter on clouds and clocks as a springboard for re- pudiating physics as a relevant paradigm for political science. However, unlike Almond and Genco, who make no distinction between the "clocks" and the "clouds" (although that is the core of Popper's own argument), White does make it clear that what he rejects is classical physics. Curiously, however, White then proceeds to ig- nore Popper's use and discussion of quantum physics. Thus "clouds" embellish the title of White's paper, but not its content, except briefly and obliquely on page 23. Here, White interjects the caveat that "classical physics is taken as a prototype for the contemporary physical sciences, when in reality it may only represent the physics of a bygone century." This assertion, as we are by now quite aware, is mistaken on several counts. Classical physics remains highly relevant to most of what is done in the physical sciences as well as elsewhere in human life today, and relativity theory certainly represents the phys- ics of this century, but yet it is considered to be a com- ponent of classical physics?at least by physicists. White then cites Popper (1972, though to a later edition), who follows the classical physicist and pragmatic philosopher, C. S. Peirce, rather than any of the many quantum phys- icists who have propounded the indeterminist perspec- tive?and philosophically to boot(!). As Morowitz (1980: 15) points out, "The implications of the developing para- digm greatly surprised early quantum physicists and led them to study epistemology and the philosophy of sci- ence. Never before in scientific history . . . had all of the leading contributors produced books and papers ex- pounding the philosophical and humanistic meaning of their results." White does quote the Italian quantum physicist, Coc- coni (1970:87), but for a statement of what patently rep- resents not a quantum-theory but rather an evolutionary perspective: "The immutable laws of physics could be- come as 'ephemeral' as those of organic life, immutable only for observations limited in space and time, and even more exotic, the evolution of these laws would depend on history, a history that has followed a path that, to a great extent, must have been determined by chance." In con- text, however, Cocconi had prefaced the quoted sentence with the statement that "it is appealing to think that in the</page><page sequence="14">110 realm of high energies, situations could develop similar to those possible for molecules. . . . [But] the only justifica- tion today for this kind of science fiction is the observation of a great variety of endothermal high-energy reactions. . . ." The sentence immediately following the one quoted by White and completing the paragraph is: "Seen from this point of view, even the Heisenberg uncertainty principle could be considered a temporary consequence of laws establishing themselves in an undeterminable manner." And Cocconi quickly adds, "I realize that I have carried the argument to its extreme consequences and beyond, into the metaphysical sphere." Cocconi's main interest was in the query whether the high-energy phenomena of quantum physics could help to explain how life once began on this earth. Consciousness The facets of consciousness in which political scientists have tended to be interested relate to such matters as linguistic phenomenology and analyses of language that demonstrate in detail the extent and modes of observer bias as an inescapable consequence of the use of lan- guage to communicate. As Michael Shapiro (1981:55) remarks, "part of the impact of the phenomenological perspective is owed to the philosophy of mind it offers, one which conceives of consciousness as an active, meaning constituting process"?and one which, at least to that extent, is in considerable agreement with the role assigned to both mind and language by quantum physics (and see B?hm, 1980, eh. 7). A few political scientists have even begun to consider the effect of language upon thinking from the perspectives of the psychology of lan- guage and linguistic relativity (Landau, 1965) and of bi- olinguistics (Kitchm, 1982; Schubert, forthcoming/b; and cf. TenHouten and Kaplan, 1973, chs. 4 and 5; and Rogers, TenHouten, Kaplan, and Gardiner, 1977). Nancy Hartsock, a Marxist-feminist, claims (1979:57) that "not only is our theory implicit in our conception of the world, but our conception of the world is itself a political choice." This is a profound half-truth. Our conception of the world surely is a psychobiologically constrained political choice (and cf. Gould, 1980:49-51), and it is the transactional relationship between the psychobiological and the political that we must study if we are to understand political choice. White (1982b) discusses theories of consciousness drawn from contemporary psychobiology, although his attraction is to dualist theories of brain function such as the one that Popper co-authored with Eccles (1977). I have discussed elsewhere (Schubert, forthcoming/b) the holistic but materialistic theory of consciousness that is predominant in contemporary psychobiology (Morowitz, 1980:12) with particular regard to how this relates to human perception and to the thinking process with which the observer paradox of quantum physics is concerned. I have also discussed what such a theory implies for po- litical science. Steven Peterson (1982b) focuses even more explicitly on the question of neurophysiology and rationality in po- litical thinking and comes to conclusions highly supportive of the psychobiological perspective that has been pro- pounded here?that human perception is tuned to mac- roscopic physical events, but the human mind operates at the level of microscopic (particle) physics where the un- certainty principle operates pervasively. For the life sci- enees, the relevant "fields" are electrodynamic, to be sure, but in a fully materialistic sense they are in the human mind?no\ in any social or political or other ex- ternal reality. COMMENTARIES COMMENT ON SCHUBERT'S VIEW OF PARADIGMA TIC EVOLUTION: FROM THE RIDICULOUS TO THE SUBLIME, AND BACK? Hayward R. Alker, Jr. Department of Political Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 Glendon Schubert's present article has been hard for me to understand. It was first presented at an "outreach" panel of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences entitled "Dialogues on Biology and the Life Sciences" with Dina Zinnes and myself as commentators, neither of us being members of this promising new association. Presumably she was chosen because of her scholarly and editorial prominence in the political science profession. I because of my recent writings on paradigm controversies within and on the boundaries of the human (including the political) sciences (Alker, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1979. 1981. 1982; Alker and Hurwitz, 1981). From Schubert's article it is clear that he sees Sorokm's book aimed "at a liberation of sociology and the social sciences from voluntary servitude to the natural sciences ' as "polemical." My principal question on first reading his article was whether?and if so, why?Professor Schubert takes it for granted that politics ought to be studied as if its corresponding academic discipline were a deductively organized natural science capable of discovering univer- sally valid, logically and mathematically statable theories and laws. The general tenor of his laudatory discussions of contemporary physics and biology indeed suggests that Schubert holds to this view. Although the concluding</page><page sequence="15">111 section, "Quantizing Political Theory," states clearly enough Schubert's interest in "the implications for political theory of the acceptance and use in the study of politics of the paradigm of modern physics," I find his discussion of "decision-making," "the psychobiological paradox,' and "consciousness" difficult yet puzzlingly naive, im- pressive in its command of literature I do not fully under- stand, but as yet unpersuasive. I keep wanting to ask: how should I or other political scientists change the way they work as a result of the newest developments in physics (and presumably biology)? Having studied quantum physics and having been im- pressed by von Neumann's success in axiomatizing quantum theory, I am of the distinct impression that most modern physicists think of their subject in naturalistic, mathematical and deductive terms; but rather few of my own colleagues or of the physicists I have known see politics in the same way. Nonetheless, this issue has been at the center of much of the philosophical debate over the last hundred years about the appropriate directions for the historical and social sciences. Peirce, Bentley, Kuhn and Popper, Almond, Lasswell and Hobbes, Rummel and Shapiro are all cited by Schubert in this article, but none fully subscribes to this (and all other) cardinal tenets of logical positivism, at least as far as political science is concerned. With the possible exception of Hobbes, none of them appear to me to be naive "determinists" about human affairs in the strict sense that classical physicists have used the term. Nor have I seen many writings by these authors advocating the ontological notions of "ir- reversible causality, action by contact and absolute time." A related question concerns the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the Copenhagen interpretation of this feature of intrusive measurements, and the observer and psy- chobiological paradoxes (which appear to be heavily overlapping conundrums whether we use Comfort's for- mula of "matter thinking itself" or the highly reductionist and circular epistemologica! syllogism that Schubert quotes from Morowitz). Since Popper's related attacks against the early logical positivists' search for theory-free observational primitives are well known (are these the "classical epistemologists" Schubert has in mind?) and widely accepted (see Alker, 1982 for references), to whom is Schubert preaching? In terms that many social philosophers would use, do not the fascinating develop- ments within contemporary physics to which Schubert and Popper allude confirm the validity of the much older methodological idea known as the hermeneutic circle: "There is no development of knowledge without fore- knowledge"? (Radnitzky as quoted in Alker, 1982). Hermeneutics, phenomenology, dialectics?all these epistemologica! traditions are deeply critical of naively positivist theories of observation and data making; none accepts the outmoded view of scholarly "objectivity" that Schubert appears to be attacking. Who does? Since I have read a moderate amount about the philosophy and epistemology of the humanities and the natural and social sciences, I keep wondering which of the insights that are evidently so illuminating and persuasive for Professor Schubert are really new or fundamentally different from many similar points now widely accepted in that philo- sophical literature, at least as they bear on the conduct and productive rationalization of political science. Why doesn't Schubert cite the profound discussion of these issues by Hegel, Marx, Husserl, Dilthey, Weber, Wittgen- stein, Gadamer, Habermas, and Harre? Most of these authors and their correspondents have made points very much like those I believe Schubert wants young political scientists to learn, only they did so years ago, in direct discussions of humanistic, cultural, historical, social, and political science. Isn't there a lot more to these traditions of critical reflection than the search for "rational, theo- retical clarification and understanding [of] ... (a) the features of cosmogony and cosmology accepted as having been revealed ... 'by the grace of God' . . . and (b) the system of natural philosophy ... of Aristotle and the other Greek and the Arabic philosophers and mathe- maticians."? Are not superb teaching expositions of much of this literature like Moon (1975), Bernstein (1976), or Dallmayr and McCarthy (1977) a better and more ac- cessible way of developing politically relevant perceptual sensitivity than the three years of college math and physics necessary to understand modern quantum theo- ry? It was while rereading Schubert's article for the third time that I came up with the following hypothesis, which helps answer some of the puzzling questions mentioned above. For Schubert modern physics and biology (or biophysics?) are sublime scientific disciplines, but con- temporary political science is largely ridiculous. Although I agree with Professor Schubert that the writings of B?hm, Capra, Comfort, Danielli, Wheeler, and Zukav are sublime, I do not think that most political scientists are ridiculous! To be sure, Schubert does not use that word, but it helps a lot to make sense of his article and its curious omis- sions. To quote some roughly equivalent descriptions of my professional colleagues: "traditional" or "ideological" (rather than "scientific"); "prescientific," "prepara- digmatic," doing work that is "not an integrated science," practicing "pseudoparadigms"; "antiquarian" or "medi- eval" (i.e., part of "twenty-two centuries since Aristotle during which no noteworthy changes took place in either political theory or political methodology as applied in the systematic, empirical, scientific study of politics," my emphasis); describing APSA presidents as leaping "ag- ilely ... on Kuhn's bandwagon [striving] mightily to cling to his coattails?albeit with indifferent success"; calling to task a Marxist-feminist but not his Hawaiian colleague Michael Shapiro for stating that our world conceptions are political choices when both the Marxian tradition of the former and the Foucault-inspired approach of the latter are deeply attentive to natural scientific conceptions of sickness and health in "species man." Surely there are some real arguments to be made here, but the tone, like the puzzling omissions noted earlier, and several other anomalies or mistakes indeed suggest an underlying attitude of ridicule or contempt. I myself have criticized the too easily adopted self-image of political scientists as "paradigmatic" (Alker, 1976) without deny- ing that some subfields or sub-disciplinary "matrices," to use Kuhn's term, are maturely scientific. But the con- temptuous and inaccurate view of Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Petty (founder of "political arithmetic"), Rous- seau, Locke, Jefferson, and Madison will surely offend many of our colleagues, not to mention by name the Is- lamic, Indian, or Chinese scholars who flourished some time before Lieber and Burgess (!) institutionalized Politi- cal Science. And what are we to make of the claim that</page><page sequence="16">112 Herbert Simon is our profession's only Nobel laureate? Should Ralph Bunche and Henry Kissinger give back their awards because the truces they negotiated were later undermined? Should laureate Le Duc Tho not be treated as a political scientist because he was a diplomat well trained in Marxist-Leninist theory and practice? Do we demand of economist laureates perfect success for their practical endeavors? Is their practical work essentially unrelated to their scientific practice? There seems to be in evidence here a powerful aversion toward "policy sci- ence" and creative or emancipatory political engineering (Popper's preferred term, not mine), even though these styles of government or political science have long blended together normative and empirical aspects of po- litical inquiry. I have to admit that the organization of Schubert's ar- ticle at first also escaped me. But when I thought of the hypothesis summarized in the titles of my comments as possible organizing ideas underlying his article, much of its back and forth quality came into focus. See if the fol- lowing table doesn't help you, my reader, as well. Schubert's section titles My thematic summary (from and select subtitles the ridiculous to the sublime, _and back)_ 1.

Quantizing Political The- Back down to earth again, ory hopefully doing a little bit bet- ter than Rashevsky, Deutsch et al., given repeated divine infusions I think this table makes transparent Schubert's aspira- tion that the ever increasing sublime science of (bio)- physics will, through regular infusions, slowly raise from ridicule poor old political science. If this interpretation of the intellectual rhythm and thrust of Schubert's argument is accepted as basically valid, I believe my reasons for finding Schubert's views unper- suasive, even professionally offensive, should be clear. It is arguable (but not obvious for those like Harre preferring an "anthropomorphic model of man") that significant advances in empirical political science can occur through the infusion of epistemologica! orientations and concep- tual insights from the physical and life sciences. Indeed the most impressive efforts along these lines, in my view, surely include the works of Hobbes (his powerful rejection of Aristotelian ontology in favor of Galilean mechanism and an early variant of utilitarian thought), Leibniz (who reformulated and synthesized Aristotelian, Aquinan, and mechanistic thought in his monadic ontology), and Marx (who considered himself a HegeHan, but wished to dedi- cate Capital to Darwin). Note that all of these writers worked after Aristotle and before Burgess. Schubert's unargued, contemptuous view of the previous twenty-two centuries of political thought prevents him from arguing persuasively with me for the fecundity of such an intel- lectual move. If we cannot learn from the successes as well as the failures of these scholars, current efforts along similar lines are not likely to succeed. Despite my difficulties in sympathetically understand- ing, and trying to reach consensus with Professor Schubert on his views, this episode in my voyage of cross-paradigmatic understanding has had a happy end- ing. It has given me an occasion to read further into constructional biology than I had previously done. The fascinating dualities of structural representations, the monadic way in which parts of systems contain wholes, the "constructivist" reading of nature and natural science are for me fascinating pieces in the larger enterprise of developing a more adequate, humanistic understanding of natural and social scientific activity. For this occasion to Glendon Schubert I am particularly grateful. Also, the chance to talk with some very articulate evolutionary survivalists has definitely been rewarding. Last but not least, I was given a copy of Volume 1, Number 1 of this journal by Thomas Wiegele. I agree with each of the major points made by Samuel Hines (1982a) in the lead-off ar- ticle, and find Schubert's commentary thereon about the interconnections of normative and empirical theorizing (1982b) similarly ridiculous. Perhaps that means that I too am a biopolitician, at least in the cybernetic mode (see Alker, 1981)! WINNING FRIENDS AND INFLUENCING PEOPLE: A COMMENT ON SCHUBERT'S 'THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL SCIENCE" Dina Zinnes Department of Political Science University of Illinois Urbana, Illinois 61801 To place this comment into the proper perspective I must begin with a disclaimer. I have never worked in the fields of psychobiology or political psychobiology. Indeed, until relatively recently I was totally unaware of work in the area of political psychobiology. Second, although I have con-</page><page sequence="17">113 siderably more familiarity with certain aspects of the broad field of physics and related areas of research, I have at best only a lay person's understanding of the work in that area. Finally, I am conversant with the issues of philoso- phy of science, but my training in this area has largely been as a practitioner, a user rather than a contributor. Thus it can be fairly said that I have at best a nodding acquaintance with the three principal themes that run through the article by Glendon Schubert. Why then am I commenting on this article? When originally approached to serve as a commentator I noted my limitations. It was suggested, however, that it was precisely those limitations that were of interest. As a contributor to and consumer of political science research, generally unfamiliar with the work in political psy- chobiology, would an article like "The Evolution of Political Science: Paradigms of Physics, Biology, and Politics" convince me of the value of this relatively new area of research in political science? Thus my role, as I under- stand it, is to examine the Schubert article from the per- spective of a neutral bystander: am I convinced by Schubert's argument that political psychobiology can and will make a major contribution to our understanding of politics? After a brief overview of what I understand to be the highlights of the Schubert article and some discussion of specific problems I encountered at various points of the argument, I will then turn to the central question and at- tempt to assess the extent to which I am or am not con- vinced. An Overview and Some Questions Schubert appears to be making three basic points. First, political science does not currently have a commonly accepted paradigm for its research efforts. Although it might be argued, and indeed Schubert wishes to so argue, that prior to the "behavioral revolution" there was at least the semblance of a paradigm in the institutional approach to the study of politics, that paradigm has long since been obliterated by "behavioralism." Unfortunately, "behavioralism" tended to wipe out the former paradigm, but it did not produce a new paradigm to take its place. Thus the field of political science is currently paradigm- less. Second, Schubert argues, without a paradigm the re- search efforts of the field are bound to be fragmented and non-cumulative. As such, the discipline will limp along in a somewhat random fashion. It is essential, then, that the field find itself a new paradigm. Finally, Schubert's third point is that the basic nature of psychobiology is such that if properly adapted to the study of politics it could provide an exciting, fundamental paradigm capable of organizing much if not all of political science research. Schubert's argument in favor of psychobiology as the new paradigm proceeds through a description of the evolution of physics and biophysics and through extensive reference to various principles taken from the philosophy of science. The purpose of this quasi-historical narrative is to demonstrate the meaning and importance of a para- digm and to set the stage for the contention that psy- chobiology is a paradigm of considerable generality and thus of relevance to political science. I have three basic difficulties with Schubert's argument. First, I have considerable problems with the word para- digm as standardly used in political science. Unfortu- nately, these difficulties are not alleviated by Schubert's examples or analyses. In my "layman's" approach to this concept, I think of a paradigm as a set of core related questions together with some basically understood and accepted concepts and an agreed upon approach to the study of those questions. The difficulty I have with Schubert's argument then is that he does not seem to be using "paradigm" in this way. If the prebehavioral insti- tutional type of political science was a paradigm then I am puzzled as to what basic questions it was asking, and considerably surprised to learn that it contained basic concepts generally understood by all (terms like "power," basic to at least some forms of institutional analysis, were hotly debated). It is not only Schubert's use of paradigm to describe certain schools of political science that I find troublesome. I am also troubled by the contention that psychobiology might provide a paradigm for political science because this contention is argued more in terms of the approach that psychobiology might provide for political science and almost not at all in terms of the core and therefore or- ganizing questions that it would provide the field. Thus the principal argument that seems to be made in favor of psychobiology as the new paradigm is that it is "basic," i.e., that questions asked at other levels can always be translated into finer-grained questions at the psy- chobiological level. That may be, and it may be valuable. But I have difficulty seeing why that makes psychobiology a paradigm. Where are the core questions? It appears that what is being shown is that anything said in one language (political science) can be reduced to another (psy- chobiology). But this makes psychobiology a medium, a language?not a paradigm. Thus I do not really understand Schubert's use of the word paradigm. There is, of course, no reason why he must use my definition of paradigm. However, if I am to understand what it is that Schubert finds missing in con- temporary political science research, and even more im- portantly, if I am to become convinced that the missing link is supplied by psychobiology, then it is imperative that the key concept, paradigm, be defined explicitly. Further, it is important to demonstrate: (1) that prebehavioral political science met the definitional criteria for a paradigm, (2) that behavioralism destroyed the old paradigm but did not provide a new one, again with reference to the definition, and (3) that psychobiology could meet the definitional requirements for a paradigm in political science. My second problem with Schubert's argument is the extensive discussion of various aspects of physics. I am unclear as to the message behind the presentation. Al- though I can identify at least three possible morals in these arguments, I do not see how they explicitly relate to the contention that psychobiology is a valuable paradigm. Thus Schubert appears to be arguing for (1) considerably more attention to carefully constructed, logical arguments probably through the use of more mathematics, (2) the desirability of developing probabilistic rather than deter- ministic models, and (3) the importance of developing and testing laws. All of these are certainly desiderata for po- litical science that I would strongly endorse, but it is un- clear to me why I need psychobiology to achieve any of</page><page sequence="18">114 them. The implication seems to be that the above goals could be achieved more rapidly/efficiently through the adoption of psychobiology. However, since other fields managed to achieve all three of those goals without psychobiology, I have trouble accepting such an argu- ment. My third problem with the article's argument is similar to my second. As I am puzzled by the extensive reference to various areas of physics, I am equally unclear as to what lessons I should learn and how I should apply them in the case of psychobiology from the many references to principles of philosophy of science. Philosophy of science precepts are typically extracted by examining what has taken place in certain areas of science. Unfortunately, these areas of science are often rather different from political science. Although they may provide interesting guidelines, it is dangerous to accept these precepts without question, as if they were generally relevant to any field of inquiry that wishes to be scientific. Each area of inquiry has its own special problems, problems not nec- essarily found in such areas as physics. Thus principles basic to physics may not be relevant to political science. An obvious difference between physics and political sci- ence lies in the area of data acquisition. Many of the problems of interest to a political scientist, especially in my field of international politics, cannot be studied in a labo- ratory, under controlled conditions. We are thus at the mercy of "naturally generated" data if we wish to study certain questions. This means that principles used for developing and testing theories in physics cannot unquestioningly be transported into political science, and new precepts germane to the special context of political science need to be generated. The philosophy of science also tends to be a "back- ward looking" field of discourse. The principles it gener- ates are frequently acquired by examining how certain areas evolved. This means that in some senses the phi- losophy of science is always fighting the last war and not preparing itself to meet the new challenges. Thus, again, it is not clear to me what I can or should learn from the philosophy of science concerning the conduct of my own research or the development of the field of political sci- ence. Winning Friends and Influencing People Am I convinced? Intrigued, yes. Convinced, I really don't know. I guess I am neither convinced nor unconvinced. Psychobiology may well have something very valuable to offer political science, but I cannot be convinced of its value through reference to physics and the philosophy of science and the implication that because psychobiology meets the precepts set forth by these areas it will rescue political science. Having been there myself, I can well understand Schubert's missionary zeal. He feels strongly about po- litical science, is convinced that it is not going in the right direction, and is equally sure that he sees an answer. I feel strongly about another approach, the use of mathematical models. Some years ago, I too spent a good deal of time trying to convince others of the value and significance of mathematical modeling. I suspect that my frequent frus- tration in not being able to convince others is shared by Schubert. However, several years ago I learned an im- portant lesson. I read an article in sociology which used a Poisson model to study urban riots. I was struck by the fact that the article did not bother to set forth extensive reasons for why mathematical modeling was important or useful. It described the basic question of interest, noted the previous research that had been done, and, even though the literature in that area was totally unfamiliar with the application of mathematical models, simply went ahead to propose the model. Having stated the assump- tions and demonstrated the deductions, the author went on to test the hypotheses and was able to show that the application of this model provided considerably more understanding of the phenomenon than had previously been the case. The moral that I drew from that experience is that it is not in the saying but in the doing that one produces a convincing argument. If you can show that a new ap- proach, paradigm, or whatever, provides you with greater understanding, more insight, and increased predictability, then you have a powerful argument. If it works, then others will be eager to jump on the bandwagon. To be convinced, then, I want to be shown what it is that psy- chobiology can do with some fundamental questions of political science that can not be done without it. If psy- chobiology allows us to "fly" where before we could only walk, run, motor, or cycle, then I will certainly be among the first to welcome its arrival. AUTHOR'S RESPONSE TWO VERSIONS OF PASTORAL, FROM A TO ? The two commentaries are alike in that both misconceive my goal in writing this article to be to convert each of them from her or his respective accustomed workways, to the acceptance of a new paradigm, which Zinnes interprets as a novel methodology, and Alker as a freshly revealed faith. Such a lofty ambition never entered my mind, and nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the proxi- mate reason for my undertaking the enterprise is that a group of my friends and associates in the recently orga- nized Association for Politics and the Life Sciences be- seeched me?and on pretty short notice?to present the first in what was planned to be a series of annual panel presentations, the goal of which would be to promote a continuing dialogue (and hence, a close intellectual rela- tionship) between our group and the rest of the profession of political science. For me, the persuasive reason for writing the article is that I have been waiting, and none too patiently, for more than two decades?ever since I first</page><page sequence="19">115 read, on the heels of its publication, Martin Landau's (1961) "On the Use of Metaphor in Political Analysis"?for someone to take a serious crack at exploring the impli- cations for politics, of the metaphor (Weltanschauung) of modern physics. After his initial brilliant critique of the limitations of classical physics as the paradigm for the American constitutional polity (Landau, 1961; and cf. Robinson, 1957), Landau went on to explore some of the implications of organismic biology (Landau, 1965, 1968; and cf. Roberts, 1938), in counterpoint to the then-eva- nescing Eastonian "systems theory" in political science. But I could never persuade him to take the next?as it seemed and seems to me?obvious step, of attempting to consider the implications for the conceptualization and investigation of political theory and behavior of a more contemporary paradigm reflecting the natural-science understanding of the place of humans in the biosphere, the physical world, and the cosmos. So it was rather by default than in fulfillment of any lifelong purpose that I decided that, if I wanted to be able to consider during my own professional lifetime such a discussion of modern physics as a possible model for contemporary politics, then I had better write it myself, taking what advantage I could of the gracious opportunity provided by the invita- tion of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences to launch my tiny rocket (which I shall call, with unabashed modesty, if little originality, "The Peacemaker") from an appropriate platform. Candor, however, compels the ad- ditional admission that I have never considered the study of biology and politics (which is of central concern to APLS) to be more than a complex way-station on the route to the better understanding of human political nature. What / get out of the subject article is an appreciation of the unity among quantum physics, neurobiology, and political psychology. Having returned to the starting place, I know it for the first time. Both commentaries are alike also in that there is no internal evidence that either Alker or Zinnes has troubled to look into the research and writing on biology and pol- itics of political scientists during the past two de- cades?work which constitutes the foundation on which APLS and this journal were built. (Alker's patently cursory inspection of the initial issue of this journal, which was sent to him by its editor, does not constitute a relevant exception, as we shall see below.) Such action on the part of the commentators would of course be indispensable to the joining of any dialogue between neophytes and afi- cionados about the relationships between biology and politics. Such a dialogue was a major goal of APLS in sponsoring and organizing the Denver panel, so no doubt in this respect the exchange of views must be deemed a failure. I am to blame because both commentators were invited to participate in the panel and dialogue at my own suggestion, well before actual work on this article was even begun. At that time, I had never met or spoken with either of them but knew them only through their profes- sional work and activities. I recommended them because of their preeminence as highly intelligent, independent spokespersons for the profession. There is also no internal evidence that either com- mentator undertook, before the panel meeting or subse- quently, to investigate either the literature of modern physics or that of political psychobiology, to both of which numerous references are provided in the article. It is, therefore, not surprising that both find it impossible to engage in any meaningful dialogue with the article on which they purport to comment. Thus, both commentators profess, and evince, their great difficulty in bringing themselves to discuss the thesis I raise on its own terms, which are: what (if anything) can political scientists learn from modern physics; and how can they use it? I believe that I appreciated how audacious the mere raising of that question was likely to be perceived, given the ideological premises into which our profession is socialized; but neither caricature and ridicule nor confessions of con- tentment and protestations of disbelief are intellectually satisfying as rejoinders to the assertion that brain science will help political scientists better to understand political thinking and hence political choice. Both commentators are alike in that each takes up the available space with a dialogue reminiscent of that between the walrus and the carpenter, speaking of many things (on a par with cab- bages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot) before ultimately concluding, on the one hand, that psy- chobiology is intriguing although it may be premature to decide what it can do for political science, and on the other, that psychobiology has an important role to play "in the larger enterprise of developing a more adequate, humanistic understanding of natural and social scientific activity." Any article that can induce the latter response, however belated, from Z, the incumbent editor of what many political scientists consider to be the profession's leading journal, and also from A, who is the very paragon of flamboyance and grandiloquence in the articulation of political intellectuality?such an article can't be all bad. The two commentaries do differ markedly in style, re- flecting the markedly diverse personalities and manners of their authors?a difference which, incidentally, I do not attribute primarily to inherent or characteristic differentials in what has now come to be called "the sexual brain," (see Konner, 1982), and also in content. It will be most convenient, therefore, to reply to them individually, and to that end, I propose to reverse the alphabetical sequence, proceeding instead from ? to A. Among other things, this puts ladies first?and if any reader perceives this to be evidence of male chauvinism, may she or he, as the case may be, make the most of it. Z. Is Dale Carnegie the Answer? Persuasion versus Elucidation Near the end of her commentary (para. 13), Zinnes re^ marks empathetically of my "missionary zeal." Whatever her proper role in this colloquium may be, such an attri- bution betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how I define my own role, on the panel and in the article. Mine is that of an ethnologist who reports to his own (academic) culture the behaviors he has observed among aboriginals he has visited?not that of a missionary on home leave who uses his field experience to reinforce his attempts to spread the gospel among indigenous unbelievers who are also his own compatriots. Her role, as she understands it (para. 2), is to examine my article to answer the question: "am I convinced by Schubert's argument that political psychobiology can and will make a major contribution to our understanding of politics?" However, I have never said, either in the oral presentation of the paper in Denver or in its written version</page><page sequence="20">116 here, that my objective was to convince her by presenting arguments in defense of a thesis. Of course, I am not privy to what passed in discussion about the article between her and the editor of this journal; but I personally disavow any such conceptualization of our present dialogue. My goal in the article, I repeat, is to inform, perhaps to pro- voke, but certainly not to convince. One doesn't write an article focusing upon relativity physics and quantum me- chanics with the expectation of winning friends from among a contemporary audience of political scientists. As for influencing people, if Zinnes finds herself, as she herself puts it, "intrigued"?then I have succeeded as much as I ever wanted or expected to do. I'm sure she didn't intend her concluding paragraph to sound patronizing (or matronizing), but it certainly comes off that way. None of us (including readers) needs to undergo the present exercise in order to learn that hu- mans tend to be more readily and sincerely convinced by deeds than words, action than braggadocio, and quanti- fied empirical data than research designs. Of course the proof necessary for conviction lies in the pudding, not in its recipe (to say nothing of advertisements of the latter). However, for any particular human group (and certainly for political scientists, in the present instance) the prob- lem, at least in the beginning, of inquiry that moves in a novel direction, is that people don't undertake research without templates (schemata) to guide them. As my paper points out, it was Einstein who remarked to Heisenberg that it is the theory that tells us what to look for. My paper is about questions of theory. The empirical evidence, if any, will have to come later, in due course. To demand proof positive before inquiry even begins is not merely unscientific; it is preposterous. Imputed Arguments It is Zinnes, not I, who asserts (para. 3) that the institu- tional approach to political science has been "obliterated" or "wiped out" by behavioralism. I consider such an as- sertion to be errant nonsense, and indeed it is a point of view (as represented in Dahl's 1961 article in the Ameri- can Political Science Review that I explicitly criticize in my article. The position that I do assert is that behavioralism co-exists with several other approaches, all of which are attractive to various contemporary political scientists. In the subfield with which I have been longest associated, for example, there has been a revival of enthusiasm for tra- ditional constitutional (and even administrative!?see Schubert, 1958) law, especially among younger political scientists during the past decade. Most practicing judicial behavioralists are survivors of earlier academic genera- tions. As I explicitly state, political science today is char- acterized not by the lack of any paradigm, but rather by competition among some half a dozen paradigms. Our profession is not decapitated; it is headed by Hydra Zinnes also claims (para. 4) that I argue that without a paradigm the research efforts of the field are "bound to be fragmented and non-cumulative." This is the authentic voice of an earlier and on-the-make behavioralism, one that patterns itself after sociometrics and psychometrics. Although I cannot deny that I said such things in my youth, I certainly say nothing in the present article about more systematization and quantification being the remedy of our "limp[ing] along in a somewhat random fashion"?nor do I say or believe that our professional behavior is either crippled or random. It is apparent that neither Zinnes nor Alker bothered to take a look at Crombie (1961), on whom I rely so heavily in the introductory section of the article, beyond what I myself quote from him there. If either of them had gone to that slight trouble, then she or he might better have understood (than either now does) what I tried to explain there. We are distinguished from the natural sciences, not by our stupidity, not by our inhumanity, and surely not by our slothfullness. Political science, like all of the other social sciences, remains in a prescientific stage (at least, as "science" is defined by Crombie) because of the vastly more complex task that confronts us students of human behavior, as compared to the task of physical scientists, or even that of biologists (except for those whose subject animal is Homo sapiens sapiens. Precisely what most distinguishes humans from other forms of life that biologists study is the human brain. What I suggest is that it would possibly be fruitful for the study of politics if more political scientists (or at least some political scien- tists) understood and attempted to work into their re- search biological (as well as psychological) models of human brain function. This in turn, if it is to be other than dilettantish, requires at least an elementary understanding of relativity physics and quantum mechanics. I don't say that we have to do it; I don't say that we are necessarily going to do it; I say we might learn something new if we tried. I'm so pessimistic about the kind of handle we now have on the control of the political process, relying as we do on the knowledge base that Alker takes such over- weening pride and joy in, that I have no great confidence about our getting to 1984, to say nothing of the ten to twenty years that it would take even if we started right now, to produce appropriately interdisciplinary-educated political-science/psychobiology doctorates who might be able to undertake serious research along the lines that I have merely adumbrated. Maybe Alker picked up the appropriate kind of educational base as an undergraduate at MIT; certainly neither Zinnes nor I, nor more than a handful at most for the entire population of living political scientists, can make such an educational claim. Con- ceivably, Alker is a scientist in terms of Crombie's defi- nition; but the bulk of us political scientists most assuredly are not. Empirical Arguments Zinnes challenges (para. 6) my assertion that there was a single generally accepted paradigm (in the sense in which I use that concept in my article) in American political science from, say, the first decade of this century when the American Political Science Association was estab- lished, up until, say, the outbreak of World War II, a period of about thirty-five years. I have tried to give full credit to others (Somit and Tanenhaus, 1967; and cf. Landau, 1972) whom I cite in the article as authority for the position I accept there, but I'm not going to take such an easy out to avoid the thrust of her comment. What basic questions was prebehavioral institutional political science asking, Zinnes wants to know? Unlike either Zinnes or Alker, I grew up and was educated in prebehavioral institutional political science, and I cannot (like them) take the so- called behavioral revolution for granted. However, I really think I have paid my dues when it comes to analyzing and critiquing the belief structure and workways of traditional political science, with particular reference to my own</page><page sequence="21">117 subfield of public law?including several articles that were published in the journal that she now edits (e.g., Schubert, 1957, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967a; and for a more up-to- date example, see Schubert, forthcoming/c)?so I com- mend her to those references for at least a partial answer to her question. However, her remark, that political sci- ence's lack of consensus about the definition of "power" (at least for purposes of institutional analysis) demon- strates the absence of a traditional paradigm, provokes the short answer that it deserves. In suggesting that an- swer, I cannot avoid alluding to an approach to knowledge concerning which her understanding and opinion are dif- ferent from mine (and see the section, "Philosophy of Science," immediately below); so this response also may not seem either persuasive or convincing to her. The fact that institutional and behavioral political science rely on fundamental terms that remain largely or completely undefined says nothing about whether either approach constitutes (now or formerly) a Kuhnian paradigm for the profession. Even real sciences (in Crombie's sense of the word) do that, and necessarily so; thus, biology limps along with such central notions as "life" and "gene," much as psychobiology does with "mind." Zinnes thinks (para. 9) that I appear to be arguing also for (1) a mathematically based political theory, such as is exemplified by the late Robert MacArthur's magnificent Geographical Ecology (1972), or by Charles Lumsden and Edward Wilson's something-less-than-magnificent treatise on human sociobiology, Genes, Mind, and Culture (1981; and cf. Schubert, 1982a). It happens that I do strongly believe in the usefulness of such an approach for certain purposes, but I make no such assertion in the present article because its application to psychobiology for or by political scientists in any proximate future seems to me to be so remote. She thinks that I argue in the article for (2) "the desirability of developing probabilistic rather than deterministic models," and this is half right. I don't want to throw out all deterministic models (which would be stupid), but we already have lots of them, and what we don't have lots of are not merely probabilistic models but those that seek not to eliminate or reduce chance but rather to accept it and use it as an integral part of the theory. She thinks also that I argue in the article for (3) "the importance of developing and testing laws." Laws? Indeterminate ones?? I don't say anything about prolife- rating more legality in the article. She endorses all three of these ideas, strongly; so I want to make clear that all three are hers, and only the second is partially mine too, for present purposes. She then wants to know why she needs "psychobiology to achieve any of them." This puts the cart before the horse; she needs both deterministic and probabilistic models to understand psychobiology because that is how human perception and cognition work (cf. Pribram and McGuinness, 1975). This is one reason why I try in the article to discuss //7determinism in relation to quantum theory and psychobiology?that is what quantum theory's "the observer paradox" and the psy- chobiological theory of human perception are all about (Livingston, 1978). I don't say these are simple matters; I do say they are worthy of being studied. Zinnes argues (para. 10) that "an obvious difference between physics and political science lies in the area of data acquisition. Many of the problems of interest to a political scientist . . . cannot be studied in a laboratory under controlled conditions." This, however, reflects far too narrow a view of both physics and my discussion of it in the article where I am at least generally concerned with relativity and quantum theory. Astronomy is surely a branch of physics, and it most certainly is?at least to the extent that international relations is?a field of science. Moreover, astronomy is the field par excellence for the empirical testing of relativity theory. Relativity theory, quantum physics, certain Eastern religions, and con- structional biology coalesce in psychobiology (Zukav, 1979; Capra, 1975; Crook, 1980), and a major point to my own paper's discussion of quantum physics is that the "control" (of which Zinnes speaks) is tautological, de- pending as it does so completely on both human per- ception and conceptualization. Philosophy of Science Zinnes worries (para. 11) about what she considers to be the historicity of philosophy of science, and it is not clear to her what she can or should learn from philosophy of science concerning the conduct of her own research or the development of political science as a discipline. That's up to her and certainly will depend on her understanding of philosophy of science and political science. My use of Crombie (1961) to analyze one?certainly, one among many?possible futures of political science is not "back- ward looking," and in any event, nowhere in the article do I advise her or anyone else to study the philosophy of science. I merely use it to get at my own subject in the paper. Psychobiology What are the issues here? What are the core questions? Why are they important? Zinnes throws these questions out (para. 7) as though she has utterly no idea what might constitute reasonable answers to them. The article, how- ever, cites another contemporary work of mine (Schubert, forthcoming/b) which, in the light of these demands for answers, I feel impelled to point out she ought to be inti- mately familiar with. It is a paper that deals extensively with what are at least attempts to discuss and answer the very questions to which she now clamors for immediate response. She ought to be familiar with the paper because she recently examined it, in her role as managing editor of the American Political Science Review. She had every right to reject that paper but not without having herself read it, in which case she (unlike present readers, to whom she poses the queries) was and is among the few political scientists who should be privy to the answers it provides. It has now been accepted by a different political science journal for publication after some revision is completed, but I can cite, for the benefits of any suffi- ciently interested readers, two earlier versions of the paper, both of which are now available (Schubert, 1981, 1982c) and do answer the questions Zinnes raises. What I get out of this is that she is not more convinced by what I say in the present paper than by what I said in the one that she rejected for publication; but that brings us, tautologically, back to the discussion with which we began. For purposes of that other paper, I certainly had to convince her, and failed; here, I have neither such an obligation nor such an intent. It's a new and different.ball game, and it entails different rules than does functioning as a managing editor.</page><page sequence="22">118 For other readers, I shall also point out that I do cite much of the extant literature in political psychobiology in the present article (e.g., Cory, 1974; Davies, 1963, 1969, 1976; Geigle, 1977; Laponce, 1978; Manheim, 1982; Peterson, 1981a, 1981b, 1982a, 1982b; White, 1980, 1981a, 1981b, 1982a, 1982b). Readers are just as free as Zinnes was and is to look into the cited literature for more detailed answers to her questions than the concluding section of the present article provides. To indicate here but a single explicit example, Doris Graber presented papers at both the Midwest Political Science Association meeting in April (Graber, 1982a) and the Denver APSA meeting at which my article was first presented as a paper (Graber, 1982b). In these papers she demonstrates em- pirically the extent to which political perception in practice involves the avoidance and ignoring of available political information. She is familiar with the social science work on schemata theory in cognitive psychology. There is no evidence in her papers that she is privy to the psy- chobiological theory in brain science per se. Peterson picks up her April paper as a reference in his August paper (Peterson, 1982b), thereby demonstrating his awareness of the extent to which her empirical survey research?standard political behavioral work?supplies evidence highly supportive of the theory of neural tem- plates that he discusses in that paper. Indeed, anyone who (like me and my graduate students in a seminar in political behavior this past autumn) has read both the Graber paper (1982b) and the Peterson paper (1982b) is struck by the impressive extent to which Graber's facts and Peterson's theory fit like hand in glove. If this isn't science in the sense of Crombie's definition of it, at least it is as close as we currently can get to such science in contemporary political science. A. The Angelic Doctor's Summa Theologies I have tried to take seriously Dina Zinnes's commentary (which is another reason for putting ? first). It is not going to be easy to deal at the same level of dispassion with Hayward Alker's Thomist discourse, although I am going to try to avoid the posturing and grandstanding?if I may say so, judging from his performance not only at the Denver panel but at others in which I have observed him in action?that seem to mark his style of expression. At the panel his exhibitionism extended to leaping out of his chair in order to peer behind mine, in order to direct the attention of the audience to the T-shirt that I was wearing, one that I had acquired earlier that month in Atlanta at the meeting of the International Primatological Society (of which I happen to be a member). I had removed my suitcoat, it is true, because it was a hot afternoon. The back?not the front?of the T-shirt is decorated with an artist's realistic drawings of the faces of half a dozen different nonhuman primates, plus that of a human female. The intent of the artist, I believe, was to symbolize the cross-species unity with which members of the society are conjointly concerned. No one sat behind me at the panel, and I was making no effort either to publicize or exploit my primatological connections, but Alker was beside himself- ?literally as well as figuratively?with the apparent but needless concern that I might try to upstage him in con- spicuous display. I guess his intent was to defuse my monkeys to preclude the possibility that I might try to use them to detract attention from him. Not to worry; I may be audacious but I'm not crazy. Ad Hominem, ad Nauseum All that I need or wish to do on this subject is point out that Alker persists throughout his commentary in characteriz- ing me pejoratively, disparagingly, repetitively, and with a limited vocabulary of emotion-laden adjectives. I may have missed some instances because I counted only once, but his remarks include at least the following direct references to me: "naive" (para. 2), "preaching" (para. 4), "ridiculous," and also "ridiculous!" (para. 6), "ridicule or contempt" and "ridicule" (para. 8), "professionally offensive" and "contemptuous view" (para. 9), and "similarly ridiculous" (para. 10). Maybe this is the way points are scored in the debating club in which he was trained, but I expect that for readers of this journal it may appear that Alker needs Dale Carnegie even more than I do. Reductio ad Absurdum Alker says (para. 2) that I presume "a deductively orga- nized natural science capable of discovering universally valid, logically and mathematically statable theories and laws," but this is Alker's straw man. I don't think that and I don't say that anywhere in the article. Alker's assertion is partly a consequence of the fact that neither he?nor Zinnes, who made a similar claim?has an adequate comprehension of quantum mechanics and particle physics. Both argue on the basis of the classical physics in terms of which each of them (necessarily) understands physical reality. My point in writing the article, which has eluded both of them, is that political scientists ought to consider the implications of a different view of the world, one based on a conception of physical reality that is the opposite of the sentence quoted above. There is clearly a circular problem here. They can't understand it if they won't expose themselves to its exposition, and clearly I can't presume to be a qualified expositor, nor do I. I can and do say: you might learn something different if you look into X more carefully, after which you might be persuaded of the merits of X. Both A and ? say: we don't believe in X and you can't make us. By defining his own issues for discussion, indepen- dently of what I discuss in my article, Alker might present himself in a more entertaining manner than he could if he stuck to what I do say in the article, but no relevant issues can be joined?as he himself deplores passim, in self- fulfilling prophecy?for present discussion. For example, his commentary is replete with innuendos such as (para. 5) "Schubert appears to be attacking." This stuff is all in his head for reasons that psychobiology might make clearer to him?if he would only open his mind to it. Later in the same paragraph, Alker quotes in fragmented form (that I have abridged further here) "rational theoretical clarification . . . Arabic philosophers and mathematicians" without attribution as to source, but with the implication that I am responsible for the quotation in my zeal to cram math and physics into the tender minds of political science undergraduates. The quotation is not from me but from Crombie, and Crombie uses it to help describe the intel- lectual posture of prescientific medieval physics. Alker claims there is a lot more to medievalism than Crombie</page><page sequence="23">119 directs attention to in the quotation (fragmented by Alker), This is a subject on which I have no personal expertise, and although I'm willing to concede that Alker may spend a lot of time exploring the roots of medieval physics (which is preoccupied with such studies as alchemy and astrology) as the basis for his understanding of politics, A. C. Crombie was an Oxford historian of science when his paper was written a quarter of a century ago, and in any dispute between Crombie and Alker, even on the issue as Alker defines it, I feel impelled to repose my own confi- dence in Crombie's view. It is true that the point of my use of Crombie is to suggest that there are striking parallels between the intellectual postures of political science now and medieval physics then, but Alker doesn't want to discuss that. His concern is with praising the virtues of medieval thinking. He also does everything possible to insinuate that / am a logical positivist; whereas in fact?and in faith?I am no more that than he is, as his terminal enthusiasm for con- structional biology should have made clear to him, but didn't. In looking up the programmatic statement by Har- vey Wheeler, Jim Danielli, and others, Alker might have noticed (but didn't) that I am a founding member of the board of editors of the journal in which that prolegomenon appeared, and editor Harvey Wheeler can (and I'm sure would) testify that I saw and commented most favorably upon the statement in draft long before it was published- ?behaviors entirely inconsistent with the logical positivist orientation that Alker tries to foist off onto me. What he still doesn't comprehend, his empathy for it notwithstanding, is that proponents of constructional biology are the very persons (including also Alex Comfort, David B?hm, Karl Pribram, and Robert Rosen) who are among the leading contributors to the use of quantum theory in psy- chobiology, as my paper tries to make clear, and certainly does explicate. I welcome Alker's discovery of "fasci- nating pieces in the larger enterprise of developing a more adequate, humanistic understanding of natural and social scientific activity" (para. 10), but unless he is content to define his relationship to that new field of inquiry in ex- clusively dilettantish terms, Alker is going to have to take the bitter with the better. He can't embrace constructional biology in any serious way without also cozying up to both psychobiology and quantum theory. They may seem to him to be strange bedfellows, but that's the way it is. He can't have the one without the others. Illogical Positivism The Alker commentary is replete also with misstatements, as well as misunderstandings, of what?for want of a better shorthand concept?I'm going to refer to as "facts." Not the least of Alker's factual misunderstandings is his evident presumption that logical positivists can/do believe in "the observer paradox," as I myself patently do. There are so many of these fact issues that I'm going to select only three as examples, listing several others without discussion. Hegel, Marx, Wittgenstein, etc. did not (and in their writings, do not) anticipate the major theoretical theses of Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Bell, and B?hm?Alker to the contrary (para. 5) notwithstanding. My colleague, Mike Shapiro, is not a Hawaiian (para. 6); he is a haole (white) resident of Hawaii. (This is, to be sure, a banal observation, but it is at precisely the same level of banality as much of Alker's argument.) As for Foucault and the Marxist tradition having something in common, I commend Alker to Jim March's exemplary discussion (1956) of whether an umbrella corresponds with, more than it differs from, a blackboard. March re- marks (not surprisingly) that "between any two objects one can cite a whole class of similarities and dis- similarities," but if Alker doesn't like to accept such a notorious behavioralist as an authority on the question, ?? settle for the corresponding argument of that celebrated Victorian mathematician, Charles Lewis Dodgson, whose suggested example was why a raven is like a writing- desk. In his concluding paragraph, Alker indicates that he agrees with all of the major points made by Sam Hines (1982a) and disagrees with my ridiculous comments on Hines (Schubert, 1982b). He initiates that remark with the phrase "last but not least," which is not only hackneyed but also factually erroneous?it is last and least. It is ap- parent that what he read in the first issue of the journal is all that he knows about biopolitics, and I submit that Alker is really in over his head here. My own points of difference with Hines all relate to the history of the subdiscipline during its first decade as an organized movement, and they all concern matters of fact in which I was a partici- pant-observer and Hines was not, and regarding which I assert in my comment (Schubert, 1982b) that I can pro- duce better evidence than Hines was able to get at If anything would seem to be "simply ridiculous," it would be for omniscient Alker to profess an opinion about questions of historical fact that he himself inescapably knows nothing about. Other such fact-issues include the following. Is Sorokin (1964) a "polemical volume" as I assert and Alker dis- putes (para. 2)? Surely, this can be resolved by consulting the professional reviews that appeared when the book was published. Does political behavioral work of the fifties and sixties often presume irreversible causality, action by contact. and absolute time (para. 3)? Many "classics'' of the era leap to mind (Almond and Coleman, 1960:17: Murphy. 1964:32; Easton, 1965:112), but in any case I have sur- veyed that literature (Schubert, 1976) and so has Wahlke (1979). Alker refuses to distinguish (para. 7) as my paper clearly does, between the development of political science as an organized professional discipline and writing about politics during the two and a half millenia preceding the establishment of the American Political Science Associa- tion or between the behavior of political scientists and the behavior of politicians in public life. Democntus is not the propounder of the uncertainty principle in any technical sense (and cf. Jaynes, 1977), and none of Nixon. Carter and Reagan are political scientists?however meritorious their political achievements and the recognition they re- ceived therefrom. Whether Alker likes it or not. or accepts it or not, my article is about institutionalized political sci- ence. Whatever one may think of his praise of great po- litical thinkers and great political leaders, it is off the subject.</page><page sequence="24">120 Bound to Win In his ultimate sentence, Alker toys with the speculation that he is, perhaps, a biopolitician. That seems to be clearly wrong, given the self-portrait that he provides throughout the preceding commentary, but he certainly is, as he also says, a cybernetic politician. As the thrust of Zinnes's argument emphasizes so strongly, my article was not written as a platform in support of my campaign for high professional office in, say, the American Political Science Association; but the under- and overtones of Alker's commentary (such as his para. 7 by which time he has managed to work up a pretty good head of steam) makes one wonder about his own cybernetic political aspirations. Alker wastes virtually all of his commentary on a defense of the glories and virtues of the study and practice of politics past and present. By definition, this is a very conservative position for him to rest his case upon. My article was intended to open windows for its readers, not to send them to the ramparts to defend the glorious humanistic past of the study of politics throughout the ages. My article is directed toward provoking a discussion about a possible future of the discipline of political sci- ence. All Alker wants to talk about is its past, which haunts his heavenly city of politics much as the ghost of the royal Dane stalks the windy passages of Elsinore?but there is an answer to that kind of political thinking: Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. ?Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Act I, Scene 5. ?Glendon Schubert References Alker, H. R., Jr. (1974).
