<plain_text><page sequence="1">Portugal: A Book of Folk-Ways. By Rodney Gallop. Cambridge (U.P.), I96I. Pp. xvii, 29I. Price Ji 5s. 171 This is a reprint of a book printed in I936, but not then noticed in MAN. It was well worth reprinting, for Gallop, who had published a valuable book on Basque folklore, made a thorough study of Portuguese folk culture, both by personal investigation and from the printed sources. Most of the superstitions now or formerly current in England are found in Portugal, including were-wolves, the 'hand of glory' and four-leaved clover, and most of the seasonal rites are similar, Much of the book is taken up with the cult of the saints, especially St. John the Baptist, to whom the whole month ofJune is dedicated. The author goes on to deal with songs, dances, ballads and in particular the rhymed quatrains, of which 'upwards of sixty thousand have already appeared in print.' Mrs. Gallop, whose charming sketches adorn the book, says that if her husband had lived he might have changed or modified some of his theories, and indeed the book contains far too many theories masquerading as facts. It is inconceivable that, as he suggests, all mankind changed over at one stage from Frazerian magic to Tylorian animism, that is from spirits nowhere to spirits everywhere, and it is not a fact that 'it is possible to trace in Portuguese folk-belief the gradual evolution of religious thought through animism and poly- theism to anthropomorphic monotheism.' And his statement in the text that 'In the last resort all art-music is eventually derived from primitive folk-song' does not square with his approval in the preface of the view that 'all folk-cultures are the popularization of something that was once aristocratic-music, poetry, costume, dance.'
