Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1985. x + 259pp. $39.50.-As Andrew Martin notes in his introductory chapter, the title he has selected for his volume poses sig- nificant problems. It implies a subject as vast in time and space as the universe or as profound and enigmatic as the intellect. Indeed, such an essay must begin with Genesis or before and can end anywhere and nowhere. That he chose to culminate his essay with Jules Verne, though startling, is understandable once one has grasped the book's structure; yet Verne is not really the end of the book, because he merely represents a writer whose work embodies man's desire for omniscience while demonstrating that the more man knows the more he recognizes his ignorance: The Voyages, anticipating the closure of the circle of knowledge, the attain- ment of omniscience, aim to supplant mimesis by mathesis, deploying science to abolish fiction. But the Vemian savant is always threatened, in the course of his journeys of intellectual discovery, by the catastrophic reduction of science to nescience. (pp. 6-7) But it is not just man's recognition of his ignorance; it is an understanding that nescience and omniscience are not opposites but reversible processes: "the frag- mentation of scientific discourse suggests that knowledge and ignorance, science and literature, epistemophilia and anepistemophilia, are not mutually exclusive but inseparable" (p. 7). Thus Martin's book can have no real ending in any writer or period. Indeed, the book itself cannot end as discourse, because discourse and time are inseparably linked within the transition between nescience and omniscience. Both discourse and time are imperfect fragmentations of man's attempted under- standing of a universe which, because it is beyond his understanding, he describes as infinite and eternal, static states in which time and transition have no meaning and can never become means of comprehension. After all, in the sense of Godhead omni- science and nescience become meaningless terms. They are linguistic formulations by which man attempts to describe and define something beyond his comprehension. For even in employing such expression as "all" and "whole," "omniscient" and "infi- nite," man is clearly thinking in finite terms. The whole implies something that can be encompassed and omniscience suggests that there is an all to be known. Man can only perceive in terms of transition; he thinks in terms of time and he measures space, as if one moved from nothing to something. He conceives of the universe as a place and thinks that it is an ark or archive, a definable entity which one can explore and hence move from ignorance to full knowledge. Thus, as long as man is man, Martin's book can have no ending, for an ending would represent a natural conclusion to a creature of transition who can only think that all things in transition must have a beginning and an end. Although to include the name of Verne as the conclusive term in such a high- sounding title causes one to draw back for a moment and to wonder about the</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IN REVIEW 401 author's seriousness, there is no doubt that Martin is serious and has written a very provocative and interesting volume which, though by no means attempting to discuss all of Western literature and civilization in terms of his theme, does so in a philosophical way by choosing a perspective which reflects broadly these opposite but not opposing paths to knowledge or understanding: nescience and omniscience. In an abstract sense one might say that there are three modes which describe man's understanding of essential forms: at one end of the spectrum are vacuum, absence, and ignorance, in themselves forms of perfection because unique and whole; on the other end are plenitude and omniscience, which, by their complete- ness, are also images of perfection. What lies between, of course, is a transition from one state to the other, a temporal mode which represents the imperfect state of man. In his chapter entitled "Nescience and Omniscience," Martin focusses on three historical moments in Western civilization: Genesis, the Renaissance, and the French Revolution and its aftermath. For Martin, genesis is both a moment in philosophical time and an event which has specific significance in intellectual his- tory. As an event, it represents the perfect moment of ignorance for humankind, a period prior to the use of language when man, in his total ignorance, formed a per- fect unity with his Creator. In fact, the omniscient Creator's need for creation is presented as deriving from his need to know all, even ignorance. Once man had acquired knowledge, of course, the perfection of complete ignorance was lost. Indeed, once ignorance was lost the way to perfection or to rejoining the Creator could only lie in complete knowledge. Thus the Scriptures represent man's hesitant attempt at reconciliation with the Godhead and yet are themselves emblematic of the cleavage which exists between man and his Creator. The Renaissance is presented as a period in which man believed in knowledge, a period which sought to recover the lost knowledge of the ancients. Yet, for Mar- tin, figures like Erasmus and Montaigne realized the futility of attempting to learn all and manifested a skepticism regarding the ability of man's intellect to know. And in Rousseau he sees the dilemma of humankind caught between a nostalgic desire for complete ignorance or innocence and the desire for omniscience expressed perfectly in Julie: Thus La Nouvelle Heloise operates as a sexual parable of the dilemma of epis- temic man. The anepistemological ideal examined in Rousseau's writing, of attaining the state of knowing without the impediment of knowledge, of being simultaneously ignorant and knowledgeable, is mirrored in Julie's exactly analogous fantasy of loving without ever having loved, of possessing without being possessed, of being an amorous virgin. (p. 54) For Martin, Julie is a "post-lapsarian being clinging to the illusion of prelapsarian innocence" (p. 54). But if the 18th-century revolution was anti-intellectual in its political ideology, the aftermath of bourgeois dominance reinstated the goal of omniscience and sci- ence. Ignorance, which Renaissance and post-Renaissance man relegated to a peri- od of time called the Middle Ages, came to be located in the 19th century in the Orient, the spatial equivalent of the Middle Ages. In sections dealing with Hugo, Napoleon, and Chateaubriand, Martin explores 19th-century Positivism and the idea of Western intellectual and cultural superiority-this in a chapter entitled "The Occidental Orient." Here the volume becomes less philosophical and more literary and historical in orientation as Martin traces the 19th-century belief in sci- ence and knowledge in the poetic imagery of Hugo, the ideas of Beaudelaire and Chateaubriand, and the political plans of Napoleon.</page><page sequence="3">402 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 14 (1987) Finally, in the longest section of the book, Martin discusses various formal patterns and subjects in the ceuvre of Jules Verne which reflect his works' concern with the question of science and the universe, fiction and reality. He explores Verne's use of emblematic images (such as the shark in Les Enfants du capitaine Grant), "reflexive images duplicating in miniature the configuration of a text or texts, emblematic re'sumes of plot or theme" (p. 123). He relates Verne's use of themes such as nutrition and cognition to his own central thesis and he demon- strates the key role that Vingt mille lieues sous les mers plays in the work as a whole. Not only does that work itself epitomize the novels in the entire collection in Martin's view, but the Nautilus is a microfigure of the Vernian opus. It is both ark and museum, a seaborne encyclopedia, a well-ordered closed space both tem- poral and aesthetic: "it is the physical counterpart to the closure of history that is the prerequisite of epistemic totalization..." (p. 155). For Martin, Verne's fiction is itself modelled on the Nautilus: "it is a library of quotations, allusions, references: a bibliography of nineteenth-century science" (p. 156). Perhaps one of Martin's more telling observations regards Verne's relation to SF as a genre. As Martin notes, Verne was very skeptical of fiction and the wholesale use of imagination, especially in regard to the material world. If what man perceives was subjective in Verne's view (a traditional 19th-century neo-platonic perspective), the universe was, contrarily, an objective reality which science attempted to appre- hend in its absolute quality. Thus Verne admitted readily the use of fiction in creat- ing plots and characters but absolutely refused to venture beyond current scientific knowledge or speculation when dealing with the "objective reality" of the uni- verse. As Martin puts it, the descriptible is bounded by what has already been described, while the scriptible is identical with the dej'a-ecrit. Thus Verne's SF maintains a strict distinction which prevents futuristic fantasizing from becoming part of his narrative: "Verne's scientific romances are less futuristic fantasies than nostalgic perrnutations of inherited categories and contraptions" (p. 6). Verne's De la terre a la Lune and Autour de la Lune prove amply the accuracy of Martin's observation. Nothing Verne says about the Moon or the means of getting there exceeds current scientific speculation on the known. Moreover, when such specu- lation was lacking, he tended toward hasty generalizations rather than elaborate fantasies. But if Martin's book provides much material that is insightful, there are also problems one should not overlook. One may readily question von Rad's reticence at seeking a divine purpose in God's prohibition that man not eat of the tree, but to assert that the prohibition involves acquisition of knowledge itself is questionable. After all, for man to live as a conscious human being would involve learning and thought. In the chapter on Genesis, Martin struggles to maintain the binary struc- ture he posits. He turns away from useful historical interpretations of Genesis that had enormous influence on the minds and art of subsequent periods. At times one finds sophistic questions which depend on an anthropomorphic image of God. To show that God's omnipotence and omniscience are in fact defective (to be omni- scient one could not know ignorance), he makes up several things that God could not do: he could not, e.g., build a wall over which he could not jump. It is one thing to say that no wall could be built which God, taking the shape of a man, could not jump, but to make image of the infinite creating something outside of itself is to think of the infinite in human terms. To say that omniscience cannot know ignorance is to give substance to ignorance or to imagine that omniscience cannot know ignorance without becoming ignorant or in some way taking on ignorance, thereby destroying omniscience.</page><page sequence="4">BOOKS IN REVIEW 403 In Martin's treatment of Montaigne there is a similar problem. Interesting as Martin's binary use of omniscience and nescience is, it does not seem that Mon- taigne's critique of raison in the Apologie de Raimond Sebond involves the question of nescience. To be sure, Montaigne's alleged apologia undercuts the argument it seemingly sets out to support. But his skepticism of man's raison only involves the challenge of raison in questions of theology or faith. There is no denial of leaming in the Renaissance concept of physical science. It may be surprising to find, but Montaigne's essay is in the great tradition of theological discourses, in the tradition of Abelard's Sic et Non and consistent with his loud proclamation that he never intended to question faith with man's reason. In the discussion of the 19th-century idea of the "mission civilisatrice" of Westem Europe (here France in particular), Martin readily condemns this train of thought as a sham. To see the idea as a hoax by means of which Westem capitalism could justify itself in taking from other societies what rightfully belonged to them is to misconstrue history. (A similar gross error in the interpretation of crusading moti- vation in earlier medieval scholarship is being rectified by the scholarship of the past three decades.) The "mission civilisatrice" has a long history which extends at least to Chretien de Troyes' preface to Cliges and the sense that both clergie and cheva- lerie now belong to France and must be maintained and transmitted. By the end of the 17th century, the belief in France in its own moral, intellectual, and artistic supe- riority over the rest of Westem Europe should not be underestimated. It is this great sense of classic art in aesthetic matters which allows Eugene Fromentin, basically an anti-colonialist by the standards of his day, to watch a native festival with great interest, even fascination, but to proclaim that it is really not art, only spectacle. (It is curious to me that modem critics, often consumed by the idea that there can be no absolute history, nonetheless refuse to acknowledge the legitimate historical biases brought about by relativism and proceed to criticize earlier generations for not sharing the relative bias of the modem age!) Our age is currently experiencing an anti-scientific reaction, an abhorrence of the 19th century's faith in progress and belief that science can solve all human problems. The idea that acquisition of knowledge could be a prototype for the very notion of possession is interesting. This mode of thought may well be at work in an abstract intellectual sense. But the historical consciousness of the period should be taken into account in assessing such motives. To conclude, one may return to the appropriateness of using an author of Verne's stature as the culminating essay in a book involving questions so philo- sophically oriented. Until the 1970s, Veme was perceived almost exclusively as an author of adventure books, largely thought of as an author who appealed mostly to children. Since the early 1970s, however, many critics have begun to focus on his works seriously. Is it the case of a novelist long misunderstood whose time has finally come? Probably not. It has rather to do with the change in values of modem literary criticism. Post-1960s' criticism has eschewed the traditional 19th-century novel and its preoccupation with psychology and history. The idea that history is nothing but a record left by people hopelessly prisoners of their own biases has tumed history into a form of fiction and prevents one from considering history in the absolute terms in which it was conceived in the 19th century. Thus documents are seen not so much as historical bearers of fact as they are the observations of peo- ple living in another age. In a completely relative perspective, even science becomes only a mathematical reflection of man's own necessarily biased and limited perspec- tive on the universe. As C.S. Lewis noted in his The Discarded Image, the Copemi- can model is not the permanent, absolute reality of the universe; it is an image which</page><page sequence="5">404 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 14 (1987) answers for our time. Martin notes that Veme's work comes at a turning point in Western thought: "The Voyages register the transition from the subordination of fiction to a scientific view of literature (as mimesis) to the subordination of physics to an aesthetic view of science (as imaginative construct)" (p. 174). With this end of the last bastion of an absolute reality (the physical sciences), modern criticism has, in a sense, turned to itself as a kind of science: Science, then, does not so much resemble literature as both resemble literary criticism. Thus in philosophy the dominion of epistemology has tended to be usurped by hermeneutics. The ambition of literary criticism to be a science, to reconvert hermeneutics into epistemology, betrays a nostalgia for a lost para- dise. (p. 186) In a sense literary criticism is left unto itself to analyze texts in whose authors and historical subject matter it has no faith or real interest. Verne is not read as an author whose preoccupations were caught up in the idea of 19th-century notions of progress and science. The 19th century is not looked at to see how it differs from or lays the foundation for our own historical and intellectual perspectives. Nor is Verne the figure, the man, the author really of interest. Rather Verne's ceuvre becomes a vast document which has its own absolute raison d'e?tre that tran- scends or is apart from history. This is why Simone Vierne's study of mythic, ini- tiatory archetypes, More's psychoanalytic study, and Macherey's Marxist analysis of Verne all more or less work in terms of the structured guidelines these authors set forth as the basis for their works. What is fascinating in the second half of the 20th century is the way in which literary criticism is becoming a genre, practically the only genre in which it is itself interested. As literary criticism seeks to become a science, it creates absolute forms which it denies to other areas of intellectual endeavor. The critic seeks to move to a plane beyond history (which she or he sees as inevitably relative and hopelessly enmeshed in man's psyche) to a beyond which, as Martin so aptly writes, "betrays a nostalgia for a lost paradise." But to move beyond in this way really places man's intellect in the supreme and isolated place which the Positivists claimed as one of the principal errors of the age prior to what they called the "modem period." Our paradoxical refusal to take into account the observations of the mind and senses of others and yet give credence to the workings of our own intellect is narcissistic in the extreme. Our exclusive interest in ourselves and our own views is an ironic form of absolutism in an age which pretends to itself that openmindedness is an admirable and desirable quality. Martin's book is stimulating, interesting, and entertaining. It is richly suggestive and casts much light on Verne's work as a whole. At times it suffers from the self- conscious and self-indulgent narrowness of our own age. This derives, in large part, from the belief in our own superiority, a superiority which rests upon the firm and smug conviction that we know that man's striving for knowledge can only lead him to the conclusion that he knew as much before he started as he will know when he has finished: that in man's hopelessly relative view, nescience and omniscience real- ly amount to the same thing; that the Knowledge of Ignorance and the Ignorance of Knowledge are phrases which are not only compatible but nearly mean the same thing.
