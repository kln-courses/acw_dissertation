<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zbornik Historijskog Instituta Jugoslavenske Akademije, i. Zagreb, Yugoslavia, 1954. Paper. Pp. 479. METICULOUS methodology and superior scholarship are characteristics of this first volume of collected studies published under the auspices of the Historical Institute of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. It contains eleven essays and two documentary items, all by mature historians. The Zbornik is beautifully printed and well edited. The first essay, "History and Dialectical Materialism" (pp. 5-24), is by Marko Kostren6ic., a leading Yugoslav legal historian. The author explains the Marxist interpretation of history, and gives his reasons why history should be written on this basis. First of all, he discusses various theories of history, and concludes that nearly all of them have contributed something to the study of history. The "bourgeois historians" enhanced the field of history through their collection of voluminous historical data, and by their development of historical technique. Nonetheless, he says, all non-Marxian theories served the interests of the bourgeois class as "ideological means of rule," and all have in common a single idea - fate, udes, fatum. In Kostrencic's opinion the bourgeois theories of history are static rather than dynamic, and they have failed to resolve the most of the fundamental problems in history, which (accord- ing to the author) could be done only with the aid of dialectical materialism. Kostrencic argues that the Marxist historian should not ignore the "bourgeois theories" of history, because there is "a seed of truth in each of them." The Marxian historian should not ignore God, although he must not understand God as an anthropomorphic being endowed with eternity and omnipotence, but as an idea - "a very interesting social phenomenon, which was created by human society" (p. 21). Vladimir Mosin, distinguished Yugoslav mediaevalist, discusses the "Study of Watermarks as an Auxiliary Historical Science" (pp. 25-93). This is a heavily documented study in which the author shows with ample illustrative data how the study of watermarks can serve the science of history. Mosin traces the devel- opment of the study of watermarks through the nineteenth century and assesses the work of leading authors in the field. He tells something of the history of paper and the techniques by which the dates and other relative information of the wa- termarks can be ascertained. Mosin believes the works of Ch. M. Briquet (1907) and N. P. Likhachev (1899), excellent though they were as pioneering efforts, have become antiquated, and he urges the revision of these works and publication of data discovered since their appearance. The Historical Institute of the Yugo- slav Academy of Sciences and Arts, he writes, is preparing a handbook on water- marks of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries, located for the most part in the archives of Dubrovnik and Zadar. In an article entitled "Catarensia" (pp. 95-109) Antun Mayer traces the origin</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 221 of the name of the coastal city of Kotor. The seventh-century geographer' refers to Kotor as "Decaderon," compounded from the words De and Caderon (Greek Cadaron and Latin Cadarum or Catarum). However, the form "Kotor" appears for the first time in the "Life of Stefan Nemanja," which appeared in the Pamdtky drevniho pisemnictvi Jihoslovanu2v (Praha, 1851; 2nd ed., 1873). The evidence shows that the name Kotor has a pre-Slavic origin, and the author refutes various theories regarding the Slavic origin of the name. The oldest written source on Kotor is dated in 1166 and deals with the consecration of the church of St Tripun (Triphon). The next oldest source, a document dated 1200, of which only a copy of the original is now available, is located in the archives of the Yugoslav Academy. - Jakov Stipisic discusses the "Development of the Split Notary Office" (pp. 112-123) and shows how after the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Roman legal system, under the influence of new social and political conditions, under- went a considerable modification. According to this Marxist scholar, a change from a slave-holding to a feudal social system was inevitably accompanied by a change in legal institutions. Along the Yugoslav coast, the cities that were spared the Slav invasion (Zara) developed their Notary on the foundations of the old Roman institution. Other places, like Split (Spalato), abandoned the Roman Notary tradition and developed their own system under Lombard influence and commercial and cultural contact with Northern Croatia. After.the fall of Salona, Split became a peripheral region, exposed to constant attacks. The new legal norms emerged under the influence of Croatian customary law and certain indigenous practices to form a special type, a Dalmatian-Croatian system. The development of the Split Notary can be traced from the first quarter of the eleventh century and goes through three stages of development - primi- tive scribes, sworn communal Notary, notarius imperiali auctoritate. Leo Kosuta comments (pp. 125-135) on the "Location of the Benedictine Mon- astery 'Montis Garbi' on the Island of Losinj." It seems that the Annales camaldu- lenses (Venice, 1755-1773), the principal source for the history of the Benedic- tines-Camaldolites, refers to the monastery at the top of the Mount Garbo on the island of Losinj. No historian, however, has been able to verify the fact that such a monastery existed, and, if it did exist, where it was located. Viktor Novak and the local historian Silvio Mitis were unable to resolve the question. On the basis of new materials, Kosuta believes that he has definitely established the fact that in the eleventh century there existed on Mount Garbo an independ- ent abbey of St Nicholas with a Camaldolite hermitage, and that it declined to a status of priorate, comprising the monastery of St Nicholas and hermitage of St Mary Magdalen, by the fourteenth century. Kosuta further shows that "Garbo" is a corruption of Gaybo, and that the terms "Osorsvcica" and "Gaybo" refer to the same place. Vjekoslav Stefani', one of Yugoslavia's foremost experts on Glagolitic script IThe so-called anonymous geogripher Qf Thvenna.</page><page sequence="3">222 Reviews and literature, analyzes "Two Frankopan Glagolitic Charters to the Paulicians" (pp. 137-148). The charters, written on parchment, dated 1372 and 1452 re- spectively, were grants made to Paulicians by Zigmunt Frankopan. They repre- sent two of many documents on the Crotian Paulicians that have been preserved. The language used in the charters is the Jakavski form of Croatian, with residue of earlier Church language. A number of Glagolitic documents were published by Ivan Kukuljevic in the Acta Croatica. The two documents which Stefanic translates explain the system of grants, the organization of the Paulicians and the rights they enjoyed. The author also analyzes the texts of the charters from a linguistic standpoint, and says that they represent the oldest examples of Glagolitic tachygraphy. The author includes in his article a transliteration of the charters and the facsimiles of the originals. Stefanic contributes another article in which he analyzes three Glagolitic charters of the Notary Ivan Mantakovic from Bagka (pp. 149-153). Two of the charters were dated 15927 and one in 1514. The author analyzes the content of the charters in search for additional data on the history of the Croatian Church, which used in its services the Croatian-Slavonic tongue, written in the Glagolitic script. The article includes facsimiles of the original charters and the translitera- tion of the charters. Miljen gamgalovic discusses the "Diplomatic Mission of Senj Bishop Jozefic in the Year 159.6-159.7" (pp. 155-168) on the basis of new documentary materials. The author first describes the battle of Mohacs, (929 August 15526), at which a "hastily gathered" Hungarian-Croatian fuedal army, under the command of Louis II, was defeated by "a modern and organized Turkish force." Samsalovic supplies us with interesting details on the aftermath - the struggle between the Habsburg ruler Ferdinand and the Hungarian feudatory Ivan Zapolja for the throne of Hungary and Croatia. In order to win foreign support, Zapolja sent diplomatic agents to various foreign powers. The Senj Bishop Franjo Josefic was sent to the court of the French King Francis I. The author tells us why the Senj bishop was selected for this important mission and in general discusses the policy of Zapolja. Seid M. Tra]jic writes on the "bosancica" - a Cyrillic alphabet used in writing the Turkish language. Ciro Truhelka had written on this subject as early as 1914. But he and others who dealt with the subject (Elezovic, Mosin) were of the opinion that this form of writing was rare. Traljic believes that it was in wider use than hitherto believed. He 'analyzes "Palinic's Bosnian Collection" (pp. 169-187), written at the end of the sixteenth century, and now located in the Archives of the Yugoslav Academy. The first part of the collection is hardly more than a copy of the "Illyrian Heraldry." The second part contains a number of songs written in Turkish. In "The Correspondence of the Republic of Ragusa with Nikola Frankopan and Petar Zrinski" (pp. 189-222), Vladimir Ko'cak analyzes several hitherto unpublished documents from the Ragusa Archives on the relations between North Croatia and Dubrovnik in the mid-seventeenth century. The documents throw light on various obscure points in history, including the recruitment of</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 223 Ragusan armies in North Croatia and the cooperation between Ragusa and Petar Zrinski, who headed the conspiracy in Croatia and Hungary against Leo- pold I of Austria. The author's discussion of the seventeenth-century rivalry in the Adriatic among the different powers is of particular interest. Mirjana Gross writes on the "Collapse of the Old Unionist Party in the Light of the Report by Mirko Bogovic" (pp. 29293-49). This article is based on the ma- terials of the literateur Mirko Bogovic (1816-1893), whose papers were filed in the Archives of the Yugoslav Academy. In his youth Bogovic was a fiery Illyrian in political sentiment, follower of Jelacic and enemy of Bach's absolutism. As he grew older his political beliefs changed and by 1861 Bogovic became a passionate Unionist, member of the Rauch's clique, and one of the leading representatives of the right wing of the Unionist Party. The author is primarily concerned with the appraisal of the political aims of the Old Unionist Party and their attitude toward various issues affecting Croatia, and only incidentally alludes to the reasons why Bogovic abandoned his original political convictions. A very large portion of the Zbornik is taken up by Lujo Savor's listing of certain documents from the archives of the Keglevic family, 1700-1853, hitherto un- classified. The archives of the Croatian noble family of Keglevic were sold to the Yugoslav Academy by Count Samojlo Keglevic in 1867; they contain about 6,000 documents and consist of papers of the Croatian and Hungarian kings from Vladislav II to Joseph II, papers of the bans of Dalmatia-Croatia-Slavonia since the thirteenth century, nearly 2,499 missals of higher clergy, and miscellany. Savor's collection is entitled Acta Keglevichiana (pp. 251-406). Ivan Erceg writes on "Sisic's Notes on the History of Croatian Diets in the Sixteenth Century" (pp. 407-479). These notes are a manuscript written in 1918 or 1919 by Ferdo Sisic, entitled "The Croatian Diets 15927-1605." They are filed in the archives of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences at Zagreb. Erceg corrected Sisic's notes and supplemented them with additional information on the sixteenth- century Croatian diets. The articles published in the Zbornik vary in character; some are interpretive and others are documentary. Some articles are of general interest and others deal with specific questions concerning the local history of Croatian regions or dis- tricts. The Yugoslav historian does not interpret history with quite the dogma- tism characteristic of the Soviet historian. He often goes beyond rigid Marxian interpretations. Needless to say, the non-Marxist as well as Marxist scholars can benefit from the important contributions published in this first volume of the Zbornik. WAYNE S.
