<plain_text><page sequence="1">Don Florence, Persona and Humor in Mark Twain's Early Writings (Columbia and London, University of Missouri Press, 1995, $34.95). Pp. 166. isbn o 8262 1025 2. Humor, by definition, is indefinite and nebulous ; in hooking it on to the vagaries and multiplicities of persona, Don Florence organizes a challenge that, notwithstanding his evident enthusiasm for all things Twain and Clemens, this book is almost never able to meet. The dust jacket implies that there are to be two further volumes: one on the "middle" writings and another on the "late." Given the endless iterations and attenuations of a comparatively undetaining argument in this first volume, together with a full adumbration of things to come, they already seem problematic. Florence's principal focus is on Clemens' early journalism, The Innocents Abroad, and Roughing It. The argument is that, in the western journalism, Clemens "develops an assortment of perspectives and humorous techniques;" lacking, however, is a "persona sufficiently flexible to encompass them easily." The unconvincing supposition is that Clemens sought such a persona, and that this was the determining element in some kind of narrative involving the movement from an inchoate Mark Twain, all incoherence and mechanical dualities, to one characterized in this book as "an elastic envelope for a play of humorous responses." The Twain of The Innocents Abroad, whilst "more intricate and inclusive" than in the early writings, is "still not always able to master his subject matter." Such mastery, for Florence, would have taken the form of recreating "the Old World to fit the demands of humour and narrative." In Roughing It, "Twain becomes the supreme shaping force of the narrative," the "arbiter of what meaning is, of what reality is, of what humour is." Here, and throughout, Florence is unabashed when it comes to the confident negotiation of global</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 469 abstractions. Clemens cannot allow his "narratives to lapse into chaos before us." The struggle, in Roughing It (the metaphor is Florence's) is to prevent volatility from developing into evaporation. The Mark Twain of the "later narratives" is more "distinct," "defined," and "pronounced"; earlier, and especially in Roughing It, the "protean" and the stability of the persona seem to be at odds. The worry for Florence, if not for Clemens and his other readers, is that Clemens might have overlooked that "behind Mark Twain's humorous cogitations must be a humorous cogitator" (a banal, even theoretically prehistoric, imperative). The Clemens-Twain relation is pivotal to this book's project; yet it is explored in only a murky kind of way. Wayne C. Booth's concept of the "implied author" is appropriated as somehow akin to Florence's sense of Twain as a "persona." Booth everywhere makes it clear, however, that for him, "implied author" and "persona," let alone the narrating "I" to which Florence's discussion is largely confined, are far from conterminous categories. Florence concedes that "we may not always strictly equate persona with implied author," for Booth, though, such an equation is impossible. Initially, the book is happy with the notion that "narrative, persona, and implied authors are all linguistic constructs," but its subsequent analysis is anthropomorphic nevertheless. Florence often finds himself trading in what reads like commonplace observations, even crass generalizations; I suspect that, in part, this is the consequence of trying to achieve a winning style. It is as difficult to react to the idea that the "self is subjective by nature," as it is to the announcement that "death is the ultimate helplessness." What does the reader gain from being told that "all metaphors have their common ground in the imagination"? More seriously, perhaps, it is difficult to take the crude way in which irony and humour run together in Florence's argument. Socrates and Kierkegaard (the book is fond of such forages) are attributed with the "ironic dissolution of conventionally accepted reality," yet Twain "uses his ironic humor to suggest that life is more illusory and protean than commonly believed." The move from "irony" to "ironic humour" goes undetected. Beyond this, however, the smudged use of "convention," "reality," and "commonly believed" (by whom?) are typical of a book that is too much at ease with itself.
