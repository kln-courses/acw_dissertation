<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lenten Eels and Carnival Sausages1 Barbara C. Bowen IN CHAPTERS 35 - 42 of the Quart Livre, Pantagruel and his fellow voyagers are attacked by and do battle with an army of Andouilles2 —a kind of cooked sausage you can still buy in French charcuteries. These Andouilles have mistaken the travellers for allies of the monstrous Quaresmeprenant, who is their natural enemy. After a fierce skirmish, the Andouilles surrender and give hostages, and Pantagruel sails away to the Isle of Ruach. The whole episode is fascinating from many points of view. The linguistic discussion in chapter 37, in particular, has provoked much interesting comment, most recently by M.A. Screech in an impor tant passage of his book on Rabelais.3 My aim in this paper is to explore further the actual battle with the Andouilles, in the context of the age old confrontation between Carnival and Lent. I. Carnival opposed to Lent. The sources of the battle episode are varied, and I have discussed many of them elsewhere.4 One of the most obvious is the battle between Carnival (Mardigras or Shrove-Tuesday) and Lent. The monster Quaresmeprenant is clearly Lent, and we assume therefore that the andouilles stand for Carnival. The most cele brated battle between Carnival and Lent is of course Brueghel's painting of 1559, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In the centre fore ground of this lively picture, a pot-bellied Carnival sits astride a barrel mounted on a sled. There is a poultry pie on his head, and he flourishes a roasting-spit with a pig's head and several roast birds on it. The sled is being pushed by two oddly-dressed clowns, and there are others in his entourage, wearing strange masks and playing on home-made musical instruments. 1.

Her (?) headgear is a beehive, her weapon a flat shovel with two fish on it, and around her feet are mussels, pretzels and assorted Lenten food. Many of the activities on her side of the picture are suitable for Lent, especially the giving of alms, while on Carnival's side people are dancing, performing carnival plays, and so on. We think of this confrontation as a traditional artistic subject, and so it is—but only after Brueghel. The Jacques Lagniet engravings of the 17th century reproduced in Demerson's edition of Rabelais,5 for instance, depict Caresmeprenant as a woman hung around with fish and pretzels, about to do battle with a Mardi-gras seated on a barrel, and equipped with frying-pan, spit with roast bird, ham and wine cup, a necklace of waffles and a garland of dead game. One of his attendants is a fool with cap and bells, and another wears what looks like a necklace of sausages. The only known visual representation of this 'battle' before Brueghel is an etching of 1558 by Frans Hogenberg,6 which is thought to be Brueghel's immediate source. Carnival and Lent have here the same respective positions, and are both seated on carts. But Hogenberg's confrontation is genuinely warlike; some of the supporters of each protagonist are already scuffling in the centre of the picture, and all are threateningly waving weapons—saucepans for Carnival, fish for Lent. The late appearance of this theme in art is extremely curious. In literature, the idea of a pitched battle involving food and/or kitchen utensils is a permanently attractive one. In Lucian's True History monstrous creatures fight with mushrooms for shields and stalks of asparagus for spears, and hurl radishes at each other; and in Alice Through the Looking Glass Alice arms Tweedledum and Tweedledee with saucepans for their important battle. Even the specific theme of a combat between Carnival and Lent is already old in literature by 1558. The most sophisticated French medieval example is the 13th-century fabliau De Caresme et de Charnage,7 a parody of the chansons de geste. Here two barons, Charnage who is rich and popular, and Quaresme, "le felon, Qui moult est fel et anïeus" 5. Guy Demerson, éd., Rabelais: Œuvres Complètes (Paris: Seuil, 1973), pp. 662 - 3. 6.

Quaresme's supporters are live fish of many kinds including eels, pois au lart ("Qui vienent sor frain chevauchant"), tripe, butter, pastry, cream and cheese. His armour is made of salmon, lampreys and other fish, and the cercles of his helmet is "d'anguilles rosties." He uses a sole for a sword and fish-bones for spurs, and his mount is "un grant mulet bien enselé"—a delightful pun. Charnage, mounted on a stag, has troops of both live and roasted animals, including: De bones saussices pevrees Qui noveles ont aportees Des andoilles, qu'eles vendront Et de la moustarde amenront. (228- 31) During the battle "une grant route de saussices" is attacked by . . .une avalison D'anguilles qui sont en seson, Qui aus saussices se meslerent, Deus granz arpens les reculèrent. The battle is fierce and bloody, and Quaresme loses (in one version he has to become Charnage's hom). Most critics agree that this is the liveliest version of the battle in the Middle Ages, but the generally best-known is no doubt the Pelea que ovo Don Carnal con La Quaresma in the 14th-century Libro de Buen Amor by Juan Ruiz.8 Here Don Carnal's retinue includes live poultry, joints of meat, cheeses (or perhaps blood pudding9), deer and other animals, bacon and dried beef. Many of these warriors are armed with spits, platters and frying pans. In Dona Quaresma's army are leeks, salted sardines, cured eels, and many other fish. Here she wins initially, though at the end of the episode Don Carnal returns triumphantly, with Don Amor, and Quaresma takes to flight. It would take far too long to summarize all the literary battles of this kind which Rabelais could have known, but two recently edited French The edition referred to is the one edited by Julio Cejador y Franca (Madrid, 1913), 2 vols. The battle episode begins at verse 1067. Kemlin M. Laurence, "The Battle between Don Carnal and Doha Quaresma in the light of medieval tradition." In Libro de Buen Amor Studies, ed. G.B.

In note 38 (p. 175) Laurence discusses the fresuelos/quesuelos controversy. 14 Spring 1981</page><page sequence="4">Β OWEN Renaissance carnival plays, perhaps the only surviving examples of a once flourishing genre, seem especially pertinent.10 The first, La Bataille de Sainct Pensard à l'encontre de Caresme, was probably performed both at Tours in 1485 (Aubailly, op. cit., p. ix) and at Issoudun in about 1533.11 Since this play has not been previously discussed as a possible source of the Andouilles episode, I should like to examine it briefly. Charnau's supporters, like Frère Jean's, are cooks, "tous successeurs de Taillevant" (86), one of whom is called Tirelardon (84). He boasts that among his equipment "ay hocqueton tout neuf Trestout esmaillé de saulcisses" (142-3). Charnau's captains (Chose and Commentenon12) order their troops to arm themselves with "Langues de beuf et tel salleures/ En [et?] endoulles a plain carcatz" (227-8). Andouilles are mentioned twice more, first as a fearsome weapon. Marquet, one of Caresme's lieutenants, says: Je n'ay poil au cul qui ne boulle Ne entraille qui n'esternue Quant je pense aux grans coups d'andouille Qu'on faict sur une teste nue! (549-52) Later "une grande cyviere Plaine d'andouilles et de trippes" is brought as refreshment to Charnau and his army (689 - 90). Caresme's troops, notable mainly for their cowardice, are armed with herrings and other fish, turnips, mussels, chestnuts and cabbages. Lasdejeuner, one of the sergens, describes his armour: J'ay la belle trousse de flesches Empanées des harens soretz Et pour bouclier j'ay une lesche D'anguilles peschées es maretz. (421-4) This play is unusual in several respects. Its cast of characters includes Le dieu Bacus and his supporters Architriclin, Noé and Lot, who are referred to as "anges"; Caresme's troops are cowards who evoke no sympathy; Jean-Claude Aubailly, éd., Deux Jeux de Carnaval de la fin du Moyen Age: La Bataille de Sainct Pensard à Τencontre de Caresme et le Testament de Carmentrant (Geneva: Droz, 1978). Judging by the quotation from Dontenville in A. Krailsheimer, "The Andouilles of the Quart Livre," in François Rabelais: Ouvrage publié pour le 4e centenaire de sa mort, 1553—1953 (Geneva: Droz, 1953), p. 227 and n.l. Common euphemisms for the female sexual organs. This is one of the very few refer ences which appear to associate sexual license with Carnival. Vol. XXI, No. 1 15</page><page sequence="5">L'Esprit Créateur the main interest is clearly not in the battle which is over in 20 lines with the retreat of Caresme, who is subsequently banished for a year. But the action is lively, the characters amusing, and it must have been a delight to see performed. The second play, Le Testament de Carmentrant (c. 1540?) is disap pointing. "Composé par Abundance a grant haste" says the manuscript (Aubailly, p.87), but not even haste can excuse it, in my view. It is only 307 lines long, its octosyllables are limping, the battle involves a good deal of shouting but no details of action or weapons, and the long last speech is the defeated Carmentrant's rather feeble "adieu" to the pleasures he must leave behind. The only detail which might have inter ested Rabelais is that Carmentrant (who is of course here Carnival, not Lent) has a lieutenant called Talhebudin. The only other contemporary French description of this battle is a lively poem in decasyllables published by Montaiglon,13 La Description du merveilleux conflict et très cruelle bataille faicte entre les deux plus grands Princes de la Région Bufatique, appeliez Caresme et Charnaige. Caresme, who starts the quarrel, has hosts of fish (including Congres) who fight against Charnaige's pigs. Caresme besieges Charnaige in a castle called Pitance, from which the besieged fire eggs at the fish. When the fish are defeated, Caresme tries to get help from the whale, who refuses, and then acquires troops of vegetables—mushrooms, spinach, radishes, carrots, turnips and leeks. Charnaige, however, summons poultry reinforcements who win the battle for him. It is clear, I think, even from these few examples, that Rabelais' Andouilles belong to a venerable tradition. Carnival/Lent literature was even more popular in Italy,14 where Rabelais might well have seen a play or read a poem. The Deux Princes just quoted is related to an Ital ian poem, II Contrasto del Carnevale colla Quaresima,15 in which the forces of Carnovale include all sorts of cooked meat, not forgetting migliacci (blood-pudding). Quaresima rides on an eel, and her supporters are numbered in millions: "et trote, ragni, lamprede et anguille/fur delle [nelie?] navi mille volte mille" (I, xxxiii). In all the examples quoted the depictions of Carnival and Lent are variation on very simple stereotypes. It is true that in the fabliau, Sainct Recueil de Poésies françoises des XVe et XVle siècles (Paris: Jannet, 1855-75), X, 110-127. Cf. Luigi Manzoni, éd., Libro di Carnevale dei secoli XV e XVI (Bologna, 1881). Edited by Manzoni (see note 14). This poem, and two others in the same collection, the Frottolu di Carnevale and the Rappresentazione et festa di Carnasciale &amp; della Quaresima, are quite elaborate and full of delightful details and ingenious action. 16 Spring 1981</page><page sequence="6">Β OWEN Pensard and Deux Princes, both are male, whereas in the Libro de Buen Amor, the Testament de Carmentrant and the Contrasto Lent is female. Interestingly, in Brueghel's painting it is not clear whether Lent is male or female, and the critics disagree. The outcome of the battle also varies. In the fabliau, Sainct Pensard, the Contrasto and Deux Princes Carnival wins, in the Testament de Carmentrant he loses, while in the Libro de Buen Amor he is at first defeated but later triumphs. And again, I find Brueghel interesting, since there is no indication in his painting of who is going to win, nor indeed that the battle will be very energetic.16 From the Catholic point of view there is nothing surprising in these ambiguities, and I cannot go along with Manzoni and other critics who see some of these works as insidious protests against the Catholic establishment.17 II. Andouilles and anguilles. Perhaps we seem to have wandered rather far from Rabelais, in whose episode there are no fish, eggs, leeks or garlic. But there are sausages, which we have met frequently associated with Carnival, and which seem indeed to be traditional symbols of over eating. The Proscenium of Johann Theodor de Bry'8 contains a marvelous gluttony scene imitated from Brueghel, with fat men, women and children gorging themselves on meat and wine. The table is littered with pigs' heads and sausages, and sausages and huge joints of meat hang from the ceiling. Andouilles are specifically mentioned several times among Carnival's retinue and/or armor in the fabliau and Sainct Pensard, and in both are associated with saucisses. Moreover, not just in these two works but in all those quoted except one {Le Testament de Carmentrant) eels are mentioned as attributes of Lent, whether they fight in her army or are used as weapons, armour, or food. Now it so happens that the French words andouille and anguille are quite similar in sound, though very different in origin.19 Is there any reason to suppose that when Rabelais writes andouilles he is also thinking of anguilles? At first sight, there appears no basis for such a supposition. The word occurs in the episode only once, in the cook's name Froiddanguille (ch. 40), and if the Andouilles represent Carnival, in perpetual conflict with the monster Quaresme 16. Critics have pointed out that the battle owes something to the medieval debate tradi tion, in which aggression necessarily remains verbal. 17. The tone of these works is completely different, I believe, from that of genuine reli gious polemic using food as a theme, like the Satyres Chrestiennes de la Cuisine Papale, or the Polymachie des Marmitons in Montaiglon's collection (VII, 51-65). 18.

Vol. XXI, No.l 17</page><page sequence="7">L'Esprit Créateur prenant, then one would not expect to find eels connected with them. In the Carnival/Lent works just quoted andouilles are separated from, and hostile to, anguilles, but there is intriguing juxtaposition of the two in the Disciple de Pantagruel,20 which we know to be an important source of the Quart Livre in general and of the Andouilles episode in particular (Krailsheimer, art. cit., η. 12). In chapters 10-11 of this mock epic we meet the Farouches, who live under the sea for fear of getting wet, and who have long teeth like alesnes, which Cotgrave translates as "a spotted, and long snowted Ray, or Thornebacke, tearmed by some, the sharpe-snowted Ray." The Farouches may be "gens veluz comme ratz," but they behave more like fish. They also catch fish, "desquelz ilz vivent et mengent à la moustarde, comme nous faisons les andouilles. . Then follows the episode of the Andouilles (chs. 12-13), which when killed are salted and dried by Panurge and his companions—a treatment more common in the case of eels than of sausages. Later in the voyage the travellers come to an island much like the traditional Pays de Cocagne (ch. 18), where they find mountains of butter and flour respec tively, and a river of poys au lard in which grow ("croissent") giant andouilles salées toutes fraisches. There are also trees whose fruit are pods containing male boudins and (oddly) female saulcisses, and a river of milk in which swim anguilles, lamprois and gongres. Panurge uses a saulcisse as bait to capture an anguille. So here we have the two associated so closely that they are almost interchangeable. There are close connections between andouilles and anguilles in other contexts. For Rabelais, mustard is the "baume naturel et restaurant d'andouilles" (ch. 42). Mustard accompanies sausages also in the passage just quoted from the Disciple, and in the fabliau. But in Sainct Pensard Caresme's weapons include "Harens bien picquans a moustarde" (331), and the Farouches eat their fish with mustard, so that it is clearly used both on Shrove Tuesday with sausages, and in Lent, with fish. The well-known emblem book called Proteus, by Jacob Cats,21 has an interesting picture of two people in a market handling vives, a kind of sting-fish which must be touched with great caution. In the picture (p. 128) the fish look very much like eels. The whole French poem reads as follows: 20. Ed. Paul Lacroix (Paris: Librairie des Bibliophiles, 1875). 21. Proteus (Rotterdam, 1627), No. XXII: Laedit ineptos. 18 Spring 1981</page><page sequence="8">Bowen Cil qui la vive prend, &amp; ou qu'il faut, la touche; Appreste, quant il veut, viande pour sa bouche; La mal addroicte main produira l'enrager, Dy, n'est ce pas l'amour dont tu me veus parler? And this brings us to another very obvious connection between eels and sausages. Rabelais' andouilles are both clearly female and clearly phallic (their queen is called Niphleseth, which means "penis" in Hebrew22). In the sources I have discussed sausages are apparently not phallic, although they might well have been, since in the Middle Ages Lent was a time of abstinence from sexual intercourse as well as from many kinds of food. Nor have illustrators of Rabelais necessarily seen the andouilles this way. Bastien's version of the battle, for instance, in the An VI edition of Rabelais (reproduced in Demerson's edition, p. 679), portrays it as straightforward narrative—though the sausages look remarkably like eels. However, we do know that in the 16th century a sausage could have precisely the connotation a nasty modern mind would expect. According to the Trésor de la Langue Française, this connotation has existed at least since 1178. Saint Boudin23 and Saint Andouille24 are already old jokes by Rabelais' time, Montaiglon's collection contains a charming Sermon de l'endouille (op. cit., IV, 87—93), and such refer ences are frequent in the farces and in Béroalde de Verville, for instance. Oddly, unlike eels, sausages are hard to find in Renaissance art, but I have found an interesting example, in a 1514 copy by Urs Graf25 of a Baldung Grien engraving depicting a Witches' Sabbath (there are several other versions of this). The witches, naked and in strange postures, are surrounded by various enigmatic objects associated with uieir rues, including rnree sausages nanging on a stick, l nese sausages are almost certainly phallic; witches are reputed to make men impotent by simply removing their penises.26 Nor is there any doubt about the connection between eels and sex, although it need not be the straightforward eel-penis equivalent familiar to us since Freud. Reusner's emblem book of 159127 illustrates Nescit Rabelais may have known that the word meant a phallic cult-object of some kind; cf. M.A. Screech, Rabelais, p. 376, n. 15. E.g. in the Farce du Pardonneur. Ancien Théâtre François, II, 58. Cf. Sainéan, La Langue de Rabelais (Paris: Boccard, 1922-3), II, 360.

AA1, IN Ο. 1 19</page><page sequence="9">L'Esprit Créateur vox missa reverti with a curious heraldic device of a hand clutching an eel, which is wound round the hand and lower arm. The text specifically equates the eel with lubrica verba'. "Lubrica verba caue, digito compesce labellum:/Pressa anguilla manu lubrica rite manet." Another example from Cats' emblem book (op. cit., p. 2, No. I: Quod perdidit, optat) shows a fashionably dressed courting couple standing at a market table, on which a hand, emerging from a cloud and holding a large knife, has just cut an eel in half. The French verse says: Veus tu sçavoir, Amy, pourquoy la douce rage Nous pousse par amour au port de mariage? Escoute la raison, l'amant qui est blessé Se veut unir au corps, dont il est desmembré. This is an amusing variant on the androgyne topos, and further proof that we are not just applying a modern prejudice when we assume that eels, like sausages, can have sexual associations. Rabelais juxtaposes them in this context in ch. 38, where he claims that "Le serpens qui tenta Eve estoit andouillicque" (anguila, "eel," derives from anguis, "snake"), and that "Encores maintient on en certaines Academies que ce tentateur estoit l'andouille nommée Ithyphalle, en laquelle feut jadis transformé le bon messer Priapus"—i.e., that the cause of the Fall was the discovery of sex. Cornelius Agrippa, among others, had maintained this, and this may be one reason why two of the decorative medallions surrounding Cats' emblem show the Creation, and Adam and Eve in the garden. To return for a moment to the emblem by Keusner mentioned above, his illustration of a very old proverb, "a word once uttered cannot be recalled," raises the whole question of proverbial eels and sausages. Critics have pointed out that Rabelais' episode is based on words and phrases: the names Riffl'Andouille and Tailleboudin, the adage "pourceau Minerve enseignant," the name of the Rue pavée d'Andouilles, and the idiom "rompre les andouilles au genou." This expression, meaning "to undertake something impossible," is put literally into action by Pantagruel during the battle, and critics have assumed that, as was the case with the captains' names, Rabelais was playing with a well-known proverb. But the only example of rompre les andouilles au genou before Rabelais, as far as I know, is in Noël du Fail's preface to the Baliverneries d'Eutrapel (1549).28 Indeed the proverb, judging by 28. Ed. Louis-Raymond Lefèvre (Paris: Garnier, 1928), p. 107: "Il ne fault pas cuider du 20 Spring 1981</page><page sequence="10">Β OWEN the reference books, is not nearly as common as rompre les anguilles au genou. The only 16th-century examples of the former I have found are from Du Fail, Rabelais and the Satyres Chrestiennes de la Cuisine Papale,29 while the latter, in singular or plural form, was used by Gringoire in 1509,30 in Les Ditz de Chascun which Montaiglon dates around 1530 (Anciennes Poésies Françoises, Χ, 158), four times by Calvin (see Huguet's dictionary, art. anguille), and by La Planche and Cholières at the end of the century. Cotgrave gives only "Rompre l'anguille au genouil: To perform an impossibilitie." The assumption that "rompre l'andouille" was the standard form can presumably be attributed to the early compilers of reference works, who knew Rabelais and did not know other 16th-century authors. Thus Furetière's Dictionnaire Universel (1690) gives "rompre l'anguille au genou," and concludes its explanation: "On disoit autrefois, Rompre l'andouille au genou, dans le même sens." This is repeated both by the Dictionnaire des Proverbes François in 1710 and the Dictionnaire de Trévoux in 1771. The number of surviving examples, and their dates, suggest the opposite: that "rompre l'anguille" was the original form, and that Du Fail and Rabelais created "rompre l'andouille" from it. This seems all the more likely in that throughout the Middle Ages eel proverbs are common, and sausage proverbs very rare. Thus for instance Morawski's Proverbes français antérieurs au XVe siècle31 provides no proverb connected with andouilles or on saucisses, but four on anguilles. And this in turn would explain why there are so many eels and so few sausages in 16th-century emblems. The Reusner emblem derives from an Alciati emblem in the 1531 edition32 of a man catching an eel in a fig leaf to counteract its slipperiness—another way of grasping Occasio by the forelock. Such emblems are common. In 1539 La Perrière claims that "Si tost se perd (en amours) foy de femme,/Comme l'anguille eschappe de la main,"33 and Boissard in 1596 warns that life slips from beau premier coup vouloir changer ceste nature, et rompre les andouilles avec les genoux." 1560; often attributed to Pierre Viret.

In fact, I am claiming that Rabelais in this whole episode is deliberately conflating andouilles with anguilles. While in the context of the tradi tional battle they remain firmly separated, sausages in Carnival's camp and eels in Lent's, in the other contexts I have mentioned overlap and confusion are possible. In the Disciple de Pantagruel eels and sausages are almost interchangeable; mustard, used as a high point in Rabelais' action, is associated with both; they have the same obvious sexual connotations; the original form of Rabelais' proverb probably used eels, not sausages, and in any case by the date of the Quart Livre both forms were in use. III. Carnival confused with Lent. But what might be the point of conflating or confusing a symbol of Lent and a symbol of Carnival? To the Middle Ages Carnival and Lent were both necessary, inevitable episodes in the eternal cycle of the Church year. To us, especially since Bakhtine, they are more likely to be genuine enemies. Carnival is the free spirit of popular culture, courageously rebelling against the sinister, destructive Establishment forces represented by Lent. But it may well be that in 1552 neither of these attitudes is entirely applicable. Some Reformers included Lenten observance in the Papist practices they condemned, and already religion had become enmeshed in politics. In an atmosphere of constant disagreement, not just between Catholics and Reformers, but among many different Reformers' points of view, it is not surprising if traditional entities are no longer clear-cut. Indeed, there was probably always some ambivalence in the relationship between Carnival and Lent. In their literary battles sometimes one wins, and sometimes the other; Carnaval may be a jolly good fellow and Carême a weak coward, or Carnaval a reprehensible glutton and Carême a force of necessary purification. This ambivalence is strong, I believe, in Nicolas de la Chesnaye's Condamnation de Bancquet (1507?). The 19th century illustrator,35 as usual following Brueghel, sees Bancquet as a plump, jolly fellow with a chicken on a spit and a glass of wine, wearing a carrot in his hat, a necklace of sausages, a string of onions and a bunch 34.

But if this illustrator had read the play he would have visualised him more properly as a "felon," who betrays his guests to a crowd of illnesses lying in ambush, and is executed on stage at the end. In Brueghel's painting, it seems to me, both Carnival and Lent are thoroughly unattractive characters, and the supporters of each are behaving reprehensibly, in their very different ways. Rabelais begins his confrontation between them by describing Quaresmeprenant (chs. 29-32). We do not doubt that he means Lent, although as we have seen the term can also mean Carnival, and Cotgrave gives "Shroue-tuesday" for both Careme entrant and Careme prenant. Rabelais' Quaresmeprenant reminds Pantagruel of "Amodunt et Dis cordance" (ch. 32), which is clear enough. We therefore expect the Andouilles to have the attributes of Carnival, and to some extent they do. Their allies are other varieties of sausage, their god is a pig, and they are "de pourceau extraictes." But they also remind us rather strongly of anguilles. And whose side is Pantagruel on? The battle begins because they mistake him for Quaresmeprenant (on account of his size, presum ably), so they must think they are fighting for Carnival against Lent. But Pantagruel's shock troops consist of Frère Jean and his cooks, many of whom have names ending in lardon, and who hide in a Grande Truie. Gymnaste, moreover, shouts to the Andouilles that the companions are allies of Mardigras "vostre antique confoederé." We seem to have strayed into a battle where the opposing sides are blurred; where it is no longer clear which is Carnival, and which Lent. Krailsheimer has suggested an attractive specific reason for this apparent confusion. Whether or not all of his identifications are corect, his discussion of the political situation during the year of the League of Schmalkalden is illuminating. He proposes that Quaresmeprenant is Charles V, who "was in fact so violently condemned by the Pope (and later the Council [of Trent]), for his negotiations with his German Protes tant subjects that, mirabile dictu, both Calvin and Luther wrote in his defence" (op. cit., p. 229). Surely, from the doctrinal viewpoint of the stable Middle Ages, no more horrible confusion could be imagined than this—an apparent alliance between the Holy Roman Emperor, who should be the defender of the faith, with criminal heretics against the Pope, who is his spiritual father. We know that satirical monsters were common in religious polemic long before the Quart Livre, and that the leaders of all factions were attacked by means of grotesque caricature. In Cochlaeus' Septiceps Lutherus of 1529 we see a Luther with seven different heads repre Vol. XXI, No. 1 23</page><page sequence="13">L'Esprit Créateur senting contradictory aspects of him being satirised.36 Closer in time to Rabelais caricature by means of food, as in the case of our sausages, is the basis of Arcimboldo's celebrated portrait of Calvin (1566), whose eye is a dead bird's eye, his mouth a fish's mouth, and the whole face built up of depressing dead fish and fowl. If Calvin can look like this, Charles V might well look like Quaresmeprenant. Reformers attack the Church with equal enthusiasm and ingenuity. The best-known such attack is the Pope-Ass of Rome,37 with his ass's head satirising the Pope, his bare breasts signifying the immorality of Catholics, and all the other significant details. But one monster, I think, is closer to Quaresmeprenant than any other I have seen. The engraving (of 1525) shows the Pope being carried through the air towards a horri fying anthropomorphic figure of Hell provided with a webbed foot, one breast, one wing, a deformed body with scales on it, and an enormous mouth inside which ecclesiastical characters are sitting around a tavern table, while animals and fish are being roasted on the top of his head. He is seated on a Papal Bull to make the point quite clear, and he is hardly less grotesque than the monstrous enemy of the Andouilles.38 If Rabelais' Quaresmeprenant is Charles V, then the subsequent conflation of andouilles and anguilles is a comment on the current situation.39 Rabelais is certainly drawing on his own and his readers' recollections of the traditional Carnival/Lent confrontation, but he may also be alluding to the insoluble dilemmas created by doctrinal disagree ment. In his ideal fictional world Pantagruel is able to stop the battle (although only with the divine intervention of the pig), but in the real world Calvin and Luther side with Charles V against the Pope, and Carnival and Lent are no longer separate entities. Other episodes in the Quart Livre comment on the contemporary religious climate: certainly the storm and the Papimanes, probably the Papefigues, and possibly several others. We know that on some doctrinal issues Rabelais' sympathies would have been with the Reformers (though In Paul Drews, Der Evangelische Geistliche in der Deutschen Vergangenheit (Iena, 1924), p. 25. There is a seven-headed Calvin in the same volume (p. 55), which contains a remarkable collection of such monsters.

This interpretation does not conflict with Screech's view of the Andouilles as "fierce, treacherous Christian sausages excluded from Trent."

I suggest that the Andouilles episode, by evoking a group of contexts in which eels become confused with sausages, is a comment upon the doctrinal confusion which accompanies religious discord. One result of the Reformation, even if not one of the most tragic, was that Carnival and Lent would never be the same again. University of Illinois (Urbana) Vol. XXI, No. 1 25</page></plain_text>
