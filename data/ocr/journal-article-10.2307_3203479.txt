<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lisa Penialoza The Commodification of the American West: Marketers' Production of Cultural Meanings at the Trade Show The author employs critical ethnographic methods to examine empirically marketers' processes of producing cul- tural meanings at a western stock show and rodeo. Western cultural meanings and values of freedom, naturalism, competition, and family values are produced by marketers in attracting a nonranch audience; juxtaposing business, education, and entertainment; making ample references to historical tradition; and using business activity as the basis for claims of authenticity. Marketing implications center on tapping into rich sources of cultural meaning by (1) attending to the cultural dimensions of economic activity, (2) taking industry as the unit of analysis through an exam- ination of representations of production in market discourses and practices, (3) expanding history from a research method to a source of market meaning, and (4) considering the marketplace as a lived tradition. he U.S. West conjures up romantic images of mythic proportions in the United States and abroad-a lone- some cowboy tending cattle on the open range, thun- dering herds of buffalo and wild horses, and antagonistic Indian tribes.1 Historically and at present, marketers have successfully forged links between images and narratives of the Wild West and products and services. An early example is Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, which toured the United States and Europe at the turn of the century (White 1994) and is now reenacted daily at EuroDisney. Other current examples include the globally popular Marlboro cigarettes, Wrangler jeans, and Jeep Cherokees.2 Yet strangely enough, the rich imagery of the cattle industry is absent in contem- porary U.S. beef promotions. Instead, the long-standing campaign "Beef-it's what's for dinner" emphasizes the convenience and regularity of beef meals. The reasons for this omission have as much to do with the particular ways the cattle market has modernized as with the ways cultural meanings and values are produced within it. In this research I investigate marketers' processes of producing cultural meanings at the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo. At its most basic, the National Western is a trade show. Trade shows increasingly are used to market new products and technology efficiently, both domestically and abroad. After advertising, trade shows are the largest item in the marketing communications budget, with esti- mated annual expenditures of more than $53 billion in the United States (Gopalakrishna et al. 1995). Among the best known are the Comdex Computer Exposition in Las Vegas and the Salon Internationale de l'Alimentation International Food Products Exhibition in Paris (Hunt 1998). As I demonstrate, the trade show is much more than a place to promote products and services to distributors. Sim- ilar to many trade shows, the National Western represents a rich historical legacy for the industry and a bountiful reser- voir of cultural meanings. Stock shows originated in Europe in the mid-fifteenth century (Ritvo 1987), and to this day most of the cattle produced in the United States have Euro- pean origins. Contemporary shows emphasize superior breeding stock, animal husbandry practices, and feats of ani- mal handling. Because of differences in cultural traditions, climate, and terrain, the shows vary widely in the types of animals and ways of showing them. In the United Kingdom, stockmen don the topcoats and bowlers of country squires. In the United States, stockmen in cowboy attire show dairy and beef cattle raised on smaller, more fertile farms in the East and Midwest, whereas beef cattle are predominant on the larger ranches in the arid plains of the Southwest. This show may be seen as the culmination of two paths of cultural and economic expansion for the cattle industry in the United States-westward from Europe (Skaggs 1986) and northward from Mexico (Lawrence 1982). The National Western began in 1899, organized by a collective of live- IMost Native American Indian tribes were pacifist (Churchill 1993; Limerick 1987). 2See Churchill's (1993) critical analysis of merchandising Native American tribal names.

Despite a focus on industry trade and development, all shows have depended financially on public admissions fees and as a result have provided enter- tainment and education from their inception (Simms 1981; Skaggs 1986). Today, beef cattle trade continues as the show's raison d'&amp;tre, and the show appeals to visitors with a rodeo, trained animal performances, hundreds of merchan- dise booths, and a series of competitions for purebred cattle and other animals. In 1996, stock sales totaled just under $7 million of an estimated $55 million in total business gener- ated by approximately 600,000 people over a two-week period in January (Sinisi 1997; Smith 1997). I begin the article with a theoretical foundation con- structed from work in marketing, cultural studies, and west- ern history. The research design brings together historical data on the show's 100-year tradition with contemporary ethnographic observations and interviews. Research ques- tions include (1) the cultural dimension of market exchanges here, (2) substantive western cultural meanings and values, (3) the roles of marketers in the production of western cul- tural meanings and values, and (4) the effect of these market meanings on marketers. The ethnographic account then pro- vides a brief historical overview of the show, followed by descriptive and interpretive analysis of contemporary agents and activities. Data presentation entails descriptions of agents and show events intertwined with observation of activities and interview excerpts. The account progresses from description to interpretation to familiarize readers with the various elements of the show before explicating the ana- lytical and theoretical contributions. Overall, the show is a celebration of the West as a par- ticular subculture, composed of business activities, linguis- tic forms, values, aesthetics, and a way of life that cuts to the heart of this nation. Manifest here is a subset of western cul- ture produced by marketers through particular processes of commodification. I use this term not in the neoclassical eco- nomic sense of the absence of meaning and distinction among products and services in a competitive marketplace, but rather in the semiotic sense of marketers' and con- sumers' tendencies to imbue and attribute meanings and sta- tus to market offerings and practices (Baudrillard 1988; Bourdieu 1984; Mick 1986). The term "commodification" thus describes the ways cultural meanings and values are produced through marketing activities.3 Much attention has been directed to the ways advertisements endow products with cultural meanings through consumers' readings of them (Scott 1994). Yet marketers at the trade show are no less effective in accomplishing cultural feats by providing a space where producers conduct business and, in doing so, entertain and educate consumers. Substantive cultural themes negotiated at the show form the nucleus of western market culture. Evident in interview responses and in activities performed here is a complex and contradictory amalgam of cultural meanings and values of freedom, naturalism, competition, and family values. These cultural meanings and values are articulated through a festi- val-like celebration of stock trading, animal husbandry activities, trained animal performances, and merchandising (see Figure 1). Processes through which marketers produce western culture include (1) attracting a nonranch audience; (2) mixing business, education, and entertainment; (3) invoking the show's historical tradition; and (4) using busi- ness practices as the basis for claims of authenticity. In the Implications and Conclusions section, I discuss how marketers can benefit from tapping into rich reservoirs of cultural meanings by (1) exploring more fully the cultural dimensions of marketing activity; (2) taking industry as the unit of analysis, with attention to representations of produc- tion in market discourses and activities; (3) expanding history from a research method to a source of market meaning; and (4) considering the lived effects of market activity on mar- keters. First, although much attention is given to economic aspects of markets, much practical and theoretical knowledge may be gained by examining their cultural functions. Second, although much of the focus in marketing is on firm behavior, industry, too, merits attention. It is at this level that con- sumers experience and negotiate cultural meanings for many products and services. Third, the historical legacy of the show in its ties to the Old West provides marketers with a rich store of cultural meanings that resonate deeply with consumers as the result of the important role of cattle production in the nation. Fourth, the contradictory ways marketers view their industry are a rich source of cultural meanings. Coexisting with ranchers' claims of freedom and the noble work of sup- plying food are expressions of humans' dominion over nature and recognition of their interdependence with and responsi- bilities for the animals as custodians. At the same time cattle production symbolizes these fundamental American values, ranchers express feelings of betrayal as much by an industry they find increasingly difficult to compete in successfully as by consumers in their health and environmental concerns. Theoretical Foundations The Cultural Role of the Trade Show In marketing, the majority of ethnographic studies of culture focus on consumers and consumption. In much of this work, authors direct attention to the culturally productive work of consumers by conceptualizing marketers as cultural mediators whose work lies between consumers and the culturally consti- tuted world. This latter view originally was put forward by McCracken (1986) and continues to be the dominant cultural model of the marketplace. Studies in this tradition have been done across a wide array of phenomena, including fashion (Thompson and Haytko 1997), advertising (Ritson and Elliott 1999), services (Arnould and Price 1993), holidays (Wallen- dorf and Arnould 1991), dating (Applbaum and Jordt 1996), social class (Holt 1997), and acculturation (Pefialoza 1994). However, an emerging body of ethnographic work approaches marketing activity as a cultural phenomenon (Sherry 1995). One of the earliest examples is a study of peasant marketing in Java (Dewey 1962). Other ethnogra- phers have examined sales (Prus 1989), new product devel- opment (Workman 1993), distribution (Arnould 1995), ser- 3Data collected in this work deal with individual businesses, pri- marily those of ranchers and boothsellers, as well as the industry overall. In another article, I focus primarily on consumers (Pefialoza 2000).

These studies advance the conceptualizations of culture beyond its influ- ences on marketing practices to recognize it as a founda- tional aspect of marketplace behavior. A subset of this work focuses explicitly on the culturally productive activities of marketers in relation to consumers. Creighton's (1982) work on Japanese department stores, Arnould and Price's (1993) and Price, Arnould, and Tier- ney's (1995) work on river rafting, Lien's (1997) work on foods marketing in Norway, and Miller's (1997) work on advertising agencies in Trinidad detail how marketers pack cultural characteristics into advertisements, products, and stores, respectively, in targeting domestic and international consumers. Implicit in this work is a model of culture more consistent with that developed by Pefialoza and Gilly (1999). These authors reposition the marketplace and mar- ket stimuli as cultural mediations located between marketers and consumers and produced in and through their joint activities (see Figure 2). The trade show, too, is a marketplace characterized by marketers' and consumers' joint cultural production. Because of both the characteristics of this trade show and the ethnographic research approach, I am able to direct attention to marketers' roles not only in conveying culture but also in producing the cultural world. Agricultural pro- ducers are marketers in the sense that buying and selling cat- 84 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="4">tie is fundamental to their work.4 Furthermore, in exploring the marketing trade show as a cultural activity, this research adds to previous studies that evaluate its use in introducing products and services and gaining distribution (Cavanaugh 1976; Gopalakrishna et al. 1995). As a cultural phenomenon, trade shows may be traced to harvest festivals, world fairs, and exhibitions. Harvest festi- vals are a type of market performance (Deighton 1992) that celebrate abundance and give recognition to producers (Lavenda 1992). Examples include the many state and local fairs (Prosterman 1995), as well as specific crop festivals, such as the Garlic Festival in Gilroy, Calif., and the Straw- berry Festival in Pasadena, Tex. In contrast, the world fairs and expositions emerged in Europe and in the United States at the turn of the century in showcasing the growing promi- nence of the nation-state and large corporations (Harris 1990). Benedict (1983) emphasizes the ideological impor- tance of these events in providing cultural icons that articu- lated collective hopes and fears regarding impending changes of industrialism and urbanism to millions of people from all over the world. Sussman (1983, p. 4) describes the expositions as rites of passage that "made possible the acceptance of a new way of life, values and new forms of social organization." Rydell (1993) emphasizes how the shows lent significant legitimacy to industrial producers by linking the abundance of modern production techniques to the biblical promised land. In comparison with harvest festivals, which celebrate local production, and the world fairs, which showcase the nation and its major corporations, the trade show promotes a particular industry. The beef industry commands a long- standing historical legacy in the United States that is intri- cately woven into the nation's culture. Its formative influ- ence is evident in the general use of the agricultural terms "branding" and "stock market." The history of the industry is woven intricately into the marketing discipline as well, as our earliest studies are of agricultural distribution (Bartels 1965). This focus on industry culture adds an important dimension to the literature, as studies of organizational cul- ture are much more common (Deshpand6, Farley, and Web- ster 1993). Of interest is whether the stock show conveys cultural meanings and, if so, the nature of the processes through which these meanings are accomplished. For if it does, the trade show would then join other market venues as a powerful social theater that literally endows reality with cultural meaning through ritual displays of products and other marketing activities and exchanges. Another set of questions relates to the ideological effects of the cultural meanings produced at the show, that is, the relations between these cultural meanings and show participants' more general conceptions of the nature of reality. Just as the world fairs and expositions legitimated their sponsoring nations and corporations, the stock show may accomplish parallel ideological effects in legitimizing the beef industry as its main sponsor and putting forth notions of appropriate cultural life. If so, this research offers important implica- tions regarding the work of marketers in not only dissemi- nating ideas about western culture but also contributing to its very production. Western Culture The western United States has a long-standing culture of vital importance to the national imaginary (Anderson 1983; White and Limerick 1994).5 Central are the heroic accounts of white male explorers, trappers, miners, and cowboys. More recently, revisionist historians have brought forward the experiences of Native American, Latino/a, Black, and Asian American pioneers and settlers, with attention to their important roles as businesspeople, particularly those involved in the early beef industry (Churchill 1993; Limer- ick 1987; Skaggs 1986). Cattle production has taken a dis- tinct character in the West as the result of geographic cli- mate, terrain, and location, emphasizing a largely rural culture that has evolved in contrast with urban forms. This research interjects region as a pertinent base for market cul- ture, contributing to previous studies at the level of the nation-state and ethnic subgroup (Pefialoza 1994; Tse et al. 1988). Western culture, like these other forms, is composed of a common history, identity, beliefs and values, language, customs, and physical characteristics that are recognized in relation to other cultural groups (Askegaard 1991). The frontier is a key construct marking the western region, its people, and their respective values and ways of life from the rest of the nation. By 1893, the historian Fred- erick Jackson Turner had listed the frontier experience as the single most formative influence on American character. Symbolic as well as material in nature, the frontier has recorded the nation's ongoing negotiation with modernity in its westward shifts over time that have occurred with increases in the concentration of people and economic activ- ity. White and Limerick (1994) note that though there was and continues to be disagreement regarding the physical location and significance of the frontier, it continues to mark the limits of civilization as a choice between two ways of life-one more natural than the other. Historically, farmers from the Northeast moved west and south in search of land-and the meat markets followed in their stead-from the northeastern markets of New York and Massachusetts in the mid-1600s, west to the Ohio Valley and south to the Appalachian Valley in the late 1700s, and west to Chicago in the early 1800s (Skaggs 1986). By the late 1880s, pack- ers began to move away from union strongholds in Chicago to Kansas City and Denver, the site of the present show, to take advantage of cheap grass, cost savings from shipping dressed beef by rail, less regulation, and a nonunion work- force (Simms 1981; Skaggs 1986). 4The relatively recent emphasis on marketing activities is not unique to the cattle industry but is a trend in many other produc- tion- and service-oriented firms as the result of globalization, strategic imperatives, communication technologies, and decentral- ized organizational structures. 5As a locus of meanings, the term "the West" is far from deter- minate. At its most general, the term signifies the geographical direction and corresponding area and cultures opposite of east, but it also represents the first-world nations in Europe and the United States and their particularly modem ways of life. In this work, the term signifies the area and corresponding ways of life in the phys- ical region of the United States west of the Mississippi River (Riebsame 1997). Commodification of the American West / 85</page><page sequence="5">It was at this time that the open range had come to an end. From the end of the Civil War until approximately 1890, cowboys drove large herds of cattle north and east to packers from feeding grounds in Texas and the western plains (Culley 1984). Despite the relatively short duration of the cattle drives and harsh working conditions, the cowboys live on in our imagination (Allmendinger 1992). To this day, mythic references to heroic acts of courage; boundless west- ern landscapes; and strong feelings of freedom, self- reliance, and honesty have immortalized the West in film, novels, and history. Western historians have worked to deci- pher these myths from reality, and all along, marketing activities have played a confounding role. In one of the most dramatic examples, Buffalo Bill Cody, U.S. cowboy hero extraordinaire, brought the Wild West to enthusiastic audi- ences in the eastern states and Europe in the early 1900s. His spectacular shows featured white settlers battling actual Native Americans and Mexicans and were underwritten by the Denver Post (White 1994).6 Cody capitalized on blurring fact and fiction, at times leaving the show to fight in battles he would later portray in his shows (Slotkin 1993). Scholars of market culture do well to veer from the his- torical project of separating fact from myth, though for dif- ferent reasons from those of the revisionist historians. Ele- vating fact to theory and relegating myth as an unfortunate contaminant limits marketing scholars' and practitioners' understandings of the ways the two routinely are combined in the marketplace. This line of argument is somewhat dis- tinct from that put forth by Stern (1992) regarding literary versus literal deception in advertising. Although the use of both fiction and myth in marketing blurs lines between real- ity and fantasy, myths are more than a literary device. Myths represent long-standing, relatively resilient, popular ritual traditions that perform important cultural functions in pro- viding answers to the big questions in life-its very origins, meanings, and purposes (Campbell 1974)-with implica- tions for the study of social power (Barthes 1972). Success- ful popular cultural products, such as music (Lipsitz 1994), theme parks (Davis 1997), and brands (Watson 1997), are particularly adept at incorporating the cultural contradic- tions of myths-hence, their relevance to marketing practi- tioners and academics. Regarding the myth of the cowboy, Allmendinger (1992) emphasizes its role in building a prolabor American culture. In ways not unlike carnival (Eco, Ivanov, and Rector 1984; Turner 1987), the liminal zone of the West elevates the worker-cowboy over the more powerful rancher-capitalist. The myth reverses and renders positive what would other- wise be a negative, banal existence, that is, estrangement from family and community ties, alienation from the pro- ceeds of his labor, lack of material goods, and absent sexu- ality. The freedom, individualism, and self-sufficiency of the cowboy is a stark existence revolving around work, the labor of producing animals for food, that is at odds with the consumer materialism that emerged at the turn of the cen- tury and is of central cultural significance today (Baudrillard 1988; Firat and Venkatesh 1995; Weber 1958). Stock shows, when viewed as a step in the centuries- long progression west and north for the cattle industry, should be regarded as the antithesis of the frontier and a her- ald of modernity. Yet, over time, and in contrast to the encroachment of modern life that characterizes so much of contemporary western United States, this show paradoxi- cally has come to represent the antithesis of the modern, as this marketplace has become a cultural receptacle for the Wild West of old. The last set of questions relates to the role of western myth at the show. Of interest are the contrasts between the western meanings and values articulated by ranchers, boothsellers, and visitors and their actual ways of life. In this sense, the stock show is viewed as a market site where competing experiences and views regarding the cattle business are played out, consistently with Sack's (1992) relational concept of place. In some ways, the romance of the West seems most relevant to the hundreds of thousands of visitors, for whom the show is as close to nature as many get. Yet these meanings likely provide ranchers with some basis for staying in the business as well, by helping define their activities and rewards.7 Thus, the show, like the persis- tent myth of the cowboy, may accomplish a valuable cul- tural function for participants in reversing-at least symbol- ically and for a short time-some of the less positive aspects of their contemporary existence. Critical Ethnographic Research Design The critical ethnographic research perspective directs atten- tion to the phenomenon of interest as embedded in a context of socioeconomic relations (Burawoy 1998; Marcus 1986). Similar to previous critical consumer studies (Holt 1998; Ozanne and Murray 1991; Thompson and Tambyah 1999), this critical marketing study draws from critical theoretical work in the humanities and social sciences in conceptualizing human agents as sentient beings negotiating their identities and life circumstances from particular positions and in rela- tion to others, while giving attention to the ways these sub- ject positions and social relations are structured economically and have developed over time. Issues brought to the fore in critical ethnographic marketing research include the cultural roles of market practices, discourses, agents, and institutions in constituting human subjectivity and social relationships. 6Buffalo Bill was one of the earliest western celebrities, having garnered fame from his activities in scouting and killing buffalo and Native Americans, though much doubt remains whether his feats were as great as he claimed (Slotkin 1993; White 1994). The Denver Post sponsorship was noted on a poster in the Buffalo Bill Museum, Golden, Colo. 7Today the West remains a heavily contested place. Once the economic mainstay of the area, ranchers now find it difficult to sur- vive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Relevant are escalating conflicts between the industries of the "new West" (i.e., manufacturing, recreation, tourism, and real estate) and those of the Old West (i.e., mining, agriculture, and timber) (Russell 1993). Since 1970, the number of small ranches and farms has decreased by 30%, as many foreclosures and sales of long-held family ranches to land developers have occurred. By 1993, small agricul- tural operations, those with $20,000 or less in earnings, accounted for two-thirds of the total number of operations yet accounted for only 4% of total agricultural sales. In contrast, large operations with $500,000 or more in earnings constituted 2% of total opera- tions yet tallied 40% of industry sales (McClain 1997). 86 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="6">The term "discourse" refers to the communicative means and substance of market exchange. In this research, I am interested in how notions of western culture are con- veyed, as well as their particular elements of meaning. Dis- cursive elements include verbal and nonverbal symbols, images, gestures, and roles that organize and convey social meanings regarding the social and material world and artic- ulate why people do what they do and how they relate to their surroundings (Potter and Wetherell 1987). The term "practices" refers to the behaviors in and through which market meanings and social relations are produced and enacted (Bourdieu 1984; De Certeau 1984). This attention to social practices retains an emphasis on behavioral study despite the linguistic turn in contemporary ethnography (Burawoy 1998; Geertz 1973). Significantly, market dis- courses and practices are not inaccessible to marketers or consumers; although they may be more or less conscious in their pervasiveness, they are an important part of market- place functioning. In this research, marketers are studied with the goal of understanding market behavior in ways parallel to those established for the study of consumers as an end in itself (Belk 1984; Holbrook 1995). In extending Thompson, Locander, and Polio's (1989) study of the lived effects of the market on consumers to marketers, this perspective fills an important gap in a maturing field. The study of marketers, market institutions, and market behavior as sociocultural ends in themselves and as a means of facilitating marketing objectives is vital to achieving greater balance in the knowl- edge and understanding of the contemporary marketplace. Relevant in this study of the cultural roles of the trade show are the social relations within and between market agents of various levels-beef producers, processors, distributors, and consumers-which include their sense of themselves in relation to other market agents, activities, and discourses. Although the focus of this work is the relationships and interactions of beef marketers and consumers at the National Western, consideration is given to retaining the findings in relation to the particular sociohistorical context of this 100- year-old trade show in the western United States In this research, I employ critically the research methods of participant observation, depth interviews, photographic records and material cultural artifact analysis over the six- year period 1992-97. Research objectives are (1) the nature of market exchanges at the show, (2) substantive cultural meanings and values of the West, (3) marketers' processes of making cultural meaning, and (4) the lived effects of the market on marketers. The show is held for two weeks every January.8 Although not quite as restrictive as a study of a single-day holiday (e.g., Wallendorf and Arnould's [1991] study of Thanksgiving), the present research is similar in its attempt to understand a long-standing historical tradition and was conducted over an extended period of time because of the short duration of the event. Participant observation activities totaled 210 hours and culminated in field notes and journal reflections. Covered were 21 cattle sales, 20 breed shows, scores of exhibit booths, 14 visits to the Children's Ranchland, 10 rodeos, and 20 other entertainment performances, including wagon driving com- petitions, horse and dog pulls, and riding contests. These activities were documented with attention to their purpose, relative prominence, and the characteristics and social rela- tionships of show participants. Eighty-nine depth interviews were conducted and fully transcribed. Informants included 30 ranchers, 30 exhibitors, and 29 visitors. Questions included participants' purposes in coming to the show, their activities, previous experience with the show and the cattle industry, meanings of the West, perspectives regarding events and activities at the show, and selected sociodemographic characteristics. On average, interviews lasted one hour. Over the six years of data collection, 550 photographs were taken at the show. These photographs of all the events helped maintain visible records of people and activities and supplement field notes. In addition to helping elaborate the various characteristics of show agents and activities, the photographs signaled areas for further research. Such issues as the type of booths, the range of activities, and the race/ethnicity and sex of attendees at particular events were investigated through further observation and interviews. Material artifacts included brochures, business cards and flyers, trade publications, newsletters, and newspapers. These items provided background on particular breeds, ranches, and issues that affect the industry as a whole. Pro- duced for industry insiders, the brochures, trade publica- tions, and newsletters provided information regarding improved animal production practices and responses to pub- lic health and environmental concerns. In contrast, newspa- per coverage was targeted primarily to those unfamiliar with the industry, explaining activities at the show and announc- ing the winners of particular competitions. Because the ethnographer is the chief data collection instrument, a few comments are in order regarding my expe- rience and perspective on the West. I did not grow up on a ranch or farm; my participation at this show was as a researcher, an outsider, and a visitor to this culture. Yet west- ern culture is not entirely foreign to me; I grew up in a small town in central Texas, outside of Waco, in a suburban area adjacent to rural farms. I went to school with those fondly referred to as "pig farmers" and "shit kickers" by themselves and others and have been fascinated with ranch life ever since. Having lived in the southwestern United States most of my life, I share western values for open spaces, interde- pendence with nature, fair competition, and respect for oth- ers. In doing this research, I questioned the development of my own values and gained greater appreciation for the roles of industry and historical tradition in contemporary culture. Methods of analysis initially involved organizing the data into summary form. I developed categories for the types of activities and agents (i.e., ranchers, boothsellers, and visitors) and then directed attention to identifying pat- terns and relationships among the elements of data (Lofland and Lofland 1995). I divided primary categories further into subcategories based on increasingly finer levels of distinc- tion. For example, ranchers distinguished themselves as 8Ranchers explained the timing of the show in January as less busy for them. Their annual cycle features calving in late February and March, breeding animals and cutting hay in summer, harvest- ing crops and sending animals to market in fall, and ranch mainte- nance in winter. Commodification of the American West / 87</page><page sequence="7">commercial versus purebred cattle producers and cow/calf operations versus feed lots and packers. Visitors and booth- sellers distinguished themselves as ranchers or city folk. I derived cultural principles and the meanings of the activities in a process of analyzing the relationships among agents and events at the show and paid attention to their various para- digmatic and metaphorical relations (Spiggle 1994) and dis- parities between discourse and practice (Arnould and Wallendorf 1994). For example, distinctions between com- mercial and breed producers proved to be important status markers among ranchers. I formed cultural principles based on the relationships between the cultural themes and cate- gories of agents and activities. Finally, I used triangulation and negative case studies to assess the findings (Miles and Huberman 1984; Spiggle 1994; Wallendorf and Belk 1989). I compared data across sources, agents, events, and research methods. This entailed comparison of participation and observational data, inter- views, photographs, and artifacts across various show events and types of participants. Negative case studies involved collecting and analyzing examples counter to the derived categories and themes. I actively sought evidence of cooper- ation, distancing people from the animals, social constraints, and gender egalitarianism for the purpose of evaluating themes, and sought the range and fit of data elements rela- tive to the emergent categories in evaluating the categories. Market Culture at the National Western Market Festival The National Western Stock Show and Rodeo is aptly described as a festival marketplace (See Figure 1). The show is a celebration of the industry as a historical tradition and as a rendezvous of multiple agents and show activities. Historical tradition. This stock show began in January 1899 as the regional meetings of the Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association (Simms 1981). Thirteen junior and professional contestants showed cattle, lambs, and hogs, and a baby contest and a rough-riding tournament provided entertainment. The show gained momentum from the sup- port of livestock merchants, stockyard executives, meat- packers, rail executives, local businessmen, and media. Over time, events have been added and deleted on the basis of industry and public response; for example, bull riding was eliminated in 1912 for being inhumane, only to be brought back in 1931 (Simms 1981). Historically, stock shows have featured distinct cattle and animal husbandry techniques (Ritvo 1987). An early example was the 3000-pound Durham ox, a Shorthorn that toured England and Scotland from 1801 to 1807, drawing as much as 97 pounds sterling a day in admittance fees. The spectacle of the early shows was linked to the royal titles of the owners and the pedigrees of the cattle, and public sup- port reinforced the breeders' social status. Both owners and animals were immortalized in scores of engravings pur- chased for household display (Ritvo 1987). Over time, producing pedigreed animals has come to be attributed more status than producing animals for food.

That is, the fatter the cattle, the greater was was their pres- tige. Yet although the animals' robustness enhanced their value to breeders, it decreased their value to commercial producers and consumers, as fatter animals were less fertile and less tasty. 9 These differences in status and market inter- ests created a rift between breeders and commercial produc- ers that continues today. It was not until the late 1970s that breeders began to produce leaner animals (Skaggs 1986) (see Photo 1 for a contrast of animals and meat in the 1950s and the 1990s). Today, the National Western is one of several cattle shows promoting the $40 billion U.S. agriculture industry (Purdu 1996).10 Cattle events predominate, but horses, hogs, lambs, rabbits, poultry, and even bison and elk are shown. The most pressing issues facing the beef industry are decreases in consumer demand and conflicts in the distribu- tion channel. Beef consumption has declined sharply in the United States, from a high of 129.8 pounds per capita per year in 1976 to 65.6 pounds in 1993 (Day 1994; Skaggs 1986). This is attributed to consumers' shift in preference to chicken and sales of leaner cuts of meat as the result of breeding and butchering practices.11 Present concerns 9Ranchers explained that a certain amount of fat is good because it gives the meat its taste, particularly when it is marbled (i.e., dis- tributed throughout the meat). Too much fat concentrated on the surface is neither aesthetically pleasing nor of economic value, for as rancher Michel Jordan noted, "It just gets sliced off at the packer anyway." Select cuts are the leanest; choice cuts are in the middle range; and prime cuts have the most fat, the best taste, and the highest price. 10Part of the funding for the National Western comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The agency consolidates and man- ages annual beef promotional expenditures of more than $1 billion (Biskupic and Farhi 1997). Other major cattle shows include the National Beef Exposition in Iowa and the Houston Stock Show. "lMeatpackers now butcher carcasses on site, selling boxed cuts directly to retailers and garnering the wages previously paid to retail butchers. Because packers dock ranchers for excess fat at slaughter, both commercial and breed producers have an incentive to raise leaner animals. 88 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="8">regarding the power of the meatpackers have a long history. As noted previously, the cattle industry moved west roughly 100 years ago, as producers profited from cheaper resources-land, grass, and labor. Ranchers resisted attempts to rationalize their industry at that time by organiz- ing. The 1905 show gained national prominence as site of the merger between two organizations of independent cattle producers, the National Livestock Association and the American Stock Growers Association (Simms 1981). To this day, the show may be seen as the attempts of producers to gain more control of the industry (Skaggs 1986).12 A rendezvous of multiple agents. The show grounds con- sist of approximately two square miles and include the stockyards, the coliseum where the rodeo is held, the sta- dium where various breed shows and sales and entertain- ment take place, three smaller auction arenas, and a large building for the booth exhibits. The show combines the large-scale industry promotion and trade of the exposition with the spectacular entertainment of the rodeo and the pop- ular consumer activities of touring the animal pens and mer- chandise booths. During the two-week event, millions of dollars change hands in stock sales, ticketed events, mer- chandising, food and drink, local accommodations, and other business tie-ins. Walking through the area, I see ranchers and city slick- ers milling about the cattle pens and merchandise booths. In the yards, hundreds of cattle of various breeds are held in pens, and others are tied along fences. Because the various breed events are held over a three- or four-day period-and one begins as another is ending-it is common to see ranch- ers moving cattle in and out. In preparation for the shows, the animals are groomed in steel holding frames; their fur is shaved, shampooed, and blow-dried; and their hooves are spray painted (Photo 2). Looking at the immaculately groomed animals, I find it easy to downplay the purpose of the show in producing them for food, though ample evi- dence of their ultimate destination is found in conversations, signs, and breed brochures. Often the animals are displayed showing their side or rear quarters, the valuable cuts of meat. Signs and bumper stickers promote genetic accom- plishments, such as "Shorthorns-they don't have to be black anymore" and "Simbrah-a little ear, a lotta rear." Western humor, such as that featured in these sales slo- gans, is widespread in boothseller pitches, show events, and interviews. It plays an important role in marking boundaries PHOTO 2 Spray Painting Hooves with "Touch up Black" ....... .. . . . . ...... . . ........ ..................... xx .... ...... ........ .. . . . . . . . .. .. ....... ... . . . ..... ......... .. ...... .. . . . . .. . . . . . ... . ... .. . . ..... -:xn . . ..... ... .... .... ....... ... ..... ........... between industry insiders and outsiders. Likely because of the importance of reproduction in the cattle business, much of the humor is sexual in nature. For example, while rancher Charlie Taylor was explaining his use of artificial insemina- tion to impregnate his cows, his friend joked, "Who brings the whiskey and cigarettes?" Other examples appear later in ranchers' descriptions of desirable breeding animals and livestock judges' results. The jokes provide valuable insight into the ranch way of life in poking fun at gender roles, dan- gerous animal husbandry activities, and the steadfast com- mitment to the business in working so hard for so little pay. Overall, the show emphasizes cattle production, yet it does so in a way that subordinates this theme to others much more romantic and appealing-freedom, naturalism, com- petition, and family values, as discussed subsequently. The show functions as a ritual of inversion (Turner 1982), in that key social positions, activities, and values are reversed for a specific period of time in achieving social ends. More important, in the reversals of values and behaviors from those expressed in daily life, key cultural principles are made intelligible. Notions of work and play and relations between consumers and producers, commercial and breed producers, women and men, and humans and animals are altered, uniting industry members who otherwise maintain conflicting interests to gain the favor of consumers. The ranchers come here to do business and watch others do business. The stock shows and sales especially entail business for them. Even so, the exaggerations of the rodeo and other animal performances dramatize their activities, reproducing cultural meanings that resonate with them as cultural insiders in ways different from those accessible to visitors. Ranchers identified themselves as either breeders or commercial producers, and their operations vary signifi- cantly in size and type of cattle (see Table 1). All ranchers represent family operations; most have multiple generations in the business, though some ranchers work for others' fam- ily operations. Also included are three rodeo cowboys. Ranchers consistently explain the division of labor that has evolved, separating cow/calf operations from feed lots and packers. Those with cow/calf operations maintain a herd of 12In 1920, the "Beef Trust" had so attracted government scrutiny that National Packing, owner of the stock show grounds, voluntar- ily dissolved itself to avoid further litigation and government- imposed dissolution (Skaggs 1986). By 1994, the "Big Four"- IBP Inc., Con Agra, National Beef, and Cargil-controlled 82% of the market for beef cattle nationwide, a concentration not seen since the 1920s (Algeo 1996). By April 1996, cattle prices had fallen to $55 per hundred weight, or $.55 a pound, down from $1.03 in 1993 (Hebert 1996). Although drought, competition with cheap imports, and overproduction were factors, rancher organiza- tions focused on the high concentration of the packers and filed a class action suit charging the Big Four with using their market share to drive down prices (Algeo 1996). In June 1996, U.S. Sec- retary of Agriculture Dan Glickman initiated an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department regarding competition in the industry. As of April 2000, the investigation was still pending. Commodification of the American West / 89</page><page sequence="9">TABLE 1 Ranchers Pseudonym Age Sex From Where Occupation 1.

The calves are raised until they are about seven months old, and then they are sold to the feeders. Feeders, in turn, fatten the cattle for the packers, who buy and slaughter the animals and then freeze and age the beef for sale to wholesalers, gro- cery chains, and restaurants. Commercial ranchers produce cattle for the consumer meat market, whereas breeders produce animals, semen, and embryos for other breeders and, to a lesser extent, commer- cial producers in improving their breeding stock. The dis- tinction is in the presence of breed production, as most breeders also produce commercial cattle, but few commer- cial operators produce breeding stock. Jerry Lawson explained the difference in terms of cost and purpose: "The show person wants an animal to look a certain way. The commercial man wants as many pounds per day as possi- ble.... Animals are brought to the show ring as an example of what show people believe is optimal style, but their meth- ods for getting there would break the guy doing it for a liv- ing.... It's a different world." The show is operated by and for breed producers, though commercial producers are the majority of industry partici- pants. The majority of ranchers interviewed identified them- selves as working with purebred cattle, and a large percent- age come from other states, whereas the few commercial producers interviewed were local. When successful, breed- ers earn a market premium; when less successful, they sell their animals to commercial producers or, at worst, at the baseline commodity price for commercial cattle listed on the Chicago Mercantile: $73.45 dollars per hundred pounds of live animal as of April 2000. The breeders may be consid- ered conspicuous producers in garnering prestige from the animals' higher market value, which includes the effects of winning in shows such as this. When questioned, breeders 90 /1 Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="10">note that they come to the show for the events of their par- ticular breed association plus a day or so.13 The smaller ranchers bring a crew of family members; the larger opera- tions bring family members and often a crew of hired hands. Jake Sherrel reported his activities as follows: "Booth space costs $150 a head, entry fees $100 (a head), bedding $1,500-$2,000 for three animals and three people. Wednes- day we'll show the heifers [young females that have not yet had a calf], Thursday the bull, and Thursday night is the sale." In contrast, commercial ranchers raise crossbreed and purebred cattle and cannot afford the high-priced breed ani- mals, though they may search for bargains to upgrade their herds. They attend the show to gain information. Some, like Gail and Jerry Lawson, come to promote their businesses. They have come to sell the pasture pump he developed and patented. They explain that few ranchers support themselves solely by raising cattle, which they describe as an expensive hobby. They have a herd of 50 Hereford cattle-"because they are so gentle," adds Gail. As is evident from Table 1, many ranchers maintain other jobs to continue their cattle business. Booth exhibitors include men and women, ranchers and nonranchers, though most live on ranches or their businesses depend on ranchers (see Table 2). Similar to the ranchers, many exhibitors have been coming to the show for years. They represent local and national businesses. Some make their living solely at shows like these and refer to them- selves as modern-day gypsies in traversing the country; oth- ers participate in this show alone or use it in conjunction with other marketing efforts. The circuits vary, which demonstrates the range and specialization of exhibitors' cul- tural prowess. The ranch-related businesses set up booths at other stock shows, farm and ranch expositions, and state fairs; nonranch merchants travel to New Age Expos, home and garden shows, auto fairs, and Star Trek conventions. The booths contribute to the western cultural ambience of the show as well. This is particularly true for the booths with horse and cattle equipment and supplies, clothing (hats, jeans, boots and belts, crafts) snakeskin wallets, buffalo hides and mounted deer heads, and the western cultural entertainment of the local dance halls. Booths for western events and tourist destinations, such as the Cheyenne Frontier Days and Dead- wood, S. Dak., contribute to the western aura of the show as well, as does the western art exhibit sponsored by Coors Brewery. The gallery features a red carpeted entrance into a room where paintings, sculptures, and photography of west- ern images-cattle, cowboys and cowgirls, Native Ameri- cans, and landscapes-compete for sale, and prizes are awarded on the basis of popular votes. Offering general appeal are the booths featuring automobiles, food and bever- ages, home furnishings, and appliances such as vacuum cleaners, irons, back massagers, and no-stick cookware. Yet even the general merchandise booths add touches of western culture in the aesthetics of product displays-for example, the use of cowboy motifs, products such as raw pine furniture, and western foods in demonstrating the kitchen appliances. Visitors include men, women, and children of all ages and are predominantly white (see Table 3).14 They provide a striking example of the consumption of production. As Heather Banks put it, many want to "show our kids where meat comes from." Here, visitors' consumption of cattle production contrasts with most other contemporary cultural venues, such as theme parks, zoos, and malls, where pro- duction is deemphasized. In their support of show activities, consumers join ranchers in producing western culture. Most come for the day from the Denver region, though others come from other areas in Colorado and other states. They don western attire, especially the kids; but adults, too, wear jeans, boots, hats, and bandanas. They tour the animal pens and merchandise booths, watch the entertainment in the sta- dium area, and go to the rodeo. "I love these $67 family out- ings," Alan Banks sarcastically remarked, relating his expenses, "$32 to get in, $25 for lunch, $5 to park, and still counting." The Banks were from Evergreen, just outside Denver, and had brought their two boys, Jeff and Cody, who were four and eight years of age. The boys reported that they liked the animals best. Cody enthusiastically told me he loved the bulls. Many of the visitors have ranching or farming back- grounds, though for most it is a generation or more removed. For them, the show conjures up nostalgia for a past selectively remembered, and they are quick to note changes from what they remember. The show attracts peo- ple without ranching backgrounds as well. For some, the show conjures up a longing for a past they have not experi- enced, a return to nature from their city or suburban life. Others, like the fabled city mouse, are fascinated by their rural counterparts, both idealizing the ranchers' way of life and admiring their highly efficient production, even as they are critical of environmental damage and use of chemicals and hormones. 13The breed associations are the centerpiece of breeders' activi- ties at the show. The organizations serve as important social net- works for people to catch up with friends and discuss issues affect- ing their business. Annual activities include electing officials, administering the annual sales and shows, and providing advice to members regarding production of the breed. 141 saw very few people of ethnic and racial minorities among ranchers, visitors, and boothsellers at the show, despite their pres- ence in the old and new West (Limerick 1987). However, the cul- tures of Native Americans, Mexicans, and Blacks are evident in the stands that sell Indian fry bread and tacos; the booths featuring jewelry, weavings, and paintings that portray cowboy, Native American, and Mexican people and their artifacts; and the enter- tainment. A separate art market featuring the work of Native Amer- ican artists is held at the same time across town. The one event well attended by Latinos is the Charro Extravaganza, which has become a successful part of the rodeo since its introduction three years ago. It features Mexican vaqueros (cowboys), a mariachi band, and famous Mexican singers and animal trainers and receives wide- spread promotion on the local Hispanic media. African Americans were represented by one bullfighter in the rodeo, one shoeshiner, a small scattering of visitors, and a booth sponsored by the African American Museum of the West in Denver that displays pho- tographs of early rodeo cowboys and businessmen. A sign there proclaims that one-third of cowboys in the Old West were Black. I observed no Asians at the show.

Every year the show begins with a parade, a western-dress contest for children, and a barbecue in downtown Denver. It is a symbolic interpenetration of the West of old into the modem city. Mounted police lead the parade, followed by a local horse-riding group; the West- ernnaires, bedecked in flags (Photo 3); the organizers and a few local dignitaries in covered wagons; and Miss Rodeo Colorado on horseback. Next come the sponsors-a local radio station, a couple of restaurants and country western bars, and the Coors draft horses. There are other special attractions-a man riding a longhorn steer, another atop a llama, and even a Buffalo Bill impersonator.15 A Safeway refrigerated truck marks a fitting ending to the parade, as 15As further evidence of the global appeal of the American West, this impersonator has made an international career portraying the western hero Buffalo Bill in promotions for tortilla chips in Paris, for British Airlines flights in London, and for the city of Denver (Husted 1998). 92 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="12">TABLE 3 Visitors Pseudonym Age Sex From Where Occupation 1.

The National Western Stock Show is the major national competition for eight breeds of cattle and a regional competition for eight others. 16 These stock shows are structured by the sex and age of the animals, for exam- ple, heifer calves or bulls born within a specific range of dates. The format is consistent: The animals are led around the ring, where judges examine their size, build, and carriage, as well as the ability of the people showing them (Photo 4). Show brochures detail important charac- teristics in discriminating among the animals: their blood- lines and such vital statistics as birth and weaning PHOTO 3 The Westernnaires Open the Parade il ,4X 0AI V.1. ::.......... 16In 2000, national shows were held for the Hereford, Braun- vieh, Maine-Anjou, Gelbvieh, Tarantaise, Limousin, Salers, and Highland breeds. Most shows are for individual purebred cattle, though one breed association holds a cow and calf competition designed to judge mothering abilities, and a few shows feature commercial crossbred cattle.

Cows are rated in their calving ease and milking ability, that is, unassisted births and weight gain of their calves per day before weaning; for bulls, scrotal circumference is listed. However, although these are use- ful measures, the animals' ultimate valuation takes place in the show and sales rings and in relation to the needs of particular breeders. Winning a show is important in determining desired characteristics and bloodlines, recognizing the top breeders, and setting a basis for differences in sales prices. Michel Jordan, who works for Maria Griswold, winner of the four top honors for the Highlands cattle in 1997, noted, "It's basi- cally an honor. Everybody brings their best, and the one that wins is the top of the best." Hearing him, Griswold com- mented, "The shows are a beauty contest-the color prefer- ence is crazy; you don't eat color!" Then she added in a seri- ous tone, "We've done a lot of winning. The shows set prices for the rest of the year on a lot of the purebred stock." Her show success has translated directly to market demand: There is a two-year waiting list to buy her purebred cattle. Important in the show ring are aesthetics-visible bod- ily proportions, muscle tone, and distinctive sex characteris- tics. Early on in the project, research assistant Michelle Detry made an insightful comparison of the shows to human beauty pageants on the basis of striking similarities in grooming in the use of makeup to enhance features, sprays to shine hooves, and anti-inflammatory creams to remedy puffy eyes.17 Overlaps between animal shows and human beauty contests are noted in the consumer behavior odyssey video as well (Wallendorf and Belk 1987). Sex distinctions are crucial in this business based on reproduction, and they are marked with the humor of anthropomorphism. I use the term "gender slippage" to describe the process in which people attribute to cattle human masculine and feminine characteristics. An example was rancher Sam Dixon, who grinned as he explained the show criteria to me: "It's the same things you'd look for in a man. The eyes; three dimensions in the rear end; muscle depth, width, and volume; and scrotum circumference in an acceptable range." Noted rancher Carol Silver, "Girls are supposed to look like girls, not with a big old gawky head. You ought to be able to look at their heads to tell the males from the females. A female who looks like a bull in the face just isn't gonna be worth it to work with." The importance of sex distinctions also is evident in judge Mike Picken's selection: When you look on your performance sheets, you can see that there is only five pounds difference in the two heifers. One has a lot larger frame and isn't carrying as much fat; the other with a smaller frame, yet much more visually appealing--carrying more conditioning, and she certainly has more expression in muscle. When you get behind her and watch her move-I am a person who really likes pat- tern, style, and balance. Basically, that is what I am using the heifer in first for. Because she has got the pattern.... I like a female that has a look that I feel is attractive, and I think this female comes closer to fitting that pattern ... a female that puts things together ... straight and lean on the top and a hip design and a really nice hind leg." The shows imperfectly impose market constraints on the breeders. Although the production statistics are precise, they are but pieces of information weighed by the judges in con- junction with visible aesthetics, the animals' performance, and the skills of those showing them. Ranchers attribute much variation to judges, as is evident in T.J. Anderson's and Carol Silver's phrasing in separate interviews: "It all comes down to one man's opinion one day." The stock sales are another important element of the show. Each of the breed associations holds an annual auc- tion. Prominently featured are the auctioneer, breed presi- dent, Breed Association Queen, a veterinarian, and several 17Over the show's long history, various techniques have been used to display animals, at times crossing the line of ethical behav- ior. In 1972, in a well-publicized scandal, Big Mac, a Charolais crossbreed, won the Junior Angus competition (Simms 1981). The normally greyish-white animal had been dyed black, a technique that took unfair advantage of its larger frame to beat the smaller Angus entrants. The cheating was reported by the parents of the youth who raised the animal. The boy had recognized it at a show because it slobbered on him, "like he always did" (Simms 1981, p. 191). Blood tests corroborated the animal's identity. Strict rules were put into effect at that time regarding the use of visual enhancements (Simms 1981). Even so, clever presentation tech- niques continue, such as parting the hair of a hog down the middle of its back to make it look broader, balling up the end of a bull's tail to make the rump look rounder, and positioning a show lamb against the exhibitor's thigh to force the animal to flex its rear mus- cles and emphasize their definition. 94 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="14">spotters. Spotters note the bids, alternatively scanning the audience and screaming the upped antes back to the auc- tioneer, who in turn raises the going price. As in the shows, brochures detail each animal's accomplishments and char- acteristics. The format entails single animals or groups brought in by numbered lots and sold to the highest bidder. At times, the entire live animal is sold; at other times, par- tial interest, frozen embryos, or "straws" of semen are sold. Also negotiated are ownership and possession rights.18 Much speculation is made regarding which will sell, for how much, and to whom, and eyes are attuned to industry leaders. The sales price is a key indicator of value, and there is tremendous variation within and among breeds in selling prices. In general, bulls sell for higher prices than do heifers or cows, and the outstanding stock of the most commonly produced breeds in the United States, the Hereford and Angus, and the exotic breeds, such as Limosin, Gelbvieh, and Braunvieh, garner the most money. The highest sales prices I observed were $74,000 for a Hereford bull and $52,000 for a Braunvieh heifer. The more painful side of the market is devaluation. Noted rancher Justin Murphy, "It's hard to see folks who've worked years in genetics with three Grand Champions sell animals worth $1,200 to $1,500 for $600 to $700." Although Murphy is unwilling to attribute the low price to the lack of distinct genetic characteristics for the animals, it is likely a factor, as is the current volume of commercial cattle production and the health of the U.S. economy overall.19 One sale in particular, the Junior Livestock Auction of Champions, gets much publicity each year as a philan- thropic event. Local and regional businesses vie to outdo each other in buying livestock raised by young ranchers (Photo 5). The auction begins with a barbecue supper pro- vided by Coors brewery and features musical entertainment and a nationally renowned cowboy poet as emcee. The event is an important rite of passage for the junior contestants. It is the culmination of a profound process of socialization into the industry for them, as here concepts and behaviors so fun- damental to industry participation-responsibility, hard work, market gains and losses, status in the community, and the loss of animal life-are established. One by one, the contestants lead the winners into the arena, each as excited by the prospect of earning money for college scholarships as daunted by losing the animal. They have come a long way to be here, having selected and cared for their animals over the past year and having won top honors just days earlier in the respective shows for cattle, lambs, and hogs.

These youths truly are "the future of the industry," as the auctioneer calls them, yet their numbers are dwindling, more because of lack of economic ability than lack of interest. The average age of U.S. farmers and ranchers is 58 years (McClain 1997). Tommy Marks, from Longmont, Colo., exemplifies these junior ranchers. He and his family raise 20 Angus cows at home. He has been coming to the stock show since he can remember; an early highlight was riding a pony in the parade when he was 5. Now 13, he has shown at sev- eral county fairs. At school he is active in the 4-H club and is learning to judge rabbits and quarter horses. What is most impressive about ranch youths such as Tommy is their sense of responsibility as they talk about the importance of the live- stock industry to the country. Ranchers credit many factors for the waning presence of youths in ranching careers-the prohibitively high cost of land; low prices for grain and cat- tle; the growing inability of ranches to support extended fam- ilies and multiple generations, as was done in the past; and difficulty competing with large agribusinesses. This is not limited to agriculture in the United States; Kelly (1992) has noted similar trends in Japan. The junior auction provides a symbolic payback to the community as well; businesspeople pay a premium for meat with a high variance in quality. In 1992, Jerry Tucker's Grand Champion steer Fonto sold for $18,000 to Paul's Place Restaurant and Lombardi Meat Packers, and in 1997, Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse paid $80,000 to Justin Davidson for his Grand Champion, Taz.20 These sales prices index the economic health of local businesses, partic- ularly those in the beef industry. It is no coincidence that the purchasers are meatpackers and steak house owners, not commercial producers or breeders. Observed rancher Tony Garrett, "We're hurting with the low price of beef at 65 cents a pound. On a $6 steak we get 65 cents." 181n addition to these live auctions, purebred cattle are sold at informal sales between neighbors and in the public sales of large ranches. Although interest in satellite and Internet sales is growing, it remains limited to commercial stock, which suggests breeders' persistent reliance on their sensory discrimination. 19The bids for individual purebred cattle reflect individual ani- mal characteristics and past breeder success, as well as the current strength of commercial cattle prices and the U.S. economy. The previously mentioned decreasing trend in beef consumption took a positive turn in 1999. The small increase has been attributed to the growing popularity among consumers of the protein diet in losing weight, abated health concerns, and economic prosperity (Carpen- ter 2000). 20Del Frisco ended Paul's Place's seven-year tradition of buying the Grand Champion steer and then donating the meat to the poor. In 1996, the donation came to roughly $70 per pound for the 700 pounds of meat the carcass yielded. Though a remarkably ineffi- cient way to feed the poor, the significance of the gesture is the way it amplifies the status of the corporate purchaser in another example of conspicuous production. Commodification of the American West / 95</page><page sequence="15">Although cattle trade is the main purpose of the National Western Stock Show, its entertainment attracts thousands of people each year. Ranchers and visitors alike mention the reenactment of the Old West as one of its main purposes. Many entertainment events are anchored in historic ranch practices yet have been modified for dramatic effect in building the spectacle of the show-for example, "break- ing" horses (i.e., getting them used to being ridden) being extended to bulls in the rodeo. Important features of the entertainment include the fascination with the animals, the drama of the rodeo, the novelty of the merchandise booths, the colorful personalities of their hucksters, and the throng of ranch and city folk milling about. The mix of business and entertainment creates a festive atmosphere for city and rural residents. Commented rancher Matthew Webb, "The show is as close [to the West] as they'll [visitors] get. Here, they get to associate and reminisce about what no longer is and will never be again." The highlight of the entertainment is the rodeo. It is the first event of the year for the Professional Rodeo Association and an important part of the show's cultural functioning. Although it powerfully evokes the wild, this sporting contest should be seen as a performance of its taming. More than 1000 entrants pay an entry fee of $200 to compete for $450,000 in prizes. The prizes for the various events indicate a progressive market valuation for animal domestication. Event winnings are largest for the most dangerous activity, the bull riding, at $48,000 (Photo 6), followed by the barrel racing at $41,000, the only event open to women. Also a fac- tor is the symbolic link of the events to western lore-the saddle bronc champion earns $38,000, the bareback winner $35,000, and the winning cattle ropers $33,000 each for the two-man team. The sponsors-Dodge trucks, Skoal smoke- less tobacco, Stokes chili, KYGO country-and-western radio, and United Airlines-provide funds and gain visibility. The rodeo retains idealized forms of business and soci- ety for informants in their descriptions of its competitive PHOTO 6 Bullriding Rodeo Cowboy .................. .... . ... . .. .......... . ... .. ... ... . ..~Yi... ....... . W ~m.. ... ...... . . . . . . .. . . . . spirit, symbolic domestication of animals, and family and small-town ethos. Here, visitors cross the frontier from their everyday lives into the mythical Old West, that imagined place outside the civilized and the modem that is inhabited by animals that need to be tamed and cowboys to do the rough-and-tumble work. A western band plays as the crowd filters in, and most of the rodeos sell out. Each show opens dramatically with the coliseum lights turned out. The voice of the announcer booms, introducing the Westernnaires as they ride into the arena at full gallop, red lights attached to their hats and horses flowing in interwoven geometric pat- terns. Between the rodeo events are entertainment and spe- cial activities, including the performances of clowns, the nationally renowned Budweiser Clydesdales, and the rival Coors Draft horses; appearances by well-known animal trainers and singers; and competitions among children from the audience in the "mutton-bustin" sheep riding and catch- a-calf contests. Ranchers describe rodeo cowboys as another breed. Young and predominantly male, they have come to symbol- ize the romantic ideals of the West in a special way. Their nomadic lifestyle of traveling the rodeo circuit embodies freedom from ties of business and society and naturalism in working in close proximity to animals; both qualities are mentioned by many ranchers and nonranchers in their asso- ciations with the West. Boothsellers Darryl Jackson, former world champion saddle bronc rider, and fellow rodeo cow- boy Lonnie Frederick explain that the animals are bred to buck and credit a good part of their scores to the animal's talent in bucking. They are here as endorsers for the sports bar Hooters. Stated Darryl, "We cowboys love these ani- mals-they're our livelihood, and they're fantastic! Just look at them, their athletic ability. It's in their nature. Last month at the [Pro Rodeo] Finals, Airwolf, owned by Arnie Franklin, was let run in the arena. Seeing him brought tears to my eyes. These animals are athletes." Lonnie added, "People say we're mistreating the animals, but these animals are treated better than most people-even if they just thought one was hurt they'd have a vet come see it!" When competing, contestants' names and towns of origin are announced. This custom strongly anchors the cowboys' identities with the town they are from, as does their treat- ment there as heroes (Lawrence 1982). Even so, the lives of the rodeo cowboys are not as free as they seem. When compared with athletes in other sports, professional rodeo athletes garner modest incomes and con- front major risks.21 In contrast to the admiration for the ani- mals expressed by Jackson and Frederick are sobering sto- ries of injuries and drug abuse. Boothseller Mark Nelson, a former bull rider and bullfighter (also known as rodeo clown, a term he deplores), recounts to me his injuries-six cracked ribs, a broken jaw, a torn diaphragm, and a lost tooth in 15 years of work. He is here in full makeup and baggy overalls promoting Chevrolet automobiles and the video he produced on drug and alcohol prevention with financial support from Chevrolet. It was a hard sell, despite 21As listed in the 1996 rodeo program, annual earnings for the top ten cowboys and cowgirls across events typically fall in the $50,000 to $60,000 range, with highs of $150,000. 96 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="16">rather widespread drug use among rodeo cowboys, he explains: "People have the image of the Marlboro man, not drug addicts." Even so, he beams with pride as he tells me of his son's plans to ride bulls when he turns 18, "Ain't noth- ing else an 18-year-old can do and earn $100,000." Other entertainment activities celebrate the ritual domestication of animals as well. Featured are contests for humans driving mules and horses harnessed to carriages; dogs compete in pulling weights and tending sheep, and horses compete in cutting calves from their herd. Each of the contests has its own rules and objectives, both of which are explained by the announcer. Rancher and visitor informants report attending specific events, as well as simply passing time between other activities. For example, visitor Donna Aiello told me she has come specifically to see the unicorn three-horse hitch and emphasizes the animals' graceful movements despite their tremendous size. In this event, the drivers maneuver three horses harnessed to a carriage. As I watched the event with her, my initial amusement was altered by her comments, and I gained appreciation for the skill of the drivers in maneuvering the horses. Educational activities include university-sponsored cat- tlemen's update seminars, corporate demonstrations, and cattle grading events. The seminars are important sites of socialization and clash with the naturalist discourse of rancher informants. Here, ranchers are encouraged to assim- ilate modern industry practices, such as artificial insemina- tion and inoculations. For example, faculty members from Colorado State University emphasize the benefits of using hormones to synchronize the estrus cycles of the cows for more uniform breeding and calving. At another seminar, SmithKline Beecham representatives teach ranchers to vac- cinate their cattle on the neck and lower legs to stem the pur- ported $22 million in annual losses from bruises and scars on the rear quarters, the conventional site for human vaccines. Finally, merchandising is important in bringing together city and ranch folk. In the aptly named Education Hall, more than 600 booths representing large retail stores, individual entrepreneurs, and government organizations pay a mini- mum of $500 to pitch ideas and items for sale to the mass of attendees. The booths promote everything from farm and ranch equipment and supplies to household products and home furnishings to ideas about land management and trap- ping to automobiles, clothing, and food. They vary in price by location and size; prime sites are located along the main walkways to the rodeo, whereas less desirable ones are located along the periphery of the hall and the coliseum. The largest booths, the Beef Council and Doug Rainey's western clothing, occupy entire sides of the building. The booth exhibitors vary in their approaches. Some merely display products and attend to those who approach them. Christine Riley's western clothing booth fits this cat- egory. Most others attract people to their booth with small talk, as the Lawsons did with me in promoting their busi- ness. Still others hold contests or raffles; examples include the booths for the Greeley Stampede and a Ford automobile dealer. At the Ford truck booth, buxom women pass out entry forms for winning a new truck and sell T-shirts that read, "This is your brain, Ford. This is your brain on drugs, Chevrolet." The salsa maker, stovetop grill, and nonstick cookware booths are popular for their demonstrations and product pitches. As Sherry (1988) noted, the pitches follow various formats of roles, scripts, and extemporaneous dia- logues with consumers. The most aggressive boothsellers call out to persons passing by, beckoning them over with a joke or sample. Some even wear microphone headsets to broadcast their performances; a few of those passing by always stop and watch, while fewer still buy (Photo 7). The boothsellers sell items on the spot or for later shipment, take inquiries for information, and refer prospective customers to local dealers. Examples include kitchen appliances, local universities, in-home spas, and cattle chutes, respectively. Education is an important element of the merchandise booths as well. At once like a mall but with western accou- trements, the Education Hall is a liminal zone that transitions visitors from the familiarity of shopping to the lesser-known context of ranch life and the even lesser-known products and services related to animal handling and meat production. Many boothsellers come to present their organization's ideas, educating and, in some cases, reeducating the public. Exam- ples include the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Horse Rescue service, and the American Trappers Association. Mechanisms of Cultural Negotiation Contested discourses ofwestern meanings and values. Dis- cursive themes rife with complexity and contradiction pervade this stock show (see Figure 1). Mechanisms through which cultural meanings are produced by marketers include contested discourses and relational practices, both of which occur inter- nally among marketers and between marketers and consumers. Thus, the National Western stock show is conceptual- ized as an intersection of multiple markets and cultures (see Figure 3). Although the show is bounded temporally and spatially, its borders of time and place are readily crossed in the activities, interactions, and imaginations of ranchers, booth exhibitors, and visitors. In Figure 3, participants, show activities, and cultural meanings come together in a PHOTO 7 Boothseller Demonstrating No-Stick Pans i "4 ...... ... ...........- ... . ..... ............... ...........

The market is constructed in meanings and values of marketers and consumers. Western meanings and values are constructed in the cross-fertilization of agents' imagined and actual social practices. mix of remnants of the mythic West and elements of mod- ern industry. The orb at the right of Figure 3 graphically depicts the overlapping domains of agents whose activities are mapped out as vectors linked to the orb at the left, which consists of discursive meanings and values that constitute the show. Each of the themes is represented as a circle com- posed of two parts: an imaginary component that encom- passes the romanticized cultural values of the western past and a shaded region that represents the manifestation of cul- tural meanings expressed in agents' market discourse and practices. Tensions within and between these cultural mean- ings and values are detailed as follows. The first theme, freedom, was expressed by ranchers and projected onto them by visitors in interviews. Significantly, as ranching becomes more modernized and ranchers become more domesticated into the economic rationale of the industry, shows such as this provide a compensating cul- tural mechanism in retaining mythic attributes of freedom for ranchers in their lifestyles and for visitors in their pil- grimages here. Ranchers mention freedom in general terms as they speak of making a living raising animals and work- ing the land. Yet ranchers profess doubts regarding their ability to survive in this industry that contrast with the inde- pendence and self-sufficiency they claim as the rewards for their efforts. Furthermore, although there is some leeway in production techniques, competing in the market severely constrains ranchers' individualism. Ironically, freedom is most applicable to commercial cow/calf operators whose "hobby ranches" distance them somewhat from market con- straints, and breeders whose resources garnered from com- mercial cattle sales or other businesses offer them a similar autonomy, as the market prices can be severely constraining. For visitors, the cowboy is the key link between the show and the Old West. They speak of the lifestyles of the cowboys in maintaining some of the country's most dear cultural traditions. As Doug Daniels put it, "The spirit of the West is here-big sky, great mountains, cowboys, good friendly people. We grow the grain. We grow the beef that goes all over the world. The West is still free." James Night referred to the West as the "backbone of America." The show conjured up the freedom of the way things used to be for Cindy Patterson, and Sue Snyder emphasized ranchers' independent lifestyle: "You can do your own thing." Even so, several visitors acknowledge the ways ranch life departs from their ideals but retain these ideals nonetheless, often with humor. Patterson spoke of being seduced by the myth of the West. Walter Emory scoffed, "Of course everybody has an idea that out west it's wild country!" Alejandro Nufiez noted that though ranching departs from the John Wayne version, in that its conformity goes against the myths of free- dom and individualism, he would not live anywhere else. The rodeo expresses another type of freedom. When embodied in the romantic lives of the rodeo cowboys, freedom is equated with rough activities and risk taking. It, too, is situ- 98 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="18">ated outside modernized beef production, in the competitive market of the professional rodeo circuit. More important, the rodeo has a complex cultural function at the stock show in dis- placing themes of production with those of the West. Ranchers Marty and Bob Patton and Ed Canelli agreed that the empha- sis on the rodeo and show animals detracts from ranchers' commercial activities. Canelli described the rodeo as a tool to bring in masses of people but easily glided over distinctions between the breed and commercial cattle markets, adding, "Not often do you get so much exposure for your product." The second theme, naturalism, encompasses discourses and practices related to the normative place for humans' con- sumption of animals for food, humans' interdependence with animals, and a hands-off approach to cattle production. Sev- eral ranchers and visitors referred to the social importance of providing food. Stated rancher Joe Bob Evans, "Urban people have forgotten that without agriculture there is no food." Vis- itor James Knight noted, "There's nothing better for you than beef. It's the best source of protein there is." Despite the honor of the job, a few ranchers expressed ambivalence regarding the business of producing life forms and relied on biblical teachings giving humans dominion over animals in soothing their doubts. Stated Matthew Webb, "It's a noble job-feeding mankind-animals and their beauty, that's God's idea. Why, these products were put on this earth to be managed by man." Steven Gatlin asked and answered his own question, "Why do I struggle to keep a calf alive when I know he has to die? Why, I produce these things for our betterment. It comes back to God's will. The good Lord put animals here to provide us with high-quality protein. This dominion isn't to take advantage of though; it's a responsibility." Naturalism also was evident in commercial and breed ranchers' statements regarding their bonds with the animals and their interdependence with them; ranchers implicitly and explicitly acknowledged respect for the animals in making a living. Ranchers spoke with enthusiasm about working with animals, grazing them on the open land, and seeing calves born. Kim Dugan compared her dad's ranching to the Native American way of life, in that it is not wasteful. He rotates the cattle in the pastures, and now wildlife has returned. At times these attachments conflict with ranchers' business activity. Gail Lawson summed it up: "It's like selling a piece of the PHOTO 8 Ultrasound Measures the Rib Eye Thickness of This Simbra . ... .. ; ... . ... .......... . ... ..... ... .... . ....... * ?Al x: ~ -XY.: N:?~. "Big ~ i~IN ~ ?-t---;.-. ax family!" Noted Michel Jordan, "It's tougher to sell those ani- mals, but you got to come right to it; if you don't sell 'em, you'd be outa business, so you've got to try and keep that attitude because you get attached to them-combing, brush- ing, and feeding does make it harder emotionally." Commercial cow/calf operators and breeders report strong attachments to their cattle because of the length of time they work with them. Cows, which form the basis of the business, can be kept ten years or more; some of the female calves are kept to increase the size of the herd, and others are sold as "replacement heifers." Joking, Brad Williams exaggerated the age of some of his cows as "old enough to buy beer," as he noted the distinctions he has observed in their personalities. In contrast, the path for commercial male calves goes more directly to the packer, with the exception of those with desired qualities used for herd sires or "clean-up" bulls that impregnate cows for which previous attempts at artificial insemination fail. The closeness breeders express toward their animals is the result of their greater cost and the intense time and money spent showing them. Regarding her work with purebred Gel- bvieh cattle, Carol Silver stated, "It's a German breed, imported. Some animals you're with every day. Females get to stay, you get so attached to 'em. Some you can call right out of the pasture. You name them and get to know their personal- ities." She strongly refuted criticisms of animal mistreatment: "Let me tell you something, these animals are cleaner than my kids. They eat before we eat.... Most people who put the time, money, and effort into show animals are not mistreating them." She noted it had cost her $1,500 to show her heifer. Juxtaposed with this bonding and interdependence is the tayloresque, economically driven, high-tech side of animal husbandry. Commercial producers, in particular, display the practices of highly technical, rationalized mass production, though there are important differences between large and small commercial producers. Large operators, particularly feed lots, as a rule do not handle the animals except to vaccinate or brand this "meat on the hoof." Breeders excel in the marriage of genetic engineering and animal husbandry. Rancher Marie Griswold described artificial insemination as "wonderful-it gives you a chance to tap into more gene pools." The semen from prize bulls routinely is frozen and transported great dis- tances, which results in less stress on the animals and greater progeny. For cows, fertilization drugs exponentially increase the number of eggs produced in any one cycle. Upon fertiliza- tion, multiple embryos are transferred to other cows or heifers. Instruments such as ultrasound enable precise measurements of the amount and location of fat (Photo 8); formerly, this information was available to breeders only at slaughter. In deriving this theme, I was struck by the contrast of ranchers' interview responses that emphasize their natural way of life with their use of scientific animal husbandry practices. Many of the regular business practices of ranchers depart from what would be considered natural, as ranch activities entail managing, if not curtailing, nature in breed- ing cattle, growing crops, and killing predators, often with the use of chemical pesticides and steroids. The use of steroids and growth hormones is controversial in both breed and commercial aspects of the business. In interviews, ranchers denounced the use of these substances, even as they said they had to use them to compete successfully in the Commodification of the American West / 99</page><page sequence="19">industry. The few ranchers who produce organic meat in more humane conditions noted that these practices depart from industry standards. For example, rancher Marie Gris- wold has developed a niche for organic meat. In describing the meat she produces, she exclaimed, "Once you've eaten it, its' heaven! Nobody wants to eat drugs. I don't even want to eat meat when I hear that!" She vaccinates and gives antibiotics only when she has to, explaining, "you don't want to see anything die." The 1995 Junior Auction was mired in controversy when the Junior Champion was dis- qualified for using growth hormones. Evidently, the young rancher had learned the business too well. Significantly, the drug testing program remains limited to junior ranchers. Health and environmental concerns were expressed by a minority of informants. Of 28 ranchers, 8 stated they con- tinued to eat meat on a daily basis; 2 replied that though they believed they should cut back, they had not. I was surprised to see T.J. Anderson order a salad and his wife Claire order fish when we dined together after one of the sales. Claire explained that T.J. had to limit his intake of red meat because of a heart condition. Only 4 of the ranchers had stopped eating meat altogether. Frowning, Amy Lane said she shared consumers' concerns about hormones and steroids, which was why she seldom eats burgers. Three of the ranchers admitted they ate only the beef they produced because they knew what went into it. Visitors, too, raised concerns regarding the treatment of the animals and the impact of red meat on their health. Jenny Reynolds, Alejan- dro Nufiez, Sue Snider, and Mary Hawkins were concerned about the treatment of the rodeo animals, and Nufiez, Heather Banks, Doug Daniels, and Darlene Lawrence were concerned about ranchers' use of steroids. Six visitors reported having cut back their consumption of red meat; five believed they should cut back but had not, and four believed PHOTO 9 The Junior Fed Beef Champion ..: . . . . ...-- -- ? .... . . . : .. . . ...... ~~~ .:1.-.?..-.l.

I highlight two booths for their contrast of naturalism and science in their symbolic rendering of animal production. The Beef Council booth attracts visitors with video scenes of cow- boys tending cattle at sunset, technicians in white jackets supervising a production assembly line, and a nuclear family sitting down to dinner. Visitors interact with displays that explain the amount of feed consumed daily by cattle, the nutritional contents of beef versus chicken, and the foreign markets for U.S. beef. The Safeway booth focuses on grocery shopping and meals: Its tasteful displays are garnished with colorful vegetables, and recipes are available from a nearby rack. Every year the most noteworthy part of this booth is added after the Junior Fed Beef Contest, however. At this time the Grand Champion animals are "dressed" and hung from a meat hook with signs showing such production statistics as weight and quality grade. Reactions to the sides of beef range from men's jokes of hunger to parents' explanations to their children of where hamburger comes from to women's and children's disgusted grimaces and intent fascination (Photo 9). For visitors, the children's area is a dramatic representa- tion of the naturalization of animal production as well. It consists of Ranchland, various animal pens, and booths. Ranchland, sponsored by the Denver Post and the Future Farmers of America, is one of the most popular show attrac- tions. Wandering around inside a fence are baby goats and sheep, and a calf and two piglets are kept in wooden pens designed for petting (Photo 10). Nearby is a series of fenced PHOTO 10 Petting a Piglet at Ranchland ::::::::: '::::::::::::::::i i .............. i  , .. . . . .. . ... .... ...iiiiiiii:iiiiiiii ii::: " . . .  .. ...,... . .... . . . ..... ........ . . . .. . . . ... ...... . - - - -.... . . . ............ ii8I:i8;ii888818 : ?:i--::iiii:-i:.:::~ij iii!=#: .. .. - :::::::~:::;:3:i:~:';'-; c -- ----------:j: .... ... . lii~~'r'~:::::::ji:::j::::::! nr?;?;;?;? ~;:--------- --~':' ...... ----r~w : :I?:W P ------- ----------- --: .. .. .. .. .. . - - - - - - - - - -:: :?~ 100 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="20">pens holding mother and baby farm animals, and signs relate colorful stories of the animals-for example, Bud the turkey, who defended his partner Betty and their owners' backyard, and Calamity Jane, the goose that liked to travel in a car. The signs then list the animals' uses for food, jack- ets, and bedding. The children are encouraged to bond with the animals as pets as they are taught their productive uses, in ways parallel to the experiences of ranchers. Finally, the rodeo dramatically demonstrates the ten- sions between naturalism and animal domestication. Here, contestants routinely tame the wild in a manufactured ritual produced as the effect of breeding and a strap tightened around the animal's lower pelvis. Even so, the wild inces- santly exceeds the borders of its production, as there are accidents from time to time, some of which are fatal. In reenacting the domestication of animals for the pleasure of spectators, the rodeo brings forth the raw immediacy of nature, the life and death forces that are missing in the reg- ulated and sanitized existence of city people as well as most of those working within the division of labor of the modem beef industry. The specialization and division of labor in the industry that separate cow/calf operations and feeders from slaughter- houses likely contributes to the reproduction of naturalistic values. Most ranchers avoid the violence of animal death and dismemberment, even as their business entails reproducing life forms. Although they deal with the grave challenges of the animals' sickness, death, or loss due to sale, these parts of the business are altogether different from experiencing directly the carnage of large-scale animal slaughter, euphemistically called "dressing" and "packing."22 I noted the third theme, competition, throughout the show, among breeders and their animals for the status awards and for top dollar, among the rodeo contestants, between the con- testants and their animals, and certainly among the exhibitors for the attention and dollars of thousands of people milling about. Competition is evident as both a means and an end. As a means, competition establishes relations between agents. In the sales and show rings, the rodeo, and even the booths, the ethic of winning prevails, mobilizing efforts geared to eco- nomic rewards. Paradoxically, competition spurs the building of community as well, as ranchers cope with the competitive venues by working together and pooling their efforts. Exam- ples include breed competitors lending a hand in grooming others' animals, rodeo cowboys encouraging one another, booth exhibitors tending to one another's shops, and ranchers talking about helping one another out at home. As an end, the business of ranching is simultaneously a cultural way of life and a way of making a living. Closely linked in the western imaginary are the values of freedom and market autonomy, both of which are challenged in the day-to-day work of the cattle industry. Significantly, com- petition as a part of U.S. market ideology has come under question by ranchers competing with and losing out to large corporate farms. Noted Lois Powell, who runs 1700 Sim- mental cattle, "In 1973 we took a $100,000 loss-for the big money men, that's a tax deduction. We'd leased 400 acres of land for $45-$50 an acre; then corporations came in and gave $85-they get a subsidy. It's a dog eat dog world." Although all working ranches receive favorable tax treatment as businesses, larger ranches benefit dispropor- tionately from economies of scale. Several ranchers reported that they felt pressure to produce in ever larger quantities. Rancher Meg Murphy stated that she did not like the mass production of animals, which her husband Justin simply called a necessity. Explained rancher Steven Gatlin, "Everybody is trying to outproduce--one more bushel per acre is what made this country great. The downside is it's an advantage for big businesses. American production is too efficient. It's allowed our quality of life, but we can't com- pete, and everyone needs to make a living. It doesn't matter to the market that it's a person's livelihood." The business requires a fairly large investment, which is an obstacle to market entry for youths, including those raised on family ranches, as previously mentioned. Booth- seller David Haynes is a good example. In addition to help- ing his parents with their farm, he manages the Future Farm- ers of America program at a local high school, and his sister works as a nurse. He explains, Old timers in overalls---don't look like there's a lot of money there. They'll walk in and get to talking and you find they're multimillionaires, [but] ... it's all tied up in machinery and cattle and land. They never have much in their billfold. It's just the way of life. Just the way it is. Old timers are free of debt, so they live a pretty good life. It's a lot harder on young people. Farms can't sustain two or three families like they used to, and so young people have to find our own niche somewhere, and often it's not right back to production or back to the farm or ranch. Other concerns with competition are that the stock show serves the breed market in distorting cattle production toward show aesthetics and away from the attributes consumers and commercial producers are seeking--leaner, tastier meat prod- ucts and production-efficient animals, respectively. Rancher and visitor Barb Patton lamented the commercialism at the show, which she attributes to the competitive tactics of the booth merchandisers. Other ranchers blame themselves for the drop in consumer demand, because they have not attended to social trends and examined their activities in relation to con- sumers. Matthew Webb mentioned similarities in the trends toward leanness in animals and humans, noting how both wax and wane with the economy, and added, "The big problem was we produced what we liked and failed personally and indus- trywide to see if that's what the customer wanted." Thus, competition entails both a social process of judg- ment and a basis for doling out rewards, ultimately negoti- ating market demands and those of cultural life. Signifi- cantly, the belief in the market as an arbiter of value prevails for ranchers, despite their concerns. They praise the work- ings of market competition, even as they deplore their losses to competitors and accept government funds designed to 22To this day, packinghouses have the highest rate of workplace accidents. In 1992, meatpacking plants reported that 44.4% of their workers had suffered injuries, compared with 8.9% of employees overall (Associated Press 1997). The speed of the disassembly line is the main reason: Workers from the Monfort plant in Greeley, Colo., have testified that as many as 400 carcasses pass through the cutting floor in an hour (Andreas 1994). Commodification of the American West 1 101</page><page sequence="21">soften its more brutal blows.23 Matthew Webb emphasized the importance of marketing to ranchers' survival and was heavily critical of industry centralization whereby the Beef Council has come to promote the industry overall. He stated, "We're at the mercy of the chicken, turkey, and pig people. If we don't market our own, we can't control our own des- tiny." Webb suggested bringing the Beef Council more under the control of commercial beef producers, which are more in touch with consumers than purebred cattle produc- ers, a point I elaborate in the Implications and Conclusions section. The final theme, family values, deals with gender rela- tions at the show. At the level of the imaginary, ranching is a way of life enmeshed in social bonds within the family and the larger community and in codes of hard work, honesty, and friendliness. The importance of family ties was stressed by all ranchers-Mom, Dad, the kids, and often some extended family members were involved. Visitors attribute traditional family values to ranchers as well, even as they note their appeal. Noted Shelly Kessler, It's a "kind of friendly, laid-down attitude. It relates to the land, the moun- tains, the prairies. It's a style, a way to dress, an attitude-- the kind of attitude that comes with the cowboys. It's diffi- cult to explain. It's in how they treat people, how they treat women and kids. They're honest and very trusting." However, upon analysis, gender relations demonstrate the complexities and contradictions of male dominance. Women simultaneously play significant and subordinate roles here. Those showing animals are mostly men, though I noticed a few women. Traditional women's roles of cook- ing and caring for the family are common in interviews and in the booths. I accepted the gracious offer of a poster from a representative for the Colorado Cattlewomen that indi- cates the various cuts of meat on a carcass, complete with cooking instructions and times. According to ranchers, male dominance flourishes on the family ranches. Don Kennedy acknowledged that there are more women in the business nowadays but went on to describe a problem he had with a woman who had come to clip his cattle. He admitted being a sexist, "even when he began to understand it wasn't right." Matthew Webb described ranching as "a tough fraternity"; at the same time, he considers his wife his equal partner. The value of male dominance over women was evident in the formal and infor- mal roles and activities of participants as well. When talking about it, men and women report their comfort with the spe- cialized gender roles and credit them with making the fam- ily ranch work, even though the actual division of labor is not that distinct. Gender relations are evident in the frequent and humorous gender slippage as well. Quite common in conversations, interviews, sales and show brochures, and judges' decisions were jokes regarding the bulls' scrotum circumference and penile length measures or the cows' udder size as key reproductive indicators. The widespread references to male animal dominance function as general- izations of human males' dominance over women, which then naturalizes the assertion, as noted by Haraway (1991). The lives of ranchers tend toward gender egalitarianism as the result of the type of work that needs to be done and who is available to do it. At the show, most men express appreci- ation of the work of women on their family ranches and in show activities. At one of the stock sales, Merle Franklin advised me to watch the women, because "They know what's really going on." The women I spoke with exuded confidence with the importance of their work. Noted Amy Lane, "They couldn't do it without us." Even so, both men and women acknowledged that women are the ones in the background, whereas the men are up front, getting all the credit. Nevertheless, while acknowledging the male domi- nance, men and women ranchers noted that the industry is changing. Several noted that more women are taking on pro- fessional roles to supplement their families' incomes, often in addition to their ranch duties at home. Participation of women in junior and collegiate events has increased dra- matically. For example, T.J. and Claire Anderson's daughter competes on the University of Nebraska cattle judging team, as does George Brochman's. Thus, male dominance among ranchers, similar to Latino machismo (Mirand6 1997), appears to be a matter of tradition and appearance that changes in response to internal domestic and external eco- nomic forces and is often at odds with people's activities. Western meanings and values in relational practices. Western meanings and values are constituted in and through the relational practices of agents at this show as well. Mar- keters enact forms of western culture in conjunction with consumers and boothsellers in negotiating symbolic associ- ations to the mythical place, the Wild West, and the contem- porary beef trade show. By means of commodification processes coded with the substantive meanings and values of freedom, naturalism, competition, and family values, the show both draws from and reinvigorates these themes in contradiction with participants' daily lives. Alone, none of the three groups could accomplish the cultural functions of this show. Implicit in the participation of ranchers, booth- sellers, and consumers is their support of the industry, but in particular ways and toward specific cultural ends. First, attracting a nonranch audience is significant in its cultural functioning. That nonranchers find the show inter- esting and pay to see it says much about the general appeal and currency of the meanings and values conveyed here. Consumers' participation is crucial in helping accomplish the show's festival functioning in celebrating the beef indus- try. It appears that the more consumers' and ranchers' lives depart from these so-called western values, which bear a striking resemblance to mainstream U.S. values, the more spectacular they become in this market festival. The show is 23There is much political irony in the fact that farm policy is skewed in favor of large factory farms, even as it depends on small farms for its social legitimization. These subsidies, largely for grain production, were initiated during the depression to safeguard the food supply. They are beginning to be cut and more closely tied to market conditions, though they continue to be made when the market is strong as incentives for farmers not to produce (Hebert 1996). Most recently, distinctions between the ways small and large farms are affected by government agricultural programs has become a priority of U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman (McClain 1997), and payments channeled from the U.S. Depart- ment of Agriculture resource conservation funds have been made to preserve small ranches (Blevins 1998). The practice maintains open space but does nothing to foster these businesses within the logic of the market. 102 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="22">a cultural space keeping alive important traditions and val- ues associated with the past developments of this country, traditions that are rendered obsolete by the very population growth and urban development that most visitors here are a part of and strive to leave behind, if only for a short time. Second, the mix of business activities with education and entertainment here is significant in creating a hospitable learning environment for the industry. The combination occurs at many levels and for visitors and participants alike in the marketing strategies designed to promote the show and all of its events: the breed shows and auction sales with their ani- mal husbandry, showing techniques, and sexual humor; exhibitors' booth merchandising; and the spectacular drama of the rodeo. This mingling of business, education, and enter- tainment creates meanings, even as it refuses others, by means of the repetition of proindustry themes and the absence of contradictory messages.24 Rendering complex industry practices and dangerous animal-human interactions humor- ous and entertaining is key to the cultural functioning of the show in promoting and socially validating animal production. Furthermore, the blend of information, business, and enter- tainment in the festival format effectively places ranchers' production activities in the familiar context of a consumption event. Thus, the format renders the show well suited to com- municating proindustry perspectives and information. Third, invoking its historical tradition is key to the meaning making at this show. Throughout the show are ref- erences to the past-to the Old West specifically. The abun- dance of historical references lends cultural authority to the show and its activities. The show has rightful claim to a 100- year tradition, during which the beef industry has played a significant role in the western expansion of the nation. Ref- erences to the past are pervasive in the activities; the testi- mony of ranchers, boothsellers, and consumers; the names of the cattle; the many businesses represented in the booths; and the explanations of the rodeo events and entertainment. Historical references strategically legitimate the industry as well, acting in a public relations function by putting forth the past importance of the industry to the nation as the basis for the continued rightful place of animal production in con- temporary society. Independent, small ranchers and farmers are emphasized, even though the industry is dominated by large commercial agribusiness enterprises. In this sense, the historical heritage conveyed at the show is nostalgic in invoking and reenergizing myths of the West held by ranch- ers and nonranchers. Finally, the use of business practices as the basis for claims of authenticity is key to the cultural functioning of the show. Authenticity is a quality heavily disputed in its characteristics and not well understood in its market manifestations. Philoso- phers and other scholars disagree on whether it is more appro- priately located in the subjective realm of the senses or as an objective, material quality (Price and Amould 1992). Ques- tions of authenticity in the marketplace often rest on the essen- tially indeterminate interplay of perceptions and invocations of the imaginary and the real in marketing construction and consumer response (Scott 1993; Stern 1992). More important, combinations of the imaginary and real are crucial to the cul- tural functions of the show. Without the romance of the Wild West, the more technical, economic aspects of the show could not sustain its spectacle for consumers. Given most visitors' and many ranchers' basic discomfort with the mass production of animals, the rodeo plays an important role in preserving the wild at this show and, in doing so, helps justify the acceptance of animal domestication that is the basis of the industry prac- tices celebrated here. Just as important, the rituals of animal domestication, largely at the stock shows and rodeo but also in the merchandise booths, may well facilitate visitors' ability to attend the show and enhance its appeal to them as a collective contemporary celebration of agricultural abundance. Production of the West in Agents' Discourse and Practice Outcomes of western market culture include reproduction of cultural meanings and values, industry development and embodiment, inverted cultural representations, and cultural legitimization of the beef industry. These outcomes are put for- ward as the effects of marketers' cultural production processes at the show in conjunction with other agents (see Figure 1). Reproduction of cultural meanings and values. Funda- mental to the National Western Stock Show is business. Although the show retains its economic role, its primary effects are increasingly cultural. This research demonstrates that western culture is a complex dynamic constituted in the interactions and discourses of multiple agents that converge in this marketplace. Ranchers' performances for one another in buying and selling cattle are just as important to the beef indus- try as the social relations they construct and maintain with vis- itors. This is especially true as the industry transforms into more rationalized and competitive large-scale agribusiness. Industry development/embodiment. On the one hand, the authenticity of the show remains virtually indisputable, stem- ming from the ranch business consummated here. On the other hand, because it is so consciously and blatantly an industry- sponsored publicity extravaganza tied to the Old West, its 24Opposition to the show was minimal. Every year a small demonstration is held by vegetarians and animal rights activists denouncing the show. Inside, one of the few markers in response to outside dissent was an antivegetarian bumper sticker, "Tofu free '93," displayed prominently at a bookstore booth. Breed associa- tion newsletters include the claims of opponents and the counter- claims of industry leaders. Regarding concerns that land is rapidly being cleared in third-world countries for cattle raising, the responses were that cattle production is demand driven and that cattle actually help the environment by breaking up seeds with their hooves and aiding the growth of grass. This latter assertion is based on Savory's (1988) controversial study of the African plains, which is distinct from the fenced-in conditions of most land grazed by cattle in the United States. Regarding concerns that 75% of the corn grown in this country is wasted on livestock production, the response was that most grain produced in the United States is unsuitable for human consumption. Concerns about ground water pollution due to the high ammonia content of cattle and pig urine were countered with an emphasis on the custodial role of ranchers; that is, because they depend on the land for their livelihood, they take good care of it. Ranchers report trends toward more environ- mental stewardship, including pasture rotation and concerted efforts to better match the numbers of cattle to the holding capa- bility of the land. Even so, they acknowledge continued problems of land erosion, degradation, and ground water pollution related to livestock production in the West. Commodification of the American West / 103</page><page sequence="23">authenticity is not without reproach. Paradoxically, then, the livestock business that is the very purpose of the show in its relevance to meat production is only partially the basis of its authenticity. Marketers' and consumers' efforts in sustaining western meanings and values through their imaginative and physical participation in the reproduction of the Wild West are critical to the development and embodiment of the industry. Inverted cultural representations. Marketers' commodifi- cation of the West is accomplished through the actual con- duct of business and the way this industry is represented. Paradoxically, although the industry has advanced signifi- cantly by modernizing through the use of sophisticated, sci- entific animal husbandry technologies such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer, the themes celebrated at the show retain important elements of the romanticized, Wild West past. That is, for each of the thematic elements, one is privileged over the other: freedom over social constraint, market autonomy over cutthroat competition, naturalism over animal domestication, and family values over male dominance. Notably, the themes expressed here are less from the past than from their contemporary representation and reproduction in market artifacts and activities in relation to market agents' imaginings and remembrances of the past. Cultural legitimization of the beef industry. Recalling that one of the foundational roles of culture is to reconcile life's contradictions is important in appreciating how these inversions of western cultural life legitimize the beef indus- try for ranchers and consumers. For ranchers, animal pro- duction has evolved over time into a bizarre mix of business edicts and life management. The dual and, at times, contra- dictory cultural and economic pulls of the market are expe- rienced by ranchers in each of the inversions detailed previ- ously. Visitors are implicated in the life contradictions present at the show as well. A major paradox of this show lies in the way it eclipses cattle consumption, even as pro- duction is a big part of this spectacle. Visitors attribute their fascination with the show primarily to the presence of live animals, for the most part leaving unacknowledged their roles as consumers, even as these roles are crucial to the industry and to the show's cultural functioning. The recog- nition that visitors are implicated in this show as beef con- sumers elevates them from the external position of naive outsider to one of privileged insider. They are, as ranchers themselves note, ranchers' very reason for being. Signifi- cantly, the participation of so many visitors at this show lends it authenticity as a celebration of the industry. Implications and Conclusions Where is my John Wayne? Where is my prairie son? Where is my happy ending? Where have all the cowboys gone? -Paula Cole, "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?" To hell with the whales; save the cowboy. -Anonymous bumper sticker at the stock show The first theoretical contribution of this research lies in its investigation of marketers' roles in producing culture at the trade show. Cultural studies have made a significant con- tribution to the study of consumer behavior, and there are many contributions to be made in examinations of cultural dimensions of marketer behavior. At this stock show, in par- ticular, marketers maintain an important social function in reproducing specific western cultural values as well as more general capitalistic beliefs. Overall, trade shows advance technological progress and improved quality of life through the specific social institution of business, and each show is tailored to its particular industry sponsor in concert with the region and national cultures within which it is held. For example, Comdex may be seen to articulate cultural themes regarding the future, whereas home shows may serve as valuable negotiations of appropriate lifestyles and standards. Extending the cultural paradigm to study market behav- ior goes beyond merely adding trade shows to the list of pro- motional media with a significant cultural function, how- ever. A related contribution of this work lies in its discussion of the specific discourses and practices through which west- ern cultural meanings and values are produced. Attention is directed to the culturally productive properties of multiple agents in relation to one another, as a nexus of activities and discourses that constitute the marketplace and the larger cul- tural world (see Figure 2). Regionality is a key factor distinguishing marketers' cul- tural production at the show. Despite modernist insistence on people's independence from the natural world, regional dis- tinctions in cattle production forge the nature and character of the cultural discourses and activities enacted here. That physical places have cultural effects has been investigated under the rubric of situational influences on consumer behav- ior (Belk 1975) and the marketing of cities (Kotler 1993) and the service environment (Sherry 1998) for enhanced eco- nomic development. My research contributes to this existing work with attention to the physical marketplace as the nego- tiation of particular cultural formations linked to regional industrial production, terrain, and social relations. The second theoretical contribution of this work is found in its attention to industry as a cultural agent. This research posits a central, formative place for the beef industry in U.S. culture. The industry's cultural potency is demonstrated in this annual celebration of its rich traditions in the breed association activities, the drama of the rodeo and other entertainment, and the many and varied invocations of the industry's historical and mythical past. Here, western mar- ket culture is based on production activities and shaped by industry values, even as both rely symbolically on western traditions for their cultural appeals. This research expands the theoretical understanding of the cultural role of marketing practices by attending to the cultural role of production. This entails an important socio- cultural extension to the foundational consumer-marketer exchange paradigm (Bagozzi 1975). In a twist of modernist specialization and fragmentation, producers and production have served as hidden referents in marketing. By far the majority of our attention has been directed to marketing exchanges between marketers and consumers, with the exception of some work on negotiations between producers and advertising agencies (Lien 1997; Miller 1997) and the hybrid area of services marketing (Price, Arnould, and Tier- 104 / Journal of Marketing, October 2000</page><page sequence="24">ney 1995). Because producers and marketers are inseparable in the beef industry, despite its specialization, I am able to examine interactions between producer/marketers and con- sumers at this show. The third theoretical contribution of this research is its expansion of the use of history beyond a research method to a source of market value. Although attention to historical phenomena is invaluable in shedding light on contemporary market behavior by allowing comparisons with the past (Fullerton 1988; Savitt 1980), it provides a vibrant wealth of potent market meanings as well. This research demonstrates how cultural discourses regarding the West are produced in day-to-day production and marketing activities by drawing on and reproducing its historical tradition and adapting it over time to a changing production and consumption base. In its attention to agricultural marketing, this work enables a reflection on the history of the marketing discipline as well. This field began as agricultural economics at the turn of this century and emphasized production and distribution efficien- cies in building the mass market (Bartels 1965). Although these topics remain important, added to the formula of firm survival are skills in developing the cultural dimensions of market activity. More important, the critical marketing per- spective retains a central interest in marketers' activities, while giving attention to the ways in which these activities are imbued with cultural meanings and ideological effects. Lim- erick, Milner, and Rankin (1991) note the effects of the selec- tive rendering of western history in eclipsing the awareness of the imperialist motives of the nation in its western expansion. At the National Western, marketers' strategic use of the past functions ideologically as well. References to genealogy accomplish culturally authoritative effects in legitimating the present activities of ranchers toward their cattle, the environ- ment, and consumers by eclipsing the industry's large firm and mass production orientation and emphasizing instead the activities and values of small, independent ranchers. The final theoretical contribution of this work stems from its use of a critical marketing perspective in examining the lived effects of market practices on marketers. Of central importance are the social and historical contexts of mar- keters' activities. At the National Western, western cultural values are produced in different ways and toward substan- tively different ends for the ranchers, consumers, and booth exhibitors. Overall, that archetypal cowboy is quite at odds with much of what goes on at the show and in the business. Multiple and contradictory aspects of western marketing culture appear beyond reconciliation. While the ranchers relish their independence and self-sufficiency and love the land and their animals, their way of life is endangered as they strive to keep up with modern industry developments. Their very means of survival depend on their success in the two submarkets-breeders on other breeders and commer- cial producers on feeders, packers, and suppliers; on con- sumer tastes; and on government programs. Still, romantic images of the cowboy and rugged western themes of free- dom, naturalism, competition, and family values persevere. Commerce was identified by ranchers as a factor that takes the soul out of ranching for them, though in my analy- sis, I note that it is a site for the production of profound cul- tural meanings. Consumers are not the only ones dreaming of riding into the sunset, as imagination plays a strong role in fueling the activities of the ranchers and boothsellers as well. It is more than coincidental that the stock show and rodeo effectively use imagery of the Wild West to celebrate the domestication of animals. Today most people in this nation are domesticated into increasingly rationalized jobs and consumer roles. Just as the West as it appears at the show is the antithesis of ranchers' daily activities, so too it is the antithesis of consumers' daily lives. These contradictions convey much about the cultural capabilities of the marketplace. This trade show commemo- rates western meanings and values perhaps even more impor- tantly now than ever, because they are contradicted in the workings of the very same industry credited with their original development in the United States. However, rather than mar- vel at the cultural functions of the show, the importance of cul- tural criteria in economic development (Hefner 1998) should be recognized and its invocation of the past in developing a more humane future put to use. As rancher Steven Gatlin put it, "The market truly doesn't care that it's someone's living." Although this is true, people constitute markets, and integral to their function are powerful cultural drives and desires. Marketing theorists and practitioners are advised to take careful note of the ways markets evolve and specialize his- torically and pay attention to gleaning their positive features and derailing negative ones. Much can be learned from the work of scholars who study the impact of economic organi- zation on cultural life. Weber (1978) raises concerns regard- ing the tendencies of people in bureaucratic organizations to lose sight of their original purpose in the efficiency and effectiveness with which they perpetuate themselves. Bell (1976) examines the way the modern economy renders tra- ditional cultural practices obsolete by replacing them with commercial and material values more consistent with a highly rational production system than a humanistic, envi- ronmentally sustainable way of life. Markets, too, demon- strate bureaucratic specialization with negative and positive economic and cultural effects (Amin 1994). Over time, the National Western has become an institu- tional mechanism separating the concerns of producers of breed animals from those of producers of commercial cat- tle. In the data, tensions abound between commercial and breed producers. Commercial producers criticize the breed- ers for not responding to their needs, which stem from the demands of packers and consumers; rather, in promoting themselves and their breeding programs, breeders empha- size aesthetic show characteristics. In turn, breeders assert that they are responding to their market-the market for purebred cattle that ultimately is geared to pleasing con- sumers by helping breed producers preserve distinct quali- ties of the breeds and build more perfect animals. Yet rather than maintain unreflectively the myopia of their specialized activities, there is a need to coordinate the activities of these specialized submarkets to yield the cross-fertilization so important to their respective development as well as that of the industry overall. Reviewing the data, I find evidence in support of both positions. There is a relationship between breed and com- Commodification of the American West / 105</page><page sequence="25">mercial markets, yet they are relatively autonomous,25 and mixed effects accrue to various industry participants. At the show, breed production, not meat production, is the primary source of market status and value, yet there are closer links between breed and commercial production than many com- mercial producers acknowledge. Such characteristics as birth weight, weight gain per day, and frame size are care- fully managed by breed producers, and they are of relevance to commercial producers. At the same time, commercial cat- tle production has strayed from consumers' concerns as well because of the difficulties in coordinating its many channel agents (cow/calf operations, feedlots, and packers) and the priority that is given to production concerns, such as unifor- mity of size and weight gain efficiency, over marbling and product taste. More important, even as some ranchers find that master- ing the edicts of economic efficiency is crucial to their suc- cess, many others find it increasingly difficult to survive in this way. The time has come in agriculture to reroute efforts solely aimed at stemming production costs to include those in building value by supplementing the modernist economic strategies of production and distribution efficiency with the postmodern marketing strategies of producing cultural meanings (Brown 1995; Firat and Venkatesh 1995). The marketing strategy of providing cultural meanings to con- sumers has reinvigorated economically distressed areas (Bailey 1991; Long, Clark, and Liston 1994). It is a mainstay of innumerable consumer products and services markets in the United States and abroad, such as fast food (Watson 1997), theme parks (Project on Disney 1997), and retail clothing (Pefialoza 1999; Sherry 1998), and as such offers tremendous potential for beef marketing. Western culture is an excellent place to begin, because its themes resonate so deeply with people in the United States and abroad. Cultural meanings relevant to the beef industry are found in the blend of progress and tradition that visitors and ranchers value at the show. However, too much modernism is not appreciated, as elements of mass production (e.g., chemi- cal hormones, pesticides) are not considered healthy by many consumers and ranchers. In contrast, western meanings and values carry a host of positive meanings. Promising sources of meaning in developing market value and beef niche markets include regional sites of production, particular breeds, ranch history, and owner personality, as well as organic production processes, such as those developed by Marie Griswold in Canada and the Coleman family in Colorado (Voynick 1998). The marketing effort may be conducted by individual ranch- ers, though given the plethora of small producers, umbrella organizations such as the breed associations, regional organi- zations of cattle producers, and community co-ops make more sense. Offering multiple opportunities for producers to partic- ipate in the industry rather than solely as low-cost producers is important for the health of the beef industry overall and is con- sistent with the trends toward the increased importance of mar- keting activities in most other industries constituting today's competitive markets. Implementing new market niches poses great challenges and offers opportunities. Although individual breed and commercial cattle producers and organizations have experi- ence buying and selling cattle, they are less adept at build- ing value, image, and brand meanings. A major obstacle to the industry's use of its past traditions is ranchers' internal- ization of neoclassical economic tenets, namely, the central importance of low-cost production in their activities and organizations, including the host of land grant universities, agricultural extension programs, and junior clubs. Another major obstacle stems from the monopolistic competitive structure of the Big Four (see n. 12) and the market power these packers obtain as a function of their ties with retailers. Yet their lack of marketing innovation due to their profi- ciency under the existing system is a key weakness. Reeval- uating the structure and activities of the Beef Council is another important task, and attention must be given to its representation of beef producers, both small and large, and the various submarket concerns of commercial ranchers and breeders. In taking more initiative in marketing their cattle and adding value through cultural meanings as well as pro- duction and distribution efficiencies, ranchers stake their rightful claim to a more autonomous place in an increas- ingly global, competitive market. 25Tensions between commercial and breed producers parallel those between marketing practitioners and academics. The market for theory, similar to the market for purebred cattle, is a subdomain of a larger complex market attributed primarily to practitioners that has evolved as the result of a historically situated and ongoing mar- ket specialization with its own unique ends.
