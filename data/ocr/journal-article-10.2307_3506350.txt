<plain_text><page sequence="1">326 Reviews Savage Ruskin. By PATRICK CONNER. London and New York: Macmillan. I979. xiv + I89 pp. L8.95. Strangely for a book with such a strident headline for a title, it is not an aggressive but a strained Ruskin who emerges from Patrick Conner's study. The object may be, as the author says, to show him as the scourge of academicians and Bradford millionaires alike, yet the implication of a prophet self-assured and single-minded to the point of arrogance, lashing his society, its tastes and morals, with merciless energy, is not borne out by the mixture of commentary, biography, and critical analysis which Dr Conner offers. The study turns more on Ruskin's basic premises and principles, notably his persistent linking of artistic and moral qualities, than on his relations with the Victorian public. It sets out the various angles and conse- quences of this sometimes violent yoking together, tracing the movement of Ruskin's logic from the connexions he saw between the individual artist's character and his creations, through the social inferences to be drawn from architectural style (was the carver happy in his work ?), to his ultimate shift from the indirect to the direct interpretation of society's maladies and sins. Dr Conner handles these issues succinctly, if sometimes in too summary a way, and his familiarity with the context of art and architectural criticism in the I83os and I 84os from which Ruskin developed his own extremely idiosyncratic approach is one of the most useful aspects of the book. His discussion of the readiness to apply the concept of 'expres- sion' to buildings as well as to faces in pictures, together with the general tendency to anthropomorphism in the age's critical and creative life, is particularly sugges- tive, though from a literary point of view the brief allusion to Dickens in this con- text is disappointingly superficial. Dr Conner maintains that Ruskin's life story is indispensable if his aesthetic and moral ideas and the ensuing social judgements are to be properly understood. This may to a point be so, but the biographical account provided is merely a routine outline of familiar facts and circumstances, which does not work very effectively to justify the claim. Indeed these sections of the book tend to reduce its status to that of an introductory survey instead of the critically stimulating study promised in its best areas of research into Victorian approaches to the arts. And no Punch lampoon of a savage Ruskin can withstand the pathos of his personal history, with its testi- mony to the vulnerable, often bewildered, painfully disillusioned man who found that noble art had little to do with noble character, that England refused to join St George's Guild, and who, finally, was tormented by the black storm wind. Dr Conner therefore distracts attention in this biographical way, too, from his avowed focus on Ruskin's public impact. Angry dialogues between Ruskin and his audience did of course occur, and both the nature of his rhetorical tactics and the response to his often extravagant views need more scrutiny, but this is not the study to supply it or even to open up the topic very far, despite its intentions. On the other hand, it does not diminish the stature or the fascination of Ruskin as a crucial presence in his age, albeit one whose fury is less central than his indomitable struggle to drive society's rocking chariot with his unruly team of art harnessed to morals.

The editor of this collection of essays asserts in the first sentence of her preface that it 'is designed to present a specifically Anglo-American view of Melville'.
