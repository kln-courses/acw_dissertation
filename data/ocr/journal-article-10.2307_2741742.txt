The main controversy is that between the psychoanalytic school, which asserts that we cannot help attributing certain meanings to at least some symbols, and the structuralist school, which stresses the arbitrariness of all symbols, Sperber (1975:84) even speak- ing of "the absurd idea that symbols mean." According to Freud (1962[1900]:359), "imagination does not admit of long stiff objects and weapons as symbols of the female genitals or of hollow objects, such as chests, cases, boxes etc. being used as symbols for the male ones." Jung (1964:67) is equally convinced of the inborn quality of certain symbolic representations, although he defines his archetypes not as ready-made images, but as the consequences of an instinctive tendency to represent for ourselves certain motives. Fromm (1962 [1951]:20, 24) echoes Jung's view of symbols as cultural heritage; for him they are even "humanity's forgotten language." While conceding that the particular meaning of a symbol can only be determined through its global context, he nevertheless speaks of universal symbols rooted in the experience of every human being. I wish to refute this rigidly deterministic idea. In my opinion, the only true mental universals are to be found in language and in the related field of kinship systems and terminology. Even GABRIELLA EICHINGER FERRO-LuzzI is an unofficial research worker at the Institute of Anthropology of the University of Rome and a teacher of Tamil in the university's Institute of Linguistics (mailing address: Via Mario Fascetti, 67, 00136 Roma, Italy). Born in 1931, she was educated at the University of Mainz (diplo- ma in modern languages, 1954) and at the University of Rome (doctorate in geography [thesis in anthropology], 1968). She has traveled extensively and has done anthropological fieldwork in India. Her research interests are culture-specific and culture-free attitudes towards foods, purity and pollution, Hindi ritual and mythology, and Hindu culture as seen through modern Tamil literature. Her publications include "Women's Pollution Periods in Tamilnad (India)" (Anthropos 69:113-61); "Temporary Fe- male Food Avoidances in Tamilnad: Interpretations and Paral- lels" (East and West 25:471-85); "The Logic of South Indian Food Offerings" (Anthropos 72:529-56); "Ritual as Language: The Case of South Indian Food Offerings" (CA 18:507-14); and "The Foods Disliked by the Gods in South India" (Annali dell'- Istituto Orientale di Napoli 37:357-73). The present paper was submitted in final form 11 x 78. there, however, determinism is rarely absolute; some theoretical possibilities are ruled out, but a few alternatives remain, and most linguistic universals are, in fact, implicational.1 Rather than postulating an innate drive to choose certain symbols and to endow them with a certain kind of meaning as many psycho- analysts do, I should like to make a case for an element of caprice in the use of symbols. In order to explain simulta- neously the frequency of some symbolic meanings and the lack of true mental constraints, I propose the similes of "highways" and "scenic routes" of symbolic thought in our brains. Most of us will take advantage of the "highways"-will choose certain objects as symbols and preferentially attribute certain mean- ings to these symbols. Apart from the fact, however, that nothing obliges us to travel along any "route" of symbolic thought-we may see an object simply as what it is, without attaching any symbolic meaning to it-we always have the possibility of avoiding the "highway" and taking a "scenic route." There are, of course, innumerable "scenic routes," some public and some private, leading in directions totally different from that of the "highway." Among these it is the special case of the "scenic opposite route," offering unexpected and exciting views, which forms the main subject of this study. For the structuralist, my argument of interchangeable sym- bols may seem to force open doors. According to the structuralist school of thought, symbols acquire their meanings only in the context of a myth, a rite, a social setting, etc. I do not deny that context is important for the interpretation of symbols, and in some of the examples given below the meaning of the symbol does indeed change with the context. In other cases, however, context is irrelevant; the symbol may have the same meaning in different contexts and different meanings in the same context. This statement may also seem commonplace, since Levi-Strauss (1971:564) has established that inverted myths may have identical meanings and identical myths may have inverted meanings. Mythological reversals in the structural sense, how- ever, are always reversals of correlations, while in the case of the Hindu symbols I am dealing with it is the meaning of the individual element which is inverted, without entailing the inversion of the whole context. Perhaps the word "context" 1 For example, any language that has a dual inflectional category has a plural inflectional category, but not necessarily vice versa (Greenberg 1968:140). There remains the choice between having a dual inflectional category and not having one. Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980</page><page sequence="2">needs an explanation. Though different in form, ritual and legend may be statements about the same deity, and it is therefore not surprising if the symbol of that deity is the same in both cases. When, however, in ritual and legend a white- anthill may be either Sivalifigam or a goddess, or when in two otherwise identical versions of a temple legend the lotus may be either identical with the IiAgam2 or opposed to it like the yoni, the largely context-free interchangeability of male and female symbols will become clear. The interchangeable symbols of Hindu gods and goddesses to be discussed are derived from various ritual contexts and from temple legends. These legends pursue the purpose of explaining why a temple was built on a certain spot-usually because of the miraculous discovery of the idol-and/or of justifying the unorthodox shape of the idol. Complete analysis of this large body of temple legends is beyond the scope of this paper; here I shall cite only those cases which illustrate the "scenic opposite route" of symbolic thought, the paradoxical interchange of male and female symbols, against the background of the "highways" of symbolic association which confirm psychoana- lytic views. It will be noted that, paradoxically, I shall mention more examples confirming Freudian theory than contradicting it, but there is good reason for doing so. The wider and more crowded the "highway," the more striking the "scenic opposite route," hence the usefulness of clearly tracing the former. The material will be grouped in a scale of roughly increasing conceptual difficulty. While almost all the cases discussed contradict Freud's categorical affirmations, the examples at the beginning of the exposition show "scenic opposite routes" on which traffic is still fairly dense in India and elsewhere. In the last few examples, the "scenic opposite route" becomes narrow and steep; perhaps only Hindus, and even among them the exceptional few, will venture the excursion. Some interchanges of male and female symbolic meanings seem to be due to a totally arbitrary use of binary opposites. Others apparently correspond to one of the following: (1) dif- ferent characteristics of the same object are selected, evoking either a male or a female association; (2) the same characteristic may be seen from different perspectives; (3) the male/female opposition may vanish in a common denominator at a higher level of abstraction. What stands out in this contextual neu- tralization (as linguists would call it) is that not only may the male category (in this case the symbol normally evoking a male association) be extended to include a female meaning, but also the symbol normally evoking a female association may come to have a male meaning. Since polysemy and condensation of meanings have been adduced as definitions of symbolism (Turner 1967:28, 51), it is no wonder that polar symbols, fusing binary opposites, exist. In Hindu symbolism, Ardhandrisvara, the hermaphrodite, im- mediately comes to mind. The iconographic fusion of male and female aspects, of Siva and Sakti, is of great interest as an expression of a deep human aspiration for wholeness apparent in myth and ritual all over the world. Baumann (1955) has dedicated a voluminous monograph to bisexually conceived deities, souls, etc., and I do not intend to add to the literature on the subject. I would only note that in India the fusion of male and female aspects in one deity is not limited to iconog- raphy, but also appears in linguistic symbols. Siva may be spoken of as Ammaiyappar ("mother-father"), a sort of verbal Ardhandr!svara with inverted signs. This fusion of male and female aspects under the female sign obviously belongs to bhakti (devotional) religion, in which the protecting, motherly qualities of the god are emphasized. A further semantic fusion of god and goddess sometimes occurs in the names of Siva and, more frequently, in those of Visnu and his avataras. Thus Siva may be known as Minmksisundaresvara, where Minaksi refers to Parvati, the goddess with fish-shaped eyes. Visnu may be called Laksminmrayana (Laksmi being his wife and Narayana an alternative name for the god) and Narasimha, his man-lion avatara, Laksminarasimha. Freud himself has created a bisexual symbol, speaking of the "phallic mother," an alleged product of infantile fantasies (1964[1932-36]:126). In this "phallic moth- er," in Ardhandr!svara and its verbal equivalents, however, there is only fusion and no confusion of male and female elements (just as in real life the sexual chromosomes Y and X remain distinct in the male), whereas I am concerned precisely with such a confusion. Male and female symbols and associa- tions are interchanged with total disregard of Freudian theory and even anatomical distinction. THE TREE Trees are widely venerated in India, both at the popular level of religion and in Sanskritic temples. As the trunk of a tree is usually long and solid, it would seem to be well suited to becoming a Freudian phallic symbol, and trees often do evoke a male association. On the other hand, the selection of a different characteristic or the choice of a different perspective may, albeit less frequently, convert a tree into a female symbol. (Trees, of course, also have several nonsexual associations. Their uprightness, for instance, may call to mind the vertical position of human beings in general as distinct from animals.) A common feature of popular Hinduism is the tree marriage, in which either trees are married to each other or a man or woman is fictitiously married to a particular tree. In these cases, within the category of trees equated with human beings a particular characteristic may be selected to warrant a male or a female association. The latex of a tree is readily likened to milk in India and elsewhere (Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1973b: 262; Turner 1967:20), accounting for a female association of various species of "milk-trees." Latex-exuding Ficus trees figure prominently in Indian ritual and mythology, but more than their latex, their constant renewal through aerial roots may stimulate symbolic thought suggesting such associ- ations as strength, longevity, and fertility. A peepal tree that happens to grow near another, less vigorous species literal- ly englobes it. This tendency of the peepal is artificially en- couraged by planting a peepal tree next to a neem tree so that, when both are fully grown, the latter will be tightly clasped by the former. In the shade of this arboreal couple, suggestive of fertility, snake stones, which also hold a promise of fertility, are erected. What seems to be decisive for seeing a male in the peepal is probably its amorous embrace of the neem and, above all, its more vigorous growth. In Bengal, on the other hand, where banyan and peepal trees are brought into conjunction, the peepal is considered the female, probably again on the basis of the relative vitality of the trees (the growth of the banyan being even more exuberant than that of the peepal). In the above examples, some kind of supernatural quality is attributed to trees, but they are not deities as such. In other cases, trees are more intimately connected with Hindu deities. Siva in his Iingam form is frequently associated and even identi- fied with trees, as the psychoanalyst would have predicted. There are temples in which Siva is worshipped not in the form of a lin'gam but in that of a tree (Census 1971:416; 1964a:114). In a popular version of the classic story of the pine forest, the peepal tree is patently phallic: In order to destroy the super- natural powers certain kings have acquired through their austerities and their wives' chastity, Siva decides to seduce the wives. He takes the form of a peepal tree, which the barren women are advised to embrace. The women immediately con- 2 Following Hindu usage, the term lingam in this paper denotes either the combined lingam-yoni idol or the lingam only. In ritual the liigam worshipped is normally the combined idol, but in some svayambhIailifga (self-born) temples and in mythology the term lintgam may sometimes have its narrow meaning. 46 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Eichlinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM ceive and lose the supernatural powers which have enabled them to make water pots out of sand (Elmore 1913:81). Temple legends also frequently mention trees in connexion with idols of various deities, above all Siva. The Sivalifigam may be discovered because blood oozes out of a tree, which later transforms itself into a svayacmbhiliigam (self-born). In these cases the tree is the alter ego of the linigam. This assertion would seem to call for comment, as transforma- tions in everyday experience as well as in mythology normally presuppose a progression from the initial to the end situation. In the majority of the discovery legends, no transformation occurs. In order to reveal its presence, which might otherwise have gone unnoticed (especially in the case of a svayambhln- linigam indistinguishable from an ordinary stone), the hidden idol may bleed on being hurt. In other, less frequent cases, the god plays a trick on the discoverer and first appears as his double, in the shape of a tree, an anthill, etc. (Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1978). The fact that inanimate elements of nature bleed clearly indicates their supernatural quality; when they later take the form of an idol, this transformation results not in a progression but only in the substitution of one equivalent for another and hence a maintenance of the status quo. In still other versions of the story, the lifigam is found in the ground near or under a tree, which allows for a double perspec- tive: the tree may be equated with the liigam (male) or with the earth (female). When the iffigam is found under a banyan tree or near a peepal tree, the tree may or may not represent its double. When the Iiigam is found under a bamboo or a jasmine creeper, however, they are likely to be considered its opposites, since the hollow bamboo often has a female associa- tion and the creeper encircling the linigam may suggest Parvati embracing the linigam, a common mythological image. When the linigam is found in the hole of a tamarind tree (Census 1968b:322), there is hardly any doubt that the tree is opposed to the linigam as a female symbol, not only because it forms a receptacle, but also because tamarind juice may be equated with menstrual blood (Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1973a:171).3 In the latter examples, a female association of the trees may be induced, and they may indirectly represent Parvatl, even though no goddess is specifically mentioned. Other temple legends, however, establish exactly the same relationship between idol and tree with regard to goddesses as we have seen with regard to Sivalifigam. Laksmi in the shape of a stone may be found under a peepal tree, or Devi in the shape of a molehill may reside near a banyan tree, in which case it remains an open question whether goddess and tree are seen as equivalents or as opposites. When, however, blood oozes out of a tree (species not indicated) and the goddess Killamma appears in a dream to a devotee and announces her desire to be worshipped in the form of a bamboo stick (Census 1964a:160), the bleeding tree obviously is the goddess, in analogy to what has been said above. This latter example, in my opinion, not only contradicts Freudian psychoanalytic theory concerning the tree, but also constitutes a paradox from the structural point of view, since the opposition god/goddess would seem to require opposed symbolic expressions. Trees as interchangeable male and female symbols may not seem particularly exciting. In their case, in fact, the "scenic opposite route" of symbolic thought is still fairly wide, inviting mental travellers from all over the world. THE SNAKE Human attitudes towards snakes are ambivalent in several respects. Snakes are hated and feared hut also worshinned and asked for protection. Snake worship is dictated not only by utilitarian apotropaic considerations, but also by various asso- ciations of ideas evoked by the reptile. Not all associations of the snake are sexual. The sloughing off of its skin may suggest its power to heal skin disease or even make it a symbol of death and rebirth; its undulating movement may recall waves and may connect it with rain and vegetal fertility; its chthonic habits may make it the guardian and bestower of treasures or link it to the realm of death. Its association with sex and human fertility, however, appears to loom largest all over the world. For Freud the snake is always a phallic symbol (1962[1900]: 357), but anthropologists and archeologists know well that it may also be a female one. The ambivalent male/female associations of the snake are easily explained. If its shape, movement, and the fact that it lives in holes in the ground are considered, it tends to become a phallic symbol. The latter habit, however, may also be viewed from a different angle. The snake, living in the earth, may be seen not as opposed to the earth, but as its representative, and hence tends to become a female symbol. Worldwide, I believe, the phallic symbolism of the snake is more frequent than its female one, perhaps because its various male associations are reinforced by the image of the snake bite, suggestive of the perils of sex. In India the cobra is the prototype of the snake category. Cobras and snakes in general are worshipped for apotropaic purposes, as protectors of home and hearth, as healers of skin disease, and above all for the benefit of human fertility. The most widely known snake deity is Nagaraja, the king of snakes, but in Bengal people commonly venerate the snake goddess Manasa. Mythology tells not only of snake kings, but of snake princesses, known for their beauty, who usually marry human kings and give rise to semidivine dynasties. As in the rest of the world, in India the male aspect of the snake dominates. Apart from being a deity in its own right, the snake also appears as an adjunct or representative of gods and goddesses, in par- ticular of Siva. The legend of Neelakanteswara temple, Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh, for instance, mentions that a snake changed into a linigam (Census 1964d:148), and in iconography the liingam often has its snake double coiled around its base and spreading its hood over it. In Sri Thiyagarajaswamy temple, Madras, the linigam is even serpent-shaped (Census 1965:64). The same primarily phallic symbolism can be inferred from the major Indian festival of the snake, Nagapaficami, which is typically a woman's festival, with fertility connotations and erotic overtones. Thus, clearly, the "highway" of symbolic thought considers the snake to be male, and only the "scenic opposite route" leads to a female image. One way of arriving at a female association is through an arbitrary shift of perspective. The cobra coiled around the liigam is, then, not considered its double, but explicitly likened to Parvati drinking soma through the mouth of the liigam (O'Flaherty 1973:277). Despite its ambivalent character, how- ever, the snake in India is never viewed as bisexual-in con- trast, for instance, to its description in Azande mythology, in which the lower part of the "rainbow snake" is female and the upper male (Baumann 1955:248). The Indian snake is equated with a god or a goddess or is itself a god or a goddess for different worshippers in different parts of the country and even for the same speaker in different contexts. A Tamil film illus- trates this interesting double perspective. In Enkal kulateyvam (Our Family God), a cobra, in its character of a general deity residing in a white-anthill, is spoken of as Nagaraja. The same snake also happens to be a household deity, and in this context it is called tdy ("mother"). Similarly, a prize-winning Tamil student, when asked to write about herself, starts by saying that she was born at Nagercoil, the capital of Kanyakumari district, where Nagaramman ("mother snake") resides (Ananda I For a similar association of a red sap with menstruation, see Tur- ner (1967:28). Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980 47</page><page sequence="4">Vikatan, January 17, 1971), even though she knows perfectly well that the famous temple of Nagercoil, which gives its name to the town, is dedicated to the king of snakes, Nagaraja. Here opposite perspectives happily coexist; the cobra as the lord of all people is awesome and male, but as a family deity it is like a mother and hence female. THE WHITE-ANTHILL The white-anthill is practically synonymous with the snake in India, and like the snake it may be a male or a female symbol. Again a double perspective seems to be responsible for its contradictory symbolism. Considering its vaguely conical shape, the white-anthill may be likened to a Sivalifigam, sometimes with pronounced phallic connotation. Unequivocal testimony in this regard comes from an oral tale recorded by Sontheimer (1976:131): Some women go to worship a white-anthill on Nagapaficami day. One of them, on seeing a couple of cobras, warns the others not, as one might expect, of the dangerous poisonous snakes, but of the anthill, exclaiming, "The anthill is a man, keep away from him!"4 The male association of the white-anthill is thus guided by its outer contour, making it an equivalent of the linigam-as for instance in Sri Sivaloganathaswamy temple, where the svayambh9ili'ngam is in the form of a white-anthill (Census 1971:21)-and the phallic snake. Conversely, the much rarer female association looks at the anthill from inside, so to speak. Its cavities, considered to be the favourite abode of snakes, are opposed to it and hence female. This second, more compli- cated way of analogical reasoning leading to a female meaning, however, seems to lie at the back of people's symbolic mind. The anthill is never explicitly likened to the yoni holding the snake-li'ngam, to my knowledge. Either it is entirely male and equated with its male content-the snake alias linigam or some male person-or it is entirely female and equated with its female content, a goddess. The legend of Sri Bhagavathiamman temple, Kanyakumari district, Tamilnad, illustrates the latter case: A boy hits an anthill and blood oozes out, whereupon an astrologer ordains that it be considered the image of the goddess Bhagavati. It is now fenced, thatched, and worshipped as the goddess (Census 1968b:54). The "scenic opposite route" of symbolic thought which attributes to the anthill a female meaning, equating it with an anthropomorphic goddess, may even reflect on its theriomorphic divine inhabitant or vice versa. In Madras, for instance, a huge anthill symbolizes Nagamman ("mother snake") (Gopalakrishnan 1953:98). THE LOTUS Unlike trees, snakes, and anthills, for which the "highways" of symbolic thought lead to a male image, the lotus flower is predominantly female and only exceptionally male. The su- preme beauty of the flower doubtless accounts for its outstand- ing role in Hindu and Buddhist iconography and mythology. The associations evoked by the lotus go far beyond the mere male/female dichotomy. Its petals, which close in the evening and open again in the morning, make it an appropriate religious symbol of death and rebirth. Also, the beauty of any divine or human being may be described by speaking of his or her lotus-eyes, lotus-mouth, or lotus-hands, and reverence may be expressed by touching a deity's or a person's lotus-feet. When a sexual distinction is relevant, however, the lotus most com- monly appears in a female context. The fact that it grows in water makes it representative of water, itself a predominantly female symbol. The Hindu deity most consistently symbolized by the lotus is Laksmi, the god- dess of happiness and wealth. Not only does she stand on a lotus pedestal, but one and even two of her hands may hold lotus flowers. In one legend she even substitutes one of her breasts for a lotus bud needed in worshipping Siva (Gupta 1971:21). Siva temple legends tell of the discovery of the linigam hidden under a lotus growing in a tank. Here ob- viously the lotus is opposed to the lin'gam and equated with water and the yoni. Otherwise identical legends, however, invert the symbolic meaning of the lotus. Then the discovery occurs because a bleeding lotus becomes the linigam (Census 1965:10-11) or because the lingam in the form of an arrow is discovered in a bleeding lotus (Census 1966:329). In the former case the lotus is the linigam, while in the latter it may or may not be its redundant double. The legend of the Buddhist Svayambhunath temple near Katmandu echoes this Siva story (in this Nepalese temple, numerous ritual and mythological connexions occur between Buddha and Siva, starting from the name Svayambhui, now normally referring to Siva) and uses the lotus symbol with the same unorthodox male meaning. The primordial Buddha is said to have appeared in the form of a flame (another typical alter ego of Siva) in a lotus. The sacred spring or the hole in which the root of the lotus flower lies is worshipped as the goddess Guhe&amp;vari. Just as in the above Saiva example the lotus is assimilated to its contents, the linigam, so here it is to the flame. Nepali (1965:331), who mentions the legend, in fact also equates it with a linigam. The triad linigam-lotus-water is exactly parallel to the one found in the legends telling of a linigam discovered in the ground near a tree. If we take the linigam and the earth or the linigam and water as binary opposites, the plant is the third element, which may or may not be present. Superficially it looks like a mediator, but in fact it does not mediate, perhaps because there is no contradiction to be resolved in such simple stories, not dealing with ultimate concerns. The third element rather is a redundant addition, which mostly duplicates its normal psychological equivalent (the tree the linigam and the lotus water or the yoni). In rare cases, however, the dominant asso- ciation is disregarded. It might, of course, be argued that at a higher taxonomic level the lotus is a symbol of divinity par excellence and may thus stand for any god or goddess, as indeed it does. In the context of the temple legends, however, the lotus-linigam seems to be primarily the result of a completely arbitrary reduction of a triad to a dyad. THE POINTED WEAPON According to Freud, the imagination does not admit of weapons' being conceived as female symbols. Fischer (1963:245), inter- preting Fromm, asserts that metal weapons, because of their character and use, once introduced would automatically receive an aggressive, phallic symbolic meaning. Again I do not deny that this is mostly true, but I want to refute the view which confuses a statistically greater frequency with an absolute psychological law. Weapons are prominent in Hindu iconography and figure in the multiple hands of many deities. Not every such weapon characterizes the holder. Some weapons and other objects are held by more than one deity, and only the combination of all emblems allows an unambiguous identification of its owner. Some weapons and other objects, however, have become the symbols of deities; for instance, the lance stands for the god Murukan, for whom Vel ("lance") is an alternative name. Apart from any phallic connotation, in the division of labour between 4 I wonder what Indian symbolic thought might have been if there were African termites, which build much higher and strikingly lifigam-like hills, in India, since the irregularly shaped and often rather squat construction of the Indian termites is sufficient to evoke the image of a lingam. 48 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM the sexes the destruction of life through the use of weapons is normally the domain of man. The traditional incompatibility between weapon and woman, however, applies only to the human sphere. Goddesses in India and other parts of the world may be just as warlike as their male counterparts. This is perhaps one of the reasons that not only gods are depicted holding weapons in their hands and that weapons may become symbols of goddesses, but it is not the whole explanation. If it were, a weapon could only become the symbol of warlike, life- destroying goddesses, which of course many Hindu goddesses are. There is no indication, however, that this is the main criterion in choosing the symbol, nor is the weapon symbol abandoned when, as now increasingly happens, the goddess becomes benign. The trident is a symbol that recurs in different periods and in different parts of the world, as d'Alviella has pointed out (1956[1894]: 237-60). Whatever its psychoanalytic meaning may be-Freud (1962[1900]:358) says that "the number three has been confirmed from many sides as a symbol of the male genitals" -it is normally found in the hands of male supernaturals like the Assyrian god of air and storm, Poseidon, Siva, and the devil. Many demons are stabbed to death by Siva with his tri?da, and this weapon is so strongly associated with the god that he may be shown holding a tri?sula even when endowed with only two hands. A trisula carried by a mendicant imme- diately identifies him as a devotee of Siva (apart from sectarian marks and other characteristic attire). In Tamilnad, a village shrine containing a trisuzla in the place of an idol is often dedicated to the godling Munimvara or (and this may surprise Freudian psychoanalysts) to one of various village goddesses. If the trigiila appears in the hands of Durga, the explanation may be that, since she is Siva's violent Sakti, fighting demons and ultimately one with him, she may rightfully carry his weapon. The tris'ila, however, also represents village goddesses independent of Siva and Mun!Avara. Here we have no selection of different features or reversal of perspectives; what makes the trisutla a symbol of gods and goddesses alike is a complete abstraction from any sexual association. The trisfula has become a symbol of power and hence may be an attribute of both gods and goddesses. The sword also need not symbolize male deities exclusively. It figures in the hands of numerous gods and goddesses with no specific identifying function, but when it is used as the true symbol of a deity it normally refers to a god. Siva's amorous visit to a village goddess, for instance, may be symbolized by a sword laid across the neck of a pot (Beck 1969:564). Also, the legend of Kotravaleeswara temple, Ramanathapuram district, Tamilnad, equates sword and lin'gam (Census 1969:201): A Pandyan king on a hunting expedition fell asleep in the forest. When he awoke, he saw a hermit fighting with a tiger. Wanting to come to his aid, he reached for his sword but could not find it. After having risked his life in trying to save the rsi (sage) with his bare hands, Tsi and tiger suddenly disappeared. Searching for his sword, he found it by the side of a beautiful lingam, for which he at once had a temple built. Here we have again the same redundance as in the case of the tree-lingam and the lotus-lingam, i.e., the sword duplicates the lingam. So far there is nothing surprising from the psycho- analytic point of view. A legend from Maharashtra, however, inverts the symbolic meaning of the sword. In it the goddess Bhavani appears in dream to Sivaji, a Maharashtrian hero victorious in battle against the Muslims, and informs him that she has embodied herself in his sword so that he may defeat his enemies (Sontheimer 1976:46). Obviously the sword here is equated with the goddess not because it evokes any female association, but because, similar to the trisuila, it has become an abstract symbol of fighting power that may be vested in gods and goddesses alike. The arrow is still another pointed weapon which Freudian psychoanalysts would conceive of only as a male symbol. Again, this is mostly the case, and in the Tamil temple legend men- tioned earlier the linigam appears in the shape of an arrow. Also, in a Keralese temple legend a metal arrow in the trunk of a kanjira tree indicates the presence of Siva (Kerala District Gazetteers 1972:735), in which case probably both the tree and the arrow are symbolic doubles of the liAgam. The Siva PurJi.a, however, freely inverts this common psychological association of the arrow: "Brahma said: ... PTrvati in the form of the vaginal passage and an auspicious arrow shall form as the pedestal wherein the phallus shall be installed" (Kunst and Shastri 1970:1299 para. 37). In this paragraph the arrow- pedestal is clearly associated with the yoni and not with the linigam, as one might expect. No particular logical or analogical reasoning seems to be responsible for this inversion, but the triad lifigam-arrow-yoni is arbitrarily reduced to the dyad lnfgam-yoni. THE VESSEL Vessels, like the other objects and elements of nature mentioned so far, may also stand for themselves and need not acquire any symbolic meaning. Besides, the most common symbolic use of the vessel is certainly nonsexual and lies in the culinary field. When a sex-specific association does arise, however, the "high- way" of symbolic thought leads towards a female image, which Freud would have to be absolute. The female connotation of hollow objects may even appear in language. The Baining of New Ireland, for instance, apparently think in such psycho- analytic categories. They readily spoke of the tape recorder in female terms on the grounds that it was a hollow receptacle (Mainard Scheller, personal communication, 1974). In Hindu iconography and mythology, references to recep- tacles are legion. Best known among them is the yoni, the female principle, forming the base and receptacle of the linigam, the male principle. As to pots, we have already met two in- stances demonstrating their dominant female association: the village goddess in the guise of a pot who is visited by Siva in the guise of a sword and the chaste wives whose miraculous water pots break when they conceive by Siva, the peepal tree. To mention but a few further examples of pots with female associations, the goddess Laksmi, in addition to lotus flowers, has pot emblems, and the sage Agastya is known as "the pot-born," the pot patently representing the womb. A favourite ritual object in many parts of India is the kalaga, a metal vessel filled with water and topped by a coconut surrounded by green mango leaves. It most frequently repre- sents a goddess; SarasvatI, the goddess of learning, for instance, may be worshipped in this form. Commonly used in domestic rites, the kalaga may also stand for the deceased ancestors. Since ancestors include persons of both sexes, the kalasa on these occasions is divested of its specific female association. By extension it may thus become a symbol of any deity, a vessel of divine essence as it were, and therefore may also sometimes stand for a god. Ganapati, for instance, may be worshipped in the form of a pot, in addition to an image or some other aniconic representation of the elephant god. Also Venkatesvara may be symbolized by a kalasa bearing the Vaisnava ndma (sign) (Thurston 1909, vol. 1:241; vol. 3:461), despite the fact that hardly any devotee will lack a printed image of this popular form of Visnu. Even Siva's five heads are sometimes symbolized by pots (Beck 1976:221). As we have seen, the symbolic uses of weapons and vessels are similar in the sense that at a higher level of abstraction their sex-bound associations vanish and they become interchangeable symbols of gods and goddesses. The vessel, however, is the Vol. 21 N No. 1 - February 1980 49</page><page sequence="6">more remarkable because the meaning of an originally female symbol is extended to include the male one. So far we have been talking of man-made objects and ele- ments of nature which have no intrinsic connexion with either sex and may become male or female symbols only by metaphor. The "highway" of symbolic thought clearly exists, but the "(scenic opposite route" contradicting psychoanalytic theory is not devoid of traffic. Now I should like to point out some further cases in which the "scenic route" becomes narrow and steep and traffic consequently much thinner. The connexion, which in rare instances is severed, either is one of metonym rather than metaphor or else disregards the parallel between the sex of an animal and the sex of a deity. THE LINGAM The lingam is the most common symbol of Siva and a symbol at that for which, at first sight, one would least expect a female association. Illiterate villagers may at times be ignorant of its phallic meaning, but the scriptures are quite explicit about it. In myth and legend, its phallic connotation is patent or at least transparent, and the lingam idol-apart from the fact that it rises from the yoni, contrary to the physiological situation- may be sculptured in precise anatomical detail. I do not want to imply that the lingam is only a phallic symbol. A Hindu worshipping the lingam thinks as little of sexual intercourse as a Christian thinks of cannibalism when taking Holy Commu- nion. In worship the lingam is simply the aniconic form of Siva and acts as a sign of the divine presence, as the primary meaning "sign, mark" of the Sanskrit term implies.5 The lingam, however, is not just one of a Hindu deity's numerous symbols, but the most prestigious symbol of one of the most prestigious Hindu gods, and in this quality an exten- sion of its meaning becomes plausible. A bridge may be built between Siva's aniconic and iconic idols by providing the lingam with faces, most commonly five male faces (paFicamuk- halingam). The idol of Pasupatinath temple, Katmandu, goes a step farther and represents the left half of one of its four faces as female, as can be concluded from a more elaborate coiffure and an extended ear bearing a floral stud. In another Nepalese mukhalingam, the right side of one of the faces is female (Pal 1974:85). This splitting of the faces on the lingam is, of course, only a variation of the Ardhandr!svara figure mentioned before. The fusion of the male and female principles symbolized in the latter in anthropomorphic form and in the combination of lingam and yoni in aniconic form is duplicated in the lingam itself. An even more intimate redundant fusion of male and female in the lifgam-yoni idol appears in a legend of Sri Ardhanareeswara temple, Trichy district, Tamilnad. It is said that, when bathed with honey, the svayambhflihgam reveals on its left side the image of Uma (Parvati) (Census 1966:350). The left side of the rock-lingam in the Himalayan temple of Kedarnath is also said to contain Parvati (Bharanidharan 1975:258). So far, in spite of an extension of its symbolic meaning, the li'ngam has remained solidly associated with Siva, and the inclusion of the female aspect within the male simply corre- sponds to the complex image of Siva himself, without any interchange of symbols. The lingam, however, may also lose its exclusive connexion with Siva and become a symbol of other deities, thus opening the way to a reversal of its original sex- specific connotation. When the king of snakes Nagaraja at Nagercoil is worshipped as a lingam, there is still hardly any shift of meaning, as snake and lingam may be synonymous. Again, that Tanumalayan at Suchindrum, Kanyakumari dis- trict, has a lingam shape is not very surprising, since the temple is basically a Siva temple despite its myth, which speaks of the fusion of Siva, Visnu, and Brahma through the power of Anusaya's chastity. A definite extension of meaning of the lingam symbol appears at Thiruvottiyur, near Madras, where in addition to Siva himself the 27 lunar asterisms are represented as liigas. Such a broadening of meaning equally applies to semantics. Personal names ending in lingam are numerous. While they mostly refer to Sivalifigam with a qualifying epithet-for example, Mahlifigam ("the great") or Cokkalifigam ("the beautiful")- names like Nagalifigam and Ramalifigam also occur. The latter is particularly noteworthy in that it extends the lingam symbol to the Vaisnava camp. While the above extensions of meaning, curious as they may be, do not contradict the basic phallic association of the lingam, in a cave temple of Kashmir Hindu symbolic thought completely reverses Freudian dogma. Three unsculptured rock formations considered to be svayambhliihgas are worshipped as the goddesses Mahakali, MahMlaksmi, and Mahasarasvati (Ananda Vikatan February 14, 1972). Such female lingas are not even particu- larly rare; Mariyamman, at Pudupatti, Salem district, Tamil- nad, is also represented by a stone linigam (Census 1968a:575), and so is Poleramma, at Krishnapatnam, Nellore district Andhra Pradesh (Census 1964d:23). In all these cases, the extension of the lingam symbol to female deities is facilitated by the fact that its original owner Siva is not present as the opposite pole. A further peculiar use of the lingam symbol contradicts not only psychoanalytic, but also structural dogma. It is limited to Maharashtra (and perhaps occasionally Madhya Pradesh?), where Siva and Parvati, Khandoba and Mhalsa (identified with Siva's son Skanda and wife), and other local Saiva couples are regularly represented as two lingas. Just as the fusion of male and female aspects in one figure does not cause any difficulty of interpretation, so the extension of an originally male symbol to other deities without distinction of sex is not particularly difficult to conceive. When male and female beings are represented side by side, however, structural common sense would expect some kind of distinction, however arbitrary. The Gowaris, a pastoral caste of Maharashtra, for instance, represent male and female family members who have died without offspring both by bamboo sticks, but distinguish the male by one cross-piece at the top and the female by two (Russel and Hira Lal 1969:163). Contrary to this simple struc- tural reasoning, in Saiva temples of Maharashtra god and goddess are symbolized by two identical lingas, and, what is more, in some cases they may be represented by two identical combinations of lingam and yoni. While some Hindus not versed in the subtleties of their religious iconography may be ignorant of the respective symbolic meanings of lingam and yonti, such ignorance is to be excluded in the people who created and erected the idols and who were well aware of the fact that one combined liigam-yoni idol would have been sufficient to sym- bolize the divine couple. The only way of explaining this peculiar regional use of a pan-Indian symbol, in my mind, is to postulate a total abstraction from its original sex-bound mean- ing combined with a particular taste for redundance. Even in the perfectly symmetrical juxtaposition of two liigam symbols there remains, of course, the possibility of a positional distinc- tion between Siva and Parvati, the lingam-yoni to the right being thought of as Siva and the one to the left as Parvati. This, however, seems to satisfy very little the requirements for symbolizing binary opposites, especially because the male/ female = right/left association is not absolute in Hindu iconog- raphv. Incidentally, there is even a scriptural basis for the I Though I am not competent to voice an objection against the Sanskrit origin of the word liftgam on linguistic grounds, I find it very strange that such an important and obviously pre-Aryan symbol should only be known by its Sanskrit name, the more so as for the Sanskrit term yoni a Dravidian equivalent exists. In Tamilnad lingam and yoni are normally spoken of as liftgam and dvutaiydr. What could have induced liftgam-yoni worshippers to borrow from Sanskrit only the most important part of the binomial and forget their own term completely? 50 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM interchangeable male and female symbolism of the linigam. The VZmana Purada states that, wherever the liigam of Siva is, Uma resides beside it in the form of a liigam (Pal 1974:86). Apparently, however, the very paradox of this use of the liigam prevented it from becoming generalized; or could it be that the slokas of the Vamana Purada already reflect a particular regional tradition? Though the female liigam is striking, it does not represent the peak of the roughly rising "scenic opposite route" of symbolic thought traced in this paper for two reasons: firstly, in spite of the agreement of the sacred books (with the exception of the Vdmana Purana) on its meaning, the lingam is a stylized emblem and as such liable to further abstraction, and secondly, it is not particularly rare. THE COW Unlike the snake, which derives its alternative male and female associations from behavioural characteristics viewed from differ- ent angles and not from a distinction between male and female snakes (which would be difficult for a layman to make), the cow is visibly and semantically distinguished as a female animal. The "highway" of symbolic thought naturally leads to a female image, and the "scenic opposite route," a male asso- ciation of the cow, seems even more paradoxical than a female liigam. The dominant symbolic association of the cow revolves around its motherly, nurturing qualities. Naturally, the cow need not always symbolize human or divine female beings. Cow and calf were chosen as a symbol of the Congress Party, but this more abstract use astutely plays upon the same theme. The very holiness of the cow stresses the mother image. She is described as the mother of India, the mother of man, or the mother of the gods. The holistic tendency we have seen in the Ardhanar!svara figure and in the combined lingam-yoni idol may also apply to the cattle image. Thus the Atharvaveda mentions the cosmic steer, which is male and yet pregnant and which gives semen as well as milk (Baumann 1955:142). This extraordinary image nevertheless corresponds to the linguistic universal that nor- mally the male category may be extended to include the female. When Aditi, the heavenly cow, in the same text is described as mother and father simultaneously, it is more interesting, be- cause it contradicts the above near universal. Both mythologi- cal beasts of the Atharvaveda, in their fusion of opposites, how- ever, are distinct from the interchangeable male and female symbols that are the subject of this paper. Normally in mythology, whenever a deity is symbolized by an animal whose sexual distinction is relevant, it is the male animal that stands for the god and the female animal that stands for the goddess. A typical example is provided by the bull Nandi, which not only is Siva's steed and doorkeeper, but often represents the god himself. Iconography leaves no doubt about the bull's sexual potency, and mythology elaborates on the same theme. In a delightful story contained in Tiruvilai- yatal (1972:188-90), the Jains desire to destroy Madurai and its king, an upholder of Saivism. They send forth an all- destructive magical cow, hoping thus to put the king into a terrible predicament: either be killed with his subjects or com- mit the crime of cow slaughter, since an evil cow is still a cow. Siva, however, comes to the aid of his royal devotee and sends his bull Nandi. The evil cow is immediately charmed by the bull's masculine beauty, forgets her murderous intent, and engages in lovemaking. Some temple legends, however, ignore this normal corre- spondence between sex of bovine and sex of deity. The legend of Lakshminarasimhaswamy temple, Warangal district, Andhra Pradesh, (Census 1964e:29) relates that LaksmI, the goddess of the Chenchu forest tribe, appeared in the dream of a mendi- cant devotee of Lord Laksminarasimha and informed him that Laksminarasimha (her husband) was buried on a hill. When the Chenchus reached the hill to get the image, they saw a cow suddenly change into a salagrama (fossil ammonite). They took the image and the ?JlagrJma and installed them downhill in a temple. Strictly speaking, as far as the purpose of the story is concerned, the presence of the cow is superfluous here. In the prototype of such discovery legends, the cow acts as the indicator of the hidden idol by pouring out her milk over it. Here this is not necessary, because the dream has already indicated the location of the idol-contrary to the usual se- quence of events, in which a dream may help to reveal what the human actors have not understood in spite of the miraculous signs. The cow therefore makes her appearance simply because of her religious prestige and, what is more, with total disregard for her normal female association. The cow, in fact, does not change into an image of the goddess, which would have been a more plausible turn of events, but into a redundant symbol of Visnu, since the galagrama is considered to be an aniconic form of that god. I do not think that any particular meaning can be attached to this inverted symbolic use of the cow. The madder the madness, the more the hidden meaning (Freilich 1975) need not always be true. In my mind, the cow's transforming herself into Visnu-?dlagrJma simply shows that while any association is theoretically possible and an association respecting the sexual dichotomy is most likely, inversions can never be ex- cluded. Extremes meet, as popular wisdom knew long before the invention of structuralism. Another legend attributing to the cow a male association comes from a Siva temple in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh (Census 1964a:159). The idol, called Sri Potteswara- swamy, is a lingam situated several feet below ground level. According to the legend, the Pandava prince Arjuna, roaming in a forest during his exile, shot an arrow at a kapila (reddish brown cow). Where the belly of the cow fell, it changed into a Sivalifigam, for which a temple was built. The white stripes of the cow's belly are still to be seen on the side of the linigam. In this case the inversion of the symbolic meaning of the cow, the epitome of all female animals for the Hindu, is more radical than in the above legend. Firstly, the cow is equated with 8iva and not with Visnu, whose masculinity is less in evidence than that of Siva and who, if need be, may even transform himself into a beautiful woman and bear Siva's child. Secondly, the cow changes into the phallic lingam and not into the sexually more neutral ?alagrdma symbol. Thirdly, it is the belly of the cow, strongly associated with her female, birth-giving quality, that becomes the lingam and not, as might conceivably have happened, her horns, which may have a male association. A third legend which paradoxically equates the cow with a male deity is one of the versions explaining the name of Go- karna ("cow's ear"), the site of a famous Siva temple on the Kanarese coast of the Indian peninsula. This time it is not a cow that becomes the lingam, but the lingam that changes into a cow (Thomas 1945:53): Siva had granted to the demon Ravana the boon of taking his linigam to Lanka. Realizing that he had promised too much, he decreed that the linigam become rooted the moment it touched the ground. When the linigam was dropped by cowherd-Ganesa, who had promised to hold it, Ravana tried to prevent it from sinking, but the linigam changed into a cow and continued to sink, leaving only its ears above ground. These three male associations of the cow contradict not only common sense, but also the usual supremacy of the male category. Cultural reasons exist, I think, for this stress on the female category in the case of the bovine. In spite of the bull Nandi alias Siva, it is the cow which is the most sacred and most important animal in Hinduism. The prohibition of cow Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980 51</page><page sequence="8">slaughter, for instance, makes the female animal the prototype of the category, subsuming under it male cattle, buffaloes, and other related species of both sexes. THE FEMALE BREAST The female breast would seem to be a natural symbol of woman, not in a metaphorical but in a much closer metonymical sense, and yet it is possible to sever the intimate mental connexion between them. Here we have, in my opinion, the narrowest and steepest "scenic opposite route" of symbolic thought, along which perhaps only Hindus are willing to travel. The traditions of two Siva temples in Andhra Pradesh, both inspired by the somewhat unusual shape of an idol, have re- course to such an extraordinary reversal of associations. The first example is not derived from a legend that justifies the unorthodox shape of an idol; rather, it is this shape that serves to justify the magical powers attributed to the idol. In Viswe- swara temple, East Godawari district, the stone Nandi in front of the linigam is said to resemble the breast of a woman. It is believed that if the devotees desirous of having children worship the liigam and press this "breast" with their hands, a few drops of milklike liquid will trickle out, the number of drops indicating the number of children to be born (Census 1964b:183). The equation bull = woman's breast constitutes a bridge be- tween this section and the preceding one, since simultaneously a sexually distinct bovine evokes an opposite sexual association and the normal mental connexion between female breast and woman is cut asunder. A representation of the bull Nandi, a symbol of virility, which resembles a breast and behaves like a breast is not only a particularly confused hermaphrodite, in which male and female parts do not exist side by side but are inextricably mixed, but also an animal-human hybrid. Such defiance of categories, which in other circumstances might account for extreme impurity, here is seen as a source of magical power because of the summing of male and female, animal and human qualities. Contrary to the above example, the reversal of psychoanalytic and commonsense associations occurring in the legend of Achanteswara temple, West Godawari district, apparently pursues the immediate purpose of explaining the somewhat bulbous shape of the linigam. This legend is much more elaborate than the usual versions justifying imperfections in the idol. It runs as follows (Census 1964c:1 15-16): The sage Acyuta and wife Ganga prayed to Siva for salvation. Siva asked them to offer daily flowers to him and Parvati and imposed on them strict celibacy. When they broke the latter proscription, he cursed them to be reborn as a Brahmin and a dancing girl. Later Siva, in the form of the sage Valmiki, asked the reborn Brahmin to worship his dtma linigam, a small replica of the linigam worn on the body in a casket, eight times a day, i.e. every three hours. Then Siva assumed the form of a servant boy acting as a mediator between the Brahmin and the dancing girl-prosti- tute. One night, tired from sexual intercourse, the Brahmin could not wake up in time to fetch the dtma linigam, which he had removed from his body and left in the kitchen, nor had he time to find sandal paste and flowers necessary for the pu-ji. Helplessly he turned to his beloved, who was asleep with her smooth white breast exposed. There also was some leftover sandal paste and a few betel leaves. He felt that Siva, who is omnipresent, would certainly be present also in the breast, which resembled a Sivalithgam. When he began to worship the breast by smearing sandal paste on it and offering betel leaves in place of flowers, the girl awoke and was upset by his strange behaviour. Returning to his normal state from deep meditation, he explained to her that devotees had often realized the presence of Siva in what they believed to be the god. An innocent shepherd realized the linigam in the dung of sheep, others in a toe or in an inverted corn measure. The dancing girl demanded to see Siva in her breast, and the Brahmin prayed for this to happen. Siva appeared before them in the breast, blessed them both, and granted them salvation. The Sivalingam converted into a stone has all the appearance of a breast. There is no pedestal, and as it emanates from the ground it is said that the remaining portion of the body of the woman is within the ground. The linigam is called chantililgam ("of the breast"). It may be noted that this legend consists of two symmetrical and inverted parts, as the structural analysis of myths usually reveals: the ascetic god Siva curses the amorous couple, while the erotic god Siva blesses it. This inversion, however, only forms the framework of the story. The central theme is the unilateral inversion of the meaning of a single element, the female breast that is equated with the lingam. It is probably not accidental that the somewhat unusually shaped lifigam was not more plausibly said to resemble a flower or some kind of fruit (which indirectly, however, might also evoke a female association) but, much more paradoxically, a breast. The very audacity of the image then gives rise to further, this time cultural absurdities: First, the dissolute Brahmin himself con- tradicts cultural values. A Brahmin is supposed to subjugate his passions, and, since this particular Brahmin's offence in his former life was erotic, one would expect him to make up for it by cultivating asceticism and even resisting the temptations to which Siva might expose him. Second, a puijd takes place after sexual intercourse without a purificatory bath. That the necessity of such a bath does not even occur to the Brahmin in the legend amounts to a total disregard of ritual-purity rules. Third, leftover sandal paste and betel leaves are used in p-ja. According to the Hindu pollution concept, they would be con- sidered on a par with the leftovers on a plate soiled by saliva and would be totally unacceptable to any god under normal circumstances. Also, betel leaves, though they may be offered to gods at the end of a meal, would be out of place as a substi- tute for flowers. As for the unusual objects enumerated by the Brahmin as having been worshipped in lieu of a liigam, dung as excrement is impure but cow dung may be shaped into a cone and wor- shipped, for instance, as Ganesa. Though sheep dung does not have the virtues of cow dung, it is quite conceivable that shepherds might use sheep dung in ritual for lack of cow dung. Substituting a human toe, a rather impure part of the body, for a li"gam would seem to be an insult, but not so in Lingayat ritual. Though the legend is not of Lingayat origin, as the fact that the hero is a Brahmin proves, it apparently has been con- ceived in Lifigayat surroundings, judging from the liAgam pen- dant to be worshipped. It is common practice among Lifigayats to worship the feet of the jangam (literally "walking lifigam," the LiAgayat priest) and to drink the water in which he has dipped his feet or his toe. Besides, the symbolic substitution of a foot (or a toe) for a phallus would not be extraordinary according to Freudian theory. The inverted corn measure, without being impure, pertains to the economic field, which should normally be separate from religion, but the fact that it is said to have been inverted proves that there was an attempt at creating at least a vaguely lingam-shaped object. The choice of the dancing girl's breast in lieu of the linigam is a far greater ritual and psychological absurdity than the others. She is not only ritually inferior as a woman, but also a prostitute, i.e., a particularly impure category of woman. The Brahmin as a last resort might have chosen her head, the noblest part of her body,6 and thereby somewhat attenuated the ritual outrage, but he prefers her breast. One might postulate that the opposition breast/phallus vanishes at a higher taxonomic level, since both are sexual organs. The reputed resemblance of breast and lingam, like the resemblance of bull and breast in the preceding example, 6 For the latent sexual meaning of the head in Punjab, see Hersh- man (1974:277-78). 52 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM probably did arise because of this mental common denominator. The point of the story, however, is not an elision of opposites. The series of absurdities culminating in the equation breast = linigam felicitously demonstrates the boundless grace of Siva according to the bhakti tradition. In this religious view, if there is true devotion, the god will forgive the breach of all rules, be they ritual or commonsense. The reversal of the normal associa- tions of breast and linigam is therefore used to express the negation of traditional ritual values in bhakti religion. THE TERM "MOTHER" To conclude this exposition of interchangeable symbols and paradoxical associations of Hindu gods and goddesses, I shall mention one more, at first sight, absurd use of a female symbol for a male, this time belonging not to legend but to language and referring not to Siva but to Krsna. The Tamil poet and patriot Subramanya Bharati wrote a poem apparently defying even the " 'factual universal' that all kinship systems distin- guish male and female parent by separate terms" (Greenberg 1970:101). The poem is entitled "Krishna My Mother" (Anton 1977: 101). Bharati, of course, is not concerned with sex roles, but wants to express his total dependence on Lord Krsna, who protects him like a mother in the best tradition of bhakti religiosity.7 There is reason to believe that Hinduism predisposes to the interchange of male and female symbols we have been discuss- ing. This may be so because ideas of monistic philosophy have filtered down to the level of popular consciousness; in the legend of the breast-linfgam reference is in fact made to Siva's being omnipresent. Hinduism, however, contains another highly origi- nal philosophico-religious concept that seems to me even more relevant, that of the gods' sports (lild in Sanskrit and tiruvilai- ydtal in Tamil). Siva and other high gods of Hinduism are not bound by causality and preoccupied with teleology, nor do they necessarily act to uphold moral values. All their benign and cruel activities, including creation and destruction, are pure play. This glorification of arbitrariness may leave its mark on Hindu symbolism. DISCUSSION The main purpose of this paper has been to demonstrate that symbolic associations are less psychologically determined than Freudian psychoanalysts are accustomed to think and that "scenic opposite routes" of symbolic thought exist, leaving a margin of arbitrariness. At the same time, I hope to have es- tablished that symbolic meanings are less arbitrary and also less context-bound than structuralists are accustomed to think. I wholly agree with Beck (1978:86) that "a symbol can evoke associations in its own right; it does not depend on a system of contrasts for its meaning." It may be objected that my largely context-free symbolic meanings refer to idols of gods and goddesses, rather a special case comparable to proper names, whose meanings are not defined by context. This is true in a sense, but the comparison cannot be pushed too far. The meanings of proper names, like those of idols, do remain unchanged in the most varied contexts, but male and female names can never be substituted for each other. This is, however, precisely what happens in Hindu ritual and legend, where gods and goddesses may share the same symbols, apparently causing as little inconvenience to their devotees as the custom of giving the same Christian name to various family members (of the same sex only, however) causes traditional European families. My list of interchangeable symbols and paradoxical associa- tions of Hindu gods and goddesses does not claim to be com- plete, but while the examples confirming Freudian theory could have been multiplied ad libitum it would be more difficult to find new cases contradicting psychoanalytic assumptions. Of the ten headings, five are predominantly male symbols which occasionally may become female-the tree, the snake, the ant- hill, the pointed weapon, and the lin'gam-and five are predomi- nantly female symbols which occasionally are given a male meaning-the lotus, the vessel, the cow, the breast, and the term "mother." This equal proportion is accidental; a further subdivision or a somewhat different one could have changed it. Nevertheless, it shows that iconographic and verbal symbols of Hindu deities follow neither the linguistic near universal according to which the male category is basic and may come to include the female nor the cultural universal of sexual asymmetry and male dominance (Rosaldo and Atkinson 1975:61, 72). The fact that it is possible to avoid the "highways" of symbolic thought and choose "scenic opposite routes" shows that even collective thinking has a certain measure of freedom. Curiously enough, the more arbitrary "scenic routes," which totally disregard the dominant meaning of a symbol, are less surprising than the far less arbitrary "scenic route" leading to the opposite meaning. A row of lingas representing the lunar asterisms may produce only a shrug, but a lihgam symbolizing Parvati or a cow's belly equated with a lingam is a challenge to the imagination. This paper has been dedicated to predominantly male sym- bols' occasionally becoming female and vice versa, but such extraordinary reversals of the meanings of individual symbols (as distinguished from the structuralists' reversals of correla- tions) are not limited to the male/female dichotomy. Hindu iconography contains another such paradox. Ithyphallic figures in India and elsewhere normally evoke an association of eroticism and fertility. Such figures may be partially stripped of their sexual connotation by being made protectors of gardens, as in the case of Priapus in the ancient Near East or of certain scarecrows in present-day India. The reversal of their primary meaning is difficult to conceive, and yet Indian thought has accomplished it. By looking at ithyphallism from a different perspective, an ithyphallic yogi may be seen as a symbol of perfect asceticism (O'Flaherty 1973:267). Again, the whole of Saktism in a way constitutes such a "scenic opposite route" of symbolic thought. While for the majority of Hindus the domi- nant divine principle is male, for Sakti worshippers it is female, and while normally all polluting acts and substances are ex- cluded from Hindu ritual the saktas of the "left hand" inten- tionally include them. Though Hinduism perhaps predisposes to such paradoxical inversions, they also occur elsewhere. Hair symbolism is a case in point, and here Indians apparently choose only the "high- way" of symbolic thought while the Western imagination travels either the "highway" or the "scenic opposite route." Leach (1958:154) has pointed out the astonishingly high pro- portion of cases from all over the world which fit the pattern long hair = unrestricted sexuality/short, partially shaved or tightly bound hair = restricted sexuality/close-shaved hair = celibacy, corresponding to the "highway" of symbolic thought in my terminology. In most of the social uses of hair symbolism mentioned by Hallpike (1969:254-64) and Hershman (1974: 274-98), this dominant sexual connotation is transparent. Leach furthermore cites the case of Burmese and Assamese unmarried girls, who wear their hair short while married women wear it long in order to express different status categories and not sexual behaviour. Here we have what I would call a totally arbitrary "scenic route" of symbolic thought, unconnected with the main meaning. The reversal, the "scenic opposite route" to 7 The same idea was expressed by Pope John Paul I on Septem- ber 13, 1978, when he spoke of God as more like a mother than a father.

Christian monks, like their Buddhist counterparts, have shaven heads, in accordance with the domi- nant symbolic association; viewing the same feature from a different angle produces the European notion that balding is a sign of enhanced virility. This secondary idea may be derived from a desire for rightful compensation: that decreased hand- someness be compensated for by increased virility. On the other hand, a bald head also exaggerates the difference in hair- style between man and woman normally symbolized by shorter hair versus longer hair and hence may be thought to denote accentuated masculinity. The actor who permanently displays a shaven head certainly does not want to stress his asceticism, but on the contrary wishes to create an image of strong mas- culinity. According to Beck (1978:85), associations occur in a multi- dimensional space rather than being binary, but binary cate- gories are also relevant, as this study proves. The interchange- ability of male and female symbols and associations in Hindu- ism and the contradictory interpretations of ithyphallism and baldness teach us something about our use of such binary cate- gories in creating symbols. When we are symbolizing one concept, its contrary normally remains latent and distinct, but we may also play with the opposites as if they were balls in the hands of a juggler. Our minds obviously do not enjoy the absolute freedom of Hindu gods indulging in their sports. Nevertheless, some measure of arbitrariness exists, as I hope to have shown. We may avoid the "highway" of symbolic thought, but behind it another highway opens, that of binary categories. Even though we succumb to the lure of the latter, or because we do so, however, we still have the possibility of thinking the unlikely. Comments by ARJUN APPADURAI c/O Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104, U.S.A. 1 vi 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's essay certainly demonstrates that a compromise is feasible and necessary between the radically context-free approach of Freudian theory and the radically context-dependent approach of structuralism to the problem of symbolic meaning. She has also used an admirable range of ethnographic and archival materials to demonstrate the plastic- ity of Hindu thought in regard to issues of divinity and gender. Her findings are persuasive, but her analysis could be pushed farther and theoretically refined. The essay suffers from a lack of conceptual and terminological distinctions. It would have profited from a scheme (following Peirce 1932) that discrirninates indexical, iconic, and symbolic signs. By extension, the author could have attempted a more careful analysis of the different ways in which these symbols are linked to their meanings-relations of reference, connotation, and other kinds of association. This would have clarified rela- tions which, as the essay stands, are interchangeably described by such usages as "means," "represents," "is associated with," and so forth. Such terminological distinctions are especially germane to Hindu religious thought, where the relationship between signs and their referents is largely indexical (i.e., based on a "natural" association between sign and referent) and where representa- tions of divinities stand in a metonymic rather than a meta- phoric relationship to their subjects. (The linhgam does not simply represent Siva, but, in an important sense, is Siva.) If these features of indexicality and metonymy do chacterize the relationship between Hindu religious signs and their referents, we still have to account for the important occasions of semantic inversion that Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi so carefully documents. Her own hypothesis is that these occasions of inversion can largely be explained by a filtered-down Hindu monism and a more specific propensity of Hindu divinities to "play" with their visible forms and properties. These useful suggestions can be pushed farther, if my arguments concerning indexicality and metonymy are correct. Hindu thought may well be less con- cerned with the interchangeability of certain meanings than with the transformability of certain states, here those institu- tionalized in divine gender. Following Foucault's (1970) analy- sis of premodern European thought, it might be argued that for Hindus as well the universe is a complex set of signs from which to divine "the order of things." In Hindu thought, how- ever, this natural order is itself fluid and inherently subject to transformation, inversion, and flux. Perceptual inversion is thus not merely permissible, but mandatory in some circumstances. The female linigam, the bull-as-breast, the breast-as-linigam are all examples of a special type of compromise between the Hindu view of what is ontologically possible and what is epistemologi- cally feasible. If Siva can be a bull, and Siva is subject to radical transformations, may we not justifiably see a female breast in the form of the bull and proceed to expect it to lactate? Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's essay takes us a considerable dis- tance toward appreciating the need for a theory of signification that takes account of such cultural systems as the Hindu one. by AGEHANANDA BHARATI Department of Anthropology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, N.Y. 13210, U.S.A. 22 v 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's "simile" of "highways" vs. "scenic routes" is indeed helpful for what she tries to establish in this important contribution. Since the interchangeability of linAgam and yoni as icons and objects of formal worship is warranted by the Sthalapurdanas and other established local lore, I think she might have undertaken this whole enterprise not only without the benefit of psychology, but also without that of Levi-Strauss. It seems to me that her findings come through loud and clear and that the incorporation of school-anthropology pensuins weakens rather than strengthens her point. "Symbol" is not a term that translates any Indian term-at least not in the sense generated by Western "symbol" users, including Jung, Freud, and Turner. For many years, I made it a point to ask Hindu pandits what the linhgam was and, less frequently, what the yoni was. Not a single one of them said it was an x, x being an Indian (Sanskrit, Bengali, Hindi) word for "symbol." The only scholar who said that the linhgam was a pratika (that is, a representation or stand-in) of Siva was a professor of philosophy at an Indian university, where philosophy (both Western and Indian) is taught and thought in English. All the pandits said that the linhgam was Siva and (more rarely, because I asked them more rarely) that the yoni was the devi. The explanation directed at Westerners by an intermediary invariably inserts "symbol," i.e., the linhgam is a symbol of Siva, the yoni a symbol of the god- dess. I don't think it is that easy. If the cultural agent, the specialist, insists that the linigam is Siva, then "symbol" apolo- getic is not warranted unless we state expressly that this is an etic device, not part of the corpus analyzed. In the legends and the temple lore Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi has researched, I would think, therefore, that all statements imply- ing the symbolic identity of god and goddess, or of linhgam and yoni, could be trimmed to read the identity of the god and the goddess, of lingam and yoni. In fact, her "highway"-"scenic route" simile checks out rather nicely for a desymbolized state- ment, which would also be more in line with the cultural agents' notions (I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was emic, since the juxtaposition of highways and scenic routes is no part of the Indian cultural landscape). She does not have to be apologetic about contradicting Freudian theories-more power to her for so doing! She is certainly right when she gives priority to linguistic exigencies in the arbitrary assignment of male or CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Eicizinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM female to divinities where the base of such assignment is Sanskrit or, for that matter, any Indian language, not excluding the Dravidian. She lists an impressive array of serpentine symbolism but overlooks the frequent Sanskritic homology of a woman's braided hair with a black cobra, ndgardjarfupa 'of the shape of the king of snakes.' This is so well-worn an epithet of female pulchritude that it seems unlikely that it did not make its way into Tamil lore. Though the lotus is no doubt a more pervasive marker in general beauty parlance, the cobra outranks the lotus when a woman's capillary splendor is eulogized. I am not sure that water is a "predominantly female symbol" as the author avers; in Vedic and northern traditions this is certainly not the case. Apah, the Vedic cognate of aqua as a deity, and Varuna, the other deity connected with water, are male. Does she refer only to the Tamil situation? There is some problem in considering "the linigam and the earth and the lingam and water as binary opposites" for the Tamil Hindu scene: the remaining three "element-lingas" (bhitalihga) -the wind-linigam at Kalahasti, the fire-lingam at Tiruvannamalai, and the ether-lingam at Chidambaram- should then be similarly arranged, which leaves us with an unassigned spare; somehow, I feel very uncomfortable with the "redundant additions" which would have to be marshalled to accommodate the three other linhgas in this powerful scenario. Apropos of villagers' being "at times . . . ignorant of its [the liingam's] phallic meaning": not only villagers. Indeed, a whole slew of perfectly literate northern urban "modern" Hindus, Arya Samajis and others, take great pains to deny the phallic connotation; they say it is a yfupa 'sacrificial pole'-but then, Freud would ask, what is a sacrificial pole? Though urban puri- tans are certainly not ignorant of the phallic meaning which they deny, there is no doubt that less articulate people in most parts of India, especially women, are ignorant of it. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's parallel between the Hindu's not thinking of sex when he thinks of the linhgam and the Christian's not thinking of cannibalism when he thinks of the Host is novel and felici- tous. True enough, lingam, Sanskrit for "sign," is to the prac- titioner just that-a sign of Siva, not a symbol. The lingam's aniconicity is not arbitrary, since in the last analysis Siva is formless. It is true that the -linga affix occurs in frequent non-Sivite first names. Ramalingan, however, is not Vaisnava in this sense, since it refers to the (Siva-)linga established by Rama at Ramesvaram-by the same token, of course, Rames- varam is a Sivite shrine, i.e., "the Lord of Rama." There is a distinct possibility that the ritualistic-iconographic assimilations of the goddess to the male deity derive, in a Whorffian sense, from the nominal morphology of Sanskrit (as indeed of all classical Indo-European languages): when mascu- line and feminine merge in a compound, its gender is invariably masculine; somewhat ludicrously this may even have carried over through Indo-European centuries into the happily obsoles- cent "Mr. and Mrs. John Williams." by RONALD L. CAMPBELL Center for the Holistic Sciences, 6 Big Tree Rd., Woodside, Calif. 94062, U.S.A. 1 vi 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's article is an intriguing attempt to examine the complex and difficult subject of the interchange of Hindu male-female symbols. She is to be congratulated for the scholarly inquiry into a paradoxical symbol system that has tra- ditionally been shrouded by the esoteric Hindu thought process. She has correctly discerned that Freudian interpreta- tions and Jung's ideas, as well as structuralist concepts on symbolism, reflect one-sided views of a system of symbols that conceals more than it reveals. It seems to me, however, that she merely states the obvious by defining the problem and fails to offer definitive solutions to this scholarly enigma. Also, her descriptive data do not seem to help her in refuting Jung's and Fromm's deterministic concepts. She does not support her opinion that "the only true mental universals are to be found in language and in the related field of kinship systems and ter- minology"; in fact, she does not even address herself to this subject. (In contrast, Aurobindo contends that these symbols' secrets are hidden within a secret code in the Rig Veda.) I am not at all sure that she supports the premise of "an element of caprice in the use of symbols." On the positive side, I like some of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's descriptive analysis of certain symbols. Symbols, it must be remembered, are concrete representations of abstract philoso- phical principles. I question whether one can arbitrarily take a variety of symbols from a variety of socio-philosophical-reli- gious traditions and throw them into one short article, thus dramatically revealing their true significance. Hindu religion has ancient roots and a multiplicity of schools which, even within a specific tradition, give different meanings to the same symbol. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi of course speaks of the popular meaning and the esoteric significance of the sages who formu- lated the symbolism. She recognizes that Hinduism is monistic and that some Hindu Vedanta schools, such as Shankara's (kevalddvaitavada), are characterized by unqualified nondualism. In this knowledge lie the clues as to the reason for the inter- changeable symbols and paradoxical associations of Hindu gods and goddesses-who, after all, are merely forces of nature that represent the Hindu ultimate ground of existence. I am dissatisfied with Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's analysis of the snake symbol. In its esoteric meaning it represents kundalini energy within man. It is remarkable that, at a time when so many European, Russian, American, and Japanese scientists are creating machines to tap and measure this energy system, the author completely misses this symbolism in the Hindu system of thought. It is especially so in view of the Hindus' claim that by activating this sleeping energy source within man one can transcend the separation between the self and the ultimate ground of being, thus experientially and paradoxically fulfilling her goal of understanding the interchangeable male- female symbols of Hindu mythology. by JULES DE LEEUWE Suezkade 173, 's-Gravenhage, The Netherlands. 27 iv 79 Noch konkrete symbolen, noch hun "archetypen" of strukturen die de strekking ervan zouden bepalen, zijn m.i. ooit aange- boren, anders dus dan zowel Freud als Jung of Levi-Strauss beweren. Symbolen ontstaan bij elk individu opnieuw maar daarmee nog niet willekeurig. De mogelijkheid tot vervangende uitbeelding is in zoverre aangeboren als bouw van en outwikke- ling binnen het menselijk zenuwstelsel, onder invloed van de individuele ervaringen, steeds opnieuw resulteren in een psy- chisch proces beginnend met niet-onderscheiden, dat loopt via gebrekkig onderscheiden en verwisselen, in der richting van onderscheiden en samenvattend plaatsen (verg. Piaget, o.a. 1926 en 1937). Symbolen ontlenen hun vorm, inhoud en strek- king aan het maatschappelijk heden dat van meet af op het individu inwerkt, waarbij het verleden, voor zover het over- komt, niet wordt geerfd maar via traditie zijn neerslag vindt, ten dele doelgericht, ten dele gedurende korter of langer tijd onontkoombaar verankerd in taal, gebruiken, heersende of juist oppositionele denkbeelden e.d.m. (De Leeuwe, o.a. 1953). Zeer kort moge ik ingaan op de vermoedelijk belangrijkste groep voorbeelden van Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: de symbolen voor het mannelijke en voor het vrouwelijke. Bij nader onder- zoek blijken ze slechts onder bepaalde omstandigheden en op bepaalde manieren onderling verwisselbaar. Hoewel ik onvol- doende weet over Indiase maatschappijen en hun verleden, komt het me voor, dat Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi historische en vooral materieile voorwaarden verwaarloost juist door haar Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980</page><page sequence="12">pogingen om "kontekst-vrije" symbolische betekenissen bijeen te brengen. Bij mijn stelselmatig onderzoek van etnografisch materiaal, door derden verzameld omtrent Centraalafrikaanse Pigmeeen, Noordarnhemlandse autochtonen en zekere gemeen- schappen uit de Nieuwe-Hebriden, kwam (opnieuw) aan de dag, dat weliswaar in principe alles hetzij als vrouwelijk of als mannelijk of als beide of als sekseloos kan worden opgevat; maar wat in deze of in gene maatschappij in grote lijnen feitelijk in dit opzicht gebeurt, blijkt bepaald door maatschappelijke ontwikkelingswetten. De willekeurige onderlinge verwisselbaar- heid is schijn, behalve aan de marge. Globaal uitgedrukt komt het erop neer, dat de mate waarin en de wijze waarop mensen en dingen mannelijk en/of vrouwel- ijk worden gedacht, afhangt van de door een stand van de produktiekrachten uiteindelijk bepaalde plaats van de seksen in een menselijke maatschappij. Wat dit betreft kan een maat- schappij min of meer egalitair of meer gynekokratisch of meer androkratisch zijn ingericht. Er behoeft trouwens niet altijd sprake te zijn van symboliek = "vervangende uitbeelding." De situatie pleegt nog gekompliceerd te worden door nawerking van machtsverhoudingen en daarbij behorende opvattingen uit het verleden: vernieuwingen kunnen aan oude vormen en inhouden worden toegevoegd. Het vrouwelijke of het mannelijke kan alomvattend worden geacht naar gelang van (de levend geble- ven herinnering aan) de historische faze waarin een maat- schappij verkeert. Dat mannen daarbij als een soort vrouwen kunnen worden gezien, het wezenlijke aan een fallus vrouwelijk kan worden geacht of juist omgekeerd vrouwen als een soort mannen worden beschouwd enz., blijkt schering en inslag (De Leeuwe 1978 en de daar vermelde publikaties, 1980). [Contrary to the theories of both Freud and Jung and Levi- Strauss, symbols or "archetypes" or structures are never innate, as far as I can see. All symbols are acquired individually, though not arbitrarily. The potentiality for representation-through- substitution is built into the human nervous system in the sense that psychic discernment can only develop from nondiscern- ment through faulty discernment, taking one thing for another, to correct discernment and integration (cf. Piaget 1926, 1937, among others). Symbols acquire their forms, contents, and purports through the influence of social reality on each in- dividual from the beginning; the past is not (biologically) inherited, but acquired and learned-partly purposefully im- parted, but for the rest transmitted through the language, habits, prevailing and opposing opinions, etc., in which it is rooted (De Leeuwe 1953, among others). I want to comment very briefly on Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's pre- sumably most important examples, the symbols for femininity and masculinity. It turns out on further investigation that these symbols are interchangeable only under certain conditions and in certain ways. Though I am insufficiently informed on Indian societies and their past, it seems to me that Eichinger Ferro- Luzzi neglects historical conditions (particularly material ones) in her attempt to present "context-free" symbolic meanings. Systematic research on ethnographic data collected by others on the Pygmies of Central Africa, the Aborigines of northern Arnhem Land, and a number of societies in the New Hebrides has taught me, once again, that while in principle all beings and things may be looked upon as female, male, both, or neither, the lines along which this is done in a particular society are determined by laws of societal development. Except for mar- ginal variations, any arbitrary interchangeability of symbols is only apparent. Broadly speaking, the extent to which, and the ways in which, all beings are looked upon as female and/or male depends on the social positions of the sexes, ultimately the result of the level of the productive forces. Thus some societies may be relatively egalitarian, others more or less gynecocratic, still others more or less androcratic. Apart from this, the ascribed femininity or masculinity may have more than a (merely) sym- bolic meaning. The situation is often further complicated by the fact that former positions of power and conceptions arising from them are remembered and have after-effects; new forms and contents may simply be added to older ones. Thus the phase of development in which a society stands (including the memories handed down from the past) may imply that things are to be considered mainly female or mainly male. As a consequence, in some societies or groups men may be looked upon as a kind of women and a phallus may be considered fundamentally female, while in others women may be seen as a kind of men, etc. (De Leeuwe 1978 and the literature mentioned there, 1980).] by I. C. JARVIE Department of Philosophy, York University, Toronto, Ont., Canada M3J 1P3. 15 v 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's examples certainly dispose of the idea of universal or natural symbolic associations. A comment about caprice in the choice of symbols: When something is taken to symbolize something else, the mechanism would seem to be one of recognizing or imputing an analogy or making an associa- tion. Yet what looks analogous to what, what we associate with what, is not an arbitrary or capricious matter. Analogy, association, and imputation all base themselves on resemblance, and what can be taken to resemble what is a matter of point of view, of theory. To be more precise, any two things can be claimed to resemble one another under the aspect of some theory or point of view. To accept that x symbolizes y is implic- itly or explicitly to articulate a theory that connects the two. Some of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's examples are very rarefied, thus not only making her point-namely, how unexpected and counterintuitive symbolic associations can be (i.e., how much they run against the grain of strong theoretical expectations)- but also, perhaps against her intentions, showing that such ingenuity does not gain wide diffusion, perhaps because the theories required to allow the asserted symbolic connection to make sense incur resistance. It could be asked both of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's and of my view how they explain the acceptability and popularity of some symbols and not others. Since I believe anything can be a symbol of anything else only provided that a theory can be devised that connects them, and since we can always connect any two objects or events by a theory, acceptability will always be possible. Popularity is different. Why and how a theory gets widely diffused is a problem in cognitive sociology that can only be summarily dealt with here. Two main possibilities present themselves: (1) a theory diffuses because of its coherence with other theories; (2) a theory diffuses because of its success. In a culture in which many of the explanatory theories people use in everyday life are animistic, the coherence of any new theory with what we might call the metatheoretic commitment to animism-rather than particular current animistic theories-will be a control on their popular diffusion. In an officially antianimistic culture such as industrial society, commitment to the animistic metatheoretic demand would inhibit the diffusion of a theory and hence of symbolic association. A more positive factor in diffusion might be the success of the connecting theory. A theory that successfully explains and predicts phenomena and facilitates the develop- ment of effective technology opens the way for symbolic associ- ations. A problem remains regarding those very popular symbol systems that draw on theories that have no currency or are unsuccessful or even destructive. For example, much body symbolism fails to reflect the realities of chemical, biochemical, and electrical-mechanical theories of its working. 56 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM by SUDHIR KAKAR Centre for Study of Developing Societies, 29, Rajpur Rd., Delhi, India. 16 v 79 In an otherwise excellent and stimulating paper, I feel that the author has missed the central fact that the modern psychoana- lytic view of symbols is not as far from her own position as she may believe. There is a general consensus among psychoana- lysts that a symbol is a symbol only when it works as a symbol. In other words, the interpretation of symbols in a dream with- out an intimate knowledge of the dreamer may be intellectually stimulating, but it is not considered a valid exercise because symbols cannot be isolated from their context. In psychoana- lysis, of course, this context is less cultural than developmental. For example, the snake has traditionally been interpreted as a phallic symbol, since the phallic, oedipal level was for a long time a central concern of psychoanalysis. With the extension of interest to the earlier developmental levels, we see that the snake-phallus equation, though the most common, is not in- variant. The snake can be a symbol of bisexuality (Bettelheim 1955:196), of maternal devouring and engulfment (Kakar 1978:150), or of oral aggression (Ehrenzweig 1949:112, 116)- all of these symbolic equations arising from the oral level and ultimately related to the infant's wish to be, and fear of being, "reabsorbed" by the mother. The relatively greater bisexuality of Hindu symbolism, I suggest, is related to the predominance in Hindu culture (Kakar 1978) of the earlier, oral edition of unconscious fantasy rather than the later, phallic edition on which psychoanalysis concentrated during the time it was making its first discoveries in symbolism. by R. S. KHARE Department of Anthropology, University of Virginia, Char- lottesville, Va. 22903, U.S.A. 3 vi 79 This paper is a useful exercise as far as it goes. It aims to be a structural study of symbolic relations and a symbolic study of structural relations. Its strength and success lie in offering symbolically significant examples. Some of these are quite stbhtle and capable of extended cultural analysis. Deities designated as father and/or mother and "female breast"- linigam are cases in point: When gods are called "mother" or "father-mother" and goddesses "father" or "mother-father" (maibaap in North India), interesting questions of cultural justification (cosmology) are raised that go beyond contextual language use and meaning. Characterizing these situations as "inversions" and "paradoxes" is only a partial explanation. Divine paradoxes are often entries into cultural rethinking. The practical, the metaphorical, and the transcendental are called upon to telescope into each other for a better view of the dis- tant, but without a distortion of the cultural reality. Telescop- ing is as integral to cultural transformations as are freer associa- tions. "Female breast"-liifgam is therefore a case aptly ad- dressed (for more and different cases, see O'Flaherty 1976:338- 44, 355-57). However, the full significance of this exercise remains clouded. The "scenic opposite route,' even when "narrow" and "steep," is an intriguing pointer, but what exactly it is or can be we are not told. "Scenic routes," like "highways," sometimes end in dead ends or encounter unsuspected gradients, curves, turnoffs, and even turn-overs. They are a better metaphor for transfor- mations and processes than for binary oppositions. Unfortu- nately, transformational procedures are neglected here in favor of binary oppositions. However, the data, even though almost entirely regional and uneven in quality (i.e., some scriptural, some ethnographic, some folk, some popular), are amenable to this procedure. Actually, if carefully extended further, Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's discussion of the lihgam can, I think, not only illustrate convincingly the culturally deep, reversible transfor- mations, but also show us how to reduce the "structuralists' torture of ethnography" and yet render symbolic sui generis not only in posse but in esse. This consideration of the lin'gam brings me to a methodologi- cal point variously made elsewhere (Khare 1978a, b) on study- ing the semantic, cultural domains of symbolic constructs in Indian civilization. Since the latter involves long-standing literary and lexical traditions, the symbolic constructs most often participate in long-existing, codified, intricately struc- tured, multiple domains of logical relations and meanings. Transformations proceed in terms of these domains, and if successlully deciphered they are helpful in showing how changes, shifts, inversions, and new recombinations may (often selec- tively) occur among them. However, the cultural ground rules for these changes are usually so complex that an analyst can neither simplify nor ignore nor "redo" the semantic domain beyond a certain point. The lingam is indeed appropriate for such an exercise. It has enormous cultural depth, a point Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi is evi- dently aware of but does not systematically discuss. Her cursory discussion of the concept of the linigam in Dravidian culture is useful, but the fact that Sanskrit presents a semantic category of enormous depth and breadth cannot be ignored (e.g., see Apte 1965:816-17). Symbolizations and logical recombinations often play upon the multiple semantic domains of higam, which may mean gender (rather than only the male gender); a mark, sign, icon, or token; a proof or evidence; a meaning-specifier; an effect or product; a subtle body (again, either male or female); and, among other things, an image of a god or goddess (and not only Siva). Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's several "paradoxical" asso- ciations begin to fall into place against this background, and a correct, culturally sensitive direction is set for further analysis- even of transformations. Roughly, three overlapping semantic domains are easily distinguishable in the above list: grammati- cal, symbolic and iconic, and logical (disquisitional) relations and expressions. We need to know how these are linked to reveal that larger symbolic system that should be capable of yielding strata, ranges, and transformational zones of meaning and that may also let us know the intrinsic peculiarities (if any) of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's "scenic opposite routes." Opposites-"as if they were balls in the hands of a juggler"- receive sensitive treatment in this exercise, but we do not clearly know if this is dualism or some subtler domain which struc- turalism, as usually practiced, would avoid, leaving it to a finely tuned cultural analysis to handle. The practical and the meta- phorical, the material and the mental have so grown in the orders of the linigam for millennia that to establish these dividers is to violate the logic of Indian cultural cognition and meaning (cf. Sahlins 1976 for a parallel symbolic argument from the Western cultural condition). The lifigam, as a cultural locus, has "fashioned" such a wide range of meanings in India for so long that it differentiates but does not-cannot-divide. This is an integrity of the Indian cultural logic we cannot fail to notice. In evidence, a devotee (Appar) from the South charac- teristically offers reversible transformations between the bodily and the mental: "With body as [his] temple; with mind ever subject to him; with truthfulness as purity; with the light of the mind as his liniga; with love (bhakti) as melted butter and milk together with the holy water; let us offer sacrifice to the Lord" (quoted in Dhavamony 1971:152). The relational "arbitrariness" of the Indian "scenic routes" which attracts Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi has, in my view, a sys- temic cultural integrity that may be specifically Indian in logical and ideational emphasis but is neither capricious in sym- bolization nor unconstrained in relational properties. Only a misreading of the evolution of the Indian mind and its use of its expressive culture renders cultural specificity unique and crea- tive "free associations" random rather than underwritten by Vol. 21 N No. 1 * February 1980 57</page><page sequence="14">certain general cultural directions. Specificity is comparable, but uniqueness is not, and the latter attempts to maintain a cultural system incommunicado. I hope I have understood Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's notion of symbolic arbitrariness cor- rectly as I make these general observations. by WESTON LA BARRE Department of Anthropology, Duke University, Durham, N.C. 27706, U.S.A. 16 iv 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi unfortunately misrepresents the Freud- ian position, which does indeed stress the arbitrariness of symbols, as any reader of the standard statement by Jones (1961) would know. The proper contrast is between Freudian ad hoc empiricism and Jung's mystical archetypes-and, in fact, in the hands of some structuralists, symbols are often treated as closer to Jung's "universals," as in some panhuman dream- book. All that Freudians would aver (Fromm hardly speaks for Freud!) is that, since the human body is a cross-cultural phenomenon, body-image projections in symbols would tend to replicate one another-though Freudians would be much more sophisticated dynamically about supposed inverse cases. So confused are Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's dichotomies as to have us suppose that all schools do not concede that some symbolisms are "culturally inherited." Furthermore, the Chomskyan"true mental" language "universals" she chooses to espouse by no means represent standard opinion among linguists. Freud's concepts of "overdetermination" and "condensation" make "polysemy" no new discovery. When Eichinger Ferro- Luzzi writes that "associations are interchanged with total disregard of Freudian theory," she ignores the fundamental tenet that the meaning of a Freudian symbol is its associations; and in this specific case she is manifestly ignorant of the volu- minous analytic literature on "the woman with a penis" and its clinical meaning. It is tiresome to find false imputations to Freud still fearlessly demolished and disheartening to see parad- ing of ignorance still taken seriously as intellectual commerce. Experienced clinicians would not be "surprised" at these Hin- duist data, but they would understand their meaning better. WVhat Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi has demonstrated, quite beauti- fully, is that even "obvious" symbols are by no means rigidly universal-a Freudian position quite opposite to Jung's. by DERYCK 0. LODRICK Department of Geography, Humboldt State University, Arcata, Calif. 95521, U.S.A. 28 v 79 As a member of a discipline that has faced and, I trust, largely overcome its own ogre of deterministic thinking, I am sympa- thetic to the aims of this paper, yet I find myself unable to accept Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's views without serious reserva- tions. Having dismissed both psychoanalytical and structuralist interpretations of symbols and arguing against the universality of meaning and the relevancy of context, the author, in her sug- gested element of caprice, seems to ignore the importance of both meaning and context in understanding symbols. Lack of mental constraints can theoretically lead to an infinity of sym- bolic associations, yet this infinity is certainly not apparent in the examples she has selected. Quite to the contrary, the con- sistency of the sexual symbolism, even though it involves the reversal of male and female associations, suggests that some constraints are at work-constraints that may originate in a universality of symbolic associations, in the Indian cultural tradition to which the symbols belong, or in other factors of which the observer may be totally unaware. In Freudian thinking, the tree represents the male symbol par excellence, and, as Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi points out, there are numerous instances in which this association is seen in India. One might add to her list the kapittha or "monkey-erection" tree, identified variously as the wood apple, the mango, or the cashew, whose shape is likened to a closed fist with the thumb poking out through the fingers like a monkey's phallus (Walker 1968:217). The tree is also seen as a source of fertility. On occasion I have observed Hindu women circumambulating a particular pipal tree (Ficus religiosa) at Assi glhat in Varanasi (Benares), winding colored thread around the trunk in a cere- mony to ensure their bearing many children. Such practices, as noted by Crooke (1896:99) and Frazer (1951 [1911]:51), are quite common throughout northern India. In this aspect, how- ever, the tree is feminine, a symbol of the maternal energy of nature and ultimately of the source of all life, the Great Mother herself (Neumann 1955:48). Persistent echoes of this symbol- ism abound in India, from the tree-goddesses (vriksa-devatas) of mythology to the horned goddess, perhaps a mother goddess, shown standing in a pipal tree on seals recovered from Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (Basham 1954:23). In that much of Indian iconography may be traced back to the Indus Valley civilization and certain elements perhaps even to ancient Mesopotamia, cultural origins would seem to explain the female associations of the tree in India as adequately as universal symbolism. In reality, symbols are circumscribed by their cultural set- tings and derive some measure of their meaning from their particular situation, whether this reflects merely the prosaic need to explain the siting of a Hindu temple or Zimmer's (1946:195) contention that Indian symbols serve to voice the underlying truths of Indian philosophy. Furthermore, where an object such as the tree has a dual, i.e., male/female, character, "the accent of [the] symbol depends in large measure on the ... culture situation in which it is embedded" (Neumann 1955: 49). With this in mind, I find no great difficulty in accepting a male association of the female breast or a female association of the snake in a society replete with apparent contradictions, reversals of roles, and associations of opposites. I do not see where the element of caprice enters the question, although I accept that the meaning of some symbols may not be under- standable in terms of universal concepts or, indeed, any frame of reference known to us-which does not mean that none exists. If this is what Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi is trying to say, I find her choice of analogy somewhat cumbersome. Rather thanr wander around in a maze of scenic routes and scenic opposite routes, I prefer to remain on the highway, braving the jungle of the collective unconscious, on the one hand, and the slough of structuralism, on the other, but always acutely aware that highways, especially in India, may rapidly become byways or even disappear altogether. by JOHN L. MCCREERY 299B Mansfield St., New Haven, Conn. 06511, U.S.A. 25 iv 79 In The Interpretation of Dreams Freud (1962[1900]:353) cate- gorically states that symbols "frequently have more than one or even several meanings. Thus, the correct interpretation can only be arrived at on each occasion from context." Also, "in addition to symbols which can stand with equal frequency for the male and female genitals, there are some which designate one of the sexes predominantly or almost exclusively, and yet others which are known only with a male or female meaning" (pp. 358-59). Freud's next sentence is the one for which Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi takes him to task: "For it is a fact that the imagination does not admit of long stiff objects and weapons as symbols of the female genitals or of hollow objects ... being used as symbols for the male ones." Freud does not rule out more abstract or nonsexual meanings for either set of symbols. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi discusses ten sets of symbols, but only two-pointed weapons and vessels-belong to types-weapons and hollow objects which Freud insisted have definite sexual referents if they have sexual referents at all. The assertion that these symbols are sometimes used abstractly to represent gods and goddesses, regardless of sex, does not in fact contradict Freud's statements, which admit the possibility of these sym- 58 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM bols' having nonsexual meanings. As for the other eight sets, Freud himself stated plainly that there are symbols equally likely to have male or female meanings as well as those which usually, but not always, have one meaning or the other. How does one know, moreover, that a symbol's sex-bound associations "have vanished"? Abstraction can "neutralize" them by making them logically irrelevant, but logic alone is an unreliable guide to the interpretation of symbols, which may -as symbols often do-convey contradictory messages. Why isn't it possible, for example, for a trident which represents a goddess to be an especially potent symbol of divinity because it associates, unconsciously, male genitalia with a goddess? Paradox, after all, is the very stuff of which powerful statements about divine transcendence are made, as the story of the lecherous Brahman's venerating Shiva in the form of his mistress's breast so aptly demonstrates. I wonder, too, where Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi discovered that structuralism "stresses the arbitrariness of all symbols"? I would have said that the structuralist goal of revealing elemen- tary structures underlying all symbolism pointed in the oppo- site direction. The search for a universal "logic in tangible qualities" (Levi-Strauss 1970 [1964]:1) is hardly compatible with the view that symbols are arbitrarily constructed. What Sperber (1975) attacks is the idea that symbols express already established meanings. He argues, instead, that symbols stimulate searches for meanings and thus contribute to the process of creating meanings. I would add the inference that, since this process depends on metaphorical or metonymical relationships between symbols and the meanings they evoke, these relationships cannot be purely arbitrary. They are limited by inherent properties of symbolic materials as well as cultural conventions. by BALAJI MUNDKUR Box U-42, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Conn. 06268, U.S.A. 1 v 79 \nthropologists, psychoanalysts, and historians of religion who at"empt to discern "meanings" hidden within the obscurities of symbols and myths face many obstacles. Some of these may be methodological (see Strensky 1973 and Hubbard 1973). Others are latent in information that defies facile hypothesizing. The obstacles posed by Hinduism are especially noteworthy not merely because some components of its high philosophies are intertwined with an extensive body of ritual practices in today's folk cults, but primarily because its ancient traditions are recorded in intelligible detail in an immense literature. This, moreover, is largely free from ambiguities like those found in less well-understood religions of other ancient civilizations such as the Mesoamerican or Egyptian and of scriptless primitive societies, whose mythologies are just as valuable as that of the Hindus for studying symbolic thought but more open to idio- syncratic interpretation. The potential of contradicting almost any rigid pronouncement on sexual symbolism in particular seems inherent in Hindu thought and customs. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's analysis is a welcome disclosure of this hazard. Drawing partly upon Beck's (1978:86) affirmation that "a symbol can evoke associations in its own right; it does not depend on a system of contrasts for its meaning," she makes a thought-provoking case of her simile of highways of symbolic thought-highways that yet encourage individuals to travel whatever "scenic opposite route" they may fancy. Using a group of Hindu divine symbols with sexual connota- tions, she demonstrates this flexibility with arguments that I find substantially appealing. My disagreements with some of her Freudian speculations reflect my scepticism of that school but arouse fresh ideas con- curring with her support for Beck. The ambivalences of sexual symbolism in many of the examples she discusses are obvious. I see little need, therefore, for psychoanalytical conjectures, par- ticularly when she is intent on refuting deterministic theory. Referring to the aquatic lotus and its connections with the god- dess Laksmi, why is water envisioned as "a predominantly female" symbol? Water is personified by Laksmi and by the riverine goddess Ganga no more than the thunderstorm is per- sonified by Indra, the rain cloud by Parjanya, and the rain by the Maruts, all male deities. Other gods intimately connected with waters are Varuna, Mitra, and Agni. The riverine god- dess, Sarasvati, has a male counterpart, Sarasvat, also riverine, whose fertilizing waters are invoked in Vedic hymns simultane- ously with, and no less fervently than, those of the goddess (Macdonell 1897). At another level of abstraction, some of the Sanskrit synonyms for "water" are feminine, but others, such as jalam, ambu, ambhas, udakam, vari, and payas, are neuter. As for the lotus, this is consistently the emblem not only of Laksmi, but equally of her consort Visnu (whose icons bear a lotus in one of his four hands and one of whose epithets is aravindaksa, "lotus-eyed"); of the god Sirya (whose icon carries full-blown lotuses in each of its two hands); and of the creator god Brahma (whose epithet is padmaja, "lotus-born"). She is correct, however, in recognizing the lotus as an emblem of divinities in general. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi quite properly mentions the semantic fusions of deity names, though her assertion regarding Laks- minarayana is only a part of the story. It may be a man's name (the suffix refers to the god Visnu), but it also pays tacit homage to the goddess (Laksmi) as clearly as when a man is named after Sankari, the epithet of the wife of Siva. The usage of conjoint names is particularly rooted in Tantric traditions, but in these they reflect the supremacy of a deity's female aspect, or sakti, i.e., his female energy. Tantric rituals conceptualize the god as seated in the middle of a lotus pericarp, next to his sakti or surrounded by several of them. It is only after prolonged prayers (bija) to these females that the god's name is invoked. The supremacy of the female is evident from the Sanskrit adage Sivah saktivihinah savah ("Siva [envisioned] without his sakti is [merely] a corpse"). Tantric fJkta traditions include cult icons like the elephant-headed Ganesani (Vainayaki). This s'akti is described in one text as possessing swelling female breasts and feminine hips, but (italics mine) "he holds a golden chain in his hands" (Bhattacharya 1966:265). On the other hand, Vedic traditions leave little room for se- mantically unresolvable subtleties like these. Vedic male deities are unquestionably male, and they dominate the pantheon totally. Even so, generalization is hazardous: The sexual indi- viduality of the primordial parental divinities, the male Dyaus ("Heaven") and the female Prthvi ("Earth"), is often merged in some Vedic hymns, while in others both are spoken of as females or "mothers" (Agrawala 1972 :2). Thus today the transsexual symbolism of the Hindus-shaped by historical factors no less than by obscure psychological drives-results from an amalga- mation of a Dravidian heritage (which emphasizes chthonic and mother-goddess cults), Tantric ideology, Vedic myths, and Upanisadic-Vedantic monistic philosophy. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi invokes a trite psychoanalytical tenet by opining that, worldwide, the serpent's various male associa- tions may be "reinforced by the image of the snake bite, sug- gestive of the perils of sex." Whether particular individuals or entire societies actually envision such an association, consciously or subconsciously, seems to me moot. In any case, it is a highly subjective, unconfirmable Freudian guess. The "scenic opposite route" in respect to the lingam can lead us to unexpected views: Sculptures of a series of nine planetary deities, the navagrahah, normally represent males and are anthropomorphic, the temple of Citracala, in Assam, being unique in depicting them all as phalli draped with identifying colored cloths. Yet in cases elsewhere, one of the group, Ketu, figures as a female, partly serpent- and partly human-bodied Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980</page><page sequence="16">(Mitra 1965:18, 20). Labyrinthine Hindu iconography offers no confirmation of the Freudian view that weapons are not con- ceivable as female sexual symbols or hollow objects as male, though long, straight, and solid objects are considered to be apt phallic symbols. Of the emblems carried by deities (and per- sonified for worship under the generic term ayudha purusa), the war club (gada), the spear (sakti), and the axelike missile heli are conceptualized as females, while the hollow conch shell (saiiha), despite its highly suggestive vagina-like cleft and ventral profile, is conceptualized as male. By contrast, the arrow (baza), the discus (cakra), and the lotus (padma) are eunuchs (Gopinatha Rao 1914:287-90). The belief that "while examples confirming Freudian theory could have been multi- l)lied ad libitum it would be more difficult to find new cases contradicting psychological assumptions" seems both ques- tionable and statistically unproductive. The implications of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's theme extend beyond Hinduism. The Shuswap Indians (of the southern interior plateau of British Columbia) attach special significan- ces to numerous species of plants. Palmer (1975 :42-43) reports that these are chosen as symbols in diverse myths and taboos and used for medicinal purposes. Certain species are linked primarily to men and others to women. For example, the cinquefoil's (Potentilla anserina) roots are considered female, but those of the bisquit plant (Lomatium macrocarpum) are male. The Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is regarded as bisexual. The Shuswap may have their own rationalizations, but Freudians will probably interpret them anew on their behalf. The interchangeability of the sexual significances Hindus some- times attach to trees and the custom of marrying male and female trees have a Shinto parallel: Sakaki trees are sacred in Japan, and those growing very close to each other near shrines are often literally tied in wedlock by means of a stout rope. Freudian sentiments are not of much help in explaining such customs. "As the trunk of a tree is usually long and solid," says Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi, "it would seem well suited to becoming a Freudian phallic symbol, and trees often do evoke a male association." Yet "female" tree trunks are no different in form; nor is there proof for her assertion that femininity is assigned to trees "less frequently" and may result from symbol-suggesting arboreal characteristics other than the trunk. A mural from Egypt representing a sycamore fig tree (what is the sex of the testicle-like fig?) illustrates this more eloquently than words can (fig. 1). An example of divine sexual transformation that occurred under conditions quite different from the Indian is found in the ancient Near East. The general Semitic deity Ishtar (identified with the archetypal Sumerian Inanna) had a multiplicity of symbolic attributes and was regarded as female. In Mari, hymns refer to a bearded Ishtar, so the possibility exists that this deity was originally bisexual or of varying or indeterminate sex. Philologically, her name, together with some of her attributes, can be traced back through Eshtar to cAttar and its variants. In Ugaritic myths, there is both a female cAthart and a male cAthar cAriz. In southern Arabia, on the other hand, cAttar or Astar was strictly a male deity, worshipped up to the Islamic era (Jacobsen 1976:140; Ringgren 1973:59; Ryckmans 1951: 41). Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's psychoanalytic predilections do not invalidate her main argument. They seem, however, to cast doubt on the usefulness of conjectures about symbolism that are beholden to the psychoanalytic precepts of the Freudian, Jungian, Adlerian, or similar schools-particularly if one sympathizes, as I do, with Eysenck's (1978) attack on their credibility. Writings involving psychoanalysis, he says, are unscientific and "characterized in general by premature crystal- lisation of spurious orthodoxies." That is, they carry a high risk of misinterpretation. The symbol-making propensities of the human mind seem to have little rhyme or reason. Moreover, they are complicated by FIG. 1.

Anyone who holds that hidden "meanings" of symbols and the motivations for particular choices are amen- able to systematic explanation and generalization is bound to encounter formidable contradictions. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's well-chosen simile of scenic opposite routes, more than that of highways, suggests caprice quite accurately. by JACOB PANDIAN Department of Anthropology, California State University, Fullerton, Calif. 92634, U.S.A. 31 v 79 The author's discussion of interchangeability sheds much light on the multidimensional, multivocal dialectics in the use of symbols, but it appears to me that from the data presented it is impossible to conclude that there is any less arbitrariness or context-boundedness in symbolization. In the absence of a comprehensive statement of the function of "the scenic opposite route" and its importance in symbolization, this study corres- ponds to Frazer's compilation of data to demonstrate the operation of magical thinking at certain levels of cultural development. Although the author explains what she means by contextual interchangeability, there is some confusion as to how and whether the various historical, social, and regional levels of context interface or merge in all or some of the mythological and ritual contexts in Hindu India as a whole. For example, she notes that the bhakti and gakti traditions are conducive to con- ceptualizing reversals and that monistic philosophy may facili- tate certain kinds of abstract reductionism; she also indicates that Hinduism in general may predispose believers toward greater freedom in the interchangeability of male and female symbols and that, in her view, only some Hindus can travel the ''narrowest and steepest scenic opposite route.'' She also makes references to certain regional contexts, and her data are to a large extent from the Dravidian south. Egnor (1978) has pointed to a contrast between the Sans- kritic and the Tamil cultural traditions in terms of the emphasis on the dominance of male or female principles. and this raises 60 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM the question whether it is accurate to assume the existence of a religious perspective relating dominance and maleness. in Hindu India as a whole. According to Egnor (1978:174-75), Sanskrit culture is male-dominated: the male is the locus of purity and the center of ritual. Tamil culture (as embodied in T. [the in- formant]) is female-dominated: the female is the locus of purity and the center of ritual. In Sanskrit the self purusa is male and the body prakrti is female. In Tamil the self uyir is female and the body al is male. In Sanskrit power is hard (so semen is called a" hard" substance and the teacher is guru, "heavy"); in Tamil power is soft. In light of Egnor's interpretation and in terms of particular historical and social contexts, an analysis of the data from Tamil culture might show that the Tamils are not involved in "the scenic opposite route." For example, a biography of the Tamil poet and political activist Bharati might indicate that he used certain symbols to generate certain sociopolitical consequences; the symbolism of Tamil films, in general, has political impli- cations, and such symbolism usually occurs in association with Tamil cultural nativism, symbolizing familial experience as an expression of the purity of motherhood; a historical study of the Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan might show it engaging in the revival, review, and interpretation of certain mythological representations which had little significance for a large num- ber of Tamil-speaking non-Brahmins in order to engender a consciousness of Sanskritic Hinduism; and the "prize-winning student" from Nagercoil may have had a certain type of cul- tural experience by virtue of the fact that she was from Kann- yakumari district, which was for over two centuries part of the Malayalam-speaking, matrilineal, Nayar kingdom of Travan- core, making it possible that no principle of interchangeability and reversal operated in her conception of Nagercoil as a place where Nagaramman ("snake-mother") resides. by GEOFFREY SAMUEL Department of Sociology, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, N.S.W. 2308, Australia. 27 v 79 The main problem I find with Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's paper is the lack of clarity regarding the nature of symbolism. In this respect Sperber (1975), a book she cites in passing, might have provided a useful basis for argument, whether or not his con- clusions are accepted in full (cf. Samuel 1977). I suspect that the vague use of "symbol" in her paper conceals that the sym- bolic statements she discusses are of two rather different kinds. The association between cow and linigam or between breast and linigam is surely of a different order to that between cow and female, breast and female, or lifigam/phallus and male. It is not so much that we are temporarily switching from the "highway" of breast = female to the "scenic route" of breast male as that the breast, with its female association, is being associated or equated with the lifigam, which remains male. To draw a parallel with a more familiar myth, the virgin birth of Jesus has significance precisely because virgins in general do not give birth. The myth does not deny the paradox; it stresses it. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's myths too seem to gain much of their point precisely from the paradoxical nature of the assertions made (cf. Sperber [1975:3-4] on the paradoxical nature of symbolic statements in general). Such a distinction might help clarify the problem of context which arises throughout the paper. Lifigam = male is context- independent, or, more precisely, its context is that of Hindu culture as a whole; lifigam = breast occurs in the context of one particular myth. This helps to rescue the structuralists from Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's strictures. It also leaves them (and anyone else with appropriate techniques) with a job to do, since it is now possible to ask what the statement means in its context in this particular myth, a question that Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi generally evades. Some of the other examples (e.g., trees and snakes) are of a different type. Here the problem is perhaps only that the Indians do not systematically make the correct Freudian associations. Snakes are simply not consistently male (or fe- male) in Hindu thought. This may be a problem for Freudian psychoanalysts, but I do not see why it should worry anthro- pologists (or Hindus) unduly. However, Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi has brought forward some fascinating material in this paper, and it is good to see the wealth of local mythology in India being submitted to anthro- pological analysis. by DAN SPERBER 33, rue Croulebarbe, 75013 Paris, France. 18 Iv 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's evidence, in spite of its intrinsic inter- est, does not warrant her conclusions. Freud held that a symbol is, apart from its varied conscious associations, always associated with the same unconscious thought, which constitutes its meaning. Levi-Strauss holds that the meaning of symbois is provided not by their explicit associa- tions, but by implicit patterns of associations which can only be discovered by looking at whole symbolic systems. Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi offers an account of essentiallv conscious and explicit associations of Hindu symbols. That these associations do not always conform to what Freud says of unconscious ones or Levi-Strauss of implicit ones is no evidence against their views. Incidentally, the same data could have been used against Freud's view in another way: as the author herself suggests, it is remarkable how often conscious associations do resemble what Freud says of unconscious ones. Since the same associa- tions cannot very well be simultaneously conscious and un- conscious, Freud seems to be right in the wrong place, i.e., wrong, though interestingly so. I have argued that none of the many explicit, implicit, and unconscious associations of "symbols" are meanings: the per- ception of a symbol is not mentally replaced by the representa- tion of an associate, as it would be if symbolic associations were true semantic relationships; rather, associations are extensions of symbols and equally open to interpretation. Eichinger Ferro- Luzzi maintains, on the contrary, that, since the associations she describes are stable and largely independent of the context, they constitute proper meanings. Without an acceptable defi- nition of "meaning," however, this is an empty claim; with such a definition it would still be a non sequitur, since stability and autonomy may be necessary conditions but certainly not suffi- cient ones for a relationship to be one of meaning. by HOWARD F. STEIN Departm6nt of Family Practice, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Okla. 73190, U.S.A. 24 Iv 79 Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's ethnographic tour de force of Hindu religion's "highways," "scenic routes," and "scenic opposite routes" takes us everywhere but to the Royal Road to the Unconscious, Indian and panhuman. Symbols are of course arbitrary, which fact Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi documents exqui- sitely, but this does not refute a rigid psychic determinism. Yet the only way to get at the emic meaning of Hindu symbols is through the sequence of associations made by informants, not by observing, from without, kinship systems, language, and religion. One simply cannot make automatic inferences about psychological reality from the normative, ideological, symbolic, which is to say "cultural," levels. One can indeed discern in cultural texts unconscious themes and fantasies, but one can construct a sound interpretation from these impressions only through the intensive and intimate study of representative persons, so-called personal documents, and the associations to which they lead us. Four exemplary works that come immedi- Vol. 21 * No. 1 - February 1980 61</page><page sequence="18">ately to mind are La Barre (1969), Erikson (1958), Koenigsberg (1975), and Stierlin (1976). I am disturbed that, while the manifest communication of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's paper is the interpretation of Hindu religious symbolism, the metacommunication is an attempt to disprove Freudian psychology. Using an Indianist metaphor, how often is it necessary to beat a dead snake? Or to set up a straw Freud? From a reading of this paper, one would think that Freud had never revised his thinking or that subsequent analytic research from Karl Abraham to Theodor Reik to Otto Rank to Ernest Jones had given us no new insights. Freud in Totem and Taboo (1914) may rightly be faulted for a decidedly Lamarckian view of how the primal murder of Laius by Oedipus is inherited as part of the racial memory. He subsequently learned, however, by listening to his patients, that even well- remembered childhood events were fantasies and not always reality. In the hands of anthropologists who, defensively it appears, have an axe to grind with regard to psychoanalytic psychology. Freud becomes an authoritarian conceptual tyrant, and all later clinical and ethnographic research is cavalierly dismissed. That the Baining of New Ireland classify the tape recorder as female because it is a hollow receptacle does not mean that they "think in psychoanalytic categories." What it does mean is that careful psychoanalytic investigation would reveal why the Baining perceive the tape recorder to be femi- nine. It is one thing for Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi to insist that meaning is subjective rather than objective, but quite another for her to stop precisely where the next stage of work ought to begin: determining why a particular subjective meaning is assigned to a neutral object. In yet another misreading of Freud, she writes mistakenly that "Freud himself has created a bisexual symbol, speaking of the 'phallic mother,' an alleged product of infantile fanta- sies." To begin with, Freud did not create the phallic mother, but discovered this terrifying castrated-female-with-the-penis fantasy in his patients; the phallic mother is not a symbol, but an experienced reality; and finally, the experience in its awe- some vividness can scarcely be called "alleged." While "male and female symbols and associations are interchanged with total disregard of Freudian theory and even anatomical dis- tinction," I would want to know more about Hindu family dynamics and child development to understand how such interchangeability comes about and, moreover, the consequen- ces of specific bisexual fantasies not only for Hindu cosmology, but for daily life. To conclude: Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi has offered some tanta- lizing ethnographic material, but she departs from her high- ways and scenic routes onto a veritable detour in her polemic asides battling with a phantom Freud. Reply by GABRIELLA EICHINGER FERRo-Luzzi Rome, Italy. 28 viii 79 "Allen Leuten recht getan ist eine Kunst, die niemand kann" (Pleasing everybody is an art given to none). In reading the comments on my paper I was reminded of these concluding words of the well-known story of the father, the son, and the donkey advised by various people as to which should be carried and which should walk. La Barre and Stein rebuke me for having attacked Freud too much. Bharati wishes I had done so more, and Mundkur criticizes my psvchoanalvtic predilec- tions. Mundkur would like to dispense with the "highways" and Lodrick with the "scenic opposite routes." Nevertheless, I thank all my commentators alike for their positive as well as their negative criticism. They have obDliged me to look at some questions from a different angle, pointed out elements which had escaped my notice, and made me realize where the message had not come through. The comments are so varied that in order to do justice to them all my reply would have exceeded the length of the original article. I have therefore had to make a selection and beg indulgence for some inevitable omissions. Freudian questions. The sharpest criticism is raised by adherents of the Freudian psychoanalytic school of thought. I had expected this but was surprised at their vehemence. All I did was show that Freud's three types of sexual symbols-(1) those which can stand with equal frequency for the male and female genitals, (2) those which designate one of the sexes pre- dominantly, and (3) those which are known only with a male or female meaning-must be reduced to two by merging the third with the second. McCreery reproaches me for not having men- tioned the former two and for having overlooked the fact that Freud does not rule out more abstract, nonsexual meanings of symbols. I did not see any reason for discussing these points, since the purpose of the paper was to draw attention only to inversions not foreseen by Freud. It is not true, as McCreery asserts, that of my ten sets of symbols only two are among those which Freud insisted have definite sexual referents. Freud left no doubt that the tree, as a long, stiff object, falls in the same rigidly determined category, and the snake is for him always a phallic symbol. According to Ludwig's (1947:12-13) calculation, there are 21 and 28 things which for Freud regularly symbolize the male sexual organ and the female sexual organ respectively. (Jones [1972 (1948): 110] outdoes the master when he writes: "Probably there are more symbols of the male sexual organ alone than for all other symbols taken together."') If this is so, it goes without saying that for Freud sculptured sexual organs, the linigam and the yoni, and mythological references to the female breast or the belly of a cow can at most have com- pletely abstract meanings but can never designate the oppo- site sex. La Barre accuses me of misrepresenting "the Freudian position, which does indeed stress the arbitrariness of symbols, as any reader of the standard statement by Jones (1961) would know." The following quotation from Jones (1972 [1948]: 104, italics mine) should correct his view: "A certain symbol can have two or sometimes more meanings, for instance, in dreams a room may symbolize either a woman or a womb.... But the possibility of variation in meaning is extremely limited and the noteworthy feature is its invariability in the different fields of symbolism." Here Jones can think only of the variabilit, be- tween woman and a synecdoche of woman, not of a male sym- bolic meaning for the room. As to the snake, Jones writes (p. 108, italics mine): "The idea of a snake, never consciously associated with the phallus, is regularly so in dreams, since it is one of the most constant and invariable symbols." In a footnote (p. 134, italics mine) he concedes: "Very rarely it can also symbolize the intestine and its contents but, as far as I know, nothing else." In summary he enumerates six attributes of the true sym- bol, the second of which is "constant meaning or extremely limited possibility of variation" (p. 146, italics mine). Stein reprimands me for writing as if Freud had never revised his position. Significantly, however, he mentions only revisions which do not touch the argument of my paper. The truth is that Freud did not revise his opinion on the wholly determined group of symbols, a fact which the quotations from Jones amply proves. Though critical of many of Freud's tenets, I meant to attack only one of them. My Freudian commentators, however, force me to be more outspoken than I intended to be. La Barre charges me with ignorance of the literature on "the woman with a penis" and its clinical meaning and Stein with misread- ing Freud in saying that Freud himself created a bisexual symbol, the "phallic mother." I did not intend to imply that Freud created the image ex novo; my doubt referred to his I All quotations of Jones are my translations of the Italian version based on the 1948 edition. 62 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM interpretation and generalization of this fantasy. I do not find anything "terrifying" in the image of a "phallic mother," but then I consider it not, as Stein does, as a "castrated-female- with-the-penis fantasy," but simply, as I pointed out, as an Ardhanarisvara figure with inverted signs. My lack of goose- flesh in this regard is, of course, due to the fact that I do not share the belief in the castration complex and penis envy, derived from an overestimation of male genitalia. The "phallic mother" seems to haunt McCreery as well, when he asks "Why isn't it possible, for example, for a trident which represents a goddess to be an especially potent symbol of divinity because it associates, unconsciously, male genitalia with a goddess?" I would say that it is possible but not very likely, and I find my interpretation of weapons as abstract symbols of power vested in both gods and goddesses more plausible. It receives confir- mation in the Hindu use of the term sakti for the weapon in the hand of a god and the fact that, as Mundkur pertinently points out, sakti means not only power but also spear. Both Stein and Kakar argue that Hindu child development may be responsible for Hindu symbolic associations. This is, I think, a claim which can never be proven or disproven beyond doubt, but since psychological development continues through- out life I do not see why child development should be given pride of place. Kakar suggests that the relatively greater bi- sexuality of Hindu symbolism with regard to the snake may be due to the predominance in Hindu culture of the oral rather than the phallic level of development. I have two remarks on this point: Firstly, anthropologists have happily overcome their own preoccupation with developmental sequences and have abandoned the most fantastic among them, such as Bachofen's stages of social life or Lubbock's stages of religious thought. Psychoanalysts might do well to follow their example. Secondly, the complexity and subtlety of Hindu thought strike me as scarcely infantile. Indian questions. I was pleased to see that the longest and most positive comments come from Indian scholars; I believe in the value of emic confirmations. Experts on India tend to agree with me that Indian culture predisposes to inversions and paradoxical associations. My contention, however, that these reveal an element of caprice is contested mainly by Appadurai, Khare, and Lodrick, who argue that there is no caprice because transformations and reversals are the essence of Hindu thought. I have three major objections to this view: 1. The glorification of arbitrariness, for instance, in the con- cept of Siva's sports, does not abolish arbitrariness. 2. Despite the little interest in precise definitions and boun- daries in Hindu thought, inversions and paradoxes are the exception and not the rule. I agree with Appadurai that trans- formations are very common. All avatiras fall under this cate- gory. Siva, alias the bull Nandi, is also a transformation, but I would not call it a radical one, since the sex of the deity and the animal is the same. A bull lactating like a female breast is a much more radical transformation, a paradox, and hence con- siderably rarer. The only other transsexual transformation that comes to mind immediately is Visnu = Mohini, whereas there are many parallels to Siva = Nandi in India and elsewhere. I am grateful to Mundkur for pointing out more "scenic opposite routes," in particular the conch shell as a symbol of Visnu. Though no interchangeable symbol of gods and goddesses, the conch shell conceived as male is indeed surprising from a Freudian point of view. Interestingly enough, its connexion with Visnu does not prevent it from having a female associa- tion as well. In South India the conch shell is strongly associated with milk, for instance, in the milk-pouring ceremony after the birth of a child. In a Tamil short story, milk not only crystal- lizes into a conch shell, but the latter automatically produces milk (as if it were a breast) whenever a child is born in the family (Ramamirtham 1975:174). I myself can contribute a further striking interchange of a common iconographic symbol. In the Siva temple of Avadayarkoil, Tanjore district, Siva is not represented as a liitgam, with or without yoni, but as the yonti pedestal alone (dilutaiydr in Tamil) (Census 1971: 423). Despite such additions-I said that my list did not claim to be complete-I repeat that examples contradicting the Freudian view are the "scenic opposite route" and not the "highway" and that there are certainly more snakes conceived as male symbols than as female ones, more linigas representing gods than representing goddesses, more gods appearing in the guise of a bull than of a cow, etc. Pandian denies my claim of arbi- trariness, because for him my "scenic opposite route" would be the "highway" in Dravidian South India. I am surprised that a Tamil (judging from his name) can repeat Egnor's assertions uncritically as if they were generally accepted truth and not the opinion of one informant. No student of India would deny that Sanskritic culture is more male-dominated than Dravidian culture, but it is a far cry from this relative distinction to a categoric opposition. If Tamil culture is female-dominated, one wonders why Murukan is considered the typical Tamil deity and not. for instance, goddess Mariyamman. I am sure that Pandian will agree with me that Siva is a god of Dravidian origin, but would he hold him to be less important than the various local goddesses? There are female ceremonies, of course, but would he consider sumanigali (an auspicious married woman -a Sanskrit term but almost certainly a Dravidian concept) worship on a par with the worship of Siva or Krsia? A woman's auspiciousness, it may be noted, is not intrinsic, but derived from her marriage. Given the greater concern with ritual purity and pollution in the Dravidian South than in North India and the fact that women alone bear the burden of two additional pollution periods (Pandian might like to consult my 1974 paper on this point), "the female as the locus of purity" does not sound quite right. I shall not discuss in detail the somewhat abstruse linguistic distinctions (uyir 'soul, life force' is neuter rather than feminine and normally opposed to utal 'body,' also neuter, rather than to dl 'person, male') but should like to rectify the following points: (a) Subramanya Bharati wrote both political and religious poems, and "Krishna My Mother" belongs to the latter group. (b) Some Tamil films have political implications (fewer than North Indian ones), but the snake film Our Family God definitely has not. (c) Rather than "en- gendering a consciousness of Sanskritic Hinduism," Ananda Vikatan aims to uphold traditional values, whatever their source. (d) Though Kanyakumari district used to belong to Kerala, which is more "female-dominated" than Tamilnad, this does not make the words of the student from Nagercoil less paradoxical, because she called "snake-mother" a deity known as "king of snakes." (Incidentally, this reference to snake wor- ship in the weekly cannot be attributed to Sanskritic Hindu- ism.) 3. It is true that some of the most striking paradoxes dis- cussed in my paper I called "scenic opposite routes" of symbolic thought along which perhaps only Hindus are willing to travel. This does not mean, however, that the process as such is limited to India, as Khare seems to think. (There is some mutual in- comprehension; I have not grasped his distinction between specificity and uniqueness.) As nobody seems to have been impressed by the double association of the bald head in Europe, I should like to add another example of a striking inversion from a different field. Worldwide, "white" tends to evoke posi- tive associations such as goodness and purity and "black" negative ones such as evil, impurity, and death. Again, these symbolic equations constitute only a particularly wide "high- way" and are not absolute. The "scenic opposite route" leading to a positive view of "black" is not even particularly narrow. Turner (1967: 81) has pointed out that in many African socie- ties black has auspicious connotations because of its association with rain-bearing clouds. The same association also exists in India, but I do not think that it is the only one permitting an Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980 63</page><page sequence="20">inversion of the usual negative image of black. Another possible reason may be that impurity and evil are just as much sources of power as purity and virtue and hence black may be regarded as magically potent and desirable. In addition to rain clouds, there are various other contexts in which black is not negative; in India, for instance, the black beads of the marriage necklace or the god Krsna (krsnia means "black" in Sanskrit). However, the fact that Krs.na is often painted blue shows that the positive associations of black do not go very far. A negative association of white is more difficult to conceive and apparently absent in India. The Konso of Ethiopia, however, choose this narrowest C"scenic opposite route." Among them white is associated with death and suggests dry animal bones (Hallpike 1972: 280). This example may also help to explain better what I mean by arbitrariness. White bones have been seen by many other people, and they will not have liked the sight, but it has not occurred to them for that reason to discredit all whiteness. Bharati and Appadurai point out that for Hindus the liftgam does not simply represent Siva but is Siva. I agree-in ritual the identity of the idol with the deity is quite obvious-and I should have mentioned this fact for completeness's sake just as I mentioned that the liigam for many Hindus is the aniconic form of Siva without any phallic connotation. However, since my paper is not about Hindu religion but about Hindu sym- bolism, since it is directed more to the anthropologist than to the believer, and since the distinction has no bearing on my argument, I shall abide by my terminology. Whereas in Hin- duism concrete identification and figurative meaning exist side by side depending on the degree of belief or the degree of philosophical sophistication of the believer (the translators of the Siva Purdna, for instance, speak of "the greatness of the phallic emblem of Siva" (Kunst and Shastri 1970: chap. 5), in Western religion such latitude is not permitted. The contro- versy between Luther and Zwingli was precisely on the question of such a distinction. For Zwingli the wine and the Host stood figuratively for the blood and body of Christ; Luther insisted that they were concretely so, and this confirmed the split into two sects. Mundkur and Lodrick comment on tree symbolism. I was delighted at Mundkur's picture of the arboreal breast-feeding Isis. Such a picture does not come as a surprise to me. I wrote, in fact, that with regard to the earlier examples offered traffic on the "scenic opposite route" is still fairly dense in India and elsewhere. The female association of the sycamore fig is prob- ably due to the choice of the latex rather than the shape of the fig for analogy. As to the peepal tree, I clearly stated that it can be seen as male or female, and therefore it is not at all certain that the women circumambulating it conceive it as "the Great Mother." (Incidentally, the kapittha tree cannot be identified with the cashew; the latter was introduced into India at the time of the Portuguese.) Given the interchangeability of male and female associations of the peepal, it seems to me that noth- ing is to be gained by tracing the latter back to the Indus Valley civilization or Mesopotamia; doing so does not eliminate the element of caprice in the choice of the characteristic for associa- tion. Campbell and Bharati would have liked me to extend my snake examples. Unfortunately, Indian snake svmbolism is so rich that complete coverage would have filled at least a whole article, and therefore I had to make choices. Kuwdalini, the snake power mentioned by Campbell, is another female associa- tion (pace Freud and Jones) of the snake in India (Avalon 1931:6). Bharati wonders whether the metaphor nagarajaruipa did not find its way into Tamil lore. I have not come across it in temple legends, but it is certainly present in modern Tamil literature. Jeyakanthan (1975:69), for instance, speaks of "a tress like a black snake" and Ramamirtham (1975 :161) of "the viperlike blackness of the hair." Women have long hair, and therefore the metaphor comes to mind more readily with regard to them, but in my view it is more the waviness and color of the hair which suggest the metaphor than a definite association with woman; also, the matted hair of the mostly male ascetics may remind one of snakes. Mundkur reproaches me for invok- ing a trite psychoanalytic tenet in speaking of the snake bite as suggestive of the perils of sex. The intended emphasis of my sentence was on the greater frequency of the phallic association of the snake than its female association the world over. I did not mean to imply that all or even the majority of human beings are afraid of sex. In some people, however, such fears do exist, at least in fantasy. The myth of the vagina dentata found in tribal India and among American Indians cannot, to my mind, be interpreted otherwise. Bharati and Mundkur question that water is a "predom- inantly female symbol," enumerating several Vedic male deities connected with water. Given the preponderance of male deities in the Vedic pantheon, those in charge of water are probably also in the majority. I would hazard the guess that, worldwide, male and female supernaturals connected with water may be about evenly distributed. In fact, the latter may slightly outnumber the former because they tend to appear in the plural (the water nymphs of Greek and Germanic mythol- ogy, for instance) while their masters are in the singular. In calling water a "predominantly female symbol" I did not mean the gender of the words for water or refer exclusively to water deities; I was speaking in a more general sense. A cosmic male/ female distinction tends to associate sky and fire with man and the earth and water with woman (as "highways," but not in an absolute sense). Psychoanalysts will agree with me here, but even without enlisting their help Hindu mythology provides a good example. O'Flaherty (1973:256) speaks of "Siva with Parvati, the lingam with the yoni, and fire in water-the three images of satisfaction on the levels of the myth, the cult and the symbol." Bharati feels uncomfortable with my binary opposites of linigam and earth and linigam and water because of their lack of fit with the five element-linigas-and rightly so. In the former cases we are in the realm of binary opposites; in the latter we have left it behind. In addition to being images of satisfaction, O'Flaherty's opposites can be understood as images of totality, the whole world expressed through the conjunction of two polar opposites or salient features in a sort of shorthand. The myth of Gane?a and the mango confirms this interpretation. Ganesa wins the fruit because he quickly circumambulates his parents, Siva and Parvati, instead of travelling around the world as Murukan does. Conversely, in the concept of the five element- linigas totality or the cosmic nature of Siva is expressed in extenso, so to speak, by bringing the linigam into conjunction with every single element (I have voiced similar ideas elsewhere [1977:511-12]). The two procedures cannot be mixed-there- fore the lack of fit noticed by Bharati-though it is sometimes possible to reduce the latter to the former. Symbolism. Appadurai would have liked me to adopt Peirce's distinction between indexical, iconic, and symbolic signs, especially because the relationship between signs and their referents in Hindu religious thought would be mostly indexical and metonymic. Unfortunately, there is little agree- ment among the various authors who have proposed such terminological distinctions, and since I am unable to consult Peirce I do not know exactly what he means. His indexical sign apparently is not identical with Leach's (as smoke indicates fire; 1976:12), because in that sense none of my interchangeable symbols would be indexical. There also seems to be disagree- ment about the meanings of metonym and metaphor. In my view the tree, the snake, the white-anthill, the lotus, the wea- pon, the vessel, the cow, and the bull are all metaphors for deities; only the liingamn and the yoni are metonyms, and hence the latter are much rarer than the former. I admit that I used "means," "represents," and "is associated with" as rough equivalents, but firstly a precise distinction did not seem neces- sary for my argument and secondly in Hindu thought itself 64 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="21">Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LINGAM there are no clear boundaries, concrete identification and figura- tive representation existing side by side. Sperber also takes me to task for lack of precision and for attributing meaning to symbols without an acceptable definition of "meaning." What if "meaning" were a polythetic concept impossible to define attributionally and exhaustively? Sperber himself notices that "the word 'meaning' has so many meanings that it always fits in somehow" (1975:8-9), but nevertheless he decides to reserve it for linguistic use. I concede that there are subtle differences between linguistic meaning and symbolic meaning, but to all intents and purposes symbols mean, and I do not see any reason that the notion of meaning should be limited to linguistic meaning alone. Samuel notes that "the association between cow and linigam or between breast and lingam is surely of a different order to that between cow and female, breast and female, or lingam/ phallus and male." I perfectly agree, and I called only the former two paradoxes. He remarks that "myth does not deny the paradox; it stresses it," a point I thought to have made amply clear in my discussion of the breast = linigam myth. He even reproaches me for generally neglecting to state what such paradoxes mean, though I did give interpretations of the breast = lirigam myth and the lactating bull. This specification also partly answers Pandian's charge that without indicating the function of the "scenic opposite route" my study corresponds to Frazer's compilation of data. In my view, the breast = linigam myth has the religious function of demonstrating the excellence of the bhakti marga (the way to salvation by devotion alone) and the bull = breast myth the psychological function of reassuring people desirous of offspring. The element of caprice in the "scenic opposite route," however, makes it un- likely that functional utility can be found in all cases. Even where no function can be adduced, I do not think that my technique can justifiably be compared to Frazer's, since I have discussed my interchangeable symbols and paradoxical associa- tions in the context of a culture I am familiar with. Jarvie argues that anything can be associated with anything else on condition that a theory can be formulated that connects the two. I agree up to a point and have myself proposed three such theories. The tree examples correspond to Theory 1, the selection of different characteristics for association. The snake, the anthill, the ithyphallic yogi, and the bald head correspond to Theory 2, the same characteristic seen from different per- spectives. Weapons, vessels, the linigam, the now added yoni, and the term "mother" correspond to Theory 3, sexual opposi- tion transcended in a common denominator. The bull = breast, the breast = lingam, and perhaps the cow's belly = liigam I take for a subgroup of Theory 3. The associations in these cases are due to a common denominator, but, at least in the former two instances, the sexual connotation is not transcended; on the contrary, the resulting paradox is exploited for cultural pur- poses. The linigam = cow, the cow = -salagrdma, and the lotus = liigam, however, do not correspond to any theory, as far as I can see. The only thing shared by the two elements brought into conjunction is their cultural value (for a similar observa- tion on cultural value's being responsible for the inclusion in a concept of elements which logically do not belong there, see Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi n.d.). Caprice lies in the selection of the characteristic and the perspective as well as in the invention of the paradox. Jarvie further proposes two main possibilities accounting for the popularity of a theory. The first, that "a theory diffuses because of its coherence with other theories," I accept but hold to be more applicable to scientific theories than to symbolic associations. If Darwin's "survival of the fittest" is accepted as dogma, all subsequent theories of physiological and cultural selective advantages make beautiful sense. Conversely, my three theories do not depend on any coherence with other theories. Jarvie's second possibility, that "a theory diffuses because of its success," seems obscure to me. I cannot think of any example confirming his assertion that "a theory that suc- cessfully explains and predicts phenomena and facilitates the development of effective technology opens the way for symbolic associations." My interchangeable symbols certainly do not fall into this category. No theory that explains or predicts snake bite or facilitates the extraction of snake venom can reasonably lead to a male or female association of the snake. De Leeuwe states that symbols and structures are not innate, but acquired and learned. My similes of "highway," "scenic route," and "scenic opposite route" were precisely an attempt to tackle this vexed problem. Symbolic associations are not innate in the sense that we cannot help making them, since we have the choice of "scenic routes" and "scenic opposite routes"; nevertheless, there is a pronounced tendency to prefer some to others. I cannot see how structures can be derived from experi- ence, and while I agree that the majority of symbolic associa- tions are learned I argue that not all of them are. For instance, innumerable symbols are based on the concept of the warm color red and the cold color blue (an intuition confirmed by the places of red and blue on the wave spectrum). I would call blood the prototype of red in nature, but blood is no warmer than urine and mother's milk. Since we are likely to see and feel the latter earlier and more frequently than the former, if experi- ence were responsible yellow and white would be the warm colors rather than red. I would call the sky the prototype of blue in nature. Since the sky, however, is bluest when the sun shines and is not particularly cold, the coldness of the color blue cannot be based on experience. I suspect that the coldness of green is not based on experience either, though the presence of green, i.e., vegetation, corresponds to relative coolness in most parts of the world except the Arctic. In order to decide the question I should like to know the Eskimos' idea of green. I have more serious reservations about De Leeuwe's attempt to link the choice of male and female symbolic associations to social structure, the social position of the sexes, and the level of the productive forces. It is hardly possible to conclude from the more frequent interchangeability of male and female sym- bols in India than in the West that Indian society is more egalitarian than Western society, and I do not think that the phallus has acquired female associations in the Soviet Union now that women drive tractors and work in mines. Structuralism. McCreery wonders where I discovered that structuralism stresses the arbitrariness of all symbols. I admit that the sentence as it stands and taken out of context may give rise to misunderstanding. Both psychoanalysts-Jung more than Freud, as La Barre rightly points out-and structuralists are determinists, but their determinism is of different nature. For Freud it is the sexual meaning of a number of symbols that is determined; for the structuralists it is the underlying struc- ture. Symbols may take on various meanings according to their place in the structure in relationship to other symbols. Their meaning is thus not determined once and for all and arbitrary in that sense. Saussure (1968 [1916]:91) raises the arbitrary character of the linguistic sign to the status of a principle. Levi-Strauss (1955:51) espouses this view, adapting it to his interpretation of mythological thought and opposing it to Jung's "archetypes" and a certain psycholinguistic school of thought. Even a sexual symbol like hair, Hershman (1974:292) argues, can be used to signify nonsexual values in the social context. Samuel seeks to rescue the structuralists from my strictures, pointing out that the linigam = breast occurs in only one myth and hence is context-dependent, while the context of the lingam = male is that of Hindu culture as a whole. In reply I should like to repeat that just as I never intended to refute the whole of Freud's theory of symbolism, so I never intended to contest the importance of context for symbolic meanings; I only wanted to show that context is not always relevant. My campaign is Vol. 21 * No. 1 * February 1980 65</page><page sequence="22">directed against absolute mental and cultural laws, not neces- sarily against tendential ones. I drew attention to the fact that the peepal tree may be seen as male or female according to its conjunction with other trees and that the snake in the Tamil film was called "mother" or "king" in different contexts. On the other hand, the context of the linigam = male (or, rather, ex- clusively male) is not the whole of Hindu culture, but only the greater part of it. In exactly the same context of temple worship Saiva couples are paradoxically represented by two linigas or two combined linigam-yoni idols in Maharashtra, while elsewhere one linigam or one combined idol occurs. Linguistic questions. I was amused by Bharati's Western parallel to my Indian verbal fusion of male and female elements. Minaksisundaresvara and similar names, however, are more striking, since they contradict the near universal that the mas- culine gender is extended to include the feminine and not vice versa (since this is a linguistic near universal, Whorf need not be invoked). I am sure that English-speakers would not toler- ate "Mr. and Mrs. Mary Williams." La Barre reproaches me for espousing the idea that true mental universals exist only in language and the related field of kinship systems and terminologies-which would by no means represent standard opinion among linguists. Campbell would have liked me to be more explicit on this subject. I do not know whether all linguists accept Greenberg's (1968:145) several hundred universals, but nobody can deny, I think, "that every language contains some nonempty class of phonetic seg- ments with the feature of consonantality and some such class with the feature of vocality" (pp. 139-40) or that there does not seem to exist a kinship terminology in which "father and mother's brother are covered by a single kin term, while the father's brother is given a separate name" (Greenberg 1970: 108). If exceptions were to be found I would welcome them because another bit of absolute determinism would have to go, but the chances are very slim that this will happen. Khare raises the important point that the linguistic meaning of the term linigam may have opened the way to an inversion of its iconographic meaning. It is true that both Sanskrit and Tamil dictionaries give the first meaning of the term as "sign, symbol, token" and only the second or third meaning as "Siva's phallus." It can be argued that the term passed from the com- pletely abstract to the nonspecifically sexual, as in grammatical gender, to its specifically male connotation. Despite the dic- tionary meaning (is it certain that the term linigam is originally Sanskrit?), I have argued the other way round-from the specific to the general, from the sex-bound to the abstract- because of the much more frequent use of the linigam as Sivalifi- gam than as the symbol of other deities and because of the first association evoked by the term linigam, which is certainly Siva. The unconscious. The controversial problem of the uncon- scious cuts across the disciplines of psychoanalysis and struc- turalism and is taken up in particular by Stein and Sperber. Stein criticizes me for arriving at the emic meaning of Hindu symbols from without. Observation, the questioning of infor- mants, and the consultation of written material are discounted, the only way of arriving at a sound interpretation being "through the sequence of associations made by informants," hence a psychoanalytic study. I have two objections to this view: (1) Idols and symbols occurring in legends are not strictly personal creations. Levi-Strauss has remarked that through oral transmission the accidental elements of a myth are eliminated and only the crystalline parts remain. I think a similar process occurs at the level of the individual symbol. Purely personal symbolic meanings would not find currency in a legend, and the purely personal whims of a sculptor would not be tolerated in an idol, which has to be approved by the temple authorities and also indirectly by the worshippers. An intimate study of repre- sentative persons might reveal either the same associations as ordinary fieldwork or private ones which might blur the picture. (2) I question the necessary opposition between conscious and unconscious themes and fantasies. Stein is so deeply persuaded of the necessary opposition between apparent and hidden, explicit and implicit, that he even finds it in my paper. He writes: "I am disturbed that, while the manifest communication of Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi's paper is the interpretation of Hindu religious symbolism, the metacommunication is an attempt to disprove Freudian psychology." I would remind him that I stated quite explicitly that the main purpose of my paper was to refute the rigid part of Freudian determinism with the help of Hindu examples. The interpretation of Hindu religious sym- bolism would have required book space. Sperber is equally convinced of the irreducible opposition between conscious and explicit associations and unconscious and implicit ones and asserts that, since I offer the former and Freud and Levi-Strauss are concerned with the latter, my evi- dence is not conclusive. The argument that the same associa- tions cannot be simultaneously conscious and unconscious con- tains a serious flaw. They cannot be so in the individual, but they may very well be in different individuals in the same community. For India I mentioned the case, confirmed by Bharati, of the phallic connotation of the linigam, conscious in some Hindus but not in others. Leach (1958:155) has made the same observation: "in South India and Ceylon 'explicit' and 'displaced' phallic symbols are used side by side." He speaks of unconscious symbols as "displaced," since he is convinced as I am that what is unconscious need not be repressed. Conclusion. I should like to make a few more remarks on my similes of "highways," "scenic routes," and "scenic opposite routes" of symbolic thought. My paper is primarily concerned with the latter and intended to make a case for an element of caprice in symbol formation, with the object of refuting rigid mental determinism. I have insisted on "an element of caprice" because the "scenic opposite route" is mentally tied to the "highway" and hence not altogether free. Just as I am intrigued by the "scenic opposite routes"-the "scenic routes" are ade- quately explained by context-so I am intrigued by the exis- tence of mental "highways," i.e., the extraordinary predomin- ance of certain ways of thinking over other equally possible ones. "Highways" are not only found in symbolic thought. I have called our tendency to think in binary categories another "highway" because in making classifications there are also "scenic routes," though no "scenic opposite route." One such "scenic route" would be a triple division-not just two ex- tremes and a mediator or a redundant addition to a pair of opposites, which leave the binary principle intact, but the triple groupings so popular in folktales or the triads which cannot, or can only with difficulty, be reduced to dyads. In the Hindu trimurti, the preserver mediates between the creator and the destroyer; in the Christian Trinity the Holy Spirit does not so obviously mediate, since the Father and the Son are not opposites, and considering its little importance in comparison to the other two terms it seems to have been added mainly for the sake of the triad. Another "scenic route" of classification would be the pentad favoured in India. The ideal of the pentad is also often achieved at the cost of some artifice, for instance, in the five products of the cow, which could be easily augmented (Eichinger Ferru-Luzzi 1977:513), or in the five activities of Siva, in which conferring grace and hiding seem to serve mainly to complete the number five. "Highways" of thought also exist in wrong assumptions falsifiable even without advanced tech- nology and statistics. One example is the belief in the harmful effects of menstrual blood. Though no inevitable thought, it exists in the majority of communities all over the world. It does not depend on the level of civilization, because it is absent among the "wild" Veddas least influenced bv the Sinhalese (Seligmann and Seligmann 1969[191 1]: 139) while anthropolo- gist Neumann (1977:414) still clings to it. Another example is the belief that snakes love milk, occurring in a great number of 66 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="23">Eichlnger Ferro-Luzzi: THE FEMALE LiNGAM communities at various levels of civilization despite its intrinsic unlikeliness.
