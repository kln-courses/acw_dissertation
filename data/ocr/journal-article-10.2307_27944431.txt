<plain_text><page sequence="1">Response to Critics Gordon D. Kaufman / Harvard Divinity School Foreword Before I begin my response to these five excellent papers, I must express my gratitude to those who have made possible this issue of AJTP. First, I want to thank Jennifer Jesse and Wesley Robbins, the editors, for largely devoting this issue to examination of my two recent books In the beginning . . . Creativity1 and Jesus and Creativity2 and then selecting such a fine group of theologians/philosophers, representing a range of perspectives, to assess critically the theological proposals sketched in these books. Second, I am greatly indebted to the five writers David Conner, Randall Auxier, Nancy Howell, Wesley Wildman, and Edgar Towne for their sympathetic examinations of the positions I have laid out, bringing to light significant issues and problems that need further attention. My thanks to all of you. In these two books I continue to develop my proposal that we today, instead of assuming God is a person-like Creator, should think of the ongoing massive serendipitous creativity, manifest throughout the universe the creativity in the Big Bang, in the 14 billion years of evolutionary development of which the sciences speak, and the amazing human creativity that has emerged on planet Earth as God.3 This suggestion is elaborated further in In the beginning . . . Creativity (hereafter IBC). And in Jesus and Creativity (hereafter J&amp;C), I show it implies that the terms in which Jesus has been traditionally understood ("son of God," "word of God," "God's messiah," "second person of the trinity," and so on), all now need to be replaced if Jesus is to be understood in terms of the conception of God as creativity. Much creativity is displayed in the Jesus-story, of course a story beginning 1 Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2004. 2 Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2006. 3 This proposal is a central theme in my book In Face of Mystery: A Constructive Theology (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993; hereafter IFOM). I believe my first public use of the idea of creativity in this theological way is to be found in my book Theology for a Nuclear Age (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1985; and Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1985), 41 and 45. See also 84, n.12 below, for a brief sketch of my early use of the word "creativity."</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 77 with Jesus' baptism, ministry, and crucifixion; continuing on with the emergence of the disciples' creative insights and understandings in connection with their new-found belief in Jesus' "resurrection"; later on his followers creative rethinking of how human life should be lived, and their profoundly creative new notion that "God is love" (1 John 4); and the ongoing creativity of the Jesus-movement throughout history all the way down to the present. How should one organize in a single essay a response to five quite disparate and complex examinations of the theological and philosophical concerns that surround these proposals? It was impossible to examine all the issues raised by each writer: too many significant issues, from too many quite diverse points of view, are raised in these articles. So I have chosen to take up only one or two major themes or problems in each of the five essays: (1) David Conner's assessment of my proposed theological terminology; (2) Randall Auxier's belief that I have capitulated too much to scientism; (3) Nancy Howell's many questions; (4) Wesley Wildman on my naturalism and creativity; (5) Edgar Towne on God-as-creativity. I am sorry, of course, that I have to pass over many important matters. The overall result of this outline, however, has been somewhat serendipitous: assessments of a number of major themes in my work are presented here in a sequence that brings out some important problems, and I am thus given an opportunity to develop my thinking further on these matters. These writers all addressed themselves to issues, in IBC, concerning my proposal that God be understood as creativity. In addition, two of them explored some of the christological ideas proposed in J&amp;C (and a third made some references to that book). Randall Auxier seems to agree somewhat with my judgment that the conception of God (in IBC) is inadequate and incomplete,4 and he doubts my christological efforts can save it (Auxier, 22).5 He thinks I describe "an impersonalist Jesus" (Auxier 18), and he thus misses completely the significance of the "Jesus-story" I tell the most important and distinctive feature of the christology in J&amp;C. The lack of attention in these articles to this christology is unfortunate for at least two reasons: (1) Jesus plays at least as important a role as God in most Christians' faith, life, and experience. This is 4 J&amp;C, 22-24. 5 The parenthetical page references in Kaufman's response are to the critical essays appearing earlier in this issue (the editors).</page><page sequence="3">78 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy because (as is emphasized throughout J&amp;C) the image/concept of Jesus humanizes in many ways, and makes present and alive to us men and women, the significance and attractiveness of God's (creativity's) relationship to humanity, and God's love for humanity. For most Christians, thus, Jesus is an important vehicle undergirding faith in God: in the Christian tradition it is Jesus, after all, who is the savior that brings new life, hope, and salvation. So God is not properly understood, in Christian faith, if the significance of Jesus is not taken into account. (2) A God imagined as the creativity manifest throughout the vast cosmos in which we today find ourselves may well seem much more distant, abstract, severe, than the Creator-God of traditional Christianity. That God, after all, was imagined as human-like in many profound respects that do not obtain for creativity as such. Thus, when creativity becomes the defining image/concept in terms of which God is understood, the role of Jesus becomes even more important. For Christians, I argue, the existential and religious significance of God-as creativity becomes most evident and clear largely in and through the Jesus-story. Since this importance of Jesus for my overall theological program is not carefully examined in any of the articles being considered here, I have felt it necessary to conclude my remarks with an Afterword on Jesus and Creativity in which important texts in J&amp;C are directly quoted. Without J&amp;C the religious viability of my proposal that God be understood as creativity is greatly reduced. I. David Conner's Assessment of My Proposed Theological Terminology David Conner presents a very careful summary and assessment of my book, In the beginning. . . Creativity (Conner, 1-10), and he examines the theological terminology elaborated in it sympathetically and thoughtfully. He quotes approvingly my remark that "The metaphor of creativity ... is appropriate for naming God because (1) it preserves and indeed emphasizes the ultimacy of the mystery that God is, even while (2) it connects God directly with the coming into being in time of the new and the novel" (5f).6 He goes on to say that 6 Quoted by Conner from IBC, 511</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 79 The recognition that creativity is innately mysterious is a wholesome corrective to various forms of theological absolutism and wishful thinking, and further, it accounts for Kaufman's adjectival use of the word serendipitous. The point is . . . that the creative trajectories which produce and sustain us are, at bottom, largely unfathomable. Kaufman's use of the term serendipity may be understood as a way of circumventing any endorsement of the type of teleology which envisions the source of creativity as a deliberative divine agent or a purpose-laden, cohesive process (6).7 To explain creativity further, Conner describes what I call its three principal modalities: "(1) the initial coming into being of the universe, usually referred to as the 'big bang'; (2) the subsequent physical historical processes that over the eons have eventually produced complexity and life; and (3) the type of creativity that is associated specifically with human beings, which involves the use of mental processes and symbols" (Conner 7). And he notes that "Kaufman . . . attributes no unity or coherent ontological structure to these forms of creativity, but instead maintains unswervingly that serendipity and mystery are requisite terms reflecting the unavoidable limitations of our knowledge. Serendipity and mystery . . . serve ... to deepen our religious sensibility concerning creativity" (7).8 In all of this he has 7 For rather different judgments of mystery, see Conner llf, and 16 (quoted below on 80); also see 85fand 92f. 8 Conner has interpreted my use of the terms "serendipity," "mystery," and "creativity" quite accurately. Wesley Wildman gives a different reading. "In Jesus and Creativity" he says, "Kaufman apparently intends to clarify his thinking on the relationship between creativity itself and the trajectories of creativity that are serendipitous for the human project. . . . God as creativity itself is profusely expressive and * works' along many fecund trajectories. . . . Some creative trajectories naturally support the growth of human civilization and culture, health and happiness. Others are hostile to human interests. . .. Overall, the human project is sustained by enough trajectories of creativity that we can call the creativity manifest in our own history 'serendipitous.' . . . Serendipitous creativity is a part of God (as creativity itself) but not all of God. ... God as creativity itself is a morally perplexing religious concept, at best, and at worst it ought to be utterly repudiated as morally disastrous for human affairs" (Wildman, 57 58; discussed in detail below 97f). Nowhere do I make this distinction (Wildman cites 49 and 99-100 in J&amp;C as its source, but there is nothing in those pages to justify this distinction). I assume throughout that all creativity is serendipitous in some respects, though attempting to spell out all the various sorts of serendipity in the universe would</page><page sequence="5">80 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy presented my theological terminology accurately and sympathetically. And he sums up this portion of his remarks very generously: "In the beginning. . .Creativity is an engaging book marked by its originality, cogency, and power. Its theology is carefully argued and may be described as constructive, naturalistic, pluralistic, historicist postmodern, and practical-ethical. It is liberal in the broad sense" (10). Nevertheless, his overall assessment of the theological program that I develop with this terminology is quite negative: Kaufman's position is of questionable religious availability not because it jettisons personalism, but because of the preeminent roles it assigns to serendipity and mystery, resulting in a vision of creativity that is unnecessarily restrained in its ability to evoke morale, confidence, devotion, and reverence. . . . [T]here is little basis in his thought to uphold the conviction that non human or more-than-human creativity can function in specifiable, systemic ways as a meaningful basis for hope. Our ultimate hope, rather, must be in our own efforts, as we deliberately attempt to take advantage of a natural creativity which produces value not systematically but serendipitously. Kaufman's understanding of mystery prohibits even a provisional ontological examination of creativity. ... It is the obduracy of this mystery that leads to Kaufman's use of the word serendipitous, and it is his use of the word serendipitous that prohibits him from attributing more than a fortuitous integrity, wholeness, or value producing process to creativity, a.k.a. God (1 If, 16). be pointless. The reason I sometimes refer simply to "creativity" and other times to "serendipitous creativity" is not because they have different referents but simply to avoid boring redundancy. I do not accept Wildman's interpretation of my use of these terms. On J&amp;C, 99 (one of the pages Wildman cites in support of his view) there is a very clear statement that "Ultimately ... we must put our trust in that wider creativity deeply mysterious, but also surprisingly beneficent." My phrase here, "that wider creativity" is what Wildman refers to as "creativity itself the creativity that he wishes to repudiate as "morally disastrous for human affairs" (58). Wildman and I seem to have quite different views on this weighty matter. For further discussion of this, see my response to Wildman, 96-99, and the Afterword, 110-15.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 81 I, of course, interpret these two words in the opposite direction: it is our awareness of "the obduracy" of the mystery of life and of the world that is our principal protection from overreaching in our theological reflection, our faith, and our actions hence I refrain from developing a typology or ontology of mystery (a refusal that Conner regrets [Conner, 12-16]); however, employment of the word "serendipitous" opens up a vision of the future that is inviting and a ground for significant hope (not certainty, of course, but genuine hope) despite the obdurant mystery.9 Conner also notes that I take into consideration "chaos theory, emergent complexity, autocatalysis, and the 'self-organizing' tendencies of nature, but these ideas," he says, "are presented as bare, inexplicable facts, by which we can only be mystified even as, at the same time, we are profoundly grateful" (12). I have to admit that it is possible to understand IBC in this way, especially if one is unaware of the contents of J&amp;C, where I work out in detail the significant role that Jesus plays in my understanding of God.10 As indicated above, I will elaborate on this contention in the Afterword of this essay. Conner does not conclude his remarks, however, on as negative a note as the above quotation suggests; he is, in fact, rather laudatory: Kaufman's God is compellingly realistic in its ethical relevance, and there is no doubt that serendipitous creativity does exist. . . . [W]hen one steps back to look at Kaufman's theology as a whole, it manifests a nuance, a depth, and a strength of ethical conviction for which we can only be grateful.... What is most valuable about this book is . . . that ... it employs a straightforward method in the construction of a theological position which is remarkable for its cogency, clarity, candor, and, most of all, for its passionate hope that humanity may yet avoid decimating or destroying life on planet earth.... [T]he book has done its job (Conner, 16-17). 9 Conner regrets that I seem to close off all possibilities of even a minimalist metaphysics (Conner, 1 If, 15f). Perhaps he will be pleased, therefore, to read in my response to Randall Auxier that I am willing to say that my position does involve what he calls a "hypothetical ontology" (88, below). 10 See J&amp;C, esp. chs. 1, 2, and 4.</page><page sequence="7">82 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy . Randall Auxier's Belief That I Have Capitulated Too Much to Scientism Randall Auxier is the only writer who focused a large part of his article on J&amp;C. He opened his piece in a very complimentary way: "Jesus and Creativity is an excellent book," he says, it "is beautifully written, with an economy of language and expression that few academic writers could achieve" (Auxier, 18). Nevertheless, he does not think I offer a very promising way of reconceiving the symbol of God in today's cultural struggles. Rather, it is almost as though a general of the First World War had decided to evade the trench-lines of the enemy and no-man's land by flying to the moon instead. . . . Whether Kaufman and his brave band of astronauts have attained the moon will not in any obvious way bring peace to the culture-warriors, who are far more numerous than these astronauts (Auxier, 19). . . . [Kaufman suggests we] turn away from the blood soaked God of Abraham to "an image/concept much better fitted to encourage our coming to terms with today's massive ecological and pluralistic issues" (20).. .. [He] regards "creativity" as, if not the sole Archimedian point of future theology, one of a small handful of such ideas. . . . [His] God is not a comforter and we are warned against imagining that God has any special interest in humanity as a whole, let alone in our individual lives. We must find hope without turning to merely fabricated stories about another heavenly world in which things are better than they are here. . . . Kaufman's God does not love us or anything else. . . . This impersonal God casts Jesus in a demanding role in the cosmic story for Christians, in the sense that Jesus must somehow compensate us for a God that does not love us (2If). In this last sentence Auxier raises an important question about my version of Jesus and the Jesus-story. But his misled conviction that I</page><page sequence="8">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 83 offer only "an impersonalist Jesus" (18) eviscerates him; and thus his view of my understanding of the Jesus-story cannot supply what is needed to amplify and qualify IBC.11 Let us turn to his critique of my proposal that we today should think of God as serendipitous creativity. Auxier claims this notion is grounded more in scientistic thinking than in religious needs and ideas: Confronted with a choice between attempting to remold religion according to the standards of scientific and historical plausibility, and attempting to remold science and history according to the standards of religious plausibility, Kaufman chose the former. The principal move entailed in this decision is to render religion impersonal,12 so as to satisfy the objective sensibilities and demands of scientific and historical inquiry. ... In doing this, Kaufman genuflects to the God (Idol?) of objectivity" (Auxier, 26, emphasis added). This is obviously a negatively loaded interpretation of my project. It suggests that scientific and other academic interests and values are what drive my proposals rather than religious and other bona fide theological concerns. I do not agree with the absoluteness of Auxier's disjunction quoted here. There are at least three general considerations that, in my opinion, count against it. (1) Many different kinds of religious world pictures have appeared in human history, each providing a setting for human life in the world. Some are more reliable and supportive of ongoing human existence than others, and today as a result of the rise of the sciences in recent centuries we humans have more accurate and adequate conceptions of the world in which we live than ever before. I nowhere argue that we should adopt uncritically the modern scientific world-picture (whatever that might be); but I do insist that it is an inexcusable obstinacy or ignorance if today in our theological work 11 The Afterword will make clear what I regard as needed to accomplish this amplification. 12 The personal/impersonal issue is, I think, Auxier's major problem with my proposals. Others regard this matter as much less important. As noted above (80), David Conner states that although "Kaufman's position is of questionable religious availability," this is "not because it jettisons personalism. . . . Kaufman quite rightly, in my opinion, eschews" theological personalism (Conner, 11).</page><page sequence="9">84 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy we do not take into account what the modern sciences are able to teach us about the universe in which we live. I try to do that. (2) The word "religion" is a vague, loose, and highly contested term, applied in many different ways (often inconsistent with each other) to quite diverse aspects of human culture and life around the globe: one group's "deep religious piety" may be despised elsewhere as ignorance, fanaticism, or foolishness. Since there is no agreement on what counts as religion or religiousness, the pretentious phrase that Auxier employs, "standards of religious plausibility," has no definite meaning. Theologians must make their own best judgments about what qualifies as "religious plausibility." Some will disagree with my judgment on this matter, but it is certainly my intention to make my proposals "religiously plausible." (3) Our modern scientific knowledge has enabled us to become aware that we humans have been fouling our nest in an enormously destructive way, especially in the last century or two; and it would be weak-minded indeed if our "standards of religious plausibility" did not require us to take this into account in today's theological efforts to construct a viable religious stance. Increasing numbers of women and men around the globe are becoming convinced that we humans now have enormous problems that could bring the whole human project to an end. Surely this must be regarded as of great religious significance. My theological proposals bring these concerns to center-stage.13 13 These concerns have been a major driving force in my theological work since about 1980. In 1975 I published my Essay on Theological Method (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995 [3rd ed.]) in which I argued that theology should be understood not as essentially a hermeneutical task (that is, a matter largely of interpretation of texts, ancient and modern) but as fundamentally an activity of human "imaginative construction." This understanding of theology freed me to take up major human concerns not often thought of as "religious" or "theological" and bring them to the center of my theological work. The earliest public manifestation of this was in my 1982 Presidential Address to the American Academy of Religion (JAAR 51, No. 1 [1983] 3-14), on "Nuclear Eschatology and the Study of Religion." In that address I insisted that we "must awaken theology from its 'dogmatic slumber' so that it can address today's actual human situation . . . , [and] we must be prepared to enter into the most radical kind of deconstruction and reconstruction of the traditions we have inherited, including their most central and precious symbols, God and Jesus Christ and Tor ah" (13). Later, in the little book on Theology for a Nuclear Age (1985), some of my new theological directions began to appear, including (I believe) my earliest public use of the term creativity. "There is a hidden creativity at work in the historico-cultural process, and it is this which has given us the basic social and cultural structures which have actually created and continue to sustain human existence, as well as those qualities</page><page sequence="10">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 85 My principal theological interest is not to "remold" the Christian religion "according to the standards of scientific and historical plausibility" (Auxier, 26): I do not think those "standards" (whatever they might be) are broad enough or pertinent enough to guide the lives and communities of humanity through the maze of problems in today's world. I am interested, however, in remolding Christian faith and ethics in ways that enable them to address more effectively the most important problems facing humanity today.14 For Auxier the most fundamental problem with my position is my view (as he sees it) that God is to be understood as "wholly impersonal" (28); he reiterates this claim repeatedly throughout much of his essay.15 That is not my position, however: I contend that God is an utter mystery beyond human comprehension, and we humans, therefore, should not attempt to say just what God is or is not.16 Auxier's claim here arises from his failure to understand, and thus to take seriously, what I mean by mystery and what I mean by creativity. of life which we most deeply cherish. ... It is the creativity working in and through history that has made human life distinctively human, and it is only in hope of continuing positive effects of this creativity this unpredictable grace at work in our decisions and actions that we today can take up the heavy responsibilities thrust upon us by the prodigious growth of technology and symbolised so dramatically by our stockpiles of nuclear weapons" (41, emphases added). These thoughts can hardly be regarded as driven basically by the desire "to satisfy the objective sensibilities and demands of scientific and historical inquiry," as Auxier charged (Auxier 26, emphasis added). 14 In Theology for a Nuclear Age (1985) I was thinking about a wide range of problems that should be addressed in our theological work: "We now realize . .. that the earth has quite limited resources and if we do not move quickly toward conservation of energy, water, minerals, arable land, and so forth, human life as we know it can no longer be sustained. We are poisoning ourselves in many ways, some known to us, many unknown: the atmosphere, especially surrounding our cities, has become polluted and is dangerous to breathe; fish can no longer live in many of our rivers and lakes; the food that we eat apparently contains cancer-causing agents; 'acid rain' falls on our forests and kills the trees. It is clear that we dare no longer think in terms simply of meeting our immediate short-range needs" (30). Other similar lists of today's human problems can be found on pages 9 and 14 of that book. 15 For example: "Kaufman's impersonal God" (Auxier, 29); "God is definitely an impersonal being"; "God must be impersonal" (30); "The Jesus movement is an impersonal historical snowball rolling down the hill of time" (32); etc.. 16 Perhaps I should point out that I do not violate this rule when I propose that we think of God as creativity, because I maintain that creativity is also ultimately a profound mystery to us humans. I am proposing that with respect to these matters we think of the two words "God" and "creativity" as referring to the same mystery.</page><page sequence="11">86 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Let us consider the word "mystery" first. I do not use this word in a weak sense as meaning something like "puzzling." "Mystery" in my use is a very strong word. In IBC I state that "'mystery' (when used in a theological context) refers to the fundamental limits of all human knowledge."17 When used in connection with creativity or God, then, the word "mystery" always emphasizes our not-knowing or not understanding what we are speaking about: "we cannot grasp the idea of creation, of something coming from nothing. This remains for us a profound mystery."18 In J&amp;C we find the same kind of emphasis; for example: "Creativity is always a profound, inexplicable mystery to us humans, something we find difficult even impossible to account for: ... the coming into being of something truly novel has occurred."19 Similarly with God: "God is, in the last analysis, utterly unknowable. As the German hymn writer Gerhard Tersteegen . . . put it: God comprehended ... is no God.' Pseudo-Dionysius, Maimonides, Thomas Aquinas, Eckhart, Luther, and others all understood this."20 I maintain that "Precisely because of this close connection with the idea of mystery, 'creativity' is a good metaphor for thinking about God."21 It should be clear by now that the theological proposal to think of God as creativity, creativity as God, does not mean that I claim to know what either God or creativity is. We humans are simply not in any position to make such claims about God or creativity: creativity and God are both profound mysteries to us humans. During the past 2000 years most Christians, of course, have not held to this strong position on the limits of human knowledge: instead they have "believed" have taken it to be certain that through Jesus Christ God has made Godself known in a definitive way, and the Christian revelation, therefore, is the only completely reliable and true path to God.22 I am not clear where 17IBC, 55. In IFOM I characterized a "mystery" as "something we find we cannot think clearly about, cannot get our minds around, cannot manage to grasp" (60; cited in IBC on 134, n.l). 18 IBC, 72. 19 J&amp;C, 18. 20 IBC, 57 (emphasis added). This is, of course, a central theme of the so-called negative theology, a theological practice going back to the early centuries of the Christian era and now enjoying a significant renaissance. For a brief summation of the "Negative Theology and the Word 'God'," see the Prologue of IBC, 22-26. 21 IBC, 56; this sentence and what follows it are discussed below on 93. 22 See Afterword, 111-13. For further discussion, including my critique of this claim about the Christian revelation, see J&amp;C, 12-20.</page><page sequence="12">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 87 Auxier stands on this matter. I am in agreement with him, however, when he states that "the assertion that God is definitely an impersonal being is indefensible. It is not knowable, if true" (30, emphasis added). But of course the assertion that God is "definitely personal" is equally indefensible.23 We simply have no way of knowing. So, if Auxier would withdraw his frequent statements that suggest I claim flatly that God is "impersonal," we would be much closer to each other than now seems the case. Let us consider now the term "creativity." By "creativity," as I have frequently asserted, I mean simply the coming into being, or bringing into being, of something novel, something truly new. In IBC I indicate that "I use the concept of creativity . . . rather than the traditional idea of "God the Creator" because it presents creation of novel realities as ongoing processes or events and does not call forth an image of a kind of cosmic person standing outside the world, manipulating it from without."24 Chapter 3 of IBC is devoted to examining the important modalities of creativity (as mentioned above on 79): Creativity!, the Big Bang; creativity2f the 14 billion-year evolutionary development through which many diverse realities in the universe come into being (and often later pass away); and creativity3, our own human creativity which has brought into being symbolic and cultural worlds and transformed the face of the earth. Throughout these discussions I continually remind the reader of the profound mystery of all this ongoing creativity. In the Preface of J&amp;C, for example, it is early pointed out that we humans "do not know why or how creativity comes about: it is a profound mystery. The mark that identifies the occurrence of creativity is its consequence: something strikingly new, something transformative has come into being and has become a significant feature of the ongoing world."25 We do not know why there is such a thing as creativity; we do not know what it is that creates; we do not know what direction(s) creativity will move in the future. All this is profound mystery. From the beginning of the universe all the way down to our present lives new realities have been coming into being constantly. Apart from creativity we would not exist; nor would any of the precious realities of our lives our hopes and dreams; our experiences of beauty, 23 Auxier agrees: see Auxier, 33, quoted below on 90 at the end of n.28. 24 IBC, 42. 25 J&amp;C, xiv.</page><page sequence="13">88 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy love, joy, and peace; our individuality and our sociality; our very humanity; our simply being alive, conscious, responsible, free, creative men and women: all these things that matter so deeply to us humans have come about by means of creativity. I do not make these claims because they are "objective" (Auxier, 26), or "impersonal" (31), or because of my adherence to "scientism" (26): they are claims about our very humanness, our personhood, about what is of deepest meaning and value and importance to us humans matters not often found in "the social scientific style of discourse," that Auxier says I use (32). At one point he sums up his critique of my position with this remark: "What does not seem to occur to Kaufman is that there can be ... a form of hypothetical ontology which asks why there are personal beings in the universe at all" (27). It is just such a "hypothetical ontology" that I am pointing toward, on the one hand with my concept of creativity?6 and on the other hand with the special discussion of that concept in Chapter 3 of J&amp;C, "Humans as Biohistorical Beings: Historicity, Creativity, Freedom." Let us look at a quotation from this chapter. In it early on I point out the significance of the word "biohistorical" in the chapter's title: The word "biohistorical" holds together in one both the biological grounding of our human existence and the historico-cultural dimensions of human life, thus high lighting what is most distinctive in our humanness_ The order of nature is, of course, the wider context within which human history has appeared, but it has been especially through our historical sociocultural development over many millennia not our biological evolution alone that we humans have acquired many of our most distinctive characteristics. Our increasingly comprehensive knowledge, for example, about the natural world in which we live and about our human constitution and possibilities has provided us with significant powers over our immediate environment and over the physical and biological, as well as sociocultural and psychological, conditions of our existence powers 26 Wesley Wildman has noted this point, and he mentions it in his essay; see 101, n.39, below. For elaboration of my metaphysical concerns, see IFOM, Pt. 3.</page><page sequence="14">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 89 that go far beyond those of any other animal. We humans, thus, have gained, in and through our various knowledges, a measure of transcendence over the nature of which we are part; and ... we have utterly transformed the face of the earth and are beginning to push on into outer space. Clearly we human beings, and the further course of human history, are no longer completely at the disposal of the natural order and natural powers that brought us into being. . . . [We] are not simply biological beings, animals; we are biohistorical beings. And in significant respects, our growing historicalness our historicity is the most distinctive mark of our humanness.27 I cannot spell out here the full significance of our historicity. On the one hand, we are significantly shaped by our histories; but on the other hand, we have increasingly gained significant control over some of the processes of historical change and development through which we are moving, and in that respect we possess a degree of freedom in our historicity. In order to survive in a dangerous world humans had to learn, in and through their historical experiences, how to maintain "delicate balances between creativity and continuity, freedom and order, in the cultures within which they were emerging"28 what we might call the beginnings of responsible ordering of their lives and their worlds. In the course of thousands of generations of slowly growing freedom and creativity, human persons, along with all the cherished personal qualities of human existence, gradually emerged from proto humans. It was the ongoing creativity in the world (God!) to which all of these developments should be attributed: we humans did not simply create ourselves. By now it should be clear that the story I tell here is far from being bound to the usual "standards of scientific and historical plausibility," as Auxier wrongly charged (though in its scientific and historical features, it is, I believe, in keeping with those standards): in its basic meaning and usefulness it is a story largely oriented by "standards of religious plausibility."29 27 J&amp;C, 64f. 28 J&amp;C, 67. 29 As these last few sentences should show, my understanding of our humanness is not really as different from Auxier's as he claims it is. He admits that we have emerged in a</page><page sequence="15">90 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Much more could and should be said about Auxier's insights into, and thoughtful reflections on, IBC and J&amp;C. But now it is necessary to move on to our third essay. III. Nancy Howell's Many Questions Like the other writers, Nancy Howell begins her remarks graciously by expressing her "great appreciation" for my work, especially with respect to my continuing to "construct theology informed by scientific themes of origin and development" and my inviting "readers to engage the process and progress of. . . [my] thinking about God." She hopes that her discussion "draws Kaufman into expression of what may be left unsaid in the short book" IBC (Howell, 34). Howell has a sensitive nose for ambiguities and puzzling tensions of many different sorts in the materials that she reads, and this enables her to ask a great many hard questions: "How is the divine-human polarity reconstructed?" (35). How "might . . . personal metaphors (perhaps explicitly interpreting biblical or traditional metaphors in a new way) ... function to elaborate the divine mysterious creativity?" (36). "How does serendipitous creativity introduce a new paradigm that confronts and unmasks classism, racism, or speciesism?" (Howell 37). "Is advocacy of self-sacrifice an indicator that Kaufman's theology retains some roots in traditional theological images, resulting in a somewhat long and slow evolutionary process; and both of us emphasize our human "personalness." For both of us, "There is personality in the universe, and it is compatible with what creativity has always been doing" (Auxier, 28) that is, presumably, creating. No disagreements there. The principal difference, as I see it, is in our understanding of this divine creativity. Auxier seems to believe that God must be "in fact actually personal in at least some ways. ... A wholly impersonal God, one that has no trace of personal existing, is a vicious abstraction" (ibid.). However, he does not explain why this must be the case; he seems to believe that it is impossible (and "vicious"!) to think that the amazingly mysterious creativity in the universe could bring into being "personal" realities (even in some billions of years), unless it was itself already in some respects personal. "How an impersonal God can serendipitously create personal beings, I cannot... understand," he says (Auxier, 30). Of course, that is how it always is with both serendipity and creativity! difficult to understand. It is better to say, I think, that there is indeed creativity in the world but how or why this is the case, we simply do not know; and what this creativity can or cannot do, we do not know either. The creativity from which everything comes is a profound mystery to us humans. In my view Auxier claims to know too much about what is required for personal beings to be created though at the end of his article, he seems to retreat from that position: "Is God a personal being?" he asks; "I certainly do not know" (33).</page><page sequence="16">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 91 uncomfortable fit between the theology of serendipitous creativity and compromising the response of his theological proposal to the marginalized with whom reconciliation is needed?" (39). "Are humans the only biohistorical beings or processes?" (39). And others. It is good to see the range of pertinent questions that Howell recounts, but (I am sorry to say), I will not be able to address many of these here. For the most part I want to focus my remarks on some of the questions Howell poses about my idea of God as "serendipitous creativity"; and in connection with that I will take up some concerns she has about the concept of mystery. Beginning with IFOM (1993), "serendipitous creativity" has been the defining metaphor in terms of which I organize my thinking about God. In her paper Howell raises the question early on whether it may not be a serious methodological mistake to have a "defining metaphor." She cites Sallie McFague's claim "that a multiplicity of models or dominant metaphors is necessary to describe God because adopting diverse metaphors prevents idolatry" (Howell, 35). This claim, of course, immediately puts my whole theological program into question. McFague and I have discussed this matter, and I think we may simply disagree. This is a very important point, raising methodological questions about how we humans think, and theological questions about the concept of monotheism. Monotheistic religions employ one overarching symbol or principle to orient our human thinking, faithing, and worshipping, in the hope this will bring peace and order into our lives. In contrast polytheisms with multiple principles and metaphors tend to have many "loose ends," and can move in a variety of directions since they have no organizing principle that holds everything together in an organic whole.30 Traditional Christian theology with its doctrine of the trinity has tried to have it both ways: God is three-fold, and God is one. But this does not solve these problems of diversity and unification: the doctrine of the trinity specifies that God may not be thought of as either more or less than three-in-one. It should not be surprising, then, that this rigid formula itself turns into just another form of idolatry in some types of Christianity, often becoming dogmatic, legalistic, and rigid in contrast to Jesus' openness to all comers and his plea to love even our enemies. I 30 These points are discussed in some detail in IFOM, ch. 6.</page><page sequence="17">92 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy argue that a God conceived as serendipitous creativity should spawn theologies that remain flexible, alive, and creative. Early on in her essay, Howell "wonder[s] whether serendipitous creativity expresses relationality" (35) another important question. "Serendipitous creativity" is an unusually open and relational metaphor. The concept of creativity is dynamic and it implies relatedness to all things that come into existence: (1) by being their sources (2) because (by definition) it is novel realities that creativity brings into being the novelty being one feature of its relation to everything that already exists; and (3) because this creative activity always builds on something already in place and thus connects the new that is coming into being with what is already there.31 Moreover, the adjective "serendipitous" (which is often mentioned in Howell's article but never examined) suggests that the creativity we are considering here is not bound to patterns or momentums already existing, but brings entirely new, unexpected, and previously inconceivable realities and relationships into being. That would seem to cover a very large range of interconnections and relationships a much more open field of creative activity than the traditional Creator-God mustered. Howell raises some interesting questions about the relationship of creativity to agency. She notes (Howell, 39f) that in an earlier period of my theological reflection I advocated thinking of God in terms of agency, but more recently I seem to have rejected that model as I have increasingly highlighted the fundamental mystery that we encounter as we seek to understand not only God but also creativity. Consider this quotation from IBC: "'creativity' is simply a name with which we identify this profound mystery of new realities coming into being; it is in no way an explanation of it" (Howell, 40). Howell holds that this sentence "certainly strips theism of personalistic or agential attributes, and the focus shifts to emergence of beings apart from divine causation or explanation" (ibid). The first half of this sentence is correct, but the second half is dubious. In it Howell is touching on a deep ambiguity in my thinking about creativity. If "creativity" is the "coming into being" or, as I sometimes put it, the "bringing into being" of the new, it seems that it must involve some kind of "divine causation." For this "coming into being" is clearly attributed to creativity to the divine, to God. Perhaps, with regard to this matter, I use the term 31 See the discussion of "creative trajectories" in J&amp;C, 22-24, 48-51.</page><page sequence="18">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 93 "creativity" in a self-contradictory way that I try to excuse by calling it a mystery? I am not certain how serious this problem is. But it seems to be somewhat contagious in my theological writing. For example, consider this text (Conner discusses a similar one on 5f.): Precisely because of this close connection with the idea of mystery, "creativity" is a good metaphor for thinking about God. If used properly, it preserves the notion of God as the ultimate mystery of things, a mystery that we have not been able to penetrate or dissolve and likely never will succeed in penetrating or dissolving. This aspect of the notion of creativity draws us into a deeper sensitivity to God-as-mystery than some of our religious traditions do, with their talk of God as the Creator. For this latter concept seemed to imply that we knew the ultimate mystery (God) was really a person-like, agent like being, one who "decided" to do things, who set purposes and then brought about the realization of those purposes.32 Does moving the understanding of God away from the comprehensible idea of agency to the mystery of creativity prove fatal for the symbol of creativity? Heretofore I have assumed the opposite to be the case: traditional views of God's cosmic agency have seemed to me no longer intelligible (in light of modern evolutionary thinking),33 and for this reason (in part) I have suggested reconceiving God as the mystery of creativity. This seems to me an important step into greater intelligibility. It may, however, raise some grammatical questions (Wittgenstein): Does this move violate some kind of limit? Does the grammar of the word "mystery" imply that putting too much weight on it will simply dissolve away its meaning? These are important concerns.34 32IBC, 56. 33 See IBC, 54-56. 34 In an article I hope will be published soon on "Mystery and God: Living Within the Boundaries of Human Knowledge," I continue to assume that no grammatical limits are violated in this sort of theological approach.</page><page sequence="19">94 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Howell has spotted some expressions where I seem to lean on agency-language in my articulation of the notion of creativity. For instance, in one place I speak of a "developing activity (creativity) that should itself be thought of as God" (Howell, 41).35 "Activity" is agency-language, is it not? Well, sometimes it is, but sometimes it is not. Some examples: "There's lots of activity in the beehive today"; "Mt. Helens is a very active volcano"; "The fire-storm became active again last night"; and so on. When I wrote the lines Howell cites, I was casting around for a way to avoid agency-language, and I finally decided that "activity" would be all right. But Howell has raised important questions here. In another nearby quote in IBC she points out that I speak of (a) "God (creativity) . . . [as] always and everywhere active in some degree and some respect," that (b) "God's activity . . . apparently changes ... in time," and then (c) "the context in which God is acting"] (Howell, 41; emphasis added). Howell points out that in this sequence of texts I have not been able to maintain linguistically the totally non-agent conception of God that I attempt to develop in IBC. And she humorously, but graciously, declares that "Kaufman leaves a few mysteries in the theological proposal (perhaps intentionally)" (42). As she concludes her essay, she says that in view of the various ways of "interpreting God as serendipitous creativity, I am seized by a desire to understand more about the model of God and God's relationship with the world" (42); and then she lists some of that "more" with a number of questions specifying further important issues needing address if my project is to go forward: First, are notions of divine immanence and transcendence meaningful and important, or is their meaning vaporized in the divine mystery? What shall we make of claims that God as "mystery of creativity ... is itself unqualified, is absolute" alongside the proposal that God (creativity3) "seems to be in certain respects a creation of creativity2" (which Kaufman defines as the complex creative, evolutionary processes of the universe)? How limited or large a concept is the rejected notion of person that Kaufman dissociates from God? .. . How shall we understand the symbolic polarity 35 Quoted from IBC, 103.</page><page sequence="20">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 95 of God and humans in light of the polarity of the encompassing symbol of creativity? What is the "scale of God" that veils God in mystery, and how shall Christians (and others) live into the "much vaguer and less vivid" human relationships with God? (Howell, 42). "Questions are not criticisms," Howell says, "but sincere, positive, and constructive responses to Kaufman's theological imagination and construction. The divine mystery of serendipitous creativity with its complex trajectories invites extended reflection" (Howell, 43). I appreciate very much Howell's many pertinent queries: they bring up matters that need further attention in my work. IV. Wesley Wildman on My Naturalism and Creativity esley Wildman begins his remarks in a very complimentary way. V V "What would theology look like," he asks, "if it were entirely this-worldly, with no traces of mythology or supernaturalism? ... In his recent books, In the beginning. . .Creativity and Jesus and Creativity, theologian Gordon Kaufman gives the clearest, the most persuasive, the most hopeful, and the shortest answer to . . . [this] question . . . that Christian theology has ever seen. He is to be commended on all four virtues" (Wildman, 44). He then describes the context of my work as the struggle in the religions between the worldviews of "naturalism" and "supernaturalism," and he says my position "involves a naturalist worldview" (44). Such a worldview, Wildman states, subordinates information from sacred traditions of purported revelation to the findings of science whenever there is conflict or overlap. . . . [The] implications of a naturalist worldview disturb many religious people.... Naturalism seems to violate virtually everything that they prize about religion, from the moral motivation and joyous hope of an afterlife to the fervent expectation of supernatural answers to their heart-felt prayers... . [N]aturalism, if true, would force them to approach the Bible's accounts of miracles with great suspicion, which casts a pall over the Bible's role as an authoritative,</page><page sequence="21">96 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy practical, and inspiring guide for their daily lives. .. . Meanwhile, others find the supernatural world utterly implausible. They are deeply uncomfortable with the inauthentic pretense they feel compelled to uphold when they involve themselves in religious practices that presuppose a supernatural worldview. And they desperately long for a serious interpretation of religion that fits their naturalist way of living and understanding. Survey data suggest that this group is much smaller than the supernaturalist group in the United States at the current time. . . . What is surprising is that so few theologians . . . speak directly to and on behalf of such people. Kaufman does so, without any hint of apology to supernaturalists (Wildman, 45f). Wildman goes on to state that the "root of the problem" of supernaturalism is the understanding of "God . . . conceived of as a supernatural being with intentions, plans, and both the power and willingness to act in the world." Hence, "the first theological move within a naturalist worldview is to reform the idea of God. . . . [T]here are many resources for non-supernatural ideas of God in the history of theology and philosophy, . . . [and] Kaufman . . . proposes to conceive of God as a process of creative activity rather than as a personal supernatural being" (46). Wildman notes in particular that I do not claim that "all creative trajectories are conducive to human flourishing" and that I freely allow . . . that we could get smashed to smithereens by an asteroid, or destroy ourselves through our own wicked stupidity with deadly weapons or ecological negligence. But serendipitous elements of creativity make our existence possible and support our cultural and personal aspirations, and it is those aspects that we most strongly identify with the word "God" (46). I do not reject Wildman's characterization of my theological position as a form of naturalism; but I seldom use this word myself because it is often understood to imply a reductive scientistic program that does not display sufficient appreciation of human and humane</page><page sequence="22">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 97 values and meanings. As I stated in my response to Randall Auxier (82-88, above), I do not want to be identified with that sort of naturalism. Wildman says that "I do wonder about his [Kaufman's] confidence in a naturalistic worldview" (Wildman, 50). I do not quite know what to make of this remark. I certainly reject its suggestion that I put my confidence in one or more worldviews. I put my confidence in God, in the creativity manifest throughout the universe. I have a number of problems with Wildman's treatment of my conception of God as serendipitous creativity, but I can take up only a few here. At one point he says that "Kaufman's creativity has no independent ontological standing by contrast with the world process; it is the creative spontaneity of the world, under another name and this is by no means a reductionist statement but rather an affirmation that the ontological depth of the world is creativity itself (Wildman, 55). This may appear to be a profound characterization of creativity, especially because of the two phrases, "the creative spontaneity of the world" and the "ontological depth of the world." Both of these phrases, however, contradict the primary meaning of the word "creativity," as I use it. Instead of treating creativity as the source of the world and all that is in it, they both treat creativity as an aspect of the world. So creativity is not understood here as the ultimate reality with which we have to do: in these formulations it is the world that has that ontological standing. And that turns much that I intend upside down. In IBC, creativity! is the ultimate source of the world, of all that is (cf. Genesis 1, the Big Bang, etc.); and creativities2 and 3 are not simply features of the world: they are sources of significant features of the world. Thus, in IBC I treat each of the three modalities of creativity that I examine as expressions of the ultimate reality with which we have to do; that is, expressions of the source of the world and all its contents all quite orthodox! But in Wildman's formulation these ontological relationships are reversed. On his reading, it is the "world process" not creativity that should be treated as ultimate. A little further along, in his comparison of my understanding of God with John Cobb's, Wildman takes up what he calls "a fascinating ambivalence (56)" that he has noticed in my writings 36 For a brief discussion of my view of "naturalism," see "Biohistorical Naturalism and the Symbol of'God'," Zygon 38, No. 1 (March 2003): 95-100.</page><page sequence="23">98 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy all the way back to In Face of Mystery. ... On the one hand, Kaufman speaks of God as creativity and goes to great lengths to emphasize that creativity is not always friendly to human interests. Yet, on the other hand, he speaks of God as the trajectories of creativity that are serendipitous relative to human interests, thereby distancing God from the nasty events that destroy harmony and peace. Which is it? (Wildman, 56f). It is both, of course, but not in the way Wildman has presented them here. The phrase that I have italicized is an incorrect characterization of my understanding of God. I never claim God is "distant" from anything. Creativity seems to be present in everything going on roundabout us all the time. Some of that creativity is in accord with our human interests and concerns, and we find ourselves thinking of it as serendipitous for us; some other examples of creativity like the huge tsunami a few years ago do not immediately strike us as serendipitous. That does not mean, however, that they are not serendipitous: they may well be serendipitous in many respects for other living creatures; for the long range future of life on planet Earth; for developing features of the universe beyond our understanding or knowledge; and so on. As I conceive it, creativity the coming into being of the truly novel is always serendipitous: it always goes beyond what is expected or predictable or explainable or imaginable; and on many such occasions that serendipity has been beneficial for us humans. Wildman, however, is evidently unwilling to consider this position. "God as creativity itself," he says (as noted above, 79-80, n.7), "is a morally perplexing religious concept, at best, and at worst it ought to be utterly repudiated as morally disastrous for human affairs" (Wildman, 58).37 He makes a mistake when (following Cobb), he 37 "Serendipitous creativity is a part of God (as creativity itself)," Wildman says, "but not all of God. . . . Either we love and worship and serve God all of God or we love and serve and worship the humanly serendipitous parts of God, in which case we should apply the word 'God' only to those parts of creativity itself. Kaufman requires us to ground our religious beliefs and moral convictions in one part of God knowing that other parts of God contradict them" (Wildman, 58f). I have no idea what the phrase "parts of God" could possibly mean; and the phrase "parts of creativity" is equally obscure. So I cannot make any comment at all on this suggestion. It should be noted, however, that on the very last page of his article, Wildman seems to take a different position, much closer to mine (see 102, n. 39 below).</page><page sequence="24">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 99 identifies God "with only the serendipitous creativity that typically supports good and wholesome human aspirations," as he insists on doing (57). This would be precisely the kind of anthropocentrism in our idea of God that we must move beyond today, as we learn to live in an ecologically ordered universe. So I will not "repudiate" the broader idea of God as creativity itself, as Wildman knows well: "Kaufman ... is intimately aware of this issue and is very far from backing" away from it (57). In my view, only as we develop an appropriate christology can we address fully the issues that Wildman is bringing up here. In the Afterword this claim will be more fully developed. In a very unfortunate paragraph, as he brings his essay to an end, Wildman claims that my methodological standpoint is thoroughly human-centered, if not egocentric: [In] Kaufman's thought (though not clearly exploited in his two short creativity books)... we cannot know what God is like so we should apply the word "God" in the ways that suit our purposes, making sure we take full responsibility for whatever choices we make. . . . When and if circumstances require it, Kaufman would transform the meaning of "God" in a new direction to accommodate the needs of that new context. This no doubt strikes some readers as cynical and opportunistic (Wildman, 59). Indeed it does: and I am one of those readers! probably the most surprised and shocked one. Wildman notes, however, that this interpretation of my thought is "not clearly exploited" in my two recent books. I am quite certain that never all the way back to my Essay on Theological Method (1975), where I first present the notion of theology as "imaginative construction" have I expressed myself in anything remotely like these crass terms. The symbol God is the most powerful, most significant, most profound, and most important in our Western religions and cultures (and in many other places as well). Though it is, of course, a creation of the human imagination like all other symbols it is not something that we have the right to play around with every time the wind blows in a different direction. With Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, humanity moved into an entirely new and very dangerous cultural, religious, and technological situation.</page><page sequence="25">100 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy In consequence of this, I have felt called to reconceive, in certain respects, the deeply revered symbol of God.38 In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam God has been understood most fundamentally as the Creator of the world a human-like being who is the source of this magnificent universe and all its contents. This understanding is usually traced back to the grand opening chapters of the Bible. In the older, cruder story (Genesis 2) God takes clay from the ground and like a human potter or sculptor molds it into Adam. In the later more majestic presentation of Genesis 1, God is portrayed as like an all-powerful ruler or magician who gives an order, "Let there be light," and light is immediately created. The similarities of God to humans in these accounts were not, of course, their main point: their central message was that this whole glorious universe and all its contents, including us humans, were brought into being by amazing acts of creativity. In the biblical story, creativity does not end with the opening chapters of Genesis. God continues bringing new realities quite unexpected new realities into being. As the prophet Isaiah declared: Thus says the Lord (Isaiah 43:14a)... Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old. I am about to do a new thing: now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? (43:18-19a).... From this time forward I make you hear new things, hidden things that you have not known. They are created now, not long ago; before today you have never heard of them (48:6b-7a). God presented here as continuously bringing new things into the world appears to be virtually creativity itself. Because of human artistic handiwork and human speaking, the authors of the early Genesis texts were aware that new things come into the world through human artistic handiwork and human speaking. These examples of human creativity evidently led them to imagine God as creative creative of all 38 For fuller discussion of this matter, see especially the Preface and Chapters 1 and 2 of IBC; and J&amp;C, 102-114. See also 84f. above, nn. 12 and 13.</page><page sequence="26">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 101 that exists. Opening our eyes to the mystery of creativity was their great gift to us humans. Today we have a fuller understanding of the creativity that has brought into being our universe and like the old creativity story, this new one is also filled with mystery. As we have noted, this creativity story begins with a fantastic mystery, the so-called Big Bang, 14 billion years ago; it continues through many evolutionary stages over billions of years as the cosmos with its galaxies and stars and planets, and many different sorts of atoms begins to form. More mystery! Eventually conditions were such that life could be created; the creativity that continues with the evolution of that life gradually covered the earth with many amazing patterns and forms. And in the course of more billions of years we humans with our emerging powers of creativity gradually came into being. What an awe-inspiring mystery this story is: according to this account, everything there is has come into being through creativity. For a number of years I have been suggesting that we think of God as simply this creativity. This massive creativity is a profound mystery (as we have been noting repeatedly here), largely beyond our human comprehension: and today there is no reason whatsoever for us to continue thinking of it as "human-like." The evolutionary story greatly widens and deepens our conception of this mystery. Creativity God! is manifest through this long process from the Big Bang all the way down to the present. And we can hope and expect this creativity will continue on for a long future. Thinking of God as this massive ongoing mystery of creativity removes all anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism from our God talk, but it retains the feature that, from Genesis 1 on, has virtually defined God: creativity. I consider this proposal, therefore, to be an appropriate extension of the traditional understanding of God.39 However, a significant point remains in Wildman's claim that though believing in this God-as-creativity can help warn us and guard us from every kind of idolatry it really does not help us much in ordering and assessing our lives, developing humane norms for living, thus guiding us in our day-to-day moral and religious decisions. What, after all, can we really know or understand about where this creativity is moving For further discussion of the appropriateness of this extension, see 107-110, below.</page><page sequence="27">102 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy today? To address these issues, we must turn to christology. But what kind of christology? Here Wildman apparently agrees with some of my views: [I]n our time, and in a naturalistic framework that emphasizes creativity, the Big Question is whether we can exercise our creative powers to continue the human project, enhancing the parts we prize, controlling our violence, and shunning our terrible ability to destroy our world. . . . Kaufman believes that traditional Christological thinking does not help with this question. In fact, in Jesus-trajectory it is not even clear that Jesus can be a relevant model for us because his true humanity is accompanied by true divinity in a way that does not apply to the rest of us. In Jesus-trajectory2, however, we learn to see Jesus as an expression of creative, natural, and very human possibilities that he both taught and enacted in his life. We certainly can take that as a model for creatively engaging our lives and our human and planetary future (Wildman, 46f).41 Wildman declares that my "portrayal in Jesus and Creativity of Jesus' moral and spiritual vision is genuinely bracing" (Wildman 52). "Jesus' radical commitment to agape love, and his burning conviction that it should and could be expressed at every moment of our lives, present a compelling picture of an extraordinarily creative possibility" (47). And 40 Wildman's language on this point remains confusing to the end: "Kaufman supposes that God is creativity itself, which is the closest he approaches to a full-blown metaphysical theory, but then he would also have to recognize that this usage is useless for the moral purposes to which he believes religions and religious people should commit themselves in our time" (Wildman 59). And that, of course, is where the Jesus story an ongoing story running through the past 2000 years comes in, as I will show in the Afterword. It is interesting to note that Wildman seems, at the end of his article, to move away from anthropocentrism to a more theocentric position. Despite his claim just quoted that the idea of God as "creativity itself ... is useless for . . . moral purposes," on 60, his final page, he seems to come close to my position in his declaration that "whenever we construct 'God' in an efficacious way, we find ourselves engaging creativity itself in and through those artful constructions we engage not just the bits we like or can understand but the whole incomprehensible reality of it." 41 For discussion of Jesus-trajectories and 2, see J&amp;C, xi-xiii, 9-28, and also Auxier, 23 25.</page><page sequence="28">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 103 he wonders why I have not developed a "theory of religious genius" (54, Wildman's emphasis) to account for Jesus' significant uniqueness. Each of these remarks about Jesus by Wildman, like most christological thinking, focuses on Jesus as an extraordinary individual (which, of course, he was). But in J&amp;C this individualistic theme is not made central. Rather, our attention is drawn to Jesus as an indispensable link in an increasingly creative sociohistorical movement. This historicist christology is readily intelligible in today's naturalistic intellectual climate. Moreover, it is a christology that can appropriately amplify and qualify what is lacking in IBC. This novel christological approach (to be briefly sketched in the Afterword) seems not to have been noticed by either of the two writers who discussed J&amp;C. It is, however, a central theme in that book. V. Edgar Towne on God-as-Creativity In the title of his article Edgar Towne mentions my "admirable candor about talk of God," but in the essay itself he shows that there are a number of hard questions in that talk that need to be addressed. In my remarks here I will focus on two of the issues that he raises. One has to do with the physical or bodily presuppositions of our human knowing and imagining; the other is concerned with the linguistic usage of our word "God." In the past I have not given much attention to the first of these; I have, however, given considerable thought to the second. Towne thanks me for suggesting that the "cluster of ideas centering in Jesus of Nazareth . . . can helpfully be considered to be an image"; he has "worked with Kaufman's notion of the image in terms of its aesthetic qualities derived from embodiment" (Towne, 64). This is an important matter that I have not explored. He proposes in this article to make a transcendental argument [Kant] ... for the precognitive influence of the human body in the structure and process of human knowing. This implicitly involves spontaneous responses, emotions, and feelings aesthetic qualities into the knowing process. It must also allow for every human form of religious experience and theistic belief as well as their absence and denial (65).</page><page sequence="29">104 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy I have some difficulties grasping how Towne is using Kant in his article. Sentences like, "God can be . . . apprehended, but not in such a way that in the apprehension what is known is known as God" (ibid.), seem to me rather baffling. Here is another example: Towne says correctly that for Kant "There are no non-sensible intuitions" (ibid.). A few sentences further on, however, he states that "Kant's non sensible intuition [of which there are none!] is functionally equivalent to the culturally determined name, 'God'" (Towne 65f). What does this mean? that the name "God" tells us nothing? I am not at all clear about this sentence, and a great deal may turn on it. A little later he says that "Kant and Kaufman and I agree that the word 'God' emerges in human discourse" (66). That is, of course, a fairly obvious point. Towne seems to be calling our attention here to the important "distinction . . . between nature (all organic and inorganic processes since the Big Bang) and culture (all biohistorical processes known on planet earth)" (66f). His point is confusing, however, for many biological processes are deeply involved with both sides of this distinction, as he has made it. So what point is he making? His argument becomes clearer when he reminds us that for Kant "Intuition and concepts constitute ... the elements of all our knowledge" (Towne, 67), for this brings him to a concern he definitely wants to emphasize: Intuition here implicates the human body productively in human knowing at the level of consciousness . . . [and] at a pre-conscious and pre-cognitive level, also, the body enables the spontaneous syntheses of the imagination (of apprehension, reproduction, and recognition) that are necessary to knowing and to the "transcendental unity of apperception" [emphases added]. These syntheses occur as non-conscious processes. . . . We need not interpret these processes to be mental only, and it is part of the recent "postmodern" situation that the influence of the body in human knowing is widely recognized (67f). We have arrived at a significant point: there is bodily activity (most of it unconscious) underlying all imagining and thinking. This observation</page><page sequence="30">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 105 must have important implications for my proposal that we should think of imagine God as creativity. However, instead of moving the argument forward along that line, Towne drops it (indicating he cannot go any further [Towne, 68]), and turns to some of my autobiographical remarks about being "'tone deaf with respect to so-called religious experience" (68f). He seems to be connecting these remarks with my describing God by "an abstract noun, 'creativity,' which is convertible in Kaufman's mind with 'God'" (69). He may intend this to be a continuation of his concern about the question of bodiliness in our thinking and imagining, but that remains an undeveloped issue, as he goes on now to present an analysis of "God-as-creativity": ["Creativity"] is a generalization deduced by the human mind from observation of cosmic, biological, historical, and experiential processes, which are concrete.... However rich, complex and dynamic, "God" as an image, is also abstract, the product of imagination in the context of culture; but the term names nothing actual whether as the image that it is or as an actuality beyond the image. "Creativity," of course, also describes both cosmos and history because it is from observation of them that. . . God ... is described by "creativity." Does Kaufman's creativity have a nisus toward concreteness, creation, "reified" actualities? No, this is not part of its connotation. It is an abstraction only. Its only relation to concreteness, Kant's realm of appearances given by empirical intuition, is derived by deduction from reason alone. Despite his naturalism, Kaufman provides no specifiable relation of God to nature, from which history and culture (within which God-talk happens) emerge (ibid.). (The last sentences in this quotation seem to me to be inconsistent with the first sentence.) I think there are at least two large problems with this indictment. (1) The argument here seems to be just one more version of the deep "realist" suspicion about the mental and imaginative dimensions involved in all our concrete experience of "actualities." It is</page><page sequence="31">106 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy surprising to me, given Towne's deep Kantian knowledge, that he would be making such a point. Perhaps I am missing the subtleties of his argument.42 (2) Towne states (apparently as a criticism) that for Kaufman "In no sense is God concrete reality" (Towne, 69). That point is hardly original with me: as the writers of the "negative theology" emphasized, no ordinary qualities such as "concrete reality" can properly be predicated of God.43 Moreover, from early on God was thought to be a totally "spiritual being." Does this claim (widely, though not universally, made in the tradition) not also bear on these matters? "In effect," Towne declares, "Kaufman has provided a counter confessional confessional theology. It departs from tradition and confesses how he has arrived at his understanding of God and Jesus.... He confesses his own religious and theological pilgrimage" (Towne, 69). I do indeed "confess . . . [my] own . . . pilgrimage," and I "depart from tradition" in certain respects. But I also am working throughout with tradition not only in my concern with the words "God" and 42 Consider these points: (a) Is it really the case that "Kaufman provides no specifiable relation of God to nature, from which history and culture .. . emerge"? The whole story of creativity is about the coming into actuality of everything that has been and everything that now is: this certainly includes all of nature, history, and culture. No doubt this is all a profound mystery, but that does not mean there is "no specifiable relation of God [creativity] to nature." Towne is mistaken when he says that the "symbol/concept, 'God,' . . . contemplates no empirical apprehension of God [i.e. of creativity] in any sense, depriving the idea of any connection to the viscerally aesthetic aspects of experience that spontaneously lend power to the symbol's influence in human behavior" (Towne, 69). For creativity is, after all, a well-known and deeply experienced human phenomenon with profound "viscerally aesthetic aspects of experience." What is he trying to say? (b) Was there really an actual "historical Jesus" who preached to and healed people 2000 years ago? This claim about Jesus can be established as correct through very elaborate and detailed historical arguments but only very few doubt there was such an actual person, and this "actual" Jesus certainly continues to be of great religious importance to many, (c) Are atoms actual? What about light-years? Are thoughts actual? Surely feelings are actual. There are many different types and degrees of "actuality," and they are named in our languages. All of them are, nevertheless, in many quite diverse ways, products of mentality and imagination. So what does Towne mean by saying "Kaufman's creativity" has no "nisus toward concreteness"? (Towne, 69) "concreteness," of course, is a very "abstract" noun. Virtually all human experience is shaped by language, and thus by mentality and imagination, but is nevertheless concrete in some respect(s). 43 In addition to this point, we must recognize that according to my proposal creativity is a profound mystery. And "mysteries" are certainly very important actualities in our human experience.</page><page sequence="32">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 107 "mystery," and some aspects of the negative theology; but especially in my use of the word "creativity" to characterize God, as I shall argue in a moment. I am completely in agreement with Towne (though he apparently doubts this) that "The idea of God . . . connotes more than a Kantian idea or reason . . . and is a product of the emergence of culture from nature, of the interaction of biohistorical . . . beings with their social and natural environments" (Towne, 72). And in chapter 3 of J&amp;C I sketch some of the long slow path through which humans came to create such ideas as the image/concept "God."44 What I want to do now, however, is make clear the very real connection of my notion of God as creativity with the more traditional idea of God as The Creator.45 Towne states early on that "Kaufman . . . would not agree with me that 'God' is ... a proper name" (Towne, 63).46 1 do not believe I ever made such a strange claim. I have used the name "God" for as long as I can remember, and more recently I have regarded it as more or less interchangeable with the word "creativity" as can be seen in such books as IFOM, IBC, and J&amp;C. It is important to me that in this case these two words both have the same referent. That is why I say frequently "God is creativity and creativity is God": that is, creativity is that to which the proper name "God" should today be understood to refer.47 If that connection cannot be made, it is not God that I am talking about when I speak of "creativity." How should we decide whether this connection is legitimate? Obviously, we cannot just arbitrarily attach the name "God" to whatever comes to mind as a plausible candidate. We need to ask ourselves, What has given the word "God" the great significance it has in our religious and cultural traditions? This word names a very important existential reality: God was believed to bring salvation from all ills, fulfillment of life. The name "God," thus, has considerable weight and is often given a central place in human life and consciousness: God is taken to be that reality and the word "God" is taken to express that complex meaning that brings wholeness, meaningfulness, salvation to human existence. Fresh imaginative 44 For some discussion of this point, see above, 88f. 45 See also 99-101 for pertinent discussion of this matter. 46 He reiterates this point later in his article: "we may retain personal and agential language analogically because that is the coinage of religion . . . [and] we may use the term "God" as a proper name" (Towne, 74). 47 Towne suggests this may be grammatically illegitimate (see Towne, 63, n.8), but he does not spell this out enough to make the point clear.</page><page sequence="33">108 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy construction of the image/concept of God can be regarded as appropriate and legitimate only if it is warranted linguistically; that is, only if the new application is in significant continuity with the way this word has been employed in the past. (What constitutes "significant continuity" in this matter is, of course, a judgment call on which there are sharp disagreements.) I cannot fully establish here the claim that God can and should be thought of as creativity. The most that I can do is suggest briefly the sort of argument that can be made.48 There are (in my opinion) two major themes that have, in conjunction, given this symbol its extraordinary power and significance in human life. On the one hand, God has usually been conceived in quasi-human images, and has been regarded as a kind of focus or center in terms of which human life can come to fulfillment: God has been thought of as a humanizing center of orientation for life. On the other hand, God has been envisioned as mysterious and beyond all human knowing or manipulating, the all-powerful creator of the heavens and the earth and the determiner of destiny, the ultimate judge of the world the relativizer (as I sometimes put it) of everything human and finite.49 These two dimensions of our inherited idea of God humanizer and relativizer function in conjunction with each other: either taken without the other would undermine and ultimately destroy the meaning and significance of God as the proper object of human devotion and service. The rules of our language (I suggest) require that these two central motifs must be retained in complex interconnection with each other in any new version of this symbol, if it is to be a legitimate reconstruction of what "God" is expected to name: only an "X" which we today can properly regard as both relativizing (calling into question) and humanizing us humans, as well as relativizing and humanizing the world in which we find ourselves, may be legitimately regarded as that which the word "God" names. What is meant here by the phrase, "the rules of our language"? I do not have anything technical in mind only the fact that we would 48 I have presented more elaborate arguments on this matter in a number of places, beginning with IFOM (1993); and further developments of my thinking about it are now available in IBC (2004) and J&amp;C (2006). See 84, n.12 above, for a brief sketch of the beginnings of my theological usage of the word "creativity." 49 See Kaufman, Essay on Theological Method {1995):59-63, 66-68.</page><page sequence="34">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 109 not be able to understand each other (or to understand ourselves, for that matter) in our everyday use of language, if we did not follow certain generally accepted rules governing the way we put together our words and sentences. When children learn to speak English, they learn the rules of English usage along with the many words they are taught; Chinese children learn to follow quite different rules; and so on.50 Among the rules that we English speakers learn is one requiring that what we call "proper names" must designate something quite specific and particular think of such names as George Bush, New York City, Yale University, the Big Bang, the planet Mars. If we started using language in an arbitrary way supposing that we could designate anything we please with such names it would not only be impossible for us to communicate with each other about such matters; it would be impossible for us even to think them, for we would never be certain about just what it was that we were trying to think. And so it is with the name "God": the rules of our language (I am suggesting) require that if we wish to reconstruct our symbol "God," we must keep in mind that this symbol is used to focus our attention on an "X" with universal humanizing and relativizing motifs in appropriately complex interconnection with each other. The name "God" (in the Bible and elsewhere) is understood to refer to the ultimate reality with which we humans have to do, the source of all that is, the "Creator of the heavens and the earth" (as the Bible puts it). These characterizations imply that all realities there are of which we are aware (or unaware!) must be taken into account as we seek to understand what is named by the word "God." Because of the all-inclusiveness of this word, it has been necessary repeatedly throughout the diverse millennia that this symbol has been effective in orienting human living, acting, and thinking to engage in imaginative constructive attempts to re-conceive, to think through afresh, what can rightly be called God.51 If we today still think it important and desirable, to continue living out our lives in significant relation to God that is, in significant relation to what we are linguistically justified in calling "God" we also must undertake our own imagining, and see whether we can, perhaps, find images and concepts that will 50 The most fully developed, and persuasive, argument for this conception of language and its importance is to be found in Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations (Oxford: Blackwell, 1958). 51 Detailed historical evidence for this claim will be found in the Prologue of IBC, 1-31.</page><page sequence="35">110 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy enable this ancient mutilated and soiled symbol to take on new life. This broad sociocultural "reality testing" which the symbol "God" in face of new historical conditions has continuously undergone, has often provided in the past a basis for its significant reconception. The symbol "God" has, thus, frequently been adapted imaginatively to the changing circumstances of human existence in different cultural settings.52 This is obviously a symbol of considerable durability and flexibility, and it continues to show much more vitality today than some observers had supposed (a few decades back) would be possible. I shall not say more here about the appropriateness of connecting the symbol "God" with the creativity in our universe. In the two books we are examining I have presented the best arguments I know on that issue, and I have tried to show that it is appropriate today to think of God as creativity, creativity as God." Many persons, formed by traditional understandings of this basic religious symbol, may remain unpersuaded. There are others, however, who find this way of thinking about God to be liberative, indeed saving, for us humans living in today's world. An Afterword on Jesus and Creativity. In the Foreword I indicated I would need to say something in a concluding section about the importance of J&amp;C in the overall argument of my "two-part set on God as Creativity"53 In IBC I made it clear that in my view creativity was to be "understood as the coming into being of the new whenever and wherever this occurs new evils (as we humans understand them) as well as new goods"; and this "raises some difficult questions"54 (as Wesley Wildman also pointed out). Are we to worship a God that brings evils into the world as well as goods? Perhaps so: "There is, after all, another much greater, more comprehensive creativity than ours going its own way in the universe, and it relativizes, and often overturns, our creative activities, projects, and goals."55 "Clearly creativity without qualification creation of 52 A discussion of this claim about the ongoing "reality testing" of the symbol "God" can be found in Gordon Kaufman, "Evidentialism: A Theologian's Response," Faith and Philosophy (1989) 6:35-46. 53 J&amp;C, xi,. 54 IBC, 60. 55 Ibid., 45.</page><page sequence="36">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 111 historical trajectories going in almost any direction cannot be regarded as a norm appropriate or helpful for the guidance of human life and activity: our human creativity . . . must be directed toward bringing goods into the world, not evils."56 What kind of God is this creativity anyhow? Probably not a very attractive one that takes special care of humans?57 J&amp;C addresses these questions at length; but neither Wildman nor Randall Auxier (both of whom discuss J&amp;C) seems to have noticed how that small book deals with this serious problem. I need to quote here some rather extensive passages from J&amp;C to clarify this issue. As some of the texts to be quoted point out, none of the Abrahamic religions have regarded God's being creator as sufficient in itself for the ordering and orienting of human life: in Judaism this problem is addressed by the Torah, the gift of God's teachings and laws; in Islam there is the Quran with a similar function. What about Christianity? For Jesus' followers ... the overpowering impact of his ministry, death, and resurrection at first only on a small group of Jewish women and men, then in succeeding decades becoming a largely Gentile movement changed ... this decisively.... Jesus Christ became the lens through which the creator-God was now increasingly seen: the image of the crucified messiah and his resurrection put everything in a dramatic new light, as the exalted rhetoric of a variety of New Testament authors shows clearly: "No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him" (Matt. 11:27). . . . "No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he [Jesus] has made him known" (John 1:18 RSV). . . . "He is the image of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15). . . . "The Father and I are one" (John 10:30).58 56 Ibid., 61. 57 Wesley Wildman (57-59) and Randall Auxier (21-23, 29-33) both emphasized these kinds of concerns in their essays (as we have seen). 58 J&amp;C, 12.</page><page sequence="37">112 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy This language is very strong: "it claims that God had actually been basically inaccessible to men and women through most of human history, but had become accessible through Jesus, that is, through the complex of events surrounding and following upon the ministry and death of Jesus."59 Jesus became the central revelation of God for the (increasingly Gentile) Christians. A sense of Jesus' utter uniqueness in teachings and behavior and fate, especially after his crucifixion and supposed resurrection, led Christians to regard him as a new and definitive revelation of how humans should live and what God is like. For them, "apart from Jesus, God is ultimately inscrutable mystery a mystery that had, however, been unveiled in and through the person, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus."60 Jesus' unusual characteristics and actions were likely an expression of his messianic mission. His love for and kindness to the poor, the oppressed, the outcast; his concern for the sick and disabled, his ministry of healing, and his exorcisms of evil spirits and other miracles; his eating and consorting with "sinners" and his freedom from a legalistic view of the Torah; his teachings about love of neighbors and even of enemies: clearly this was a quite different messianic figure than had been expected. He even told his disciples not to resist persons who were harming them (Matt. 5:39), and he made no efforts to lead an insurrection against Rome; moreover, he refused to respond violently to those who arrested him, and he forbade any resistance by his closest followers. If Jesus' actions and teachings were an expression of God's kingship, then the kingdom of God that Jesus claimed was coming soon must be very different from any ever seen on earth.61 On the one hand, this sense of utter newness in Jesus' message, actions, and fate, and on the other hand his charismatic authority which was further certified by his alleged resurrection, as Paul makes 59 Ibid., 13. 60 Ibid. 61 Ibid., 37.</page><page sequence="38">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 113 clear meant that Jesus had been commissioned by God, the creator of the heavens and the earth. For Christians who believed and accepted these claims, it increasingly became apparent that who God is, and what God requires of humans, could be known only in and through the Jesus story. This raised an important question that was widely debated: Is Jesus' God the old Jewish God, or is it some new hitherto unknown God? In due course it became agreed by many bishops and their congregations that it was indeed the Jewish "Creator of the heavens and the earth" in which Christians were to place their faith. The definitive revelation of that God, however or, as we today might prefer to put it, that by means of which Christians ultimately identified and defined this God was the configuration of images, stories and events associated with Jesus. This has continued to be the case for Christians down through the centuries, and it still obtains. All of this, of course, has important implications respecting Christian appropriation today of the notion of God as creativity: it means that at least for Christians creativity can not be fully or correctly understood apart from the Jesus-story.63 Can the specific indeed unique set of events in the Jesus-story illuminate in some significant way such an all-encompassing reality as creativity! a creativity in which everything has its origin? . . . [T]he concept of creativity that we have been employing ... is too general to provide us with much specific information on anything in particular, and thus any guidance on the decisions and actions, large and small, of everyday life. . . . [T]hat sort of detailed guidance . . . provided [in Judaism] by the legal sections of the Torah and commentaries [was] . . . 62 "Jesus Christ.. . was declared to be Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead" (Rom. 1:1 and 4). 63 This was specifically suggested a few times in IBC, e.g.: "Clearly creativity without qualification ... cannot be regarded as a norm appropriate or helpful for the guidance of human life and activity: our human creativity, in accord with the normative christomorphic images, stories, and ideas in the New Testament, must be directed toward bringing goods into the world, not evils" (IBC, 61; emphasis added). "[H]ow we live out our lives and take responsibility for ourselves and our activities . . . must . . . [be] normed of course ... by the directions in which creativity appears to be moving in our part of the cosmos and by the christomorphic principle" (68). The term "christomorphic" is briefly defined at IBC, 133 n.12.</page><page sequence="39">114 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy in the early decades of the Christian movement . . . largely displaced by the developing image/story of Jesus his actions and his teachings, his crucifixion and his resurrection all elaborated and extended in the growing Christian movement. . . . And in due course this christic input into the understanding of God became central to the meaning of the word "God" as it was employed by most Christians: God is a trinity ... of which Jesus is the "second person," and God is preeminently love.64 This was, in important respects, new thinking about human life and about God. The whole understanding, conception, and meaning of the word "God" were becoming drastically transformed by Christians; and that transformation must be taken into account for Christians today who are interested in thinking of God as creativity. However deeply mysterious is the creativity from which everything has come, included within that "everything" must be the normative dimensions of meaning and value in the human biohistorical trajectory. Creativity (God) must be conceived, thus, to be as intimately and appropriately involved with the dimensions of the human trajectory that make life meaningful and precious as with any others. . . . Those respects, then, in which Jesus and love have significant normative meaning for Christians are also quite properly to be attributed to creativity (God). The normativity of the image/story of Jesus shows itself in its powerful attractiveness to some men and women as a model for humans, catching their attention and drawing them to itself; and it gives those who commit themselves to it a sense of what they can believe God (creativity) is bringing about on planet Earth a sense of the direction in which creativity may be moving in our human world and (as we may... hope) will continue to move in the future. . . . [C]reativity (God). . . brought forth Jesus as a normative 64 J&amp;C, 52.</page><page sequence="40">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 115 model, and . . . creativity... brought forth love, regarded (by Christians) as the ultimate criterion of what humans ought to become and to be. . . . However important these claims may be for us living on planet Earth, they do not, of course, tell us much about the creativity in the wider cosmos the creativity that will determine the ultimate future of planet Earth and its inhabitants.65 So the Jesus-story is essential for Christian understandings of God-as creativity. Of course, in many versions of the Christian story the early radicalism of Christianity is, unfortunately, not emphasized. And what I have regarded here as essential is often, therefore, scarcely mentioned. I conclude these remarks with some quotations from the last few pages of J&amp;C's final chapter, entitled "Creativity is Good News Ultimately . . . we must put our trust in that wider [cosmic] creativity deeply mysterious, but also surprisingly beneficent as we humans play out our own creative role in addressing the problems we face.. .. The human story and its context to date . . . can provide grounds for hope respecting the future: from its very beginning this story is about a trajectory of serendipitous creativity and its effects a creativity that was deeply beneficial to the gradually emerging human life. . . . [W]hat is needed [today] is a worldwide conversion a religious-like conversion! to a new and quite different way of ordering our societies, our institutions, our cultures, our religions, our families, our individual lives. . . . [W]e must... come to terms with the major problems we now 65 Ibid., 53. I hope these quotations and those to follow immediately make it clear that, when the word "serendipitous" is coupled with "creativity" (in my usage), this does not mean that some "good" creativity is being distinguished from "bad" creativities, as Wesley Wildman has argued (97-99, including n. 36 and 102f, n. 139; also see Conner, 79-80, n.7 above, for extended discussion of this matter). And I hope these quotations, bearing on Jesus and the consequences of his ministry, death, and resurrection, show how far off the mark is Randall Auxier's suggestion that for Kaufman the "Jesus movement is an impersonal historical snowball rolling down the hill of time" (Auxier 32).</page><page sequence="41">116 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy face if the human race is to survive into the future and flourish in that future.66 Jesus believed that the kingdom of God was beginning to break into human history; and he regarded his own healings of sickness and suffering and his forgiveness of sins, as signs that this kingdom was coming soon. He believed that humans should love not only . . . God and their neighbors but their enemies as well, "so that you may be children of your Father in heaven" (Matt. 5:44 45). And this love was understood in a very radical sense. It required, for instance, repeatedly forgiving the offenses of others against us ... ; going "the second mile" and "turning the other cheek" (Matt. 5:43-47)_ All this was brought into sharp and unforgettable focus by the final events of Jesus' life: he refused to defend or protect himself from his enemies, and he accepted meekly the whips and curses and finally the suffering of a violent death at their hands.67 Jesus was obviously a very creative figure: he imagined a world decisively different from the one he lived in.... This vision of the possibilities of human beings of the potentiality of humankind is certainly one of the most radical ever set forth. Jesus' belief that human existence should (and could!) at all points radiate agape love captivated his followers and powerfully motivated them to change their lives.68 At this portentous moment in history, more than ever before, we need visions of the human and understandings of history that will facilitate our movement toward an ordering of life that is at once humane and universal, an ordering in which the integrity and significance of each tradition and each community are acknowledged, and the welfare of every individual is 66 J&amp;C, 99, 105. 67 Ibid., 111. 68 Ibid., Ulf.</page><page sequence="42">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 117 respected. It is important that we lift up into full view every insight and every vision no matter from what tradition or culture it comes that might throw light on how to move forward from the ugly inhumanities in which we seem to be trapped. . . . New cultural patterns of association and cooperation must be developed, new institutions must be invented, new ideologies that are at once universalistic and truly pluralistic must be created.69 I make no claim that the image/story of Jesus and his early followers is the only one that can inspire the creativity that is needed if we humans are to address effectively the large problems we face today. However, ... the history of the many sorts of creativity evoked by this story and image over the last two thousand years is quite remarkable. ... It is with this in mind that I am suggesting that... the radical themes in the image/story of Jesus, demanding the transvaluation of our generally accepted values, . . . [can] inspire new models for the creativity that we humans must now cultivate. . . . The self-giving agape-love that Jesus advocated and exemplified during his life will inspire us, we can hope, to find ways that will help create a more truly humane world for the future. The creativity of Jesus continues... .70 69 Ibid., 113. 70 Ibid., 114.</page></plain_text>
