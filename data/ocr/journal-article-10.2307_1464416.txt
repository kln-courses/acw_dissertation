OSBORN INTRODUCTION From its very beginning Christianity has suffered a persistent, chronic strain of hostility to Jews and Judaism (Gollwitzer, 1980:121f.).' One can find it, for instance, in the designation of God's covenant with Israel as the "Old" covenant and in the way the New Testament frequently makes Jews as such, and not merely elements of Jewish leadership, responsible both for Jesus' death and for the persecution of early Christian witnesses. The sad history of Christian anti-Semitism is well documented by Rosemary Ruether, who draws a rather unbroken line from the New Testament to the Holocaust. "The Nazis," she observes, "of course, were not Christians. They were indeed anti-Christian.... Nevertheless, the church must bear a substantial responsibility for a tragic history of the Jew in Christen- dom which was the foundation upon which political anti-Semitism and the Nazi use of it was erected" (1974:184). Eberhard Bethge states that anti-Semites like Hitler had "only secularized and thus provided a racial basis for what heretofore had been established upon a foundation prepared by religion and theology" (196). In view of this story the question persists, "Is the New Testament itself already anti-Semitic?" (Thoma:14). Is the Holocaust an inevitable outcome, though perhaps a reductio ad absurdum, of essential Christian faith? Robert T. Osborn is Professor of Religion at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27706. 1 The immediate context of this paper is my recent exposure to the remarkable and important conversations among some German Christians and between these Christians and Jews on the meaning of Judaism for Christianity and Christianity for Judaism. What differentiates these conversations from most of their American counterparts is that they have been carried on to a large extent within official ecclesiastical circles (the Rhineland Synod of the German Evangelical Church in particular) and are conversa- tions with and within the church, and not just among individual Christians or academics. This German experience and my feeling that it is important for American reflection explain the preponderance of references to German discussions, as opposed to American.</page><page sequence="2">340 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Rosemary Ruether comes close to this conclusion when she states that anti-Semitism is the left hand of christology, the negative side of the claim that Jesus was the Christ (1974:64f.). It must also so seem to Jews. Bethge cites Golda Meier's biography, where she recalls when, even as a five year old, she was identified as a "Christ-murderer" (Bethge:194f.). Must Christians, in order to be Christians, so under- stand Jews? To be pro-Christ, must one be anti-Jew? The prima-facie evidence would suggest so, since a Christian hatred or at least disrespect for Jews and Judaism seems to be as old as Christian love of Jesus. THE CHRISTIAN SIN OF ANTI-SEMITISM If it is true that Christianity is essentially anti-Jewish, then there is nothing more to discuss-at least theologically. Any criticism or judgment of this anti-Semitism from the perspective of faith and theology necessarily would entail a compromise or rejection of them both. Christians would have the choice either to be anti-Semitic, in the name of Jesus and in obedience to the word of God, or to cease to be Christian in disobedience to the word of God and Jesus the Christ. The theological overcoming of anti-Semitism is a priori impossible on the premise that Christianity as such is anti-Jewish.2 Alternatively, it is no solution to propose a non-Jewish Christian- ity that would acknowledge the Jews as Jews, in their self- understanding as God's chosen, covenant people, and yet would understand itself apart from and independent of the Jews in a circumstance of mutual independence and indifference. Such a solu- tion is impossible because an essential dimension of Jewish self- understanding is that as God's chosen people they are exclusive instruments of God's universal salvation.3 A Christianity that acknowl- edges the Jews as Jews would have to acknowledge not only this claim of Jewish faith, but also Christianity's dependence upon Jews and Judaism for its own self-understanding and for its share in God's salvation history. Only if Judaism were redefined as a parochial religion, valid for the Jews alone, could Christianity acknowledge the truth of this Judaic claim without a correlative dependence upon it. But so to redefine Judaism is to reject it at its very heart. This is precisely the route proposed by Rosemary Ruether in her effort to avoid an anti-Jewish Christianity. The Christian, she suggests, can recognize herself or himself as "in the same historical situation as the 2 1 am using the terms "anti-Semitism" and "anti-Judaism" interchangeably, recog- nizing that the religious and the racial aspects of Christian hostility to Jews are inseparable. 3 See Genesis 12:3 and Isaiah 49:22-26, for example. Also Schechter:114f.</page><page sequence="3">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 341 Jews, indeed as peoples of every culture, making his way through the desert... ." (1972:23). Similarly, she contends that "the story of Jesus parallels, it does not negate the Exodus.... When Easter is seen not as superceding or fulfilling the Exodus ... but as reduplicating it, then the Christian can affirm his faith through Jesus in a way that no longer threatens to rob the Jew of his past .. ." (1974:239). But Christians hardly need to "rob" the Jew of the past when the past has no universal significance, when the Jew has already been robbed, as it were, when the Exodus is regarded as only a symbol of a transcen- dental ideal that Christianity can realize in its own way quite apart from Israel. According to Ruether, both Christianity and Judaism should forego pretensions to exclusivity, because "a universal lan- guage which can unify all mankind ... cannot be the already estab- lished possession of any one of these traditions. .... The future point of unity exists now only in the transcendent universality of God and in his universal work as Creator, which gives us the basis for affirming universal human kinship" (1974:239). Thus Ruether denies the very essence of Judaism-its covenant relationship to God, upon which the salvation and unity of all humankind ultimately depend. Similarly, she denies the essence of Christianity-its christological focus on the Christ or Messiah of the Jews. A non-Jewish Christianity is anti- Jewish and, for that reason, anti-Christian.4 Christianity can overcome its own anti-Jewishness only by recog- nizing that when true to itself it is in fact pro-Jewish. However, if this be the case, how is it that Christians have been anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic, apparently from the beginning? Contrary to Rosemary Ruether, if anti-Semitism is not the other side of christology, then why is anti-Semitism so chronic a dimension of Christianity? To answer this question I argue that Christian anti-Judaism has its roots not in Christian faith but in Christian faith-lessness. Anti-Jewishness is the 4 Ruether claims that Judaism avoids a "parochialism" in its view of election which would lead to a confusion of its own particular identity with the ultimate, by distinguishing between the covenant with Israel and the covenant with Noah. (See 1974:235-237). This conclusion from the Noachine covenant will not wash. The Noachine covenant is the divine promise that the God of Israel will not destroy the world, but will sustain it and preserve it for its salvation through the covenant with Israel. Among the "fixed elements" which are to be found "in the Rabbinic literature of almost every age and date" is "the belief that the establishment of this new kingdom [the Messianic kingdom whose establishment follows the destruction of the enemies of God] will be followed by the spiritual hegemony of Israel, when all the nations will accept the belief in the unity of God, acknowledge his kingdom and seek instruction from his law" (Schechter:102). Thus Schechter can also properly suggest that Rabbinic teaching (referring particularly to commentry on Isaiah 44:5) "becomes a sort of spiritual imperialism with the necessary accompaniment of the doctrine of the 'Open Door' through which the whole of humanity might pass into the kingdom" (106).</page><page sequence="4">342 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Christian sin, the sin of which Christians alone are so singularly capable.5 The truth in Ruether's contention is that christological faith makes such sin possible, for through Christ Christians become the only Gentiles to know the truth about the Jews and so find themselves in a position sinfully to deny it. The truth revealed to Christians in Jesus is that the God of the Jews, the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as witnessed in the Old Testament and as incarnate in the Jew Jesus, is the one, true God, and that this God comes to the world and reveals himself to all peoples only in and through this one people, the children of Israel (in our times, the Jews), and through one of them in particular, the Jew of Nazareth called "Jesus." Precisely this knowl- edge distinguishes Christian faith6 and also makes possible the distinctive Christian sin of falsifying the truth of Christ, which is also the truth of the Jews.7 The form of sin we are talking about here, recognized by Karl Barth as "the specifically Christian form," is the sin of "lying," the evasion tactic employed by the sinner in the encounter with Christ (371). If pride and sloth are the works of sin, falsehood is the word of the man of sin. In other words, lying is sin in its theological form (a sin of which professional theologians are therefore most adept) (373). "In the mouth of human teachers, in the ears of human listeners it [the truth] is always threatened by some measure of misunderstanding, deception, falsification and corruption." Indeed, Barth adds, "false- hood loves to take the garb of doctrine, ideal, principle and system" (376). The primary focus of this paper is on this theological form of anti-Semitism. Lying, then, is the prerogative only of those who have encoun- tered the truth and are thus in a position to falsify and distort it--i.e., lie about it. Their lying presupposes and feeds on the truth; "the devil has nothing of his own to oppose to God, but only his falsifying intimations .. ." (373). The liar will not negate the truth; "on the contrary, he will affirm it emphatically." As only Barth might have observed, the liar "kisses the Master as Judas did" (436). Since this lie so feeds on the Christian knowledge of the truth of Christ, it is, as we have seen, "the specifically Christian form of sin." What makes the truth of Christ so offensive, notes Barth, is simply 5 "Real anti-Judaism with all its excesses existed only in Christian countries" (Gollwitzer, 1961: 287). 6 As Gollwitzer notes, "whoever speaks of Christianity must unavoidably speak of Judaism" (1978:121). So having to speak of the Jews, Christians can speak either faithfully and truly or faithlessly and falsely. 7 Christian falsehood, says Barth, is "the disguise or mask which the man of sin at once assumes when he is confronted by the true witness," namely, Jesus Christ (IV, 3:434).</page><page sequence="5">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 343 that it is the truth of Jesus Christ, a truth that cannot be separated from him. There would be no offence in the truth as such, in the idea of the gracious intercourse of God with man and the grateful intercourse of man with God.... Nor could there be any objection to the existence of an extraordinary, authentic Proclaimer of this truth. ... The painful and scandalizing thing which man wishes to avoid is the identity between this man and this truth, between this truth and this man.... Since this man is identical with the truth and the truth with Him, the encounter with the truth and therefore with Him... becomes an absolutely vital, binding, decisive and even revolutionary affair. That is why the man of sin would like to escape it (440f.). He can take the man or the truth, but not both. "He seeks to silence, suppress and eliminate their identity. This is the work of falsehood." The problem with the man Jesus, says Barth, is "Gethsemane and Golgatha, and therefore the truth as the truth of His death and passion" (441). At this point we must go somewhat beyond or behind Barth to recognize that this man Jesus and his cross are so offensive essentially because he was and remains a Jew-the quintessential Jew, the very Messiah of the Jews. It is as a Jew that Jesus is so wholly other. If the truth that we meet in Jesus is inseparable from his Jewish person- hood, then we meet in him also the unacceptable and radical judg- ment that the truth is not in us, who are the children only of Adam. Were he one of us non-Jews, we could imagine the truth in him as a potential of us all and thus not so wholly other or revolutionary. But the truth that he as a Jew brings and that the Christian encounters in him is itself a "Jewish" truth: the truth of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God who is attested by the Jews and who attests to the Jews. To know the Jews as they really are is to know their God, and to know their God requires that we know them as God's chosen sons and daughters. If this is the truth as encountered in Jesus Christ, then Christian sinners who seek to avoid it have at least three possibilities. First, following Drews, they can seek to perpetuate the crude and unpersuasive lie that Jesus never existed and that he is at best a mythological expression of a truth that can be possessed indepen- dently of this mythical man. The second kind of lie is more indirect and effective. It does not deny Jesus' existence; it affirms him, often enthusiastically, as a teacher or prophet in whom we do encounter truth, but a truth that is essentially separable from him. The third lie, perhaps the most pervasive, is the least recognized because it is the most subtle and convincing. Here Christians directly deny neither</page><page sequence="6">344 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Jesus nor his essential relationship to the truth, but only that he is Jewish. However, since as a matter of historical fact Jesus was Jewish, a person who existed and was human only as a Jew, this denial is tantamount to a rejection of Jesus altogether, of his very historical, human existence. Furthermore, since his God is the God of the Jews, the falsifying denial of his Jewishness also is a denial of the truth of God that we encounter in him. So to rid Jesus and Christianity of their Jewishness is the most powerful way of lying, for thereby we Chris- tian sinners can allege to confess Jesus, the truth of God and the unity between them. We can have every semblance of the truth and yet effectively deny and seek to avoid its reality. For Christians, then, anti-Semitism is the quintessential sin of lying-it is nothing but "blasphemy." In the Holocaust "all confes- sions of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who elected these people are made a mockery, because for Christians the planned and executed rooting out of the elected people of God is perfect blas- phemy.. ." (Synodalbeschluss:268). THE CHRISTOLOGICAL LIE While the lying, anti-Semitic proclivities of theology are every- where evident, perhaps the two most critical loci are the christologi- cal-regarding the person and work of Christ, and the theological- concerning the nature and knowledge of God. Of these, the christo- logical is primary because it is the basis for the theological. The first deception at the christological level is the claim, despite the New Testament witness, that in reality, in the mystery and truth of his own person, Jesus was not Jewish.8 He just seemed to be. Since Jews cannot separate or distinguish their humanity as such from their Jewishness, the denial of Jesus' Jewishness is tantamount to a docetic denial of the reality of his very human existence-his concrete, historical and only real humanity.9 The second falsification maintains that it does not matter if Jesus was Jewish, since the resurrected Christ and Lord of the church certainly is not. Jesus is not Jewish Perhaps the most common and influential case of the first form of the christological falsehood is the negative application of the criterion 8 "The person of Jesus does not permit being isolated either from the Old Testament or from the Judaism of his day" (Thoma, 1968:167). 9 As Leander Keck observes, "It was as a Jew that Jesus trusted God and not as a man in general believing in the divine in general" (219). Schechter makes the point more radically when he notes that "according to some Rabbis, Israel's election was, as it would seem, predestined before the creation of the world.... Israel was there before the world was created" (59).</page><page sequence="7">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 345 of dissimilarity to identify the authentic sayings of Jesus. The princi- ple, widely employed in biblical scholarship, holds that sayings attributed to Jesus that are not dissimilar to Judaism (and to Christi- anity) cannot be regarded as authentic. Following this principle, Kasemann concluded that "only in a few instances are we standing on more or less firm ground; that is, where the tradition, for whatever reason, can be neither inferred from Judaism nor attributed to primi- tive Christianity..." (206f.). The principle has had fairly wide adop- tion, especially by scholarship in the tradition of Bultmann and, if we want to go back further, also in liberal theology, as reflected, for instance, in the writings of Schleiermacher and Harnack. Harnack assumed that historical, critical scholarship would reveal that the essence of Christianity has to do with "something which is common to us all," and was accordingly persuaded that "Jesus Christ's teaching will at once bring us by steps which, if few, will be great, to a height where its connection with Judaism is seen to be only a loose one, and most of the threads leading from it into 'contemporary history' become of no importance at all." He entertained no doubt that "the founder [Jesus] had his eye upon man ... upon man who fundamentally always remains the same" (9,16f.). The essential Jesus is every man, not the Messiah of the Jews; he just seems to be a Jew. For his part, Bultmann pointed to this negative application when he stated that "where opposition to the morality and piety of Judaism and the specifically eschatological tone, which constitutes what is character- istic of Jesus the preacher, are expressed, and where on the other hand there are no specifically Christian features, it is easiest to conclude that there is an authentic parable of Jesus" (227). The trouble with this negative criterion, which Schilebeeckx says "must not be employed" (93), is that it assumes that the differences between Jesus and Judaism are alone determinative of his relationship to Judaism, so that the distinctive and essential Jesus is a priori not Jewish. As Bultmann understands it, the essential Jesus is in "opposition to the morality and piety of Judaism." In American biblical scholarship, perhaps the most consistent application of the principle of dissimilarity is to be found in the writings of Norman Perrin.lo Since it is the nearly unanimous consen- sus of biblical scholarship that the "kingdom of God" is the theme of Jesus' ministry, scientific scholarship as pursued by Perrin must show that and wherein Jesus' employment of this kingdom language was in fact dissimilar to Jewish (and also Christian) practice. Perrin did this 10 It is important to say here that I am not implying or stating that Perrin or any other scholar whose works are cited in illustration of Christian anti-Jewishness is in any way personally anti-Semitic, but only that the tradition of scholarship in which they find themselves has fundamental anti-Jewish dimensions.</page><page sequence="8">346 Journal of the American Academy of Religion by demonstrating to his satisfaction that Jesus, in non-Jewish fashion, employed the word "kingdom" as a "tensive" symbol. As such it is not a "concept," a "well defined understanding of the nature and form of the activity of God" (29-32), but a symbol "standing for some larger meaning or set of meanings" which it mediates for human experience (39). As a tensive symbol it is one whose "meaning could never be exhausted or adequately expressed by any one referrent" (22), as for instance an event in Israel's history. Perrin contrasts a tensive symbol to a "steno symbol," what is generally understood as a "sign," such as is predominant, according to Perrin, in traditional Jewish apocalyptic, and which unlike the tensive symbol, has a one-to-one relationship to the specific reality (event) it represents. When one knows the event, then the steno symbol itself can be abandoned and the story retold in terms of critical historiography. Perrin recognized that the symbol "kingdom" as employed by Jesus appears to refer to the history of Israel, but that for Jesus this history is conceived in a most un-Jewish fashion as "myth." The announcement of the coming of the kingdom becomes then a "chal- lenge to the hearer to take the ancient myth with renewed serious- ness, and to begin to anticipate the manifestations of the reality of which it speaks in the concrete actuality of their experience" (43). The petitions of the Lord's prayer, all of which are contained in the one, "thy kingdom come," are not invocations of a divine action, but mythical evocations of a human experience. They "represent realistic possibilities for the personal and communal experience of God as king.... God is to be experienced as king in the provision of daily bread, in the forgiveness of sins . . ." (47). Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom thus bestows on his hearers "the responsibility to explore the manifold ways in which the experience of God can become a reality to man" and to understand the kingdom of God not as a "single identifiable event which every man experiences at the same time," but as something "which every man experiences in his own time" (198f.). Israel, with its Heilsgeschichte and its apocalyptic hope, is surrendered for every man and his "experience." This approach to the Gospel tradition of Jesus not only alienates Christianity from Judaism by separating God from the history of Israel (as meaning is separate from the myth which symbolizes it); it also separates Christian "truth" from the event of Jesus. If Jesus did understand the kingdom as a tensive symbol of an inexhaustible "existential reality" and not as a steno-symbol of a specific, concrete historical event, then the New Testament community could not, in faithfulness to Jesus, have done what it in fact did, and interpret the "kingdom" as a steno-symbol of the particular event of Jesus himself or perhaps of his promised second advent. The Fourth Gospel is</page><page sequence="9">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 347 clearly out of order with its ego eimi, with its substitution of Jesus himself for the kingdom of God as the focus of Jesus' own witness. That Christians should make anything of Jesus at all, that they should have written gospels, is a bit mystifying on these premises. Christ is not Jewish The second christological misrepresentation is that Jesus in his flesh may well have been Jewish, but that as the resurrected Christ he certainly is not. The argument here, drawn from the tradition of Christian theology, tends to appeal especially to an interpretation of Romans 9-11, where Paul explores the significance of Jesus' life and death for the Jews and for the relationship between Jews and the church. The gist of this line in its varied expressions is that Jesus entered the camp of the Jews not in order to save them, as appear- ances might suggest, but in fact to wrest the covenant from them and give it to the church. This "Trojan horse" theory takes a variety of forms. Berthold Klappert in his analysis of these, each of which tends to eliminate the particularity of Israel, designates the first as the "substitution" model (1980:18f.). His example is the Berlin court preacher, Adolf Stoecker (1834-1909), who made three basic points: 1) Before Christ, the history of Israel is the history of denial and disobedience against God's patient efforts to call this people to himself. 2) After the crucifixion of Jesus, the children of Israel are no longer to be regarded as the elect, for "with the rejection of Christ the Jewish people have forfeited their calling to the Church" (1980:14f.). 3) The only hope for Jews is for the individuals among them who become baptized Christians. By giving himself to be rejected and crucified by the Jews, Jesus in fact became the occasion of their rejection of the covenant and their yielding it up to the church. They were deceived, it would appear, into thinking that by denying Jesus they could and would maintain their calling and their identity as God's people, whereas in that very denial they who sought thus to save themselves instead lost their souls as God's elect and chosen. Second is the integration model, based upon a reading of Romans 11:1-6, according to which the church has replaced Israel as God's people. Israel's future as God's people now depends on the integra- tion of a remnant into the church, which becomes a church of both Jews and Gentiles. Paul catches this notion in his two-fold view that the church is based in Israel and Israel matures in the church, to which Klappert responds-"It never occurred to Althaus that Romans 11:25 in no way speaks of the coming entrance of the whole of Israel into the church, but to the contrary, of the entrance of the eschatologi- cal, full number of heathen into the elect people of Israel" (1980:17).</page><page sequence="10">348 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Essentially a variation of the substitution model, this one also denies to Judaism any significance after the crucifixion. A third model, which can be interpreted either as substitutionary or integrational, is the typological, according to which "Israel, its history and institutions are.., .the type of the church and of the salvation ultimately represented by the church" (1980:18). Klappert sees this model implicit in the text of Vatican II, Nostra Aetate, in which the exodus of Israel from Egypt is conceived as a mysterious anticipation of the salvation of the church. As in the preceding models, with the coming of the church as a benefit of the work of Christ, Israel loses any significance and importance of its own and instead finds its significance after the cross and only as it is integrated into the church. The fourth, the illustration model, is the "negative form" of the other models sketched above, in which Israel is understood as "the negative foil for the church" (1980:20). In explanation, Klappert recalls the reaction of Rabbi K. K. Geis to the view of Judaism in Harnack's, Das Wesen des Christentums-"the one sad justification for the existence of Judaism is that it can serve as the dark background for setting forth the full light of Christianity" (20). As Helmut Gollwitzer has observed, from this perspective God seems to have reserved "judgment for Israel and grace for the church." A most influential spokesman for this view is Ernst Kasemann who, in his exegesis of Romans, states that "Paul must shatter Israel's claim based on its own history just as he must that of the individual person who makes a claim based on his piety. That Paul does so expressly, proves that Israel has exemplary meaning for him, namely, that in and with Israel the Jew which is hidden in all of us is confronted-the man, that is, who makes claims and demands against God and to that extent serves an illusion instead of the true God" (41). Klappert notes in response that "here Kaisemann stands in the tradition of his teacher R. Bultmann, for whom the particular history of Israel becomes the illustration and example of the fall of human existence-as-such under the power of the law" (1980:23). The final model identified by Klappert is the "subsumption model." He finds it somewhat surprising that according to this model it is the negative "privilege" of Jews to "illustrate the existence of the person under the law, the self-righteousness of that person, and his or her consequent fall, but not also the corresponding positive privilege of Israel and the Jews to be the primary example of the person under the gospel, the recipient of the divine justification and the covenant. Rather, we find that it is godless humankind as such that is first elected and justified, and that Israel is elected and justified only</page><page sequence="11">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 349 insofar as it is subsumed within the general category of humankind" (1980:22). Rejecting Bultmann's teaching that election pertains not to Israel but to the existing individual, Kasemann claims that "justifica- tion alludes... primarily to God's lordship over the world and only therefore over the individual" (1980:252). Paul "breaks the covenant with Israel ... insofar as he challenges its exclusive connection with Israel and comprehends it anew by deriving its validity from the creation" (1980:252). After Christ, God's covenant is with creation rather than with Israel; the "theology of the cross and the eschatology of creation shatter the election and the covenant of Israel," says Kasemann. "The God who is bound by his covenant partner cannot be the God of the cross and of the Godless" (1980:252). Accordingly, Israel can be saved only as are the Gentiles, only as they deny their Jewishness and are subsumed under the universal justification that is in Christ and available in the church. Before we turn to the next section we must recall an earlier statement that the theological sin of lying occurs primarily at the methodological or hermeneutical level, where choice and decision are still operative in the determination of presuppositions, and not primarily at the subsequent level of research, exegesis, and applica- tion, where scholarship and the data allege to determine the results. In the above cases I have contended that the functional anti-Semitism of the kind of scholarship represented by Perrin is based on the elected presupposition of the anti-Jewish principle of dissimilarity. The various models of Christian-Jewish relationship discussed by Klappert all presuppose that Christianity has replaced Judaism and has no need for it. At issue is only to demonstrate how this position is manifest in the text and to draw out its necessary implications. That there are other possible presuppositions in both cases is clear. I cited Schilebeeckx and Keck as examples of scholars who have rejected as categorical the negative employment of the principle of dissimilarity, and Klappert continues his exposition by presenting "models for the determination of the relationship between Israel and the church which tend toward an acknowledgment of the continuing election of Israel" (1980:26-37). Klappert's own interpretation moves in this direction. THE THEOLOGICAL FALSIFICATION Necessarily, the misrepresentation of Jesus as not Jewish and as having separated the church and Israel by taking the covenant from Israel and delivering it to the church, leads to a similar misconstruc- tion and falsification of the church's understanding of God. When Jesus' witness to God and the Christian confession of him as the Son</page><page sequence="12">350 Journal of the American Academy of Religion of God are thus abstracted from their original Old Testament and Jewish context, they necessarily fall into the context of the general human situation, where the word "God" no longer refers to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who acts to fulfill the promises he makes to Israel, but to the God of religion who is the alleged presupposition of and answer to the universal human quest. Similarly, theology remains no longer a radical "biblical" theology, which seeks to understand Christian faith in God in terms of the existence and history of Israel and of the Jew, Jesus, but tends toward a Christian "natural" theology, which seeks to interpret Christian faith with reference to human nature and history as such. The difference between these methods is radical; as Pascal has reminded us, there can be no confusion between the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the God of the philosophers (and the natural theologians). Hans Joachim Kraus quotes the distinguished Berlin Rabbi, Leo Baeck, who observed that God is not God because he is more than but because he is other than the gods; "in relation to them he is incomparable" (103). The God of the Bible, Jesus' God, is the God of Israel, and because, as Kraus notes, "God's existence is self-determined as an existence-for- Israel..., all ontological speculation is excluded; the self-revealing God of the Bible withdraws himself from the world of religion, from that autonomous, anthropomorphic 'middle ground' between God and the people.. ." (229). The themes of creation and exodus are specific foci of the biblical contradiction of the religious perception of life and the world. Since the God who exists for Israel is the creator of the world and the world is God's creation, the creating and sustaining power of the world and its ultimate authority are not to be found in or of the world, whether as its height or depth; all the demons of the world are denied their authority, and the numina of nature lose their power. As creatures of this God, humankind is not to be the religious slave of the deities, but the free lord of all, created in the very image of God. As for the exodus-it is an earthly, political event that at the same time estab- lished and inaugurated the holy history of Israel. In Kraus' words, it is "the radical new in the world of religion," in which religious salvation becomes a political liberation. "At the beginning of all Israel's ways there stands not a mysterious experience of revelation or a holy place, but a profane, this worldly action of the God of Israel ... in which God steps forth as a fighter for his people and for humankind" (231f.).11 11 Kraus quotes Kierkegaard to this point: "Therefore my soul ever returns to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. There one feels that it is human beings who are speaking" (87).</page><page sequence="13">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 351 The Biblical God There are four dimensions of this biblical view of God that I would emphasize, and I would do this in terms of some of the traditional attributes of God. First is the love or the grace of God, what we might call the attribute of immanence. We recognize, to begin with, that the immanence of the creator God of the exodus cannot be conceived ontologically or metaphysically. Rather, God must be understood historically by referring to those events within history in which God comes to us, in human form, on our level, in the flesh and blood history of a particular people. God is not the God who eternally is with us, but the God who temporally comes to us. With the coming of this God to earth the heavens are effectively emptied and the spirits of the earth exorcised. God is God with us not as a spiritual height or depth, but as a person and people among us. Correlatively, the divine transcendence, the holiness of God, is found not in the metaphysical difference between time and eternity, but in the wholly otherness of the concrete particularity of that history in which God comes among us. As Bonhoeffer wrote, "God is beyond in the midst of our life" (308). God is as other from the world, as transcendent and holy, as are the Jews, the children of Israel, and as is the church, the branch grafted onto Israel. Thus God's holiness, his very deity, is at stake in the destiny of his people. God has promised to redeem Israel "for the sake of my holy name" (Ezekiel 36:22), to raise up the dry bones of an exiled and scattered Israel, not for Israel's sake, but, as God says, so that "you shall know that I am the Lord" (Ezekiel 37:6). Deutero Isaiah made the same point when he prom- ised that God would be revealed to the nations as "the Holy One of Israel" (e.g. Isaiah 45). It is as the God who redeems and cares for Israel, as the Holy One of Israel, that God is revealed also to the nations as the one and only God. God is "wholly other" from the Christian, and from the world as such, because and as God is "Jewish," and Jewish is precisely what Gentiles are not. If God is "Jewish," and therein holy, then God is, for instance, not Aryan, not even American; God is not Black, Latin or feminine, nor simply and universally human (were there such). Rather, God is the God of Israel, the holy God who transcends and judges all, the God whom the world can know and of whom it can speak as it first knows and can speak of this wholly other people, the children of Israel. A third attribute is the divine goodness or righteousness. Because the transcendence and immanence of God must be understood his- torically, so must the righteousness of God be understood politically. From this perspective, at issue in the knowledge and obedience of God is less a spiritual salvation than a political deliverance. The</page><page sequence="14">352 Journal of the American Academy of Religion biblical God is a partisan of the oppressed underdog; he liberates Israel, and through Israel humankind, for a true community of justice and peace; he calls his followers less to acts of religious devotion than to individual and corporate responsibility for the politics of God. Those who by God's grace are forgiven and "justified," who are set right with God and so find themselves on God's side, are those who in that very event of their justification are also called and liberated to work with God in the establishment of the divine justice. The experience of Dietrich Bonhoeffer illustrates how the recog- nition of God as the God of Israel reveals the political nature of the divine righteousness. Bonhoeffer was the first and for a time the only major voice of the Confessing Church in Germany to grasp the political implication of the Barmen Declaration of 1934. This early recognition appears to be grounded in Bonhoeffer's singular openness to the Old Testament and his consequent conviction that God has an essential stake in the destiny of his chosen people (TOdt:155). This concern for the Jews, and therefore for the eminently political Jewish question, led Bonhoeffer to call the church to its political obedience and brought him directly into conflict with the Third Reich. Bonhoeffer recognized that in the political reality of the Jewish people, Germany and especially the Christian Church were con- fronted with the historical and political reality of the wholly other God, to whom Bonhoeffer, and in his mind the church, could be faithful ultimately only in a political way. Finally, I would ask about the unity and universality of God. There is only one God, the God of Israel. His integrity, what I have called his holiness, is disclosed as he keeps his word and promises to Israel and proves himself to be their faithful and only God. He is not the champion of any and every revolutionary cause; he is a partisan of his own cause--the cause of Israel. Only as this particular God also becomes the God of all does he become the universal God that he is. The universality of God, the final meaning of his unity, is an eschatological reality-the telos of his history with Israel. For Chris- tians, this universality is assured and promised to all through Jesus Christ. With the Rhineland Synod, Christians confess Jesus Christ, the Jew, "who as the Messiah of Israel is the Christ and savior of the world who binds the peoples of the world with the people of God" (Synodalbeschluss:54). In Jesus Messiah the one God of Israel be- comes the universal God, the God of all. The Religious God The basic contention of religion (as opposed to biblical faith), the proposition that determines all others, is that God is not self-</page><page sequence="15">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 353 determined for Israel, and thus does not take us Gentiles out of our own history to become co-actors in God's covenant history with Israel. The God of religion is not conceived in historical terms, the very notion of which evokes the satire of God as the mythological "large being acting in space and time" (Gilkey, 1980:186). Rather, the God of religion is understood much more "profoundly" and "spiritually" as a metaphysical, transhistorical, and ontological depth, as the presuppo- sition and potentiality of reality, which confronts us at the boundary of existence and is revealed especially in the universal history of religion and in modern religious pluralism. Whereas the "Jewish" God of the Bible is the liberator who strives in the divine history with us to create a new world of love and justice, this higher, more spiritual God of religion may be understood as a "savior" who saves either by delivering one from this evil world of time and history into a spiritual unity with the transcendent being of the divine itself, or by upholding and sustaining the present world through a reaffirmation of the divine as the immanent truth, depth and ground of all being. In both cases, the religious God is found, on the one hand, wholly "outside" or beyond history and the material realities of existence, and on the other hand, wholly "within" the spiritual depths of the inner person. Salvation therefore entails a primarily inward, spiritual unity with the wholly external spiritual depth. As Kraus notes, a "decisive characteristic of religion is the coincidence of inwardness and transcendence" (70). Thus, the quest for salvation can move in either of two directions. In the first instance it is directed toward deity in itself and as such, and the goal is a unity with the divine that "saves" and rescues one from the disunity and estrangement threatening human existence. Salva- tion is then a deliverance from the fragmented surface of life through a new integration with its ground and depth. As suggested by Tillich, in its highest form it is a mystical union with Being-itself in which all the ambiguity and alienation of a life menaced by nonbeing, death, and meaninglessness are overcome. Insofar as it offers this kind of escape from life, religion can be said to have its roots in a sinful human laziness (see Kraus: 456, where he also cites Barth, Church Dogmatics IV, 2). Too tired of the struggle, one seeks in religion to flee the world in a saving experience of the transcendent God of religion. Alternatively, salvation may focus not on God as such, but on God as the ground and possibility of universal human existence and history. Here religion as salvation alleges to reveal in a saving way the meaning and purpose of human existence, and the power of its divine depth; it thus claims to give a viability to life, which otherwise is threatened with meaninglessness and futility. Insofar as its thus pulls</page><page sequence="16">354 Journal of the American Academy of Religion life together, as it were, it has what Kraus designates an "integrating function." This type of religion can be said to be "historical" and even "political" to the extent that it provides not an escape from this world but instead a spiritual foundation and justification of it, including its history and its politics. By explaining human existence and history, by revealing their immanent meaningfulness, religion justifies and "saves" this world and life in it. This form of the religious falsification nevertheless also serves the lazy insofar as it legitimates a satisfaction with this world and discourages one from taking up, in the power of the Holy Spirit, the struggle for the new world promised with the coming of God's kingdom. We might say that religion and its promised salvation provide in the first case a saving escape from the world and, in the second, a saving legitimation of it. In either case, Karl Barth's observation that "religion" in no way contradicts the world is correct (IV,3:711). The God of religion is certainly not "political" in the partisan sense of the biblical God. Viewed religiously, God does not even "exist" at the historical level, where politics are at home. Moreover, unlike the God of the exodus who elects Israel and those who through Jesus Christ join the Israel party, the God of religion is non-partisan. As the ground of all being and history and, as it were, all politics, the divine plays no favorites and is immediately universal and impartial. At least this is the claim. The truth of the matter, however, is that the God of religion is in fact quite partisan. While the biblical God has his own party and program, Israel and the Kingdom of God, the religious God serves the political interests of whatever party prevails in any particular place and time. In the Germany of 1933 "God" was manifest in the so-called German hour, in the German nation and folk, in the pure Aryan, and in the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Karl Marx's observation that there is no humanity-as-such is true, provided we understand that "classes" include not only economic divisions but also races, sexes, nations--a variety of parties always ready (and apparently able) to claim the God of religion as their advocate, or perhaps, in the name of religion, to keep God, the true God, from interfering with their causes. Finally, a word should be said about the holiness or transcen- dence of God in religious perspective. We have seen that the biblical God is holy because of the wholly--otherness and particularity of his politics and because of that history with humankind in which he judges this world and creates a new one. He is transcendent precisely in this election of Israel, in his condescending to enter into the center of our history in solidarity with Israel and the poor and oppressed of our world. With the gods of religion it is otherwise; they are beyond and above life. "These gods," says Kraus, "are the ambitious gods, the</page><page sequence="17">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 355 conceptions of human, all-too-human, ideas of domination and of strivings for superiority projected into transcendence, and who run counter to the direction of the one true God who descends into the depths of human existence" (42). The gods of religion are, for all their alleged transcendence, nevertheless finally quite profane in their apparent ability and willingness to become captive to any prevailing political program, either directly in advocacy, or indirectly in otherworldly indifference. The preceding interpretation of "religion" and natural theology refers implicitly and explicitly to a Christian use of these categories and not to non-Christian religions or their theologies. My argument is that a sinful Christian anti-Judaism that separates Jesus and Christi- anity from Judaism necessarily leads to a so-called "Christian" natural theology and a religious understanding of God, and thus to a falsifi- cation of the Christian revelation. What remains to be demonstrated is precisely how and wherein this process is "sinful." On the assump- tion that Christians lie in order to cover and legitimate their sins, how is sin served by this pattern of "lies"? THE RESULTING SIN When the church is truthful it knows itself to be the community of those who through Jesus Christ have been and are being called into the covenant between God and Israel. In this sense the church is the New Israel, the community of God's adopted children, the wild branches grafted on to the living root. In answering its call, the church, in the power of God's grace, contradicts and overcomes its sin, its proud separation from God, and its "natural" enmity to God's will. But although sin is thus contradicted and overcome, it nevertheless exists on borrowed time and will seize every opportunity to reinforce itself. Typical of the effort of sin to prevail is the Christian lie, which maintains that, after all, Jesus is not really Jewish and that the God he reveals and who calls the church is not the God of the Jews. The consequence of this falsehood is that the church is delivered from the humiliation of having to become Israel's adopted children in order to be saved. It can disregard Calvin's injunction that "when we seek salvation we have to go the promise which was given to our father Abraham; we must be his spiritual children if we would be servants of the church of God, members of our Lord Jesus Christ" (124). The Sin of Pride Now the church can proudly turn the tables and claim that Israel and the Jews must come to the church for their salvation. The promises that Christ fulfills belong to the church first of all and to the</page><page sequence="18">356 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Gentiles who come into the church rather than to the elect of Israel. Christ does not call people to become Israel's adopted children but to become children of the church itself. Of course, we are proud to say, Jews can also become Christians if they should so choose to continue to enjoy the blessings of the covenant. This move in the interest of human pride occurred very early in the life of the church, when it construed the separation between Jesus' followers and Judaism as evidence that God had rejected Israel as his partner and given the covenant to the church. Frank Musser, following the Jewish scholar Jules Isaac, shows how such anti- Judaism exploited this separation to insinuate itself into the early Church's self-consciousness as it formulated the Gospel tradition. According to Isaac and Musser, the early conflict between Christianity and Judaism was the Sitz im Leben of the gathering and redaction of the Jesus materials, which led "with almost natural necessity to an increasingly anti-Jewish accentuation of these materials and to the construction of 'Feinbilder' (especially of the Pharisees)" (Musser:53). The allusion to "an almost natural necessity" recognizes the necessity or logic of nature (or sin), not of faith. The Christian truth of Jesus as the Messiah of Israel through whom Gentiles are called into covenant between Israel and God, which the Jews finally could not accept and which led to the separation between Judaism and Christianity, be- comes the opportunity for the Christian lie that God has rejected the Jews and established the church as a justly proud and independent institution of salvation. This boastful contention likely occasioned Paul's warning in the Epistle to the Romans of the danger of boasting: "If some of the branches were broken off [alluding to Israel's refusal to accept Christ] and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive tree, do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that it is not you who support the root, but the root who supports you" (Romans 11:17-18). In and of itself the wild branch has no life and is without the knowledge of God; it has no ground for boasting except in the root from which it receives its life. In language reminiscent of Second Isaiah, Paul must remind the Corinthians, who also were chronically disposed to boasting, that "God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God" (I Cor. 1:27). Endemic and natural to the church as such, regarded apart from Jesus Christ, is only its sin, which, apart from the grace of the God of Israel, is always there and looking for its opportunity, as in the church at Corinth. The truth that God comes to Gentiles through the Messiah of Israel, through the one who breaks</page><page sequence="19">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 357 down the wall between Jews and Gentiles so that Gentiles may be included in Israel's covenant, as Paul so well recognized, is "foolish- ness." It was and remains a consummate offense to human pride that in order to be God's people the Church must identify with God's chosen people, whom other peoples and nations can but recognize as "despised and rejected," and especially with their Messiah. Nothing better serves human and ecclesial pride and resists this humiliation than the lie that separates Jesus as Christ and Lord of the church from the Jews and their Messianic hope. This self-deception allows the church to imagine itself to be a free, independent, self-conscious institution of salvation that can boast of itself over the root in which it lives and without which it has no life. Thus, from its beginning the church reveals a tendency toward a sinful self-centered ecclesiasticism, and this pride is rationalized by anti-Semitism, which denies the dependence of the church on Jesus the Jew, as well as on his Judaism. The coincidence of anti- Jewishness and ecclesiastical pride is nowhere so painfully manifest in modem times, or in any time, than in the German Church during the period of national socialism. In 1928, on the eve of the rise of Hitler, Bishop Dibelius triumphantly declared the 20th century to be "the century of the church." "The Christian Churches," he wrote, "stand at the beginning of a new epoch. They are gathering their strength. They dare to undertake new tasks. They are driven forward by new responsibilities. The spiritual situation of the world demands its labors. .... We have only to ask what is God's command for this hour which is given to us. And we hear as his command just one word, and that word is 'Church' " (Kupisch:230,234). In this same spirit, just a few years later, German Christians were united in their enthusiasm for the establishment of a new united evangelical (Protestant) church, one that was to have the backing and support of Hitler himself. "The goal of the faith movement, 'German Christians,' is an evangelical German state (Reich) church. The state of Adolf Hitler calls for the church, the church must hear this call" (Wolf:50). And this was to be a "German" church, proud and independent. Therefore, according to the so-called Aryan paragraph of the German Christian platform (which became the law of the Prussian Church), it was to be a church that excluded "non-Aryans'-i.e., Jews, who were not really Germans and would prevent the church from being truly and proudly German and independent. Even the confessing church, established in 1934 at Barmen, did not escape ecclesiasticism. It addressed itself only to the question of the integrity and truth of the Church and initially attempted to avoid political questions. Not coincidentally, therefore, the Barmen Decla- ration failed to address the Jewish question; it ignored both the Aryan</page><page sequence="20">358 Journal of the American Academy of Religion paragraph, which excluded Jewish Christians from service in the church, and the situation of German Jewry as such. The Sin of Indolence and Sloth The ironic otherside of the sin of the prideful, self-consciousness ecclesiasticism is the sin of laziness, in which the church does not begin to rise to the heights of its calling as Christ's church. Inwardly, this sin is experienced as a quiescent, conservative satisfaction with and consent to the status quo, whether explicitly and actively or tacitly and passively, whether as a sin of commission or as a sin of omission. Outwardly it results in and is expressive of the church's bondage to the world. If those who come into the church do not find themselves transposed into the covenant with Israel, if the situation of Israel before God is not the situation of the church, then the church has no choice but to find itself in its situation in the world. If it is not called out of its own history as a part of the world's history, into the revolutionary, world changing history of God and his people, then it is "free" only to live out the story of the world, either silently by default or confessedly in abject support of that world. Similarly, as we have noted, so-called natural theology tends to rationalize the status quo of human existence and history and, at best, fails to help the church understand and to rise to its calling as God's exodus people. Gods who are natural to this world, who are construed as the final truth of the world, scarcely occasion the church's rising to the cause of a new world. An independent and self-conscious ecclesiasticism, together with its correlate of either an abstract ecclesiastical or natural theol- ogy, immediately becomes an abjectly dependent church-too tired, too indolent and too captive to live up to its mission as the people of Jesus the Messiah. This other side of the coin is again apparent in the case of the German Church, especially during the period of national socialism. In 1925 Bishop Dibelius argued that to answer its call, the church "cannot be an international society of a Christian sort, but a humanity that builds itself up out of the nations, in which every national group comprehends Christian faith in its own way and stamps it with its own style. The commitment to love the neighbor makes the national community (Volksgemeinschaft) the obligation of everyone, since for us the brother in one's own people is always the neighbor" (Kupisch:232). Similarly, we recall that the German Christians de- fined the goal of the faith movement as "an evangelical German state Church .... ," which would be truly "German," exclusive of non- Aryans. The church, they contended, is not subject to God's law as exemplified in the Old Testament because the Old Testament is, in</page><page sequence="21">Osborn: The Christian Blasphemy 359 fact, not the law of God for everyone, but only for Israel; it is merely an example of the way that God calls every nation and people. "He called Israel to its particular history.... He calls each people to its particular mission" (Sasse:28). A gospel that is not stamped by Jesus Christ with the experience and history of Israel can only bear the mark of the nation. In pre-war Germany, the church necessarily became German. Instead of being subject exclusively to Jesus Christ, it fell subject to the will of the "creator," to his law as manifest in the history of the German nation and Volk. Even the Young Reformers, who were not numbered among the German Christians, could state as a part of their guiding theses that the Evangelical Church should, "in full freedom from all political influences and in a joyful yes to the new German state, fulfill its God-given duty and bind itself at the same time in an indissoluble service to the German Volk" (Wolf:44). The will of God was thought to be heard in this German hour, "in the particular historical moment of the family, the people and the race, that is, in a particular moment of their history" (Wolf: 101). The church was to shoulder the destiny of the German people. "Germany is our task, Christ is our strength" (Wolf: 109). Is it formally different when a contemporary American theologian claims that "it is necessary to appropriate God's acts from our situation," or that "our theology must make sense of our experience, of the world we live in" (Gardiner:214)? Is not the world, our present historical situation, then setting the task of church and theology, for which Christ may then be invoked as the source of strength? Whereas the German theologians of 1933 saw the fulfilment of the will of the creator in the German hour and the rise of national socialism, a contemporary theology can claim to "have seen in the advent of secularism the fulfillment of the will of the creator." The church "must learn to listen to secular man, and must listen to him hon- estly... with a willingness to learn both about the world and about the meaning of the faith it confesses." The view that sees revelation as "channelled through Scripture and the institutional churches" is too narrow and restricted; "it fails to take seriously the work and purpose of the Creator" (Gardiner:2 13, emphasis mine). In the name of the Creator, the church must listen to the world; it sets the agenda, speaks for God, determines the criteria of the church's relevance in the modem world. Is this kind of natural theology any more able today than it was in 1933 to call the church to itself, to call it out of its situation in the world to take its place in God's struggle in and against the world on behalf of a new world? Is the church of God served by a theology that deliberately seeks to "move outside the walls of the church and into the broad arena of the world, where our deepest attitudes about what is real and true are formed" (Gilkey, 1969:232)?</page><page sequence="22">360 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Doubtless the church must move outside its walls, but is it into the broad arena of the world that it should move? Actually, of course, it cannot so move. As Dibelius perhaps unintentionally observed, a church that does not move into God's historic struggle with the world moves and must move into a particular part of the world itself-which for Dibelius was the nation, the Volk. Does the modern church fare any better? Abstracted from the people of God, does it become free in the name of God to serve all, or does it not in fact become the dependent voice of the dominant powers of the status quo, serving them either directly and intentionally, or indirectly and implicitly by its irrelevant and pointless abstraction into "the broad arena of the world"? In itself and as such the church is an abstraction. Its actuality and existence are found in the service it renders. The church either in the name of Christ serves the cause of God and his kingdom as revealed and realized in the history of his chosen people, or, allegedly in the name of Christ, but by falsifying his truth, serves the world. In fact, the church exists in the struggle for its truth against this lie. The lie serves sin and the devil well. By appearing to legitimate a self- conscious ecclesiasticism, it effects a church which either by its ecclesiastical preoccupation leaves the world alone or with its so- called natural theology provides a tacit if not explicit legitimation of this world as it is. In both cases the church denies and defies the new for which God in Christ and through his chosen people has been and is still struggling. The anti-Jewish fabrications of the church serve the sinful pride and the indolence of the church, both of which render it subject to the principalities and powers of this age and contradict its true being and calling as the New Israel, as the adopted children of God and covenant partners with God in Jesus Christ in the fight for a new world, a new humanity, a new heaven, and a new earth.
