The most prominent conceptual designs and conspicuous pictorial motifs of these drawings will be examined. The motifs, read as distinct graphical signs, can be subsumed under a limited number of groupings. Despite their surface diversity, all shamanic drum drawings of the Northern Magar display a common line of function and meaning, emerging from a pool of local religious ideas that will be alluded to where necessary. In order to emphasize the originality of the Northern Magar Himalayan drum drawings, some examples of a similar type from a much larger area of distribution shall first be considered: drawings found on drums ascribed to the classical tradition of Siberian shamanism in North Asia. The Siberian samples chosen from this vast area in the North are not intended to suggest a historical and cultural continuity with the Himalayan samples from the more restricted South Asian region, but they do help make the formal analysis of the latter somewhat easier. Yet the occasional affinity between Siberian and Himalayan pictorial expression on shamanic drums invites conjecture and speculation. Siberian exemplars If one were to picture a drum drawing most characteristically "shamanic," a figuration would probably come to mind similar to the one published in 1730 by von Strahlenberg, the Swedish traveler to Siberia: a microcosmic rendering of a tripartite universe, applied in horizontal strata onto the circular surface of the drum's membrane (fig. 2). This type of painting was prevalent among the Turkic Barabin of the southwestern Siberian steppe, and with slight modifications, it was also prevalent among the peoples of the Altai Mountains. Figure 2 shows in its upper section three four-legged animals with three crosses above them, an ornitho anthropomorphic figure with outstretched wings, and three heavenly bodies. In its lower section, a bow-and arrow hunter mounted on a four-legged riding-animal, a bristly quadruped, a frog, and two trees can be distinguished. These two figurative planes are separated from one another by a horizontal braid: a band formed by two parallel lines and inscribed by a geometrical configuration of two mirrorlike zigzags that create a row of lozenges and two symmetrical rows of triangles. This braid with its double zigzag pattern separating the upper from the lower registers of the drawing is called "the earth," whereas another braiding made of a single zigzag inside an arch of two vaulted parallels and rising above the horizontal braid is referred to as "heaven's belt." Thus, as a whole, the pictorial arrangement represents a complete triple-layered cosmography: at the top, framed by the vaulted and horizontal braids, the upper world; in the middle, indicated by the horizontal braid itself, the middle or human world; and in the lower (and largest) section, the underworld. Simultaneously, the Barabin drum drawing introduces all the necessary helping spirits and auxiliary devices that the drumming shaman needs in his s?ances to reach the extraterrestrial realms where he negotiates with the supernatural beings for the benefit of his clients. The three depicted celestial bodies?sun, full moon, and Evening Star?plus the three stars represented by three crosses, serve him as points of orientation during his ritual journeys through the universe. The three four-legged animals in the upper section and the one he is sitting on in the lower section are the shaman's vehicles on his trip. The birdman in the upper register is his constant companion during the s?ance and functions as pathfinder and scout. The frog in the underworld section is porter of the shaman's gift offerings to the supernatural; additionally, the frog acts as the healer's translator, for he can speak the language of the subterranean realm. The underworld's bristly monster (alternately identified as a mammoth, a porcupine, or a wild boar) devours everything that stands in the shaman's way; whereas the two trees (birches or larches) serve the shaman as ladders to reach the heavenly spheres (Di?szegi and Lot-Falck 1973: 27, 32-42). In sum, the Barabin drum drawing visualizes in three superimposed layers prevailing topographical ideas about a tripartite shamanic cosmos at the same time as it offers an image of all those beings within it that are of use for the shaman. While many shamanic drums of Northern Asia, such as those of certain Yakut, Buryat, Mongolian, Karagassian, and Eastern Tungu groups, carry no depictions at all, those of the Finno-Ugrian tribes that do carry depictions frequently evade any division of the drum's surface. On certain Sel'kup drums, however, an abstract lizard drawn</page><page sequence="3">64 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 Figure 2.

Sunwar drum drawing: female side in concentric, semicosmological layout (after Fournier, 1976:109). from the top to the bottom of the drumskin marks a clear lateral division that separates the surface of the membrane vertically into two equal parts and distinguishes left from right (fig. 3) (Ivanov 1954: 70, 71, 73). Moreover, the two lateral zones are given an asymmetrical touch by equivalent, yet different, signs on either side. Even if these may be astral?a sun on the left and a half-moon on the right?such drawings lack an overall cosmographical intention. They are meant to depict human faces with Archimboldian compositional elements, that is, elements not chosen from human anatomy. The principle of division and its intended perspective varies once again on some preserved shamanic drum drawings of the Transbaikalian Tungu tribes. Instead of being laterally divided (as are the Sel'kup drawings) or horizontally layered (as are the cosmological drawings of the Altaians and the Barabin) these drawings are concentric. Figure 4 illustrates a Tungu drum whose surface is almost entirely occupied by animal portraits? beings of the "Middle World" (in other words, the earth). Around this middle world of animals (and man)?and close to the edge of the drum frame?runs a bordering belt of lozenges framed by two parallel lines. This border has been interpreted by Ivanov as a stylization of the bodies of two snakes, in which the rhombs represent the snakes' scales (Ivanov 1954: 316; discussed by Lot-Falck 1961: 40-42)?a suggestion that finds support in a common concept in Tungu cosmology according to</page><page sequence="4">Oppitz: Drawings on shamanic drums 65 which the world is girded by two snakes. A more manifest explanation identifies this circular borderline with a chain of mountains, an identification that has also been given for the serrated horizontal division on the Barabin drums: "les dents de scie symbolisent les montagnes" (Lot-Falck 1961: 29). In fact, the visualization of the demarcation line between two cosmic spheres by means of the most striking geographical features?by a chain of mountains? is a very frequent device in Asian art. The same device is also employed in drawings on shamanic drums of the Himalayan region. East Himalayan exemplars: Sunwar The faith healers, or puimbo, of the Sunwar of East Nepal use drums whose standardized drawings, concentric in design, are framed on the outer rim by geometrical symbolizations of mountains. The Sunwar shaman's drum, or dhy?ngrp belongs to one of two basic Himalayan types of drum construction. One type resembles Siberian drums in that it comprises a wooden frame?a Rahmentrommel?that is covered by a membrane on only one of its two sides, the other side being left open. This type, which may be called the Dhaulagiri drum because its distribution is roughly restricted to the region of the Dhaulagiri Massif, has its handle inside the frame. The other type, designated as the Eastern Nepalese shamanic drum because it is found in the Nepalese Hills east of the Dhaulagiri type (Oppitz 1990: 81-82), is strung with a membrane on both sides of the wooden frame, and its wooden handle is attached to the outside of the frame in a vertical position. It roughly resembles the Tibetan drum called rnga. The Sunwar shamanic drum, which belongs to this latter, two-sided type, is decorated on both membranes: one surface is referred to as the male side, the other as the female side. The drawings on both sides have identical perspectives, but in terms of the motifs employed they are distinct, although related (figs. 5, 6). The female side of the Sunwar faith healer's drum is illustrated with a considerable number of joint rhombic shapes around its edge (fig. 5). These rhombs are cut in half by a circular middle line, thus forming a double number of triangles pointing inward and outward. The triangles pointing toward the center are locally interpreted as "the mountains," whereas those pointing toward the edge are referred to as "the valleys"; the dividing line in between represents "the rivers" (Fournier 1976:109-111). It may be added that these "rivers," "valleys," and "mountains" in the circumferential decoration stand for those of the human world, as evident features of the Himalayan landscape. Over the peaks of the mountains, toward the center, a circular row of dotted points indicates the stars of the Milky Way. In the very center of the membrane an octagon is drawn, composed by two intersecting crosses made of lozenges. One of these rhombic crosses is drawn with whitewash, the other with the reddish paint of the dubi plant. This central geometrical figure represents Venus in both its aspects? as Morning Star (white) and as Evening Star (red).1 From each tip of the white cross additional sets of four dots extend toward the circle of Milky Way "points." These sixteen dots also stand for stars in the sky. On the male side of the drum, the exterior edge is framed by a simple zigzag line of triangles, again representing "mountains on the edge of the world" (fig. 6). Every other peak of this circular mountain chain is touched by the tip of a garland. Although it cannot be detected in this reproduction, the garland is drawn with six narrowly superimposed lines that represent the rainbow. Farther toward the center, a circle of dotted points indicates the Milky Way, just as on the female side. But the center of the drawing on the male side is dominated by a tris?l, the sign of 5iva, who in these parts of the Nepalese Hills is considered as a patron of the jh?kri, or shamanic healers. The pictorial construction out of which the trident grows suggests an altar. To the left of diva's emblem a radiant sun is placed; to its right, a waning moon. On account of its concentric nature, in other words, on purely formal grounds, the drawing on the Sunwar drum2 may be compared to the Tungu example mentioned above, which is also concentric in its conceptual design. But whereas toward the Tungu drum the spectator takes an extraterrestrial vantage point?because he looks down on earth, which is enclosed by an exterior chain of mountains?the spectator's position toward the Sunwar drum is inverted: he looks up from earth into the firmament through a hole encircled by mountains. In other words, what is missing on the Tungu drum?the sky, because it is beyond the surface of the membranophone? moves right into the center of the Sunwar drum. And the reverse is the case with the earth: central on the Tungu drum, it is only half present on that of the Sunwar (in the guise of circumferential mountains). 1. A double representation of the Morning Venus and the Evening Venus on one and the same drum is also reported from the Teleut. See Dyrenkova 1949:118-119; and Mandoki 1968:491. 2. The Sunwar drum decoration under discussion seems to be highly stereotyped; it can be found with slight modification also among the Limbu of East Nepal. See Sagant 1976: 89.</page><page sequence="5">66 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 In regard to the depiction of the three elementary spherical regions, basic to so many shamanic worldviews, both the Sunwar and the Tungu drum drawings are incomplete, because they each lack at least one of them. As opposed to the horizontally layered drum drawings of the Barabin, which are fully cosmological, one might call these concentric views of the Tungu and Sunwar semicosmological. Whereas the Tungu drum represents only the middle sphere and its limits, leaving outside its confines both extraterrestrial realms, the Sunwar drum, locating the upper world in the center and the middle world on its edge, banishes the underworld to the space outside the drum altogether. This latter form of incomplete cosmography also prevails on certain shamanic drums of the Northern Magar, which will be discussed now at length. West Himalayan exemplars: Magar The drum of the Magar shaman, or ramm?, is locally called r?or r?gor. In its construction it can stand as the model for the Dhaulagiri type of the magic healer's drum: a wooden frame, stretched with a wild goat hide on only one of its two sides and a pair of crossed-over bamboo handles loosely attached to its interior. The drawings on this type of drum are found exclusively on the exterior side of the single membrane. The technique of application is simple. The painter dips an index finger into a small bowl of prepared liquid chalk that is then applied with bare fingers onto the surface of the membrane. While wet, the lime paint is matte and gray, but when dried over an open fire the chalk lines turn to a clear white. Once applied, a drawing may stay on a drum for several months before time and use wash it away. Strictly speaking, there is only one annual occasion on which the renewal of a drum's painting is obligatory: during the big initiation ceremonies in the month of bais?kh (April/May). On these outstanding social and ritual occasions, all shamans of the surrounding villages gather for a period of three days to test and accredit the initiates in the shamanic profession, and each of their drums is painted anew (fig. 7). The drum drawings may also be renewed during the rest of the year, in the course of the larger healing s?ances. Two types of people may execute the drawings: either the shamans themselves or, preferably, their helpers, referred to as celme. These helpers invariably belong to a fixed social class: they must be wife-receivers of the ritual's beneficiaries. In a healing s?ance, the beneficiaries are the patient and his family; in an initiation they are the neophyte and his patrilineal group. According to Magar kinship theory and alliance practice, each man has three distinct types of relatives: his own patrilineal kin among which marriages may under no circumstances be contracted; his mother's brother's group, which provides him with a wife; and his sister's son's group, which he provides with a daughter for marriage. The group toward which he functions as donor of a wife regards him as being higher in rank; the one from which he receives a wife regards him as being in a lower position. From the group that regards him as wife-giver he can expect lifelong services, in particular manual and lowly ones, whereas the group toward which he functions as a wife receiver must in turn be served by him. One set of occasions to fulfill the serving duties of the wife-receiver are the shamanic events held for the benefit of one's wife givers. To paint the drum of a shaman who has been invited into a client's house is one specific case of a wife receiver's service toward the donor of his wife. Thus the painting of a drum, if not executed by the shaman himself, is more than just a ritual and a religious job: it is additionally a social act prescribed by and reflecting the rules of the alliance system. The motifs of the drawings painted on Magar shamanic drums display a considerable range of variety. The specific choice made for one drum at a particular time seems relatively independent of the occasion on which the drawing is applied, with two notable exceptions: (1) when an adult has had an accident, or (2) when after an infant's death a new baby has been born into a household. Both cases represent situations when spirits are involved that can cause an untimely death. Therefore, long exorcising rituals must be absolved in both situations by a shaman, in the course of which an invariable drawing is painted on the acting healer's drum: a magical bar (fig. 19) that bans these particular spirits from the confines of the human habitat. Yet none of the many other drum drawings employed in Magar shamanism is markedly specific for any of the singular ritual occasions. The seemingly unsystematic use of drum drawings among the Magar forestalls the conclusion that all Magar drum drawings have a common functional base, independent of their individual shape. This stands in contrast to the customs of Southern Siberian Altai Kizi who had a custom according to which the drawings painted on shamanic drums changed in accordance with the type of ceremony. Once a ritual was over, the distinct drawings applied on a drum for that occasion were washed off (Alekseev 1987: 212). Among the Siberian Yenisseians the number of drawn figures retained on a drum reflected the power of its holder. A young and inexperienced shaman's drum was bare of any drawn</page><page sequence="6">Oppitz: Drawings on shamanic drums 67 Figure 6.

Copied from Shamaness Cukmaya's drum. motif, whereas that of an old and powerful shaman was rich in decoration (Lot-Falck 1961: 38). And among the KaCins of Southern Siberia, it was a declared purpose of the sacred symbols drawn on drums to inform the public about the magic power of the drum's owner: because this power differed individually, the drawings also differed (Alekseev 1987: 225). There is nothing of this in the decorations of Magar drums. Any shaman can have any motif painted on his drum at any time from the local pictorial repertoire. The range of Magar drum drawings illustrated here is based on my personal observations; consequently, it will hardly be exhaustive. Altogether, I have traced ten different types of drawings that can be grouped into four distinct categories: (1) cosmological drawings on drums, (2) drums on drums, (3) ritual items on drums, and (4) sexual motifs on drums. The first of these categories, the cosmological one, comprises two types (I and II); the second, three types (III to V); the third, two types (VI and VII); and the last, with erotic pictorial matter, again three types (VIII to X). As will be shown, the passages from one of these categories to the next are smooth. Magar Types I and II: Cosmological drawings on drums The drawings on the shamanic drums of the Magar in the Dhaulagiri Region that can be classed as cosmographical in their subject matter resemble in their basic conceptual features those of the East Nepalese Sunwar: both are concentric and semicosmological. Two subtypes can be distinguished. Type I (fig. 8) displays on its outer circuit a panorama of zigzags that, according to local interpretation, may be read as the border chain of mountains around the earth. On a smaller radius, a Figure 7. The painter's act: application of wet chalk on the drum by a Magar wife-receiver.

Finally, in the center, a circle enclosing a semicircle renders the sun and moon, possibly in an ecliptic position. In such a manner the tripartite universe is represented on the Magar drum in an incomplete fashion, just as on the previously mentioned Sunwar drum. A circular chain of mountains symbolizing the middle world separates the upper from the lower world, although only the upper world is incorporated into the picture (in the center, inside the earthly chain of mountains), whereas the realm of the underworld is only virtually present, outside the confines of the drum's frame. A variation on this semicosmological and concentric disposition can be seen on Type II (fig. 9). In this drawing the upper world of the firmament is again placed in the center, which in its turn is bordered by a circular zigzag of mountains representing the middle world; once again the underworld is banished from the picture. Yet the stars of the sky, instead of encircling the sun and moon, merely occupy the lower part of the central section of the membrane as loosely scattered small circles. Above the stars, the sun and moon rise, separate and specified?the sun with rays and the moon waxing. Finally, the demarcation between earth and sky, a zigzag chain of terrestrial mountains framing the astral center, is reinforced by a circular line, which is omitted on the drawing of Type I. This inconspicuous circumferential line between mountains and stars is not without significance, for it sanctions an alternative reading of the unaltered picture. According to this second interpretation, the whole drawing changes its meaning to the same degree as its constituent parts change theirs. The circular line between terrestrial mountains and astral bodies turns from a spherical demarcation into a microcosmic boundary?the rim of a drum frame?while the former zigzag of mountains shrinks to the zigzag of leather strings that normally stretch the hide of a membrane over a drum's wooden frame. Such bracing strings are locally referred to as t?n?, meaning "loom," "row of houses," "relations," and "thongs for tying." In the shamanic rituals, such leather thongs that tie the membrane of a drum over its frame play an important role as indicators in drum divination (Oppitz 1981:151 ; Oppitz 1990: 93-95). In Magar creation myths concerning the first drum and its parts, the helpers of the proto-shaman searched for an adequate tying string. After several materials were rejected, the hide of an ox named Candrakheye turned out to be the right material: this was the same ox whose blood had served to consecrate the drum frame of the first Figure 10. Pendants on Magar shamanic armor: iron sun and moon. Drawing: Robert Powell. healer. The special terms for the drum?candrakheye regor? and for the strings?candrakheye t?n??allude to this creation myth. Up to this point, it may have become clear that the drawing of Type II, inasmuch as its exterior constituent parts are interpreted in different fashions, also changes its meaning as a whole. According to the first reading, it depicts large parts of the macrocosmic world; according to the second reading, it shows a mere drum, drawn on a real drum. Even the celestial bodies in the center of the picture, unchanged as such, change their contextual position. Although they still signify the sun, moon, and stars (as in the first interpretation), in the second reading they have become the sun, moon, and stars as drawn on a drum, which itself is drawn on a drum: they turn from a picture of what they represent into a picture of this representation. This distinction has consequences. Following the first interpretation, the celestial bodies are reminders: they remind the spectator that the world of the shaman is transcendental. Moreover, they remind the spectator of another creation myth according to which an original numerical surplus of nine suns and nine moons caused the world's immediate destruction after it had just come into being; thus the spectator is reminded of the necessity of an ecological equilibrium in the cosmos as a precondition for the well-being of man on earth. Following the second interpretation, the celestial bodies are efficacious signs: they can avert dangers in the same way as the iron replicas of the nine mythical suns and moons that hang suspended from each shaman's professional costume or armor can avert dangers (fig. 10). Tied to his bearskin belt, these iron models of the sun and moon protect the healer in his s?ance against the attacks</page><page sequence="8">Oppitz: Drawings on shamanic drums 69 of the nine insidious witch-sisters. Thus, rather than being seen as mere astral signs, these suns and moons drawn on the drum are part and parcel of the shaman's danger averting equipment. Magar Types III to V: Drums on drums As the Magar Type II drawing has shown, some of the drum pictures can be classified, depending on the viewpoint taken, under one of two categories of motifs: they fall into either the category of "cosmos on drums" or that of "drums on drums." This latter group of motifs is by far the most frequent among the shamanic drum drawings of the Northern Magar. It has a relatively wide range of individual fashioning, as can be deduced from Types II to V (figs. 9, 11,13,14). Most of these Types (III to V; figs. 11, 13,14) do not overlap into other categories (as does Type II); they simply represent, each in their own way, drums drawn on drums. In Type III (fig. 11), the drum representation is located in the center of the picture, whereas a ring of small circles on the outermost radius represents a set of cowrie shells. The graphic elements that embody the drum and its parts are the following: a large circular line stands for the hoop; circles or triangles around it stand for the tying strings or t?n?; a cross in the middle stands for the two crossed drum handles, which in the real Magar drum are fixed in the interior of the wooden frame; and four small circles in the spaces between the cross-arms stand for either another set of cowrie shells or for offering gifts to be distributed into the four directions, depending on the viewpoint taken. Cowrie shells, like the iron suns and moons discussed above, in conjunction with drawing Type II, are indispensable pieces on a shaman's armor. Cowries are sewn in geometrical arrangements on the healer's bearskin belt. The belt itself consists of three parts: a broad band around the waist and two thinner shoulder straps crossed over the chest (fig. 12); each part carries cowries in great number. The cowries and other pendants attached to the belt, such as iron and copper bells, animal carcasses, and wild boar tusks, fulfill similar functions? all are protective tools for the shaman when he travels through the universe on his soul-searching journeys. As is clearly expressed in a few lines from a popular epic chant recounting the deeds of the first shaman, Ramma Puran Tsan, the proto-shaman is always protected at his waist against the attacks of malignant spirits by cowrie shells sewn on his leather belt. In a sneering tone he provokes his negative counterparts, the nine witch sisters, as they try to bite off pieces of his body in an attempt to devour him: ramm? puran can l?i If you want to gnaw o w? namni kaira Ramma Puran Tsan from his waist banp? kaudi otio He is protected by his cowries banm? kaudi otio of the male and female jungle3 jorai piti otio Ramma Puran Tsan is protected ramm? puran can l?i by a double belt A simplified version of the "drums on drums" theme, as compared to that shown in figure 11, can be seen in figure 13, Type IV. Here the surface of the drum drawn on the drum is not divided into four sections by a cross representing drum handles but rather is left undivided. Instead of four small circles representing cowries, nine such circles occupy the center of the drawing, representing nine baked offering breads or bares. In real performed ritual, nine such miniature offering breads are deposited at the end of a drum repair ceremony into a circular hole dug out of the soil. The hole is then covered by the newly strung drum. Thus the drum contains and protects the breads, as indicated on the drawing, before they are symbolically offered as gifts to the spirits of the uncultivated soil. The nine miniature offering breads as drawn on the drum in figure 13 also play a role in shamanic lore. In the same epic chant quoted above, it is stated that in order to banish the spiritual foes of man from human settlement, the proto-shaman Ramma Puran Tsan makes an offering of bares to the nine evil witches at a crossroad. In a malicious gesture, he confuses the witches by giving them at first only eight offering breads so that they do not know how to make up equal shares for all nine of them; only after he has conceded them a ninth share of offering bread are they ready to leave the country. d?wai kara j?ni With his right hand b?wai kara j?ni with his left hand nauai roti j?l?i He threw eight breads away caud?h?rta khyezyeo out on the crossroad ?thai roti j?l?i Of the nine breads to be thrown caud?h?rla khyewo out on the crossroad dhanna nau bainir?i The unfortunate nine sisters dhanna gon?mer?i the unfortunate witches jeth? ye n?n? ni Divided down by age band? lain?jera their shares 3. The expression "cowries of the jungle'' is an intended euphemism. Normally, cowrie shells have to be imported, bought on the Indian markets of the south; the oral lore passes over this fact by suggesting that there are also cowries in the nearby jungle, which a neophyte can see in a visionary dream; upon his will they will come flying onto his new shamanic costume.</page><page sequence="9">70 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 Figure 11.

Provided they are willing to return the abducted vital forces of his patient, the shaman in return will treat them well, with generous gifts of food. Thus, implanted in such tiny, graphic signs is a whole mythological complex, a whole shamanic vision about the relations between man and the spirit world. As sign ?fiers, these simple graphic shapes are not stable. Repeatedly employed on four different drum drawings, the single graphic sign of small circles could assume multiple lexical meaning. On Types I and II, such circles incarnate the stars of the Milky Way; on Types III and IV, either cowrie shells or offering breads as spirit food; and in slightly larger size, on Types III and IV, they stood for the tying thongs of a drum.4 The concrete meaning that a single graphic sign of this type may take in Figure 12. Magar shaman with cowrie belt. Photo: Michael Oppitz. a given pictorial context cannot be deciphered from its shape alone. Its exact position in the whole picture, its numerical distribution, and a vast mythological and religious background are needed to determine the ephemeral significance it may take. A final variation on the "drums on drums" theme in the repertoire of Magar membranophonic painting can be seen in Type V (fig. 14). The design is clear and simple, schematic and symmetrical. One large circle is sectioned by a large cross into four quarters, in each of which the 4. It goes without saying that in more remote cultural contexts arbitrary graphic elements such as small circles will tend to assume even more divergent meanings. Among the Tuva of Southern Siberia, for instance, small circles drawn on the rim of a shaman's drum indicate the speckles of a reindeer calf, whose hide is used for the membrane.

Almost exactly the same pattern?with a few additional details?can be detected on the exterior hide of a shamanic drum of the Southern Siberian Altai Kizi (fig. 15), as reproduced by Jochelson and first discussed by Potanin (Jochelson 1908: 58; Potanin 1883: figs. 68, 69). Again one large cross subdivides the surface of the drum into four equal sectors in each of which a crossed circle depicts a smaller drum. Each sector is enriched by two additional spirals, whereas the large cross contains an additional, smaller drum sketch. On the interior side of this Southern Siberian drumskin, two more drum motifs can be made out, along with a real wooden drum handle in an anthropomorphic shape (fig. 16). These Siberian drum images are also very simple and schematic?circles inscribed with crosses, with dots in the empty quarter sections?which brings them into a formal affinity with the Magar Type III. In other parts of the vast Siberian domain of shamanic expression, different solutions to the "drums on drums" theme have been attempted. Only two will be mentioned here in passing. The drawing on the drum of a Koibal shaman (fig. 17) as recorded in 1896 by Katanov on a journey into the Minusinsk district (reproduced by Alekseev 1987: 230) displays a conceptual arrangement similar to that of the Barabin drawing mentioned at the beginning of this essay: a cosmological image of a tripartite universe shown in three horizontal layers. Depicted at the top is the heavenly world with the sun, moon, Venus, and stars expressly marked out; below, a horizontal zigzag represents the earth in between; and in the sector beneath the earth (the largest sector), the underworld is shown filled with all kinds of beings: a sacred birch tree; an anthropomorphic mountain spirit; six yellow virgins in a row; water and mountain spirits in the guise of a frog, a lizard, two snakes, and an unidentified figure; a shaman on a riding animal, holding bow and arrow; a wolf; prophetic black birds in the state of takeoff; seven black men in a row; two mountain spirits in the guise of animals; and finally two anthropomorphic figures, one in the vertical axis and one near the bottom on the right, both playing shamanic drums. The drumming figure in the axis represents the patron spirit of the shaman; the other drumming figure stands for the shaman himself. In other words, the drums drawn on this Koibal drum are executed figuratively together with their holders. The drum and its player in the vertical axis are given a central position in the whole picture. Moreover, with its connecting lines from top to bottom this central drum drawn on the drum serves to divide the image into two lateral sides reaching from the bottom of the underworld through the earthly stratum to the top of the heavenly sphere. By way of this central drum, the eyes of the spectator are guided through the three cosmic spheres much in the same way as a real drum guides the traveling shaman through the universe. In a drawing on a shamanic drum of the Abakan Tatars in the Altai, as reproduced by Harva and recently by Findeisen and Gehrts (Harva 1938: 531; Findeisen and Gehrts 1983:123), a drum motif is sketched on the lower right of the drumskin (fig. 18). This motif, reproducing in light abstraction the picture drawn in large onto the entire membrane, shows an anthropomorphic figure with outstretched arms, the "master of the drum," who in the interior of the drum hoop is represented once more as a sculpted wooden drum handle with outstretched arms made of iron on which are hung metallic pendants. The outstretched arms of the anthropomorphic "master of the drum" serve in the large drawing as a cosmic divide: above them sun, moon, Venus, and stars can be seen. The bow line in the middle is said to depict a rainbow, whereas the birch and the maral-deer in the lower left each represent material aspects of the drum before its fabrication: the birch is regarded as the tree from which the drum frame is made; the maral, the deer whose skin delivers the drum's membrane. Parallel to the drum drawn on the drum one can thus see a potential drum in its untouched vegetal and zoological state. This last Siberian example of the "drums on drums" theme may offer one of the possible explanations for the widespread use of the motif. The secret power of a shaman's drum is naturally concentrated in its interior, on the side of its handle, on the side of the acting shaman who handles it. If these interior parts of the drum, normally seen only by the healer, are copied onto its outside, as done in the Abakan example where the anthropomorphic figure serves as drum handle, a transfer takes place to the exterior, which is the side of the audience, as well as the side of the harmful spirits. The depicted parts of the interior would thus carry along their power to the exterior side. Another attempt to explain the frequency of the "drums on drums" theme in shamanic drawing may be made from a feature recurrent in Magar ritual practice, namely, the feature of reduplication. Whoever has observed shamanic ceremonies in this part of the Himalayas will be struck by</page><page sequence="12">Oppitz: Drawings on shamanic drums 73 the fact that many of the individual ritual actions that constitute a whole s?ance are repeated once or several times in it. In the course of a healing night, for instance, a core performance is the retrieval of the patient's lost soul. This act is performed several times in several ways in succession. After the shaman has concluded a long mythological chant that deals with the route that the fugitive soul of the patient has taken, he puts a butterfly into his client's mouth as visual proof that the lost soul has been found. A ritual journey in another chant sung in the same night?this time a journey into the underworld?ends with the shaman lifting the body of his client on his back, as a visible indication that he has brought back the ill person's soul from the underworld. In yet another theatrical rite of the same s?ance, the shaman performs a search for his client's soul under a mat spread out on a neighbor's roof; this search accompanied by dance and drumming is repeated nine times and in the end again an insect? representing the client's soul?is incorporated into him. This kind of reduplication can also happen on a larger scale. When a neophyte is being initiated into the shaman's profession, the whole process of his or her ritual birth is performed twice?once in the initiate's house and once in a public place on the following day. Some of the longer healing rituals are referred to collectively as d?orate, "double night"; correctly so, for the ritual events of the second night are in most parts repetitions of the ones in the first night. All these ceremonial reduplications are meant to consolidate the validity of the different ritual actions and to increase, if not to "double," their efficiency. The same intention is at play when a drum motif is drawn onto a drum. As a material piece of equipment, a shaman's drum is in itself the most important tool of his entire arsenal; it is the most powerful and versatile weapon in the shaman's struggle against the forces of destruction. And it is exactly these inherent qualities of the drum that are thought or hoped to be doubled by pictorial duplication on the surface of the instrument. Magar Types VI and VII: Ritual items on drums The drum's magic power and the question of how this power may be increased leads to the next category of Magar drum drawings: ritual items on drums, or one might also say "magical implements used in rituals drawn on drums." On a number of Magar shamanic drums one can find depictions of items that play a particular role elsewhere, in specific ritual performances. As drawn on drums such items may appear alone or in conjunction with other items. One such item in isolation can be seen in figure 19, Type VI. The abstract image reproduced in figure 19 is locally called thorb?r. This word is composed of two constituent parts: a verb, thorne, which means "to block," "to impede," "to obstruct;" and a noun, bar, which may be derived from the English bar; it refers concretely to a "rack," hung "from the ceiling above the firepit; it functions to shield the ceiling from sparks" (Watters and Buda 1981:16). As an implement used in certain rituals, a thorb?r is a magical barrier hung up over the door of a house to prevent particular spirits from entering. This magical barrier (fig. 20) is made of nine wooden planks alternating with nine thorny shrubs arranged like the steps of a ladder and held together by ropes. The planks of the thorb?r spirit barrier are decorated with nine banishing crosses each, which are drawn on the wood with coal. Among a multitude of potentially harmful spirits, there are only two for whom the preventative measure of hanging up a thorb?r barrier is prescribed: sar? zye?, the "spirit of white lime," and r?, the "killer of small children." Both are connected with untimely death, and both are former human beings who turned into evil spirits by suffering an accidental, untimely death. And only when a s?ance is held to ward off one of these two spirits is a thorb?r drawing (as in fig. 19) applied on the shaman's drum. Magical items depicted in conjunction are illustrated in figure 21, Type VII. (See also fig. 29). Two of these are zoomorphic, the others are not. The dominating figure of a fish in the center of the drumskin serves as a protective charm against tapeworms. Tapeworms are a frequent danger, especially for children?a good reason that the Magar try to combat them. But what, in their line of associations, is the connection between tapeworms and fish? Fish, it is said, often contain tapeworms, and every tapeworm that lives in a fish's body is not in a human body; thus fish, in a way, as substitute receptacles, prevent tapeworms from entering and harming humans. Tapeworms, it is thought, do not act out of their own accord; they are inflicted on other living beings by bad spirits. When they send tapeworms to a human being, the causing spirits often hesitate, remembering that any harm inflicted on a human body will sooner or later be fought by a powerful shaman. There is nothing to fear when tapeworms enter a fish. Showing a fish drawn on a drum or carved on a shaman's drumstick (fig. 22) to the causing agents of tapeworms may, it is hoped, influence their decision in favor of fish. Thus man may be saved from tapeworms. When images of fish are used as charms against tapeworms, they are referred to as jalgarwa, as "net and weir." This odd inversion of contents and container is</page><page sequence="13">74 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 ^? Figure 20. A thorb?r, or magic bar, as used in Magar shamanic rituals. Photo: Michael Oppitz. explained in the following way. Normally, fish are thought of as "contents" when they go into nets or weirs, their "containers." This situation is reversed when tapeworms go into fish: the fish become "containers," like nets and weirs, and the tapeworms become "contents," like fish in nets or weirs. To call charms in the shape of fish jalgarwa, or "net and weir," is, therefore, to allude to their expected effect: to ward off tapeworms from man by incorporating them into the bodies of fish, which will then be the tapeworms' containers, or "net and weir." This line of associations can be extended. In some of the Magar healing rituals, the shaman puts a client and his family under a fishing net as long as the presence of the spirit causing misfortune is considered dangerous. Here the real fishing net functions as a protection against spirit aggression from outside just as the fish, a metaphysical fishing net, keeps tapeworms from man. The second animal image in figure 21 is a snake. In order to explain its presence in a drum drawing, one has to refer once more to other ritual contexts in which snakes have a defined function. Every Magar shaman, as soon as he has completed the tests for his call with success, is given a necklace made of snake bones as an indispensable tool of his professional equipment. This snake bone necklace, called d?hrus, is endowed with magic power. When a shaman's client is struck by misfortune, the bones of the snake are said to twist or shake on their own accord. This seismographic sensibility of the snake bones toward unbalanced relations with the spirit world is exploited for diagnostic purposes. Thus a shaman may read off his client's body the degree and proximity of the dangers awaiting him from the vibrations that the snake bone necklace makes when held close to him. It is for this detective power to trace invisible dangers that snakes are drawn on drums. The graphic sign in figure 21 resembling a sand-watch is called a cakra by local experts. In Magar astrology this term is interchangeable with the term jantra, meaning "amulet" or "charm." A cakra is a charm with negative power. Drawn in geometrical patterns and sometimes enriched with additional words, letters, or numbers, a cakra is normally executed on bark with blood or poison and secretly planted in marshes, graveyards, crossroads, or rubbish heaps. From these depositories they are meant to emit the rays of their power, destroying witches and killing enemies. The appearance of a cakra on a shaman's drum signifies doom to his client's foes. Magar Types VIII to X: Sexual subjects on drums The last sign depicted in figure 21, a rhombus with a dot in its center, leads straight into the last category of drawings on drums, the one with blatant erotic motifs. The rhombic signs with or without a dot in their center, as depicted in figures 21, 23, and 24 (Types VII, VIII, and IX), or triangles with a dot in their center as in figure 25 (Type X), invariably stand for female human genitals? with or without indication of a clitoris (the dot).

Such plain erotic motifs appear on the drums of both male and female shamans indiscriminately. (See, for example, the drum held by a female shaman in figure 1.) One might be tempted to connect this frequency of sexual drum graffiti with the occasional association of shaman and drum with husband and wife. As attested by the ethnographic material on the Turkic Sor of Southwest Siberia, collected in 1926 by N. P. Dyrenkova,5 every prospective shaman of the tribe had to undergo a ceremony in which he married the drum intended for him. In this drum, according to Sor belief, was reincarnated the "celestial lady," patroness of the drum and wife of the mythical proto-shaman. Once the instrument had been completed, the initiate would visit its fabricator, who would be addressed as the drum's "father" and come forward with a formal proposal. The drum in this phase was called kis, or "girl," and the proposing neophyte, k?se, or "son-in-law," "bridegroom." The role of the drum's "mother" would be attributed to a man who had assisted in the making of the instrument. These "parents" would take a seat on a bench beside their bridal daughter, the drum, which was wrapped into a female scarf, and listen to the prospective shaman's wooing. Once the "father" of the drum had accepted wine, offered by one of the neophyte's clansmen, the suitor or one of his people would grab the drum, beat it, and run with it out of the house, feigning a marriage by capture. This would cause 5. See Sternberg 1935: 261, 263-264; Dyrenkova's notes, preserved in the Institute of Ethnography, Academy of Sciences, Leningrad (Archive F. 3. 1. 2. D. 61, B. 6-8), were later summarized by Alekseev 1987: 187f.</page><page sequence="15">76 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 a simulated dispute among the bridal drum's "parents" until they were calmed down again by a hard liquor, called arrack. After the engagement ritual was over, the new shaman, in the company of his newly betrothed drum, would undertake his first professional journey to ?lgen, the creator god and Lord of the empyrean sphere, which was also the maiden residence of the "celestial lady." Here he would be told how long his drum would last and how many other membranophones he would wear out in his lifetime. This transcendental journey with his newly betrothed drum was called "the wedding." Among the Siberian Yakut, the word for "shamanic drum," d?ng?r, was identical with the designation for "affined relatives" (Hamayon 1990: 774, n. 25). And, closer to the territory we are concerned with here, among the Chepang of the West Central Mah?bh?rat Range in Nepal, the drum, or ring, of the local magic healer, or pande, is generally referred to as "his wife" (Gurung 1985:139; Gurung 1987: 244). As a local interpreter told me, the Chepang make this association because the shaman and his drum take care about the well-being of their clients in the same way as a husband and his wife are worried about their offspring. This formulation suggests that in associating a shaman's drum with a wife and its owner with a husband, an affinity in substance is not necessarily intended. Among the Chepang the association seems to work rather like an analogy: one set of relations is expressed in terms of another in order to spark off some unexpected illumination about both. Yet, using the data on the Sor and a pioneering account by Sternberg (1925) as a starting point, Hamayon has suggested that there existed in Southern Siberia a widespread, even if undercurrent, concept, according to which shamans entertained a sexual or matrimonial tie of alliance with the supernaturals via the drum, the tool of communication par excellence with the extraterrestrial world (Hamayon 1990: 454^90). An indirect sexual tie between the spirit medium and his drum may also be detected in Magar shamanism. When the tree for a new shaman's drum is felled in the forest, the cutters take a "ride" on the trunk after stripping off its branches. And in certain healing s?ances the performing shaman may take his own drum between his legs and jump with it around the patient's house in a state of trance.6 Both these types of ride express first of all the fact that the shaman's drum, among the many other functions it may have, is a vehicle. But this act of "riding" is not devoid of erotic connotations. All this indicates that both in Siberia and in the Himalayas, a heterosexual air hovers over the shaman and his drum. A ceremonially confirmed marriage among the Sor, alluded to as a tie of affines among the Yakut, and treated metaphorically as matrimony among the Chepang, the relation between shaman and drum becomes an inferred sexual one among the Magar. But useful as these facts may be for a general frame of reference, the established erotic aura between shaman and drum does not yet explain why sexual subjects are drawn on the instrument. To find out, one has to turn in another direction, at least in the Magar context. The public exhibition of sexual organs, as may be observed on the drum drawings illustrated here under the rubric "sex on drums" (figs. 23, 24, 25?Types VIII, IX, and X, respectively), is also practiced in the plastic arts of the Magar. It is an old and now slowly vanishing craft to embellish the wooden bridges built in the traditional style in the valleys of the Uttar Ganga and its tributaries with large anthropomorphic sculptures. Locally referred to as ?ngye, or "figure," "image," and farther west in the regions of masta worship as dhauliya, or "guardian," these sculptures form the top ends of bridge piles. They stand in pairs on both banks of the river holding in line the long wooden planks across it. Some of these pile sculptures represent naked human couples. The male figure, more crudely worked than its female consort, holds a large erect penis in both hands. As can be seen in figure 26, these members sometimes become the prey of vandals. Where they have not been amputated, the wooden phalloi may be touched or rubbed by those who cross the bridge. The female image, as seen in figure 27, with large and low-positioned breasts, is busy too with both its hands to bare its vulva. The provocative exhibition of open vulvae and of massive male members in these sculptures serves a clearly defined purpose. Bridges are dangerous places. They may collapse or be washed away, or people may just plunge off them. Near them lurks death by accident, which is considered the work of a malignant spirit, sar? zye?, the "spirit of white lime." Bridges, therefore, would make a natural resort for this spirit and his associates, were there not these obscene images, for they have the power to drive evil spirits away.7 One of the explanations for this belief is that spirits with bad intentions hate to disclose their hiding place; 6. A good photograph of this drum-riding act is reproduced in Sales 1991:160,fig. 12. 7. The American novelist Peter Matthiessen's explanations for these sculptures, which he saw on his trip to Dolpo in 1973, are undoubtedly made up. He claims that the ?mages represent "local deities of the old religions" (which they don't, as they represent human beings); and that the ostentatious sexual postures of the female figures are like a</page><page sequence="16">Oppitz: Drawings on shamanic drums 77 Figure 26. Male figure exposing his sexual mem ber. Magar wooden sculpture on bridge pile near Kajarjung, Dhaulagiri Region, Nepal. Photo: Michael Oppitz. when they get near a bridge with sexual representations on its piles, they feel compelled to laugh out loud, thereby betraying their whereabouts, which in turn makes them flee from the spot. According to the second explanation, spirits are just terrified at seeing sexual organs or acts. This coincides with the Magar belief that harmful spirits neither conceive nor procreate. They have no genitals, from which it follows that they cannot have sexual intercourse. This insufficiency deters them with fright from anything connected with human sexuality. (In fact, a light shiver of fright even goes through a plain Figure 27. Female figure exposing her vulva. Magar wooden sculpture on bridge pile near Kajarjung, Dhaulagiri Region, Nepal. Photo: Michael Oppitz. villager when he happens to see a human couple in flagranti, for the life of this involuntary voyeur will be in danger for a full year afterward, unless he can pick up some dust and throw it in the couple's direction.) The two reasons given for the flight of a spirit from the sight of erotic images expose well the ambiguous reactions they are able to provoke: either amusement or terror. This ambiguity can be made out even with a superficial glance at the gesture of Baubo, the personified Vulva, registered in completely different times and cultures. According to Greek and Egyptian mythology, when Baubo bared her vulva and showed it to Demeter, who had been in distress, the latter cheered up. In a Japanese myth resembling the Baubo myth, the heroine exposes her vulva and instigates the gods to roaring laughter. The Sedang Moi used to bare their sexual parts "welcome to the mountain gods" (which they are not; rather than to invite humans to the gods, they are intended to dispel spirits from humans)?see Matthiessen 1978: 81. One wishes this author had restricted his fictions to his novels.</page><page sequence="17">78 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 before they would burn their forests in order to gain new fields; this gesture amused the spirits of fire and prevented an uncontrollable spread of the flames. Etruscan war chariots carried on their fronts depictions of Gorgo (the equivalent of Baubo) with spread legs and bared vulvae in order to frighten away the enemies. (All the above examples in Devereux 1981: 55-58.) It has been claimed that the ostentatious exposure of vulvae in stone sculptures named Sheila-na-gig and found over the entrance to ancient churches in England and Ireland were intended to rouse the sexual desire of young ladies who would pass under them (Murray 1934: 99). Yet it seems more probable from their location?at the entrance?that they were meant to keep the devil outside the house of God. In Japan the gesture of Baubo helped to guarantee human fertility, and an equivalent act, the presentation of cowrie shells (concha ven?rea) during the birth ritual, pursued the aim of driving away all spirits that were considered dangerous for mother and child (Singer 1940: 51). In ancient Rome amulets with cowrie shells, personified vulvae, or female figures in Baubo pose were carried to avert the evil eye; in modern Italy these have been replaced largely by amulets showing erect phalloi, male keys, or manos cornutos (Hauschild 1982: 99, 183-189). For whatever purposes pudenda may be exposed?to insult, to annoy, to disturb, to stimulate, to vex, or to bewitch?the dominating purposes in Magar assessment are either to amuse or to shock. And both converge in a single effect: they drive away unwanted spirits. It is for this intended effect and none other that drawings of sexual character are drawn on the shaman's drums. It may be added that in the theatrical performances of Magar shamanic rituals a specific role has been tailored for this effect. In all-night s?ances, as well as in initiation ceremonies, the acting shamans are accompanied by, in addition to the regular or manual helpers, a figure called l?t? kukur, or "Dumb Dog." This figure is recruited, like the other designated lay assistants, from the wife receiver's group of the client. The Dumb Dog is a kind of transcendental joker, constantly inclined to entertain the audience with crude, obscene side acts or other chaotic interludes. His main professional tool is a buffoonic weapon, a large wooden phallus with likewise wooden testicles, leaves for pubic hair, and a bell tied to its end. With this grotesque instrument, he gesticulates in the air or mimes the act of copulation (fig. 28).8 As much as this behavior may amuse the human spectators, it is also meant to catch the eye of the spirits?and chase them away. Thus one may conclude that these acts of the buffoon and the sexual drawings on shamanic drums, different as they may look in regard to their medium of expression, aim at the same thing, namely to divert people and to evict spirits. As may have become evident in the foregoing presentation, Magar drawings on shamanic drums are diverse. Their variety, constituted by either figurative or geometrical pictographic elements, can be classed into four distinct categories. The first of these categories deals 8. A figure of similar outfit and of similar functions as the Dumb Dog's may be recognized in the Altai rogue Koca Kan. He, too, is a buffoonic lay assistant of the shaman, who diverts and disperses the crowds with copulative mimicry using, too, a large wooden phallus with wooden testicles attached to its end; see Zelenin 1929: 87ff.; Lot Falck 1977: 81ff.</page><page sequence="18">Oppitz: Drawings on shamanic drums 79 HT*' *"l ? ' ;v / ;**" Figure 29. Two Magar shamanesses with drums. The drum drawing on the right depicts a fish and ritual items (Magar Type VIII). Photo: Michael Oppitz. with cosmological subjects. As the views on the universe in these drawings are always partial, they have been designated as semicosmological, in contrast to the fully cosmological ones found in Southern Siberia. In general, these latter drawings present a total view of a three layered cosmos in a cross-section profile, whereas the semicosmological depictions on Magar drums are concentric, with a frog's-eye view. Both Himalayan and Siberian drum drawings of the cosmological type share the feature of demarcating the cosmic spheres by zigzag lines that embody terrestrial mountain ranges. The Siberian examples, especially those of the Altaian regions, display a higher degree of refinement and are richer in decorative details than their Himalayan counterparts. The Magar drawings are not only poorer in decoration than the Siberian examples under consideration but are also less segmented. In fact, when they are not divided up at all, such as the examples of Types V, VI, and VIII, the Magar drawings tend toward figurative minimalization?single drum, single bar, single rhomb. This seems to support a shrewd and concise hypothesis proposed in 1961 by Lot-Falck in regard to drawings on Siberian drums, according to which an "absence of decor corresponds often to an absence of division" (Lot-Falck 1961: 37). The second category of drawings comprises drums drawn on the surface of drums. This again is a feature to be encountered in the North Asian domain of shamanism as well. But whereas the drum-drawn-on-drum theme is a marginal subject in North Asian shamanism, it is in terms of frequency the main motif in Magar drum drawing. Drum motifs dominate Magar drum drawings even if they do not occupy the entire screen of the membrane, which in most cases they actually do. In the Siberian samples, however, the drum motifs usually take on an ephemeral position within the entire picture, as items among other items. Rather than part of a narrative image telling a mythological story, as in some of the Siberian cases, the isolated and dominating drums sketched on Magar drumskins pound home monotonously their raison d'?tre: to double the power of the instrument by pictorial duplication. The third set of drum drawings assembles representations of objects used in shamanic rituals that are endowed with magic power. These consist of material objects, such as ban ladders or fishing nets, used to shield</page><page sequence="19">80 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 off evil spirits; of signs, such as the cakra charm, employed regularly by astrologers (Oppitz 1986: 29-36); or of animals that belong to the shaman's retinue (see fig. 29). The magical items drawn on the drums fulfill the same functions as the real objects that they depict. The fourth category is concerned with drawings of an erotic nature, in particular with the exhibition of genitalia. These are crudely crafted, and they never appear as part of a comprehensive human figure. The pornographic designs aim at contradictory responses: to amuse the humans and to shock the spirits. The four categories outlined above, "cosmological drawings on drums," "drums on drums," "ritual items on drums," and "sexual motifs on drums," are not tightly delineated; the passage from one to the next is often smooth. It may happen that a particular picture can be interpreted in two ways, as belonging to either of two of these categories. Thus a certain sketch of the cosmos may also be read as a drum. Or graphic signs of one category may be incorporated into the drawing of another. But, more important, there is a common purpose to all Magar drum drawings, even if their subject matter may differ and no matter to which category they may be attributed: they are all means of repulsion that act as deterrents of inimical spirits. And in this function the drawings can be associated with the shaman's paraphernalia in general. They become an additional dimension of his spirit averting armor. In fact, the drawings complete the magical healer's weapons of defense against the forces of destruction. Berlin, July-August 1990 BIBLIOGRAPHY Alekseev, N. A. 1987 Schamanismus der T?rken Sibiriens.
