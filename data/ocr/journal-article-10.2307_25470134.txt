DIAMOND THE PLAINNESS OF "SIGNS," "WONDERS," AND "MIRACLES" The DISEASE (or range of diseases) in Leviticus 13 and 14 that has come to be widely known as leprosy (tdara'at)1 confounded medieval Jewish exegetes because its various manifestations, as biblically described, did not correspond to any disease within human experience. Since its precise definition is superfluous for the purposes of this study, tdaraat will be referred to throughout by its common translation as "leprosy." In biblical texts, we find that buildings and fabrics, as well as human beings, could become symptomatic. Nahmanides considered leprosy in inanimate things "not in the natural order of things, nor does it ever happen in the world" and therefore concluded that these were "miraculous" phenomena rather than natural ones.2 Rabbi Samuel ben Meir (Rashbam, d. 1174), grandson of Rashi, extends this rubric over the entire range of diseases to the point that he admits he must abandon his project of peshat exegesis in favor of the midrashic when explicating this subject for "when we follow the plain meaning of Scripture or the expertise gained through the 1. As a result of a mistranslation of the Greek term lepra these skin diseases have been mistakenly identified with Hansen s disease. The biblical term tsara'at covers a wide range of skin diseases as well as discolorations in inanimate objects such as buildings, clothing, and furniture. Jacob Milgrom, for instance, renders the term more appropriately as "scale disease" in his Leviticus I?16 (New York, 1991), 768-889. 2. Ramban: Commentary on the Torah, vol. 3, trans. C. Chavel (New York, 1974), on Lev 13.47. He further corroborates this point textually, since its ap pearance in buildings is directly attributable to God in Lev 14.34, "and I inflict an eruptive plague in a house." Even Gersonides, who located these phenomena within the natural realm, was constrained to deal with the direct intervention of God indicated by this verse. See his prefatory comments to Lev 13.47 and his comments on 14.34. See Perus he ha-torah le-Rabenu Gerd horn ben Levi, vol. 3 (Jeru salem, 1997).

It is exclu sively endemic to the people of Israel "in order to ward them off of slan der" (lashon ha-ra).b The link between leprosy and this particular sin is consistently maintained in the Guide of the Perplexed (hereafter GP) where it is considered a "punishment for slander" and "a miracle that was per petuated in the religious community."6 His concluding remarks to the Lawd of Leprody Defilement constitute a relatively lengthy ethico-philosophi cal excursive break from positive law, wherein he tracks a series of in creasingly insidious crimes that spiral out of the offence of slander. Since what follows involves a close reading of this passage, I have included the full text of the passage Mishneh Torah (MT), Hilkhot turn'at tdaraat (Laws of Leprosy Defilement) (TT) 16.10 its entirety, here in English transla tion; with the full Hebrew text in an appendix at the end of this article: "Leprosy" is a comprehensive term covering sundry incompatible matters. Thus, whiteness in a man's skin is called leprosy; the falling off of some hair on the head or the chin is called leprosy; and a change of color in garments or houses is called leprosy. Now this change in garments and in houses, which Scripture in cludes under the general term leprosy, was no normal happening, but was a portent and a wonder among the Israelites to warn them against slanderous speaking. For if a man uttered slander the walls of his house would suffer a change; if he repented the house would again become clean. But if he continued in his wickedness until the house was torn down, leather objects in his house on which he sat or lay would suffer a change: if he repented they would again become clean.

But if he continued in his wickedness until they were burnt, his skin would suffer a change and he would become leprous and be set apart and exposed all alone until he should no more engage in the conversation of the wicked, which is raillery and slander. Now on this matter there is a warning in Scripture which says, Take heed in the plague of leprosy . . . remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way (Dt 24.9). That is to say, consider what befell Miriam the prophetess, who spoke against her brother, even though she was older than he and had nurtured him on her knees and put herself in jeopardy to save him from the sea. Now she did not speak spitefully of him but erred only in that she put him on a level with other prophets; nor was he resentful about all these things, for it is said, Now the man Moses was very meek (Nm 12.3). Nevertheless, she was forthwith pun ished with leprosy. How much more then does this apply to wicked and foolish people who are profane in speaking great and boastful things! Therefore, it is proper that he who would direct his way aright should keep himself far from their company and speak not with them, that he be not caught in the net of the wicked and their foolishness. Now the way of the company of the scornful and wicked is this: In the beginning they are profuse in vain words, as in the matter whereof it is said, A fool's voice cometh through a multitude of words (Eccl 5.2). Thence they go on to speak to the discredit of the righteous, as in the matter whereof it is said, Let the lying lips be dumb which speak arro gantly against the righteous (Ps 31.19). Thence they become accustomed to speak against the prophets and to discredit their words, as in the matter whereof it is said, But they mocked the messengers of God and desp'ioed his words and ocoffed at hio prophetd (2 Chr 36.16). Thence they go on to speak against God and to deny the very root of religion, as in the matter whereof it is said, And the children of Israel did impute things that were not right unto the Lord their God (2 Kgs 17.9); moreover it is said, They have set their mouth against heaven and their tongue walket h through the earth (Ps 73.9). What brought it to pass that they set their mouth against Heaven? Their tongue, which first walked through the earth. Such is the conversation of the wicked, occasioned by their idling at street corners, in the gatherings of the ignorant, and in the feastings of drunkards. But the conversation of the worthy ones in Israel is none other than words of Torah and wisdom; therefore the Holy one, blessed is he, aids them and bestows wisdom upon them, as it is said, And they that feared the Lord opake together every man to his neighbor, and the Lord</page><page sequence="4">98 JQR 96.1 (2006) hearkened and heard.

(Mai 3.17).7 Engaging in slanderous conversation sets the stage for far more severe offences of an intellectual and philosophical nature, all having to do with speech, which originates in conceptual confusion of an increasingly pro found nature. My aims in this study are first, and narrowly, to identify the precise nature of these offenses, to discern what Maimonides means by excluding leprosy from the natural order, and to determine in what way he rationalizes the "miraculous" causal connection between slander and leprosy. Second, and more broadly, the close reading to which I subject this non-halakhic passage in the MT offers further evidence in support of Isadore Twersky's thesis that there is an intrinsic symbiotic relationship between Maimonides' philosophical and juridical works. As Twersky has argued, Maimonides' code "reveals a vigorous intellectualis tic posture usually associated with the Guide, "and his image "as a philoso pher insisting upon the superiority of the theoretical life ... is, in fact, fully developed in the ore-Guide writings."8 According to Maimonides the range of symptoms and phenomena clas sified by scripture as leprody all share that diagnosis strictly in an equivocal sense (dhutafut)9oi the term. They "encompass many matters that are not comparable to each other,"10 which vary from skin discoloration to hair loss to changes in the appearance of inanimate objects like houses and clothing. As he states in his Mishnah commentary, "these [clothing, houses] are not natural and reason does not account for them at all for material and buildings are inanimate and changes that occur in them are not tdara'at except that the Torah called them such."11 The MT's solitary 7.

This is confirmed by the fact that what is determinative of a leprous state of ritual impurity is a priest's pronouncement and not a medical expert. See mNeg 3.1 and MT, TT 9.2. It is not a scientific/natural category but a legal/ theological one. For a thorough full-length study demonstrating that this concep tion extends to ritual impurity in general, see Menachem Kellner, "Maimonides on the Nature of Ritual Purity and Impurity," Da at 50 (2003): i-xxx. Kellner draws an instructive modern analogy between the Maimonidean/Halevian oppo sition and Durkheimian/Ottoian, where the former sees religious categories in terms of social needs while the latter views them as reflective of metaphysical realities (xxix). 12. In the discussion that follows, I am indebted to Isadore Twersky's incisive analysis of this passage in the MT though I disagree with his conclusion (in fact arriving at an opposite one) that "leprosy in clothing and homes absolutely transcends nature." See his "Halakha and Science: Perspectives on the Episte mology of Maimonides" (Hebrew), Shenaton ha-mishpat ha-'ivri 14?15 (1988?89): 147?49 (and its English version, "Aspects of Maimonides' Epistemology: Ha lakha and Science," Maimonides and the Sciences, ed. R. Cohen and H. Levine [Dordrecht, 2000], 227-43). 13. See, for example, his translation of the very first time it appears in the introduction to the GP, ed. Y. Ibn Shmuel (Jerusalem, 2000), 8. There are nu merous examples of terms which are classified as "equivocal" (sh-t-f) of which the following is only a sampling: face (GP 1.37); air (GP 1.40); soul (GP 1.41); eye (GP 1.44). See also Tibbon's definition o? shem meshutaf m his Perush ha-milot ha zarot in GP, ed. Y. Ibn Shmuel, 85?86. Maimonides' Treatide on Logic, trans. J. Kafih (Hebrew; Kiryat Ono, 1997), 168-72, lists six different meanings of the term medhutaf. See also David Baneth, "On the Philosophical Terminology of the Rambam," Tarbiz 6 (1935): 254-84. Herbert Davidson has recently concluded that the Treatise on Logic was in fact a work produced by a Muslim and not, as has long been thought, by Maimonides. See his "The Authenticity of Works Attributed to Maimonides," Meah Shearim: Studies in Medieval Jewish Spiritual Life in Memory of I. Twersky (Jerusalem, 2001). Even if this is the case, it is still most instructive to look at what the Hebrew translator, in this case Moses ibn Tibbon, considered sh-t-f to mean.</page><page sequence="6">100 JQR 96.1 (2006) His classification is strategically formulated to accommodate disparate audiences distinguished by lack or presence of a critical perspective. Al though oign and wonder can be understood as miraculous or supernatural, both can also refer to events within nature. The term pele (wonder) is often used by Maimonides in legal contexts simply to connote a rare, yet entirely conceivable, occurrence within the boundaries of the natural order. It is an exceptional circumstance, halakhically distinguished from those that "are likely to happen most of the time."14 Ot (sign) is also a term which can refer to both the miraculous and the natural. Though it serves to authenticate prophetic status, it need not consist of "a change in the order of the world" along the lines of a splitting of the sea. A simple prediction of future natural events qualifies as a "sign" as well.15 Both are considered by Maimonides to be a legitimate sign.16 At the very outset of his digression, Maimonides has crafted a classification of biblical leprosy to appeal to the widest possible range of religious sensibilities. The fur 14. MT, Rotdeah u-dhemirat ha-nefesh 6.12. For other instances of this meaning see Rotdeah u-dhemirat ha-nefesh 6.3; Mekhirah 19.5 (a rare circumstance which is not governed by the terms of a private contract since it is considered not to have been contemplated by the parties); 'Edut 16.4; Mamrim, 6.3 (an unusual name); Kidush ha-hodesh 5.2, 9.8. For the term as descriptive of the entire natural order, see Yesode ha-torah 2.2. For its use as descriptive of a scholar possessing extraordi nary legal acumen, see MT, San 4.8, 10. 15. MT, Yesode ha-torah 10.1 where the types of signs performed by Moses and Elisha are classified as dhinui minhago dhel 'olam (change in the nature of the world) and distinguished from "signs" which are mere predictions. For a list of miraculous "signs," see MT, Yesode ha-torah 8.1. Signs can also be the result of "sorcery" (Yesode ha-torah 8.2; 9.5), which, for Maimonides, can only mean a ma nipulation of nature which effects an illusion of the supernatural (MT, AZ 11.16). See also GP 3.37, pp. 540-43. Another type of sign (ot) that most likely also falls within the natural would be one performed by an established sage who is not technically a prophet. His sign is defined by the difficult expression "there is something in it" (devarim bago), that is, problematic or questionable. (For the talmudic use of this expression, see bKet Ilia; bKidd 44b). Even "miracles" like the splitting of the sea can all ultimately be considered "natural" in the sense that they were pre-programmed into nature at creation. See GP 2.29, pp. 345?46; PM, Avot 5.5; and Alvin Reines, "Maimonides' Concept of Miracles," HUCA 45 (1975): 243-85. Even the "spectacular" signs, then, like the splitting of the sea would end up as natural confirmations of a prophetic prediction, which "consists in God's making known to him the time when he must make his proclamation, and thereupon a certain thing is effected according to what was put into its nature when first it received its particular impress" (GP 2.29, pp. 345?46). 16. It is interesting to note that the very first appearance of the term 'ot in the Hebrew Bible (Gn 4.15, as the sign of Cain) is midrashically taken to indicate leprosy. See GenR 22.15.</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES ON LEPROSY-DIAMOND 101 ther qualification that these leprous outbreaks do not accord with "the normal way of the world" (minhago shel olam) can then be read as broadly as its antecedent terms to include not only the "miraculous" but the sim ply rare or unordinary.17 What all the various manifestations of leprosy share in common is the moral "virus" of slander that triggers them. They are distinguished by the escalating strength of their cautionary effects, which begin on Avails, spread to furniture, then to clothing, and finally to the physical person. Each manifestation is calibrated to signal danger and afford an opportu nity to avert further harm by a remorseful change in behavior. Unless an ethical awareness is achieved, the leprosy metastasizes from building to chattel to clothing to body in a pattern of increasing exposure and isola tion culminating in quarantine where the perpetrator is "segregated and identified all alone."18 After failing to "repent" (bazar) in response to the call of these graduated leprous omens,19 the gossipmonger is forced into a situation brought on by the ritual defilement of the disease (tum'ah)20 17. It is important to note that he does not describe this strange leprosy as a change (dhinui) in the natural order as he did with Mosaic "signs"; see above, n. 15. For phenomena which are not minhago dhel 'olam and yet still within nature, see MT, Hilkhot avodat kokhavim 2.1 (heavenly bodies, e.g., sun, moon, do not degrade like the minhago dhel 'olam); MT, Idure Bi'ah 21.9 (unnatural sexual inter course which is not reproductive); MT, Avel 13.11 (excessive grief and mourn ing). For these reasons my analysis here and thus far is in disagreement with that offered by I. Twersky, who argues that the combination of ot, and pele' that are not minhago dhel 'olam demonstrates that leprosy is indeed quite literally miracu lous and it can be legitimately considered as such "both from a philosophical and halakhic perspective," without any need to interpret it metaphorically "against the peshat" (Twersky, "Halakha and Science," 149). 18. Twersky, "Halakha and Science," 149. This picture of leprosy fits well with Susan Sontag's analysis of "diseases encumbered by the trappings of meta phor" and particularly how the leper was perceived in the Middle Ages as "a social text in which corruption was made visible; an exemplum, an emblem of decay." See Illness as Metaphor (New York, 1978), 5 and 58. 19. There is a similar perception in Islam, which views leprous symptoms as warnings prompting the leper to repent, although the socio-religious stigma attached to it was much harsher in the Jewish and Christian traditions because, according to Dois, there is nothing in the Quran that is comparable to the Leviti cal judgment of the leper. See Michael W. Dois, "The Leper in Islamic Society," Speculum 58.4 (1983): 902, 913. Such attitudes were not confined to Western cultures and can be found in cultures independent of the biblical tradition, such as the Chinese. See Olaf K. Skinsnes, "Leprosy in Society: 'Leprosy has appeared on the Face, " Leprosy Review 25 (1964): 35. 20. See Saul Brody, The Disease of the Soul: Leprosy in Medieval Literature (Ithaca, N. Y, 1974).

He becomes ostracized to the point where "he can no longer engage in the conversation of the wicked which consists of mockery and lashon ha-ra'."21 For Maimonides the philosophically offensive gravity of this "conversation's" content is far more substantial than its moral offensive ness. MIRIAM AND MAIMONIDES' SEVENTH PRINCIPLE OF FAITH22 Maimonides follows the rabbinic tradition that locates the source of the link between slander and leprosy in the biblical juxtaposition of the direc tives to be cognizant of the affliction of leprosy and the memorializing of what Miriam had endured "along the way when you exited Egypt,"23 which was taken to be a reference to Miriam's bout with leprosy in Nm mundud) translations of turn ah, there was an additional reason for Christian com mentators to link leprosy and sin, since these words "had no cultic sense, but did have distinct moral connotations" (113, n. 9). 21. The Code of Maimonides: Book Ten: The Book of Cleanliness, 203-04. This is clearly Maimonides' exegesis of Lev 13.46, which forces the leper to "dwell alone in a habitation outside the camp." The rabbinic tradition views this state alterna tively as either curative or punitive. Rashi, for example, cites both points of view when explicating the term "dwell alone" (badad) as: (a) "so that others who are ritually defiled do not dwell with him"; and (b) "since he caused separation by Lisbon ha-ra ' between man and wife and between fellow human beings so he be comes separated." Maimonides' rationale for the leper's isolation is consistent with the curative. Lashon ha-ra ' ceases because the leper can no longer keep the company of others guilty of the same crime. Although this remains merely a theo retical construct within Judaism, there were severe practical consequences of this moral opprobrium connected to leprosy in medieval Christendom. For example, the Lateran Council decree of 1179 under Pope Alexander III prohibited a leper from mixing in society, attending church, or being buried with others, thus im posing complete social ostracization. See P. Richards, The Medieval Leper and his Northern Heirs (Cambridge, 1977) and the chapter on "Separation," 48?61. 22. Terminological care must be taken whenever a reference to one of Mai monides' thirteen principles is made. The Arabic expressions used for "principle" are qa'ida and as I, which do not necessarily correspond to the Hebrew 'ikar. Therefore one cannot assume that the expression kofer ba- 'ikar means a technical denial of a principle. See Menachem Kellners discussion in his Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought (Oxford, 1986), 17-21. 23. Dt 24.8-9. For the rabbinic sources on this association, see Tanhuma (ed. S.

Miriam is singled out, according to Maimonides, for didactic pur poses: if Miriam suffered such grave repercussions for what appeared a minor brush with slander, then surely (kal va-ho mer) "the wicked and the fools" whose speech is unambiguously malicious will too. Miriam's relationship with her brother Moses belies the possibility of her truly slandering him for "she was older than him in years, had raised him on her knees and had endangered herself to save him from the sea."24 Her previous behavior presumes something less than offensive slander. Selfless conduct, which indicates a preference for Moses' life over even her own, would be incongruous with asserting herself at his expense. Further, she did not disparage Moses but rather "erred in considering him of a kind with other prophets." Finally, Moses, described as "exceed ingly humble,"25 could not have been insulted since he possessed no sense of self to be concerned about. In other words, there was no slur nor was there a victim who suffered the effects of the slur. Her "crime" then was more abstract and self-contained than an ethical insult of another. It con sisted of a confused conception of prophecy where the distinction be tween Mosaic and other degrees of prophecy was blurred. Given the position of the Guide, Moses' mode of apprehension is so unique that it falls outside the ambit of prophecy proper altogether. Moses exceeds the very highest degree of prophecy, as calibrated in the Guide,26 and occupies a separate category of his own. To identify Moses as a prophet, then, is to use the term in an "amphibolous" sense.27 Miriam's leprosy is a direct quent association with heresy in early patristic views to almost every vice imagin able in the Middle Ages. See Brody, Disease of the Soul, 124?46. 24. MT, TT 16.10. 25. Nm 12.3. In his commentary on mAvot 4.4, during a lengthy excursus on the virtues of extreme humility, for which Moses is the exemplar as indicated by this verse, Maimonides considers leprosy to be a punishment for haughtiness and arrogance. This would render Miriam's leprosy apropos to her assault on the very personification of humility. 26. There are eleven degrees of prophecy, the eleventh of which attests to the pinnacle of human intellectual perfection "provided one exempts Moses our Master." (GP 2.45, p. 402). Elsewhere Maimonides considers him to have actu ally achieved a separate intellect status ("angelic"). See his introduction to mAvot, chapter 7 of which is known as the Eight Chapters, in PM, Nezikin 393-96. See also MT, Yesode ha-torah 7.6. 27. GP 2.35, p. 367.

The former consist of metaphysical truths required for the integrity of a philosophical religion, the rejection of which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, while the latter form the dictates of popular religion, about which inadvertence and innocent mistake are not deci sively fatal.32 Within its biblical context, Miriam's case is a Maimonidean locus classicus for determining the factors by which Mosaic prophecy is distinguished from others. Mosaic clarity owes to the absence of any intermediary in facilitating the reception of the prophetic message, signi fied by divine speech that is "mouth to mouth" (Nm 12.8).33 Knowledge is not filtered through a parable or riddle but is conveyed "plainly and not by riddles and he sees the likeness of God" (Nm 12.8). He remains fully conscious and aware as opposed to the semi-conscious dream or 28. See also Rashi on Nm 12.1, which draw's the same a fortiori lesson from Miriam's inadvertence, though the substance of her "slander" concerned Moses's desertion of his wife rather than his prophetic capabilities. 29. The principles can be found in his commentary (PM) to mSan 10. 30. All the rights and privileges appurtenant to membership in the community of Israel are contingent on these beliefs; "he enters within Israel and we are obligated to love him, have compassion, and all those social obligations of love and friendship apply." 31. This is the loss of his "portion" (helek) to which Maimonides refers. For a definition of what man's "portion in the world to come" consists of, see MT, Teshuvah 8.1-3, which is essentially intellect contemplating the true essence of God. Punishment consists of man's disappearance into nothingness after death (8.5). . . . 32. "Could Maimonides Get into Rambam's Heaven?" Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 8.2 (1999): 240-42. 33.

It is known because the Torah endorses it. Miriam's action itself is what prompts the Torah s teaching on this issue and is not a position she could have arrived at by speculation alone. She therefore maintains her status as a bona fide mem ber of the Israelite community while, at the same time, poses an existen tial paradigm for all those in the future who might repudiate this or any other principle among the thirteen. Leprosy, and the quarantine it com mands as part of its treatment, is the external physical analogue to dis qualification from the "community" and loss of "portion" (world to come) warranted by rejection of a principle.35 Simply put, the body is itself a mashal and hidah (parable and riddle) to be read like a text. Once the term "leprosy" has been emptied of its fixed referents by identifying it as equivocal, then, as Paul Ricoeur has argued, textual hermeneutics be comes a model for interpreting even human actions and events. "Human action, too, is opened to anybody who can read."56 MIRIAM AND DIVINE ANGER The Miriam reference in the Mishneh Torah can only be fully appreciated by importing Maimonides' interpretation of Miriam's leprosy in the first section of the Guide. The citation of verses to demonstrate various nuances of biblical terms in the lexicographical sections of the Guide very often affords a glimpse of how Maimonides would want us to read the particu lar biblical context from which those verses have been extracted. One such example that is the concern of this essay is the term "going" (hali kha), the focus of chapter 1.24 , which cites the critical verse, Nm 12.9 (And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and he went away [ya-yelekh]), to illustrate the figurative senses of the term. When its sub ject is an incorporeal substance such as God, it assumes one of two mean ings, "either the spread of a thing or the withdrawal of providence. "37 In 34.

Miriam contracts leprosy both as a result of a "withdrawal of providence" from her person and divine anger, which "spreads" and extends to her body. In existential ist terms, Miriam has experienced both the stark absence of God and a brute and crushing presence.38 The language he uses is sensitive to popu lar conceptions and needs of varying intensity for a personal God who, in this case, singles Miriam out for divine recompense.39 However, in Maimonidean terms, God in fact has very little to do with Miriam's fate. The fundamental premise upon which Maimonides' entire theory of prov idence is built is that "providence is consequent upon intellect and attached to it."40 As a result, providence is graded proportionately to lev els of intellectual perfection ranging from supreme protection to utter abandonment to the forces of nature, to which those who do not realize their intellectual capacities "are given over to whatever may happen to befall them. For there is nothing to protect them against whatever may 38. One could imagine a contemporary Jewish philosopher such as Joseph B. Soloveitchik appropriating Maimonides' language here. 39. This is most evident in the way many of the medieval commentators on the GP understood the dual meaning attributed to going in the Miriam story. Typical is that of Isaac Abravanel, who sees the phrase went away of Nm 12.9 in the sense of spreading, as modifying God's anger "which extends until Miriam becomes leprous as snow as a result and afterwards providence left them and there fore va-yelekh bam has both senses together." For similar interpretations, see Shem Tov and Ephodi. Asher Crescas elaborates that the removal of providence implies "being cast to accidents" (meshulah la-mikrim) and does not connote "an inten tional evil from Him, however what happened to Miriam was intended by God as a punishment" ? as, he tells us, is often the case with the punishment of rebels in the Torah. For all these commentators, see Sefer moreh nevukhim im arbaah perushim (Jerusalem, 1960), 41a (henceforth MN). 40. GP 3.17. His position on providence is fully developed in GP 3.17?23. There is a large body of scholarly literature on the subject of providence in Mai monidean thought, among which I offer only a sampling: Yeshayahu Lebowitz, "Divine Providence in Maimonides" (Hebrew), Studies in Jewish Thought, ed.

Reines sums it up, "as a function of the human intel lect, the providence men receive is entirely a natural event," at p. 187.</page><page sequence="13">MAIMONIDES ON LEPROSY-DIAMOND 107 occur."41 The extreme implications of this providential theory inform the mechanics of Miriam's leprosy by virtue of Maimonides' identifies the term "going" with the withdrawal of providence, and it in turn with the biblical manifestation of that state known as the hiding of the face, of such passages as Dt 31.18. This verse appears again in GP 3.51 as a prooftext for the notion that man is abandoned to chance when he fails to tap into the intellectual overflow by way of exercising intellectual apprehension. Among those of the prophetic class such as Miriam, misfortune occurs when they are distracted from their contemplative focus on God, which automatically entails separation from him.42 What is crucial is that re sponsibility for the hiding of the face phenomenon of Dt 31.17-18 is laid squarely upon the shoulders of man. It is a euphemism for man removing himself from the divine providential purview, since the verses, according to Maimonides, make it "clear that we are the cauoe of this hiding of the face and we are the agents who produce thio separation."45 Therefore, the with drawal of providence signified by Nm 12.9 is a self-inflicted state of vul nerability to the dangers posed by the natural environment owing to Miriam's intellectual error or mental distraction. The second meaning of went away, which is "spread, diffusion and mani festation of a thing," modifies as its subject the term anger. Once this signification is drawn, the precise definition of anger when associated with God must be determined. Although all emotions are ontologically false descriptions of God, one of the most misleading as to the divine nature would be anger. It is one of only two traits for which Maimonides demands total banishment from the human psyche,44 and is explicitly ruled out in his legal code as a divine emotion (along with every other).45 In fact, considering Maimonides' approval of the rabbinic dictum equat ing anger with idolatry,46 if God were to vent anger, he himself would be guilty of idolatry. However, divine anger as a reaction to disobedience is also qualified as a necessary belief "for the sake of political welfare."47 It serves as a practical deterrent against social instability and so is pragmati cally essential but philosophically false.

That which invites God's anger exactly parallels that which repels his providence, "those who know him are those who are favored by him and permitted to come near him, whereas those who do not know him are objects of is wrath . . . For his favor and wrath, his nearness and remoteness, corre spond to the extent of a man's knowledge or ignorance."48 Just as intellect is the measure of providence, it can be said equally of anger that "anger is consequent upon the intellect," that is, the less perfect the intellect the more divine anger is attracted. Elsewhere Maimonides deepens his naturalistic account of divine anger by reducing it to an appraisal of natural calamitous phenomena rather than one that is in any way related to God's being. Man projects an emotion such as jealousy or anger, which humanly would induce catas trophe, onto God. Yet he is merely empathically describing how nature operates for "He is called fealouo and avenging and keeping anger and wrathful, meaning that actions similar to those that proceed from us from a certain aptitude of the soul . . . proceed from him . . . but they by no means proceed from him, may he be exalted, on account of a notion superadded to his essence."49 The anger, then, extended to Miriam is identical to the withdrawal of providence ? she becomes exposed to the natural vicissi tudes of life in the world represented, in this instance, by the contraction of disease resulting from some intellectual decay.50 The introduction of anger into the discussion of leprosy raises a vexing problem with the Maimonidean exegesis of the term noted by virtually all the major medieval commentators on the Guide. Elsewhere, Maimonides categorically states that expressions of divine anger throughout the entire 48. GP 1.54, pp.123?24. On the issue of anger I am indebted to the incisive analysis of Hannah Kasher in "Mitos ha-El ha-ko'es ba-Moreh Nevukhim," Eshel Beer Sheva 4 (1995): 95?111, which probes the precise meaning of God's anger as a necessary belief. Pertinent to my argument is her conclusion (105) that "the assertion God is angry with someone, does not describe a divine reaction but rather the epistemological state of that individual. Therefore, even though 'God' is the textual subject of the sentence, the conceptual subject is the individual who per sists in his ignorance." 49. GP 1.54, p. 126. 50. It is of interest to note that Maimonides' analysis of Moses' sin which prevented his entry into Canaan was that he demonstrated anger with the public, which led them to extrapolate that God was in fact angry with them at the waters of Meribah (chapter 4 of his Eight Chapters).</page><page sequence="15">MAIMONIDES ON LEPROSY-DIAMOND 109 Hebrew Bible are exclusively reserved for the crime of idolatry.51 How ever there are passages in which divine anger plays a role and yet idolatry is nowhere evident, notably among them the anger directed at Miriam and Aaron of Nm 12.9.52 The Miriam episode, I suggest, is a model for the resolution of this quandary when examined in light of an integrative hermeneutic between the Mishneh Torah and the Guide. The excursus at the end of the laws of leprous impurities does in fact consider slander against God as a final stage in a sequential evolution that commences with idle chatter and simple slander. That defamation of God consists of a denial ofa fundamental principle (kofer ba-'ikar). The precise nature of this divine defamation can be determined by the verse cited in illustration of it, "And the children of Israel did impute things that were not right unto the Lord" (2 Kgs 17.9). Predicating of God-qualifying attributes consti tutes, according to the Guide, a metaphysical slander (lashon ha-ra), a "loosening of the tongue with regard to God," the propagators of which are identified by the very same verse.53 Such "talk" strikes at the very 51. GP1.36, p. 82. 52. See Kasher, "Mitos ha-El ha-ko'es," 105-11, for a discussion of this prob lem. The following are a sampling of solutions offered by medieval commentators: (1) Ephodi: (a) Maimonides does not mean literally all places but merely a major ity; (b) any error as to the nature of God amounts to a form of idolatry. (This is the opinion cited in the name of Joseph ibn Kaspi.) (2) Shem Tov: (a) Instances of divine anger such as Nm 12.9 (Miriam) or Ex 4.14 (Moses) appear on the basis that even minor transgressions of the righteous are treated as severely as idolatry; (b) Maimonides means that nowhere other than idolatry will a combina tion of all three terms wrath, anger, and jealousy appear. (3) Abravanel: Maimon ides' assertion is confined only to those instances where these terms describe only God and does not apply to those which describe recipients of divine anger (e.g., Miriam, Moses). All these can be found in MN, 56 ab. 53. GP 1.59, pp. 141-42. See also MT, Me'ilah 8.8 and the use of the expres sion "imputing things that are not right against the Lord" within the context of understanding the rationale of commandments, and Isadore Twersky's discussion of it as a "central indictment of slovenly-sinful speech which spreads gradually like an uncontrollable malignancy," Introduction to the Code of Maimondes (New Haven, Conn., 1980), 407?09. It is noteworthy that Twersky understands this verse in Me'ilah as militating against specious rationalization of commandments and, when all good argument fails, advocating silence or admission of ignorance. This is consistent with "his general philosophic posture vis-?-vis perplexing prob lems or even antinomies: honest suspension of judgment ?silence ? resulting in traditional acceptance of a certain view is preferable to specious demonstration" (p. 410). Perhaps this explains why Maimonides draws attention to his inability to explain certain details of the purification rites biblically mandated for the leper while specifically rejecting the rabbinic traditions as inadequate for his purposes: "The reason why purification from it was effected by means of cedar wood, hyssop,</page><page sequence="16">110 JQR 96.1 (2006) heart of God's unity by corporealizing him and perceiving him as subject to affections. Since "attributes are deficiencies with regard to God,"54 ascribing them to God's essence is tantamount to a kind of hyper-idolatry that is "more blameworthy than a worshipper of idols . . . [and when you] believe that one of the states of the body belongs to him, you provoke his jealousy and anger . . . much more so than an idolater."55 For the narrow problem of Maimonides' unequivocal statement regarding the context of divine anger within the entire biblical corpus, Miriam's case is instructive. Her innocent yet imprudent assessment of her brother's prophetic status bears within it the seed of hyper-idolatry, so any outburst of divine anger, if not occasioned by conspicuous idolatry, must be examined for its im plicit presaging of it.56 In what follows I will chart the logic which dictates a straight line between Miriam and the heresy of kofer ba- 'ikar. MIRIAM ON PROVIDENCE Firstly, Miriam's error vis-?-vis Moses presents a physical paradigm for human error vis-?-vis God. By regarding Moses as of a kind with other prophets she failed to grasp his unique status. According to Maimonides, Mosaic prophecy is so singular that "the term prophet used with refer ence to Moses and to the others is amphibolous."57 His modes of appre hension and activity are so extraordinary "that we are incapable of grasping in its true reality."58 This reflects a parallel error commonly dcarlet thread and two birds is given in the midrashim; but it does not fit in with our purpose, and up to now I do not know the reason for any of these things" (GP 5.47, p. 597). A verse he chose as instrumental in reflecting the error of the leper also stands for exercising prudence when offering reasons for the commandments where silence is far preferable to sophistry. The most appropriate commandment in which to express this principle is that concerning the leper. 54. GP1.59, p. 143. 55. GP 1.36, p. 84. 56. Since some of the most prominent examples of divine anger are directed at people like Moses and Miriam, Maimonides tactfully omitted them from his list in GP 1.37, p. 82, while leaving it to his readers to form their own conclusions based upon statements elsewhere in his writings (e.g., GP 1.24), as I have done. This is simply to apply the method Maimonides himself recommended to "grasp the totality of what this Treatise contains" by "connecting] its chapters one with the other" and grasping every word "even if that word does not belong to the intention of the chapter" (GP, introduction, p. 15). 57. GP 2.55, p. 567. 58. GP 2.35, p. 369.

Second, and more important, to relegate Moses to a general prophetic class is to fail to appreciate the extreme state of proximity to God out of which he communicated with him, described by Maimonides at the end of the Guide. Moses had achieved a God-centered intellectual focus of such a concentrated magni tude that his worldly preoccupations were virtually disembodied from his noetic consciousness, "so that in his heart he is always in his presence while outwardly he is with people."59 What raises the stakes of Miriam's confusion regarding Moses is that his state of perfection is inextricably linked to Maimonides' theory of divine governance and individual provi dence. Stretching the furthest limits of the human mind, God, in response to Moses' plea of "Show me thy ways"(Ex 33.13), exposes all his goodneoo (33.19) to him, which translates into a global apprehension of all existing things ? "their nature and the way they are mutually connected so that he will know how he governs them in general and in detail."60 In addition, immediately after describing Moses' radical state of cerebral disembodi ment in 3.51, Maimonides launches into an extended discussion of the radical quality of providence secured by it. Consistent with the principle that duration and gravity of providence are functions of intellect, "provi dence always watches over an individual endowed with perfect apprehen sion, whose intellect never ceases from being occupied with God," to the point where he will "never be afflicted with evil of any kind. For he is with God and God is with him."61 Moses' uniqueness, then, lies in his being the supreme exemplar, both noetically and existentially, of the me chanics of divine providence in the human realm. Miriam's error strikes 59. GP 3.51, p. 623. 60. GP 1.54, p. 124. See Lawrence Kaplan, "I Sleep, But My Heart Waketh: Maimonides' Conception of Human Perfection," The Thought of Moses Maimonides, ed. I. Robinson, L. Kaplan, and J. Bauer (Lewiston, Me., 1990), 138-40, who argues, on the basis of GP 1.54 that out of this noetic experience arises Moses's imitatio dei par excellence in his capacity as a lawgiver, i.e., Moses formulates a perfect code of governance rooted in his understanding of God's governance. 61. GP 3.51, p. 625. What exactly Maimonides means by this perturbed many of his commentators and was the subject of a comprehensive treatment by Samuel ibn Tibbon in a letter addressed to Maimonides relating to inconsistencies be tween the general theory of providence in part 3 of the Guide and that of specific providence set out here in GP 1.51. See Zevi Disendruck, "Samuel and Moses ibn Tibbon on Maimonides' Theory of Providence," HUCA 11 (1936): 541?56.

Putting into doubt whether there is in fact such an ideal is to undermine the entire schema of providence including any lower stages than the Mosaic. Miriam's punishment of "withdrawal of providence" would then be most apt from a rabbinic "measure-for measure" perspective, since the quality of her providence conforms pre cisely to Maimonides' antithesis of the perfect man just described, the one whom God has abandoned and "becomes in consequence of this a target for every evil that may happen to befall him."62 Moses is the human apo gee of Maimonides' theory of providence and any mistake about where he is situated in the human hierarchy is also a mistake about the overall scheme of divine governance. What is crucial about Moses is that he is the human archetype of the mechanics of divine providence over human affairs. Questioning the archetype has the potential to undermine the en tire theory, leading to all sorts of misconceptions about the nature of God himself and his relationship with the world. DEGREES OF LASHON HA-RA': A FOOL'S VOICE Miriam's case is a stimulus which provides the links in the chain of verses, each signifying an escalating level of malfeasance from the simple frivolity and vacuity of bad company all the way to theological heresy. Each link reflects misconceptions of increasing severity regarding providence. The vanity of the prattle which takes place among an assembly of "scornful and wicked" (letdim; reoha'im) is contemplated by the verse "A fool's voice comes through a multitude of words" (E&lt;:cl 5.2).63 However, the offen siveness of such babble may not simply be confined to its inanity. The reason one must be sparing with speech is furnished by the preceding verse, Eccl 5.1, "For God is in Heaven and thou upon the earth, therefore let thy words be few." This latter verse culminates the chapter of the Guide in which 2 Fvgs 17.9 is cited ("impute things that were not right unto the Lord") as part of a tirade against those whose religiosity is mea sured by the number of attributes that can be predicated of God. For Maimonides, rather than indicating perfection, they imply deficiencies in 62. Raffel, "Providence as Consequent," 29-35. 63. That Maimonides' concern for avoiding unnecessary conversation was paramount can be seen from his comments on the saying in mAvot 1.17, "nothing is better for the body than silence," in which this verse appears as a primary prooftext and to which he dedicated one of his lengthiest treatments in the PM on Avot. The verse appears again in MT, Deot 2.4 to endorse the virtues of silence. For a full treatment of Maimonides' attitude toward speech, see R. Weiss, Mai monides'Ethics (Chicago, 1991), 51-58.</page><page sequence="19">MAIMONIDES ON LEPROSY-DIAMOND 113 God. The "few words," then, advised by the verse refer to restricting predications of God to the absolute bare minimum. The reason supplied, of "God in heaven and thou on earth," is the scriptural equivalent of the philosophical assertion "that the meaning of the qualificative attributions ascribed to him and the meaning of the attributions known to us have nothing in common in any respect or in any mode: these attributions have in common only the name and nothing else."64 The verse also appears as exhorting silence because God's presence is all-pervasive, yet it is a pervasiveness that is only pertinent to those who have, in effect, brought themselves into its precinct. In 3.52 of the Guide, God's presence and concern for man is predicated upon the intellect, the sine qua non of divine providence, "that overflows toward us and is the bond between us and him . . . Just as we apprehend him (God) by means of that light which he caused to overflow toward us ... so does he by means of this selfsame light examine us; and because of it, he, may he be exalted, is constantly with us. "65 Divine providence is a reflex of human intellectual perfection. Therefore, when Maimonides refers to those who conduct all their daily affairs with the utmost reverence because "we are always be fore him and walk about to and fro while his indwelling is with us,"66 he is contemplating only those of the intellectually perfected who warrant this kind of abiding accompaniment. Economy of speech is the hallmark of the reverential behavior manifested by these individuals, which, Mai monides points out, complies with the admonishment of Eccl 5.1 to "let thy words be few." The garrulous fools voice, then, of Eccl 5.2 is one that has no appreciation for the preconditioned metaphysics of the first cola of Eccl 5.1, for God is in heaven and thou upon the earth. Moreover, since the network of "scornful and wicked" typified by the fool's voice is the antith esis of the group envisaged by Eccl 5.1, it itself is the existential embodi ment of those who are excluded from God's presence and who are providentially abandoned. DEGREES OF LASHON HA-RA': LYING LIPS The next stage along the ignominious trail of lashon ha-ra ' is the slander of the "righteous" (tdadikim), anticipated by Ps 31.19: "Let the lying lips which speak arrogantly against the righteous become mute." Their con versation mirrors their existential state, which is devoid of divine concern. Their anthropocentric Weltanshauung impels them to project their own 64. GP 1.56, p. 131. 65. GP 3.52, p. 629. 66. Ibid.</page><page sequence="20">114 JQR 96.1 (2006) predicament onto the state of affairs they perceive to be that of the righ teous. Within its original biblical context the verse is a plea to God to vindicate his existence over the wicked. The silencing of the "lying lips" would be accomplished by an incontrovertible demonstration of justice that protects the righteous and punishes the wicked as petitioned in the previous verse, "let me not be shamed ... let the wicked be shamed, let them be silenced to the grave" (Ps 31.18).67 The content of the slander relates to the issue of providence since the often sorry physical circum stances of good men offers the most compelling evidence that the world lacks order. The conclusion drawn by the slanderers is that "he [God] is ignorant and that everything that is in this lowly world is hidden from him and he does not apprehend it."68 Since the wicked have no concept as to the manner of divine governance, they determine that the righteous, like themselves, are not the subject of divine attention. This conclusion logically follows from their root mistake that "all that exists, exists with a view to his individual sake; it is as if there were nothing that exists except him."69 This philosophical egotism is echoed in the self-centered arrogant behavior of unethical slander.70 One could say that they have confused the concept of the hiding of the face, which, as I have stated, is a conse quence of men's own actions cutting themselves off from providence,71 with a world that is hidden from him. DEGREES OF LASHON HA-RA': PROPHET MOCKERS The next targets of disparagement are prophets and their messages, whose vilification is underscored by 2 Chr 36.16, "But they mocked the angels of God, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets." Once we take note of the Guides identification of the term "angels of God" (ma Takhe elohim) in this verse with prophets,72 the prooftext once again indi cates the nature and gravity of this particular derision of prophets. The vision of Jacob's ladder is considered by Maimonides to be a parable about the prophetic process whereby the angels of God (again maTakhe 67. Both David Kimhi and Rashi see this as a call for the death of the wicked, i.e., the grave silences them. 68. GP 3.16, p. 462. 69. GP 3.12, p. 442. 70. See A.

The as cent, which consists of an ever-increasing knowledge of the stable and constant Being that resides at the summit, is succeeded by a descent that distills that knowledge into "governing and teaching the people of the earth."73 In its historical context the verse is referring to the flouting of prophetic advice, which consisted of an integrated blend of what moderns would deem political and religious, yet for the biblical mind would have been indistinguishable. For instance, verse 13 considers Zedekiah's rebel lion against the authority of Nebuchadnezzar, in direct contravention of Jeremiah's exhortations,74 perfidy against God. Catastrophic conse quences, including the destruction of the Temple and total loss of sover eignty, inevitably ensue (verses 17?21). The prophet as angel of God most likely connotes the process of tapping into the intellectual flow from the Active Intellect, itself considered an angel,75 thereby communicating angelic knowledge.76 An assault on the integrity of the prophet's counsel, then, is tantamount to severing the link between the ultimate source of that counsel and the prophet's communication of it. Once again the verse contemplates an offense which relates to the issue of providence since the prophet is the liaison between God's governance and human governance. 73. GP 1.15, p. 41. The parallel between the parable of the ladder and the Platonic parable of the cave is inescapable. Strauss already pointed out the corre spondence, but with Maimonides' hierarchy of light sketched out in the introduc tion to the GP. His analogy fits the ladder just as well: "Just as according to Plato the perfect state can only be realized through the philosopher who has ascended from the cave into the light, who has gazed upon the idea of the Good, so according to Maimonides and the Falasifa, the perfect state can only be real ized through the prophet for whom the night in which the human race gropes has been illuminated by lightning bolts from on high, by direct knowledge of the upper worlds." See Philosophy and Law, trans. F. Baumann, (Philadelphia, 1987), 105. 74. See, for instance, Jer 27-28; 2 Kgs 24.20. See also GP 2.40, pp. 383-85. According to Maimonides, Jeremiah's compulsion to "address a call to the peo ple" was so overpoweringly dictated by the strength of the intellectual overflow he tapped into that it overwhelmed his own personal urge to suppress his proph ecy to avoid "the contempt he met with at the hands of the disobedient and unbelieving people" (GP 2.37, p. 375). 75.

Maimonides' appropria tion of 2 Chr 36.16 elsewhere reinforces the notion, at this point, that heresy (kofer ba-'ikar) is the inescapable destination of this crime. It is cited as a prooftext that accentuates the gravity of maligning scholars (hakhamim; the rabbinic successors of the prophets) by attributing the destruction of Jerusalem to it.78 Maimonides then endorses the rabbinic definition of an arch-heretic (apikoros) as one who reviles scholars79 be cause they are the "teachers of his words." At this stage Maimonides has situated the leper on the cusp of the ultimate heresy. The conclusion of the verse cited from Chronicles depicts prophet scoffing as exhausting God's patience to the point where "the anger (hamat) of the Lord rose up against his people, till there was no remedy." The three verses cited thus far correlate to the series of junctures along the route traveled by the leprous scourge, previously plotted by Maimon ides, from building to body, as follows: Eccl 5.2 walls of house Ps 31.19 furniture 2 Chr 36.16 clothing Maimonides designated each of these stages as an ominous signal, afford ing an opportunity for repentance. Each opportunity that is squandered increasingly isolates the slanderer to the point of no return ? once its ap pearance in clothing is ignored, repentance is no longer available to block leprosy's path, which can now traverse to the body. Maimonides, in his Laws of Repentance, appropriates the end of 2 Chr 36.16, where there is "no remedy," to signify an irremediable state of moral deterioration from which there is no recovery even by way of repentance (teshuvah). "No remedy" means "they have sinned willingly and persist in their iniquity until they are necessarily deprived of repentance which is the remedy 77. Though I do not necessarily agree with all of Strauss's conclusions that view the prophet's primary role in his political leadership, I do accept it as one of the roles he assumes vis-?-vis the people.

God's anger, as discussed previously, portends a necessary belief which was essential to the naturalistic reading of Miriam's leprosy. For Maimonides, the failure to respond to calamity with penance itself reflects a bankrupt, mechanis tic view of a world governed by chance. The schema of the leper oblivious to the wake-up calls of the disease, as configured in the Miohneh Torah, correlates literatim to the Gu'ide'd theory of teohuvah: If you consider that the calamities with which I cause you to be stricken are to be borne as mere chance, I shall add for you unto this supposed chance its most grievous and cruel portion. This is the mean ing of the dictum: "[And if ye] walk with me in the way of chance (keri) then I will walk with you in the way of an angry (hamat) chance" (Lev 26.27?28). For their belief that this is chance contributes to neces sitating their persistence in their corrupt opinions and unrighteous ac tions, so that they do not turn away from them; thus it says: "Thou hast stricken them, but they were not affected." For this reason we have been commanded to invoke him and to turn rapidly toward him and call out to him in every misfortune.81 Again, anger accounts for the measured response to disregarding misfor tune as an invocation of tes h uvah.82 In other words, Maimonides has pre served the pragmatic biblical and rabbinic construct of leprosy as a deterrence from slander while maintaining, at the same time, his philo 80. Hilkhot Teshuvah 6.5. See also chap. 8 of Maimonides' introduction to his commentary (Eight Chapters) on mAvot in his PM. This is how Maimonides ratio nalizes such biblical phenomena as the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. See also Nahmanides' commentary on this troubling phenomenon (Ex 7.3),which would seem to undermine free will and responsibility (following in the same vein as Maimonides). 81. GP 5.56, pp. 539?40. For an attempt at synthesizing the need for petition ary prayer and the contemplative ideal which focuses on a changeless and static divine will as "complementary dimensions of a distinctive form of ethical-intellec tual worship" (another fine attempt at integrating the two enterprises of the GP and the MT), see Ehud Benor, "Petition and Contemplation in Maimonides' Con ception of Prayer," Religion 24 (1994): 59-66, and his full-length study of prayer in Maimonides, Worship of the Heart (Albany, N.Y, 1995). 82. It would appear, on the basis of GP 3.36, pp. 539-40, that the notion of repentance (teshuvah) itself is a necessary belief akin to anger. See Kasher, "Mitos ha-El ha-ko'es," 100, n. 13. Once again, for a different conclusion based on what Maimonides says about the efficacy of teshuvah in attracting divine providence in MT, Taaniyot 1.2?3, see Twersky, "Halakha and Science," 12, n. 151.</page><page sequence="24">118 JQR 96.1 (2006) sophical position that sees providence or lack thereof as conditional on intellect.

The second column consists of what those actions/reac tions translate into in the world of necessary beliefs.

All three verses cited in this grand finale, the first two of which represent this offensive speech and the closing its polar opposite, direct the reader once again to a critical chapter in the Guides discussion of providence which determines the precise content of this "speaking against God." 2 Kgs 17.9, "impute things that were not right unto the Lord," has already been cited as standing for those whose religious vo cabulary is replete with graphic, predicative God-talk.83 In GP 3.19, the "things that were not right unto the Lord" are taken to refer to a philo sophical position which denies God's knowledge of particulars and, spe cifically, of human contingent actions, on the empirical basis "that the circumstances of the human individuals do not take a course that is in 83. GP 1.59, p. 142.</page><page sequence="25">MAIMONIDES ON LEPROSY-DIAMOND 119 accordance with what, as every one of us considers, ought to happen."84 The Lawd of Leprody then locates the stimulus for subscribing to this warped theology in another verse, "They have set their mouth against Heaven and their tongue walketh through the earth" (Ps 73.9) ? "What caused them to set their mouths against Heaven? Their tongues, which walked first on the earth." First, this verse discovers the source of their error in the drawing of analogies between the physical world and God. Second, it acknowledges the graduated path which led to this point from speech between an assembly of fools, to defaming the righteous, to dispar aging the prophets, all products of "tongues which walked first on the earth." Third, it acts as a preface to the following verses in the Psalm, also cited in chapter 3.19, adducing the specific content of the critique of God's omniscience uttered by the "mouths against heaven." Ps 73.11-13 provides the proof for concluding that God lacks knowledge of worldly affairs in the success of the wicked, which, in turn, engenders a pessimis tic defeatism that "impels the excellent man to think that his inclination toward the good and the hardships due to the opposition of others that he endures because of it are useless."85 The concatenation of slander joined by delinquent views on providence logically culminates in its most abhorrent form, which qualifies as a "denial of a fundamental principle" since it literally violates the tenth of Maimonides' thirteen principles, "that God is aware of the deeds of men and that he does not ignore them." Maimonides concludes his philosophical homily at the end of the laws of leprosy with a verse that typifies speech that is the antithesis of the discourses of ignorance he has been tracking thus far: "Then those who fear the Lord have been talking to one another and God has heard it and listened to it and a scroll of remembrance has been written concerning those who fear God and value his name" (Mai 3.15). In GP 3.19, this verse is one of a block of verses from the final chapter of Malachi, com mencing with 3.13, which forms a response to those who consider the seemingly anarchic state of the world exemplified by the suffering of the righteous and the success of the wicked as evidence of God's lack of omniscience. This is the group that, by virtue of the intellectual caliber of their discourse, are "listened to" and "heard" by God. They attract the providence of the intellectual overflow with which they have communed. They grasp that "the notion of his providence is not the same as the notion of our providence; nor is the notion of his governance of the things 84. GP 3.19, pp. 479-80. 85. GP3.19, p. 477.</page><page sequence="26">120 JQR 96.1 (2006) created by him the same as the notion of our governance of that which we govern."86 It is primarily this negative conception of God which dis pels any "doubts regarding the deity and whether he does or does not know and whether he exercises providence or manifests neglect."87 Those who fear God qualify for that designation only if they have complied with the strict definition of the term afforded by the MT. "Fear" is a self perspective gained subsequent to an appreciation of the infinite wisdom reflected in the creation, which leads to a sober realization of the minus cule role one plays in it. This philosophical/psychological consciousness is the precise antidote to the self-centeredness that perceives a world ram pant with evil since everything is measured in terms of its own existence.88 They see a world devoid of governance, which is oblivious to moral con duct or philosophical pursuit. Conversely, Malachi continues, the "fear ers" will "come to see the difference between the righteous and the wicked" (3.18), since their measure of existence is not an egocentric one.89 Slander is an offense in which the ethical and the philosophical mirror each other. A moral arrogance that allows for the besmirching of another succumbs to an intellectual arrogance which deprives God of knowledge. It is no coincidence that the only two moral offenses and ethical traits that are considered by Maimonides to be on a par with kofer ba- 'ikar are haughtiness90 and laohon ha-ra' (slander),91 since they both exhibit the same metaphysical position. The prooftext substantiating the gravity of slander considers it to be an expression of self-aggrandizement that does 86. GP 3.23, p. 496. This with reference to Job, and the knowledge to which he becomes privy through his ordeal. Maimonides sees Job evolving from one who is merely morally virtuous but lacking wisdom to one who acquires wisdom (GP 3.22, p. 487). The theme of providence parallels this intellectual maturity in the narrative, i.e., Job moves from being excluded from providence to coming within its purview, since providence is consequent upon intellect. See L. S. Krav itz, "Maimonides and Job: An Inquiry as to the Method of the Moreh," HUCA 58 (1967): 149?58: "Of course! Lacking wisdom, Job lacked providence; virtues and uprightness could not protect him from accidents," 155. 87. GP 3.23, p. 497. 88. GP 3.12, p. 442. 89. Though this "revelation" of Mai 3.18 is a result of God's pity "as a man pities his own son," of 3.17 Maimonides is unequivocal that this does not imply any passion on behalf of God but is only an attribute of action "similar to that which proceeds from a father in respect of his child," GP 1.54, p. 125. One must therefore bear in mind that Malachi is not portending some divinely orchestrated revelation; rather, this is a metaphor for a natural cognition. 90. MY, De'ot 2.3. 91. MT,De'ot7.3.</page><page sequence="27">MAIMONIDES ON LEPROSY-DIAMOND 121 not acknowledge any superior authority to the self, "who said by our tongues we will overpower, with lips like ours, who is master over us" (Ps 12.5). The vacuum left by a perspective that sees no master who administers order and governance is filled by a narcissistic conceit that only acknowledges the self as master, often asserting its dominance at the expense of others. In fact, it is so pernicious that Maimonides considers it more heinous than the three cardinal sins in Jewish law ? idolatry, adultery, and murder.92 The simple ethical ramifications of slander were not sufficient for Maimonides to warrant the biblical/rabbinic trope tying it to leprosy. The digression from law at the conclusion of the laws of leprosy provides the requisite philosophical dimensions to slander so re pugnant as to demand a belief in a miraculous deterrence. When the reper cussions of what begins as idle chatter are understood to end in a denial of a fundamental principle of religion, only then does Maimonides' ap praisal, "the utility of this belief is manifest,"93 become a palpable one. 92. MT, Deot 7.5. Maimonides also cites the preceding verse in Ps 12.4, "May God cut off (yikaret) all smooth lips, every tongue that speaks brazenly" in MT, Deot 7.2. Considering Maimonides' definition of the punishment of "cutting off" (karet) as simply disappearing after death and being "destroyed like an animal" leaving no remnant of a soul, the choice of a verse with this consequence is most apropos. Since slander reflects a state of intellectual atrophy, the slanderer has not cultivated his human form, which is his intellect, which is his soul, which is the "thing that remains of man after death."
