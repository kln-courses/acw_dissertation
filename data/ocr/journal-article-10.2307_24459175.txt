<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD TARNAS THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE WESTERN MIND 1 The postmodern mind for obvious reasons has been confronting fun damental questions of epistemology with more than the usual sense of ur gency, and I believe that certain recent developments in the field of depth psychology have immense relevance for resolving some of these ques tions. I'll begin here with a brief overview of the background to our present intellectual situation, starting with a look at the Copernican rev olution, understood in its broadest sense. In a narrow sense, the Copernican revolution can be understood as simply a specific paradigm shift in modern astronomy and cosmology, ini tiated by Copernicus, established by Kepler and Galileo, and completed by Newton. Yet the Copernican revolution can also be understood in a much wider and more significant sense. For when Copernicus recognized that the Earth was not the absolute fixed center of the universe, and equally important, when he recognized that the movement of the heavens could be explained in terms of the movement of the observer, he estab lished what was perhaps the pivotal insight of the modern mind. The Co pernican shift of perspective can be seen as a fundamental metaphor for the entire modern world view: the massive deconstruction of the naive understanding, the critical recognition that the apparent condition of the objective world was unconsciously determined by the condition of the subject, the consequent liberation from the ancient and medieval cosmic womb, the radical displacement of the human being to a relative and pe ripheral position in a vast and impersonal universe', the ensuing disen chantment of the natural world. In this broadest sense—as an event which took place not only in astronomy and the sciences but in philosophy and religion and in the collective human psyche—the Copernican revolution can be seen as constituting the epochal shift of the modern age. It was a primordial event, world-destroying and world-constituting. Richard Tarnas lives in Big Sur, California, with his wife and two children. His book, The Passion of the Western Mind, an interpretation of Western intellectual and spir itual history, will be published by Crown!Harmony in 1990.

It has been said that Descartes and Kant were both inevitable in the development of the modern mind, and I believe this is correct. For it was Descartes who first fully grasped and articulated the experience of the emerging autonomous modern self as being fundamentally distinct and separate from an objective external world that it seeks to understand and master. After Copernicus, human kind was on its own in the universe, its cosmic place irrevocably relativ ized; Descartes "woke up in a Copernican universe," as John McDermott put it. Descartes drew out and expressed in philosophical terms the ex periential consequence of that new cosmological context, starting from a position of fundamental doubt vis-a-vis the world, and ending in the cog ito. In doing this, he set into motion a train of philosophical events leading from Locke to Berkeley and Hume and culminating in Kant— that eventually produced a great epistemological crisis. Descartes was in this sense the crucial midpoint between Copernicus and Kant, between the Copernican revolution in cosmology and the Copernican revolution in epistemology. For if the human mind was in some sense fundamentally distinct and different from the external world, and if the only reality that the human mind had direct access to was its own experience, then the world appre hended by the mind was ultimately only the mind's interpretation of the world. Human knowledge of external reality had to be forever incom mensurate with its goal, for ther% was no guarantee that the human mind could ever accurately mirror a world with which its connection was so in direct and mediated. Instead, everything that this mind could perceive and judge would be to some undefined extent determined by its own char acter, its own subjective structures. The mind could experience only phe nomena, not things-in-themselves; appearances, not an independent re ality. In the modern universe, the human mind was on its own. Thus Kant, building on his empiricist predecessors, drew out the epis temological consequences of the Cartesian cogito. Of course Kant himself set forth cognitive principles, subjective structures, that he thought were absolute—the a priori forms and categories—based upon the apparent certainties of Newtonian physics. As time passed, however, what endured from Kant was not the specifics of his solution but rather the profound problem he articulated. For Kant had drawn attention to the crucial fact that all human knowledge is interpretive. The human mind can claim no direct mirror-like knowledge of the objective world, for the object it ex periences has already been structured by the subject's own internal orga nization. The human being knows not the world-in-itself but rather the world-as-rendered-by-the-human-mind. Thus Descartes's ontological schism was both made more absolute and superseded by Kant's epistemo FALL1989 259</page><page sequence="3">logical schism. The gap between subject and object could not be certiRably bridged. From the Cartesian premise came the Kantian result. In the subsequent evolution of the modern mind each of these funda mental shifts, which I am associating here symbolically with the figures of Copernicus, Descartes, and Kant, has been sustained, elaborated, and pressed to its extreme. Thus Copernicus's radical displacement of the hu man being from the cosmic center was continued and reinforced by Dar win's relativization of the human being in the scheme of evolution—no longer divinely ordained, no longer absolute and secure, no longer the crown of creation, the favored child of the universe, but rather just one more ephemeral species. Placed in the vastly expanded cosmos of modern astronomy, the human being now spins adrift, once the noble center of the cosmos, now an insignificant denizen of a tiny planet revolving around an undistinguished star—you know the familiar litany—at the edge of one galaxy amongst billions, in an indifferent and ultimately hostile universe. So too was Descartes's schism between the personal and conscious hu man subject and the impersonal and unconscious material universe rat ified by subsequent scientific developments, from Newtonian physics all the way to contemporary big-bang cosmology, black holes, W and Ζ par ticles, and'grand unified superforce theories. The world revealed by mod ern science has been a world devoid of spiritual purpose, opaque, ruled by chance and necessity, without intrinsic meaning. The human soul has not felt at home in the modern cosmos—the soul can hold dear its poetry and its music, its private metaphysics and religion, but these find no cer tain foundation in the empirical universe. And so too with the third of this modern trinity of alienation: Kant's recognition of the human mind's subjective ordering of reality, and thus finally the relative and unrooted nature of human knowledge, was ex tended and reinforced by a host of subsequent developments, from Marx and Nietzsche and Weber to Heisenberg and Wittgenstein and Foucault, from anthropology, sociology of knowledge, and linguistics to cognitive psychology, literary criticism, and philosophy of science. The consensus is decisive: the world is in some essential sense a construct. Human knowl edge is radically interpretive. There are no perspective-independent facts. Every act of perception and cognition is mediated, contextual, theory-soaked. Human language is unrooted in an independent reality. Meaning is rendered by the mind and cannot be assumed to inhere in the object, in the world beyond the mind, for that world can never be con tacted without having already been saturated by the mind's own nature. That world cannot even be justifiably postulated. Radical uncertainty pre vails, for in the end what one knows and experiences is to an indetermi nate extent a projection. Thus, the cosmological estrangement of modern consciousness initi ated by Copernicus and the ontological estrangement initiated by Des cartes were in a sense completed by the epistemological estrangement ini 260 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="4">dated by Kant: a three-fold, mutually enforced, modern prison of alien ation. Now as an aside here I want to point out the striking resemblance be tween this state of affairs and the famous condition that Gregory Bateson described as the "double-bind": the impossibly problematic situation in which mutually contradictory demands eventually lead a person to be come schizophrenic. In Bateson's formulation, there were four basic pre mises necessary to constitute a double-bind situation between a child and a "schizophrenogenic" mother: 1) The child's relationship to the mother is one of vital dependency, thereby making it critical for the child to assess communications from the mother accurately. 2) The child receives con tradictory or incompatible information from the mother at different lev els, whereby for example her explicit verbal communication is fundamen tally denied by the "metacommunication," the nonverbal context in which the explicit message is conveyed (thus the mother who says to her child with hostile eyes and a rigid body "Darling, you know I love you so much"). The two sets of signals cannot be understood as coherent. 3) The child is not given any opportunity to ask questions of the mother that would clarify the communication or resolve the contradiction. And 4) the child cannot leave the field, i.e. the relationship. In such circumstances, Bateson found, the child is forced to distort his or her perception of the outer world and the inner feelings, with serious psychopathological con sequences. Now if we substitute in these four premises "world" for mother and "human being" for child we have the modern double bind in a nutshell: 1) The human being's relationship to the world is one of vital dependency, thereby making it critical for the human being to assess the nature of that world accurately. 2) The human mind receives contradictory or incom patible information about its situation with respect to the world, whereby its inner psychological and spiritual sense of things is incoherent with the scientific metacommunication. 3) Epistemologically the human mind can not achieve direct communication with the world. And 4) existentially the human being cannot leave the field. The differences between Bateson's double bind and the modern ex istential condition are more in degree than in kind: the modern condition is an extraordinarily encompassing and fundamental double bind, made less immediately conspicuous simply because it is so universal. We have the post-Copernican dilemma of being a peripheral and insignificant inhabitant of a vast cosmos, and the post-Cartesian dilemma of being a conscious purposeful and personal subject confronting an unconscious purposeless and impersonal universe, with these compounded by the post-Kantian dilemma of there being no possible means by which the hu man subject can know the universe in its essence. Thus we are evolved from, embedded in, and defined by a reality that is radically alien to our own, and moreover cannot ever be directly contacted in cognition. FALL 1989 261</page><page sequence="5">This double bind of piodern consciousness has been recognized in one form or another since at least Pascal: "I am terrified by the eternal silence of these infinite spaces." Our psychological and spiritual predispositions are absurdly at variance with the world revealed by our scientific method. We seem to receive two messages from our existential situation: on the one hand, strive, give oneself to the quest for meaning and spiritual ful fillment; but on the other hand, know that the universe, of whose sub stance we are derived, is entirely indifferent to that quest, soulless in char acter, and nullifying in its effects. We are at once aroused and crushed. For inexplicably, absurdly, the cosmos is inhuman, yet we are not. The situation is profoundly unintelligible. Now if we follow Bateson's diagnosis, it should not be surprising what kinds of response the modern psyche has made to this situation as it at tempts to escape the double bind's inherent contradictions. Either the in ner world or the outer world tends to be distorted: inner feelings are re pressed and denied, as in apathy and psychic numbing, or they are inflated in compensation, as in narcissism and egocentrism; or the outer world is slavishly submitted to as the only reality, or it is aggressively ob jectified and exploited. There is also the strategy of flight, through var ious kinds of escapism: compulsive economic consumption, absorption in the mass media, faddism, cults, ideologies, nationalistic fervor, alcohol and drug addiction. When avoidance mechanisms cannot be sustained, there is anxiety, paranoia, chronic hostility, a sense of helpless victimiza tion. And at the extreme there are the full-blown psychopathological re actions of the schizophrenic: self-destructive violence, delusional states, catatonia, automatism, mania, nihilism. The modern world knows each of these different reactions in various combinations and compromise for mations, and its social and political life is notoriously so determined. It's not for nothing that "Batman" is the most popular movie around. And is it any wonder that twentieth-century philosophy finds itself in the condition we now see? Of course modern philosophy has brought forth some courageous intellectual responses to the post-Copernican sit uation, but by and large the philosophy that has dominated our century and our universities resembles nothing so much as a severe obsessive compulsive sitting on his bed repeatedly tying and untying his shoes be cause he never quite gets it right—while in the meantime Socrates and He gel and Aquinas are already high up the mountain on their hike, breathing the bracing alpine air, seeing new and unexpected vistas. But there is one crucial way in which the modern situation is not iden tical to the psychiatric double bind, and this is the fact that the modern human being has not simply been a helpless child, but has actively en gaged the world and pursued a specific strategy and mode of activity—a Promethean project of freeing itself from and controlling nature. The modern mind has demanded a specific type of interpretation of the world: its scientific method has required explanations of phenomena that 262 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="6">are concretely predictive, and thus impersonal, mechanistic, structural. To fulfill their purposes, these explanations of the universe have been sys tematically "cleansed" of all spiritual and human qualities. Of course we cannot be certain that the world is in fact what these explanations suggest; we can only be certain that the world is to an indeterminate extent sus ceptible to this way of interpretation. Kant's insight is a sword that cuts two ways. Although on the one hand it appears to place the world beyond the grasp of the human mind, on the other hand it recognizes that the im personal and soulless world of modern scientific cognition is not neces sarily the whole story. Rather, that world is the only kind of story that for the past three centuries the Western mind has considered intellectually justifiable. As Ernest Gellner has said: "It was Kant's merit to see that this compulsion [for mechanistic impersonal explanations] is in us, not in things." And "it was Weber's to see that it is historically a specific kind of mind, not human mind as such, that is subject to this compulsion." Thus one crucial part of the modern double bind is not airtight. In the case of Bateson's schizophrenogenic mother and child, the mother more or less holds all the cards, for she unilaterally controls the communication. But the lesson of Kant is that the locus of the communication problem — i.e. the problem of human knowledge of the world —must first be viewed as centering in the human mind, not in the world as such. Thus it is the oretically possible that the human mind has more cards than it has been playing. The pivot of the modern predicament is epistemological, and it is here that I will be focusing this discussion. When Nietzsche in the nineteenth century said there are no facts, only interpretations, he was both summing up the legacy of eighteenth century critical philosophy and pointing toward the task and promise of twentieth-century depth psychology. That an unconscious part of the psyche exerts decisive influence over human perception, cognition, and behavior was an idea long developing in Western thought, but it was Freud who effectively brought it into the foreground of modern intel lectual concern. Freud played a fascinatingly multiple role in the un folding of the greater Copernican revolution. On the one hand, as he said in the famous passage at the end of one of his Introductory Lectures—I think it's the sixteenth—psychoanalysis represented the third wounding blow to man's naive self-love and megalomania, the first being Copernicus's heliocentric theory, and the second being Darwin's evolutionary theory. For psychoanalysis revealed that not only is the Earth not the center of the universe, and not only is man not the focus of creation, but even the human mind and ego, man's most precious sense of being a conscious rational self, is only a recent and precarious development out of the primordial id, and is by no means master of its FALL 1989 263</page><page sequence="7">own house. With his epochal insight into the unconscious determinants of human experience, Freud stood directly in the Copernican lineage of modern thought that progressively relativized the status of the human being. And again, like Copernicus and like Kant but on an altogether new level, Freud brought the fundamental recognition that the apparent reality of the objective world was being unconsciously determined by the condition of the subject. But Freud's insight too was a sword that cut both ways, and in a sig nificant sense Freud represented the crucial turning point in the modern trajectory. For the discovery of the unconscious collapsed the old bound aries of interpretation. As Descartes and the post-Cartesian British em piricists had noted, the primary datum in human experience is ultimately human experience itself—not the material world, and not sensory trans formations of that world; and with psychoanalysis was begun the system atic exploration of the seat of all human experience and cognition, the hu man psyche. From Descartes to Locke to Berkeley to Hume to Kant the progress of epistemology had depended on increasingly acute analyses of the role played by the human mind in the act of cognition. With this back ground, and with the further steps taken by Schopenhauer and Ni etzsche, the analytic task established by Freud was in a sense ineluctable. The modern psychological imperative, to recover the unconscious, pre cisely coincided with the modern epistemological imperative—to discover the root principles of mental organization. But while it was Freud who penetrated the veil, it was Jung who grasped the critical philosophical consequences of depth psychology's dis coveries. Partly this was because Jung was more epistemologically sophis ticated than Freud, having been steeped in Kant and critical philosophy from his youth (indeed even in the 1930s Jung was an informed reader of Karl Popper—which comes as a surprise to many Jungians). Partly this was also because Jung was by intellectual temperament less bound than Freud by nineteenth-century scientism. But above all, Jung had the more profound experience to draw upon, and could see the larger context of depth psychology's discoveries. As Joseph Campbell used to say, Freud was fishing while sitting on a whale—he didn't realize what he had before him. But of course who of us does, and we all depend on our successors to overleap our own limitations. Thus it was Jung who recognized that critical philosophy was, as he put it, "the mother of modern psychology." Kant had it right when he saw that human experience was not atomistic as Hume had thought but instead was permeated by a priori structures, yet Kant's formulation of those structures, reflecting his complete belief in Newtonian physics, was inev itably too narrow and simplistic. In a sense, just as Freud's understanding of the mind had been limited by his Darwinian presuppositions, so was Kant's understanding limited by his Newtonian presuppositions. Jung, under the impact of far more powerful and extensive experiences of the 264 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="8">human psyche, both his own and others, pushed the Kantian and Freud ian perspectives all the way until he reached a kind of holy grail of the inner quest: the discovery of the universal archetypes in all their power and rich complexity as the fundamental determining structures of human experience. Freud had discovered Oedipus and Id and Superego and Eros and Thanatos; he had recognized the instincts in essentially archetypal terms, but at crucial junctures his reductionist presuppositions drastically re stricted his vision. But with Jung, the full symbolic multivalence of the ar chetypes was recognized, and the personal unconscious of Freud, which comprised mqinly repressed contents resulting from biographical trau mas and the ego's antipathy to the instincts, opened into a vast archetyp ally patterned collective unconscious which was not so much the result of repression as it was the primordial foundation of the psyche itself. Thus depth psychology radically redefined the epistemological riddle that had first been posed by Kant—Freud doing so narrowly and inad vertently as it were, and then Jung doing so on a more comprehensive and self-aware level. Human experience was indeed conditioned by a multi tude of concrete biographical and historical factors, yet cutting across all these were universal patterns or modes of experience, archetypal forms which constantly arranged the elements of human experience into typical configurations and gave to collective human psychology a dynamic con tinuity. The archetypes endured as basic a priori symbolic forms while taking on the costume of the moment in each individual life and each cul tural era, permeating each experience, each cognition, and each world view. Yet what was the actual nature of these archetypes, what was this col lective unconscious, and how did any of this affect the modern scientific world view? Although the Jungian archetypal perspective greatly en riched and deepened the modern understanding of the psyche, in certain ways it too could be seen as merely reinforcing the Kantian epistemolog ical alienation. For as Jung repeatedly emphasized for many years in his loyally Kantian way, the discovery of the archetypes was the result of the empirical investigation of psychological phenomena and thus had no nec essary metaphysical implications. The study of the mind rendered knowl edge of the mind, not of the world beyond the mind. Archetypes so con ceived were psychological, hence in a certain way subjective; like Kant's a-priori forms and categories they structured human experience without giving the human mind any direct knowledge of reality beyond itself; they were inherited structures or dispositions which preceded human experi ence and determined its character, but they could not be said to transcend the human psyche. They were perhaps only the most fundamental of the many distorting lenses which distanced the human mind from genuine knowledge of the world. They were perhaps only the deepest patterns of human projection. FALL 1989 265</page><page sequence="9">But of course Jung's thought was extremely complex and in the course of his very long intellectually active life his conception of the archetypes went through a significant evolution. The conventional and still most widely known view of Jungian archetypes, just described, was based on Jung's middle-period writings when his thought was still largely governed by Cartesian-Kantian philosophical assumptions concerning the nature of the psyche and its separation from the external world. In his later work, however, and particularly in relation to his study of synchronicities, Jung began to move toward a conception of archetypes as autonomous patterns of meaning that structure and inhere in both psyche and matter, thereby in effect dissolving the modern subject-object dichotomy. Archetypes in this view were more mysterious than a-priori categories—more ambigu ous in their ontological status, less easily restricted to a specific dimension, more like the original Platonic and Neoplatonic conception of archetypes. This late-Jungian development has been pressed further, brilliantly and controversially, by James Hillman and the school of archetypal psychol ogy, which has developed what has been called a "postmodern" Jungian perspective: recognizing the primacy of psychic experience and the imag ination and the irreducible reality of the archetypes but, unlike the late Jung, largely avoiding metaphysical or theological statements in favor of a full embrace of psyche in all its endless and rich ambiguity. But for our present purposes the most epistemologically significant de velopment in the recent history of depth psychology, and I believe the most important advance in the field since F reud and Jung themselves, has been the work of Stanislav Grof, which has not only revolutionized psy chodynamic theory but has also brought forth radical implications for many other fields as well, including philosophy. Grof was a psychoanalytic psychiatrist, and the background of his ideas was Freudian, not Jungian; yet the unexpected upshot of his work was to ratify Jung's ideas on a new level, and also to bring them into coherent synthesis with Freud's. With Grof the Jungian archetypal perspective was reconnected with Freudian biological and biographical factors, though on a much deeper level than Freud had recognized. The basis of GroPs discoveries was his observation of several thousand psychoanalytic sessions, first in Prague and then in Maryland with the Na tional Institute of Mental Health, in which subjects used extremely potent psychoactive substances, particularly LSD, and then later a variety of pow erful non-drug therapeutic methods, which served as catalysts of uncon scious processes. Grof found that subjects involved in these sessions tended to undergo progressively deeper explorations of the unconscious, in the course of which there consistently emerged a pivotal sequence of experiences of great complexity and intensity. In the initial sessions, sub jects typically moved back through earlier and earlier biographical expe riences and traumas—the Oedipus complex, toilet training, nursing, early infantile experiences—which were generally intelligible in terms of 266 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="10">Freudian psychoanalytic principles, and appeared to represent some thing like laboratory evidence for the correctness of Freud's theories. But after reliving and integrating these, subjects regularly tended to move further back into an extremely intense engagement with the process of biological birth. Now although this process was experienced on a biological level in the most explicit and detailed manner, it was informed by—saturated by, one might say—a distinct archetypal sequence of considerable numinous power. Subjects constantly reported that experiences at this level pos sessed an intensity and universality that far surpassed what they had pre viously believed was the limit of individual human experience. These ex periences occurred in a highly variable order, and overlapped with each other in very complex ways, but abstracting from this complexity Grof found visible a distinct sequence—which moved from an initial condition of undifferentiated unity with the maternal womb, to an experience of sudden fall and separation from that primal organismic unity, to a highly charged life and death struggle with the birth canal, and culminated in an experience of complete annihilation; this in turn was followed almost immediately by an experience of sudden unexpected global liberation, which was typically experienced not only as physical birth but also as spir itual rebirth, with the two mysteriously intermixed. I should mention here that I lived for over ten years at Esalen Institute in Big Sur where I was program director, and as one can imagine in the course of those years virtually every imaginable form of therapy and per sonal transformation, great and small, came through Esalen. In terms of therapeutic effectiveness, Grof s was by far the most powerful—there was no comparison. Yet the price was dear—in a sense the price was absolute: the reliving of one's birth was experienced in a context of profound ex istential and spiritual crisis, with great physical agony, unbearable con striction and pressure, extreme narrowing of mental horizons, a sense of unspeakable alienation and the ultimate meaninglessness of life, a feeling of going irrevocably insane, and finally a shattering experiential encoun ter with death—with losing everything, physically, psychologically, intel lectually, spiritually. Yet after integrating this long sequence of experi ences, subjects regularly reported experiencing a dramatic expansion of horizons, a sense of sudden awakening, of being reconnected to the uni verse, all accompanied by a profound sense of psychological healing and spiritual liberation. Later in such sessions and in subsequent ones subjects reported having access to memories of prenatal intrauterine existence, which typically emerged in connection with archetypal experiences of Paradise, mystical union with Nature or with the divine or with the Great Mother Goddess, dissolution of the ego in ecstatic unity with the universe, absorption into the transcendent One, and other forms of mystical unitive experience. Freud called the intimations of this level of experience that he had observed the "oceanic feeling," though for Freud this referred FALL 1989 267</page><page sequence="11">only as far back as infant nursing experiences of unity with the mother at the breast—a less profound version of the primal undifferentiated con sciousness of the intrauterine condition. In terms of psychotherapy Grof found that the deepest source of psy chological symptoms and distress reached back far past childhood trau mas and biographical events to the experience of birth itself, intimately interwoven with the encounter with death. When successfully resolved, this experience tended to result in a dramatic disappearance of long standing psychopathological problems. I want to emphasize here that this "perinatal" ("surrounding birth") sequence of experiences typically took place on several levels at once, but it virtually always had a powerful so matic component. The physical catharsis involved in reliving the birth trauma was extremely powerful, and clearly suggested the reason for the relative ineffectiveness of most psychoanalytic forms of therapy, which have been based largely on verbal exchange and which by comparison seem scarcely to scratch the surface. The perinatal experiences which emerged in Grofs work were pre-verbal, cellular, elemental. They took place only when the ego's usual capacity for control had been overcome either through the use of a psychoactive substance or therapeutic tech nique or through the spontaneous force of the unconscious material. Yet these experiences were also profoundly archetypal in character. Indeed the experience of this perinatal sequence constantly brought home to subjects a sense that nature itself, including the human body, was the repository and vessel of the archetypal, that nature's processes were archetypal processes—an insight which both Freud and Jung had ap proached but from opposite directions. In a sense Grofs work gave a more explicit biological ground to the Jungian archetypes, while giving a more explicit archetypal ground to the Freudian instincts. The encoun ter with birth and death in this sequence seemed to represent a kind of transform station between dimensions, a pivot that linked the biological and the archetypal, the Freudian and the Jungian, the personal and the transpersonal, body and spirit. Now a host of implications from Grofs work could be discussed here— insights concerning the roots of male sexism in the fear of female birthing bodies; concerning the roots of the Oedipus complex in the far more pri mal and fundamental struggle against the constricting and punitive birth canal to regain union with the nourishing mother; concerning the ther apeutic importance of the encounter with death; concerning the roots of specific psychopathological conditions such as depression, phobias, obsessive-compulsive neurosis, sadomasochism, mania, suicide, various psychotic conditions. We could discuss the superbly clarifying synthesis Grof s work achieved in psychodynamic theory bringing together not only Freud and Jung but Reich, Rank, Adler, Ferenczi, Klein, Perls, Laing. But my subject here is philosophy, not psychotherapy, and while this perinatal area constituted the crucial threshold for psychotherapeutic 268 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="12">transformation, it also proved to be the pivotal area for major intellectual and philosophical issues. Thus I want to limit the discussion here to the specific consequences and implications that this work holds for our present epistemological situation. In this context, then, certain crucial generalizations from Grof s clinical evidence are relevant: First, the archetypal sequence that governed the perinatal phenomena from womb through birth canal to birth was experienced above all as a powerful dialectic—moving from an initial state of undifferentiated unity to a problematic state of constriction, conflict and contradiction, with an accompanying sense of separation, duality, and alienation; and finally moving through a stage of complete annihilation to an unexpected re demptive liberation that both overcame and fulfilled the intervening alienated state—restoring the initial unity but on a new level that pre served the achievement of the whole trajectory. Second, this archetypal dialectic was often experienced simultaneously on both an individual level and, often more powerfully, on a collective level, so that the movement from primordial unity through alienation to liberating resolution was experienced in terms of the evolution of an en tire culture, for example, or of humankind as a whole—the birth of homo sapiens out of nature no less than the birth of the individual child from the mother. Here personal and transpersonal were equally present, in extricably fused, so that ontogeny not only recapitulated phylogeny but in some sense opened out into it. And third, this archetypal dialectic was experienced or registered in several dimensions—physical, psychological, intellectual, spiritual—often more than one of these at a time, and sometimes all simultaneously in complex combination. As Grof emphasizes, the evidence suggests not that this perinatal sequence should be seen as reducible to the birth trauma; rather it appears that the biological process of birth is itself an expression of an underlying archetypal process which can manifest itself in many di mensions. Thus: . . . In physical terms the perinatal sequence was experienced as biolog ical gestation and birth, moving from the symbiotic union with the all encompassing nourishing womb, with a gradual growth of complexity and individuation within that matrix, through the contracting birth canal, to delivery. ... In psychological terms the experience was one of movement from an initial condition of undifferentiated pre-egoic consciousness to a state of increasing individuation and separation between self and world, in creasing existential alienation, and finally an experience of ego death fol lowed by psychological rebirth; this was often complexly associated with the biographical experience of moving from the womb of childhood through the labor of life and the contraction of aging to the encounter with death. FALL 1989 269</page><page sequence="13">. . . On the religious level, the experience took a wide variety of forms, but especially frequent was the Judaeo-Christian symbolic movement from the primordial Garden through the Fall, the exile into separation from divinity, into the world of suffering and mortality, followed by the redemptive crucifixion and resurrection, bringing the reunion of the di vine and the human. On an individual level, the experience of this per inatal sequence closely resembled, indeed it appeared to be essentially identical to, the death-rebirth initiation of the ancient mystery religions. . . . Finally, on the philosophical level the experience was comprehensi ble in Neoplatonic-Hegelian terms as a dialectical evolution from an ar chetypally structured primordial Unity, through an emanation into mat ter with increasing complexity, multiplicity, and individuation, through a state of absolute alienation—what Hegel called the death of God followed by a dramatic Aufhebung, a synthesis and reunification with self subsistent Being that both annihilates and fulfills the individual trajec tory. Now from the perspective engendered by these experiences, the fun damental sense of the subject/object dichotomy that has governed mod ern consciousness appears to be rooted in a specific archetypal condition associated with the unresolved trauma of human birth, in which an orig inal consciousness of undifferentiated organismic unity with the mother, a participation mystique with nature, has been outgrown, disrupted, and lost. Here, on both the individual and the collective level, can be seen the source of the profound dualism of the modern mind: between man and nature, between mind and matter, between self and other, between ex perience and reality—that pervading sense of a separate ego irrevocably divided from the encompassing world. Here is the painful separation from the timeless all-encompassing womb of nature, the development of human self-consciousness, the expulsion from the Garden, the disen chantment of the cosmos, the sense of total immersion in an impersonal material world. Here is the compulsive striving to liberate oneself from nature's power, to control and dominate the forces of nature, even to re venge oneself against nature. Here is the primal fear of losing control and dominance, rooted in the all-consuming awareness and fear of death— the inevitable accompaniment of the individual ego's emergence out of the collective matrix. But above all here is the profound sense of onto logical and epistemological separation between self and world. This fundamental sense of separation is then structured into the legit imated interpretive principles of the modern mind. It was no accident that the man who first systematically formulated the separate modern self, the rational ego, was also the man who first systematically formulated the mechanistic cosmos for the Copernican revolution. The basic a priori categories of modern science, with its assumption of an independent ex ternal world that must be investigated by an autonomous human reason, with its insistence on impersonal mechanistic explanation, its rejection of 270 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="14">spiritual qualities in the cosmos, its repudiation of any intrinsic meaning or purpose in nature, its demand for a univocal, literal interpretation of a world of hard facts—all of these ensure the construction of a disen chanted and alienating world view. As Hillman points out: "The evidence we gather in support of a hypothesis and the rhetoric we use to argue it are already part of the archetypal constellation we are in. . . . the 'objec tive' idea we find in the pattern of data is also the 'subjective' idea by means of which we see the data." In this view, the Cartesian-Kantian vision reflects the dominance in the modern mind of a specific archetypal gestalt, a specific stage in the arche typal birth process. In a sense the Cartesian-Kantian world view is the elaborate articulation of a particular archetypal domain, but it is that do main in which the archetypal resonance of reality has been selectively fil tered out: it is a specific state of consciousness in which the sense of the unitive spiritual depths of reality has been extinguished, leaving the world disenchanted and the human ego isolated. It is a kind of metaphysical and epistemological box, a reflection of the archetypal birth canal. The great irony here of course is that it is just when the modern mind believes it has most fully purified itself from any anthropomorphic pro jections, when it actively construes the world as unconscious, mechanistic, and impersonal, it is just then that the world is most completely a selective construct of the human mind. The human mind has abstracted from the whole all conscious intelligence and purpose and meaning, and claimed these exclusively for itself, and then projected onto the world a machine. As Rupert Sheldrake says, this is the ultimate anthropomorphic projec tion, a man-made machine, something not in fact ever found in nature. From this perspective it is the modern mind's own soullessness that has been projected from within onto the world. But in the depths of the psyche, archetypal forces and realities are ex perienced that reconnect the individual self with the world, that dissolve the dualistic world view. It would seem that it had to be depth psychology that brought forth awareness of these realities to the modern mind: if the realm of the archetypal could not be recognized in the philosophy and religion and science of the high culture, then it had to re-emerge from the underworld of the psyche. As L. L. Whyte has pointed out, the idea of the unconscious first appeared and played an increasing role in West ern intellectual history almost immediately from the time of Descartes, be ginning its slow ascent to Freud. And when in 1900 Freud introduced his work to the world in The Interpretation of Dreams, he began with that great epigraph from Virgil which said it all: "If I cannot bend the Gods above, then I will move the Infernal regions." The compensation was inevitable—if not above, then from below. Thus the Cartesian-Kantian condition begins as a Promethean move ment toward human freedom, toward autonomy from the encompassing matrix of nature, toward individuation from the collective, yet gradually FALL 1989 271</page><page sequence="15">and ineluctably it evolves into a Kafka/Beckett-like state of existential iso lation and absurdity—an intolerable double bind leading to a kind of de constructive frenzy. And again, the existential double-bind closely mir rors the infant's situation within the birthing mother: having been symbiotically united with the nourishing womb, growing and developing within that matrix, the beloved center of an all-comprehending support ive world, yet now alienated from that world, constricted by that womb, crushed, strangled, and expelled in a state of extreme confusion and anxiety—an inexplicably incoherent situation of profound traumatic in tensity. Yet full experience of this double-bind, of this dialectic between the primordial unity on the one hand and the contracting birth canal and subject-object dichotomy on the other, unexpectedly brings forth a third condition: a redemptive reunification of the individuated self with the universal matrix. Thus the child is born and embraced by the mother, the liberated hero ascends from the underworld to return home after his far flung odyssey. The individual and the universal are reconciled. The suf fering, alienation, and death are now comprehended as necessary for birth, for the creation of the self: Ο Felix Culpa. A situation that was fun damentally unintelligible is now recognized as a necessary element in a larger context of profound intelligibility. The dialectic is fulfilled, the alienation redeemed. The rupture from Being is healed. The world is re discovered in its primordial enchantment. The individual self has been forged and is now reunited with the ground of its being. All this suggests that another, more sophisticated and comprehensive epistemological perspective is called for. The Cartesian-Kantian episte mological position has been the dominant paradigm of the modern mind, but it has not been the only one. For at almost precisely the same time that the Enlightenment reached its intellectual climax in Kant, a radically dif ferent epistemological perspective began to emerge. First articulated by Goethe in his studies of nature, and developed on a broader philosophical scale by Hegel, this alternative perspective was most systematically formu lated within the past century by Rudolf Steiner. In essence, this latter perspective acknowledged the validity of Kant's critical insight, that all human knowledge of the world is in some sense determined by subjective principles; but instead of seeing these principles as ultimately belonging to the separate human subject, and thus not grounded in nature independent of human cognition, this new epistemo logical paradigm held that these subjective principles are in fact an ex pression of nature's own spirit, and that the human mind is ultimately the organ of nature's own process of self-revelation. In this view, the essential reality of the world is not separate, self-contained, and complete in itself, 272 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="16">so that the human mind can examine it "objectively" and register it from without. Rather the world's full reality emerges only with the active par ticipation of the human mind. Nature's truth is not something indepen dent and objective but is something that comes into being through the very act of human cognition. In this view nature permeates everything, and the human mind in all its fullness is itself an expression of nature's essential being. And it is only when the human mind actively brings forth from within itself the full powers of a disciplined imagination and saturates its empirical observa tion with archetypal insight that the deeper reality of the world emerges. A developed inner life is thus indispensable for cognition. The human imagination is itself part of the world's intrinsic truth; without it the world is incomplete. The scientist, Goethe said, can never arrive at nature's truth by detaching himself from nature and employing bloodless abstractions to understand it, registering the external world like a machine. Such a strategy guarantees that the observed reality will be a partial illusion, a pic ture whose depths have been eliminated by an unconscious filter. Rather, through an act of the sympathetic imagination the scientist must bring empirical observation and inner intuition into the most intimate interac tion. Then the archetypal form in each phenomenon is elicited: the uni versal is recognized in the particular and reunited with it. In this view the imaginai intuition is not a subjective distortion but is rather the human fulfillment of that reality's essential wholeness, which had been rent asun der by the dualistic perception. This participatory epistemology set forth by Goethe, Hegel, and Steiner is not a regression to naive participation mystique but is rather the dialectical synthesis of the long evolution from the primordial undiffer entiated consciousness through the dualistic alienation. The interpretive and constructive nature of human cognition is here fully acknowledged, but the intimate all-permeating relationship of nature to the human being and human mind is seen as overcoming the Kantian consequence of epis temological alienation. For the human spirit does not simply impose its order on nature, as Kant thought; rather the spirit of nature brings forth its own order through the human mind when that mind is employing its full complement of faculties—intellectual, volitional, emotional, sensory, imaginative. In such knowledge the human mind "lives into" the creative activity of nature. Then the world speaks its meaning through human consciousness. Then human language itself is recognized as rooted in a deeper reality, as reflecting the universe's unfolding meaning. Yes, knowledge of the world is structured by the human mind's subjective con tribution; but that contribution is teleologically called forth by the uni verse for its own self-revelation. Human thought does not and cannot mirror a ready-made objective truth in the world; rather the world's truth finds its existence when it comes to birth in the human mind. As the plant at a certain stage brings forth its blossom, so does the universe bring forth FALL 1989 273</page><page sequence="17">new stages of human knowledge. And, as Hegel emphasized, the evolu tion of human knowledge is the evolution of the world's self-revelation. Now of course all this suggests that the Cartesian-Kantian paradigm, and thus the epistemological prison of the modern mind, is not absolute. But if we take this participatory epistemology, and if we combine it with Grofs discovery of the perinatal sequence and its underlying archetypal dialectic, then a more surprising conclusion is suggested : namely, that the Cartesian-Kantian paradigm, and indeed the entire trajectory into alien ation taken by the modern mind, has not been simply an error, an unfor tunate human aberration, a mere manifestation of human blindness, but has rather reflected a much deeper archetypal process impelled by forces beyond the merely human. For in this view the powerful contraction of vision experienced by the modern mind has itself been an authentic ex pression of nature's unfolding, a process enacted through the growingly autonomous human intellect, and now reaching a highly critical stage of transfiguration. From this perspective, the dualistic epistemology derived from Kant and the Enlightenment is not simply the opposite of the par ticipatory epistemology derived from Goethe and Romanticism, but is rather an important subset of it, a necessary stage in the evolution of the human mind. And if this is true, several long-standing philosophical par adoxes may now be cleared up. I shall focus here on one especially significant area. Much of the most exciting work in contemporary epistemology has come from philosophy of science, above all from the work of Popper, Kuhn, and Feyerabend, who with considerable acuity have penetrated the foundations of scien tific thought. Yet despite this work, or rather because of this work, which has revealed in so many ways the relative and radically interpretive nature of scientific knowledge, philosophers of science have been left with two notoriously fundamental dilemmas—one left by Popper, the other by Kuhn and Feyerabend. With Karl Popper the problem of scientific knowledge left by Hume and Kant was brilliantly explicated. For Popper, as for the modern mind, man approaches the world as a stranger—but a stranger that has a thirst for explanation, and an ability to invent myths, stories, theories, and a willingness to test these. Sometimes, by luck and hard work and many mis takes, a myth is found to work; the theory saves the phenomena, it is a lucky guess. And this is the greatness of science, that, through an occa sionally fortunate combination of rigor and inventiveness, a purely hu man conception can be found to work in the empirical world, at least tem porarily. Yet a gnawing question remains for Popper: how in the end are successful conjectures, successful myths, possible? How does the human mind ever acquire genuine knowledge if it's just a matter of projected myths that are tested? Why do these myths ever work? How could the hu man mind, if it has no access to a priori certain truth, and if all observa tions are always already saturated by uncertified assumptions about the 274 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="18">world, how could this mind possibly conceive a genuinely successful the ory? Popper answered this question bv saying that, in the end, it is "luck"—but this answer has never satisfied. For why should the imagina tion of a stranger ever be able to conceive merely from within itself a myth that works so splendidly in the empirical world that whole civilizations can be built on it (as with Newton)? How can something come from nothing? I believe there is only one plausible answer to this riddle, and it is an answer suggested by the participatory epistemological framework out lined above: namely, that the bold conjectures and myths which the hu man mind produces in its quest for knowledge ultimately come from something far deeper than a purely human source: they come from na ture itself, from the universal unconscious which is bringing forth through the human mind and human imagination its own gradually un folding reality. In this view, the theory of a Copernicus, a Newton, or an Einstein is not simply due to the luck of a stranger; rather it reflects the human mind's radical kinship with the cosmos. It reflects the human mind's pivotal role as vehicle of the universe's unfolding meaning. In this view, neither the secular skeptic, like Hume, nor the perennial philoso pher is correct in their shared view that the modern scientific paradigm is ultimately without any cosmic foundation. For that paradigm is itself part of a larger evolutionary process. And so too we can now see a resolution to that fundamental problem left by Thomas Kuhn—the problem of explaining why in the history of science one paradigm is chosen over another if paradigms are ultimately incommensurable, if they cannot ever be rigorously compared. As Kuhn points out, each paradigm creates its own gestalt so comprehensive that scientists working within different paradigms seem to be living in differ ent worlds. Although to a given community of scientific interpreters one paradigm seems to be superior to another, there is no way of justifying that superiority if each paradigm governs and saturates its own data-base. Nor is there any common measure, such as problem-solving ability or the oretical coherence or resistance to falsification, that all scientists agree upon as a standard for comparison. A problem that is important for one group of scientists may not be important for another. What can explain the progress of scientific knowledge if, in the end, each paradigm is se lectively based on differing modes of interpretation and different sets of data and different scientific values? Kuhn has always answered this problem by saying that ultimately the decision lies with the ongoing scientific community, which provides the final basis of justification. Yet, as many scientists have complained, this an swer seems to undercut the very foundation of the scientific enterprise, leaving it to the mercy of sociological and personal factors that subjec tively distort the scientific judgment. And indeed, as Kuhn himself has demonstrated, scientists generally do not in practice fundamentally ques tion the governing paradigm or test it against other alternatives, for many FALL 1989 275</page><page sequence="19">reasons—pedagogical, socio-economic, cultural, psychological —most of these reasons unconscious. What then ultimately explains the progression of science from one paradigm to another? Does the evolution of scientific knowledge have anything to do with "truth," or is it a mere artifact of so ciology? And more radically, with Paul Feyerabend's dictum that "any thing goes" in the battle of paradigms: if anything goes, then why ulti mately does one thing go rather than another? Why is any scientific paradigmjudged superior? If anything goes, why does anything go at all? The answer here would seem to be that a paradigm emerges in the his tory of science, it is recognized as superior, as true and valid, precisely when that paradigm resonates with the current archetypal state of the evolving collective psyche. A paradigm appears to account for more data, and for more im portant data, it seems more relevant, more cogent, more attractive— fundamentally because it is archetypally appropriate to the culture or in dividual at that moment. And the dynamics of that archetypal development would seem to be essentially perinatal: Kuhn's description of the ongoing dialectic between normal science and major paradigm rev olutions precisely reflects the perinatal dynamics. The pursuit of knowl edge always takes place within a given paradigm, within a conceptual ma trix, a womb that provides a nourishing structure, that fosters growth and increasing complexity and sophistication; until gradually that structure is experienced as constricting, a limitation, a prison, producing a tension of irresolvable contradictions, until a crisis is reached; then some inspired Promethean genius comes along and is graced with an inner break through to a new vision that gives the scientific mind a new sense of being cognitively connected —reconnected—to the world: an intellectual revo lution occurs, and a new paradigm is born. Here we see why such geniuses regularly experience their intellectual breakthrough as a profound illu mination, a numinous revelation of the creative principle itself, as with Newton's exclamation to God, "I think thy thoughts after Thee!" For the human mind is following the numinous archetypal path that is unfolding from within it. And here we can see why the same paradigm—such as the Aristotelian or the Newtonian—is perceived as a liberation at one time and then a con striction, a prison, at another. For the birth of every new paradigm is also a conception in a new conceptual matrix, which begins the process of ges tation, growth, crisis, and revolution all over again. Each paradigm is a stage in an unfolding evolutionary sequence, and when that paradigm has served its purpose, then it loses its numinosity, it ceases to be libidinally charged, it becomes felt as oppressive, limiting, alienating, something to be overcome—while by contrast the new paradigm that is emerging is felt as a liberating birth into a new luminously intelligible universe. Thus for example the ancient symbolically resonant geocentric universe gradually loses its numinosity, becomes seen as a problem full of contradictions, and with Copernicus and Kepler that numinosity is fully transferred to the he 276 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="20">liocentric cosmos. And because the evolution of paradigm shifts is an ar chetypal process, this evolution takes place historically both from within and without, both "subjectively" and "objectively." As the inner gestalt changes in the cultural mind, then new empirical evidence just happens to appear, pertinent writings from the past suddenly are unearthed, new technologies become available, the telescope is invented and just happens to fall into Galileo's hands. As new psychological predispositions and metaphysical assumptions emerge from within the collective mind, within many individual minds simultaneously, then they are matched and en couraged by the synchronistic arrival of new data, new methodologies, new tools that fulfill the emerging archetypal gestalt. And if we apply Kuhn's insights to the larger intellectual context be yond science, to the entire cultural Weltanschauung, we can ask: why among all the alternatives has the scientific understanding itself been so privileged for the modern mind for so long? Because that understanding of the world and that specific modus operandi have fulfilled the cultural psyche's underlying predispositions on such a deep, archetypal level. In the same way the construction of a philosophical system, whether that of Plato, Aquinas, Kant, or Sartre—or Habermas or Quine or Derrida or Rorty—is not simply the result of logical reasoning from the observed data. Rather each philosophy, each metaphysical perspective and episte mology, reflects a global experiential gestalt that informs that philoso pher's vision, that governs his reasoning and his observations, and that ultimately affects the entire cultural and sociological context within which his vision is taking form. For the very possibility of a new world view's appearance rests on the underlying archetypal dynamic of the larger culture. Thus the Coperni can revolution that emerged during the Renaissance and Reformation perfectly reflected the archetypal moment of modern man's birth out of the ancient-medieval cosmic-ecclesiastical womb. And at the other end, the twentieth century's massive and radical breakdown of so many structures—cultural, philosophical, scientific, religious, artistic, political, moral, ecological, atomic—all this suggests the necessary deconstruction prior to a new birth. And why is there evident now such a widespread col lective impetus in the Western mind to articulate a holistic and participa tory world view, visible in virtually every field? The collective psyche seems to be in the grip of a powerful archetypal dynamic in which the long-alienated modern mind is breaking through, out of the contractions of its birth process, out of its mind-forg'd manacles, to rediscover its in timate relationship with nature and the larger cosmos. Thus we can see a multiplicity of these perinatal sequences, with each scientific revolution, each change of world view; yet perhaps we can also see one overall archetypal dialectic in the evolution of human conscious ness which subsumes all of these smaller sequences, one long meta trajectory, beginning with the primordial participation mystique and, in a FALL 1989 277</page><page sequence="21">sense, culminating before our eyes. Now there are a number of further dimensions to this dialectic in the evolution of consciousness that I would have liked to discuss, and indeed should discuss, in order to make this a fully cogent presentation. Above all I would wish to analyze in detail the great epistemological journey of the Western mind from the pre-Socratics and the birth of philosophy out of the mythological consciousness in an cient Greece, through the classical, medieval, and modern eras to our own postmodern age, examining the evolution of language, the changing re lationship of universal and particular, the separation of concept and per cept, the gradual withdrawal of the archetypal in favor of the concrete and individual, the constant movement from idealistic realism to nomi nalism, the constant thrust toward immanence, the gradual "descent of the logos" in so many senses, the gradual empowerment of the autono mous human intellect, the absolutely pivotal role of medieval Scholasti cism . . . but this would be another lecture altogether. Instead what I would like to conclude with here is a brief and more general overview of this long evolution, applying now on a large scale the insights and per spectives that have been set forth in the foregoing discussion. Many generalizations could be made about the history of the Western mind, but today perhaps the most immediately obvious is that it has been from start to finish an overwhelmingly masculine phenomenon: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Paul, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Copernicus, Galileo, Bacon, Descartes, Newton, Locke, Hume, Kant, Darwin, Marx, Ni etzsche, Freud. . . . The Western intellectual tradition has been produced and canonized almost entirely by men, and informed mainly by male per spectives. Now this masculine dominance in Western intellectual history has certainly not occurred because women are any less intelligent than men. But can it be attributed solely to social restriction? I think not. I be lieve something more profound is going on here: something archetypal. In all the major languages within which the Western tradition has developed —from Greek and Latin to French, German, and English —the word most often employed to indicate the collective human entity has been masculine in gender (anthropos, homo, homme, Mensch, man). Thus it's always been "man" this and "man" that—"the ascent of man," "man's place in the cosmos," "man's struggle with nature,""the great achievement of modern man," and so forth. The "man" of the Western tradition has been a questing masculine hero, a Promethean metaphysical and biological rebel who constantly seeks freedom and progress for him self, and who thus constantly strives to differentiate himself from and control the matrix out of which he emerged. This masculine predisposi tion in the evolution of the Western mind, though largely unconscious, has been not only characteristic of that evolution, it has been essential to it. 278 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="22">For the evolution of the Western mind has been driven by a heroic im pulse to forge an autonomous rational human self by separating it from the primordial unity with nature. The fundamental religious, scientific, and philosophical perspectives of Western culture have all been affected by this decisive masculinity—visible in the West's patriarchal religion from Judaism, its rationalist philosophy from Greece, its objectivist sci ence from modern Europe. All of these have served the cause of evolving the autonomous human will and intellect, the independent individual ego, the human being in its uniqueness, separateness, and freedom. But to do this the masculine mind has repressed the feminine. Whether one sees this in the Judaeo-Christian denial of the Great Mother Goddess or in the Enlightenment's exalting of the coolly self-aware rational ego sep arate from a disenchanted external nature, the evolution of the Western mind has been founded on the repression of the feminine—on the repres sion of undifferentiated unitary consciousness, of the participation mystique with nature, of any recognition of the soul of the world, of the anima mundi—a denial of ecological connectedness, a denial of the non-rational, of mystery and ambiguity, of imagination, emotion, instinct, body, na ture, woman. But this separation necessarily calls forth a longing for a reunion with that which has been lost—especially after the masculine heroic quest has been pressed to its utmost one-sided extreme in the consciousness of the late modern mind, which in its absolute isolation has appropriated to itself all conscious intelligence in the universe (man alone is a conscious intel ligent being, the cosmos is blind and mechanistic, God is dead). Then man faces the existential crisis of being a solitary and mortal conscious ego thrown into an ultimately meaningless and unknowable universe. And he faces the psychological and biological crisis of living in a world that has come to be shaped in such a way that it precisely matches his world view— i.e. in an environment that is increasingly mechanistic, atomized, soulless, and self-destructive. The crisis of modern man is an essentially masculine crisis, and I believe its resolution is already now occurring in the tremendous emergence of the feminine in our culture—visible not only in the rise of feminism and the growing empowerment of women, and in the wide spread opening up to feminine values by both men and women, but also in the increasing sense of unity with the planet and all forms of nature on it, in the increasing awareness of the ecological, in the increasing em brace of the human community, in the growing interest in feminine per spectives of the divine, in the rise of sophianic Judaeo-Christian theology as well as neo-pagan Mother Goddess worship, in the new concern with the mystery of childbirth and the dignity of the maternal, in the broad popularity of the Gaia hypothesis, in the growing sympathy for non Western and pre-modern cultures, in the widespread Western appreci ation of Eastern mysticism and spiritual practice, in the widespread in volvement with esoteric disciplines, in the new interest in the mythological FALL 1989 279</page><page sequence="23">perspective, in archetypal psychology, in henneneutics, in non-objectivist epistemologies, in mystical interpretations of modern physics, in theories of the participatory universe, in the ideas of Bohm, Bateson, Jantsch, Wheeler, Prigogine, Young, Sheldrake, Capra—the list could go on and on. As Jung prophesied, a great shift is taking place in the contemporary psyche, a reconciliation between the two great polarities, a union of opposites—a hieros gamos (sacred marriage) between the long-dominant but now alienated masculine and the long-suppressed but now ascending feminine. And this dramatic development is not just a compensation, not just a return of the repressed, for I believe this has all along been the underlying goal of Western intellectual and spiritual evolution. The deepest passion of the Western mind has been to reunite with the ground of its being. Its driving im pulse has been the quest of the West's masculine consciousness to come to terms with the great feminine principle in life —to differentiate itself from but then rediscover and reunite with the feminine—with the mys tery of life, of nature, of soul. And that reunion can now occur on a new and different level from that of the primitive unconscious unity, for the long evolution of human consciousness has prepared it to be capable at last of embracing the ground of its own being freely and consciously. The telos, the inner direction and goal, of the Western mind has been to re connect with the cosmos in a mature participation mystique, to surrender it self freely in the embrace of a larger unity that preserves human auton omy while also transcending human alienation. But to achieve this reintegraion of the repressed feminine, the mascu line must undergo a sacrifice, an ego death. The Western mind must be willing to open itself to a reality the nature of which could shatter its most established beliefs about itself and about the world. This is where the real heroism is going to be. And this is the great challenge of our time, the ev olutionary demand for the masculine to overcome its hubris and one sidedness, to own its unconscious shadow, to enter into a fundamentally new relationship of mutuality with the feminine in all its forms. The fem inine then becomes not the objectified "other," but rather source, goal, and immanent presence; not that which must be controlled, denied, and exploited, but rather fully acknowledged, recognized, and responded to for itself. Thus I believe that the West's incessantly innovative masculine order ing of reality has been gradually leading, in an immensely long dialectical movement, toward a reconciliation with the lost feminine unity, toward a profound and many-leveled marriage of the masculine and feminine, a triumphant and healing reunion; and that much of the conflict and con fusion of our own era reflects the fact that this evolutionary drama is now reaching its climactic stages. I therefore would affirm the ideals put forth by the supporters of feminist, ecological, and other countercultural (concluded on page 299) 280 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="24">TARNAS (continued from page 280) perspectives, but I would also wish to affirm those who have valued and upheld the central Western tradition, for I believe that this tradition, from Socrates and Augustine to Descartes and Freud and beyond, should be seen as a necessary and noble part of a great dialectic, and not just re jected as an imperialist-chauvinist plot. Each perspective, masculine and feminine, is here both affirmed and yet also transcended, recognized as part of a larger whole; for each polarity requires the other for its fulfill ment. And their synthesis leads to something fundamentally new: it brings an unexpected opening to a larger reality which cannot be grasped before it arrives, because this new reality is itself a creative act. But why has the pervasive masculinity of the Western intellectual and spiritual tradition suddenly become so apparent to us today, while it re mained so invisible to almost every previous generation? I believe this is so because, as Hegel suggested, a civilization cannot become conscious of itself, cannot recognize its own significance, until it is so mature that it is approaching its own death. Today we are experiencing something that looks very much like the death of modern man, indeed that looks very much like the death of West ern man. Perhaps the end of "man" himself is at hand. But man is not a goal; man is something that must be overcome—and fulfilled, in the em brace of the feminine. FALL 1989 299</page></plain_text>
