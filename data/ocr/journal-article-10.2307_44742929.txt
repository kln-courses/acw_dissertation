Patel I.R.B.A., Raymond Poincare Hospital Garches, France J. Hureau University Rene Descartes Paris, France ABSTRACT The data presented in this paper were yielded by tests performed on unembalmed human cadavers fitted with three-point seat belts and subjected to frontal collisions. The purpose is to define one or more functions predictive of thoracic injuries to cadavers whose rib "resis- tance" is known (i.e. BCF parameter (1)*). These functions predict the number of rib fractures and the thoracic AIS in terms of : - anthropometrical data on the cadavers, - data representative of the thoracic resistance of the cadavers and physical parameters arising from the deceleration pulses measured on the cadaver vertebrae during the occurrence of impact . By integrating the BCF data which charac- terize the ribs of the population exposed to the risk of thoracic injury, it is possible satisfac- torily to define the tolerance of living road users, in terms of their age. Provided that maximum admissible injury level, and the age for which this limit is required are set, a tolerance criterion can then be defined. DEFINING A TOLERANCE CRITERION is especially important because each condition imposed upon the thorax can have consequences upon the characte- ristics to be required of seat belts and of vehicles, and also upon the mechanical loadings imposed on the other body areas. Several parameters and methods have been used in order to characterize thoracic tolerance. In some cases, published data have been obtained from the impact of a disk against the sternum, *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. but thoracic behaviour differs depending on whether the forces are applied to the thorax with a disk or with a seat belt. The authors set forth below the results of a statistical analysis of data obtained on 29 fresh human cadavers fitted with measuring instruments, subjected to frontal collisions and restrained by a three-point seat belt. These data are restated as protection criteria measu- red on an experimental Part 572 dummy. TEST METHODOLOGY The test subjects were recently deceased, unembalmed cadavers of individuals whose death had occurred four days prior to the test. Pending their use in the laboratory, they had been stored in a cold room (temperature approxi- mately 2° Celsius), from which they were removed several hours before the test. TEST CONDITIONS - The principal data pertaining to the test conditions are shown in Table 1. Depending on the tests, the cadavers were placed either in a vehicle or in a passenger compartment attached to a sled. The sled deceleration in terms of time was obtained by deceleration tubes secured to the front part of the sled. The impact velocities ranged from 44 to 67 km/h, and the sled's stopping distances from 500 to 900 mm. The restraint systems used were three- point seat belts of several types. The cadavers were in either the front-seat passenger position or in the driver's position. PREPARATION OF THE HUMAN CADAVERS - The human cadavers were prepared as already descri- bed in the literature (2). ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS - Precise an- thropometric measurements preceded each test. They are shown in Table 1.

This last datum was used because it partly determines the position of the seat belt with respect to the thorax. After each test, the cadavers were X-rayed and autopsied. Rib fragments were collected for the purpose of characterizing cadaver bone conditions . PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS - Depending on the test, one to four triaxial acceleration trans- ducers were attached to the first, fourth, seventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae. The procedure used for the acceleration measurements conformed to standard SAE J 211b pertaining to measurements of thoracic accelerations. DESCRIPTION OF PARAMETERS USED IN THE STATISTI- CAL ANALYSIS The predictive functions established are multiple linear correlations. They are intended to correlate the severity of thoracic lesions, i.e. AIS (3) and the number of rib fractures, with three groups of parameters which would appear to have an influence on injury data : - cadaver anthropometry, - thorax impact violence, and - bone condition. The BCF (1) is used to characterize the bone condition of the test cadavers. Cadaver BCF are indicated in Table 2. Its equation is as follows : BCF . _[0.117 5Ę2Ł . 0.128 SB™ . 0,41 ïïgp . ïîgài . „.126 ÇÏLL6 „ o,121 "SŁZ22 „ 0.134 BŁ" 4 0.131 SEfiłS] (MMY) : rate of mineralization (LMY) : ash mass/unit of length (mean of the four fragments) (MFS ) : maximum bending force (MCS) : maximum shearing force (WCS) : shearing energy (PFS) : slope of force/deformation curve in bending test (CFS) : maximum bending stress (EFS) : young's module Anthropometry and impact violence to the thorax are represented by parameters described below. DESCRIPTION OF THORACIC LESIONS - It should here be noted that this paper is exclusively concerned with 3-point belt wearing occupants involved in frontal collisions. They are indica- ted in Table 2. In this sample, the test cadavers sustained only rib fractures which were sometimes associated with a fracture of the sternum and/or the clavicle. Injuries of the same kind have also been observed by other teams specialized in human cadaver experiments (4 to 10). Moreover, in our sample, in the absence of flail chest (i.e. AIS ^4), we have not observed any intra-thoracic visceral lesions (for exam- ple, haemothorax - AIS = 3). These results are confirmed by data from real world accidents which show that for 3-point seat belt wearers, the probability of occurrence of such internal injuries, except when associated with flail chest, is very low. Table 3 shows an overview of a sample of 1057 thoracic lesions sustained by 3-point seat belt wearers (11). These data are broken down by ranges of velocity and by age group. It can be seen that for velocity 65 km/h and occupant age ^ 60 years, five cases of internal thoracic injury associated with rib fractures were observed, one of which was a flail chest. In addition, it can be seen in this table that the probability of flail chest increases for V &gt; 65 km/h and for occupants over 60 years. These accident data are confirmed by other studies (12 to 16). Since the predictive functions are used in the range of severity excluding extremely severe injuries (AIS = 4), the number of rib fractures will be a good indicator of thoracic injuries. An advantage, with respect to AIS in general and thoracic AIS in particular, is that the number of rib fractures provides a more continuous scale. Consequently, we will attach greater attention to predictive functions using the number of rib fractures. Remarks - - A sternum was counted as one additional fracture. Clavicle fractures were not counted as supplementary fractures because the loading in this area results in further rib fractures. - Generally, cadaver flail chest was considered to exist when at least 4 adjacent ribs had double fractures. This was defined by ortho- paedic surgeons and pathologists. DEFINITION OF A SINGLE PARAMETER REPRESEN- TATIVE OF THE ANTHROPOMETRY OF TEST CADAVERS Analysis is facilited by using a limited number of parameters. Accordingly, since we did not know, a priori, which anthropometrical data (or which combination thereof) would enable accurate characterization of test cadavers seated in car passenger compartments, we endeavoured, in an initial analysis, to determine a parameter that 6.192</page><page sequence="4">851722 Table 2 : Cadaver Thoracic Injuries - Cadaver Bone Characterization RONF THORACIC INJURIES AmT™T CHARACTERIZATION AmT™T Cadavpr „ Jr TNF STE CLA NRF AIS BCF „ Ref. 33 2 0 0 2 1 - 0.899 41 1 1 0 2 1 - 0.012 44 12 1 0 13 2 - 0.054 47 13 1 1 14 4 0.413 53 3 0 0 3 1 0 . 084 54 0 0 0 0 2 - 0.474 185 17 1 0 18 4 - 1.041 190 6 0 0 6 2 - 0.394 223 15 0 1 15 4 0.248 224 11 0 0 11 2 0.147 246 11 0 0 11 2 0.140 247 8 1 0 9 2 - 0.368 248 10 0 0 10 2 0.344 254 15 1 0 16 4 - 0.039 255 13 1 2 14 4 0.216 257 14 1 1 15 4 - 0.381 258 9 1 0 10 2 - 0.678 267 12 1 0 13 2 - 0.110 268 9 1 0 10 2 - 0.880 276 20 0 1 20 4 0.392 277 10 0 1 10 2 - 0.192 286 0 0 0 0 0 - 2.940 1152 5 1 0 6 2 0.172 1174 9 1 0 10 2 - 0.696 1242 17 1 0 18 4 0.421 1261 17 1 0 18 4 - 0.602 1352 9 0 0 9 2 - 0.206 1362 15 0 0 15 4 0.607 1482 8 0 0 8 2 0.406 1484 12 0 1 12 4 0.304 1841 20 1 1 21 4 0.843 3521 0 0 0 0 0 - 2.004 3532 12 1 0 13 2 - 0.559 Symbol meanings : TNF : Total number of rib fractures STE : Sternum fracture CLA : Clavicle fracture NRF : TNF + STE AIS : Overall thoracic injury severity 6.193</page><page sequence="5">en g 0 G cd O) 1 -p - H en CD C PQ O •H ■P (fl T3 C -H CD •rl r- 1 &lt;D 0 H Q, cu o w 1 o CO -P M O X 0 0 o -p a c e w o M CD G •H fu T3 D T3 § •&gt;-&gt; rH G G 0 M O 00 ^ &lt; O •HHP o cd g cd 0 cd g x a o g x c o H -H O o X 73 O 0 &gt;&gt; &gt; Xl 5 rH 0 O M &gt; &gt; G G M 0 &gt; o co 0 t-' X cd H C'J A _ _ _ CO H O CM X CO H X I X M X UH Uh ' &lt; &gt; - - ' - E X C'J m m uh &lt;0 X co i i i i A A W A A M &lt; LO LO tH M r en X O CM CM CO~ CT ' r Uh 0 O Oh -H Uh CD C'J I II G CO O 3 M 2 ) &lt; G •H CM CM /' v' CT r" ^ CO O CM LO H /' v' ā X r" UH OA ā I H + H CU I I O CM CO CT X CO X + 0 CO ' IH Ch X Öfl H g &lt; - - cd &lt; s* X CM C LO ' Q) CO rH Uh O K I tH I I I G O co 0 X t&gt; CO LO 00 00 -PM XX0h--~-~ &lt; -h a cm co lo h [OH ^ tH C'J CM CO ' Ch O OS CO CM CO CM H I co o MX c &lt; CM- - - - - o X X »-J t-J X -h CM A CMUH^OHLOfuCMCuCMUH -PW At: X CO O CO CO CM C'J W 0 X G X CO O CO CO CM C'J 0 X I H tH I I CM M - XC X co &lt; o o ^ E ►J &lt; o E &lt; ,_| •* T3 H ÖO CM CD cd G LO ' 0 CM MG LO M UH a ' UH X OS lo T i I en h oo o co io o CO H H CM CO •• •• 43 M CO w //-) ^ ^ X U 0 //-) § Nj H . &lt; &lt; Uh X G Nj H . -t ' tH _P O OS LO H O CO H H I (rt ^ o X (rt g XS ' 00 co H CO LO X &lt; O H CM CD CM H O M XI CM CO H Jk.

The analysis finally showed that the four parameters used in the following function were sufficient to represent the anthropometry of the cadavers seated in the vehicle ; this function is termed A.P.B.O. ( Anthropometrical Parameter for Belted Occupant) . The APBO values for cadavers used for the determination of the predictive functions of thoracic injuries are shown in Table 1.

For that purpose, from the available measurements (on T1 , T4, T7 and T12) the following ten parameters were calculated. V : Integral of acceleration over time (m/s) M : Maximum acceleration (g) M3 : Level of acceleration exceeded during 3 ms (g) S : Severity index : integral of power 2.5 acceleration over time P1090 : Average power for overall impact PI 090 = 0 . 5x ( 80% V)2/T1090 (watts/kg) P1050 : Average power during the severe period of the restraint P1050 = 0 . 5x ( 40% V)2/T1050 (watts/kg) PM : Peak power : maximum of the function (acceleration x instantaneous velocity) (watts/kg) BIO : Napierian log of V over 10 ms during which acceleration is greatest B20 : Napierian log of V over 20 ms during which acceleration is greatest J : Average jerk = T"Q^Q (g/s) The calculated parameters are brought together in Table 4. Nota bene - BIO, B20 and powers have sometimes been reported in the literature (18, 19) to describe thoracic injury tolerance, mainly in side impacts. It was thought interesting to verify the relevance of these parameters in frontal colli- sions with belted occupants. - Powers were expressed by unit of mass since this effective mass of the thorax, during i mp ac t , is unknown . - PM is different of the product : (maximum acceleration x maximum velocity) . - P1090 is calculated from 10 % of V to 90 % of V ( that is to say 80 % of V ) . - T1090 is the duration between 10 % of V and 90 % of V (in seconds). - P1050 is calculated from 10 % of V to 50 % of V. - T1050 is the duration between 10 % of V and 50 % of V (in seconds). RESULTS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SEVERITY OF THORA- CIC INJURIES AND CALCULATED PHYSICAL PARAMETERS - Tables 5 and 6 indicate the coefficient of correlation which, in our sample, links thoracic injury (AIS and number of rib fractures) to the 10 parameters used to represent impact violence to the thorax of test cadavers. The results are classified according to the vertebrae on which acceleration was measured. The number of cadavers investigated, for each of the vertebrae on which acceleration was measu- red, is also indicated in Tables 5 and 6. Figures la and 3a illustrate the best results obtained with the AIS (with P1050 on T4). The results obtained at T4 with the acceleration peak exceeding 3 ms (M3) are shown in Figures 2a and 4a. This commonly used physical parameter is employed in the following chapters. 4 • * «nef * * 3 ■ w ¿ 2 - * * * *K*9f * * t • * N » 29 r » 0.55 0 5 1*0 15 5B 25 3*0 35 40 PI 050 (Watts/Kg x 100) Figure la 4 J «OT/V »T7fv7v 7v ^ «OT/V »T7fv7v 7v ui M 3 " Œ a 111 n u '||UU UUM .W.

To this end, we did factor analyses of the corresponden- ces expressed in normed components for the four measurement points with the parameters defined above. These analyses showed that whatever the measurement point considered, the following parameters were the most relevant : P1050, M3, S and B20, and that a linear combination of these parameters did not make it possible to define a new parameter better correlated with the inju- ries, than each of these parameters taken separately. DETERMINATION OF THORACIC INJURY PREDICTIVE FUNCTIONS - The general form of the predictive functions will be stated as follows : AIS or NRF = Kl APBO + K2 BCF + K3 PP + C in which : NRF = number of rib fractures APBO = anthropometrical parameter previously calculated for each cadaver BCF = index for bone characterization of test cadavers PP = physical parameter considered and C, Kl , K2 and K3 are constants calculated automatically by the statistical analysis pro- gram. Analysis of the Respective Influence of the Three Groups of Parameters used in the Predicti- ve Functions for Thoracic Injury - The purpose of this analysis was to appraise the respective effects of the three groups of parameters taken into account (i.e. APBO, BCF and PP shown above) in order to obtain the prediction of thoracic injuries, so as to reduce if possible the number of these parameters. To this end, Student's test, which expres- ses the level of statistical significance between each parameter and the predicted value, was used. It then appeared that, whatever the function considered above, the APBO parameter (anthropometrical parameter) had a negligible influence on the prediction of thoracic inju- ries. It was therefore deleted from the prece- ding equations, which could then be stated as follows : NRF = K1 BCF + K2 P1050 + K3 (1) AIS = K'l BCF + K'2 P1050 + K'3 (2) NRF = K4 BCF + K5 S + K6 (3) AIS = K ' 4 BCF + K ' 5 S + K'6 (4) NRF = K7 BCF + K8 M3 + K9 (5) AIS = K ' 7 BCF + K ' 8 M3 + K'9 (6) NRF = K10 BCF + Kil B20 + K12 (7) AIS = K 1 10 BCF + K 1 11 B20 + K'12 (8). Tables 7 and 9 list the multiple correla- tion coefficients, r, and the Fischer coeffi- cients, f, linking chest injuries (AIS and NRF) to bone condition (BCF) and to the various parameters selected to represent impact violence to the thorax. In these tables : P is the number of cadavers on which the relevant data were available, r is the multiple correlation coefficient, f is the Fischer coefficient. The predictive functions are significant to 1/1000 : when the Fischer coefficient, f, is ^.8.93 for 28 degrees of freedom (29 cadavers), when the Fischer coefficient, f, is ^ 10.39 for 18 degrees of freedom (19 cadavers), when the Fischer coefficient, f, is ^ 10.66 for 17 degrees of freedom (18 cadavers). We also calculated, for each of the functions established, the confidence interval at 95 % : I = m + 1.96 cf ; m is the mean value for the predicted number of rib fractures and Cf is the residual variance. The I values are listed on Tables 7 and 9. These data are classified according to the various measuring points. Analysis of Results Obtained with the AIS The predictive functions are expressed by the following equations : AIS = 99.859 X IO-5 x P1050 + 89.128 X IO-2 x BCF + 60.476 x 10~2 (2) AIS = 246.22 x IO-5 x S + 97.141 x IO-2 x BCF + 122.41 x 10~2 (4) AIS = 2765.7 x IO-5 x M3 + 94.352 x IO-2 x BCF + 113^63 x IO-2 (6) AIS = 249.27 x 10 x B20 + 91.771 X 10 x BCF - 284.98 x 10~2 (8). The coefficients of correlation and Fischer coefficient f values are statistically signi- ficant, especially at T4 and T7. Moreover, the use of Student's test (see Table 8) in each of the predictive functions established confirms that the influence of the physical parameters obtained at T4, particularly P1050, is the greatest. Figure lb illustrates the relation between the AIS observed on the test cadavers and the AIS predicted by function (2) using the BCF and P1050 which gives the best statistical results. The confidence interval at 95 % is + 1.5. In spite of this, it can be seen in Figures la and 2a that, for average power (P1050), in the range of 2100 and 2900 watts/kg and for acceleration between 45 g and 85 g, injuries may be moderate (AIS = 2) or very severe (AIS = 4). It follows that the use of AIS raises problems due to its discontinuity. Figure 2b illustrates the relation between the NRF observed on the test cadavers and the NRF predicted by function (6) using the BCF and M3 . Analysis of Results Obtained with the Number of Rib Fractures - The predictive functions are expressed by the following equa- tions : NRF = (53.901 x IO-3) P1050 + (3.7347) BCF + 21.053 x 10~2 (1) 6.199</page><page sequence="11">NRF = (13.088 X 10 ) S + (4.1648) BCF + 3.6844 (3) NRF = (199.48 x 10 _1 M3 + (4.0195) BCF + 24.622 x 10 (5) NRF = (16.077) B20 + (3.851) BCF - 24.399 (7). Although velocities obtained from spinal accelerometers are subject to directionnal as well as integration errors, the predictive functions have high statistical significance particularly at T4, T7 and T12 (see Table 9). Whatever the measuring point considered, P1050 is the physical parameter which yields the best results. The highest statistical significance values were obtained at T4, particularly with parameter P1050 (r = 0.8 and f = 23.9). Moreover, the use of Student's test (Table 10) in each of the predictive functions establi- shed (Student's t allows appraisal of the influence of each parameter on the prediction) confirms the highest influence of the physical parameters obtained at T4, particularly P1050 which is the only physical parameter with a higher influence on the prediction than the BCF. Figures 3a and 3b illustrate the correla- tion obtained with P1050. COMMENTS - Analysis of the results in Table 9, also showed that as the measuring points become more distant, in a vertical plane, from the center of gravity of the thorax (as T1 and T12 in comparison with T7 and T4), the physical parameters have a lower influence on the prediction than BCF. The effects of the neck on T1 and of the pelvis on T12 may be observed. Moreover, it may be noted that the confi- dence intervals obtained at 95 % are rather high, even at T4 (equation (1), I = + 6.9). This may be attributed to several factors : - the relative position of the seat-belt strap with respect to the thorax of the cadavers ; this position varies depending on the position of seat-belt anchorage points and the height of the cadaver's bust, - the movement of the strap on the thorax during impact, - the non-linearity of rib fractures beyond a certain loading on the chest, with the appearance of posterior arch fractures and/or local thorax "collapse" (these injuries appear only at AIS = 4, i.e. flail chests). The less good results using the accelera- tion peak exceeded during 3 ms (M3) can be partly explained by the fact that this parameter did not take into account either the energy absorbed by the thorax or the impact duration. Inversely, P1050 does take into account these two variables and does so during the most violent impact phase. Other parameters such as the speed of application of the impact forces to the thorax and the surface area receiving these forces represent other important variables needed to define thoracic tolerance. (These data have already been discussed in (32).) For belt wearers, these two last variables are approxima- tely constant. This is an additionnai reason explaining why P1050 is the best descriptor of overall sollicitation of the thorax when restrained by 3-point belt. The set of results obtained in this study obviously calls for confirmation through a larger number of tests carried out with human cadavers of which the bone characterization is known ; however, on the basis of the tests carried out, it may be stated that : - the predictive functions established have a very high statistical significance, - among the physical parameters used, P1050 provides the best description of impact violence to the thorax, particularly at T4, - characterization of cadaver bone condition (BCF) is necessary in interpreting thoracic injuries . EXTRAPOLATION OF PREDICTIVE FUNCTIONS TO HIGHWAY ACCIDENT VICTIMS The extrapolation of these predictive functions to living persons requires knowledge of their bone condition (BCF) and a prior check to ensure that the variables used in calculating test cadaver BCF are equally pertinent to bone condition among the living population exposed to the risk of traffic accidents. To check this point, ribs were removed from 44 individuals (20) following their sudden death (victims of traffic accidents, suicides, etc...), prior to any degradation of their bone condition ; the ribs were tested as described in the reference publication (1) (mineralization and mechanical tests). The variables used to calculate test cadaver BCF were obtained for the ribs of these 44 human subjects. A factorial analysis of the correspondences of principal normed components was performed on the variables and showed that, on the factorial plane representative of overall rib resistance (see figure 9 in (1)), these variables had almost the same projections as those represen- ting the overall rib resistance of the test cadavers. The BCF of each of the 44 human subjects representative of living road users was thus computed using the equation defined in (1). The average age of these 44 subjects was 42 years (standard deviation = 21 years), and their average BCF was -1.2 (standard deviation : BCF = 1) : minimum BCF = -3.45 for a subject 31 years old, maximum BCF = 1.16 for a subject 77 years old. Remark - It may be observed in the Table 2 that certain cadavers had a BCF located in the range of the 44 subjects representative of living road users. PREDICTIVE FUNCTIONS OF THORACIC INJURY TO LIVING PERSONS - We have previously seen that several functions could be used to predict thoracic injuries. In what follows, we shall use only the function which provided the statisti- cally most significant results, i.e. equation (1) with the average power during the severe period of the restraint (P1050).

This choice was imposed by the low coeffi- cient of correlation between age and BCF in the sample of 44 subjects (r = 0.52) which was inadequate to allow determination of BCF by age group for the population exposed to accident risk. This does not mean that there is no relationship between BCF and the age of living occupants but that the available sample (44 subjects) is not large enough to establish such a relationship. The sub-sample consists of 34 subjects of age ^ 60 years : average age = 33 years (standard deviation = 13), average BCF = -1.5 (standard deviation = 0.85), the minimum age of this population was 5 years, the maximum age of this population was 60 years, the minimum BCF for this population was BCF = -3.45 (age 31 years), the maximum BCF for this population was BCF = -0.2 (age 43 years). These values should be confirmed when a large enough number of BCF values characterizing the population exposed to the risk of traffic accidents is available. Figures 5 and 6 made it possible to associate a value for the physical parameter under consideration to a given number of rib fractures. For instance, if it is considered that 8 rib fractures (without flail chest) is a reference injury level, it follows that the values for P1050 and M3 must not exceed 2500 watts/kg and 70 g, respectively. These values represent the most probable human chest tolerance of living belted persons if the maximum admissible injury severity is set at 8 rib fractures without flail chest (AIS = 2), from the analysis of present data. COMMENTS Concerning the choice of 8 rib fractures as an acceptable thoracic injury level - This value was determined by a team of orthopaedic surgeons and clinical pathologists, on the basis of their knowledge both of thoracic injuries observed on belt wearers and of potential associated func- tional problems. It should be pointed out here that even in the absence of flail chest, there may be more than 8 rib fractures, and that their location is of great importance. Concerning the characterization of actual traffic accident victims - The establishment of an average BCF representative of the real world population exposed to risk must be based upon statistics. This has not been possible in the foregoing text, due to the inadequatly small number of available BCF data for the population involved in frontal collisions. In addition, the following data relating to the age distribution of this population must also be borne in mind (21) : 90 % of those involved were between 10 and 60 years old, 80 % of those involved were between 10 and 50 years old, 63 % of those involved were between 10 and 40 years old. Since average thoracic resistance increases when the age bracket is narrowed ( its lower limit however being fixed at ten years), we may reasonnably assume that the average BCF = -1.5 used to established the tolerance threshold of the 10 to 60 age group, represents a very conservative value enabling an adéquat level of thoracic protection for 90 % of living 3-point seat belt wearers in frontal collisions. Furthermore, one is led to believe that, for the same BCF value, the thoracic resistance of the living population is greater than that of cadavers (especially because of their lack of muscular tonicity). One may therefore look upon the -1.5 BCF value as being particularly conservative . DISCUSSION AND COMPARISON WITH DATA FROM THE LITERATURE THORACIC INJURIES - If one wishes to establish human tolerances from experiments involving surrogates, especially human cadavers, it is first of all necessary to ensure that the injuries observed on the cadavers are of the same kind as those seen on real world accident victims who have been subjected to the same level of violence and who were rising the same type of protective devices. For 3-point belt wearers, without a direct violent impact against the thoracic cage (for example, due to major intrusion of the passenger compartment), accident data show that the probability of injury of the intra- thoracic viscera is very low (11 to 16). Table 3, from reference (11), shows this result : out of 984 belted occupants ¿ 60 years old (approximately 90 % of those involved), impact violence being &lt; 65 km/h, 60 occupants sustained thoracic injuries, 2 had a flail chest (AIS = 4) and 3 a haemothorax (AIS = 3) with rib fractures, without a flail chest. We can conclude that injuries to the intra thoracic viscera consecutive to direct impact described by certain authors (22, 23, 24) are not representative of injuries sustained by 3-point belt wearers. 6.203</page><page sequence="15">22 I 1 1 ^ 1 -17 20 X x x ib y y s'' - 16 ZZŽEŽÍI y y s'' - i XXyXr i » - i » : e -zżSSEr - - - e - Xy X XX X " - ~ Xs y XX " 3 - -JļĶZĶZ ~ / Xs y XX 0 / /y / 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 RVERRGE POHER (P1050) Watts/Kg Figure 5 - Predicted number of rib fractures as a function of average power (P1050) measured on T4 and bone characterization (BCF) 22 i 1 1 1 1 1 1 20 oV IB 737^ oV .

This is especially true if injuries AIS 2 only are taken into account. In addition, the similarity of injuries to accident victims and cadavers wearing 3-point belt being established, we can justifiably use cadaver experiment results obtained to determine thoracic tolerance for the living population, with the BCF method described above. HUMAN TOLERANCE - The literature is full of data making it possible to evaluate the toleran- ce of the human thorax. Several physical parameters having this aim are used : deflexion measurements, forces and accelerations. Deflexion Data ( Antero-posterior ) - Most data used relative deflexion (or compression) of the thorax from tests performed with impactors or pendulums striking the thorax at the sternum level (25, 26, 27). Several overviews have been published (22, 23, 25). The most recent shows that, at high pendulum impact speed, the relative compression of the thorax is not sufficient to enable thoracic tolerance to be established (22). This is so because of the visco-elastic characteristics of the intra-thoracic viscera. As we have however shown above, the type of impact is not representative of the way in which belt wearers' thorax is sollicited. The contact surface, the rate of speed increase of the sternum, impact duration, the energy dissipated in the thorax, etc... are amongst the parameters differentiating the consequences for belt wea- rers and those receiving a direct impact to the sternum. Note - Abdominal injuries (liver, spleen, mesentery, etc...) are sometimes seen both on cadavers and accident victims wearing 3-point belts. These injuries are often the results of submarining and of forces applied by the lap belt and not by the torso webbing. The data derived from this latter type of experiments can be used for unrestrained occu- pants but may on no account be transposed to 3-point belt wearers. Nevertheless , it might have been thought that antero-posterior deflexion was a good indicator of thoracic injury severity amongst belt wearers especially if our interest was focused upon injuries below the threshold of tolerance (AIS ^ 4) . Few such data, unfortunately, are available because of the difficulties encountered in measuring deflexion. In reference (2), based on 4 tests, it seems that a relative deflexion of about 30 % is near the level of human tolerance. These results have shown the dominant effect of the bone condition of cadavers used. As an example, cadaver n° 225, tested at 50 km/h had ribs in poor condition and sustained a flail chest ; on the other hand, cadaver n° 258, tested at 65 km/h had rib condition average for the living population and received thoracic injuries at only AIS = 2. Restraint Forces Data - Accident data have shown the influence of age and therefore of the characteristic of thoracic cage (28, 29) upon thoracic injury occurrence by using the breaking force of shock absorbing webbing located at the upper anchorage point as an indicator of forces exerted. This force has often been used in cadaver experiments (2 to 10 and 30). A synthesis of this was presented at the sixth E.S.V. conference (31) in which the force had been normalized, as if all the subjects had weighed 75 kg. A relationship was found connec- ting the severity of the thoracic injuries and the normalized force measured at the shoulder. Unfortunately the bone condition of the cadavers was unknown which made it impossible to transpo- se the results to the living population. Moreover, for a given force applied perpen- dicularly to the thorax, the force measured in the strap can vary to an extremely wide extent depending on the positions of the thoracic strap anchorage points. One of the reasons accounting for the satisfactory correlation between inju- ries and normalized force measured above the shoulder was the large proportion of tests performed in the same test configuration (seat and position of belt anchorage points) (5, 6). A more recent publication (2) used the resulting normalized force (as defined in (31)) applied perpendicularly to the thorax, obtained through dimensional film analysis of the posi- tions of the thorax in relation to the belt. It was then possible to associate the value of 8.50 daN for 8 rib fractures of a human cadaver weighing 75 kg and having a "good" skeleton. Although relevant to the establishment of thoracic tolerance, resultant force is difficult to evaluate because the relative position of strap and thorax is often very imprecise when the occupant is in a vehicle. Another disadvantage is that this parameter cannot easily be transposed into a protection criterion measured on a dummy. Acceleration Data on the Thorax Periphery - It had often been shown that the resultant acceleration peak (maximum or 3 ms) measured on a vertebra could not correctly describe the severity of thoracic injuries. More recently, the so-called 12 accelero- meters method developped for side impacts (18) has been used with restrained cadavers involved in frontal collision experiments (5). We show below, in Table 11, the main results of this study. 9 tests were performed with cadavers within the age range between 19 and 39 years of the population at risk. If we consider the resultant acceleration at T12 (which, it will be recalled, enables better prediction of thoracic injury than at T1 (see Table 9)) and the number of fractures observed on cadavers, we see that these results are distributed along the curve representing the 6.205</page><page sequence="17">IT) CO -P CO TD CO •H U 0 •H i- I i - I CO * r- 1 t- I (1) i - I X CO H 3 CO ECU CO CU CO 00 00 CU CO o I- I I • • • • ... .

This result is very interesting although derived from T12. It confirms the accuracy of the predictive functions which were formerly based upon experiments performed with fairly old cadavers but whose bone condition compared with that of living people was known. PROTECTION CRITERIA - The predictive func- tions established above have shown that, for a given value of the physical parameter, the number of rib fractures depends practically solely upon the cadaver bone condition (BCF). This means that, on the basis of the level reached by the physical parameter under conside- ration, we can predict the number of rib fractures which a living occupant of average bone resistance (BCF = -1.5) would have sustai- ned in the same impact conditions. In order to obtain the protection criterion corresponding to this injury prediction, we need to perform a dummy test which involves identical violence . A sufficient number of dummy tests in cadaver test conditions will make it possible to establish the relationship between the predic- tion of injuries which living occupant would have sustained and the corresponding protection criteria observed on the dummy. These data are not currently available. Nevertheless, for the time being, it is possible to use certain data already published. Kallieris - He shows (5) of 5 tests performed with the Part 572 dummy in the same impact conditions as those of involving the 9 cadaver tests presented in Table 11. The average acceleration peak value excee- ded 3 ms is 37 g on the Part 572 dummy. We can see that the average values of the relationship cadaver peak acceleration (3 ms) dummy peak acceleration (3 ms) are, respectively, 1 and 1.24 when acceleration at T1 and T12 are used. If we hypothesise that the relationships are relatively constant whatever the impact conditions (which need to be demonstrated) , we can transpose the level of physical parameters obtained with cadavers into data calculated on the Part 572 dummy. Moreover, if we accept that the T4 measure- ments lie within those obtained between T1 and T12, we can predict the number of fractures which a living occupant with average bone condition (BCF = -1.5) would have sustained as a function of the value of the physical parameter calculated for the dummy on the basis of the relationship established above. Figure 8 illustrates the results thus obtained . If we accept that 8 fractures on a living occupant of average bone resistance represents the acceptable limit of thoracic injury severi- ty, the resultant acceleration peak (3 ms) on a Part 572 dummy should be found to be within the range 56 g and 70 g. ^ Kallieris data ^ 12 • o ir 4?

The author even associates with an acceleration value (3 ms) of 38 g on the Part 572 dummy : 26 thoracic AIS = 0, 2 thoracic AIS = 1, and 2 thoracic AIS = 2. The AIS 1 and AIS 2 injuries were observed in accidents involving a direct impact against the vehicle interiors. Patrick (34), on the basis of real- world accident reconstructions associates 60 g (3 ms) measured on a Sierra 1050 dummy with levels of thoracic injury of AIS &lt;2 for the road acci- dents under consideration. Note - Although it is a parameter that is more appropriate for describing tolerances, the average mechanical power P1050 has not been used as a protection criterion on a dummy due to the lack of available dummy data. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The set of results obtained requires confirmation through a larger number of experi- ments on dummies and on cadavers in the same test conditions and a better knowledge of the bone condition of the population exposed to the risk of traffic accidents. The results have their greatest validity for conditions approa- ching the experimental test conditions, i.e. impact velocities from 44 to 67 km/h and vehicle deceleration distances from 500 to 900 mm. The results may be summarized as follows. HUMAN TOLERANCE FOR 3-P0INT BELT WEARERS - For the thorax body segment , cadavers are good surrogates for the living vehicle occupants on condition that bone condition is known (a parameter that is essential in the data analysis stage ) . The number of rib and sternum fractures on the living population and on cadavers is a good indicator of the severity of thoracic injuries, especially if one's concern is limited to those injuries below the threshold of tolerance, that is to say AIS ¿ 2. Because of its discontinuity, the AIS scale is ill-suited for defining predictive functions for thoracic injuries. Anthropometrical variables have very little influence on injury. Several physical parameters calculated from the deceleration pulse measured on these verte- brae may be used. The most statistically significant predic- tive functions were obtained with T4 and T7 (mainly on T4). The value for average power during the severe period of the restraint (P1050) yields the best results. If the value of 8 rib fractures without flail chest or internal lesions (very rare for this injury level) is considered to be the reference limit, the thoracic tolerance of living belted persons of age ^ 60 years corresponds to the following values : average power during the severe period of the restraint (P1050) = 2500 watts/kg (from T4) , maximum level of acceleration exceeded during 3 ms (M3 ) = 70 g (from T4). PROTECTION CRITERIA ON THE PART 572 DUMMY - A value in the range 56 g and 70 g measured on a Part 572 dummy seems to correspond to an acceptable level of injury for the restrained population exposed to risk of accident. These data confirm the relevance of the "60 g (3 ms)" criterion currently used for certain rule-making. REFERENCES (1) J. Sacreste, F. Brun-Cassan, A. Fayon, C. Tarriere, C. Got, A.
