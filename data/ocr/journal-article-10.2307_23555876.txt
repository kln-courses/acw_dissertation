Barrett Centre for Anthropology &amp; Mind, Institute of Cognitive &amp; Evolutionary Anthropology, University of Oxford, 64 Banbury Road, Oxford, OX2 6PN United Kingdom justin.barrett@anthro.ox.ac.uk Abstract Boyer's theory of counterintuitive cultural concept transmission claims that concepts that ideas that violate naturally occurring intuitive knowledge structures enough to be attention-demand ing but not so much to undermine conceptual coherence have a transmission advantage over other concepts (Boyer et al. 2001: 535-64). Because of the prominence of these counterintuitive concepts in religious belief systems, Boyer's theory features prominendy in many cognitive treat ments of religion. Difficulties in identifying what are and are not counterintuitive concepts in this technical sense, however, has made empirical treatment of Boyer's theory irregular and dif ficult to evaluate. Further, inability to quantify just how counterintuitive a given concept is has made ambiguous specifying where the alleged cognitive optimum lies. The present project attempts to clarify Boyer's theory and presents a formal system for coding and quantifying the "counterintuitiveness" of a concept, and hence, facilitates empirical scrutiny of the theory. Keywords cognitive science of religion, religious concepts, counterintuitive, cultural transmission Exploring regular human cognitive capacities and conceptual systems contin ues to produce helpful explanatory insights into both the regularity and vari ability of cultural expression (Sperber et al. 2004: 40-46). For ideas to be "cultural" or "religious" (as opposed to idiosyncratic) they must successfully spread within a group, and for ideas to spread they must be readily represented by human minds in ways that produce identifiably similar public expressions (Sperber 1996). Hence, understanding how cognitive systems support or 1 The author thanks Pascal Boyer, Emma Cohen, Joe Henrich, Nicola Knight, Anders Lis dorf, Brian Malley, Bob McCauley, Tenelle Porter, and Rich Sosis for comments and suggestions.

Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 309 discourage certain types of ideas is a critical component in understanding what is and isn't "religious." As a central theory in the cognitive science of religion, Pascal Boyer's theory of the transmission of counterintuitive ideas has generated considerable theo retical and empirical attention (e.g., Barrett, 2000, 2004a, 2004b; Barrett &amp; Nyhof, 2001; Boyer, 2003; Boyer &amp; Ramble, 2001; Gonce et al. 2006; Noren zayan et al. 2006; Pyysiâinen, Lindeman &amp;C Honkela, 2003; Tremlin, 2006; Tweney et al. 2006; Upal, et al., 2007). In brief, Boyer hypothesizes that con cepts with a small number of counterintuitive features are (generally) better remembered and more faithfully communicated than extremely counterintui tive concepts or comparable ordinary or even unusual concepts. Boyer argues that cross-culturally many religious concepts are counterintuitive in this tech nical sense, facilitating their successful transmission, and hence, partly explain ing their existence.2 In this way, cognitive architecture informs and constrains the scope of candidates for successful religious concepts. Empirical support for this hypothesis (variously termed the cognitive opti mum theory and rhe Minimal Counterintuitiveness (MCI) theory, as described more fully below) has been mixed, with three articles reporting series of exper iments in support of the theory's predictions (Barrett et al. 2001: 69-100; Boyer et al. 2001: 535-64; Upal et al. 2007; 1-25), and three reporting results either inconsistent with the theory's predictions or requiring substantive mod ification (Gonce et al. 2006: 521-47; Norenzayan et al. 2006: 531-53; Tweney et al. 2006: 483-98). Just as notable as the differences in results are the differ ences in how 'counterintuitive' was operationalized for the different experi ments. These empirical studies reflect only modest agreement concerning what does and does not constitute a public representation of a counterintuitive idea. Perhaps these differences alone account for the differences in results. For the MCI theory (as I call it) to continue to be fruitful in the study of religious concepts, this ambiguity regarding how to identify (or generate) pub lic representations of counterintuitive concepts must be resolved. After pro viding more theoretical grounding for the project, I attempt to create a scheme for identifying and coding counterintuitive concepts. Further, I suggest a heu ristic for quantifying just how counterintuitive an idea is. Developing the for malism of a coding and quantification scheme clarifies the scope and predictions of a defensible MCI theory. My hope is that this formalism will add more precision and uniformity to hypothesis testing relevant to the MCI theory. 2 Boyer (2001, 2003) has identified other features of many religious concepts in addition to their counterintuitiveness, and does not regard counterintuitiveness as either necessary or suffi cient for a concept to be regarded as "religious."</page><page sequence="3">310 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 I. Intuitive Knowledge and Cultural Expression For quite some time, cognitive developmental psychologists have talked about intuitive knowledge, assumptions, or expectations of children. By "intuitive" they refer to cognition that does not require or does not allow for conscious inspection of the principles involved. Further, intuitive expectations are assumed to be largely invariable across cultural contexts, arising through the course of normal development through the interaction of human biology and typically human natural and social environments. Whether some of this intu itive knowledge is innate or rather the product of learning remains an open question for empirical inquiry and debate. But both the empiricists and nativ ists seem to agree that by early childhood, a certain set of intuitive knowledge is present in children. For instance, there is little doubt that sometime in early development, children acquire the intuitive expectation that bounded physical objects cannot pass directly through other bounded physical objects. That infants 'know' this property of physical objects does not entail that they can consciously reflect on it or verbally articulate it. Rather, they know it intui tively in the sense that it is assumed without conscious reflection. Recently, philosopher Robert McCauley (forthcoming) has usefully described this intuitive knowledge as maturationally natural. That is, as a natu ral product of human maturation in ordinary human environments, certain motor and conceptual competencies are acquired with great fluency and auto maticity. Walking is maturationally natural in this sense, as is knowing that physical objects require support, or else they fall. Maturationally natural cognition—or intuitive knowledge—does not require great conscious resources but readily springs into action whenever needed. In addition to this automa ticity and fluency, maturationally natural competencies, according to McCau ley, are generally (but not always) marked by developing so early that by adulthood we do not remember a time that we did not possess the compe tency. Further, acquiring these competencies occurs without special artefacts or explicit tuition. Maturationally natural competencies show relatively little variation within or across groups. McCauley contrasts maturational naturalness with practiced naturalness? Fie notes that with the right sort of training or practice one can acquire auto maticity and fluency in motor and conceptual capacities that seem to rival that which is characteristic of the maturationally natural. Consider the cognitive skills of a chess master or the performance of a concert violinist. Nevertheless, 3 This labeling should not lead one to assume that maturationally natural competencies do not require practice whereas practiced naturalness does. It isn't the practice that distinguishes these two types of natural cognition but their inevitability.</page><page sequence="4">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 311 this sort of naturalness requires special artefacts (e.g., a chess set or violin), typically involves explicit instruction, and varies considerably both within groups (few become chess masters) and across groups (some cultures have more chess masters than others). Cultural schemata and scripts (e.g., how one orders food in a restaurant) may acquire this practiced naturalness in people. I raise McCauley's distinction because it emphasizes that what I refer to here as intuitive cognition (what he would call maturationally natural) is not the product of particular cultural conditions, but may be regarded as pan human. Hence, it plays a role in all thought and communication regardless of cultural particulars. Further, intuitive cognition occurs early in development. Hence, it plays a role in shaping thought and communication from the early years of life. This notion of intuitive cognition has been imported quite successfully into explanations of recurrent cultural patterns. Simply put, ideas that match intu itive cognition are likely to appear widely within and across cultures. And why not? Largely intuitive ideas are not only likely to spontaneously appear in individual minds (in part because somewhere in our minds, their elements already lurk), but also to spread readily from person to person (because, again, somewhere in our minds, their elements already lurk). For instance, learning about a previously unfamiliar animal that meets all intuitive expectations for animals is easy because a host of presumed features need not be explicitly com municated. When explaining the features of a large South American rodent, I need not mention that it moves in goal-directed ways, that it seeks nourish ment to survive, that it may die, that its parents and offspring will be of the same species, that it has internal parts that serve the animal's survival needs, that it is composed of natural materials, that it exists continually in space and time, that it cannot pass through solid walls, that it is subject to gravity, and so forth. All of these intuitive expectations come for free. The reason intuitive cognition plays such a powerful role in explaining var ious cultural phenomena is that whether or not an idea or practice is intuitive (in the sense of being the product of maturationally natural systems) is not anchored to a particular cultural context. Such considerations are not cultur ally variable. Intuitive cognition is regarded as part of basic human nature and thereby can be appealed to for explaining cross-cultural recurrence. II. Minimally Counterintuitive Concepts A particularly productive application of these insights concerning the ability for intuitive knowledge to inform and constrain cultural expression has been in the area of fictional, mythical, and especially religious ideas, championed</page><page sequence="5">312 J. L. Barrett I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 most prominently by Boyer (Boyer 1994; 2001; 2003:119-24). Boyer has argued that ideas or concepts that largely conform to intuitive expectations are readily acquired, remembered, and communicated from person to person. As such, they have the potential to spread within and across cultures (Boyer 1994; 2001; see also Sperber 1996; Sperber et al. 2004: 40-46). These connections with intuitive cognition, then, form the backbone of an epidemiology of rep resentations (Sperber 1996). Significantly, what Boyer has added to this emphasis on successful concepts having to be largely intuitive is that an idea that is a slightly counterintuitive idea might actually spread better than a com parable idea that does not violate any intuitive expectations. That is, if an idea or concept explicitly violates an intuitive expectation (but otherwise affirms relevant intuitive cognition, at least tacitly), the idea may combine ease of understanding with something striking that catches attention and makes the concept more interesting, more memorable, and worth talking about. Consider the idea of a 'statue that rusts' with the idea of a 'statue that cries' As much as one might be interested in a description of an oxidizing sculpture, hearing about a statue crying is much more striking and worthy of retelling. Why? Boyer suggests that it is because one version is wholly intuitive and the other counterintuitive. Even three-year-old children know that artefacts do not cry, but that crying is a behavior in the domain of living things. Hence, a statue that cries is counterintuitive. This technical sense of "counterintuitive" allows for an idea or concept to be intuitive in two ways. First, an idea may be specified by maturationally natural cognitive systems. For instance, that solid objects cannot pass through other solid objects appears to be a default assumption or expectation of maturation ally natural cognitive systems. The idea of a rock that cannot pass through a wall is intuitive because it conforms to default assumptions. A second way in which an idea may be intuitive is by simply not violating expectations. The idea of a 300 pound cucumber is intuitive (even if surprising) because matu rationally natural systems do not specify how much cucumbers can or cannot weigh.4 Boyer's proposed advantage for counterintuitive ideas is not without limits. Rather, he suggests an optimum. Ideas that are mundanely intuitive are accept able candidates for being successfully spread within a population, those with 4 At least, we have no evidence that boundaries on weight or size are specified beyond, per haps, the general sense that they should be 'medium-size' objects—not microscopic, and not on the scale of planets or galaxies. In keeping with Boyer's and others' previous research in this area, I reserve the term counterintuitive for ideas that violate maturationally natural expectations. Nev ertheless, just as one may acquire practiced naturalness, ideas may run counter to practiced natural expectations. I term ideas that violate these practiced natural expectations countersche matic.</page><page sequence="6">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 313 just a minor counterintuitive tweak are better, and those with too many coun terintuitive features are disastrous. Consider a statue that cries tears made of pine sap whenever it reads someone's mind and finds that the person intends to do something that would please the statute only if the act happened exactly ten years from next Friday at noon. Such a statue concept (if indeed it can be called a concept) so greatly violates intuitive conceptual structure that it would be hard to understand and communicate effectively without distortion. Fur thermore, its counterintuitive structure renders it cumbersome for generating predictions, explanations, or inferences. A large, slightly-oxidized bronze statue of a muscular bearded man with one hand raised and the other holding a book that cries real tears does not present the same conceptual challenges for its communication or for its ability to generate predictions, explanations, or inferences. To summarize, largely (but not entirely) intuitive concepts are "good" for transmission, and massively counterintuitive ones are "bad" (but not impos sible). But this formulation raises a problem. Flow does one quantify counter intuitiveness? If Boyer has proposed an optimum, how many counterintuitive properties must it incorporate? Can we be more precise than somewhere between wholly intuitive and ridiculous? Below I attempt to clarify matters. Before sketching what I take to be a means of more precisely specifying the counterintuitive character of a given concept or idea, let me make an impor tant qualification. Boyer and others' sense of what is and is not intuitive is dependent on ongoing empirical and theoretical research in developmental and cross-cultural psychology. What falls within or outside the body of intui tive, maturationally natural, pan-cultural knowledge continues to prompt disagreement. For my analysis below, I appeal to what I take to be the likely range of intuitive knowledge based on current relevant evidence, but I am certain that as the relevant science progresses, this range will require revision. What counts as intuitive knowledge is an empirical issue, however confident we may be about most of what counts. Because the scope of what properly counts as intuitive is a work in progress, gray cases in any classification scheme will appear. One area of possible modification may be that fewer or more areas of cognitive naturalness (in McCauley's sense) may prove to be the product of practiced naturalness rather than maturational naturalness. I also restrict my discussion to objects (broadly construed), thereby avoid ing whether events (e.g., a collision, a sunrise, a competition, an examination), substances (e.g., oxygen, water, metal), or abstractions (e.g., goodness, law, brightness, a poem, an idea) might properly be considered intuitive or coun terintuitive in the technical sense that Boyer has developed. Indeed, we have little reason to believe that abstract concepts activate pan-human cognitive systems in the same way as objects or intentional agents, given that they do</page><page sequence="7">314 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 not constitute a domain for causal cognition. Not surprisingly, then, Boyer's examples of counterintuitive concepts avoid abstractions or events and instead focus on 'persons' (meaning humans); 'artefacts' or 'tools'; and 'plants', 'ani mals', or 'living things' (Boyer 1994; 2001; Boyer et al. 2001: 535-64). Without more relevant evidence, describing abstractions in terms of counterintuitiveness would be inappropriate. I propose six 'steps' for coding a concept, and determining the degree of 'counterintuitiveness' from that coding. This degree of counterintuitiveness may be used to make a number of empirical predictions described near the end of this essay. I leave aside another sense in which something might be considered "coun terintuitive." If an entity brings about counterintuitive events, it is "counter intuitive" in its causability but does not have any ontologically counterintuitive properties. Consider a relic considered that heals those that touch it in compari son to a relic that is invisible. The first can be used to bring about an event that may be counterintuitive (e.g. instantaneous restoration of sight), whereas the second has a property that is counterintuitive in Boyer's sense. It may be that these two senses of being "counterintuitive" have different representational properties and different transmissive potential. Because Boyer's theory only directly addresses the second sort (the invisible relic), I leave aside those objects that are counterintuitive by virtue of causability and focus instead on ontologi cally counterintuitive entities for the present discussion and coding scheme. III. Coding Counterintuitiveness When discussing how to construct or how to identify and code counterintui tive concepts/ideas/representations, it is critically important to recognize that such a project actually entails coding public representations for their likely pri vate representational structure. Dan Sperber (1996) distinguishes between pub lic and private representations, noting that it is through public representations (e.g., actions, speech acts, artifacts, writings) that we try to recreate in others particular private representations (e.g., ideas, emotions, mental states). Tech nically, then, "a mountain that thinks" is a public representation that has a relationship to particular private representations in a reader. An unambiguous public representation prompts similar private representations in other indi vidual conceptual systems. Hence, if the utterance "a mountain that thinks" (a public representation) tends to activate similar private representations across individual hearers of the utterance, it is a relatively unambiguous public rep resentation. For ease of communication, I will assume that my examples of concepts/ideas/representations have a transparent relationship between the</page><page sequence="8">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 315 public representation and private representations. Hence, I will write as if "a mountain that thinks" is a minimally counterintuitive concept (or representa tion). What I mean by this language is that I regard the expression "a moun tain that thinks" as likely to evoke in all fluent, English speakers with normal conceptual systems a similar minimally counterintuitive private representa tion. By calling "an immortal human" a MCI idea, I mean that I regard the public representation "an immortal human" as likely to consistently evoke a private representation that violates an intuitive assumption about humans, that is, a MCI concept. The importance of this distinction between private and public representa tions can be seen by examining an example from the empirical literature on MCI theory. Norenzayan, et al. s example of the "thirsty door" is regarded as transferring "a folkbiological property (thirst) from its proper category (ani mal or plant) to an improper category (inert object/substance)" (2006: 537). For the "thirsty door" item to be a successful stimulus in the experiment, Norenzayan, et al. must be confident that the public representation "thirsty door" evokes in their participants a similar private representation that indeed includes transferring a folk biological property to an improper ontological category. If, on the other hand, "thirsty door" evokes in many readers a private representation that has something to do with the dryness of a wooden door or how readily the door absorbs paint or no clear, consistent private representa tions across individuals, then "thirsty door" cannot be confidently called a MCI concept. Perhaps "thirsty door" is, instead, a metaphor that activates dif ferent representations in different audiences.5 One other observation is required before turning to the six steps for coding counterintuitive concepts and quantifying their degree of counterintuitive ness. Human cognitive systems generally strive for representational and com putational efficiency and simplicity (Sperber et al. 1995). Given the option of a complex representation or a simple one, human minds generally prefer that which is more simple. For instance, a chair with both the biology and the mind of a human is more simply represented as a human in the form of a chair. Though a given individual might insist that the counterintuitive chair (with human biology and psychology) is more a chair than a human, through many iterations and transmissions, and when used to generate predictions, explanations, and other inferences in real time, the conceptually simpler ver sion would emerge. This Simplicity Principle has many implications for how people are likely to represent counterintuitive concepts, and some of these implications are noted in the following discussion. 5 It is worth noting that MCI concepts in folktales, films, and religions are not typically understood as metaphors.</page><page sequence="9">316 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 The Simplicity Principle also motivates a rule for the proposed coding scheme that operates throughout the steps. Lets call this rule the Simplicity Rule. The Simplicity Rule states that when coding concepts, assume the simplest (i.e., least counterintuitivej conceptual representation that captures the object's properties. Assume that the proper interpretation of an utterance or verbal representation is the one that requires less suspension of intuitive expectations and is, therefore, less effortful (Sperber and Wilson 1995). The contexts I have in mind for coding public representations for counter intuitiveness are single communicative episodes such as a folktale, a conversa tion, a ritual, or on-line, real-time interactions with ideas or items. The unit of analysis I am attempting to capture is the structure of a single individual's private representation of any given public representation. What is not intended is, for instance, a tabulation of all of the different ways in which people gener ally use the term 'God' and what could be meant by it, as if the universal semantic scope of the term is indicative of any given individual's private rep resentation in any real-time episode. Coding how the Ghost of Christmas Present in Dickens' A Christmas Carol would likely be privately represented by the audience members is the sort of problem imagined here, not coding for how people use the term 'ghost' in the English speaking world generally. For the sake of brevity, my examples below do not offer contexts that might help to clarify (or muddy) the coding of likely private representations. With these preliminary considerations in mind, please consider the six steps for coding counterintuitives. Step One: Identify the Basic Level Membership The basic level category is the level of object categorization that minimizes differences within members of the category while maximizing differences between categories (Rosch et al. 1976: 573-605). The basic level is typically the category membership first learned for any given object in the course of development and usually the first category to be linguistically marked. Fortunately, an easy and reliable heuristic exists for identifying something's basic level. Simply answer the question, "In one word, what is it called?" The one-word, common, first-learned label for an object is almost always its basic level (in English). Examples include "apple," "cat," "chair," "shoe," "cup," "rock," and "shadow." More precisely, the shortest, one word, common label for an object usually picks out its basic level category membership. Hence, in identifying basic level category membership, a golden retriever is classed as a dog, not as a golden retriever (a subordinate category) or as a mammal, an animal, or a living thing (superordinate categories). A recliner is classed as a</page><page sequence="10">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 317 chair, not as a recliner, as furniture, or as an artefact (for the sake of coding, I will use all-capitals to designate a basic level word). If the basic level cannot be identified, it may be possible to move on to Step 2 anyway, but gathering more information (e.g., from the text or informant, depending on the source of the public representation, or additional contextual information) is prudent.6 Step Two: Identify the Ontological Category or Categories For this discussion, objects may be thought of as falling in one or more of five ontological categories: Spatial Entities, Solid Objects, Living Things that do not appear to be self-propelled, Animates, and Persons. These are intuitive onto logical categories and do not necessarily map onto genuine ontological dis tinctions. These five ontological categories arise from differential activation of five dif ferent intuitive expectation sets I am calling Spatiality, Physicality, Biology, Ani macy, and Mentality. These expectation sets are not ontological categories but, as specified below, different combinations of their activation characterize intu itive ontological categories. Table One (see Appendices) summarizes these intuitive expectation sets and their characteristic implicit assumptions. By Spatiality, I mean those intuitions that govern objects, substances, and other entities that might be located in space. I am hazarding that the primary assumptions here are that all objects (and substances) have a specifiable loca tion in space and time. Further, Spatiality is distinguishable as a specific domain of reasoning from object Physicality (described below), because some things such as clouds and shadows (and perhaps minds, as discussed below) are not intuitively regarded as having all the same properties as bounded phys ical objects but yet have spatial properties. A cloud is in one place. If you divide a cloud you get two clouds, each with their own location. Spatiality assumptions apply to clouds, other Spatial Entities, and all five categories of object under discussion here. But clouds do not meet the intuitive assump tions I refer to as Physicality. Physicality includes at least the intuitive expectations of cohesion, solidity, continuity, and contact (Spelke 1990: 49-56; Spelke et al. 2007: 89-96). Cohe sion refers to objects moving as connected wholes. Solidity entails that solid objects do not readily pass directly through each other or occupy the same space and at the same time as each other. That objects have continuity means 6 It may be that the basic kind is a class you suspect is counterintuitive such as 'ghost' or 'god.' If so, an ontologically similar basic kind label may be selected or the step skipped and returned to after further consideration using the subsequent steps.</page><page sequence="11">318 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 that for them to move from point A to point B, they must traverse the inter mediate space (as opposed to teleporting). Finally, objects move based on con tact. For an object at rest to begin moving, it must be launched through contact. For it to change course or stop abruptly, contact is necessary. This set of intuitive expectations are sometimes called folk or naïve physics and appear to be part of a human's reasoning during infancy (Spelke 1990: 49-56; Spelke et al. 2007: 89-96). We can add to these properties two perceptible features presumed by these studies in early infancy: being visible and tangible. Biology (more typically called folk biology) includes the intuitive expecta tions of growth and development (Rosengren et al 1991: 1302-20; Flatano et al. 1994: 171-88), internal parts that sustain life or Vital force' (Inagaki et al. 2002; Inagaki et al. 2006: 177-81; Keil 1992: 103-38), vulnerability to death (meaning cessation of biological processes) (Slaughter 2005:179-86), and reproduction of like kinds (Hatano et al. 1994: 171-88; Springer et al. 1989: 637-84). Further, Biology assumes composition of natural substances and not manufactured materials (Simons et al. 1995: 129-63). All of these properties arise out of a single, unseen, kind-specific "essence" that generates and accounts for the physically observable features (Keil 1989). Animacy adds to Biology the expectation that a thing is "self-propelled" (Premack 1990: 1-16) or has "Force" (Leslie 1995: 121-149). That is, it can act in or on its environment and not merely be acted upon. Being able to move oneself from one location to another in space is "self-propelledness," but the concept also captures instances of animacy such as changing appearance (e.g., by size or shape change or illumination), or by making noise (e.g., a cry or utterance). Further, in animacy, this self-propelledness is perceived as con stituting goal-directed action; for instance, to communicate, avoiding some thing, threaten, or move to a particular location (not just moving aimlessly). Mentality (often called folk psychology or Theory of Mind) extends Animacy to include assumptions that a thing's activity is guided and shaped by percepts, beliefs, desires, emotions, and perhaps personality. For instance, a mental being will act to satisfy desires, satisfied desires result in positive emotions, percepts inform beliefs about desired objects, and so forth. Though some might disagree and wish to add to these five expectation sets, collapse them (e.g., combining Animacy with Mentality, or Spatiality with Physicality), or reduce their number (e.g., omit Biology), I suggest these five because of their general support in the cognitive developmental literature, their apparent independence in developmental course, and their general map ping onto what appear to be reasonable proper domains of the natural world throughout human existence. Clear evidence for Physicality in humans exists within the first few months of life and appears robust in adult non-human primates. Flence, it has been dubbed part of core knowledge' (Spelke &amp;</page><page sequence="12">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 319 Knizler 2007: 89-96). What I demarcate as Spatiality is often collapsed into Physicality (because research has primarily concerned physical objects), but I give it independence because of its relevance for reasoning about a distinct domain: non-massive but Spatial Entities such as shadows, clouds, conglomer ates (e.g., pile of leaves), and flames. These Spatial Entities have locations but do not activate all the Physicality expectations of a Solid Object. I am further motivated to divide Spatiality and Physicality into distinct expectation sets by Paul Bloom's work on "intuitive dualism" that suggests minds are intuitively represented as non-physical things that may, nevertheless, have spatial proper ties such as a specifiable location (Bloom 2004; see also Cohen 2007). Evi dence for Animacy expectations, too, appears in early infancy (Gergely et al. 2003: 287-92) and might be considered core knowledge (Spelke et al. 2007: 89-96). That it is readily applied years before a folk biology clearly emerges, before clear evidence of mentalistic reasoning, and has a ready proper domain of application in simple, non-social animals (e.g., snails, worms, etc.), moti vates me to leave Animacy independent of both Mentality and Biology. I am certainly not claiming that animals and humans do not activate Biology expec tations. I am claiming that Animacy and Mentality might be activated with out Biology. Hence, some "Animates" could be represented without Biology. It may be that by the time a robust theory of mind or Mentality develops, all animate objects are intuitively expected to be mentalistic agents {Persons). If so, a snail with mental states would be intuitive; suggesting that it has no mental states would be counterintuitive. On the other hand, it may be that humans intuitively restrict mentalistic agency to only a small number of mam mals or even only to other humans. If so, the attribution to animals of rich mental states that seems so common among pet owners, for example, might be minimally counterintuitive (though perhaps with great practiced natural ness). These matters deserve more experimental attention. Folk biology may be the latest developing intuitive expectation set with most of its expectations emerging around age four or five (Inagaki et al. 2002; Keill989). Late developing or not, folk biology certainly adds a number of expectations relevant to reasoning about living things not captured by the other intuitive expectation sets. The final expectation set, Universals, is tacit in essentially all research on the other reasoning systems. Universals are expectations that apply to all reasoning in any domain. They include such assumptions as time moves in one direc tion, laws and regularities are constant from moment to moment, and causes precede effects. Differential activation of these five intuitive expectation sets carve the world's objects into the classes of Spatial Entities, Solid Objects, Living Things, Animates, and Persons—an intuitive ontology (Keil 1979). If a thing activates</page><page sequence="13">320 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 Universals and Spatiality but no other expectation set, its intuitive ontological category is Spatial Entities. If a thing activates Universals, Spatiality, and Phys icality but no other expectation sets, its intuitive ontological category is Solid Objects. The complete set of relationships among expectation set activation and ontological category membership is represented in Table Two (see Appen dices). As intuitive, usually implicit categorizations, they do not necessarily map onto scientific or philosophically defensible divides, or even how ordi nary people would categorize the same objects across all contexts. People treat clouds and shadows as Spatial Entities—entities with specifiable locations and even, perhaps, identifiable boundaries, but not Solidity. Solid Objects includes both artefacts (e.g., chairs, shoes, pencils) and natural non-living objects (e.g., stones, icebergs). People classify trees, mushrooms, sea sponges, and many other (apparently) non-moving biological kinds into Living Things. The cate gory Animates may typically include animals that appear to propel themselves such as sharks, earthworms, crickets, and bunnies, but in some situations may include non-animals such as complex machines. Persons captures human beings, and perhaps (depending upon how they are conceptualized) some ani mals such as chimpanzees and the family dog. (Exactly which animals are intuitively granted full-blown minds, albeit slightly different than humans', is unknown and likely quite variable.) Note that contrary to how I understand Boyer's use of the term 'person' (Boyer 1994; Boyer 2001) here 'Person' is not synonymous with 'human. ' Spatiality, Physicality, Biology, Animacy, and Mentality do not exhaust the different sets of intuitive expectations applied to things in the world. Some evidence exists that artefacts may be discriminated from other Solid Objects by virtue of their activation of a set of functional expectations (Casier et al. 2007: 120-30; Keil 1995: 234-67). As this is an area of rapid development and does not change my general analysis, I leave artefacts and natural non-living objects together in one group. Further, I assume all entities are intuitively subject to the set of intuitive expectations I call Universals. As displayed in Table One, the relationship between expectation sets and ontological categories is not strictly hierarchical. By virtue of activating the same expectation sets, Solid Objects assume and extend the properties of Spa tial Entities, and Living Things also assume and extend the properties of Solid Objects and Spatial Entities. But evidence suggests that things which are intu itively categorized as Animates do not necessarily activate the same expecta tions as Living Things. For instance, complex machines including computers may be conceptualized using the kind of goal-directed or teleological agency reasoning without assuming Biology. Indeed, this type of reasoning about Animates arises during infancy and is evident in other species (Gergely et al. 2003: 287-92), presumably before folk biological reasoning emerges, suggest</page><page sequence="14">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 321 ing its independence from the Biology expectation set that marks Living Things off from Solid Objects. Though the vast majority of Animates that we represent (i.e., animals) do activate Biology, the differences in developmental and probably evolutionary courses suggests the relative independence of the Animacy and Biology expectation sets. The observation that Persons and Animates (as opposed to humans) do not automatically assume the biological and physical properties of animals is a departure from previous discussions of counterintuitives (Boyer 1994). Nev ertheless, I find support for this departure in the recent research on the devel opment of Theory of Mind and teleological agency reasoning in children. We now have a growing body of evidence that from infancy children distinguish the causal properties relevant to agents and minds and those relevant to phys ical objects (Bloom 2004; Gergely et al. 2003: 287-92). For instance, Ani mates are presumed to be free from the contact principle that requires physical objects to be contacted in order to begin moving (Spelke et al. 1995). Infants expect objects that propel themselves in an apparently purposeful or goal directed fashion to continue to behave in a purposeful fashion even if violating basic expectations of mechanical movement (Gergely et al. 2003: 287-92; Gergely et al. 1995: 165-93; Leslie 1995: 121-149; Premack 1990: 1-16). Importantly, these expectations may be triggered from infancy with stimuli that do not resemble three-dimensional objects (but two-dimensional spots) let alone human beings (Rochat et al. 1997: 537-61; Scholl et al. 2000: 299 308). These findings suggest that reasoning about Animacy and Mentality does not presume later-developing Biology—as spots are unlikely to be construed as Living Things—or perhaps even standard object Physicality. Suggestively Kuhlmeier, Bloom, and Wynn (2004: 95-103) have offered pre liminary experimental evidence suggesting that infants that demonstrate awareness of the continuity principle for Solid Objects (part of the Physicality expectation set) do not demonstrate awareness that human beings must move according to the continuity principle. Together with research demonstrating how readily preschool-aged children reason with disembodied imaginary friends (Taylor 1999), these data hint that Mentality and perhaps even Ani macy expectations may operate without a solid, bounded physical object as the target. For young children, minds do not need physical bodies, a sugges tion captured by the term 'intuitive dualism' (Bloom 2004). Though I find the available data suggestive, I concede that what I am offering amounts to a speculation in need of further, direct empirical support. The proposed expectation sets are not a class-inclusion hierarchy, but the sets are not wholly independent either. Some expectation sets automati cally activate others; to have one active in a conceptual structure is to have another present. If a concept activates Biology, it likewise activates Physicality,</page><page sequence="15">322 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 Spatiality, and Universals. If Physicality is not activated, neither is Biology. To illustrate, the Biology assumption that like begets like (e.g., dogs have puppies and not kittens), is wholly deactivated if Physicality is not assumed. What would it mean (beyond metaphor) for a wisp of vapour to beget? Similarly, what would it mean to have natural internal parts if a thing is not a physical object? (I return to this observation below in discussing ghosts.) Step Two requires ontological categorization. Candidate categories include Persons, Animates, Living Things, Solid Objects, and Spatial Entities. If the item in question does not obviously fall into one or more of these five catego ries (e.g., abstractions, events) do not proceed. Items not falling into one of these five categories cannot be coded in terms of counterintuitiveness using this scheme. As described below, it may be that after apparently counterintui tive concepts are considered, ontological category membership will require revision. Step Three: Code Transfers as Superscript, Capitalized Prefixes, Joined by + if Necessary Once basic kind and ontological category have been determined, it can be determined whether a concept, as used in the communicative context under examination, includes properties from a non-native' set of intuitive expecta tions. As a Solid Object, a rock should (intuitively) only include expectations generated by Spatiality and Object Physics. If the rock is attributed the ability to reproduce, then folk Biology properties have been transferred. It would be represented thus, BROCK with the superscript 'B' representing Biology. Simi larly, a tree that can verbally communicate has had Mentality transferred. It would be coded, MTR£E. A rock that eats passersby and talks would have both Animacy and Mentality transferred. To represent both of these transferred properties, + is used: A+MROCK. Following the Simplicity Rule (that the least counterintuitive or "simplest" representation should be assumed), a TREE that both listens empathetically (a property from Mentality) and verbally communicates (another Mentality property) would still be coded MTREE. The assumption is that the entire set of Mentality expectations have been transferred, not just the one named men tal ability. What would it mean for a tree to be able to talk to you but not think, remember, perceive, and so forth? Unless the concept explicitly renounces other properties from the same set of expectations, we assume the entire set has been transferred.7 7 Lindeman &amp; Aarino (2006: 585-602) identify transferring intuitive expectations from one causal domain to another as the hallmark of "paranormal" thought.</page><page sequence="16">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 323 The Simplicity Principle in conjunction with the non-independence of expectation sets limits the number of transfers each ontological category can have. Re-examining Table One, a member of an ontological category can have transfers limited to only the number of 'NO's listed. Persons (not humans) can have no transfers as they already assume or tolerate all of the sets of expec tations. The specific case of humans illustrates this point. Intuitively humans activate all six expectation sets. In the scheme presented here, however, Per sons can have no transfers. If the preponderance of evidence led cognitive scientists to agree that the category of artefacts' naturally and intuitively gen erates a unique set of expectations and that artefacts cannot be persons, then perhaps persons could have a property transferred. For instance, if artefacts are assumed to be constructed with non-organic materials, then a metal person might be represented as having the transferred property of being composed of metal. As it is, a person made of metal would be a breach of the Biology expec tation for Living Things to be composed of natural, organic materials. Ani mates, however, can have one transfer, namely Mentality. An earthworm that ponders Shakespeare might be an example. On the other end, a Spatial Entity such as a shadow might have three transfers: Physicality, Animacy, and Men tality (e.g., a tangible shadow that eats rats and enjoys poetry). However, the Simplicity Principle would likely drive this thrice-transferred shadow to be represented more simply as an intangible Person—a concept with a single breach. I turn to breaches below. Step Four: Code Breaches as Superscript Lowercase Suffixes, Joined by + if Necessary8 In addition to the transfer of a non-native' property to an object, an object may be counterintuitive by the violation or breach of native expectations. For instance, as a rock is a Solid Object, intuitively we presume that it exemplifies all of the expectations of Universals, Spatiality, and Physicality. A rock that does not satisfy all of these expectations (e.g., an invisible brick) would be counterintuitive by virtue of a breach (of Physicality in the case of an invisible rock).9 An invisible brick would be coded ROCKp. 8 Steps Three and Four may be reversed as there is no necessary priority of transfers over breaches, i thank Joe Henrich for helpful suggestions regarding the formalization of the coding scheme. 9 I suggest capital letters to represent transfers but lowercase for breaches for two reasons. First, such a strategy redundantly discriminates between transfers and breaches. Second, it also symbolizes that, in the case of transfers, the whole expectation set has been transferred, but for breaches only a single expectation from the designated set has been violated.</page><page sequence="17">324 J. L. Barrett I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 Unlike transfers, a breach does not necessarily presume that the entire intu itive expectation set has been violated. When hearing about an invisible rock, people need not presume that it must be intangible as well. Consequently, an invisible rock that can pass through other solid objects could be represented with two Physicality breaches but presume all other Physicality expectations such as being tangible, requiring contact to move, requiring support, and moving as a continuous unit. The invisible rock that can pass through other solid objects would be coded as ROCKp+p. Note, however, that with increas ing breaches of an expectation set, the Simplicity Principle is increasingly likely to find a more parsimonious representation by assuming the entire set is violated and hence, revise the ontological category membership (Step Two). A brick that is intangible, invisible, and need not move as a coherent whole begins to look like something other than a Solid Object, and so it seems unlikely to really be anything we would normally regard as a brick. With that many Physicality violations, I am unsure that any Physicality expectations apply and so rather than code it as a rock with three breaches (ROCKp+p+p), I may intuitively represent it as a substance or cloud that happens to have a brick-like shape with no breaches or transfers (VAPOR) or as a vapor that has rock-like boundaries, a transferred property from Physicality (pVAPOR). As with transfers, multiple breaches from separate intuitive expectation sets would be joined with +. For instance, a rock that is invisible (Physicality breach) and ceases to exist on Wednesdays (Universals breach) would be coded, ROCKptu. Combining Steps Three and Four, we have a method for coding even more complex concepts that include both breaches and transfers. Consider an invis ible chair that eats underpants ACFIAIRP. Or consider a singing rosebush that experiences time backwards MBUSHU. It is possible to conceptualize a transferred property that itself has been breached. For instance, a chair that swallows people only when it is not hun gry,' would likely be understood as an inanimate Solid Object that has been transferred a Biology property (nutritional needs and activity to satisfy those needs) that have been violated (by acting contrary to the Biology assumption). In cases such as this, I suggest using the same coding notation as with any other breach/transfer combination. For instance, with BCHAIRb, the prefix 'B' signifies the transfer of Biology to the chair, and the suffix, lower-case 'b' signi fies a breach of that transferred Biology. Another example might be a statue that can hear your thoughts,' coded as MSTATUEm. The statue has been trans ferred Mentality that has been breached (thoughts are not within the scope of hearing). If necessary, use V to represent multiple breaches of the same trans ferred expectation set. A 'statue that can hear your thoughts and has x-ray vision' could be symbolized as: MSTATUEm+m.</page><page sequence="18">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 325 Step Five: Code Breaches within Breaches Using Parentheses A final way to complicate a concept is to breach a breach. To illustrate: a cow that becomes invisible on Mondays' would have a breach of its Physicality assumptions (visibility) and that breach would break the Universal expecta tion of consistency (properties are continuously applicable). These breaches of breaches always include a violation of Universals. I suggest coding them with parentheses around the breached concept: (COWp)u. If a single breach of multiple breaches is then breached, it may be necessary to enclose just the breached property symbolic letter for the sake of clarity. 'A cow that becomes invisible on Mondays and can pass through walls' would be: COWp+(p)u. Whereas a cow that is invisible and can pass through walls on Mondays' would be: (COWp,p)u. However, A cow that is invisible and can pass through walls but fails to exist on Mondays' would be COWp+p+u. No parentheses are used because the breaches are not being breached. Step Six: Quantify Counterintuitiveness by Totalling the Number of Symbolic Letters The final step in this coding process is to simply count up the superscript let ters employed. A concept that can be represented with nothing more than the basic level, all-caps word, scores zero on counterintuitiveness. Each breach or transfer adds one point. Table Three (see Appendices) gives examples. IV. Illustrative Applications: Ghosts and God How might commonly-held folk concepts be treated under the proposed sys tem? Allow me two examples: ghosts (whether ancestors or spirits), and God. To make these illustrative codings I am relying on my own folk knowledge of these concepts in English-speaking North America to speculate about how a representative individual might privately represent these public representa tions in a single representative episode. I do not regard my knowledge on these matters as authoritative and acknowledge the potential for great individual variation. I only offer these analyses for the sake of illustration and to raise empirical questions. Recall, too, that in actual instances of coding, particular communicative episodes should be considered such as a story about a ghost and not the folk concept 'ghost,' or what a person says about God in conversa tion and neither the entire corpus of God-related folklore or theology, nor the entire semantic scope of 'God.' First, let's deal with ghosts. A complaint frequently raised against the MCI theory as originally formulated has been that some very successful cultural</page><page sequence="19">326 J. L. Barrett I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 concepts appear to be much more than minimally counterintuitive. Ghosts and God arise in this regard. In early versions of the MCI theory it was assumed that the structuring expectation sets were related in a fully nested hierarchy. If an object activated folk Biology, the Physicality and Spatiality likewise applied. If an object was a Person with Mentality, then it likewise activated Animacy, Biology, Physicality, and Spatiality. Consequently, by virtue of having a mind, a ghost had to be classed as a Person (and a HUMAN for its basic level) that had breaches of object physics (intangibility, the ability to pass through solid objects, and to be invisible), and had at least one breach of folk biology (is immortal). Hence, using the present coding scheme, a ghost would have been represented HUMANp+ptp+b and have a counterintuitiveness score of 4 (plus or minus one depending on the particulars of the ghost concept). Clearly such a concept is more than minimally counterintuitive. Similarly, God in the Abrahamic traditions has a mind (and so is a Person) with fully breached Biology, Physicality, and Spatiality expectations along with a smattering of Mentality breaches (e.g., mind reading ability, unre stricted perception, etc.). God might then be represented something like HUMANs+p+p+p+b+b+b+m+mtm and have a counterintuitiveness score of 10 or more. Though the MCI theory never maintained that widespread more-than minimally-counterintuitive concepts were not possible, their existence does demand additional explanation. For instance, Whitehouse has suggested that these more counterintuitive concepts require special cultural supports such as rituals or other transmissive technologies to aid their successful communica tion (2004).10 It might also be that the whole slate of counterintuitive features is not represented in any given on-line context or communicative episode (Barrett et al. 1996: 219-47; Barrett 1999: 325-339). Perhaps cultural scaf folding does help account for widespread belief in many of God's counterin tuitive properties, but what about ghosts? It is not obvious that rituals or study or any other special cultural practices are necessary for a ghost concept to be successfully learned or communicated. Further, if MCI theory cannot account for God or ghosts of various sorts, then it seems to have a very limited utility. Maybe it is fine for explaining elements of folk tales or legends, but then it makes only a small contribution to understanding the kinds of entities in which people actually believe. Under the proposed scheme for operationalizing and coding counterintui tive concepts, these concerns about ghosts and God appear less grave for the MCI theory. The two substantive differences that come to MCI theory's aid 10 McCauley &amp; Lawson previously made a similar point about the need for special cultural scaffolding to support religious rituals that too greatly deviate from intuitive cognitive con straints (2002).</page><page sequence="20">/. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 327 are that expectation sets are non-independent but also non-hierarchical, and the Simplicity Principle. For a spirit/ghost concept these observations mean that ghosts might not actually be intuitively represented as humans with mul tiple Physicality breaches and additional Biology breaches. Rather, because Biology presumes natural intuitive Physicality, multiple Physicality breaches automatically deactivate Biology expectations. Consequently, Biology expec tation breaches need not be represented in the conceptual structure. Perhaps then ghosts are represented as, HUMANP+P+P instead of HUMANp+p+ptb. Because Biology requires Physicality and Physicality has been breached, Biol ogy is not presumed relevant. The counterintuitiveness score of the ghost con cept drops from 4 or more to 3. Further still, the Simplicity Principle suggests that when several breaches from a single expectation set are violated, the human conceptual tendency toward less complex representations will find a different representation that captures the same properties but with fewer violations of intuitive expecta tions. It could be, then, that the three proposed breaches of Physicality (invis ibility, intangibility, and being able to pass through solid objects in violation of Solidity) disqualify the ghost as a Solid Object outright. Perhaps ghosts and spirits are represented as Spatial Entities with transferred Mentality. Indeed, the idea of a ghost or spirit being the formless, shapeless agency of a human that is recurrent in ethnography and comparative religion, suggests that spa tial-entity-with-mentality is true to how people represent ghosts and spirits. For lack of a better basic level label, I use SUBSTANCE for the non-specified Spatial Entities. In the coding scheme presented, a ghost might be, "^SUB STANCE. Because Mentality presumes Animacy (to purposefully act in or on the environment), coding the transfer of Animacy is unnecessary. The coun terintuitiveness score for ghost/spirit is then 1; the epitome of a minimally counterintuitive concept. In different cultural contexts, however, especially where ghosts motivate rituals and other collective behaviours because they are part of the local religious system, ghosts may have additional counterintuitive features joined to them. The prediction is that concepts with a counterintui tiveness score of more than 2 would likely require additional cultural scaffold ing (e.g., recurrent formalized teaching on the matter, development of theology, rituals, etc.) to successfully transmit the concept. Even still, it may be that in a single on-line episode or communicative act (e.g., a single story), only one or two counterintuitive features would be represented (Barrett 1999: 325-339). If, as suggested in the discussion of "intuitive dualism" above, Animacy and Mentality do not presume object Physicality but only require a location that can change or a spatial form that can otherwise act, a ghost is not a Solid Object that has breaches of Physicality but, instead, a bodiless Person.</page><page sequence="21">328 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 Therefore, it is not counterintuitive, as Mentality does not assume Physicality. This could be represented as MIND and have a counterintuitiveness score of 0 before any further elaboration. Perhaps the only counterintuitive property concerns a non-physical entity being able to manipulate Solid Objects, but this would be counterintuitive efficacy and not necessarily a property intrinsic to the ghost concept. But what about the Abrahamic God (especially as represented in real-time by non-specialists)? Similar to ghosts, it may be inappropriate to think that God is represented as a human with numerous breaches, but rather as Mental ity in the form of a Spatial Entity, or more simply still as disembodied Mental ity. As a Person, Biology and Physicality are not activated, but Mentality, Animacy, and Spatiality are. Hence, a disembodied mentality might be repre sented MIND. What a folk God concept commonly adds to this representa tion is breaches of the transferred Mentality (e.g. being able to hear or see anything, being able to read minds), MINDm+m. Note, however, that if God is represented as omnipresent (a breach of Spatiality), then being able to hear or see anything is not a breach of Mentality. The omnipresent God may be rep resented with only a single breach of Mentality (mind reading), and a breach of Spatiality. The resulting coding would yield a counterintuitiveness score of 2 and look like this: MIND""1. If, on the other hand, God is not commonly (intuitively) represented as omnipresent, but is conceptualized as having a sin gle location (Barrett 1998: 608-619; Barrett et al. 1996: 219-47; Barrett &amp; VanOrman 1996: 38-45) that is well-distributed (such as an enormous cloud or unbounded substance), then perhaps God is better coded, MINDm. I have not yet discussed another common divine attribute, omniscience, because its status in terms of counterintuitiveness is unclear. Simulating what it would mean to know everything is beyond human capacity and hence cre ates the impression that the notion of an all-knowing being is counterintui tive. If it is impossible to understand, I suspect that people do not actually include 'omniscience' in their folk notion of God but something more func tional such as 'knowing anything of which I can think.' We might, after Boy er's "full-access agents" (2001), call this alternative representation a full informational access God. Is a full informational access mind counterintuitive? The answer is unclear. Developmental evidence suggests that before around age four, children do not understand the limits on human knowledge (Barrett et al. 2003: 91-108; Wellman et al. 2001: 655-84). Indeed, even in adulthood tracking who-might-know-what is a difficult and imprecise calculation. A much simpler calculation is what two- and three-year-olds do: assume that minds know anything known. It could be that the default expectation about Mentality is full informational access; hence, such minds are intuitive. Learn ing just which minds are likely to have access to what kind of information</page><page sequence="22">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 329 may constitute practiced naturalness instead of maturational naturalness. Another alternative is that the Mentality expectation set has nothing in par ticular to say about how much or how little a person can and does know. If either of these alternatives is right, then perhaps God (as privately represented by individuals) is not terribly counterintuitive after all. These are, however, empirical questions. V. Summary: Clarifications, Predictions, and Conclusion To summarize, in identifying concepts' relative counterintuitiveness in any given communicative context, I propose a six-step system for coding and scor ing. Starting with the Simplicity Principle, which states that human cognitive systems generally strive for representational and computational efficiency and simplicity, I have derived the Simplicity Rule and then suggested six steps for coding and quantifying concepts in terms of their counterintuitive features and total degree of counterintuitiveness. Table Four lists these steps. A primary aim of specifying this six-step process is to clarify what does and does not count as counterintuitive' in its technical sense; thus, disambiguat ing experimental evidence that is and is not relevant to falsifying the cognitive optimum or MCI theory. To illustrate, in Upal et al. (2007: 415-439), Exper iment 2B appears to yield mixed support for the MCI theory. Upal et al. pre sented participants with a mix of intuitive and counterintuitive concepts embedded in two stories, dubbed "Adventures of Mr. Wurg" and the other "The Journey Home." The between-subjects manipulation was a modified introduction of the stories to lead participants to expect counterintuitive con cepts versus intuitive ones. In the condition intended to create the expectation of counterintuitive concepts in the stories, participants continued to recall counterintuitive concepts significantly more than intuitive ones in "The Jour ney Home" story (consistent with the MCI theory) but not in "Adventures of Mr. Wurg." The authors speculate that "This may mean that the counterintui tive concepts we embedded in that story were not as counterintuitive' as those used by Barrett and Nyhof (2001) and Boyer and Ramble (2001)" (2007: 432). Applying the coding steps suggested above could help address Upal et al. s speculation. Clarifications: Counterintuitiveness is not Inferential Potential One modification to the MCI theory from its earlier form (Boyer 1994) has been the addition of Inferential Potential (Boyer 2001). Inferential Poten tial refers to the ability for a concept or idea to readily generate explanations,</page><page sequence="23">330 J. L. Barrett I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 predictions, and other inferences in a broad range of personally relevant con texts. Boyer notes that not all MCI ideas hold the same inferential potential. The relative degree of inferential potential modulates the general prediction that MCI concepts are more readily remembered and communicated than other concepts. People would have less motivation to remember a MCI idea with low inferential potential. Consider a stop sign that eats cars. This sets the imagination racing, doesn't it? Compare this to an intangible stop sign. Or, compare an invisible rock (weak inferential potential) to a rock that listens to you (stronger inferential potential). A rock that listens more readily generates predictions, explanations, and other inferences in a broad range of contexts than the invisible rock. If a rock can listen to me, what does it know about me? What does it know about others? Can it act on that information? Can it share what it knows? An invisible rock is hard to find and although it may be a trip ping hazard, not much else follows beyond what might follow from learning about an ordinary rock. We might also distinguish between reflective or off-line inferential potential and non-reflective or on-line inferential potential. It may be that an idea with great inferential potential in off-line processing (e.g., relativity theory for a physicist in the lab) may have rather poor on-line inferential potential (e.g., relativity theory for a physicist driving in rush hour traffic). Research on the use of God concepts in real time suggests that while arguably holding tremen dous off-line inferential potential, their on-line inferential potential is poor enough to be temporarily discarded for more anthropomorphic and less theo logically correct versions (Barrett 1998: 608-619; Barrett 1999: 325-339; Bar rett &amp; Keil 1996: 219-47; Barrett et al. 1996: 38-45). That inferential potential and counterintuitiveness are different does not entail that they are unrelated. Concepts with high counterintuitiveness scores are likely to be too conceptually cumbersome to be useful in real time. Hence, we would expect on-line inferential potential to drop precipitously in con cepts with several counterintuitive features. Perhaps counterintuitiveness and inferential potential are inversely related, or it could be that inferential poten tial first increases with modest counterintuitiveness and then plummets. Without relevant data, we can only speculate. Predictions One aim of this paper was to clarify the predictions of a MCI theory defensi ble in terms of current thought regarding early-developing pan-human con ceptual systems. Using the proposed coding scheme and re-analysis of the MCI theory, I can make a number of preliminary predictions. Only the first is</page><page sequence="24">J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 331 critical for the general utility of the theory. If the first can be demonstrated to be false, the MCI theory must be amended or rejected. I offer the subsequent predictions to illustrate ways in which the theory could be further developed and made useful. I hope it is clear that the version of the MCI theory presented here does not apply to concepts falling outside of the intuitive ontological categories presented. (1) First, following Boyer, I predict that MCI concepts, that is, ideas with a score of 1 for counterintuitiveness, are more readily remembered and com municated faithfully than other concepts (all else being equal). For example, a book that thinks would be better remembered and communicated than a book about thought or a book that thinks and has babies. (2) More than two breaches from the same expectation set will tend to get re-represented in a simpler (i.e., less counterintuitive) form. (3) A single transferred property from an expectation set will tend to prompt the assumption that the entire set of properties is transferred. (4) A concept with a score higher than three will be unlikely to possess on line inferential potential and will be discarded in favour of a simpler form. A cut-off score of three is derived from an analysis of the counterintuitiveness of folktales from Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, and Native America (Barrett 1997), and Lisdorf's analysis (2001) of Roman prodigies from the first and second centuries B.C.E. Both projects found essentially no counterintuitive concepts with more than two counterintuitive features (at least in a single nar rative context). For the same reason, I offer a related prediction that on-line inferential potential peaks with a counterintuitiveness score of 1 or 2 and then drops with increasing counterintuitiveness. Boyer's theory and my re-formulation make no distinction in terms of pro cessing burden or mnemonic advantage for ideas that are counterintuitive by virtue of a breach versus counterintuitive by virtue of a transfer. Nevertheless, such differences might be subjected to empirical investigation. Conclusion In sum, for the MCI theory to be fruitful in the study of cognition and culture and to be rigorously tested and either modified or rejected based on that testing, more precision and uniformity is needed regarding the scope and pre dictions of the theory. I hope that the presented sketch of the theoretical grounds for the theory and the introduction of a formal coding and quantifi cation scheme contribute to this need for precision and uniformity. Using the</page><page sequence="25">332 J. L. Barrett / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 20 (2008) 308-338 presented coding scheme, researchers might be better able to identify public representations for concepts likely to be privately represented as counterintui tive. Further, this scheme could be used as a tool to develop experimental stimuli that different scholars in the field recognize as relevant to testing pre dictions of the theory.

'YES' indicates that an ontological category (listed across the top) intu itively assumes a particular expectation set (listed in the left-hand column). 'NO' indicates that an ontological category does not allow a particular expectation set. '—' indicates that the ontological category does not intuitively assume or disallow an expectation set but may intuitively include members that do or do not activate the expectation set. c It may be that minds are intuitively represented as having Spatiality without Physicality, more akin to an unbounded substance, and are intuitively separable from physical bodies as suggested by Bloom (2004). If so, a disembodied mind is a Person and Persons need not automatically activate Physicality. Such a finding would have implications for the discussion of ghost and God concepts toward the end of this paper. A disembodied mind in a particular location would not, by itself, be counterintuitive.

Step 1 Identify the basic level membership. (Revision of identification may be required by the Simplicity Rule after considering Steps 3-6.) Step 2 Identify the ontological category or categories. Candidate categories include Persons, Animates, Living Things, Solid Objects, and Spatial Entities. If the item in question does not obviously fall into one or more of these five categories (e.g., abstractions, events) do not proceed. (Revision of categorization may be required by the Simplicity Rule after considering Steps 3-6.) Step 3 Code transfers as superscript prefixes with capital letters, joined by + if necessary. Step 4 Code breaches as superscript suffixes with lowercase letters, joined by + if necessary. Code breaches within breaches with parentheses. Quantify counterintuitiveness by totalling the number of symbolic letters.</page></plain_text>
