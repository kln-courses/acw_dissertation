<plain_text><page sequence="1">"CHANTING THE SQUARE DEIFIC"- A STUDY IN WHITMAN'S RELIGION GEORGE L. SIXBEY University of Maryland THE CRITICISMS of Whitman's "Chanting the Square Deific" by theologians range in effect from cries of "blas- phemy!'' and "heresy!" to rapt appreciation and rhapsodic exten- sions of some aspects of the poet's ideas. Literary critics have, on the whole, been mildly contemptuous of Whitman's theology and the peculiar language in which he set it forth. Although Whit- man offered no apology for his barbaric "yawp," he did anticipate the objections to his theology: The ripeness of Religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of individuality, and is a result that no organization or church can ever achieve. As history is poorly retain'd by what the technists call history, and is not given out from their pages, except the learner has in himself the sense of the well-wrapt, never yet written, perhaps impossible to be written history-so Religion, although casually arrested, and, after a fashion, preserv'd in the churches and creeds, does not depend at all upon them, but is a part of the identified soul, which, when greatest, knows not bibles in the old ways, but in new ways-the identified soul, which can really confront Religion when it extricates itself entirely from the churches, and not before. The purpose of this article is to enquire into the ideas expressed in "Chanting the Square Deific"; to discover their origin and de- Cf.

"Chanting the Square Deific" was first published in a twenty- four-page booklet bearing on the title-page: "Sequel to Drum-Taps. (Since the preceding came from the press.) WHEN LILACS LAST IN THE DOOR-YARD BLOOM'D). And other pieces. Washing- ton, 1865-6." The whole volume, including the title-page and table of contents, was immediately appended to the volume of war poems which had recently appeared in New York under the title of Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps. These in turn found their way into Leaves of Grass in 1867, appended with their own sepa- rate title-pages, tables of contents, and pagination, to the Fourth Edition, published in New York. Contrary to his expectations, Whitman's poems on the war and on the death of Lincoln appar- ently found little more immediate popularity than had the earlier editions of Leaves of Grass. Yet among the eighteen pieces in- cluded in the Sequel to Drum-Taps are several which have become almost universally known and admired. As he hurried this little volume through the press in Washington, possibly even before Drum-Taps had appeared in New York, it seems likely that Whit- man attached some special importance to the poems it contained. The war poems, of course, were timely; even more timely were the elegies upon Lincoln, whose death caused Whitman strong poign- ant grief. "Chanting the Square Deific" merits its place in the volume as a hymn to a new god constituted to console the nation, war-torn and bereft; moreover, it belongs with "Reconciliation" as a war poem addressed especially to the South. In a note proposing a poem on the Crusades, Whitman had said: "Put in this point strong, that the great redeeming movements, rebellions of the world have been those-(Such as the Crusades &amp; our own great war)-which have been mainly for an idea." And in the stanza on Satan, he deified the spirit of rebelliousness which had prompted the shelling of Fort Sumter. ~In a letter to his mother, dated April xo, x864, Whitman wrote: "I want to come on in a month and try to print my 'Drum-Taps'. I think it may be a success pecuniarily, too" (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed., The Wound Dresser, Boston, I898, p. x64). ?Charles I. Glicksberg (ed.), Walt Whitman and the Civil War (Philadelphia, I933), p. I6I. Note that the "redeeming movements" come from rebellions, and not from sup- pressing rebellions.

Moreover, he was satisfied with "Chanting the Square Deific," at least, both as to its content and its workmanship. After its first publication, the poem received no marked revision, such as many of his poems were subjected to. Compared with sixteen minor changes in "When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloom'd," a some- what longer poem, and three changes in "O Captain! My Cap- tain!" there is but a single alteration of "Chanting the Square Deific" as it first appeared. In 1870, Whitman added the single word old to modify time in line 5. Perhaps some of his satisfaction with the content of the poem can be attributed to its subjectivity. As a poet, Whitman was com- pelled to make God in his own image. In 1855, he had boasted: Magnifying and applying come I, Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, The most they offer for mankind and eternity less than a spirit of my own seminal wet, Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah and laying them away, Lithographing Kronos and Zeus his son, and Her- cules his grandson, Buying drafts of Osiris and Isis and Belus and Brahma and Adonai, In my portfolio placing Manito loose, and Allah on a leaf, and the crucifix engraved, With Odin, and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and all idols and images; Honestly taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent more, 7 It is interesting to conjecture whether the plan for a separate volume of poems al- ready begun may have been in Whitman's mind as early as the spring of x863, when he wrote in a letter from Washington: "Mother, when you or left writes again, tell me if my papers and MSS. are all right; I should be very sorry indeed if they got scattered, or used up or anything---especially the copy of 'Leaves of Grass' covered in blue paper, and the little MS. book 'Drum Taps,' and the MS. tied up in the square, spotted (stone- paper) loose covers~I want them all carefully kept" (The Wound Dresser, p. 6x). If so, its publication was undoubtedly hastened by the death of Lincoln and the composition of the elegies upon him. 8,,The Square is not Deity, because we can predicate nothing about God. It is Deific, or God-making, because we are compelled to make God in our image" (Symonds, op. cit., p. 23).</page><page sequence="4">174 American Literature Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days; Admitting they bore mites as for unfledged birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for them- selves; Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself . . . . bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see . . . . And now, ten years later, he identifies himself with each of the four sides of his quaternity in turn: "From this side Jehovah am I . . .

Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, I, the gen- eral soul . . . . ,, "Chanting the Square Deific," then, may be regarded as another "Song of Myself," because Whitman's God, like his religion, was mystical, and hence had to be conceived sub- jectively. Many of the ideas and images in the poem appear to be revisions and adaptations of material from earlier poems and from the poet's notebooks. Although not all the material has been defi- nitely dated, the development of the ideas in the poem can be traced with some accuracy through the notebooks, published prose, and other poetic works. In addition to the sources for specific passages, which will be presented later, the following passages are of interest as general sources for the poem: ?Spinal idea of a "lesson." Founding of a new American religion (?No religion). That which is comprehensive enough to include all doctrines and sects and give them all places and chances, each after its kind.

Hebrew-the most etherial and elevated spiritually-this seems to be what subordinates all the rest-The Soul, the spirit rising in vague- ness. Although the "spirit rising in vagueness" apparently does not emerge again until it becomes Santa Spirita, Whitman's idea of comprehensiveness and the Greek ideas of Love and Esthetic are recognizable, along with the Satan of the Square Deific, in the fol- lowing passage in "Pictures," which Holloway believes to have been written in 1853, and to contain materials adapted in "Chant- ing the Square Deific": And this black portrait-this head, huge, frowning, sorrowful,- it is Lucifer's portrait-the denied God's portrait, (But I do not deny him-though cast out and rebellious, he is my God as much as any;) And again the heads of three other Gods-the God Beauty, the God Beneficence, and the God Universality, (they also are mine) . . . . Here, at least, are four deities accepted, some of whom are expanded in the later poem; but in his comment that these may have fur- nished the idea for the quaternity, Holloway overlooks the "por- trait'' of Christ in an earlier passage in the same poem, which is quoted later in this article in the discussion of the second stanza.

Again, Whitman jotted: "Religions-Gods. Supposed to be one thousand religions. Names of Gods, sects, and prophets..." and concluded with nearly a page and a half (in type) of names. Like Milton, he must have had a deep interest in comparative re- ligion; but unlike Milton, who contented himself with ascribing to pagan deities a heavenly origin, he identified selected pagan gods with the Godhead. Of the twelve hierarchs named in "Chanting the Square Deific," only four (and these not entirely "regular") do not appear on this list: Time, Earth, Father, and Santa Spirita. What rare restraint he exhibited in refraining from making "Chanting the Square Deific" a catalogue of the whole page and a half of Gods, sects, and prophets named in his notes! Whitman was well aware of the problem involved in com- pounding thus heterogeneous materials to form a religion or God- head "comprehensive enough to include all doctrines and sects." It is the problem confronting those who today would unite all the denominations of Protestantism; but it is amplified by the inclusion of all other sects and religions as well. Yet such compounding of materials from many centuries and from many lands was essential z~ MS Notebook VI (x86o-x86I ?), in the collection of the Library of Congress; cf.

In 1857, viewing Leaves of Grass as a "New Bible," he wrote: "Leading characteristics. To unite all sects, parties, States . . . . ,, And in a passage headed "Philosophy of Leaves of Grass" which Bucke believed to be a note for a friendly reviewer, Whitman said: Walt Whitman's philosophy-or perhaps metaphysics, to give it a more definite name-as evinced in his poems, and running through them, and sometimes quite palpable in his verses, but far oftener latent, and like the unseen roots or sap of trees-is not the least of his peculi- arities-one must not say originalities, for Whitman himself disclaims originality-at least in the superficial sense. His notion explicitly is that there is nothing actually new only an accumulation or fruitage or car- rying out those new occasions and requirements . . . . In old age Whitman recorded something of the method by which he had accumulated the fruitage for his requirements: Later, at intervals, summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island's sea- shores-there, in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thor- oughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb'd (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room-it makes such a difference where you read,) Shakspere, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German "Nibelungen," the ancient Hindoo poems, and one or two other master- pieces, Dante's among them. Among the "other masterpieces" which contributed to "Chanting the Square Deific" were Bailey's Festus, Byron's Manfred, Milton's Paradise Lost, and Goethe's Faust. In a highly favorable series of criticisms, dated January, 1856; 18 Feb., 1856; and 26 Feb. [un- doubtedly the same year], Whitman recorded what was apparently a rather extensive reading of Goethe. His solution of the philo- sophic problem raised in the poem also shows the influence of Hegel, whom he may have understood only imperfectly, but who XTAmerican Art Association, op. cit., p. 27.

To approximate Hegel's Absolute Idea, Whitman synchronized and embodied in himself many creeds and theologies. In 1855, he had declared: My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths, Enclosing all worship ancient and modern, and all between ancient and modern, Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years, Waiting responses from oracles . . . . honoring the gods . . . . saluting the sun, Making a fetish of the first rock or stump . . . . powow- lng with sticks in the circle of obis, Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols, Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession . . . . rapt and austere in the woods, a gymnosophist, Drinking mead from the skull-cup . . . . to shasta and vedas admirant . . . . minding the koran, Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from stone and knife-beating the serpent-skin drum; Accepting the gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, To the mass kneeling-to the puritan's prayer rising-sitting patiently in a pew, I agree with Boatright that "Whitman was in no technical sense a philosopher, but that he did look at life from one habitual point of view, and this point of view, in the main, is in accord with the Absolute Idealism of Hegel" (Mody C. Boatright, "Whitman and Hegel," Univ. of Texas Studies in English, No. 9, July 8, 1929, p. 134). I do not feel, however, that Boatright's exposition of the Hegelianism in "Chanting the Square Deific" is adequate, especially with regard to Satan and the Santa Spirita. He says: "I think, however, that it does not require a great deal of fancy to see in the poem a reflection of Hegelian dialectic. Law, i. e., necessity (described in the first stanza), is set against its antithesis, Mercy (described in the second stanza). The synthesis gives Good (not directly described in the poem), which is set against its antithesis, Evil; the new synthesis yielding God, the pervader and encloser of all life, and the correspondent of Hegel's Absolute Idea" (p. 143). Whitman's debt to Hegel, as well as the function of the Santa Spirita, seems also to be suggested in the following passage: "He [Whitman] accepts Darwinism as an advance, but is unwilling to admit that it finally answers the question of origins or destinies. The most satisfactory answer thus far made, he thinks, is Hegel's theory of the cosmic con- sciousness advancing through conflict and contradiction towards some purposed objective; but Hegel, like Darwin, is cold and intellectual, whereas Whitman demands the warmth and exaltation of the ancient prophets" (Stovall, op. cit., pp. xlviii-xlix).

By 1860, he felt that his apprenticeship to the past had been served, and that the experience had not fallen short of his expectations. Then he sang: I conn'd old times, I sat studying at the feet of the great masters; Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might return and study me! and again: I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true without exception. He accepted the notion that religions rooted in widely divergent cultures have in them universal truths; therefore he framed his quaternity to include the qualities and names of foreign and pagan deities. He remained steadfast in this belief throughout his life. Writing on "Poetry of the Future," he said: I see that this world of the West, as part of all, fuses inseparably with the East, and with all, as time does-the ever new, yet old, old human race-"the same subject continued," as the novels of our grandfathers had it for chapter-heads. If we are not to hospitably receive and complete the inaugurations of the old civilizations, and change their small scale to the largest, broadest scale, what on earth are we for? Thus was "Chanting the Square Deific" compounded. The choice of a title was likewise a matter requiring thought and special investigation. For so comprehensive a poem, no ordi- nary title would suffice. Hence, Whitman first turned to the Latin, probably because it is the conventional vehicle for Christian theol- ogy. On the back cover of a notebook containing some of the sources for this poem is the memorandum: "I want a Latin motto which conveys the following sense of the words 'Four in One.'" =Leaves 0855), p. 48; "Song of Myself," 11.

The word Song he used frequently in titles; Chanting, with its ecclesiastical connotations, is peculiarly appropriate to the subject of this poem. The sense of Deific has already been touched upon. The Square seems to have been an especially happy image to represent the idea of "Four in One." Had Whitman only been familiar with the fol- lowing prayer of the Pythagoreans, whose deity was also "divine four-foldness" representing the four elements-fire, water, air, and earth,-he might have satisfied his desire for a learned word with the Greek tetraktys: Bless us, divine number, thou who generatest gods and men! O holy, holy tetraktys, thou that containest the root and source of the eternally flowing creation! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-comprising, all abounding, the first-born, the never-swerving, the never-tiring holy ten, the key-holder of all. As the reader knows, "Chanting the Square Deific" is composed of four stanzas, each of which describes one side of the quaternity and suggests its function. The organization of the poem is similar to that of both the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds, in which each suc- cessive paragraph treats the qualities of one of the persons of the Trinity. The first side of the Square Deific to emerge is law-relentless MS Notebook VI (x86o-x86x?), in Library of Congress, Whitman's method of experi- menting with language is shown by the following words, jotted on successive lines of the first page of the same notebook: "Quatuor, Quatruna, Quadriene, Quatruna," and "Quaterniune" at the bottom of the fifth page.

It is primarily natural law, which governs gravity, the ebb and flow of tides, daybreak and evening, the succession of seasons-all the uncontrollable regularity in nature. To explore such forces in nature and to explain them as law was one of the earliest functions of primitive religions. Did not the medicine-man and witch-doctor sustain their positions largely through their knowledge and interpretation of natural law as deity? In more sophisticated times, natural and moral law were easily combined into a single "divine" code. Whitman had recognized this in 1855. The law of the past cannot be eluded, The law of the present and future cannot be eluded, The law of the living cannot be eluded . . . . it is eternal, The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded, The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded, The law of drunkards and informers and mean persons cannot be eluded. With this conception of God as law, Whitman associates seven names. The first, Jehovah, is readily recognized as the Old Testa- ment Creator, Mosaic code-giver, and god of battle of the Hebrew tribes. The second, Brahm, appears in Whitman's list of gods under that name and also as "Brahma, to create." Brahm, the first person in the Hindoo Trimurti, is commonly personified as Brahma, a masculine creator of the world. This world which he. creates, however, is given but 2,160,000,000 years to endure; then it is ruthlessly destroyed, only to be re-created after a like period has elapsed. Saturnius, the third name in the stanza, is the Italic ruler of the Golden Age (with whom Whitman may have associated the Roman code), and also the god of agriculture-harvest and seed- time. He is usually identified with the Greek Kronos, the seventh name in the stanza. According to the myth, Kronos was a Titan, son of Uranus and Gaea (the Earth Mother), who drove his father from the throne and was himself later dethroned by his son Zeus. In later days his name became confused with "Chronos"; hence he has been erroneously regarded as a god of time. Whitman's list ~Leaves (I855), p. 68; "To Think of Time," 11. 81-86.

The inclusion of Time and the Earth among the hierarchs mak- ing up the first side of the Godhead is significant. In spite of the rejection of time and space by both Carlyle and Emerson, Whitman in this case accepted, and here deified them. "I know I have the best of time and space-and that I was never measured, and never will be measured," he had asserted. "Of all the plenty [in nature] there is, no plenty is comparable to the plenty of time and space.-Of these there is ample store,-there is no limit.'' Time and space, then, become part of natural law, which operates in them and is of them. Confronted with the problem of finding names to designate these new gods, Whitman may have hoped for association alone to call up the image of Father Time with his beard and scythe in his reference to Time. For space there seems to be no traditional nor literary symbol. The following jotting may suggest a step in the process of choosing Earth as the symbol for space: Space considered with reference to the earth, as all parts of the universe bear reference to each other, and all other things therefore bear down their influence more or less upon this earth . . . . The air . . . . the sea . . . . the land . . . . The sixth name in the stanza is Father, whom Whitman un- doubtedly meant to be "God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth," of the Christian creeds. The concept, less prim- itive than that of Jehovah, includes in the Creator the strong mas- culinity of Jehovah, combined perhaps with a greater degree of calm, like that of the Brahma. The seventh name, Kronos, has already been touched upon. Of these seven hierarchs, only Time and the Earth are not established masculine deities. All are them- selves creators, or gods or agriculture and the procreation of life. All seven embody laws of nature. 8~ Ibid., p. ~ 54. ~?=Leaves (x855), p. 5I; "Song of Myself," 1. x2o~. Cf.

These are Christ, Hermes, and Hercules. From the following note, however, it may be gathered that he considered a fourth, whose characteristics and functions he has divided among several sides of the quaternity: Sybilline verses among the ancients always looking for a great mediator, a judge, god, lover, legislator, friend of the poor and degraded, conqueror of powers. Krishna (?thence Christ.) Whitman had not yet explicitly assigned the traits of the Consolator to Christ when he sketched the following images of Christ the teacher, and Christ the crucified in "Pictures": And here the divine Christ expounds eternal truths- expounds the soul, And here he appears en-route to Calvary, bearing the cross-See you, the blood and sweat streaming down his face, his neck. By 1860, however, in the lyrical "To Him That Was Crucified," the Consolator was clearly emerging. Then was Whitman able to identify his own spirit with that of Christ. Together they labor for a common cause; they include in themselves all continents, castes, and creeds; they are "compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men"; and above all, they are brothers and lovers. The second side of the Square Deific, then, expresses the Love which, as has already been shown, Whitman believed to have been at the heart of the Greek religion. Here is the God Beneficence, sketched in "Pic- tures''; here is brotherly affection for rich and poor alike, counter- acting and compensating the relentless forces of nature. Here, in a word, is the lover of the Calamus poems-the friend with hands outstretched to all. Here is Whitman himself, speaking the closing lines of his "Poem of the Road" in the strong, rich tones which brought assurance and sympathy to thousands of sick, wounded, and dying American boys in crowded army hospitals during the war between his beloved States: Mon enfant!

Like Christ, the Good Shepherd, Hermes is associated with the protec- tion of cattle and sheep, and in Tanagra is given the title "ram- bearer."

But Whitman's chief reason for including Hermes in the "cheer-bringing God" is indicated in his comment on the name in his list of gods: "(Mercury) Hermes, the God of Science.'' For Science, Whitman believed, was one of the sure roads to progress, Democracy, and perfection: I say there must, for future and democratic purposes, appear poets ... not only possess'd of the religious fire and abandon of Isaiah, lux- uriant in the epic talent of Homer, or for proud characters as in Shakspere, but consistent with the Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science. America needs, and the world needs, a class of bards who will, now and ever, so link and tally the rational physical being of man with the ensembles of time and space, and with this vast and multiform show, Nature, surrounding him, ever tantalizing him, equally a part, and yet not a part of him, as to essentially harmonize, satisfy, and put at rest. Faith, very old, now scared away by science, must be restored, brought back by the same power that caused her departure-restored with new sway, deeper, wider, higher than ever. The Consolator is also pictured coming with "Hercules' face, all sorrow, labor, suffering . . . . " The function of the second side of the Square Deific calls for all the youth and strength of the demi-god accomplishing the twelve labors recounted in the myth. The last two of his tasks involve visits to the other-world. Rose believes that "there is little doubt that they represent a forcible seizure of immortality.''

So is Hercules, with Hermes and Christ, Consolator. In the third stanza, opposing on the one hand the rigid patterns of natural law and conventional morality, and opposing on the other hand the universal affection of the "cheer-bringing God," comes the spirit of revolt-Satan. The inclusion of this person in the Godhead represents not a momentary whim, but years of serious pondering on the problems of sin and revolt, out of which Whitman had evolved a deep-seated conviction. In one of his early notebooks, he had written: I am the poet of sin, For I do not believe in sin In the silence and darkness Among murderers and cannibals and traders in slaves Stepped my spirit with light feet, and pried away their heads and made fissures to look through And there saw folded foetuses of twins Mute with bent necks waiting to be born- And one was sympathy and one was truth. In 1860 he had declared: I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races, I advance from people en-masse in their own spirit; Here is what sings unrestricted faith. Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may, I make the poem of evil also-I commemorate that part also, I am myself as much evil as good-And ! say there is in fact no evil, Or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the earth, or to me, as anything else. And on the necessity for sin he had planned a poem: "Poem. There can be no greatest and sublimest character without having passed through sin.'' But the Satan of the quaternity is not simply evil or the conven- tional Devil.

On the other hand, rebellion and revolt are, in a sense, positive. The literary sources for his Satan are indicated in the following note: "Theories of Evil-Festus, Faust, Manfred, Paradise Lost, Book of Job.'' In his list of gods, Whitman named not only Satan, but also "Lucifer" and "Typhon, made up of all that opposes, hinders, ob- structs, revolts,'' although the latter two are not mentioned in "Chanting the Square Deific." These materials, and probably others, he compounded with his own thinking to carry out his di- rection to himself, recorded by Bucke among the jottings and plans for poems to be written: "Poem of the Devil-counteractive of the common idea of Satan.'' The text of the stanza was undoubtedly begun long before that of any other part of the poem. As he labored with the ideas of a "Devil-counteractive of the common idea of Satan," Whitman included in several earlier poems germ passages for "Chanting the Square Deific." What is probably his first effort on the subject remains a fragment: I am a Curse: Sharper than the serpent's eyes or wind of the ice-fields! O topple down Curse! topple more heavy than death! I am lurid with rage! I invoke Revenge to assist me- A passage on the deity of revolt, which Holloway believes may antedate the portrait of Lucifer in "Pictures" quoted earlier in this article, is likewise preserved as a fragment: I am a hell-name and a curse: Black Lucifer was not dead; Or if he was I am his sorrowful, terrible heir; I am the God of revolt-deathless, sorrowful, vast; whoever opposes me I will either destroy him or he shall release me. 47 "Earliest and Most Important Note Book"; cf.

I am oppress'd . . . . I hate him that oppresses me, I will either destroy him or he shall release me. Damn him! how he does defile me, How he informs against my brother and sister and takes pay for their blood, How he laughs when I look down the bend after the steam- boat that carries away my woman. In this passage, Lucifer's heir, the God of revolt, seems to be a rebellious slave. To Whitman, as to many in the North before the Civil War, there was an essence of divinity in the negro bondsman rising against the injustice of his lot, even though he displayed, as in this passage, something of the vindictive wrath of the conven- tional Satan. The rebellious one in the Square Deificis like the Satan of the earlier books of Paradise Lost in craftiness, pride, and essence of divinity; he differs from Milton's Satan primarily in that "it was thought I was baffled and dispelled, and my wiles done, but that will never be.'' He is also like both the incarnate Christ of orthodox belief and the Consolator of Whitman's quaternity in that he is "Comrade of criminals, brother of slaves"; but rather to plot with them new rebellion than to console them. This con- cept of the divine quality of rebellion is reminiscent of Milton's ac- count of the heavenly origin of sin ; in effect, both tend to resolve the paradox of evil in a universe governed by an omnipotent and benevolent deity. Although Whitman had very early recognized the worth of rebelliousness, the Civil War, the defeat of the Confederacy, and the arrogance of some of the spokesmen for the victorious States =Leaves (1855), p. 74; "The Sleepers," I1.

Noah Webster accounts for his supporting a like belief in a letter published by Harry R. Warfel in Noah Webster: Schoolmaster to America (New York, x936), p. 255.</page><page sequence="18">188 American Literature combined to crystallize his thinking on the subject. Early in the 1850's he had been perturbed by the threatened "ossification of the spirit" of the nation: "Give us turbulence," he wrote, "give us excitement, give us the rage and disputes of hell-all this rather than this lethargy of death that spreads like a vapor of decay in corpses . . . . ,, Irked by endless compromises which served only to delay the time when "these States" should face the issue inevi- tably before them, in 1860 he cried: Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace-I hold up agitation and conflict. He was sure that What will be will be well, for what is is well. And so, even as the States were feverishly marshaling their forces for the struggle, Whitman's optimism led him to declare the neces- sity of revolt: To The States, or any one of them, or any city of The States, Resist much, obey little, Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved, Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth ever afterward resumes its liberty. Then came the conflict, and Whitman breathed the air of war's exhilaration and of war's horror as he walked between the rows of hospital beds or visited the front in his ro1e as Consolator. Even in defeat, he saw the divine glow of the spirit of rebellion: What Lucifer [felt] cursed when tumbling from Heaven What the rebel felt gaily adjusting his neck to the rope noose, What the savage lashed to the stump, but yelling still his laughter at every foe What rage of hell urged the lips and hands of the victors.- How fared the young captain pale and fiat on his own bloody deck MS Notebook (I85o-I8557) in Library of Congress.

And after Lee's surrender at Appomattox, as the demands for punishment rang through the halls of the Union, Whitman deified the spirit of revolt as a token of his understanding and admiration for the Confederate States now striving toward reconstruction, Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me, Morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences . . . . To Whitman, therefore, the War settled nothing unless untram- meled freedom was secured, not only for the slaves, but for every individual and every State. Although "my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,'' the rebellious spirit that led him to his death must be perpetuated. Even in old age, Whitman did not admit any inconsistency between order and progress, and the re- bellious pride exhibited by the Southern troops which had re- mained loyal to the Confederacy-the spirit embodied in the third person of the Square Deific: Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant "the great pride of man in himself," and I permit it to be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, defer- ence, and self-questioning. The Satan of the Square Deific is not, therefore, simply a nega- tive force opposing law and consolation in the universe.

In the political state, this Satan leads not to anarchy, but to freedom from the tyranny of legalism. Even in religion, Satan would exert a constructive force, for no religion in which he is a person in the Godhead can degener- ate into hollow dogma and priestly ritual. Thus is Whitman's re- ligion secure against the decay which he had observed undermining the Church of his day: Allons! From all formules! From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests. The stale cadaver blocks up the passage-burial waits no longer. The Santa Spirita, with which the fourth stanza of "Chanting the Square Deific" is concerned, does not appear by name in Whit- man's list of gods. The list does contain two names, however, which, although they do not occur in the stanza, suggest the nature and function of Santa Spirita: "Serapis or God of ensemble, I think,'' and more especially "Friday goddess Frixa-? Frigah, equal, coordinate feminine principle or divinity.'' Had Whitman meant his Godhead to represent the Christian Trinity with Satan added, as Stovall asserts, it seems likely that he would have named the remaining person Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit. His use of what would be the feminine form of the Italian Santo Spirito suggests that he may have conceived this side of the Square Deific as being different from the Holy Ghost in at least some respects. The feminine form of the name is significant. "Poem of the Road," Leaves (1856), p. 232; "Song of the Open Road," 11. 129-131. eS Notes and Fragments, p. 153. Ibid., p. 154. Op. cit., p. 410. The name has stimulated considerable comment. For example, Kennedy says (op. cit., p. 154), "'Santa Spirita' was another error, but it turned out fortunately, for scholars thought he [Whitman] might have intended to wrest the grammar. 'Santo Spirito' is good Italian. Whitman's error makes the Holy Ghost feminine, which is odd, but defensible, since that abstraction can't be said to have been thought of as possessing human sex, one way or the other." Symonds thought (op. cit., p. 26), somewhat more accurately it seems to me, that the feminine form of the name implies not femininity, but rather "a variation on the old theme of the Holy Ghost, introduced with sensitive aesthetic tact, but with more than an Emperor Sigismund's disregard for accidence, in order to shadow forth a frail and fugitive, but eminently vital, conception .... He is engaged in trying once again to express what Bruno thought, what throbs in the heart of those of us who feel that Science marries Religion-namely, that there is a point beyond Law, Love and Hatred, where the harmony we dimly guess, on which our faith is founded, merges in eternal, concrete, spiritual energy." Although some latitude of interpretation is possible in Williams's explanation (op. cit., p. 113) of feminine traits in Whitman's poetry on the grounds that the poet had "a</page><page sequence="21">"Chanting the Square Deific" 191 Just as the other three sides of the Square Deific are essentially masculine, as has already been pointed out, so the concept repre- sented by the fourth side is essentially feminine. Here, in a sense, is the progenitor of the gods-Gaea, the Earth Mother, the almost universal primitive symbol of the emergence of life. Whitman had acknowledged his own sensitiveness to the force in which life originates, but nowhere with greater beauty and emphasis than in the following lines, published in 1860: How the clouds pass silently overhead! How the earth darts on and on! and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and on l woman's soul in a man's body," this peculiarity in the name of the fourth side of the quaternity cannot be used to bear out the alleged homosexuality of Whitman, which Mark Van Doren imputes with fine rhetoric, but with scanty evidence, in "Walt Whitman, Stranger," American Mercury, XXXV, 277-285 (July, 1935). Trowbridge regarded the name as an inexcusable error. Recalling how he and O'Connor had pointed out to Whitman such faults as the inversion of the line "No poem proud I, chanting, bring to thee," and the use of the Spanish Libertad for Liberty, Trowbridge says: "! will say here that ! do not believe Whitman ever changed a line or a word to please anybody. In answer to criticism, he would at times maintain his point; at others, he would answer, in his tolerant, candid way, 'I guess you are right,' or, 'I rather think it is so;' but even when apparently convinced, he would stand by his faults. His use of words and phrases from foreign languages, which he began in his 1856 edition, which became a positive offence in that of 1860, he continued in the face of all remonstrance, and would not even correct errors into which his ignorance of those languages had be- trayed him. In one of his most ambitious poems, Chanting the Square Deific, he translates our good English 'Holy Spirit' into 'Santa Spirita,' meant for Italian; but in that language the word for 'spirit' is masculine, and the form should have been 'Spirito Santo,' with the adjective correspondingly masculine. William Rossetti, who edited a volume of selections from Leaves of Grass for the British public, pointed this out in a letter to Whitman, who, in talking of it with me, acknowledged the blunder; yet through some perversity he allowed it to pass on into subsequent editions. "In these editions Whitman showed that he was not averse to making changes . . ." (John Townsend Trowbridge, My Own Story, Boston, 1903, pp. 393-394). Thus did the Good Grey Poet tolerate the criticisms of his more "literary" friends. However, Rossetti, to whom Trowbridge appeals, shows in the following paragraph from a letter to Mrs. Gilchrist that he did not permit himself to be betrayed by his own knowledge of foreign languages and by too small an understanding of the American poet who used those languages for his own ends: "I agree with you that Whitman's 'orotund' (I doubt indeed whether it is exclusively his) is expressive; but I don't regard it as language. He wd. not, I fancy, have been obliged to me had I set Santa Spirita right: my impression being that he has turned masculine into feminine with a view to expressing what is call 'the feminine element,' but without that instinct or respect for linguistic forms wh. tells other men that Latin words actually existing can't have their genders topsyturvied, however convenient. Au reste I agree with you that the whole question of diction is, in comparison with the real grounds and measure of Whitman's greatness, a small affair" (William Michael Rossetti to Mrs. Gilchrist, Aug. 21, 1870, Clarence Gohdes and Paull Franklin Baum, eds., Letters of William Michael Rossetti, Durham, 1934, p. 61).</page><page sequence="22">192 American Literature How the water sports and sings! (Surely it is alive!) How the trees rise and stand up-with strong trunks- with branches and leaves! (Surely there is something more in each of the trees- some living Soul.) In her universal pervasiveness, embracing all life, Santa Spirita seems to suggest the love of a mother for her children. Whitman and his own mother were more than usually devoted to each other. It may be that in this stanza he is following his suggestion to himself: In Poems-bring in the idea of Mother-the idea of mother with numerous children-all, great and small, old and young, equal in her eyes-as the identity of America; but on an even more elevated scale, for Santa Spirita becomes the "identity" of the Godhead. In a note written in 1860-1861 (?), Whitman elaborated this plan for an artistic representation of a spiritual force binding the universe together as a mother binds her family together: Make a Picture of America as an IMMORTAL MOTHER, surrounded by all her children young and old-no one rejected-all fully accepted-no one preferred to another. Make her seated-she is beauti- ful beyond the beauty of virginity-she has the inimitable beauty of the mother of many children-she is neither youthful nor aged-around her are none of the emblems of the [feudal] classic goddess-nor any feudal emblems-she is serene and strong as the heavens. Make her picture, painters! And you her statue, sculptors! Try age after age, till you achieve it! For as to many sons and daughters the perfect mother is the one where all meet, and binds them all together as long as she lives, so the Mother of These States binds them all together as long as she lives. In the same way, Jehovah, Consolator, and Satan unite mystically in Santa Spirita, who likewise binds them together.

Her inclusive sympathy replaces that of the Virgin Mary, as it was popularly understood during the Middle Ages. Such a love Whitman was certain exists universally-"it waits and has always been waiting, latent in all men.'' It sur- vives after death. It is the pure, tender affection which engenders "the institution of the dear love of comrades" that he had promised to establish everywhere. Santa Spirita represents not only the affection "including God, including Saviour and Satan, ethereal, pervading all": she is the source of life-she is life: Santa Spirita, breather, life, Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man, I, the general soul, Here the square finishing, the solid, I the most solid, Breathe my breath also through these songs. She animates not only nature, but also art. In this capacity, she is the "essence of forms,'' a philosophic idea with which Whitman grappled in the following fragment, which is more concrete in its statement than the Santa Spirita stanza: As of Forms. Their genesis, all genesis, They lost, all lost-for they include all. The earth and everything in it, The wave, the snake, the babe, the landscape, the human head, Things, faces, reminiscences, presences, conditions, thoughts- tally and make definite a divine indistinct spiritual delight in the soul.

This, then, is Santa Spirita-projected though the four-sided deity, as in geometry a line is projected in a plane perpendicular to itself for the distance of its own length to generate a square- touching and including the other three sides; resolving, as Whit- man thought, all contradictions; and thus becoming the symbol for the whole. She represents a more definite conception of the cosmic Concord, perhaps identified with "Goodness or Love," whom he had envisioned in an early version of paragraph 44 in "Song of Myself": My spirit sped back to the times when the earth was burning mist, And peered aft and could see Concord beyond the aft, forming the mist, And brings the word that Dilation or Pride is a father of Causes, And a mother of Causes is Goodness or Love- And they are the Parents yet, and witness and register their amours eternally; And devise themselves to These States this hour. And my spirit travelled ahead and pierced the stern hem of life and went fearlessly through, And came back from the grave with serene face, And said, it is well, I am satisfied, I behold the causes yet. In conclusion, "Chanting the Square Deific" is an intensely sub- jective statement of Whitman's theological tenets. It not only explains the Godhead of which he believed himself to be the major prophet, but it also harmonizes his refusal to conform to one creed with his eagerness to embrace all creeds. The result of extensive reading and reflection, it is the sum of painstaking effort and revision-so perfect in Whitman's eyes that after its publication he was moved to add but a single word. For theology, it marks the fulfillment of his function as a poet, first stated crudely in "Song of 8~ Notes and Fragments, p. 26; also published among "Rejected Lines and Passages" in The Complete Writings o/ Walt Whitman, III, 266.

Whit- man compounds in his four-sided Godhead qualities universal enough to include hierarchs of many nations and ages, and at the same time, sufficiently specific to compose a single, fairly compact concept of deity. This deity embraces much of American idealism -the stern morality of the Puritan; the brotherly affection of the camp meeting and frontiersman; the pride and rebellion of the Southern gentleman-all harmonized and unified by Santa Spirita. The apparent conflicts among the first three sides-law, consolation, and revolt-develop a masculine hierarchy; the feminine Santa Spirita mystically resolves the eternal conflict with love, and gives direction and form to the divine energies released as the life-force. **Leaves (x855), p. 48; "Song of Myself," 11. xo96-xxxo. ~4 "Passage to India," 11. ~I6 ff.</page></plain_text>
