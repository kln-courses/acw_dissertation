INI Amongst the more or less forced interpretations which have been brought to IUI bear upon the swastika, one of the simplest is that which defines it as the ancient Iindian symbol of the Wheel of the Law. I do niot know whether this is meanlt to imply that it is a derivative of the spoked wheel which is recogniised as one of the greatest inventions in primitive transport, but the idea of rotation, inseparable from a wheel, certainly would seem to be conveyed in the swastika, whatever the actual origin of its peculiar form may have been. The term swastika is merely the Sanskrit name of a widely-distributed symbol, by no means the exclusive property of Hilldu and Buddhist mysticism. It was pro- bably old even in ancient days although its concentrated spirituality, like that of all hieroglyphs, denotes an advanced state of culture. Into its metaphysical qualities I am very far from wishinog or being able to enter, nor would this be the place to do so, but I have recently had occasion, in connection with the compilation of a descriptive list of ancient bronzes in the Colombo Museum (vide 8Spolia Zeylanica, Vol. VI, Part XXII, September 1909), to conlsider the possibility of an anthropomorphic explanation which seems to accord with its probable antiquity and with what is known of otlier derived designs. The sign of the swastika is not very frequently found in anl original state in Ceylon, though it does occur incised upon stone, as on an image of the sacred footprints (Sri pada) and on ancienit pottery. Finely-executed rosettes in the form of scrolled or floreated swastikas are carved on the wooden pillars of the principal dewiile at Badulla. I believe these latter have never yet been figured or even mentioned in any published work. It seems safe to say that the swastika is a symbol of pre-Buddhist origin and of world-wide distribution, but it is rare to fiiid it in an ancient state as a separate portable charm. A small solid bronze swastika, about 21 ilnches in diameter, found at Anuradhapura has been exhibited for manly years in the Colombo Museum. A somewhat larger metal swastika with more slender arms and of cruder construction was recently unearthed by the archoeological survey at Polonnaruwa ((Ceylon Administration Reports, 1909, Colombo Museum). As a miniature, the swastika appears to represent the limitless immensity of space reduced to the dimensions of a pocket amulet. fts typical shape is that of a Greek cross [it occurs on Greek coiils] with the ends of the beams bent at a right angle in one direction either to right or to left. In the preface to the second reprint of the Report on the Old Records of the India Office (London, 1891), Sir George Birdwood gives an explanation of the ritualistic significance of the swastika as manifested in Hindu symbolism. He says that the "right-hand swastika is, among " modern Hindus, a symbol of Ganeesa, anid is commonly placed by tlhem, instead of the " image of Ganeesa at the head of invoices anid other papers." It is also the symbol of the sun in his diurnal course from east to west, and it is coloured red, the proper colour of the East. The left-hand swastika is the symbol of Kali, the mother of Ganeesa, and of the sun in hiis nocturnal course from west to east, and is coloured blue. The right and left hand forms are spoken of as "reversely revolving swastikas." The deities who preside over the four quarters of the universe, or what conmes to the same thing in Oriental cosmogony, the four cardinal points of the compass, are called in the Sinhalese vernacular the Hataravaran-deviyo or Sataravaran-deviyo. In a coloured wood-carving some 18 inches in diameter, nlow exhibited in the Colombo Museum, they are represented in a realistic manner revolving round the sun in the direction of the hands of a watch. The right hand of each figure is raised over the head to grasp the extended right foor of the next one, eacli right forearm is bent [ 183</page><page sequence="2">No. 101.) MAN.

The Chaturmaharajika-chakra (symbol of the four guiardian deities) occasionally appears as a decorative design upon Sinbalese brass tobacco or betel boxes. An example of this kind is figured on p. 91 in Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy's monograph on Mediakval Sinhalese Art, and on p. 106 of the same work the design is described as "four women arranged swastika-wise." The second object mentioned in the title of this note, namely, the Sinhalese udakiya, is a small hand drum, shaped like an hour glass, with a skin stretched across each end (Fig. 1). It is carried by dancers in procession on ceremonial and festive occasions, as at Perahera, and is commonly made of wood lacquered with circular bands of red, yellow, and black. Its sociological importance is indicated by the fact that it has been executed in precious ivory. An example in brass is shown at the British Museum. In old bronze statuettes of the dancing Siva, called Nata-raja, one of the hands is represented holding an udakiya. This particular form of Eastern drum has therefore clearly an ancient meaning, and what this meaning is may possibly be revealed by a comparison with somewbat similar objects from Tibet. The direct comparability of tbese things is vouched for by the well-known historical connection between Northern and Southern Buddhism. The illustration (Fig. 2), from a photograph kindly sent to me at my request by Dr. H. S. Harrison, shows three drums and a skull-cup from Tibet, which are exhibited side by side in the Horniman Museum at Forest Hill. The first example is described as a drum, or rattle, with a string knotted at the end, on either side of the drum, for striking. It is made from the upper part (calotte or calvarium) of two human skulls, inverted and superposed, the ends covered with skin. The long diameter is given as 6i inches. Next to this is a circular wooden drum, covered with skin at the two ends, with string and leaden striker and ornamental sasb. It is a conveDtionalised form of the skull-drum, round instead of ovate, with a diameter of 6i inches. The third specimen is one shaped like the original skull-drum, though smaller, with a long diameter of 4i inches; it is executed in brass and bears an inscription. The fourth and last member of this interesting series is a drinking cup made from the skull of a Tibetan Lama. This use of the human calvarium is paralleled by a [ 184 ] FIG. 1. 4 - * imS ..... ........ F 2 FIG. 2.</page><page sequence="3">1910.] MAN.

It seems certain that the Sinhalese udakiya and the Tibetan skull-drum belong to one and the same category, a,nd that the former is a derivative of the latter. The employment of the skull of a holy man or of an enemy as a drinking or dipping vessel belongs to another category, and there may be other examples of it with which I am not at present acquainted.
