<plain_text><page sequence="1">PANPSYCHISM AND FREEDOM. IN the course of his review of M. Frutiger's Volonte et Conscience in the January number of this REVIEW, Professor Bennett alludes in passing to a difficulty in the panpsychist view of the world, which is of more than passing interest. This view (he says in substance) gives a new aspect to material nature, so that, if we take it seriously, we hardly feel free to treat physical objects in the customary utilitarian way. " Put me in a world where all is in some sense (however ob- scure) spirit, where everywhere there is some degree of liberty and spontaneity, and you embarrass me strangely. . . . The coal for the furnace, the stone that goes into our houses, the steel that goes into our machines-these are now, after some mysterious fashion, my own kith and kin." Hence he must treat them differently-how can they be made mere means to his own ends? Is there not an advantage in keep- ing to the old view of " dead matter "-something without embarrassing factors in its make-up, " indefinitely plastic, indefinitely usable " ? Yet one or two things may be said. (i) Something like freedom and spontaneity-if we mean by this simple non-determination from without-does appear in matter. When, for instance, a body falls to the earth, we are unable to discover any force making it do so, and say it falls of itself. We may throw a ball up in the air, but no hand is necessary to make it come down-it has its own specific attraction or impulse toward the centre of the earth. So with the varied specific chemical attractions. They are not taught the different atoms, or im- posed on them, but, so far as we can see, are spontaneous, come from their own nature. We may not perhaps say that they have a will, but</page><page sequence="2">286 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXI. they have something curiously like it-at least they do not appear to follow anybody else's will. Professor Bennett speaks of matter as in- definitely plastic, but surely it is not absolutely so-it has its own tendencies and constitution, will do some things and not others; and this has to be reckoned with in all manipulation of it. In fact it may be questioned whether its usableness does not depend on its limited plasticity, whether it is not usable just because it is definitely, fixedly so and so. (2) But it may be said that while this is true, we have here nothing psychic'-'psychic' being coterminous with feeling and con- sciousness. This is perhaps a matter of definition; but evidently Pro- fessor Bennett takes spontaneity to be one of the characteristic marks of the psychic, and I think he is right. Whatever moves itself instead of having to be set in motion by an outside agent has something of that strange, mystic quality that we call psychical-the real opposite of psychic being mechanical. And in the sense of psychic as connoting feeling, spontaneity or self-activity may at least be said to be the basis or preliminary condition of it, something developing it on occasion, having always latent possibilities of it-this in contrast with the view of feeling as a sheer addition, due to the engrafting of a foreign substance. (3) Yet even on the view that self-active matter has a modicum of feeling at the start, does this entail the embarrassing consequences that Professor Bennett suggests? Feeling need not be of one kind, any more than of one degree. Our human type of sensibility is not of necessity the only type in the world. If we should burn as coal does in our furnaces, we should suffer terribly (at least at the start), but it does not follow that the atoms of coal would-they might even make light of being restored thus to their pristine independence and be quite content. If we were laid on top of one another to make a stone wall or the foundations of a house, we should experience a most uncom- fortable pressure, but there may be nothing averse to pressure in stones. And so on. Panpsychism is in a way anthropomorphism, but we need not put ourselves bodily into the elements. Or if the cause of Professor Bennett's hypothetical embarrassment is not so much the suffering we should inflict (supposing the panpsychic view were cor- rect), as the fact that it revolts us to use self-acting, semi-psychic things as means, then surely some commonplaces of human experience may be called to mind. We all (unless possibly the Behaviorists) re- gard animals as psychic beings, our 'kith and kin' so far, and yet we are hardly averse to using them on occasion. We even think it</page><page sequence="3">No. 3.] DISCUSSION. 287 proper that their strength, their speed, their cunning, even their ferocity should minister to us-we find a natural Rangordnung (to use Nietzsche's expression) in the world of this general character; that the lower should serve the higher seems right-and the proud sentiment of human dignity in particular is expressed in the Bible itself. The recognized subordination of lower to higher goes even to extremes. We use animals-not to say living things in general-not merely as living, but as dead and particularly as dead-we kill them, eat them, and but few have reproaches of conscience in doing so. In- deed, if all life were held sacred, we human beings should not be able to live at all and should have to become Buddhists and Schopen- hauerians in the strictest sense, for our life hangs on the destruction of lower life. As Nietzsche puts it, "Leben und Morden ist eins "- the vegetable world may live off the inorganic elements, but we cannot. The rule not to make others means to our own ends must then apply to equals only-and perhaps even among men, not all are equal. More- over, may not lower things-men included-be willing to be used, and in a sense, though this may be possible to man only, proud to be, since thereby they acquire a worth that they could not have in themselves- the only condition being that there should be something truly higher to be served? We need not hold that the democratic idiosyncrasy and egoism is universal in the world. All this is irrespective of the ulterior question whether our practical convenience and ease of mind are a test of truth. WILLIAM M. SALTER. WASHINGTON, D. C.</page></plain_text>
