There is no reference to the Lamb of God, for instance, in "The Passion"; Milton leaves the poem before arriving at the account of Jesus's suffering on the cross. The metaphoric lambs that appear in the paraphrase of Psalm 114, placed in Poems 1645 between "The Passion" and the Nativity Ode, represent divine omnipotence rather than the humility of sacrifice. In Jewish liturgical tradition, Psalms 113 and 114 are sung before the Passover meal.1 In Milton's youthful version of the psalm, The high, huge-bellied Mountains skip like Rams Amongst their Ews, the little Hills like Lambs. (11-12) These frolicking metaphoric lambs are part of the psalm's homage to the miracu lous natural phenomena that accompanied the Exodus rather than to any evocation of the blood sacrifice that marked the first Passover. The timeless existence of the slain Lamb of God, rather than the slaying, is the focus of a reference in Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio. At issue here is the 223 © 2007 The Author.

Royalists hold up the verse as proof that monarchs are answerable only to God; republi cans reply that anyone in David's kingdom might ask for God's pardon. Salmasius, reasserting the royalist position in Defensio Regia, claims that Christ's general remission of sins was not available before the Incarnation (68). Milton seizes upon the claim and charges that it is a new heresy, supporting his charge by citing Revelation 13.8: "Orthodoxi, non nisi per sanguinem agni mactati ab initio mundi, peccata unquam remissa fuisse credunt" (CW 7: 198; "The ortho dox belief is that no sins were ever remitted save by the blood of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" [CPW 4: 394]). Given not only his reticence about the Passion but also the nature of De Doctrina Christiana, it is unsurprising that Milton does not dwell on the pathos of Jesus's sacrifice. In Book 1, Chapter 14, "Of Man's Restoration and of Christ the Redeemer," he again quotes Revelation 13.8 (CW 15: 256; CPW 6: 417). It is in his discussion of the sacraments in Book 1, Chapter 27, that he has most to say about the Lamb of God. He begins by defining the Passover as the type of the Lord's Supper, emphasizing the purity of heart necessary for partaking of the "feast." After quoting from Exodus 12, he states simply: Paschatis autem significatio erat Christus mactatus eiusque sanguinis aspersi efficacia ad salutem eis qui festum lllud puro corde celebrar ent; loan.i.29. vidit Ioannes Iesum venientem ad se, et ait, ecce agnus ille Dei qui tollit peccata mundi. (CW 16: 168) (The passover symbolized, however, Christ's sacrifice and the efficacy of his sprinkled blood for the salvation of those who celebrated this feast with pure hearts; John i.29: John sees Jesus approaching and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. [CPW 6: 543]) Milton turns later in the chapter to the Lord's Supper, addressing there the Bible's peculiar use of figurative language in relation to sacraments. Symbol and sym bolized have a uniquely close relationship in sacramental language, he argues, and insufficient attention to this fact has led to error. He gives as an example the use of passover to signify "lamb": Exod. xii.ll. agnus pascha appellatur, quem locum ab adversariorum exceptionibus vindicant similia loca; Luc. xxii.7. mactari pascha. et v.8. parate nobis pascham. et 11. ubi pascha edam, et 12. illic parate pascham. (CW 16: 198) (In Exod. xii.ll a lamb is called the passover, and there are parallel passages which support this text against the objections which my opponents may take to it: Luke xxii.7: the passover be killed, and 8: prepare us the passover, and 11: where I shall eat the passover, and 12: there prepare the passover. [CPW 6: 555]) Milton's target, of course, is the literalism that leads to the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, which he calls anthropagy or cannibalism. © 2007 The Author.

Milton's refrain, repeated seventeen times, embodies futility and unsatisfied longing. That Thyrsis will no longer feed his lambs is generally read as Milton's farewell to writing pastoral poetry.4 "He is now to turn to epic," as Carey states (CSP, Epitaphium Damonis 18n). If the lambs of Epitaphium Damonis belong to biblical as well as classical tradition, Thyrsis's refusal to feed his lambs may also signify Milton's decision not to become a minister. The vision which ends the poem, ol Damon in heaven, combines Bacchic with apocalyptic ecstasy, the occa sion for which (so the poem's language implies) is the marriage celebration of the Lamb (Rev. 7.9, 14.1-5, 19.7-9).This ecstatic vision - available only to the inspired poet - constitutes a statement that serving the Lamb will not, for Milton, mean tending the flock as a clergyman. In An Apology against a Pamphlet, Milton returns to the passage in Revelation depicting the marriage celebration of the Lamb, acknowledging that it has special meaning for him. He invokes it in defending himself against accusations of "harlot ting" and bordello-haunting made by the author of A Modest Confutation (sig. A3r): Nor did I slumber over that place expressing such high rewards of ever accompanying the Lambe, with those celestiall songs to others inapprehensible, but not to those who were not defil'd with women, which doubtlesse meanes fornication: For mariage must not be call'd a defilement. (CPW 1: 892-93) Throughout his works, Milton identifies purity of heart as essential to those who will participate in the marriage feast of the Lamb; his anger against religious hypocrisy never cools. In Of Reformation, he revitalizes the traditional description of a hypocrite by alluding to the Lamb of God. Warning that the worldly ambition of Anglican prelates is now so overweening that they "affect to be Kings" (CPW 1: 593), he cites examples of clerics' treachery toward monarchs. In his relations with King Leo of Isauria, Milton states, Pope Gregory III "suttl'y acted the Lamb" until the king ordered religious icons to be destroyed. Then the pope "threw off his Sheepes clothing, and started up a Wolfe, laying his pawes upon the Emperours right, as forfeited to Peter" (CPW 1: 595).3 In Paradise Lost, it is the predator's threat that dominates the representation of lambs, metaphoric or otherwise. As Satan is the archetype of predation, so the lamb is the archetype of innocent victimhood, as in the simile in Book 3 that represents Satan's imminent threat to earth's inhabitants: As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; © 2007 The Author.

(431-38) Jesus's commandment to his disciples, "Feed my lambs" (John 21.15), is first perverted by Satan, who feeds on the Christian flock. In Book 4, he is shown exploiting the aura of innocence associated with lambs to cover his wolfish designs. Thus in serpent form he creates a pleasing pastoral fiction to entice the innocent Eve. Seeing a "goodly Tree [. . .] Loaden with fruit," he lies: I drew nearer to gaze; When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. (9.576-83) His exploitative fabling betrays, however, at least one truth, which is his unholy interest in vulnerable innocence. The final two books of Paradise Lost represent the lamb in its historical role as domestic animal, with all that implies about its status as material possession and signifier of wealth. In a reprise of the simile in Book 3, with its evocation of barren plain and threatened lambs, Michael in Book 11 shows Adam a vast territory given over to pillaging: a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, Thir Bootie, [. . .] (646-50) At the beginning of Book 12, the archangel tells Adam of the behavior of human beings after the Flood, as they show "some regard to what is just and right" (16): Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn, wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast. (18-21) Here, in a description that echoes Homer as well as the Bible, lambs figure equally in faithful sacrifice and holy feast. The fragility of this equilibrium is brought home by Michael's account of the swift rise of Nimrod, the "mightie Hunter" (PL 12.33). "Men not Beasts shall be his game" (PL 12.30), warns Michael—those men who "refuse / Subjection to his Empire tyrannous" (31-32). The effect of the extended passage, PL 12.18-35, is subtly to merge domestic beasts and human beings in notions of communion, enacted or violated—implying, in turn, that Jesus is most fully human when he is most clearly the Lamb of God. © 2007 The Author.

Gervase Markham explains in Hunger's Prevention (1621) that to make an "Engine" for catching larks, one must glue "twenty small pieces of Looking-Glasses" to a painted square of wood, which is then hung so that "in the continuall motion and tourning about, [it] will give such a gloryous reflection, that the wanton birds cannot forebeare but wil play about it with admiration, til they be taken" (118). In 1605, James I fell "into a great humour of catching larks," writes John Chamberlain, "and takes as much delight in it or more than hunting" (Letters: 1.212). However, as Keith Thomas explains, growing prosperity and "the extension of an anthropomorphic attitude to wild singing-birds meant that larks, linnets and thrushes, once so popular a feature of the English diet, would slowly disappear from the middle-class menu" (116).7 There would seem to be some tension between a readiness to eat the skylark and the clear enjoyment of its song. The lark is frequently praised as the herald of dawn and paired with the nightingale (q.v.), a tradition that Shakespeare plays with in Romeo and Juliet (3.5.1-32). Milton pairs lark and nightingale in the early "Carmina Elegiaca": Daulias argutum modulatur ab ilice carmen Edit et excultos mitis alauda modos. (7-8)8 (The Daulian bird trills her clear song from the oak tree, and the gentle lark pours out her exquisite harmonies.) The two birds are paired, more elaborately, in Prolusion 2, when Milton implies that the songs of the lark and nightingale echo the music of the spheres: Quid! quod credibile est ipsam alaudam prima luce recta in nubes evolare, &amp; Lusciniam totam noctis solitudinem cantu transigere, ut ad Harmonicam coeli rationem, quam attente auscultant, suos corrigant modulos.

In keeping with the prolusion's theme that day is more excellent than night, the lark receives special praise. Birds cannot hide their delight at the return of the day, says Milton; they sing from treetops, "aut sursum librantes se, &amp; quam possunt prope Solem volitent, redeunti gratulatura? luci" (CW 12: 136; "or darting upwards as near as they may to the sun, take their flight to welcome the returning day" [CPW 1: 227]). In A Maske, Comus gives an accurate description of the lark's nesting habits, for it lays its eggs on the ground, typically in a tussock of grass.9 Comus assures the Lady that if her brothers are in the vicinity, he will "know / Ere morrow wake, or the low roosted lark / From her thach't pallat rowse" (316-18). Comus's thoughts, like Belial's, are low He notices the lark's ground-nesting rather than its high soaring and singing, and the "low / But loyal cottage" (319-20) to which he offers to conduct the Lady while she awaits her brothers, though it sounds as innocent as the lark's thatched pallet, is low indeed. "L'Allegro" contains a fuller picture of the lark's distinctive habits. One of Mirth's pleasures is To hear the Lark begin his flight, And singing startle the dull night, From his watch-towre in the skies, Till the dappled dawn doth rise. (41-44) The referent of his (43) is most likely the lark rather than dull night, for in its soaring (figured as a high tower) the lark provides for dawn a pattern of rising.10 That Mirth expects to hear the beginning of the flight shows familiarity with the lark's habits. It is distinctive in having "a sustained song flight": it sings as it rises and hovers, and continues to sing as it sinks back to the ground (Burton, Field Guide 211). The lark's rising with song is dramatically contrasted with the foully rising cloud of locusts and scorpions in the prayer that concludes Of Reformation. Let not wolves (q.v.) and boars (q.v.), the enemies of true reform, prays Milton, bring about their damned designes that stand now at the entrance of the bottomlesse pit expecting the Watch-word to open and let out those dreadfull Locusts and Scorpions, to re-involve us in that pitchy Cloud of infernall darknes, where we shall never more see the Sunne of thy Truth againe, never hope for the cheerfull dawne, never more heare the Bird of Morning sing. (CPW 1: 614) Here, against enveloping, apocalyptic, spiritual darkness, the prayer opposes not only the eternal light of truth but the daily miracle of rising sun and singing lark. Milton's appreciation of that miracle is evident in An Apology, when, against the Confuter's malicious stories, he describes his daily routine: "up, and stirring [. . .] in Summer as oft with the Bird that first rouses, or not much tardier, to reade good © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="8">Milton Quarterly 229 Authors, or cause them to be read, till the attention bee weary, or memory have his full fraught" (CPW 1: 885). The fact that Milton uses "rowse" in connection with the lark in A Maske suggests that "the Bird that first rouses" here is also a lark. More compelling is the parallel between the lark's movements and those of the poet, as explained in Paradise Lost. As the lark soars aloft at the coming of the light, singing as it rises, so John Milton, according to his account in the poem and to those of two early biographers, rose at dawn to compose his poetry.11 It is the Son who imitates the movement of the lark in Paradise Regained during his wilderness temptation: Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, From whose high top to ken the prospect round. (PR 2.279-86) Rising from the earth and ascending to a high place for prospect, an action the Son will repeat at the crucifixion, is revealed to be the pattern of life-giving creativity. Of Reformation (CPW 1: 589) LEECH The final word of Horace's Art of Poetry is hirudo, "leech," employed for a verse-monger who attaches himself to an acquaintance and reads him to death (488).12 The biblical leech (which might well have served as a pattern for Lear and his two elder daughters) is equally antisocial: 15 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough. 16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. (Prov. 30) A gloss in the 1560 Geneva Bible notes: "The leache has the two forkes in her tongue, which here he calleth her two daughters, where by she sucketh the blood: and is neuer satiat; eue[n] so are the couetous extorsioners insatiable."13 It is the figurative leech inherited from classical and biblical (and specifically Proverbial) literature rather than the creature in the service of medicine that interests Milton in Of Reformation,14 He invokes it in his description of the bishops' dealings with "the Revennues and Riches of the Kingdome": "Two Leeches they have that still suck, and suck the Kingdome, their Ceremonies, and their Courts" (CPW 1: 589). © 2007 The Author.

(CPW 1: 590-91) What zoologists observe about the Order Hirudinea is also true of the figurative creature: "It is [. . .] very difficult to draw a sharp distinction between parasites and predators among the leeches" (Mann 141).

(21) Once the general council had "determined what was light and truth" and resolved to "cut off" all those who opposed it, "that Beast became then so powerfull, that none was able to wage war with him, but all the world wandred after him" (21). The leopard of zealotry derives from Revelation 13, which shows the satanic dragon transferring power and authority to an earthly government, represented as the seven-headed beast that rises from the sea.16 "And the beast [. . .] was like unto a leopard, and his feet were the as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion" (Rev. 13.2).17 Milton cites the transfer of power from dragon to beast in Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio to support his argument that the fact of political authority does not necessarily mean legitimacy (CIV 7: 10; CPW 4: 384). In The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, he states that most commentators interpret the "beast so autoriz'd" as "the tyrannical powers and Kingdoms of the earth" (CPW 3: 210). For Milton, the leopard-like beast of Revelation 13 remains, simply, "the beast." The term leopard itself had a wider range of reference in the early modern period than it has today. Lynxes and ounces (q.v.), for instance, could be called leopards, and in his 1720 revision of Stow's Survey, John Strype mentions "two Leopards, or Tygers."18 James Howell's statement that from the time of Edward IV leopards were housed with lions (q.v.) at the Tower of London must thus be treated with caution (24).19 The fact that leopard, libbard, pard, pardal, and panther were largely, though not entirely, interchangeable for most of the seventeenth century further complicates the semantic situation.20 Determining whether and which distinctions among the terms are intended is often difficult.21 Even when the leopard is declared to be the result of an adulterous union between a lioness and a pard—a notion based on the elements of its name (leo + pard)—the difference between the leopard and the pard is not clear. Nonetheless, the reputed unfaith fulness and predatory sexuality of its parents taint the leopard's reputation, and its spotted coat confirms the stigma.22 Thus, John Guillim states in A Display of Heraldrie that "the degenerate and Bastard race of Leopards" is "begotten between the Adulterous Lyonesse and the Parde" (190). Medieval heralds reasoned that the leopard was "an appropriate charge for someone born in adultery or someone barred from producing heirs of his body, such as an abbott" (Woodcock and Robinson 64). Stories about the leopard's extraordinary guile, mostly derived from Pliny, sup ported its association with illicit behavior. "Leopards lie in awaite among the thickets of trees," states Pliny, "hidden within the braunches; and so seize upon them that passe by, and make spoile even from the place where foules use to perch" (Holland 1.308; NH 3: 420).23 Milton's earliest references to the leopard allude to its conventionally blem ished reputation. In A Maske the Elder Brother, arguing that chastity is invincible, cites the huntress Diana's taming of "the brinded lioness / And spotted mountain pard" (443-44).

(CPW 2: 738) The leopard's spots are free of this figural significance, however, in Paradise Lost. The pard is named among the creatures that Satan sees frisking about Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden: Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl'd the Kid; Dears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards Gambold before them. (4.343-45) George Walker specifically excludes leopards from paradise in God Made Visible in His Works (1641) on the grounds that "mixed creatures of mungrell kinds as Mules, which are engendered of Asses, and Mares; Leopards, which are of the Libbard and Lionesse" are not "Gods workmanship" (163).24 His use of Libbard rather than pard suggests that the rationale for the leopard's supposed hybridity was fading from popular memory. In any case, Walker has forgotten what Milton's verses clearly recall, Isaiah's vision of a new Eden, in which "the leopard shall lie down with the kid" (Isa. 11.6). When in Book 7 of Paradise Lost Raphael describes the sixth day of Creation, he includes the leopard among those wild animals that do not gather in herds: The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw In Hillocks; (7.463-69) Though "rare and solitarie," these great cats are not represented as unique and strange individuals to be wondered at, as if they were exhibitions in a curiosity cabinet (PL 7.461). On the contrary, this is a family portrait; how lions, ounces, leopards, and tigers are alike is more important here than how they differ. The fact that they are also likened to moles and shown "scratching up Hillocks before them" is offensive to Richard Bentley (PL 7.463n). But the function of the simile is to undermine, "as the Moale" undermines, the ground for assuming that greater size and ferocity confer greater value.

In the thirteenth century, the royal lions kept at Woodstock by Henry I were moved to the Tower of London. There a royal menagerie, open to the public and maintained by the City of London, was in existence until 1834 and remained one of the most popular tourist attractions of the capital.25 King James seems to have been responsible for adding lion-baiting to the more traditional bull- and bear-baitings popular in London.26 In 1609, acting in effect as an experimental philosopher, James arranged a combat at the Tower between one of the lions and a bear that had killed a child.2' His aim was "to show his courtiers how the king of beasts dealt with refractory subjects" (Raven 231). The lion, however, tucked its tail between its legs and retired to a corner of the yard (Stow 1: 119). The behavior of Panthera leo had no effect upon the symbolic status of the lion, and King James had the bear baited to death. The lion's reputation derives partly from its appearance—with its mane playing a far from insignificant role—and partly from a selective reading of classical and biblical sources. Pliny explicitly associates its mane with courage and nobility: "The Lions are then [. . .] most strong and courageous, when the haire of their main or coller is so long, that it covereth both necke and shoulders." Only those "engendered by Lions" have manes, he continues; "such as have Pards to their sires, [that is, those whose mothers have been adulterous] never have this ornament" (Holland 1.201; NH 3: 32). Holland's translation suggests an analogy between the lion's mane and certain human hair styles. John Guillim's discussion of the impor tance of the mane in A Display of Heraldrie is more explicit: "It is observed that the generous nature of the Lyon, is discerned by his plentifull shaggy lockes that doe cover his necke and shoulders, which are infallible tokens of his noble courage, especially if those his locks be crisped and curled, and short withall" (189). So construed, and with obvious links to Samson's unshorn locks, the lion's mane contributes to the iconographic tradition of long manly hair, a tradition appropriated by the Cavaliers and interrogated by Milton.28 In Paradise Lost, Adam's locks "from his parted forelock manly hung / Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad" (4.302-03, emphasis added), and as Charles Ross has noted (122), Raphael's description of the © 2007 The Author.

Ulisse Aldrovandi's encyclopedia of viviparous quadrupeds is not, as one might expect, alphabetical, but rather begins with a chapter on the lion. The chapter occupies slightly less than a tenth of the entire space Aldrovandi allots to wild animals (2-63). Similarly, the first exhibit listed under "Fourfooted Beasts" in the Musceum Tradescantianum (1656) is "Lion's head and teeth" (Tradescant 5). Sylvester's translation of Du Bartas's hexameral poem devotes almost a hundred lines to the lion, whose creation is represented as immediately preceding that of human beings (Divine Weeks 1.6.327 418).29 The assumption that the lion is sovereign among creatures evolved over centuries. Aristotle, who declares that animals differ from each other in terms of their disposition, finds that some, like the lion, "are noble and brave and high-bred" (1: 18). Pliny elaborates: "The Lion alone of all wild beasts is gentle to those that humble themselves unto him, and will not touch any such upon their submission, but spareth what creature soever lieth prostrate before him. As fell and furious as hee is otherwhiles, yet he dischargeth his rage upon men, before that he setteth upon women, and never preyeth upon babes unlesse it be for extreame hunger" (Holland 1.201; NH 3: 38). The Bible offers a confirming instance of Pliny's assertion: the prophet Daniel, thrown into a den of lions, declares, "My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me" (Dan. 6.22). Indeed, the judeo-Christian tradition amply confirms the high status given to the lion by classical literature. The Physiologus opens with a chapter on the lion and identifies it with Christ, the Lion of Judah. The creature's three most important characteristics—that it covers its tracks with its tail so that the hunter cannot find it; that it sleeps with its eyes open; that its cubs are born dead and brought back to life after three days by the father's breath—are allegorized in terms of Jesus's Incarnation, his unfailing divinity, and his resurrection (Baxter 37-39). Medieval bestiaries generally repeat this material and add to it the Plinian claims that it is afraid only of the cock, the scorpion's sting, and the snake's bite, and that "in spite of its menacing brows, leo never attacks women and children—nor a man who prostrates himself before it" (George and Yapp 48). In "Elegia Quarta," written when he was eighteen years old to his tutor, Thomas Young, Milton asks forgiveness for his delay in writing, reminding Young, "Vulnifico pronos nec rapit ungue leo" (64) ("nor does a lion drag his wounding claws over those who lie prone"). Classical and especially biblical traditions, however, could also be used to disparage the lion as a symbol of nobility and courage. This trend becomes more pronounced in the seventeenth century as natural historians increasingly con centrate on the lion's physiological characteristics and republicans reconstrue the symbolic value of those characteristics. The royalist Thomas Browne, for instance, protests that he is "unwilling to question the Royall supporters of England, that is, the approved descriptions of the Lion and the Unicorne." He nevertheless observes that "if in the Lion the position of the pizell be proper, and that the naturall situation; it will be hard to make out their retrocopulation, or their coupling and pissing backward, according to the determination of Aristotle" (PE 1: 415).30 That is, "[a] 11 that urine backward do copulate [. . .] aversly, as Lions, Hares, Linxes" (PE 1: 415)—and in thus summarizing Aristotle, Browne places the hare and the lion © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="14">Milton Quarterly 235 on the same level. In this, he may be following the lead of Plmy, who reports: "The Lions lift up a legge when they pisse, as dogges do" (Holland 1.201; NH 3: 36). Browne also investigates the ancient dictum that lions are afraid of cocks, a piece of lore tranquilly coexisting for centuries with the lion's reputation for unmatched courage. Browne reports: "In our time in the Court of the Prince of Bavaria, one of the Lions leaped down into a Neighbour's yard, where nothing regarding the crowing or noise of the Cocks, he eat them up with many other Hens" (PE 1: 259).31 Although demolishing the fable preserves the lion's reputation for courage, it damages its reputation for nobility, its refusal to harm a defenseless foe, a fact parenthetically acknowledged by Browne: "And therefore a very unsafe defensative it is against the fury of this animal (and surely no better than Virginity or bloud Royal) which Pliny doth place in Cock broth" (PE 1: 259). Characteristically critical of Browne's experimental method and its undermining of traditional wisdom, Alexander Ross objects that the fact that this lion was afraid of this cock "must not overthrow an universal! Rule or Maxime. [. . .] it may be that this Lion was mad, and so the phantasie distempered [. . .] or else he was a hungred, and hunger we know makes even men transgresse the common lawes of Nature, and eat those things which otherwise they hate" (145). But of course what is supposed to make the lion—and by implication, the monarch—"kingly" is precisely the over coming of natural instinct by innate nobility Milton's representation of the lion (with the possible exception of that in "Elegia Quarta") is characterized by determined resistance to the notion of the animal's kingliness. He steadfastly declines to use the analogy between the lion and the earthly, Stuart, monarch. Especially in his early poetry, he alludes to the "dissenting" tradition in classical literature's portrait of the lion; but his later and most powerful alternative readings of the beast are based on biblical material. The lion of In Quintum Novembris appears in a satirical context saturated with beastliness as Milton compares the disguised devil to St. Francis: Talis, uti fama est, vasta Franciscus eremo Tetra vagabatur solus per lustra ferarum, Sylvestrique tulit genti pia verba salutis Impius, atque lupos domuit, Lybicosque leones. (86-89) (Such a figure, so it is said, was Francis, as he wandered alone in the vast dessert, in the hideous habitats of wild beasts, bearing godly words of salvation to poor peasants, a godless creature himself, who tamed the wolves and the lions of Libya.) In Prolusion 1, Night is said to have rendered our hearing more acute so that "rugitus Leonum, quos fames evocat" (CW 12: 144; "the roaring of lions that prowl in search of prey" [CPW 1: 230]), strikes us with more terror. In A Maske, the Lady cites as evidence of chastity's power the fact that "ever chaste" Diana "tam'd the brinded lioness / And spotted mountain pard" (442-44).The adjective "brinded" indicates the color of the lioness but also implicates her in lustful burning.32 As Pliny recounts (3: 32), the lioness is prone to adultery with the panther, a union that produces "the degenerate and Bastard race of Leopards" (Guillim 190). The spotted hide of the leopard (q.v.), like the brinded hide of the lioness, signifies sexual incontinence. © 2007 The Author.

Alcuin and Bede warn against them (Curtius 184), and William Harrison (clearly attempting to reconcile what he has read with what he has seen, or failed to see), relegates them to a distant past and place: "Lions we have had very many in the north parts of Scotland, and those with mains of no less force than they of Mauretania were sometimes reported to be; but how and when they were destroyed, as yet I do not read" (325). Lions are the enemy of Damon and Thyrsis in Epitaphium Damonis. "Lions and wolves," remark the editors of the Variorum Commentary, "belong more to the pastoral tradition than to Milton's England" (Bush et al 302). Sive opus in magnos fuit eminus ire leones Aut avidos terrere lupos praesepibus altis. (41-42) (whether the task was to challenge full-grown lions, to frighten the greedy wolves away from the tall sheepfolds.) The companion shepherds, in doing what is necessary to protect their sheep, have also imitated the biblical David (1 Sam. 17.34). Arthur Marotti observes, "David boasts that he had slain a lion and a bear and was therefore able to face Goliath" (79).33 In contrast to Milton's early representations of the lion, which remain within the limits marked out by biblical and classical literature, those in the anti-prelatical tracts are notable for their imaginative freedom. In Of Reformation, Milton depicts the papacy as beginning in a relatively small though destructive way in Constantine's reign and assuming ever larger and more fearsome dimen sions over time: "hitherto [the Pope] was but a Caterpiller secretly gnawing at Monarchy, the next time you shall see him a Woolfe, a Lyon, lifting his paw against his raiser, as Petrarch exprest it, and finally an open enemy, and subverter of the Greeke Empire" (CPW 1: 577).34 Just detectable here is the image of a caterpillar (q.v.) bursting out of its chrysalis as a wolf or a lion. When the lion reappears in Of Reformation, its position is even less exalted. The reform-minded kings of Judah, declares Milton, "fear'd not the bug-bear danger, nor the Lyon in the way that the sluggish and timorous Politician thinks he sees" (CPW 1: 602). With a glance at prelates more desirous to please their monarch than to embark upon reform, he reduces the lion to a figment, a species of bugbear. In Reason of Church-Government Milton writes a fable based on a biblical paradox. True humil ity, signified by an ass (q.v.), is in fact a lion (of Judah); pride, signified by the lion (of earthly jurisdiction), is in fact an ass: so long as the Church in true imitation of Christ can be content to ride upon an Asse carrying her self and her government along in a mean and simple guise, she may be as he is, a Lion of the tribe of Juda, and in her humility all men with loud Hosanna's will confess her greatnes. But when despising the mighty operation of the spirit by the weak things of this world she thinks to make her self bigger and more considerable by using the way of civil force and jurisdic tion, as she sits upon this Lion she changes into an Asse, and instead of Hosanna's every man pelts her with stones and dirt. [. . .] the © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="16">Milton Quarterly 237 Church coveting to ride upon the Lionly form of jurisdiction makes a transformation of her self into an Asse, and becomes despicable, that is to those whom God hath enlight'nd with true knowledge; but where they remain yet in the reliques of superstition, this is the extremity of their bondage, and blindnes, that while they think they doe obeisance to the Lordly visage of a Lion, they doe it to an asse. {CPW 1: 833-34) Milton is glancing here not only at the description of Christ's entry into Jerusalem on the colt of an ass, but also at Aesop's tale of the foolish ass who thinks the crowd worships it rather than the statue of the god it carries. Uniquely in the anti prelatical tracts, the lion in An Apology Against a Pamphlet is valued positively. But it does not symbolize earthly power or status. Milton asks "leave to soare a while as the Poets use" and imagines the Chariot of Zeal drawn by two meteors resembling the beasts in Ezekiel (1.10) and Revelation (4.7), "the one visag'd like a Lion to expresse power, high autority and indignation" (CPW 1: 900). There is a vast distance between the qualities signified by the apocalyptic lion and the qualities possessed by those human monarchs who style themselves lions. In the prose works concerned with the execution of Charles I, the symbolic lion, unsurprisingly, is subjected to Milton's most vigorous and innovative recon struing. In the issue of April 16, 1649, the royalist periodical, The Man in the Moon, reported: "The Lyons in the Tower, (since the King was murdered) have mourned extreamly, Roar'd out his obsequies, and are now (all but the Princes) dead" (Crouch 8). To this, a biblical epigraph on the title page of Eikonoklastes might serve as a retort: "As a roaring Lyon, and a ranging Beare, so is a Wicked Ruler over the poor people" (Prov. 28.15). The symbolic beast undergoes further degrading criticism in Milton's tract, courtesy of Chapter 18 of Machiavelli's Prince, which contrasts two modes of enforcing authority, that of the fox (i.e., cunning) and that of the lion (i.e., force). "[T]here hath bin no where found more bestialitie than in treating" (CPW 3: 521), declares Milton. Making treaties as the King's forces did at Uxbridge "hath no more commendation in it than from fighting to come to undermining, from violence to craft, and when they can no longer doe as Lions, to doe as Foxes" (CPW 3: 521). In Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio, Milton explicitly rejects the analogy between king and lion, basing his rejection on biblical verses dealing with deliverance from evil. In Psalm 22, which famously opens with the anguished question quoted by Christ on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" the psalmist prays to be saved "from the lion's mouth" (verse 21). In the second letter to Timothy, Paul quotes Psalm 22 to signify that God has not forsaken him: "the Lord stood with me, and strength ened me [. . .] and 1 was delivered out of the mouth of the lion" (2 Tim. 4.17). The lion of which Paul speaks was traditionally understood to be Nero,35 an identification Milton assumes in Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio: "De Nerone cum mentionem facit Paulus, non regem, sed Leonem, id est belluam immanem vocat, cujus ex ore ereptum se gaudet, 2 Tim. 4" (CW 7: 188; "When Paul speaks of Nero he calls him not king but lion, meaning wild beast, and rejoices that he was snatched from his jaws (II Timothy 4)"; [CPW 4: 390]). Milton turns the traditional interpretation of the Bible verse, that is, against the lion's traditional symbolic association with mercy, courage, and nobility, insisting by implication that the biblical metaphor refers to the lion's naturalistic qualities (wildness, © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="17">238 Karen Edwards ferocity in hunting). Milton's translation of Psalm 7 (dated 1653) needs to be read in light of this re-metaphorizing. In verse 1 of the Authorized Version the psalmist prays for deliverance "from all them that persecute me"; verse 2 makes these enemies singular: "Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver." In Milton's translation, the enemy is singular from the outset, and the word order is so arranged that Lion precedes and shapes the nature of the ferocity imputed to He: Lord my God to thee I flie Save me and secure me under Thy protection while I crie, Least as a Lion (and no wonder) He hast to tear my Soul asunder Tearing and no rescue nigh. (1-6) The parenthetical comment, apparently added to fill the numbers and provide a rhyme, hints that when one is repeatedly called a lion, one will finally behave as a lion, that is, a wild beast. Given Milton's comprehensive re-imagining of and resistance to common place notions about the kingly lion in his prose and early poetry, one is surprised to find the lion mentioned first among the playful beasts in the garden of Eden in Paradise Lost: About them frisking playd All Beasts of th'Earth, since wilde, and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards Gambold before them. (4.340-45) The verse suggests that the lion is most rampant—the heraldic word invariably used of the king of beasts—when it is most gentle. There is an obvious reference here to Isaiah's vision of the new Eden: "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fading together; and a little child shall lead them" (Isa. 11.6).36 In assigning the lion precedence in Paradise Lost, Book 4, Milton is establishing a latent contrast: just as the lion is most gentle in its paradisal behavior, so it is most ferocious after the Fall. In assigning it this precedence, Milton follows the Book of Job. When God answers Job "out of the whirlwind" (38.1), it is in effect to repeat the Creation story. The lion is the first animal named, for the power of God is immediately established by his control over this most rapacious and resourceful of hunters. "Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?" God demands of Job, "or fill the appetite of the young lions, When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?" (38.39-40). The sporting lion of Paradise Lost is shown dandling what young lions will in future devour. With biblical authority ("your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour" [1 Pet.5.8]), the lion next appears in the poem as a vehicle for Satan, who inhabits its body as he hunts his (own kind of) © 2007 The Author.

That the lion is Satan's first choice (a scarcely-veiled political comment) merely confirms the beast's precedence in ferocity. In Raphael's Creation narrative, the lion is and is not the first among the animals named individually for it is preceded by a calf, albeit in the form of a preterit: The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, And Rampant shakes his Brinded main. (7.463-66) Bentley is sarcastically scornful of this passage: "The poor Lion stuck fast in the Passage: he was form'd, it seems, in the Earth, without any Cavity for him. And his Hinderparts being much thinner than his Foreparts; if these were once out, he needed not to paw and struggle to free the Hinder ones, which could not possibly stick at all" (PL 7.463n). Bentley's literal reading is not literal enough in this instance. Raphael's lion does not emerge from the earth; it appears from a "grassie clod," which suggests that Raphael is describing the moment of the lion's creation, the moment at which the dust of the earth becomes a lion. In Book 8 of Paradise Lost, when Adam recounts for Raphael his first hours of life, he gives an account of his argument to God that animals cannot be consorts to humans: as animals "rejoyce / Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness" (392-93), so ought he to have a mate of his kind. Adam's choice of example is more complex than he knows, chiefly because of the tainted iconographical status of the lioness. In the History of Britain, Milton repeats Gildas's title for Boadicea, "the craftie lioness," because she betrays the Romans' trust in the British. The title, Milton notes, "leaves an ill fame upon her doeings" (CPW 5: 81). Lion and lioness appear together as mates only once in the Bible, when Nahum, speaking in the prophetic past tense, envisions their dwelling in what will become the destroyed city of Ninevah: "The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin" (Nah. 2.12). Savagery is depicted here, but in the context of the male's care for his mate and their offspring. Classical writers, in contrast, accuse the lioness of breaking the family bond by her propensity for adultery with the panther. They explain that the lion knows that the lioness has been unfaithful "by sent and smell of the Pard, when the Lionesse his mate hath plaied false, and suffered her selfe to be covered by him [...]. And therefore when the Lionesse hath done a fault that way, shee either goeth to a river, and washeth away the strong and ranke savour of the Pard, or else keepeth aloofe, and followeth the Lion farre off, that hee may not catch the said smell" (Holland 1.200; NH 3: 32). Adam's pairing of lion and lioness points, that is, to a future in which those joined together will not necessarily "rejoyce." Adam and Eve, and readers, have one glimpse of the postlapsarian lion in the garden of Eden. Significantly, it is not called by name: Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, First hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde. (PL 11.187-89). © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="19">240 Karen Edwards Fowler has pointed to one aspect of the portentous, symbolic content of the pursuit: "a sovereign [. . .] displays its power grimly changed. [. . .] The pursuit to the gate foreshadows the expulsion [. . .] the two beasts [. . .] standing for Adam and Eve" (PL 11.182-90n). But the lion has not been represented as sovereign in the poem, and we are made to see here that its reigning results from greater ferocity, not from divine sanction. Its savagery makes it first among savage beasts. This is indeed a "Beast that reigns." The technical vocabulary of hunting, though slightly skewed, is recognizable here, implying that the "gentle brace" is still being pursued in royal forests.37 In Paradise Regained, a lion appears with other wild beasts who grow "mild" (1.310) upon seeing Christ during his temptation in the wilderness (Mark 1.13):38 "his walk / The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, / The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof" (PR 1.311-13). Milton rejects the Utopian possibilities that some Renaissance commentators find in this scene.39 Far from licking Christ's hands (as Una's lion licks her hands at FQ 1.3.6.), this lion, like the tiger, merely refrains from aggression.40 Immediately thereafter, "an aged man in Rural weeds" approaches (PR 1.314), and we realize that the wild beasts around Christ are those which Satan inhabited in Paradise Lost. Samson, like Hercules, is traditionally associated with the lion. As the first of Hercules's labors is to kill the Nemaean Lion, so the first demonstration of Samson's heroic strength is to kill a young lion in the vineyards ofTimnath. George Sandys, for whom the defeat ol the lion represents the defeat of "rash Temerity," remarks that Hercules's feat "may be no fable, since the like was performed by Sampson (supposed by some the same man) and after by little David" (435).41 The Chorus establishes the association between Samson and the lion at the beginning of Samson Agonistes, for Samson's identity is bound up, for them, in his having killed a lion with his bare hands. Can this be that "Irresistible Samson" they ask upon first seeing him, "whom unarm'd / No strength of man, or fiercest wild beast could withstand; / Who tore the Lion, as the Lion tears the Kid" (126-28)? Clearly the lion is the "fiercest wild beast" in question. There is nothing kingly about it, a fact that Milton emphasizes by comparing it to a kid (as in Judg. 14.6).Within a dozen lines, the Chorus speaks of Samson himself as a lion: The bold Ascalonite Fled from his Lion ramp, old Warriors turn'd Thir plated backs under his heel; Or grovling soild thir crested helmets in the dust. (138-41) The import of the Chorus's praise is that the weapons and armor of the Philistine enemies are useless against Samson, "weaponless himself" (S./4 130), as if he is a "natural" warrior. But this portrait is subtly undermined by the artificial phrase, "Lion ramp." Milton has turned the heraldic adjective rampant into a truncated and undignified noun, the first poet (and one of very few ever) to do so, as John Carey notes (CSP, S/4 139n).There is no further mention of the lion in Samson Agonistes. The implication is clear: notions of heroic activity signified by identification with the lion are, finally, inadequate, unworthy, and foolish. © 2007 The Author.

(London, 1638), p. 214. Reproduced by permission of Exeter University. Considering the identity of the locusts eaten by John the Baptist in the wilderness (Matt. 3.4), Thomas Browne asserts that these are not the fruit of the carob tree, nor the tender tops of trees, as some have claimed.42 They are "prop erly Locusts," he states, "that is a sheath-winged and six-footed insect, such as is our Grashopper" (PE 1: 560). He reminds readers that locusts are "a food per mitted unto the Jewes" (Lev. 11.22) and are so regarded by many other nations as well. That John the Baptist "fared coursely and poorely" accords with his humble dress and abode, Browne concludes, a way of living that embodies "the doctrine he preached, humiliation and repentance" (PE 1: 561). What lies behind Browne's interest in John's diet is the status of the locust as a "clean" animal in Hebrew dietary law. James Hart in The Diet of the Diseased (1633) claims that God's permission implies a distinction among kinds of locusts: "that the Locust was a food, and used to be eaten, even among the Jewes themselves, at least some sorts, may by the 11. chap, of Levit. appeare, where foure sorts of Locusts were allowed to be eaten, and therefore called cleane, and other three sorts forbidden, © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="21">242 Karen Edwards and called uncleane" (85).43 Thomas Mouffet, who regards the locust as an instrument of divine punishment, sees in its status as a clean animal evidence of mercy at the heart of God's severity: "for being that Locusts have brought sundry Nations to want and hunger, and they have had no thing to eat, these Locusts have died suddenly, and became meat for the people they afflicted before" (The atrum 987). Yet he is clearly uneasy about the eating of locusts. Let anyone who wishes to know more "concerning Locusts for food," he concludes, "read the most learned Annotations of Venerable Bede upon St. Matthew" (Theatrum 987). Browne advances his own theory about clean and unclean animals in Hebrew law. The distinction is not medical, he asserts. Rather, "the consideration was hieroglyphicall; in the bosome and inward sense implying an abstinence from certain vices symbolically intimated from the nature of those animals" (PE 1: 267). That is why the law allows us to consume animals "such as Locusts and many others," from which in fact we choose to refrain (PE 1: 267). When in the course of the above discussion he equates the locust proper and "our Grashopper," Browne makes an important taxonomical point.44 If the English grasshopper is a locust, then it is not a cicada, the sweet singer of Greek and Roman literature, T£TTl^ (tettix), beloved of Anacreon, sacred to the Muses.45 Indeed, Browne states of the cicada, "there is no such insect in England for ought enquiry can informe" (PE 1: 372).46 There are many differences between the locust and the cicada, he points out, but chiefly this: "The Locust or our Grashopper hath teeth, the Cicada none at all" (PE 1: 372).47 The grasshopper, not the cicada, is responsible for the devastating incursions recorded in classical, biblical, and national histories.48 Browne's taxonomical point severs a hallowed if imaginary connection between classical antiquity and Renaissance England. By praising the Anacreontic "grasshopper" (which is, of course, a cicada), Cavalier poets lay claim to loving and being loved by the Muses.49 Their claim also reverses the standard interpretation of Aesop's fable of the grasshopper and the ant. In the lyrics of the Cavaliers, the pleasure-loving grasshopper/poet is more to be admired than the puritanical ant.30 Milton's refusal to call the grass hopper anything but "locust" indicates determined resistance to the Cavaliers' (mis)construing of the grasshopper.51 The grasshopper/locust in his works is invariably destructive. In the prophetic prayer that ends Of Reformation, Milton asks God to frustrate the plans of those who would destroy his people, those enemies who stand now at the entrance of the bottomlesse pit expecting the Watch-word to open and let out those dreadfull Locusts and Scorpi ons, to re-involve us in that pitchy Cloud of infernall darknes, where we shall never more see the Sunne of thy Truth againe, never hope for the cheerfull dawne, never more heare the Bird of Morning sing. (CPW 1: 614) The passage may glance at Phineas Fletcher's The Locusts, or Apollyonists, a poem on the involvement of the Jesuits (the titular locusts) in the Gunpowder Plot.52 Both Milton and Fletcher are evoking the apocalyptic locusts described in Revelation 9: "And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit [. . .] And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth" (9.2-3). These monstrous locusts hark back to the plague locusts described in Exodus: "For they covered the © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="22">Milton Quarterly 243 face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt" (10.15). The Exodus plague itself, as James Nohrnberg observes, suggests marauding soldiers: "Locusts, in biblical parlance, can stand for armies" (224).53 The locusts emerging from the bottomless pit in Revelation 9 bear a night marish resemblance to actual locusts. Their shape is "like unto horses prepared unto battle," and "they had tails like unto scorpions" (7, 10).54 The resemblance in the shape of horses' and locusts' heads and hind legs no doubt contributes to the traditional metaphoric association of armies and plagues of locusts. Browne points out that locusts, unlike cicadas, are "ordained for saltation, [hence] their hinder legs doe far exceed the other" (PE 1: 372).35 Also unlike cicadas, but possibly like scorpions, grasshoppers/locusts have "a long falcation or forcipated tayle behinde" (PE 1:372).The fact that the apocalyptic locusts have "teeth [. . .] as the teeth of lions" (Rev. 9.8) gives powerful figurative expression to their destructive devouring. Their hair—like "the hair of women" (Rev. 9.8)—gives rise to (parodic) comparisons between Cavaliers and "shag-poll locusts" in the pamphlet war of the 1640s.56 But perhaps the feature of the apocalyptic locusts most shocking and most pertinent to the seventeenth-century context is the fact that "they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit" (Rev. 9.11)—shocking because Proverbs 30.27, attributed to Solomon, declares, "The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands." At the conclusion of The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, Milton calls royalist clergymen of his own day "locusts" and finds a version of the torment of Revelation 9 in their covetousness &amp; fierce ambition, which as the pitt that sent out thir fellow locusts, hath bin ever bottomless and boundless, to interpose in all things, and over all persons, thir impetuous ignorance and importunity. (CPW 3: 258) As the editors of the Complete Prose Works observe, the comparison of ministers to Egyptian locusts, and of their learning to the smoke from the bottomless pit, had become a standard feature of mid-century polemic (3: 258n.234).57 For this interpretation of Revelation 9.2-3, the Geneva Bible is undoubtedly responsible, for it glosses the verses as referring to "false teachers, heretikes, a[n]d worldlie suttil Prelates, with Mo[n]kes, Freres, Cardinales Patriarkes, Archebishops, Bishops, Doctors Bachelers &amp; masters which forsake Christ to mainteine false doctrine." There are two representations of the Egyptian plague locusts in Paradise Lost. in Book 1, they appear in a simile for the fallen angels, hovering in infernal darkness after emerging from the burning lake: As when the potent Rod Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile: So numberless were those bad Angels seen © 2007 The Author.

(1.338-46) The simile is at first surprising, as typology would dictate that the plague locusts are a type of the "bad Angels" swarming in Hell. That is, the simile seems to declare the antitype to be like the type. But of course in terms of Milton's portrait of the fallen angels, the plague locusts are the antitype. The apparent reversal of type and antitype calls subtle attention to the fictiveness of Milton's portrait. Like Raphael, he reminds us that he is "lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, / As may express them best" (PL 5.573-74). The simile's insistence on the darkness produced by the plague locusts ("pitchy cloud," "[l]ike Night," "darken'd all the Land") may be set in the context of well-known early modern accounts of locust invasions, which note that the first sign of the approach of Locusta migratoria is an effect on the light. The Portuguese priest Francisco Alvares, who witnessed a plague of locusts when he traveled to Ethiopa in the early sixteenth century, writes: "Their comming into the countrie is knowne a day before: not for that we can see them, but we know it by the sunne, who is yellow of colour [. . .] by reason of the light which reflecteth from their wings"; as they draw closer, "one may hardlie discerne the sunne" (Pory 352). He seems to describe a darkness that is yellow, a visible darkness. Locusts appear again in Michael's account of the Egyptian plagues in Book 12. What the plague of hail "devours not," he states, Herb or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes. (184-88) The implied threat of the infernal locusts in Book 1 has begun to be realized here, as darkness extends its empire over earth. Locusts act as night's agents, razing, as darkness does, vital color. Yet "three dayes" points to the temporary nature of the locusts' triumph—and to another apparent but temporary triumph of infernal darkness (Matt. 27.45). Beyond the Crucifixion, in the unknowable future, yet another temporary victory is foreshadowed by the "darksom Cloud." We recall the term "re-involve" in the prophetic prayer that ends Of Reformation. Yet Revelation 9.5 strictly limits (to "five months") the earthly reign of the monstrous locusts emerging from the bottomless pit. The contrast between the apocalyptic horror and the human scale of its duration finally reduces even the infernal locusts to size.

Reproduced by permission of the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. Just as "the Oxe corrupteth into Bees, or the Horse into hornets," so "the corrupt and excrementous humors in man are animated into lyce," Thomas Browne declares in a discussion of spontaneous generation (PE 1: 144). His matter of fact association of lice and human beings points to the lousiness of the early modern period. Lice are regarded as inseparable from the fallen human condition.58 Thomas Mouffet imagines human life in the garden of Eden, "whilest man was in his innocency," as being free from lice as well as from wickedness (Theatrum 1090). When man "was seduced by the wickednesse of that great and cunning deceiver, and proudly affected to know as much as God knew," Mouffet says with some feeling, "God humbled him with divers diseases, and divers sorts of Worms, with Lice, Hand-worms, Belly-worms, others call Termites, small Nits, and Acares" (Theatrum 1090). Samuel Pepys, having "itched mightily these six or seven days" in January 1669, asks his wife to "look my shirt," whereupon she finds "in my head and body above 20 lice, little and great, which I wonder at, being more than I have had I believe almost these 20 years" (9: 424). Three of Pepys's diary entries refer to the nit-infested wigs sold by "Jarvas the barber" (5: 212; 8: 133, 146), evidently a source of literal and figura tive irritation to Pepys. On the other hand, on an overnight journey into Som erset, Pepys records of the company: "Up finding our beds good but we lousy. Which made us merry we set out" (9: 231 [12 June 1668]). Lice are a source of humor in Prolusion 6, when likening members of his audience to the dishes ostensibly being served, Milton warns against eating crane like Irish birds—presumably a reference to some of the King brothers, notes © 2007 The Author.

(CW 12: 236) This is a novel and rare, rather than wholesome dish, and I would therefore warn you not to taste them, for they are very apt, if our epicure is right, to produce lice (CPW 1: 281) That these are inguinal lice emphasizes the adolescent nature of the humor.59 Lice have very different tonal value when they appear in Paradise Lost, Book 12, in Michael's account of the Egyptian plagues. The archangel explains to Adam that God, "by Signes and Judgements dire," will compel Pharoah to recognize God's message (175). "Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill / With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land" (177-78).60 Milton's term land captures both the enormity of the invasion and the connection of the invaders to the earth. In the account at Exodus 8.17, "Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt." God uses the creatures as instruments not only of punishment but also of enlightenment. In their number and their origin, observes James Norhnberg, the lice "reflect God's creative activ ity" and demonstrate anew that he "can give life to dust" (209). Robert Hooke's discussion and illustration of a magnified louse in Micrographia significantly extends the representational range of the little parasite.61 Even the topos of praising God's tiny creatures had rarely included Pediculus humanus.62 Hooke's work changed that. The chapter begins in the humorous vein typical of much louse-banter: "This is a Creature so officious, that 'twill be known to every one at one time or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will be intruding it self in every ones company." It is indeed so common, Hooke continues, that he could be exempted from making further comment on it, "did not [. . .] my Microscope, bring me other information of it" (211; see figure 3). He then proceeds to describe the ways in which the creature's body is adapted for life among human hairs. The louse has no eyelids, he notes; "to secure these eyes from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it passes, it has two horns that grow before it, in the place where one would have thought the eyes should be" (211-12). At the end of each leg, its two unequal sized claws "could not be made more commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these requisite motions, of walking and climb ing up the hair of a man's head, then it is" (212).63 He then explains, with diagrams, how the smaller claw can bend to grasp a hair or stay out of the way so the louse can walk easily along the skin. Thersites's insult, "I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus" (Tro. 5.1.53-54), loses some of its sting after Hooke's praise of the louse's remarkable adaptation for survival on the human body. Hans Zinsser even spares a moment's thought for the louse whose host is ill (if not with leprosy, then with typhus): "To the louse, we are the dreaded emissaries of death" (125).

I.e. 7 In the Middle Ages, skylarks were kept in cages as songbirds, the bestiaries explaining that their name, alauda, comes from laude, "praise" (George and Yapp 180-81). 8 For the Daulian bird, see Ovid 1: 334 (Met. 6.668-74). 9 Both woodlark (Lullula arborea) and skylark (Alauda arvensis) nest on the ground (see Burton, Field Guide 210-11). This ground-nesting is of particular interest to Aristotle (see HA 2: 222, 11: 264, 290). 1(1 There is greater critical controversy about the referent of the next lines: "Then to com in spight of sorrow, / And at my window bid good morrow, / Through the Sweet-Briar, or the Vine, / Or the twisted Eglantine" (45-48). Who comes to the window—the lark? L'Allegro? dawn? Carey summa rizes the controversy and observes that "grammar and the habits of larks" work against the bird (CSP, "L'Allegro," 45-46n). 11 See PL 7.27-30 and Darbishire 33 and 194. 12 The other Latin name for leech is sanguisuga, "blood-sucker." 13 The editors of the NOAB note that the meaning of the Hebrew word translated "horseleach" in the Authorized and Geneva Bibles is uncertain (Prov. 30.15n).The medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, has three jaws and makes a Y-shaped incision in its host (Mann 9-10). 14 Native to Europe and parts of Asia, the medicinal leech began to decline in England in the mid-seventeenth century. It survives today in "relatively undeveloped areas such as the New Forest, the Lake District, South Wales, Anglesey, and Islay, Scotland" (Mann 5). Popular etymology is in all likelihood mistaken in assuming that leech meaning a doctor (or, more precisely in the seventeenth century, a veterinarian) is a transferred use of leech meaning the aquatic, bloodsucking worm. See the OED's etymological descriptions of the two words (s.v. leech, sb.1, and leech, sb.2). Zoologists acknowledge that much is still unknown or not understood about leeches and are fascinated by such peculiar features as its "gut with no digestive enzymes [. . .] and fertilization carried out by intro ducing the sperms through the body wall of another animal" (Mann 1). 15 The tract was part of a several-pronged response to John Owen and those who were attempting to exclude anti-trinitarians from toleration. Roger Williams coordinated the opposition to Owen, which included Milton, Henry Vane, and Marchamont Nedham. I am indebted to Martin Dzelzainis for this information. 16 The NOAB editors note that the beast "represents the Roman empire" (Rev. 13.1-18n).The 1560 Geneva Bible glosses it as both ancient and papal Rome. The argument of Zeal Examined, that the leopard is zealous against those he names idolaters, responds to Revelation's emphasis on the beast's utterances: "And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven" (13.6).The pamphlet thus implies that the denouncing of blasphemy by the ungodly is itself a blasphemy. © 2007 The Author. Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="27">248 Karen Edwards 17 The editors of the NOAB note that the beast from the sea is a combination of the beasts seen in Daniel's vision (Dan. 7.3-8), and that the "four-headed winged leopard" represents the Persian empire (Dan. 7.4-8n). In the annotation to line 19 of his Pindaric Ode to Hobbes, Cowley states that the leopard of Daniel's vision represents the Grecian empire (120n43). In the Old Testament, the leopard as a beast of prey is symbolically represented as punishing Israel. See, for instance, Jer. 5.6, Hos. 13.7, and Hab. 1.8.The Sinai leopard (Panthera pardus jarvisi) is now classified as critically at risk (Macdonald 28-29). 18 See OED, s.v. ounce, lynx. In more recent centuries, jaguars and pumas have been called leopards (Macdonald 28). 19 The "Keeper of the Lions and Leopardes" was paid "6d. per diem [. . .] for their sustenance, and three half pence a day" for his own, reports Howell (24). 20 r Indeed, the popular confusion between leopard and panther persists today, due largely to the presence of melanism in the leopard population, a variation or aberration that results in an entirely black coat. "The name 'Black panther' is sometimes erroneously applied to such animals in the belief that they are a distinct species" (Macdonald 28). In modern scientific terminology, Panthera names a genus (formerly Felis), not a species. What Macdonald calls "the pantherine lineage" consists of twenty-three species (8). The leopard is Panthera pardus-, the lion, Panthera leo\ the tiger, Panthera tigris\ and so on. In fact, the extremely complex genetic and physiological relationships among members of the cat family (.Felidae) have not yet been fully worked out. 21 r The OED defines libard as an obsolete form of leopard (s.v. libard(e), libardesse), and lihbard (s.v. libbard) as an archaic variant.The "now archaic or poetic" pard is defined as a leopard or panther (s.v. pard1); the obsolete term pardal (s.v. pardal), last recorded in 1661, may also signify either a leopard or panther but is more usually identified with the leopard when the two beasts are being distinguished. Panther is defined by the OED simply as another name for the leopard (s.v. panther). However, in a lengthy note to the definition, the editors explain that for centuries panther was used to distinguish an exceptionally large kind of leopard from ordinary leopards (a distinction without scientific basis). The assumed difference between panthers and leopards, they speculate, stems from the existence of two relevant Latin names, panthera and pardus. The former was believed to derive from pan, "all," and thera, "beast," a derivation giving rise, as the OED puts it, to "many fancies and fables." The panther does not have a presence in Milton's works. (For panther lore, see Isidore 92-94; George and Yapp 53; White 14-17; and Baxter 49-50.) Other scholars believe that the ancient names themselves arose from the assumption that differences in coat coloration and body size indicated different animals when, in scientific terms, they indicate species variation due to differences in habitat. (See Macdonald 28; Dorst and Dandelot 145.) 22 For its name, see Isidore 94-97. For figural interpretation of its coat, see OED, s.v. spotted, a. and ppl.a., def. 2. Thus, Lysander calls Demetrius "this spotted and inconstant man" for pursuing and then abandoning Helena (MND 1.1.110). By the second half of the seventeenth century, this figural reading of the leopard's spotted coat existed side by side with a new appreciation of the coat's functionality and beauty. In a discussion of filaments and hair in Micrographia (1665), Robert Hooke states that the "Teguments" of animals are "adapted to the peculiar use and convenience of that Animal which they inwrap" but also, aided by color, contribute to their "ornament and beauty," most obviously in the "cloathings" of "Leopards, Cats, Rhein Deer" (159-60). Modern zoologists confirm this reputation for guile: leopards "employ a combination of oppor tunism, stealth, and speed. They are masters of concealment" (Macdonald 28). 24 Underlying Walker's condemnation is the ancient assumption that leopards, like mules, cannot reproduce. 25 See George and Yapp 48, Lloyd 47, Loisel: 1: 155, and Thomas 277, who cites A Pleasant Funeral-Oration, at the Interment of the Three (Lately Deceased) Tower-Lyons (1681), which speaks of the "Tower-Lyons" as "the darlings, the delight of the people" (sig. A). The pamphlet is a political satire, and its "lions" are not beasts, but clearly the satire hinges on the popularity of both kinds of lions. © 2007 The Author.

Petrarch refers not to a raised paw but a raised horn ("contra' tuoi fondatori alzi le corna"), thus likening a corrupt Pope to the Beast of the Apocalypse (see Dan. 7.8). Milton cites the same sonnet earlier in Of Reformation (CPW 1: 559) and seems to allude to it in a letter to Charles Dati in 1647 (CPW 2: 764). He refers to a different line from the same sonnet in Of True Religion (CPW 8: 421). 35 See, for instance, the Geneva Bible gloss on 2 Tim. 4.17. 36 Milton may also glance here at non-apocalyptic visions of animal companionship. Walter Charleton reports that he has seen a lamb and wolf "brought, by Custom" to "great familiarity." Moreover, "the like Kindness have we very lately observed betwixt a Lamb and Lyon of the Lord Generall Cromwells, kept at Sion house, and afterward publickly shewed in London" (362). 37 In the "proper" language of the hart, hart and hind are beasts of the forest. Here they are "Of [. . .] the Forrest," and the lion is the beast in the woods. 38 Mark's account is itself based on Old Testament prophecies such as Ezek. 34.25 and Isa. 65.25. 39 See Carey, CSP, PR 1.310-13n, and Pope 108-10. 4" Spenser combines the heraldic lion with the fawn in a way reminiscent of Milton's combining the heraldic lion with the kid in PL 4.343-44.

The identification between Samson and Hercules is at the bottom of a dispute reported by Thomas Browne: "Whether Hercules be more properly described strangling then tearing the Lion, as Victorius hath disputed" (PE 1: 417).

See Bodenheimer 309-24 for the Orthoptem of Palestine. 44 Modern entomology confirms Browne's equation of grasshoppers and locusts: "Locusts are large grasshoppers with strong powers of flight. From time to time their populations explode and vast swarms emigrate from the population centres, causing enormous damage to crops wherever they land" (Chinery 75). 45 The cicada belongs to the order Hemiptera, the locust, to the order Orthoptera (Chinery 97—125, 68-76). 46 Enquiry has now produced the fact that one species of European cicada, Cicadetta montana, is found in Britain. Chinery notes that "it is confined to the New Forest and particularly associated with hazel trees, it has a much softer song than the larger cicadas" (117). "The Migratory Locust (Locusta migratoria) is resident in southern Europe but it does not often build up to dangerous numbers there" (Chinery 75). 47 The grasshopper does not have true teeth but rather biting jaws, necessary for cutting the vegetation on which it feeds. Cicadas, on the other hand, are sap-suckers, with a long "beak" (Chinery 68, 117). 48 Mouffet provides a comprehensive list of locust plagues (Theatrum 986-87). Alciato bases an emblem, "Nil reliqui" ("Nothing Left"), on a plague of locusts that devastated Northern Italy in the early 1540s (139). 49 See Marcus 229-33 and Edwards 241-44, 247-48 for the political implications of the grasshopper in Thomas Stanley, "The Grasshopper XLII1" (94), Abraham Cowley, "The Grasshopper" (10-11), Richard Lovelace, "The Grass-hopper (38), and (for a contrast to Cavalier representations) Andrew Marvell, Upon Appleton House (227). 50 "The Joyes of Earth and Ayre are thine intire, / That with thy feet and wings dost hop and flye," says Richard Lovelace in "The Grass-hopper," proceeding to identify the creature with the sun (i.e., Apollo): "Up with the day, the Sun thou welcomst then, / Sportst in the guilt-plats of his Beames, / And all these merry dayes mak'st merry men, / They selfe, and Melancholy streames" (38). Lovelace's grasshopper/poet is finally threatened by "the Sickle," the wintry and puritanical forces that crop golden ears and kingly heads. There is no hint that the grasshopper has been improvident, merely unfortunate, and the speaker proposes waiting indoors until the sun resumes its reign. 51 Andrew Marvell offers a more direct resistance. The grasshoppers of stanza 47 of Upon Appleton House allude to the metaphoric grasshoppers of Num. 13.33: "And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight." Men also seem to be grasshoppers in Marvell's poem, but the grasshoppers are giants— gigantic, no doubt, from gorging themselves on the meadow's lush grass, and though gigantic, still insects. They have no song but only a "squeking Laugh"; they mock and condemn the men walking "more low" than they are. But humility is a virtue, and these grasshoppers are arrogant. The guilty scythe that in Lovelace's poem threatens "innocent" grasshoppers is in Marvell's poem the productive and leveling scythe of the Mowers, who walk through the grass like the Hebrew people through the Red Sea. Barbara Everett sees in Marvell's grasshoppers not only an allusion to Num. 13.33 but also to "a source more lustrous and classical," i.e., the Phaedrus, in which Socrates explains that cicadas are messengers of the Muses (74). Her reading, however, depends precisely upon the confusion that Browne addresses in Pseudodoxia Epidemica and hence misses Marvell's subtle undermining of the Cavalier grasshopper. 52 The poem was published with its Latin compamon poem, Locustae, in 1627.

There is some uncertainty about the nature of the invasion being described in Joel. Is it an actual locust plague figuratively described as an army, or vice versa? See NOAB, Joel 1.207n; and Andinach. 54 Horses and locusts are associated at Job 39.20, when God asks Job whether he can "make him [the horse] afraid as a grasshopper." 55 Enlarged hind legs, modified for jumping, are characteristic of the order Othoptera, which includes crickets as well as grasshoppers and locusts. "Some entomologists advocate dropping the name Orthoptera in favour of Saltatoria," notes Chinery (68). "&gt;f,John Taylor is largely responsible for producing spurious Puritan outbursts against "shag-poll locusts" in a series of pamphlets published in 1641. See Edwards 238-41. 57 Samuel Richardson "represented the smoke from the bottomless pit of Rev 9:2 as 'the learning of the Ministers. [. . .] This smoke [. . .] is a vaile over men's eyes that they cannot see by reason of it"' (cited in CPW 3: 258n234). For discussion of other contexts in which locusts figure as "false preachers and heretics," see the concise list in Fowler, PL 1.338-44n. 58 See Zinsser, whose thesis is that the louse, in its role as convector of typhus fever, has had over the centuries a profound impact on the course of human history. 59 John Hale's translation captures the nature of the humor rather better than the one appearing in the Complete Prose Works: "Now these are a new dish, rare rather than wholesome in fact. Take my advice, abstain: if our food-taster has got it right, these are the best food for giving you lice, in the balls" (89). 60 Zinsser remarks of the plague of lice that "a louseborne disease like typhus may be suspected, though in view of the absence of historical data concerning typhus elsewhere at this period, this is most unlikely" (81). Modern translations of the Bible tend to prefer "gnats" of Exod. 8.16-18 to the "lice" of the KJV and the Geneva Bible. As the editors of the NOAB note, "From ancient times stinging gnats or mosquitoes have plagued Egypt, especially in the autumn. The Nile, receding from its overflow, leaves stagnant pools of water in which the insects breed" (Exod. 8.16-32n). 61 The human louse seems to have evolved from bird lice (Mallophaga, i.e., biting lice) to become a parasitical bloodsucker (see Zinsser 125-27 and Chinery 94). Chinery states: "The evolution of lice has gone hand in hand with that of their hosts [. . .] [Thus] the lice of man and apes are much more closely related to each other than they are to those of rodents, paralleling the relationships of the host animals themselves" (94). Zinsser comments: "In a manner, therefore, by adapting itself to parasitism, the louse has attained the ideal of bourgeois civilization, though its methods are more direct than those of business or banking, and its source of nourishment is not its own species" (127). 62 There are two kinds of human louse, the Head Louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) and the Body Louse (P.h. humanus), which some scientists regard as two distinct species, as they "keep very much to their respective parts of our anatomy" (Chinery 96). 63 "The claws of some lice are so well adapted for gripping the hair of the host that they are unable to attach themselves to other hosts whose hairs are of different diameters" (Chinery 94). © 2007 The Author.
