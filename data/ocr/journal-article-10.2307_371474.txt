<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LADY AND THE TEMPLE the critical essays, may appear only im- plicitly in Miss Porter's fiction, its limita- tion curiously suggests a possible restric- tion of her total appeal. "All the con- scious and recollected years of my life," she writes in the 1940 Preface to Flower- ing Judas, "have been lived to this day under the heavy threat of world catas- trophe, and most of the energies of my mind and spirit have been spent in the effort to grasp the meaning of these threats, to trace them to their sources and to understand the logic of this ma- jestic and terrible failure of life in the Western World." But these efforts to un- derstand the failure of life in the Western world, however important they may be in her heart and mind, could hardly be said to be the major subject of her art. Indeed, her writing--imaginative and critical-seems more nearly an attempt to escape from the central problem. Per- haps the reason that her work, for all its beauty, does not etch itself indelibly on our consciousness is that it ultimately does not illuminate the supreme tragedy of which she speaks. Thus, whatever may be the acuity, the vitality, and even the nicely calculated violence of some of her stories, and whatever may be the strength of her utterance in other fields, she may continue to be regarded essentially as a lovely, white-robed priestess of the shrine of Apollo-a role that she seems deliber- ately and expertly to have written for herself. Of Gods and Men in the "Iliad" WALLACE L. ANDERSON1 THE introduction of general education programs in many colleges has given large numbers of students their first taste of classical literature. For many students this experience is disappointing and frustrating; it is neither meaningful nor pleasurable. Homer's Iliad is a case in point. The difficulty is not primarily one of translation, for, even if the poem were to be read in the original, the funda- mental problem would remain. The prob- lem is one of belief. The gods and their relations with men play a basic part in the Iliad from the beginning to the end. In the Invocation Homer calls upon the Muse to sing of the wrath of Achilles and the destruction it brought in fulfilment of the will of Zeus. At the very begin- Iowa State Teachers College.

It is this mythological world of gods that is incredible to the moder reader, and yet this is precisely what must, in some sense, be believed if the Iliad is to be read with understanding and pleasure. To recapture the original belief of the ancient Greeks is impossible. Yet it is possible to understand the na- ture and function of the gods as Homer uses them artistically in the poem. And once the Iliad becomes artistically credi- ble, it also becomes an experience which is both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying. The most obvious feature of Homer's gods is that they are anthropomorphic. They are "human" to a large degree: Thetis weeps when she sees Achilles sor- rowing; Zeus laughs as he watches the 391</page><page sequence="2">COLLEGE ENGLISH gods matched against each other in bat- tle with the Trojans and the Achaeans; Poseidon is jealous because of the wall the Achaeans built and angry because no hecatomb was offered to him; Ares and Aphrodite are wounded and run to Zeus, complaining and seeking sympathy. In these instances and many others the gods exhibit traits and feelings which are de- cidedly human. Moreover, the organiza- tion of the gods is patterned after a hu- man model. Zeus is the monarch and acknowledged head of all the gods. He has his assembly and asks advice and discusses plans; yet his will ultimately is law. Each of the gods has his region to rule and certain duties and responsibili- ties. Peace and harmony do not always reign among the gods. Like men, they have their quarrels and squabbles. They sulk, feel offended, and are afraid. Homer at one point presents a laughable picture of the lame Hephaistos acting as peace- maker, limping about trying to reconcile the gods. Often the gods appear ridicu- lous. Perhaps the best example of this, made more amusing by a slight touch of irony, occurs when Hera beguiles Zeus. Arrayed in all her splendor, she arouses the desire of Zeus. He, in Don Juan fash- ion, relates all his previous amours and tells her that she by far surpasses them all. His discomfiture at being deceived is all the more amusing because he was tricked at his own game. By means of this humanization of the gods Homer heightens the interest of the poem. Be- cause the gods are "human" they obtain greater sympathy and understanding from the audience. Moreover, it is im- possible not to compare the subjects of Zeus with those of Agamemnon. When there is dissension among the Achaeans, it is understandable and partially excus- able, for even the gods act in the same way. The reverse is even more true- when there is disunity among the gods it is understandable, for the gods have human traits, and this is the way human beings behave. There is another side of the gods, how- ever, which plays an especially important part in the poem. Although they have some human qualities, they are of course not completely human. In order really to be gods they must be more than men; they must be sublime and superhuman. The gods may be wounded in battle, but they are always immortal. Thus the transience of mortals is emphasized. The gods are omniscient and ubiquitous. They know all before it happens and even, in the case of Zeus, decree what is to happen. The control of the lives of mankind is very much in the hands of the gods. Moreover, the gods are capable of miraculous deeds. Not only do they move from place to place with the speed of light, but they can appear visibly or invisibly as they will. They send omens and answer prayers according to their desires. Hera causes Achilles' horses to weep and gives them speech to foretell the doom of Achilles. Apollo marvelously makes a bridgeway so the Trojans can cross the ditch which the Achaeans had dug. Although the miraculous actions of the gods add variety and interest, there is another aspect concerning the gods which is of prime importance. The Iliad is a moral tragedy, and it is the gods to a large extent that are responsible for both the moral tone and the tragic effect of the poem. Although the gods themselves often are capricious and deceitful, they nevertheless demand among men strict adherence to oaths, proper regard for and mercy to suppliants, respect for the aged and for the dead, and obedience to the gods. There are some actions among men that may show lack of alS&amp;s, respect, but 392</page><page sequence="3">OF GODS AND MEN IN THE "ILIAD" violations of the rules mentioned above represent iD5pts, overweening arrogance and lack of respect toward the gods, which is punishable by &amp;Tr.2 This moral code was generally recognized. In the Iliad the turning points of the action center upon violations of these ethical obligations. Initially Agamemnon brings the plague upon the Achaeans because he has been guilty of OiSpls, in disregarding and shamefully treating Chryses, who came bearing the fillet of Apollo. Achilles in his argument with Agamem- non is guilty of lack of al&amp;ws to Agamem- non, who rules by divine authority as symbolized by his scepter. Agamemnon, on the other hand, is guilty of the same thing from the opposite point of view- lack of respect to a subordinate. But when Achilles refuses to be reconciled, he is not only guilty of al&amp;s but also of vjfpLt, for he has shown no mercy to the embassy who came to him as suppliants. The idea of 5VpLs coupled with the control of the gods over men can lead to some ironic situations, and Homer uses them with telling effect. For instance, when Menelaos and Paris duel to deter- mine victory for the Achaeans or the Trojans, they swear an oath to abide by the outcome. Menelaos wins when Paris is spirited away by Aphrodite, and the Trojans are about to concede complete victory to the Achaeans. Hera, however, had other plans. Therefore she plotted beforehand to have the Trojans break the oath. Zeus agreed, and in due time Pandaros violates the oath. Even though the gods decreed it, nevertheless Pan- daros is guilty of iv3ps. This is not the only case in which the gods intervene in human affairs. In fact, 2 For a fuller discussion of these ethical principles see C. M. Bowra, Tradition and Design in the "Iliad" (New York: Oxford University Press, 1930), pp. 18-19. intervention by the gods is an integral part of the poem and an effective part of Homer's method. At every crucial mo- ment the gods step in. The breaking of the oath by Pandaros was necessary in order to have the action continue. Achilles' wrath had not yet been fulfilled. When Patroklos in Achilles' armor chases the Trojans back to the city, he attempts to take the walls and might well have succeeded except for the inter- vention of Apollo. Added plausibility is given to events when the gods appear in the guise of friends or acquaintances of another person. Thus in Agamemnon's dream it is Nestor, his sage counselor, who advises him to do battle. Pandaros is persuaded to violate the oath by Ante- nor's son Laodokos. Hector, just before being killed, is encouraged because he thinks his brother Deiphobos is helping him. It is only too late that he realizes that he has been duped by Athene. Achilles, in the preceding action, is tricked in a similar manner. Just as Achilles is about to storm the Trojan walls, Apollo appears. Achilles pursues, and Apollo keeps up the deception long enough for the Trojan army to get safely within the walls of the city. It has been often said that the Greeks were not concerned with suspense in their narratives. In a sense this is true of the Iliad. The final outcome and the general plot are known beforehand. At the hands of a poor poet the Iliad might have been nothing but a boring, monoto- nous recital of legendary events of a past age. Yet there is suspense in the Iliad, and in Homer's handling of it his creative genius and poetic insight are revealed. Because the outcome is known the em- phasis and interest are shifted to the "how" and "when" events are going to happen. The device of the intervention of the gods not only makes for plausibility 393</page><page sequence="4">COLLEGE ENGLISH and continuation of the action but fur- ther complicates the action and adds un- expectedness, surprise, and inner sus- pense from moment to moment. Even if the will of Zeus is ordained and even if the gods are expected to intervene, nevertheless it is not always known just when they will step in and, when they do, which side they will take. Homer achieves a tremendous dramatic effect in having Paris removed from the field of battle by Aphrodite, in having Hephais- tos come to Achilles' aid when he is desperately fighting the Scamander Riv- er, and in having Hermes lead the aged Priam safely through the Achaeans to Achilles. That tragedy is always much more poignant when it is unexpected Homer was well aware. At the turning point of the poem he achieves an intensity of pathos and tragedy which is almost over- whelming. The audience has been warned of the coming death of Patroklos, but Achilles has every reason to believe that all will be well. Thetis had obtained the promise of Zeus that Achilles should have revenge. All was going according to plan; the Achaeans were on their knees and desperately in need of him. When Achilles sends Patroklos out, he offers a prayer to Zeus for the success of the mis- sion. Zeus hears but grants the prayer in part only. The Trojans are pushed back, but Patroklos loses his life. It is this event which changes the course of the poem. And it is the effect on Achilles which is important. If the audience had not been told earlier that Patroklos was to die, Achilles' reaction would have been an anticlimax. To Achilles, Patroklos' death is much more tragic because of the unexpected action on the part of Zeus. To the gods the life of men is to be pitied. Zeus, on seeing Achilles' horses weeping for the death of Patroklos, re- marks to himself, "Of all things that breathe and creep about upon the earth, there is nothing more piteous than man."3 In a sense this is true of Homer's men, and the gods may well think that the lot of mortals is a sad one. So it is. Their lives are for the most part con- trolled by the gods. Occasionally there seems to be a power even more omnipo- tent than Zeus-Fate, who from the be- ginning numbered the days of men. Hec- tor in parting from Andromache at- tempts to comfort her by saying, "No man shall hurl me to Hades against my fate; but no man, be he a coward or a courageous man, has escaped Fate once he has been born."4 It is small assur- ance, however, either to Hector or to his wife. Apollo, speaking of Achilles, further emphasizes the power of Fate: "Later he shall endure whatever Fate span for him with her thread, at the outset, when his mother gave birth to him."5 From birth to death, then, men's lives are in the hands of the gods. Any man might well be pessimistic in such a situa- tion. Yet the men Homer creates are men of heroic stature. Often they go into battle fighting against gods. The odds are all against them, yet they manage to fight on. Even if no gods are actively op- posing them, nevertheless it may have been decreed beforehand that their op- ponent should win. At one point in the battle, after Diomedes has been wounded, Odysseus is left alone to face the onslaught. He knows that Zeus is aiding the Trojans, yet he chides himself: "But why do I argue with myself? For I know that those who flee from battle are cowards, but whoever is a hero in war must stand valiantly, whether he kill or be killed."6 8 Book XVII. 4 Book VI. 5 Book XX. ' Book XI. 394</page><page sequence="5">OF GODS AND MEN IN THE "ILIAD" When Hector realizes that he has been deceived by Athene and learns that his brother Deiphobos is not helping him, he knows that his end is near: "Now death approaches me; it is not far off, and there is no way of escape. Such must have been the pleasure of Zeus and his far-darting son, who formerly came to my aid. But now my fate has found me."7 Ordinarily a man in such a situation might have gone to pieces on the spot. On the contrary, Hector's stature rises with his approaching death. With certain doom before him, he says, "At least let me not die ingloriously without a strug- gle, but in some feat of arms of which future generations shall hear."8 This sense of impending doom forecast by the gods is used as a background against which all the action of the Iliad takes place. Nowhere is it more evident than in Homer's portrayal of Achilles. Achilles knows that his life is to be a short one. The tragedy of his wrath and its wasteful destruction are intensified by this knowledge. Achilles knows that he is to die shortly after Hector dies, yet he himself kills Hector to avenge his friend Book XXII. 8 Ibid. Patroklos, and thereby hastens his own death. Achilles would not have saved Hector to lengthen his own life, but even had he wished to do so it would have been impossible; for Zeus, just before the duel, took up his golden scales, and there was no alternative. It was Hector's fated day. The gods in the Iliad are not extrane- ous figures placed there merely for the sake of variety or imaginative flights, though Homer does make the most of this. They are woven deeply into the tex- ture of the poem, and they serve a mul- tiple function. By means of the gods Homer has strengthened the structure and unity of the work, has given it an ethical tone and color, and has height- ened the tragedy. He has given added plausibility to events, created surprise and suspense, and complicated the ac- tion. And in portraying the gods as he did, superhuman yet in many respects like men, Homer also created heroes, men in many respects like gods. Once the function of the gods is understood, the problem of belief is resolved and the Iliad becomes artistically credible and satisfying.
