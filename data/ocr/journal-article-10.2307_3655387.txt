<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES L. BRIGGS Department of Ethnic Studies University of California, San Diego Why Nation-States and Journalists Can't Teach People to Be Healthy: Power and Pragmatic Miscalculation in Public Discourses on Health For Feliciana This article analyzes how Venezuelan public health officials collaborated with journalists in producing information about cholera in January- December 1991. It uses Michael Warner's (2002) observation that such public discourse involves a contradiction: it must project the image of reaching an actually existing public at the same time that it creates multiple publics as it circulates. The analysis explores the language ideologies that hide complex sets of practices, networks, and material conditions that shape how public discourses circulate. At the same time that epidemi- ologists targeted poor barrio residents, street vendors offood and drink, and indigenous people as being "at high risk, " health education messages pictured women in well-equipped kitchens demonstrating cholera prevention measures. The gap between these ideal audiences and the discrepant publics created by their circulation limited the effectiveness of prevention efforts and created a substantial chasm between public health institutions and the publics they sought to reach. [public discourse, epidemics, health education, social inequality, Latin America] ow should we understand the concept of "public" that is embedded in no- tions of "public health"? Although care is often taken to define the concept of "health," "public" seems to be relegated more frequently to common- sense understandings. It is contrasted, of course, with individual, thereby distin- guishing clinical medicine from public health. It is often equated with "society" in general, or all of the people who live in a particular political unit.' This range of meanings seems to emerge from a central narrative that informs discussions of pub- lic health-the idea that 19th-century epidemics of infectious diseases induced North American and European nations to undertake a sanitary revolution. According to this account, these countries were spared from epidemics of cholera and other epidemic diseases that continued to plague other regions by a new type of relationship MedicalAnthropology Quarterly 17(3):287-321.

As Charles Rosenberg (1962) and other researchers have articulated, the nation-state came to define the task of protecting the health of citizens as one of its basic functions, and permanent institutions were established to provide technologies and infrastructures for environmental sanitation and for con- ducting disease surveillance and control. The narrative also suggests that the public accepted responsibility for adopting hygienic practices, ordering domestic spaces, and abdicating authority over disease prevention and treatment to health profes- sionals. As a number of writers suggest, the state assumed the right and the duty to bring members of racialized and immigrant communities-who were seen as being ignorant of or rejecting hygiene and institutional medicine-under the scope of this revolution (see Kraut 1994; Rosenberg 1962; Shah 2001). The state thus claimed pri- mary responsibility for producing what I have referred to as sanitary citizens (see Briggs with Mantini-Briggs 2003), individuals who (1) conceive of the body, health, and disease in terms of medical epistemologies; (2) adopt hygienic practices for disciplining their own bodies and interacting with others; (3) and recognize the monopoly of the medical profession in defining modes of disease prevention and treatment. Other individuals became what I refer to as unsanitary subjects-persons who were expected to have failed to internalize medicalized epistemologies, bodily practices, and deferral to health professionals. Their bodies and domestic spaces were subject to what Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein (1997) refer to as de- privatization, such that the state could inspect their homes at will and attempt to transform bodily, culinary, child-care, and other practices. In visits to their homes, public health nurses identified health as a key dimension of the process of trans- forming immigrants into citizens. Once the germ theory of disease began to gain acceptability among public health professionals, Judith Walzer Leavitt (1996) suggests that the state incarcer- ated Mary Mallon ("Typhoid Mary") for more than three decades as a means of im- pressing on the public the obligations of citizens in the new biomedical order. The sanitary revolution thus placed public health at the center of how the state and citi- zenship came to be defined at the same time that it imagined the public as divided into distinct types of individuals and groups on the grounds of health. P. Stanley Yoder (1997) has suggested that when health education forms part of international health programs, the construction of populations as responding to cultural norms that impede the assimilation of scientific knowledge can be extended to entire so- cieties. L. W. Green (1999) traces the shift in attempts by the state to educate the pub- lic in health following World War II. He suggests that as biomedical technologies became the focus, health education came to be seen as a means of enhancing the public's knowledge and use of medical resources, thereby producing good con- sumers of health services. Beginning in 1974, however, a new emphasis on health promotion partially shifted the center of attention from the needs of public health institutions to those of populations. Enhancing community participation in public health has become an increasingly important focus (see Minkler and Wallerstein 2003). It is often suggested, however, that this is one of the main areas in which both states and publics have failed. In its influential The Future of Public Health, for example, the Institute of Medicine suggests that "this nation has lost sight of its public health goals and has allowed the system of public health activities to fall 288</page><page sequence="3">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH into disarray" (1988:1). Suggesting that "the content of public values and popular opinions" forms one of the two major factors that shape the way that public health issues are addressed and the success of such efforts, the report argues that the prob- lem lies not only in the need for more health-related knowledge on the part of members of the public but also in how they have lost trust in public health institutions. One institution that is often cited in explaining public perceptions of health and health institutions is the media. As Simon Chapman and Deborah Lupton (1994:25) observe, surveys often suggest that the media provides most people's major source of information about health. Nevertheless, Green (1999) suggests that the penchant of reporters for portraying medicine and public health negatively has fostered a skeptical attitude on the part of many members of the public. Writers such as Eva Benelli (2003) argue that journalists often pay undue attention to un- proven medical claims, thereby creating public pressure to shape public health policies and expenditures in problematic ways. In a study of radio programs that promote natural medicines in Ecuador, Ann Miles (1998) points out that the media can actually increase acceptance of consumerism and scientific authority under the guise of urging resistance to biomedical practices. Health officials (like other pub- lic figures) often complain in private that journalists distort their words, subject them to unfair criticism, and fail to report what is truly important.2 In an article that appeared in Public Health Reports, renowned science and health reporter Laurie Garrett responds to criticisms that reporters increase public panic, impede medical responses by rushing to the scene of emergencies, and politicize health issues- that is, that "the media are either enemies or troublesome fools that need to be cod- dled into dispersing helpful information against its better wisdom" (2001:88). She ar- gues, instead, for a relationship of mutual respect between public health officials and reporters. Nevertheless, neither the notion of ignorant, ambitious, careless, or skeptical journalists nor disrespectful and paranoid health professionals provide even the ru- diments of a framework that can be used in explaining how information circulates between biomedical institutions, the media, and public audiences or the problems that emerge from this relationship. My focus in this article is precisely on the way that received models of this process systematically misconstrue these discursive interactions. Language ideologies that construct how health professionals talk to reporters and how journalists pass messages along to the public fail to capture the status of this information as public discourse, as words and images directed not at circumscribed, copresent audiences but at strangers.3 I draw on a recent article by Michael Warner (2002) that develops a sophisticated understanding of the com- plex and contradictory character of public discourse: although its producers see themselves as speaking to "the public," a defined and knowable population, audi- ences for public discourse are produced by the circulation and reception of the dis- course and the material underpinnings that shape these practices. This contradiction between models and processes of discourse creates impor- tant obstacles to the circulation of health-related messages as they move between public health institutions, the media, and publics, often leading to the failure of programs that attempt to build public awareness of prevention, screening, and treatment efforts and even at times to widespread skepticism in some social sectors of all government health messages. Note that these debates about the role of the media in circulating health-related information deal primarily with questions of 289</page><page sequence="4">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY content-the extent to which media reports accurately convey biomedical knowl- edge and describe extant health conditions. My interest here is both with content and with process-the routes of circulation and the way that public health authori- ties and reporters often build models that project how messages ought to circulate and embed these projections into health-related information itself. Taking up questions of how public discourses are produced, circulated, and received opens up new vantage points on an issue that has received a great deal of discussion of late, that of health inequities. Works by such scholars as Paul Farmer (1992, 1999, 2003), Jim Yong Kim et al. (2000), Vicente Navarro (1998), and Richard G. Wilkinson (1996) point to the role of social inequality in shaping the distribution of morbidity and mortality within and between populations. What Farmer (1992) refers to as "geographies of blame," characterizations that blame ill health on individual and collective behavior and cognition, can draw attention away from questions of access to health services and institutional racism. The In- stitute of Medicine published a massive report that argues that racialized minorities in the United States-particularly African Americans and Latinos-receive infe- rior treatment as compared with Whites for a wide range of diseases, even when controlling for such factors as socioeconomic status and type of health insurance (Smedley et al. 2002). Tracing the way that public discourses about health are generated, circulated, and received goes beyond simply producing another means of showing how such inequalities are justified. It also suggests that multiple publics are created by these discourses, thereby making ideas about populations "at risk" and health inequali- ties seem natural. In the "mediated societies" in which we live (see Martin Barbero 1987), that is, where our notions of ourselves and even of society itself are shaped by media representations, deconstructing commonsense understandings of public discourses of health can better equip us to rethink "the public" in public health. My focus is on a 1991 program aimed at preventing a cholera epidemic in Venezuela. I draw on materials collected in the course of several years of research conducted collaboratively with Clara Mantini-Briggs, M.D. (see Briggs with Man- tini-Briggs 2003). Much of the focus of the larger study was on a rainforest area in eastern Venezuela in which some five hundred people categorized as indigenas (indigenous people) died from cholera in 1992-93. Hundreds of hours of inter- views were conducted in this area, nearby cities, Caracas, and other urban areas, and with public health institutions in the United States, Geneva (WHO), and else- where. This article analyzes a corpus of 221 articles that appeared in national newspapers starting in early February 1991 when the first cases were reported in Peru and the time that cholera was reported in the Venezuela by the press (Decem- ber 4, 1991). Sources also include interviews with public health officials and health education and promotion specialists, journalists, politicians, and members of vari- ous publics regarding official statements, health education, press coverage, and public reception. The Circulation of Public Discourses Research on the circulation of health-related information must contend with a number of complexities. These efforts are ordinarily generated in institutional con- texts, and they are most frequently associated with the state. How exactly does the 290</page><page sequence="5">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH state place material into public circulation? What are the dynamics that shape such information's shifting relationship to the state in the course of its discursive life? This process depends on what Louis Althusser (1971) termed interpellation. His celebrated example is of a policeman calling out: "Hey, you!" Insofar as we recog- nize ourselves as the person addressed by this statement and turn around, we are in- terpellated as the subject of state discourse. Information disseminated as a means of preventing infectious diseases entails the interpellation of members of popula- tions deemed to be "at risk," such that they interpret the discourse as being about them. How do health-related messages interpellate their audiences? What leads to interpellative misfires? Recent work on social suffering (see Kleinman et al. 1997) has emphasized the social and political-economic effects of different ways of representing the ex- perience of illness. The manner in which victims, villains, and heroes are narra- tively constructed grants political agency to some and silences or subordinates oth- ers. As these representations become public discourse, the pragmatic effects of the social images and attributions of agency they contain operate differently than, for example, in doctor-patient interactions. Their producers cannot determine in ad- vance the precise nature of this public, how information will reach it, how the dis- course will continue to circulate (if it indeed does), and the multiple ways that it will be received. Even authoritative messages are thus subject to a complex process that cannot be known in advance-no matter how much money and time are de- voted to attempts to determine routes of circulation and modes of reception. How, then, is the public that is entailed in the notion of public health constituted, and how does this process affect the power of elites to circulate representations of so- cial suffering and to control their political effects? In developing a framework for the analysis of public discourse, Michael Warner suggests that "the pragmatics of public discourse must be systematically blocked from view" (2002:84).4 Warner reveals how the production of public dis- course revolves around a number of fundamental contradictions. To become pub- lic, a discourse must address a public as a collection of "already existing real per- sons" (2002:82) with some known, specifiable commonalities, and its success depends on the interpellation of the discourse by persons who recognize them- selves not simply as individual receivers but as members of a collectivity that is ad- dressed by the discourse. Because this public is projected as being known in ad- vance, the problem for the discourse producer can be construed as "getting people's attention," imparting knowledge to them, and persuading them to change their attitudes and behavior. Nevertheless, public discourses are, in Warner' s terms, self-creating and self- organizing-the public is actually created through the circulation of discourse as people hear, see, or read it and then engage it in some sort of way. Public health authorities, even when they hire advertising firms or give press briefings, cannot accurately predict who will comprise the public for a given program or how it will be constituted-such as through interest, disinterest, ridicule, or protest. This "autotelic" (Warner 2002:51) process of reification is not accidental but constitutive: the production of public discourse projects an imaginary public that only comes into being as a communicative entity once the discourse circulates. Nevertheless, it must be imagined as real in the course of both production and reception-"people do not commonly recognize themselves as virtual projections" (Warner 2002:82). 291</page><page sequence="6">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY This "imaginary" quality raises a second constitutive contradiction. Like a Hollywood studio that attempts to maximize movie sales, public discourses engage to varying degrees in a process of totalization or universalization, purportedly reaching out to all possible readers, listeners, or viewers. Although they may be di- rected to specific "groups" or "populations," such as "women," "smokers," or "youth," public health discourse differs from a presentation in a school gymnasium by virtue of its address to strangers, to individuals who become part of the public by virtue of their reception of the messages. Nevertheless, Warner notes, "there is no speech or performance addressed to a public that does not try to specify in ad- vance, in countless highly condensed ways, the lifeworld of its circulation" (2002:82). This is not to say, however, that publics are simply brought into being by the insertion of images of imaginary publics. Warner goes on to suggest that this process is shaped by "material limits-the means of production and distribution, the physical textual objects themselves, the social conditions of access to them- and by internal ones, including the need to presuppose forms of intelligibility already in place, as well as the social closure entailed by an genre, idiolect, style, address, and so forth" (2002:54-55). All public discourses are by definition exclusionary, because features of their content, discursive organization, mode of transmission, and so forth, restrict the range of people who are likely to come in contact with and interpellate them. One crucial dimension of the contradiction lies in hiding its relationship to capital. Al- though public discourse pretends to travel wherever it needs to go to reach the pub- lic, it is really a commodity in a market, thereby subject to constraints on produc- tion costs, access to media, and the political economy of reception (particularly access to communicative technologies, media, electricity, dominant languages, and formal education). Here we can build productively on Warner's insights-and avoid the mistaken sense that these discourses are free floating-by examining the institutional settings in which health-related messages are produced and circulated as well as the forms of symbolic capital (Bourdieu 1991) required to participate in this process in particular ways. Finally, Warner (2002:69) suggests that a peculiar feature of moder public discourse is its need to represent the paths through which it intends to circulate. Definitions of social groups and their relationship to the state and other projected groups is reformulated in the complex process through which messages are gener- ated in institutions and picked up by the media as well as the likelihood that par- ticular groups will receive these messages, understand their contents, assimilate them behaviorally, and succeed in preventing the disease. Differences between populations in terms of their relationship to the circulation of health-related infor- mation can be crucial determinants of their citizenship status-at the same time that it shapes understandings of the state and state power. Recent work in linguistic anthropology on language ideologies-beliefs about the nature of communicative processes and the people and technologies on which they rely (see Kroskrity 2000; Schieffelin et al. 1998)-provide interesting perspectives on these questions. Stacy Leigh Pigg (2001) has shown how language ideologies shape what people think they can say in English versus Nepali about AIDS and sex, thereby creating hierarchies of texts and forms of knowledge. Here, I suggest that the language ideologies that commonly guide state-media-public dialogues about health oversimplify the processes through which public discourse 292</page><page sequence="7">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH is produced, circulated, and is received. Linguistic anthropologists have also fo- cused on questions of the circulation or recontextualization of texts and the in- tertextual relationship this process creates. Influenced by M. M. Bakhtin (1981) and Pierre Bourdieu (1991), Charles L. Briggs and Richard Bauman (1992) suggest that, at the same time that intertextual- ity and recontextualization constitute central means of creating social power and control, they remain open to subversion due to a fundamental dialectic in the way they connect discourses and contexts (see also Silverstein and Urban 1996). Par- ticipants can either privilege the intertextual links between successive contexts, the degree to which the content is deemed to remain stable as it circulates, or the in- tertextual gaps, the differences that are seen as having emerged as information is recontextualized. Questions of capital-material and symbolic-shape this proc- ess in multiple ways, including rights to insert discourse into public arenas, to deem some accounts authoritative and subordinate or exclude others, and to use particular representations of health in locating the populations that they interpellate (or fail to interpellate) in political-economic terms. My analysis suggests that he- gemony shapes and limits-but does not mechanically determine-how this proc- ess takes place. It thus provides us with a fascinating window on both the nature and the limits of the power that the state and media exert on publics. The Daily Dance of Journalists and Public Health Officials Cholera became a subject of global public discourse through a series of Inter- national Sanitary Conferences held between 1851 and 1938. In the Americas, the Pan American Sanitary Code of 1924 required national health authorities to notify both the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and neighboring countries of the existence of cases of "regulated" or "controlled" diseases, cholera, yellow fe- ver, plague, and small pox. Starting in 1946, the World Health Organization (WHO) became the global clearinghouse for epidemiological statistics, which are circulated worldwide in WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record. Venezuela officially adopted these reporting requirements in 1939 in its "Rules Governing Obligatorily Reported Diseases." The same legislation that committed the country to turning information regarding "regulated diseases" into global public discourse also set up an official regime for controlling the national production and circulation of information about them: "All data that officials of the [Ministry of] Health obtain regarding obligatorily reported diseases are by their na- ture private, [and] officials who reveal them are subject to" either fines or impris- onment (MSAS 1967:454), a strong warning regarding unauthorized disclosures. The first cases of cholera in South America in the 20th century were reported in Peru in late January 1991. Peruvian health authorities reported 322,562 cholera cases and 2,909 deaths in 1991, and epidemics begin in Colombia and Ecuador in March and Brazil in April. In all, 391,220 cases and 4,002 deaths were reported for 1991 in the Americas (WHO 1993). Venezuelan public health authorities did not announce any cases in the country until November 29, and they only reported 15 cases and 2 deaths in 1991. The official tally for 1992 was 2,842 cases and 68 deaths (WHO 1993); because only laboratory confirmed cases were reported to the World Health Organization, these figures do not represent the full scope of the Venezuelan epidemic (see Briggs with Mantini-Briggs 2003). 293</page><page sequence="8">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY Long before it announced the first cholera cases, efforts by the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MSAS)5 to promote the flow of information about cholera was coupled with deep concern with its regulation. MSAS (1991a) pub- lished an organizational chart that modeled a hierarchical flow of information about cholera cases from hospitals, clinics, and other facilities to district epidemi- ologists and thence to regional and national epidemiologists. The chart makes it clear that only the minister of health and the director of the National Office of Epidemiology have the right to disclose information about cholera to other state of- fices or to parties outside the government, including the press. These officials, re- spectively Pedro Paez Camargo and Lufs Echezuria, were thus designated as the sole official spokespersons on cholera. These laws and guidelines refer to the cir- culation of information during epidemics. Nevertheless, they conferred on high MSAS officials a virtual monopoly over the production of authoritative informa- tion about cholera from February until early December of 1991-that is, before any cases were reported. Starting in early February, articles were published almost daily in the two benchmark newspapers, El Nacional and El Universal, and they appeared fre- quently in national tabloids, the regional press, and television and radio news re- ports. International news services, including Agencia EFE, Associated Press, the New York Times News Service, Reuters, and United Press International, carried stories on the Latin American cholera epidemic that were picked up by Venezuelan papers. Larger dailies soon assigned their own reporters. El Nacional was particu- larly strong in its reporting of public health, medical, and scientific issues. In early 1991, it boasted nearly a dozen reporters who specialized in this area, all of whom had been trained by Aristides Bastidas in a program that combined undergraduate study in journalism at the Universidad Central de Venezuela with a lengthy intern- ship at El Nacional. Interviews with these scientific reporters suggest that they did not define their role in the dissemination of information about health issues in opposition to that of medical and public health professionals-they rather saw themselves as forming part of the scientific/medical community. Isabel Machado,6 who worked for El Na- cional for more than 20 years, pointed to the degree to which these journalists iden- tified themselves with health professionals: "We were almost like unauthorized physicians (medicos piratas), because people thought that we knew; they asked us, when something was bothering them, and we had to say that we didn't know!" (personal communication). El Nacional reporter Roberto Guzman described the beginning of the cholera epidemic in these terms: "It surprised us-we were practi- cally defenseless against an attack from this disease (mal), which is a plague" (per- sonal communication). These reporters frequently used the first person plural, as Guzman uses it here, in constructing a "we" that included both public health pro- fessionals and scientific reporters. Journalists projected the sense that leading public health officials similarly viewed them as members of the same team. Machado noted: They really helped us out a lot, they gave us the bulletins, we called them every day. I had the cell phone number of the minister of health, I'd call, "Look, what's new, has anything happened?" We had access to everybody.... We had the ad- vantage that they knew us already, we weren't just anybody who was calling them. [personal communication] 294</page><page sequence="9">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH Referring to a more recent epidemic, that of dengue fever, she defined the role of scientific reporters: Our function as reporters is to educate, that is, indirectly we are educating the population. Because when you keep insisting about dengue-"don't leave open containers of water," finding an angle to make it newsworthy, and you keep insist- ing, you are really educating.... Our [work] was a grain of sand in the middle of all this. [personal communication] By emphasizing the need to find new information that would make each cholera story interesting and newsworthy, "as much for the reporter as for the public" (Guzman, personal communication), this statement opens up one dimension in which reporters placed themselves alongside "the public" rather than health profes- sionals. (See Chapman and Lupton 1994 on how this concern with newsworthiness shapes health coverage.) Public health officials had a rather different view of reporters. Although they sometimes described the press as playing an important role in transmitting infor- mation to the public, in private they expressed a combination of fear and distrust. Journalists, they claimed, were most interested in finding fault with MSAS efforts, and successes generally were not reported. The press was often characterized as a weak mediating link that included uninformed, gullible, and sometimes unscrupu- lously self-serving individuals who often distorted the words of health profession- als and passed on misinformation. Such accusations sometimes emerged in public. On May 17, 1991, for example, Paez Camargo asserted that a mayor "alarmed by the health problems in his jurisdiction and in order to draw the attention of the authorities, turned some reporters from the region into innocent dupes" who trans- mitted false reports of cholera cases (El Nacional 1991c). Even when they were credited with being helpful and getting the story right, public health officials con- trastively constructed journalists as standing outside the health arena. Reporters played a key role in turning official statements into public dis- course. As Stuart Hall points out, professional concern with separating "fact" from "opinion" or "rumor," obtaining objective and authoritative sources, and generat- ing stories rapidly to meet deadlines all lead journalists to depend heavily on insti- tutions, which generate news on a regular basis (Hall et al. 1978). Guzman, Machado, and their colleagues left their offices each day at about ten in the morn- ing and had to be back by two or three in the afternoon with sufficient material to be able to write two or three articles and submit them to their editor by 6:00 p.m. Public health institutions based their claim to constitute the primary sources of authoritative information not simply on the medicalization of infectious dis- eases but on their special relationship to PAHO and WHO (and thus transnational health authorities, institutions, and discourses) and the national legislation that spelled out their control over the production and circulation of public information about public health. Because the government employed most epidemiologists and controlled the production of health statistics, the central role of epidemiology in creating authoritative cholera stories-and the power of social statistics in spark- ing popular imaginings-rendered this symbiosis between reporters and institu- tions especially pronounced. Moreover, the journalists who covered cholera regularly saw themselves as specialists in scientific matters and they accordingly privileged medicalized views 295</page><page sequence="10">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY of health. Both in their desire for ready sources of information and their own scien- tific ideologies, reporters greatly augmented the ability of high public health offi- cials to construct themselves as the sole legitimate source of authoritative informa- tion about cholera. Paez Camargo and Echezuria thus became what Hall et al. (1978) refer to as the "primary definers" of the cholera story. They shaped the lan- guage that would be used in producing cholera narratives, they proposed the meta- phors that would shape perceptions of the disease, and they decided who would be- come characters in the story and what sorts of roles they would play. Reporters explicitly placed public health officials in this role when contrast- ing their statements with extraoffical accounts of cholera cases. El Mundo publish- ed a United Press International story in which the Panamanian minister of health declared that "if every Panamanian ... starts to give information, we're going to have anarchy here, and in the end you [reporters] won't know, nor will interna- tional organizations know whom to believe" (United Press International 1991). Here, an official not only discredits a single rumor but attempts to banish alterna- tive sources of the production of discourse about cholera from the public domain. When clinicians, community leaders, or others provided information, reporters im- mediately called Paez Camargo (or a regional health official, if the report was from "the interior") in order "to confirm it." Rather than emphasizing the intertextual links between official and alternative contributions, journalists stressed the gaps, making competing sources of information seem maximally far apart-rumors ver- sus scientific proof. Scientific reporters thus played a crucial role in medicalizing public discourse about health. WHO cholera guidelines state that "when cholera is newly suspected in an area, the International Health Regulations require that the diagnosis should be con- firmed by laboratory investigations as soon as possible" (1992:1). To invoke Bruno Latour's (1988) term, such stipulations turn microbiological laboratories into obligatory passage points in the production of biomedical knowledge. Once MSAS refurbished a laboratory in the National Institute of Hygiene (INH) to proc- ess cholera samples, its director declared that "it is up to the INH, with the support of its investigations, to say: 'cholera has begun' " (Diaz Hung 1991a). In her arti- cle, reporter Veronica Diaz Hung turned MSAS's representation of how cholera discourse ought to circulate into "news" and ratified its claim to determine which information was authoritative and which should be expelled from the public sphere. Here we see one of the key characteristics of public discourse in operation: at the same time that reporters treated the circulation of biomedical information as newsworthy, they covered up their own and their editors' roles as the gatekeepers who turned statements uttered by officials over the telephone or to small groups of reporters into public discourse-and excluded other types of information and other classes of speakers. Tying Cholera to Poverty, Street Vendors, and Indigenas As they imagined the course of a cholera epidemic in Venezuela, public health officials and reporters projected three populations as being "at high risk" for cholera. First, los pobres (the poor) were designated as a key population in which cholera cases would be concentrated. Either the poor or "residents of marginal bar- rios" appeared in 55 of the articles in the sample, often as the main focus. Minister 296</page><page sequence="11">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH Figure 1 Hillside barrio in Caracas, contrasted with middle-class apartment buildings. Photo (Frasso) courtesy of El Nacional archives. Paez Camargo suggested that "cholera is an undemocratic disease because it af- fects a very specific part of the population in which hygienic variables are ex- tremely marked" (Bracamonte 1991). Poverty was thus constructed not simply in economic but in behavioral terms. Reporters immediately picked up on this con- nection and expanded it. Marlene Rizk (199 la) suggested that cholera was associ- ated with "a grave deterioration of environment, housing, and culture that has be- come more accentuated with the crisis of recent years." Discussions of poverty and cholera in the press focused particularly on urban cerros (poor hillside communities) or barrios marginales. The juxtaposition of barrios with marginality conveyed a sense of people who stand outside democratic politics, the formal economy, the law, education, and morality. In pinpointing "the poor" as being at high risk for cholera, public health officials and reporters thrust cholera into the middle of the rapid rise of social inequality in the country. The per- centage of the population living in poverty is estimated to have increased from 24 percent in 1981 to 59.2 percent in 1990 (Marquez et al. 1993:146, 155). These arti- cles were often accompanied by photographs of barrio neighborhoods, children playing in the street (naked toddlers providing a common motif), people bathing in open spaces, and areas cluttered with garbage and/or rubble. The photograph re- produced in Figure 1, for example, creates a striking visual contrast between the hillside barrio dwellings and, behind, the middle-class apartment buildings, com- plete with giant satellite dishes. 297</page><page sequence="12">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY '7, '.!

Second, some of the most strident criticism was directed toward street ven- dors who sold hot dogs and hamburgers, homemade candy, drinks, fruit, etc.; they appeared in 33 of the articles. Trying to convince the public not to buy food from these vendors figured centrally in both health education and media efforts. Report- ers used strong negative imagery in suggesting that street vendors were breaking not only sanitary codes by using contaminated water and unhygienic practices in preparing their fare but also moral strictures. Asdrubal Barrios (1991b) describes one Caracas scene: "this reality beats plainly in dark alleyways where [people] play with the health of citizens in the domain of foodstuffs and also in the domain of pleasures, converting one of these comers into a pimping strip where ladies of the night catch the innocent." When their customers continued to purchase these foods and beverages, spokespersons and reporters also focused on the alleged ignorance, abasement, and willfulness of the customers. Photographs often featured long lines of carts, cha- otic throngs of customers, and foodstuffs exposed in open spaces. The chicero (vendor of a homebrewed rice beverage) featured in Figure 2, for example, is shown crouching over a plastic or metal bowl that is placed directly on the side- walk, next to his rustic, hand-decorated cart. The framing of the photograph, with customers bounded in front by a dilapidated section of sidewalk and in back by hurried passersby, along with the indiscrete pose in which the chicero is caught, seems to add irrefutable visual confirmation to the interpretive message presented by reporters and public health officials. 298</page><page sequence="13">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH Figure 3 Indigena woman from Zulia State with child in clinic. Photo (Jesus Castillo) courtesy of El Nacional archives. Third, indigenas also became potential bearers of the disease.7 Appearing in 26 articles in the sample, indigenas figured especially prominently in the media once the first cholera fatality in Venezuela was deemed to be an indigena. The strong moral tone used for the poor and street vendors was juxtaposed with the lan- guage of culture in suggesting why indigenas were particularly at high risk for cholera. "Indigena culture" was constructed as the antithesis of "the national soci- ety." Indigenas were associated with vernacular healing practices-and thus as be- ing ignorant of and rejecting biomedicine-and portrayed as being unhygienic, no- madic, and unconcerned with the health of their families (see Briggs with Mantini- Briggs 2003). When he was pressured to close the border with Colombia, Paez Camargo countered that "Closing the border is an idea that makes no sense, because the Guayu indigenous ethnic group, which is the one that has been affected by the dis- ease, is geographically and culturally a single entity, which feels the same in Co- lombia as in Venezuela and has no concept of physical border" (Zambrano 1991). Any resident who did not recognize the importance of the Venezuela-Colombia border was not a participant in the political life of the nation and could make only weak claims to substantive citizenship. Paez Camargo made the statement during an epoch in which indigenas were pressing for recognition of their political, territo- rial, and human rights in the course of "500 Years of Resistance" actions countering the "Columbian Quincentennary." This construction, made in a press conference by a cabinet-level official, seems to imply that political parties and government 299</page><page sequence="14">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY institutions need not respond to such demands for political representation because indigenas had excluded themselves from the political process. These sorts of gen- eralizations were extended once cholera cases appeared in this region. Paez Camargo declared, for example, that "it is very difficult to work with this popula- tion, because it is itinerant, and its distinct culture makes people fear the measures taken by our physicians" (Linares 1991). In photographs, indigenas were com- monly portrayed in poor rural settings, paddling canoes, and doing arts and crafts. Figure 3 actually appeared just after the first case was reported. It pictures an indigena woman from Zulia State and her child. In all three cases, these powerful visual images naturalized connections be- tween the disease and these populations in several ways. First, the frequent juxta- position of articles on the "threat" of cholera with photographs of the three popula- tions (83 in all) created a visual image that got attached to widespread fear of the disease. Cholera just seemed to be naturally associated with these groups. Second, barrio residents, street vendors, and indfgenas were not pictured cleaning their neighborhoods, stockpiling anti-cholera materials, or giving anti-cholera talks but rather as merging with the scenes of urban decay that surrounded them. Health pro- fessionals, on the other hand, were not only well dressed and pictured in orderly and sanitized environments, but shown actively working to prevent an epidemic. Figure 3 embodies this contrast in a single photograph. While the professional is caught in an active pose, seemingly trying to reach out and help the child, the woman stares off into the distance, not moving and seemingly unmoved, thereby visually conveying the stereotypes of the passive indigena who lacks agency and the will and ability to help herself or her child. Photographs appearing in newspa- pers, along with similar images on television broadcasts, thus helped create a chol- era "geography of blame" (Farmer 1992), reify it as a direct reflection of social re- ality, and imbue it with strong affective significance. These powerful images were used in creating a coherent story that explained the course of a cholera epidemic in Venezuela, all before the first cases were reported in the country.8 The Health Education Program Starting in February 1991, responsibility for organizing a health education and promotion program designed to inform "the public" about cholera and induc- ing it to take steps aimed at preventing an epidemic was located in two MSAS of- fices. First, the Division of Social Health Promotion of the Communicable Dis- eases Program was charged mainly with creating the manuals that would be used in training health professionals and other personnel in cholera prevention and treat- ment and with working directly with community representatives and members of the public. The team consisted of individuals with undergraduate training in the so- cial sciences and education and one journalist; they were all supervised by an epi- demiologist. They took manuals produced by WHO and PAHO on the control of infectious diseases, community participation, and cholera prevention and turned them into booklets produced for health professionals and manuals to be used in training community representatives and employees in other institutions. A Module of Cholera Instruction (MSAS 1991d), published in March 1991, was prepared for use in workshops designed to transform individuals who were not health professionals into disseminators of cholera prevention information. The 300</page><page sequence="15">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH topics discussed include the history of cholera, Vibrio cholerae, the status of hu- mans and their excretions as cholera reservoirs, clinical symptoms, treatment, pre- vention, environmental hygiene, and how to involve community members in pre- vention programs. The popular audience projected for the text is marked not only by the nontechnical language and the stated goal of providing "basic information" but also by drawings that turn Vibrio cholerae into little bacterial monsters, com- plete with hair, eyes, hands, and jagged teeth. Two booklets, a Manual of Norms and Procedures for the Prevention and Management of Diarrheal Diseases and Cholera (MSAS 1991b) and Environmental Sanitation Measures for Preventing Cholera (MSAS 1991c), both released in May, were designed for distribution to physicians and other health professionals. They used a specialized lexicon, and they lacked anthropomorphic drawings of Vibrio cholerae. One of the goals of the Manual of Norms was to "extend through all of the areas of Public Health the unifi- cation of basic, current knowledge and strategies to pursue in the fight against cholera and all diarrheal diseases" (MSAS 1991b: 1). These three publications seemed to become important symbolic capital for the professionals who secured them, indicating their access to MSAS central of- fices; further distribution was thus impeded by the desire on the part of individuals to hold onto their symbolic value. Once cases were reported in Venezuela, the Di- vision of Social Health Promotion, in collaboration with PAHO, initiated projects in Delta Amacuro and Zulia States. The research that they conducted under these auspices consisted primarily of focus groups with public health officials that aimed at eliciting ideas and evaluating strategies. They also worked alongside epidemi- ologists in teaching cholera prevention techniques to residents, particularly in Zulia. Second, the Office of Public Relations was charged with created pamphlets and posters for mass distribution and getting cholera prevention materials into the mass media. Their staff consisted primarily of persons trained as journalists and graphic designers. Newspapers presented prevention information within articles and as separate sections (often intended to be cut out and pasted on walls), such as the following publication of WHO's "golden rules" for cholera prevention: Measures for Avoiding Cholera: ? Wash vegetables with water and vinegar for half an hour. ? Cook fish and seafood well. ? Avoid foods purchased from street vendors [comidas ambulantes]. ? Wash fruit before eating. ? Boil drinking water ten minutes or freeze filtered or bottled water. ? Also wash kitchen utensils with boiled water. ? Wash hands with soap and water before preparing food, serving children, [and] after going to the bathroom, taking care of someone who is ill, or cleaning up after children. * Combat flies; since they come to rest on feces and contaminated water, [they] be- come vehicles of transmission. Use insecticides, and deposit trash in plastic bags and keep them shut. * Use bathrooms and latrines. 301</page><page sequence="16">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY * Prepare powdered milk with boiled water or drink pasteurized milk. [El Na- cional 1991d] Radio and television stations also presented health education information on a regular basis. These succinct recommendations were decontextualized and dehisto- ricized, appearing to apply equally to everyone and to bear no direct relationship to current events. Once the first official case was reported by MSAS on December 3, 1991, both of these offices stepped up the pace. Posters were placed in public spaces, and workers passed out pamphlets on the street and in bus terminals and clinics. The Christmas, New Year's, and Holy Week holidays were the focus of particular concern due to fear that the massive number of people traveling during those times would spread cholera throughout the country. Reporters, public health officials, and politicians deemed the stakes for the health education program to be high. They underlined the centrality of "individual responsibility" (see Gonzalez 1991a). A regional official declared, "it won't help at all if we health authorities make the effort to fight against the disease if the com- munity doesn't support us by paying attention to the recommendations" (Azocar 1991). Diaz Hung (1991b) quotes Milagros Polanco as saying that "if the people fail to follow the basic hygienic norms, everything will be lost." Politicians articu- lated the importance of health education through the language of citizenship and civic participation. Caracas officials attempted to mobilize "the community" by setting up "anti-cholera commandos" consisting of a local official, a physician, and five neighborhood leaders for each parish in order to "make each citizen into an ally" (Gonzalez 1991b). A member of Congress suggested that each citizen must transform himself into a guardian [fiscal] of his own home, place of study or employment, and community, to demand compliance with the rules that have been issued; and when we can make sure that our neighbor protects himself adequately, we are protecting ourselves as well. [Rivero G. 1991: 4] Messages presented as part of the health education program thus embodied what has been observed to be a general feature of the public service announcement type. They tend to "support a politically conservative predisposition to bracket off ques- tions about the structure of society-about the distribution of wealth and power, for example-and to concentrate instead on questions about the behavior of individu- als within that (apparently fixed) structure" (Tesh 1988). To whom was the health education "campaign" directed? This question may seem silly at first glance. The use of the mass media and the placement of posters in public spaces would seem to target all Venezuelans. Constant invocations of la gente (the people), la comunidad venezolana (the Venezuelan community), elpais en general (the country in general), and la mayoria de los venezolanos (the major- ity of Venezuelans) constructed the target audience explicitly and seemed to pro- ject the actual range of dissemination of the health education information material. Nevertheless, let us recall Warer's (2002) suggestion that one of the contradictions that springs from ideological constructions of public discourse involves a discrepancy between claims to be addressing everyone and the embedding of implicit messages that define an implied audience. This contradiction was most apparent in televised messages that showed well-dressed women demonstrating hygienic measures in well-equipped, middle-class kitchens. MSAS cholera prevention pamphlets similarly 302</page><page sequence="17">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH often projected images of middle-class, light-skinned, nuclear families. In one case, a woman dressed in such a fashion as to mark her as Wayuu (indigena from Zulia) was shown demonstrating cholera prevention techniques in a modem, well- equipped kitchen-even though politicians, public health officials, and journalists had characterized "the Wayuu" as being poor and premoder. The pamphlet was designed for distribution among indigenas who lived in Zulia and surrounding states.9 Even basic, widely disseminated, and most highly decontextualized informa- tion, such the Golden Rules and other basic prevention guidelines, seemed to pre- suppose the inclusion of vegetables, fish and seafood, fruit, and powdered milk in diets and sufficient funds to be able to purchase soap, pesticides, plastic bags, vine- gar to wash vegetables, and gas to boil water for consumption and for washing utensils. Many homes not only lacked freezers but bathrooms, latrines, and running water. The nearly 40 percent of the labor force engaged in the informal economy spent substantial parts of their day on the street; telling them to avoid foods pur- chased from street vendors might seem like asking these individuals to go hungry (not to mention threatening to deprive the members of a substantial sector of the in- formal economy of their primary source of income). The media campaign thus seemed oblivious to the economic constraints that rendered the implementation of such procedures difficult or impossible for the majority of Venezuelans. The health education program was thus structured by a fatal contradiction. The epidemiological message suggested that if you are poor, a street vendor or one of their customers, or an indigena you are "at high-risk" to get cholera. If you are middle- or upper class and not racially marked, you are very unlikely to get the dis- ease. The primary audience for health education, as defined by the middle-class images in many of the messages and seeming economic prerequisites for enacting the prevention guidelines, was unlikely to interpellate this information, because its members do not consider themselves to be dirty or ignorant and they had been told that they were not likely to get cholera. Several obstacles thwarted people who fit the high-risk profile from interpel- lating the message. First, they could not recognize themselves in the health educa- tion discourse-they were not projected as part of its public. Second, to interpellate oneself as in need of cholera health education was to accept an image of oneself as premodem, dirty, ignorant, superstitious, impoverished, and a threat to the health of the body politic. Accepting a denigrating image of oneself is a high price to pay for getting information! Third, the explicit message that no intertextual gaps were acceptable between state discourses and public responses was contradicted by this tremendous gap between "news" and "pedagogy," a hiatus that assumed quite dif- ferent forms and proportions for the middle class, on the one hand, and people pro- jected as being poor, street vendors, or indigenas, on the other. The surveillance conducted in poor and indfgena communities and of street vendors was used in measuring the success or failure of health education efforts. Just as epidemiologists visited poor neighborhoods, street vendors, and indigena communities to assess conditions, Guzman describes how reporters became ama- teur epidemiologists: We arrived at poor homes (ranchos), at unhealthy dwellings, and we asked the women how they were storing water, under what conditions, the characteristics of 303</page><page sequence="18">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY the dwellings.... A poor home can be a perfect culture [in the biological sense] for cholera wreaking havoc. So we went and asked the women, the housewives, we looked at the children, we took photos of the little naked children, with their bellies swollen by symptoms of malnutrition. [personal communication] Veteran cholera reporter Marlene Rizk drew on such observations in assess- ing the results of health education efforts: "None of these measures is being com- plied with, and it only takes a trip through the center of the city [Caracas] where every day the number of street vendors increases or a visit to any barrio, where the minimum hygienic conditions are missing" (1991 c). Reporters and officials do not seem to have visited middle-class or wealthy homes or to have inspected restau- rants in well-to-do neighborhoods before deciding that the program had failed. This structural process of misrecognition (see Taylor 1994) effectively pre- vented all parties from interpellating these messages, from believing that they were directed at them and that they meshed with their own perceived social locations and identities. The health education program thus constituted a classic Batesonian double-bind in which the overt message is contradicted and overridden by an im- plicit metamessage (Bateson et al. 1972). Resisting Unsanitary Subjecthood Medical anthropologists have argued that we should not assume that state power or processes of medicalization turns patients and publics into dupes who passively accept dominant constructions. Studies of women's responses to repro- ductive technologies, for instance, suggest that people respond in complex, prag- matic, sometimes contradictory, and often unpredictable ways to hegemonic ide- ologies and practices (see Ginsburg and Rapp 1995; Lock and Kaufert 1998). Accordingly, if my analysis were to end here, thereby giving the impression that publics simply accepted the content of cholera discourse and the hegemonic model of its circulation, I would leave out crucial elements of the story. Just as the state was using cholera to shape an image of the poor, popular sec- tors used the disease to shape public opinion of the state. Stepped-up repression af- ter the February 27, 1989 popular insurrection augmented the uncertainty of life in poor neighborhoods. The coup attempt organized by Lt. Colonel Hugo Frias Chavez on February 4, 1992 may have failed, but it created a more visible space for debating the role of the government and evaluating its policies. Popular mistrust contributed to the tendency to regard cholera as a smokescreen (cortina de humo) conjured up to keep people from thinking about the crisis and criticizing the gov- ernment.10 The location of some specific sites of resistance are interesting. When Cara- cas officials urged community representatives to join them in establishing an "anti- c6lera commando," some read these attempts to enhance community participation as an attempt to place the government's health obligations on the public: The neighbors complain that the anti-cholera campaign has been focused in such a way that it appears as if the only one responsible for all of this is the common citi- zen. "Doesn't the government also have responsibilities to assume, such as sup- plying hospitals, cleaning the streams, and providing the population with drinking water?" [Gonzalez 1991b] 304</page><page sequence="19">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH Second, some communities seem to have felt that surveillance and control were di- rected not at cholera but at them, and they sometimes actively resisted. Public offi- cials complained, for example, that Wayuu communities "arm themselves and confront health commissions" (Montes de Oca 1992). One of the most pervasive and visible sites of resistance lay with our old friends, the street vendors. Unable to get their responses into the public sphere, they largely voted with their feet-they continued to sell their products even in the face of criticism and prohibition. The sale and consumption of food and drink on the street grew markedly in the 1980s and 1990s. In the face of massive underem- ployment, unemployment, and steep price increases, many workers had been driven out of the formal economy and into the ranks of vendors, whereas others used sales to supplement wages. Datanalisis, an economic consulting firm, esti- mated that 39 percent of the population worked in the informal sector in 1992. Many of their customers faced longer work schedules, longer commutes, and/or the need to work more than one job. For them, cheap food purchased on the street helped meet both temporal and economic constraints. Criticism by reporters and public health officials of vendors and their customers cut "formal" capitalism, glo- balization, and government policies out of the picture. In making a fetish of the vendors' transactions, the health education program transformed a pervasive social and political-economic effect of globalization into the cause of increases in infectious diseases. But these conditions were part of a process that has engulfed many Latin American cities in a structural chaos so deep that the state could no longer effectively claim the ability to maintain order (see Garcia Canclini 1989). This inversion of cause and effect, the transformation of global structural processes into faulty individual decisions, and the adoption of medical profiling procedures were accomplished by cholera discourses even be- fore Vibrio cholerae appeared in Venezuela. MSAS seemed to be completely out of touch. This sense of misrecognition discredited MSAS in the eyes of many. An El Nacional poll conducted in April 1991 found that only 1 percent of respondents thought that hospitals were "well prepared" for an epidemic, 27 percent believed that hospitals were "somewhat prepared," and 72 percent thought that they were "not prepared at all" (El Nacional 199 lb). A July El Nacional poll reported that 50 percent of respondents believed that cholera "had indeed come to Venezuela," but that MSAS was "hiding the cases." Only 36 percent stated that MSAS was telling the truth, while 14 percent said they didn't know (Rizk 1991b). A newspaper poll conducted in February 1991 suggested that 65 percent "said that they do NOT be- lieve that the authorities will do everything necessary for prevention of the dis- ease." The data revealed a striking gender gap: women outnumbered men more than two to one among the ranks of skeptical respondents, while nearly eight times as many men believed that MSAS efforts were sufficient (El Nacional 199 la). Reporters sometimes framed criticisms of MSAS and its top officials in their own voices. El Nuevo Pals captioned a photograph of a broadly smiling MSAS minister as follows: [Rafael Orihuela] leaves the [Presidential] Palace wearing his best smile, in spite of the resurgence of infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, and cholera, generated by the complete lack of attention on the part of the government of President 305</page><page sequence="20">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY Perez to health issues (the IMF [International Monetary Fund] is only interested in payment of the debt and handing over state industries). [Gonzalez 1992] The richly parodic article accompanying the photograph countered Ori- huela's contention that "Venezuela can relax" because the government had con- trolled the outbreak of cholera by asserting that "new outbreaks of malaria and den- gue, newly reborn Third World diseases, along with cholera" presented clear and present dangers. Photographers sometimes contributed to these critiques. A photo- graph by Eresto Morgado juxtaposed piles of trash and filthy waste water in asso- ciation with a huge sign that marks the scene as a project of the Caracas city gov- ernment.11 Here, images that the state imbued with moral and political meanings seemed to get turned back on the state. Subversive readings also emerged in televi- sion comedy programs that parodied official statements. It would, however, be unwise to exaggerate the extent of this reportorial resis- tance. Journalists did not challenge MSAS officials' status as the primary definers of cholera discourse, nor did they elevate critiques of public discourse about health and the social spaces in which they were generated to the level of equally valid sites for the production of cholera information, shift the basic terms of their stories, or challenge dominant equations between cholera and social inequality. Critical public voices were subordinated in terms of the relative frequency with which they spoke (much less than MSAS officials), their placement in articles (generally to- ward the end), and the types of discursive acts they were permitted to perform (such as criticizing MSAS proposals rather than offering their own), a common way that inequality structures media discourse (see van Dijk 1991). In short, the media left the hegemonic model for circulation of medical and public health infor- mation and its authority intact. Nor did these criticisms result in a shift in the way that agency was con- structed in cholera news: when reporting the "news" about cholera, reporters cast both Vibrio cholerae and MSAS officials as agents, as the forces that either caused or could cause things to happen, while the public-and particularly the poor and indigenas-were constructed as patients (here in the grammatical sense of the term), thereby replicating another general feature of discourses of social inequality (see van Dijk 1989).12 Herein lies another basic contradiction of the health educa- tion program. Having already established that the poor, indigenas, and street ven- dors lacked agency and, therefore, could not change in ways that would enable them to get out of cholera's way, the health education program required them to do just that. While the press may have occasionally relayed voices that pointed out this contradiction, it did not fundamentally revise its picture of passive unsani- tary subjects. In short, these criticisms did not dislodge reporters from their role in elevating high MSAS officials to the status of the primary definers of cholera discourse. Rather, circulating criticisms helped construct the journalists' role as that of objective, neutral collectors of facts. They could seem to align themselves with the people, thereby claiming the right to ventriloquize the reaction of the public to MSAS dis- course, and confirm their role as the public's watchdog, as doing the work of criti- cally assessing the truth and value of official statements. Oddly, one important fo- cus of popular criticism of the circulation of public discourse on cholera seems to have been overlooked by journalists-how people resisted media representations 306</page><page sequence="21">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH and the power of the media to legitimize MSAS's authority. Reporting popular criticisms of MSAS can thus be seen as a strategy of dissimulation, as playing their part in keeping the pragmatics of public discourse-particularly the press's own practices-"systematically blocked from view" (Warner 2002:84). How Public Discourses Circulate: Idealized Links and Pragmatic Gaps The public health officials and scientific reporters we interviewed largely shared an ideological construction of how public discourse about cholera should be produced and circulated. Authoritative information about the disease emanated from privileged sectors of MSAS, particularly the National Office of Epidemiol- ogy and the INH national reference laboratory, and the international institutions that shape health policies and practices, PAHO and WHO. This information then moved through three circuits. First, health profession- als, particularly those employed by MSAS, received technical information from manuals, the Boletln Epidemiologico Semanal (Weekly Epidemiological Record), circulars, and the like. Second, the Division of Social Health Promotion then passed along nontechnical information, such as the Module of Cholera Instruction, posters, and brochures, to employees in other institutions, community leaders, and other persons who are not health professionals. Some of this information also found its way to "the public" via the media. Finally, statements by the minister of health and the director of the National Office of Epidemiology, as articulated in press conferences and telephone calls, were relayed as news by reporters to their audiences. Both journalists and public health officials point to how this informa- tion should be received-it should be comprehended, assimilated into ways of thinking about hygiene, food procurement and preparation, the environment, and so forth, relayed to family members, coworkers, and neighbors, and embodied in action. When it operates correctly, this process should be characterized by intertex- tual links alone-no gaps should appear. Such transformations as lexical register shifts from scientific terms to a nontechnical vocabulary, transitions between or beyond institutions, changes of communicative channel, context, and participants should not create gaps, because continuity was defined in terms of the stability of semantic content. Gaps in these circuits were problematic, reflecting either igno- rance (an inability to recontextualize this information) or willful resistance to an educational process on which the health of the nation and its citizens depends. Be- cause both media coverage and public health information was aimed at the public and therefore accessible to everyone, the failure of individuals to gain this informa- tion and use it in preventing cholera-breaks in the transmission circuit-were their own fault. This language ideology systematically blocks from view the way that the ide- alized process of discourse production and circulation itself created a vast network of gaps and communicative barriers, along with the material and symbolic in- equalities to which it was tied. Thus, the image of a horizontal, unidirectional flow of information masked the creation of quite vertical structures of knowledge and status in a number of ways: First, the temporality of circulation of public discourse is crucial, in that peo- ple gain access to messages at different times and accordingly use them in claiming 307</page><page sequence="22">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY different social positions. (The concern with "being in the loop" points to the desire for enhancing one's own relationship to the temporality of circulation.) Epidemi- ologists and INH microbiologists enjoyed temporal priority over other MSAS health professionals, who, in turn, superseded reporters; the information finally reached their audiences and persons with whom viewers and readers conversed. Health promotion specialists similarly trained community leaders who then, in turn, educated their neighbors. This image of circulation turns time into social hier- archies. Second, as Pigg (2001) points out for HIV/AIDS education in Nepal, the ranking of texts in terms of their provenience (in Geneva or Washington versus Ca- racas), lexical register, and degree of detail project a hierarchical view of audi- ences, creating gradations of knowledge and capacities for assimilating health-re- lated information. Third, a person's own social standing was marked by the person from whom he or she received information (the minister of health versus a reporter versus a health promotion worker versus a community representative). The farther you were located down the discursive chain, the less authority and agency you were projected as enjoying. Some people can produce cholera discourse and sort authoritative from illegitimate information; others (e.g., clinicians) can transmit it with authority. Still others (such as community leaders) can only transmit a popu- lar understanding of it.13 Others can only embody the information in their behavior and transmit it within their immediate social environments. Fourth, recipients were projected as ratified hearers on the basis of construc- tions of implied audiences, reducing others to the status of ideologically excluded overhearers. At the same time that Camacho insisted, with reference to her scien- tific reporter peers, that "we always share the idea that we are writing for every- one," she clearly specified that the readers of El Nacional were primarily "students, teachers, professors, professionals" (personal communication). Nonprofessionals and persons with limited educational opportunities did not figure among her im- plied readers. As I have suggested above, pronouns and other discourse features projected the three "at high risk" groups as being third parties who were referred to but not addressed by El Nacional stories. Locations within this projected process of discourse circulation were also graphically projected in the accompanying photographs. Health professionals were pictured precisely in their roles in actively circulating discourse about cholera and/or effecting material preparations-processing laboratory samples, stockpil- ing resources, examining sanitary infrastructures and domestic spaces, and the like. They seemed to form part of the very event of circulation as they look at the camera or fit into the bodily frame of the meeting, tour, or other performance of cholera prevention. Barrio residents, indigenas, and street vendors seem to have been al- ways caught in the act. Rather than staring into the camera or focusing on preven- tion activities, they seemed to embody its antithesis-bathing in the open, playing next to piles of garbage, serving food in spaces surrounded by crowds, cars, and urban decay, or just living in the wrong part of the city. They were entirely out of the loop, not only failing to play any active role in circulating cholera prevention discourse but seeming to be entirely unaware of or resistant to it. The projected readers of El Nacional (with the exception of health professionals) were strikingly absent, seldom appearing in these photographs. Because they were reading 308</page><page sequence="23">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH authoritative information about cholera as conveyed by authorized scientific re- porters, their role in acquiring information regarding cholera prevention would seem to have gone without saying (or rather photographing). This fragmentation process does not emerge simply from these projections of where different players are expected to fit into the process. Officials and reporters also commented explicitly on the degree to which participants were performing their parts adequately. Recall Paez Camargo's criticism of reporters who had been turned into "innocent dupes" by a politician concocting cholera cases; he implicitly suggests that they behave properly when taking only official statements as news sources. Reporters sometimes returned the favor by criticizing MSAS officials for failing to provide useful, accurate, and timely information about cholera, as in El Nuevo Pais's parodic characterization of Minister Orihuela's smile. Reporters more commonly ratified the position of public health officials as not only being in the loop but ensuring its proper operation; Diaz Hung (199 la) thus suggested that "The false alarm that cholera has arrived has circulated several times. A few hours later, you hear the minister of [M]SAS, Pedro Paez Camargo, disproving the ru- mor." Assessments also focused on differences associated with the degree to which these imagined hierarchical nodes were reflecting cholera prevention discourse be- haviorally. Both MSAS officials and reporters visited barrios and indigena com- munities and inspected their homes and neighborhoods just as they observed the street vendors' carts. Rizk's (1991c) indictment: "None of these measures" has been transposed into action by street vendors or barrio residents. Here again, mid- dle-class readers remain invisible-neither epidemiologists nor reporters visited their homes, workplaces, or neighborhoods to see if their behavior reflected the prevention guidelines. Interestingly, Camacho told me that it was easy to interview members of the working class and gain access to their homes, but middle-class residents would seldom even consent to be interviewed about cholera or other epi- demic diseases. She did not mention attempting any inspections there. The state and the media made little effort to deprivatize the lives of the middle class through health surveillance, and it does not appear that it would have been easy to do so. Now we come back to Warner. Public discourse about cholera did not simply reach the public but defined four different publics: barrio residents, street vendors, indigenas, and sanitary citizens of the middle class. These "groups" were not de- fined by cholera or its epidemiological trace-no cases had yet been reported in Venezuela. They were defined not only through the referential content of these dis- courses, the descriptions of their beliefs, habits, environmental conditions, etc., but also by the place that they were assigned in this idealized circulation of public dis- course. These four publics were defined in contrast to both health professionals and reporters. (The journalists placed themselves within the public health "we," whereas officials positioned them much closer to "the public.") These gaps undermined the idealized image of discourse circulation as well as its pragmatic enactment. Located at the very end of a discursive chain that also formed a social hierarchy-and portrayed as lacking the cognitive, attitudinal, and material prerequisites for successfully bringing the circuit to completion-it would seem that people cast in the cholera story as barrio residents, indigenas, and street vendors were expected to fail. Calls for fostering community participation were thus issued in bad faith. And if preventing a cholera epidemic was deemed to be 309</page><page sequence="24">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY contingent on getting these three sectors to embody public discourse about cholera, then the "campaign" as a whole appears to have been designed in such a way that its outcome would be, at best, uncertain. Unnamed, unstigmatized, and interpellated as the designated audience for denigrating depictions of the other three publics, sanitary citizens seldom seemed to challenge the way they were positioned in this projected process. Many of the people who got thrust into the barrio resident, street vendor, and indigena slots, on the other hand, sought to redefine the way that they were interpellated by cholera public discourse. Many individuals defined their position by rejecting aspects of its content, from its more blatantly stigmatizing social features to even the idea that cholera-qua disease-existed at all. Many people challenged the regime of truth that cast MSAS as the locus of production of knowledge and their own relegation to a passive and dependent role. But it is clear that many individuals reconfigured the referential field in which cholera signifiers were located, using images of the disease as means of evoking corruption, the indifference of state officials to their needs, the failure of state insti- tutions to provide adequate services, and the lack of adequate jobs and housing. They thereby subversively cast themselves as producers of cholera discourse, as people who could see what was really going on. At the same time, this transgres- sive mode of interpellation shifted not just ideas about how cholera discourse cir- culated but its very political definition. Discourse became less a referential and cognitive process of the coding and decoding of free-floating signifiers (presum- ably tied to "real" referents) than a set of practices that were grounded in material reality, such as access to food, running water, sewage facilities, adequate housing, and health care. Rather than challenge the constitution of multiple publics or their inclusion in a particular sector, most individuals who talked back to public health officials seemed to challenge the dominant model as to how public discourse ought to circulate and how a seemingly linear, horizontal process created discontinuous, hierarchically arranged categories of knowledge and knowers. Kitzinger (1998) suggests that even when audiences are skeptical of media coverage (and thus of re- porters's sources), the media may still constitute the primary source of information about an issue. Nevertheless, this case suggests that the force of subversive read- ings also springs from people's ability to question hegemonic projections of the routes of circulation of public discourses and/or how they are positioned within them. Evidence from other South American countries regarding resistance to official discourses about cholera suggests that the Venezuelan experience is hardly unique. Marilyn Nations and Christina Monte (1996) document the highly stigmatizing nature of the anti-cholera discourse produced by the Brazilian state and how it led to widespread rejection of health education recommendations. Rudi Colloredo- Mansfeld (1998) suggests that even as indigenous residents of Otavalo in Ecuador were gaining economically on their neighbors through transnational sales of hand- crafts and culture, an outbreak of cholera led to their depiction as "dirty Indians" who would naturally be "at risk" for the disease. Marcos Cueto (1997) suggests that poor Peruvians challenged stigmatizing images by placing cholera in a much wider geopolitical frame. And this sort of relationship between states, classes, and cholera is hardly confined to Latin America or the late twentieth century. Morris (1976:95) suggests with respect to the 1832 cholera epidemic in England that the 310</page><page sequence="25">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH middle and upper classes reacted strenuously to what they saw as a threat to their privileges. Contrastively, "from a working-class viewpoint this reaction was a threat to their normal life and legitimate rights far more serious than anything promised by cholera itself" (see also Delaporte 1986; Evans 1987). Conclusion Thus, problems with public discourses on health cannot simply be blamed on ignorant or manipulative journalists or on paranoid and disrespectful public health officials. In the example I have described, these parties were largely in agreement regarding an ideological view of how health-related information is produced and how it circulates. Health professionals often get angry over reporters' penchants for extracting words from institutional contexts and placing them in new textual settings, leading to such charges as "I've been misquoted" or "You took my words out of context." The point is that fragmenting discourse is par for the course-the way it circu- lates through complex arrays of institutional and noninstitutional settings, regis- ters, genres, channels, and participants; moreover, health professionals are just as guilty in this regard. Their recontextualizations are legitimized by the ideology of referential stability. In Latour's (1988) terms, they claim to have created immuta- ble mobiles, packets of information that can travel around without changing their meaning as they move from Washington to Caracas and are recontextualized in a variety of manuals, posters, pamphlets, press briefings, and public service an- nouncements. As Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star (1999) argue, even such seem- ingly water-tight entities as diagnostic categories carry the history of the institu- tional sites they have visited within them, no matter how much they may seem to be impervious to recontextualization. The way that these juxtapositions of micro- biological, clinical, and social information that emerge in cholera manuals, pam- phlets, and press briefings are interpreted and the social effects that they create are highly sensitive to changes of context, channel, genre, and personnel. Claims by health professionals that it is only reporters who fragment information about health-even as they turn projections of horizontal and linear transmission into a wealth of hierarchically ordered social categories-seem, shall we say, naive. Let us return here to the issues with which I began this article: health inequali- ties, the need for greater public involvement in public health, and the distinction between sanitary citizens and unsanitary subjects. Starting in the nineteenth cen- tury, states that claimed the mantle of modernity also claimed the right to use health as one of the key bases for creating normative definitions of citizenship. Since that time, state discourses about health have differentially interpellated peo- ple on the basis of their perceived relationship to hygiene, medical knowledge, and ways of preventing and treating diseases. Public health has thus involved, since its moder inception, ways of addressing "the public" that create a range of publics. Health discourse has thus played a crucial role in defining and naturalizing social inequality. Recent work in medical anthropology, the history of medicine and pub- lic health, medical sociology, science studies, and other fields has helped us grasp the many ways that differential access to biomedical technologies and clinical practices and the circulation of stigmatizing images expands social inequality, 311</page><page sequence="26">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY often with fatal effects. At least in the present case, models of the manner in which health-related information is produced and circulates and attempts to control this process provide a means of creating and naturalizing social inequalities. Latour (1993) argues that purifying and hybridizing practices implicitly con- nect science and society at the same time that they explicitly pretend to separate them. This distinction can help us grasp the problem at hand. The more officials and reporters suggest that one's location in the circulation of health discourse is contingent on individual differences in knowledge and acceptance of biomedical knowledge, the more these circuits get intertwined with material inequalities and stigmatizing images. Drawing on visual cultural studies (see Burgin 1996; Sturken and Cartwright 2001), I argue that photographs place particular locations in projec- tions of discursive circulation, stigmatizing images, and material inequalities to- gether in the same frame. How you get placed vis-a-vis imagined publics and implied readers-and therefore how your speech and behavior are read in relationship to diseases-turns out to both shape and be shaped by your access to sanitary infra- structures and health care. My analysis suggests that the dominant ideology regarding the circulation of public discourses, at least when applied to public health, further undermines the health of the most medically underserved populations. But does it really serve the state-or at least public health professionals who are working to address these problems? Recall the rising emphasis on health promotion, the Institute of Medi- cine's (1988) call for more public involvement in health, and the growing influ- ence of policies that accord substantial weight to community participation in health programs (see Minkler and Wallerstein 2003). If, as Martin Barbero (1987) sug- gests, our perceptions of self, society, and the state are fundamentally mediated, then public discourses about health shape basic conditions of possibility for fash- ioning new state-public relations with regard to health. Insofar as the ideologies, pragmatics, and material relations that shape the cir- culation of health-related information create chasms between health institutions and publics-and between people perceived as sanitary citizens and unsanitary subjects-getting communities to collaborate with public health institutions and clinicians will be an uphill battle. Efforts by progressive practitioners to creatively seek ways of fostering horizontal collaborations that promote community involve- ment are hindered when the airwaves and newspapers project discursive hierar- chies that distance public health professionals and clinicians from publics, particu- larly when they place the very participants in projects targeted at disease-burdened communities at the end of circuits of information and power. When the state extols the virtues of citizen involvement in health and then creates discursive chasms that effectively makes it impossible to shape public discourses about health and even to be credited with understanding them, distrust of public health institutions would seem to be a foregone result. In an era in which social inequality is expanding unrelentingly and health inequities are far from disappearing, this contradiction is fatal for both underserved communities and public health institutions alike. It would be presumptuous to purport to provide a formula for confronting these problems on the basis of a single study. Not all diseases are reported in the same way, not all health professionals and reporters share the same language ide- ologies, and these connections do not have the same political and medical effects in all parts of the planet. Indeed, we need a great deal of comparative research to establish 312</page><page sequence="27">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH the broader parameters of these processes. But I do think it possible to offer some tentative suggestions. First, as Warer's (2002) article suggests, Venezuelan public health officials are not the only ones whose attempts to place information into public circulation are guided by a rather naive idea as to how this process works. Models of horizon- tal, linear, and unidirectional flows of information legitimize implicit hierarchical structures far beyond the country's borders (see Patton 1996). Second, hierarchies of biomedical knowledge do not lend themselves to iden- tifying who is most capable of deciphering the complex pragmatics of public dis- courses about health. More accurately anticipating the social effects of health-re- lated public discourses requires the involvement of people who understand how discourse circulates in all phases of the design and implementation process, not simply in deciding how booklets or press releases are worded. Third, this is an area in which community-based participatory research is sorely needed. It may seem bizarre to suggest that members of the most under- served communities should help shape how high officials present public informa- tion about health. Nevertheless, such involvement is not only crucial for rooting out stigmatizing images but also for uprooting the hierarchical relations created by placing the people who face the worst health conditions as the final link on a pro- jected information chain. Why not include people who are "experts" in reading how information is interpellated within their own communities? In doing so, we might learn a lot more about the full range of publics that emerge as discourse about health circulates. Nevertheless, inviting popular participation in shaping how health-related public discourse is disseminated should form part of efforts to break the hold of hegemonic models and practices-not to make them more effec- tive. The state tries to speak to the people about other topics, such as democratic practices, drugs, ecology, education, and crime. In the United States and other countries in which neoconservative movements have gained ascendancy, the per- ceived failure of liberal programs aimed at inspiring publics to act in ways that the state deems to be rational have provided neoconservative critics with arguments to eliminate services for the growing ranks of the poor-or to make them more inac- cessible and punitive. Creating discursive blueprints that lead to such failures, or, more precisely, to the perception that they have failed, contributes not simply to preserving the "kinder, gentler" hegemony of the welfare state but to regimes that eliminate restrictions on economic exploitation and enact "race-blind" policies that suppress public challenges to discrimination. If health has been crucial for shaping notions of citizenship, publics, and the state for nearly two centuries, health spe- cialists can play a key role in challenging these attempts to rationalize new in- equalities. This case sheds new light on a problem that has generated a great deal of re- search and theorizing in anthropology in recent years, how states generate hegemonic discourses, their political economic effects, and possibilities for resist- ing them. Along with medical historians, sociologists, and specialists in women's and cultural studies, medical anthropologists have challenged the modernist sepa- ration of science and society (see Latour 1993) in demonstrating how states, trans- national corporations, and international agencies shape constructions of diseased and healthy bodies (e.g., see Briggs with Mantini-Briggs 2003; Cohen 1998; 313</page><page sequence="28">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY Lindenbaum 1998; Martin 1987, 1994; Pigg 2001; Rapp 1999). Scholars have also demonstrated how medical ideologies and practices both reflect and shape political economies and structure relations of inequality (see Das 1995; Farmer 1992, 1999, 2003; Kim et al. 2000; Nichter 1987; Scheper-Hughes 1992). The present case points to a dimension of these processes that is not ade- quately revealed either by sensitive analyses of how images located in health-re- lated discourses legitimize power relations and forms of inequality or by illumina- tions of the broader political-economic and historical factors that shape diseases and their social effects. When medicalized constructions become public discourse, grasping their social, cultural, political, and medical consequences also entails analysis of the political economy of the complex pragmatics entailed in their pro- duction, circulation, and reception. Following Warer, I have argued that neither the images themselves nor the broader contexts in which they circulate provide ac- curate indicators of how they will be read or how they will affect peoples' lives. Such analysis is a key prerequisite to understanding how states create power through discourse as well as how people resist them. I would thus urge a new focus of concern for medical anthropologists who seek to understand discourses of health and disease and their political-economic underpinnings and effects. Developing this desideratum will be most fruitful if medical and linguistic anthropologists engage more widely in dialogue-and if training in medical anthropology includes grounding in discourse processes. There is a double motivation for developing a political economy of the complex pragmat- ics of health-related discourses. This sort of analysis can help us understand how the state and media create dominant conceptions of health, disease, and the body and some of the ways they are resisted. But it can also assist us in identifying ways in which we are influenced by hegemonic formulations. Insofar as anthropologists, medical or otherwise, themselves rely on simplistic, linear models of discourse, we run the risk of helping the state and other dominant institutions conceal the effects of dominant discourses-and strategies for challenging them-from view. NOTES Acknowledgments. This article has benefited from excellent criticism provided by three reviewers for Medical Anthropology Quarterly, fellow members of the Health and Race Group at the University of California, San Diego (Hector Carrillo, Steven Epstein, Natalia Molina, Lisa Sun-Hee Park, David Naguib Pellow, and Nayan Shah), Vincanne Adams, and audiences at the Instituto de Altos Estudios en Salud Piblica "Amoldo Gabald6n" (Maracay, Venezuela), the Department of Anthropology of the Universidad Aut6noma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa (Mexico City), the Escuela Nacional de Salud Piblica (Habana, Cuba), and the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de la Cuenca (Cuenca, Ecuador). Employees of the (then) Ministry of Health and Social Assistance, journalists, politicians, and many others gave generously of their time in documenting the cholera pre- vention program. Maria Alejandra Romero helped compile the newspaper sample, Jansi L6pez assisted in quantifying their thematic foci, and Estrella Mantini and Licet Villanueva transcribed the interviews. Financial support for the overall project was provided by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the So- cial Science Research Council, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Wenner- Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Inc., and the Academic Senate of the University of California, San Diego. Clara Mantini-Briggs, MD, served as my collaborator in the overall research project and enriched this article with her ideas and criticisms. 314</page><page sequence="29">POWER AND PRAGMATIC MISCALCULATION IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES ON HEALTH Correspondence may be addressed to the author at the Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0528. 1. In The Future of Public Health, the Institute of Medicine suggests, for example, that "Public health is what we, as a society, do collectively to assure the conditions in which peo- ple can be healthy" (1988:1). 2. With regard to media coverage of health issues, also see Arkin 1990, Chapman and Lupton 1994, Convissor et al. 1990, Dorfman and Wallack 1993, Joffe and Haarhoff 2002, Leask and Chapman 2002, Miller et al. 1998, U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv- ices 1991, and Wallack 1989. 3. To be sure, collaborations between public health professionals and advertising spe- cialists are of tremendous importance (see, e.g., Lyles 2002). I do not treat them here be- cause they did not enter into the anti-cholera program that I analyze. 4. Warer's essay is, of course, part of a much larger discussion of public spheres, public cultures, and "counterpublics" (see Fraser 1992). For examples, see Calhoun (1992) and Gaonkar and Lee (2002). 5. The institution has now been renamed the Ministry of Health and Social Development. 6. Like all other names of persons interviewed in connection with this study, this name is fictional. 7. I place the term indigena in italics throughout this article in order to indicate that it does not refer to a bounded, discrete social group. Dividing Venezuelans into discrete and nonoverlapping "indigenous" and "nonindigenous" categories is less a reflection of a perva- sive and elementary social difference than a tool for imposing racial categories and the forms of social inequality that go with them. 8. Comer et al. (1990) argue that readers process visual images differently from text. Images hold a "positioning power" that generates affective responses that are more resistant to reflection and deconstruction. 9. This information is drawn from a 2003 interview that Clara Mantini-Briggs con- ducted with a member of the former Division of Social Health Promotion team. 10. Both this phrase and the notion of un invento (a lie) emerged repeatedly in public health officials' accounts of their attempts to measure public views of a possible an epi- demic. Our interviews suggest that some members of the working class continued to believe that the cholera epidemic was a fiction concocted by the government to draw attention away from its own problems long after cases were reported in Venezuela. 11. This photograph appeared in El Nacional on September 29, 1992. Although it thus falls outside of the stories that appeared prior to the time that the first cases were reported in Venezuela, other photographs that similarly criticize the government appeared during the period of the sample (February to early December 1991). 12. Rosenberg (1989:5) argues that the attribution of agency to diseases is common: "Once articulated and accepted, disease entities became 'actors' in a complex social situ- ation." Also see Tomes 2000. 13. The contested positioning of reporters here is interesting. Although they claimed the ability to transmit health information more technically and authoritatively than "the public," health officials lumped them together with other nonprofessionals. But reporters claimed a mode of discursive agency that no other actors possessed-the ability to draw on multiple sources and discover how to make information newsworthy.
