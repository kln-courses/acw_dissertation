<plain_text><page sequence="1">Talks on Faith. By Thomas Hughes, S.J. (Longmans, Green. 10/6.) As the title indicates these Talks pretend to be neither strictly scientific nor exhaustive. Indeed one could have wished, that m Prayer the author had included the famous words of Trent, 'God commands not impossible things. By His command He ad- monishes you to do what you can, and to pray when anything is impossible, and He helps so that it is possible to you ' (Sess. 6, cap. ii). This is very practical since many non-Catholics follow Mill and believe the Will is not free but must obey the present greatest motive. A discussion here would point out the error of their position - allow the strength of temptation - and em- phasise the efficacy and necessity of prayer. Many things in the book are debateable and inspire thought or grounds for controversy, e.g. is prayer a 'rational instinct' 126</page><page sequence="2">Reviews (Part I) or rather a phase of the instinct of gratitude or self preservation ? Exception must be taken to the following : 4 He has placed at the door* (of the Wedding- Feast) 4 the supernatural gifts of Faith and of all other graces : faith itself being the first gift of Grace (p. 211-212).' This smacks Ã²f the condemned proposi- tion (Clement XI, prop. 27 Quesnel) that 4 Faith is the first grace.' No doubt the author means first graces are given, to lead the recipient to Faith. Thus the author ought to make this meaning clear. Again : 4 The contents of the divine mes- sage which is accepted by Faith ... is whatever God has revealed ' (p. 214). This should be 4 whatever God has revealed to His Church.' Private revelation is at least doubtfully an object of Faith and certainly not one of obligation. Other things we pass over. Darwin might better be described as an agnostic than ani atheist - it is hardly an argument against Anthropomorphism to say : 4 You cannot make anything like to yourself by simply eyeing it or knowing it ' (p. 30) etc. The copious texts quoted are apt and convincing. These alone ought to induce everybody to possess the book. The book is a mine of information, yet it is very regrettable that no references are given for quotations, except they be Scripture. These Talks are always solid and intellectual, and the work as a whole is a move in the right direction. Such as have patience to read the book carefully and digest it will be amply repaid for their pains. J. B. B.</page></plain_text>
