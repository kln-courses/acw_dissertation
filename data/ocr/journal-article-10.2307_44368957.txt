Reddy Northwestern University Abstract The Abhisheka Ritual exhibits a distinctive temple liturgy and the worldview of Vaishnava Pāftcarātrins, a sectarian community of Vishnu followers dating back to the fourth century BCE. This study focuses on the phenomenological and sociological aspects of a contemporary performance of the Abhisheka Ritual at the Venkatesvara Temple in Pittsburgh, in 2002. By examining the major ritual units, such as the image worship, the Kalaśa mandala, the Vaishnava fire ceremony, and the Abhisheka consecration, I discuss the ways in which these units form the different 'frames of contextual ity' of the Abhisheka Ritual. I further analyze how these different religious phenomena have shaped the structural pattern and the multiple meanings of the ritual, thus contributing to its comprehensive 'meaningfulness.' Finally, I discuss the ritual in the social setting of a diaspora by proposing that the Hindu immigrant community and religious rituals are interdependent agencies and play a significant role in America in building both Hindu temples and the solidarity of immigrant communities. 1. INTRODUCTION Hindu Brahmanical rituals cannot be understood as a unified phenomenon. The processual development of rituals in India takes place in different temporal and spatial contexts, with cosmological overtones and under the authority of different theistic sectarian traditions. Because of these varied contexts, rituals comprise a union of religious ideas and concepts inherited both from traditions rooted in the past and newly emerging traditions of Hindu theism. The Abhisheka Ritual is one such example of the Vaishnava liturgy.1 The structural framework of this ritual, both in the text and in practice, is formulated adherence to the religious practices of Vishnu in general and the Vaishnava Pāficarātra sect in particular. Although the present study is based on the contemporary performance of the Abhisheka Ritual at the Sri Venkatesvara Temple in Pittsburgh (SV),2 the ritual is an ancient one that can be safely dated to the seventh century CE, a period that also marks the composition of a new genre of Vaishnava liturgical texts known as the Samhitās . The Abhisheka Ritual is a southern Vaishnava temple ceremony performed according to the Pādmasamhitā ( PaS ), a widely used liturgical text in modern South India.3 But its earliest forms can be traced back to the fourth century BCE, a period that also marks the origin of Vaishnava theism in North India.4 The Pāncarātrins and the Bhāgavatas, the two religious communities of North India, who worshipped Vishnu as their Supreme Lord in the centuries preceding the Common Era, are the founding fathers of the distinctive temple liturgy and image worship of Vaishnava theism. This liturgy is practiced today in many Vaishnava temples, albeit with variations. The research for this paper is drawn from the fieldwork conducted during the ritual performance at the SV Temple and interviews with priests and devotees, as well as textual sources. The Abhisheka Ritual is an elaborate public ceremony requiring the organization of several ritual settings; each setting is distinct, both in its structural plan and in its pattern of performed ritual activity. Thus a detailed documentation and a descriptive analysis of each setting are both necessary and important since each unit has its own symbolic connotations and religious significance. These ritual settings not only constitute the frames of the main structure, but their contextual meanings also contribute to the comprehensive 'meaningfulness' of the Abhisheka Ritual. Therefore it is essential to study each unit of the ritual in its own context by following a methodological approach called 'the frame of contextuality' by Fred Clothey.5 Clothey's approach can be applied to the study of a contemporary ritual embodying a 'microhistoric whole' that reflects both the contemporaneous situations of a ritual and its multiple expressions of the past within the larger context of a religious system. The study of frames of contextuality of a particular ritual 1</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 varies depending on what aspect of a ritual one explores. In this paper I wish to focus on the phenomenological and sociological aspects of individual units and the ritual as a whole. Each unit, such as the area image worship or the Vaishnava fire ceremony (yajña ), is analyzed and interpreted within its own contextual frame; this is followed by an analysis of how these different contextual frameworks have shaped the structural pattern and religious meanings of the ritual. I discuss the ways in which the Hindu immigrant community and religious rituals as interdependent agencies contribute to the process of temple-building and to the construction of community solidarity in the lives of immigrants in America. The following sections give the background of the SV Temple, then a systematic description and interpretive analysis of the Abhisheka Ritual and its various units within the Vaishnava Pāncarātra tradition in India; the final section places the ritual in the social setting of the Hindu diaspora in America. 2. THE SRI VENKATESVARA TEMPLE Venkatesvara, one of the manifestations of Vishnu, is the most popular Hindu deity in India. His most famous temple is located in the midst of the Tirumala Hills in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.6 Venkatesvara is also the favorite deity of American Hindus, who have built temples to him in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in Aurora, Illinois, in Calabasas, California, and in Atlanta, Georgia. The SV Temple has a distinctive place among these because it was not only the first Venkatesvara temple built in North America but also the first replication of Tirumala's Venkatesvara temple. Since it was completed in 1977, the Pittsburgh Temple has became a pilgrimage site drawing thousands of devotees annually from across America. Like the Tirumala Temple that has provided guidance as a 'mother temple' to other Venkatesvara temples in India, the SV Temple has also been a mother temple to Venkatesvara temples in America. Within a short period of 25 years, the Pittsburgh Temple has developed its own sacred history. Its location, in the beautiful hilltop setting of Penn Hills in Monroeville, is sanctified by the application of Indian sacred geography to the American landscape. The temple is described as the 'Tirumala of the Western Hemisphere;' in another illustrious Indian epithet Pittsburgh is called the 'land of fire sacrifice' ( yajñabhümi ).7 The temple's location about 12 miles from the confluence of three local rivers (Allegheny, Ohio, Monongahela) is described as a sacred geographical feature replicating the sacred confluence of three rivers in North India (Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati). The conventional Hindu practice of sanctifying a place or a temple in terms of its geographical setting has been followed for the Hindu temples of America.8 The SV Temple is constructed in southern architectural style with the drāvida vimāna towers atop main shrines and a multi-tiered tall gopura gateway facing the east. While the American construction company built the outer frame of the temple building, temple architects from India designed the architectural ornamentation and sculptural program by following prescriptions given in medieval Śilpa Sastra texts. Officially, the temple received the rites of consecration including the kumbha-abhisheka, literally the 'sprinkling with the waters of kumbha pots,' in 1977. The main shrine houses a black basalt image of Vishnu as Venkatesvara, and its flanking shrines are dedicated to his divine consorts. In 1976 the image of Venkatesvara received the rites of consecration, including the opening of the eyes and the establishment of the breath. Rituals such as public ceremonies, daily and periodic rites, and samskāra rites (sacraments) of devotees are performed according to the Samhitā or Agama texts. The temple priests are originally from a South Indian Brahmin community and are trained in Hindu brahmanical traditions and Vaishnava temple liturgy. For the occasional public ceremonies such as the consecration of images or the Abhisheka Ritual, a group of experienced priestly scholars are invited from India to conduct the rituals according to the Agamic traditions of South India. The temple was praised even by religious gurus from India for its authentic position in the establishment of orthodox brahmanical doctrine and practice in a foreign land. Sri Sugunendra Theertha Swamiji of the Udupi monastery writes: We are immensely impressed to see such powerful sannidhãna [presence] of that Venkateshwara in Pittsburgh. We feel the reason behind this is, the temple was established according to Aagamaas and is functioning accordingly and [consequently] the Bhakti Ganga [the devotion of the River Ganges] is pouring in through priests and devotees from all over America.9 2</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 From a demographic perspective, the Pittsburgh Temple has gained a special place as the first Hindu temple in America, a fact that is often stated in the temple publications and referred to by others. Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum sent the following message on the occasion of the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Pittsburgh Temple: We recognize this was the very first Hindu Temple in North America and its unique, ornate construction draws a lot of attention. Also, it is impressive to note that over 125,000 devotees attend there every year. In addition to those of the Hindu faith, students and scholars of other religions interested in learning about formal worship in the Temple also visit. On behalf of the United States Senate, 1 wish you all the best in your efforts to promote peace and understanding between all of the citizens not only in your community, but throughout the world.10 The Pittsburgh Temple has also become an active community cultural center with established programs and services including lectures in religion and spirituality, cultural performances, educational programs, and summer youth camps. The Temple publishes a magazine series under the title Saptagirivāni (the Voice of Seven Hills), which focuses on topics such as the building activities of the temple, religious services, ritual events, and publishes general topical articles on religion and culture. 3. THE ABHISHEKA RITUAL (sahasra-kalaśa-abhisheka) During the Labor Day weekend of 2002, the SV Temple celebrated the completion of 25 years of history with the performance of a series of public ceremonial rites. The Abhisheka Consecration Ritual is the main ceremony, performed for five days by a group of priests under the supervision of Acarya Ramanujam, an Agama Pundit from South India. The author learned from Ramanujam that the priests and trustees of the SV Temple are very much concerned about authentic performance of the ritual according to instructions given in the liturgical texts. The priests at the Pittsburgh Temple follow the PaS , a Vaishnava Pāficarātra authoritative text, which is widely used as a guide to the construction of Vaishnava temples and the performance of temple rites in India.11 The preparations for the five-day Abhisheka Ritual constitute an elaborate and lengthy project involving the organization of materials for the construction of the ritual settings and for the performance of the ritual itself. The skills of specialists such as sculptors, carpenters, priests, and professionals (devotees) are essential to the orchestration of the various components of the ritual. Janaki Raghupati, a mechanical engineer who helped collect materials for the 1986 Abhisheka Ritual,12 said that the ritual required a wide range of items such as medicinal herbs, metals, precious stones, and objects of gold and silver. The water for the vessels in the Kalaśa mandala was brought from various sources including the Ganges, the confluence of three rivers in Allahabad (Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvati), the confluence of three local rivers in Pittsburgh (Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela), and Atlantic City and Lake Erie. The list goes on. The four ritual settings that form the core of the Abhisheka Ritual are a dais for area images, a Kaloša Mandala constructed from 1 00 1 kalaśa vessels, a house of fire altars {yãga-éãla ), and a Cakra Mandala. These four settings are arranged on a raised square wooden platform in a temporary enclosure to the north of the temple. They are organized on an east- west axis: at the eastern end, the house of fire altars with the Cakra Mandala, and at the western end a dais of area images; between the fire altars and the area dais is the 1 00 1 -Kalaśa Mandala arranged with triple enclosures (See Figure 1 and Plate 1). This arrangement of four ritual units in the Abhisheka Ritual reflects a Vaishnava liturgical practice in which Vishnu is worshipped in four prescribed forms. The PaS refers to worship of Vishnu in four specified ways as: images {bimba), vessels {kumbha or kalaśa), fire ceremony ( homa ), and mandala. There is also a hierarchy of worship of these four forms, with the mandala worship considered to be the best. Th e Abhisheka Ritual comprises these four forms of Vishnu worship. Before the discussion of these ritual units in detail, we should know what ritual events are scheduled during the five days. A three-step procedure is repeated on each day. First, the priests light up the fires on the altars while chanting hymnal mantras and offering oblations of clarified butter (ghee) to Agni (Fire), 3</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 Vishnu, and his various manifestations. Second, they welcome the deities to be present in the Cakra Mandala, in the Kálaša Mandala, and in the area image of Vishnu, while sprinkling the sacred water on all those mentioned. Welcoming the deities to be present in the images or mandatas, accompanied by chanting of mantras, reflects the Hindu-Tantric tradition. Finally, the priests perform an hour-long fire ceremony (Vaishnava yajña) in the house of fire altars while chanting mantras from the Vedas and Vaishnava scriptures, accompanied by ghee offerings to the fires; at the end of the yajña, the offerings consist of grains, herbs, and nuts. The Abhisheka Ritual ends on the fifth day with the Abhisheka consecration of the image of Venkatesvara. The Area Images of Vishnu Vaishnavism places a great emphasis on the image worship of God. The Pāncarātrins provide a theological basis and a rationale for the worship of consecrated images in temples, and this liturgical tradition has been commonly accepted by all branches of Vaishnavism. Within the broad Vaishnava tradition, Lord Vishnu exists in five different forms: as para, vyüha, vibhava, antaryãmin, and areāvatāra. Para Vishnu in his supreme form refers to the all-pervading form of the entire universe, expressed in names like Parabrahman or Paravâsudeva. Vishnu also manifests in the form of y yuhas (emanations) for the cosmological functions of creation, preservation, and dissolution.13 The vibhava aspect represents Vishnu's incarnations on earth, such as Rama and Krishna, while the antaryãmin is the form of Vishnu that resides in the human heart. The areāvatāra, the incarnation of Vishnu in a statue, is the most important form of Vishnu for Vaishnava devotees. In the Vaishnava tradition in general, these area statues are conceived of as real incarnations of Vishnu as he has descended to earth in his many forms; the significance of these area statues is emphasized even more in some later traditions such as the Šrīvaishnava. The PaS emphasizes the significance of image worship: Although Hari (God) is the soul (atina) of all beings born, he draws near (specially) to dwell in images ( pratima ) by the virtue and the greatness of the mantras and the guru of the founder (sthapaka). People entreat Hari in this form for all their wishes. Hence the significance of this consecretion rite. Just as fire permeates (objects) without burning (them) but appears, burns and becomes otherwise useful when evoked by attrition of two pieces of wood, so does Visnu, the All-Pervader, though invisible to uncultivated men, become visible in the statue by the authority of the holder of the mantra. Install therefore Visnu by means of statues made by sculptors according to the rules laid down by the sastras. 14 The statues intended for temple worship are made in accordance with the iconographie rules laid out in the Śilpa Sastra texts. They are suitable for worship in temples only after proper consecration and installation ceremonies - the statue is infused with the spirit of God only after the consecration rites performed with the uttering of mantras. Not only is the statue then fit for worship, but the power that is infused in the statue is held to animate the temple in which it is erected. Two kinds of area statues are worshipped in Vaishnava temples: 'immovable' and 'movable.' An immovable statue is the primary one, installed in the main shrine of a temple. The immovable statue at the Pittsburgh temple is a five-foot stone representation of Venkatesvara. The movable ( utsava ) statues are smaller in size, are made of metals, and are used for festive processions and temple ceremonies. Why is image worship so important in Hinduism and Vaishnavism? What do Hindus see in images? Seeing and worshipping the image of a god in a Hindu context has many layers of understanding.15 The image serves as more than an object of worship: seeing such an image is a way of 'touching' the deity through human eye contact, through a mind full of reverential thoughts in which the aesthetic beauty of the image is savoured and personal contact with the god is made. A devotee may perform these actions during his/her encounter with an image of a deity. And for a devotee, being seen by the image of a god is also equally important because it means being blessed by the god. Devotional worship of an image in a Hindu temple is therefore a two-way process. Further, the incarnation of Vishnu in the image form and the significance of area worship is provided with a theological explanation in later Vaishnava traditions such as the Šrīvaishnava. The material representation of the deity is believed in the Šrīvaishnava tradition to be 'a divine, auspicious form, and composed of a non-material substance that exists only in heaven [Vishnu's heaven Vaikuntha] and in the Šrīvaishnava temple on earth.'16 In other words, the image is not simply considered as a material statue of 4</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 a deity; it is the presence of a personal god embodied with all the auspicious qualities, and it is of transcendent supreme form, yet accessible to devotees in the area form. This accessibility of Vishnu in the area form is discussed by Šrīvaishnava theologians, and Pillai Lokacarya speaks of it in this way: The Lord as an Inner Controller ( antaryamitvam ) is like water deep down in the earth; the Emanation ( vyûha ) is like the sea of milk; incarnations and manifestations on earth ( vibhava ) are like rivers in flood, but incarnations as images ( areāvatāras ) are like deep pools [that are easily accessible].17 Vasudha Narayanan, a scholar of Hinduism and Vaishnava Studies, analyzes the ways in which the metaphor of water is used to interpret the various forms of Vishnu in the above statement. Bodies of water such as the water in the depths of the earth, the sea of milk, and the floodwaters of rivers, corresponding to three of the five forms of Vishnu, are perceived as unpredictable and inaccessible to ordinary people. This is further explicated in the metaphor of floodwaters to describe the occasional incarnations of Vishnu such as Rama and Krishna, who are accessible only during a particular period like the occasional flood, but not always accessible to devotees. But the area image, like a pond, is always accessible to humans on earth. This explains why the area image of Venkatesvara is given so much significance, and why the abhisheka consecration is performed on this immovable statue in the Abhisheka Ritual. During the five- day ritual, the movable statues representing various manifestations of Vishnu are also worshipped; for example, the statue of Vishnu reclining on the Adisesa serpent is honored with all the rites of pūja worship on one day (See Plate 2). The fourth day falls on the birth date of Krishna, so a statue of Krishna is worshipped to celebrate the event. The area statues are beautifully dressed in colorful silk garments and decorated with jewels and flower garlands. After all the worship services to the area statues have been performed at the end of each day, the images are taken in procession around the temple on a chariot embossed with gold-leaf in a floral design. The worship of Krishna in the Abhisheka Ritual raises another interesting issue. It is certainly a new addition to the ritual since the liturgical texts do not include Krishna worship. My discussion of this issue with Acarya Ramanujam, who oversaw the ritual performance at Pittsburgh, gave me a new perspective on the ritual. Ramanujam told me that new additions such as the worship of Krishna are introduced to the ritual according to the 'circumstances of country and time' - religious, theological, social, cultural, or popular contexts. Krishna is the most favored deity in Hinduism in general, and the Vaishnava tradition in particular, but his worship became popular in South India only in medieval times. Another reason for including Krishna worship is that Krishna was instrumental in forming the Bhagavata religion with which the Pancaratra sect shared much common ground, leading to the eventual merging of these two traditions in the early centuries of the Common Era. 8 The Bhagavata religion grew into a strong Krishna religion in medieval times, especially in the South, so it is possible that at one point the worship of Krishna was incorporated into the area program of the Abhisheka Ritual for practical reasons. One of these could be the building of solidarity of the Vaishnava tradition by bringing the followers of Krishna into the Vaishnava fold once again, thus creating a broad-based Vaishnava cultural unity in South India. For the most part, the Abhisheka Ritual is a formal public ceremony performed by the Brahmin priests. Except during the chariot procession of deities in the evening, devotees take little part in it. Ritual purity is strictly maintained and devotees are not allowed on the ritual platform, which is considered a sacred space defined for the purpose of the sacred ceremony in which Vishnu and his cosmic world are worshipped. The Brahmin priests, who act as intermediary agents between gods and devotees, were a characteristic feature of the Vedic Brahmana period (1000 BCE), and they act in this manner even today. At the end of the ritual, devotees are asked to participate in the circumambulatory act around the ritual platform by saying their prayers, and making their offerings to the fire altars. Devotees' active participation becomes more explicit as they follow the chariot procession of statues. They sing devotional songs in praise of God, accompanied by instrumental music provided by tabla drummers, flutists, and clarinettists. The atmosphere is filled with more energy and enthusiasm on the last day of ritual, with more than a thousand devotees attending the abhisheka ceremony of Venkatesvara. 5</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 The Construction of the Kaloša Mandala The next ritual setting that we see as we move away from the area dais is a mandala-like structure, which is created by using silver kaloša vessels. The Mandala is different from the conventional mandatas we are familiar with. It is made by using 1001 vessels to form a complex structure with three enclosures (see Figure 1). These vessels19 are arranged atop wooden boxes, which are organized in such a way as to form a structure made up of a central, middle, and outer enclosure. The boxes serve as pedestals for the kaloša vessels, which are organized in a series of groups; the number and size of boxes and vessels varies from one enclosure to the other. I call this structure the Kaloša Mandala because it is constructed of kalaśas and also to differentiate it from other conventional mandalas that are described later in this paper. The priests followed the PaS for the construction of the Kaloša Mandala, including the sacred diagram and other prescribed rules on the size and number of vessels. The first sight of this unique mandala raises some basic questions. Does the sacred plan of the mandala hold any religious significance? Why is the mandala made of vessels and why silver vessels? How does the Kaloša Mandala relate to other units of the ritual? Let us begin with the plan of the mandala. Anyone with some knowledge of Hindu temple mandalas would immediately recognize the pattern of triple enclosures in the Kalaša Mandala. The first enclosure in the center corresponds to the world of Brahma, followed by the second and third, corresponding to the divine and human worlds. In the center, the world of Brahma is formed by nine groups of kalaša vessels arranged in a square, with each group containing nine vessels, so a total of 81 vessels (9x9 = 81, See Figure 2). The second enclosure, surrounding Brahma's world, represents the divine world and contains a total of eight kalaša groups, arranged in a square; the eight groups correspond to the four cardinal and the four intermediary directions (See Figure 3). The four groups marking the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) each contain 81 vessels (81 * 4 = 324). The four groups in the second set, marking the intermediate directions (south-east, south-west, north-east, and north-west), each contain 49 vessels (49 x 4 =196, See Plate 3). The entire square enclosure representing the divine world thus contains a total of 520 vessels. Corresponding to the human world, the outermost square enclosure is organized into 16 groups of vessels, each of which contains 25 vessels (16 x 25 = 400, See Figure 4). The vessels at the center of each group are filled with prescribed substances and assigned a presiding deity (16x9= 144). In this way, the three enclosures are constructed with a total of 1001 vessels (81 for Brahma's world, 520 for the divine world, and 400 for the human world). The arrangement of the kalaša enclosures corresponds to site plans of Hindu temples, called vāstumandala plans; these mandalas also consist of a set of triple enclosures allotted to the three worlds.20 For the building of Hindu temples, the architectural treatises prescribe two major mandala plans, consisting of 64 geometric divisions in the mānduka plan and 81 in the paramašayika plan. Another vāstu plan is the sthanlinda of 49 divisions. The paramašayika and the sthanlinda plans are most commonly used in South Indian temples.21 As we see, the 81 paramašayika combined with the 49 sthanlinda plan form the basis for the sacred diagram of the Kalaša Mandala. Not only does the Kalaša Mandala with its triple enclosures follow the Hindu temple vāstu plan, but it also draws meaning and symbolism from it. Like the Hindu temple, the Kalaša Mandala represents the microcosmic structure of the macrocosmic universe of a deity, in this case Vishnu. In a cosmological sense, the plan implies the symbolic blueprint of triple worlds, but on a mundane level it also serves the functions of a temple-building. In the Pittsburgh temple the first enclosure is a square sanctum housing the main statue of Venkatesvara. The second enclosure is a large room with built-in small single shrines dedicated to the statues of Sri and Bhu (Venkatesvara' s consorts), and other deities of the Vaishnava patheon. The third and outermost enclosure accommodates all the facilities of the human world: administrative offices, a gift shop, storage rooms, a kitchen, a dining hall, an auditorium and rest rooms. We have already asked why the Kalaša Mandala is constructed of vessels. Indeed, the vessels are the main element of the Abhisheka Ritual, since the ritual itself is involved with the abhisheka consecration of the statue of Venkatesvara by using water and other substances stored in the vessels. The fullness of a vessel is a symbol of abundance. Our next question is what kinds of material substances do those 1001 vessels contain? Is there a pattern in the selection of contents? And why? Let us go back to the numerical structures of our triple enclosures. The central enclosure of Brahma contains a total of 81 vessels. As we know, the 81 are divided into nine groups and each group contains 6</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 nine vessels. Among the 81 vessels, only the central vessels of the nine groups are filled with prescribed substances accompanied by small statues of Vishnu; the rest are filled with pure water. So the central vessels, which contain material substances, are distinguished from the rest, which contain water. What about the biggest kalaśa vessel that sits in the centermost group of nine vessels? This kalaśa is much bigger than the rest of the vessels in the Kalaśa Mandala, and it is wrapped with a beautiful silk cloth and filled with precious stones, metals, fragrances, medicinal herbs, and fruits. This centermost vessel is singled out because it symbolizes the supreme form of Vishnu, ruler of the triple enclosed world. He is the highest of all, so his kalaśa is large and is numbered 1, as a parallel to the temple plan where the main statue of Venkatesvara stands in the innermost sanctum of the temple; here, the kalaśa represents the supreme form of Vishnu that sits in the innermost enclosure of Brahma (see Figure 2). We know the Kalaśa Mandala represents the layout of the temple itself; this is further emphasized by the relationship between kalaśa 1 and its eight surrounding kalaśa groups. The central kalaśa in each of the eight groups is given importance by providing it with a small statue of Vishnu and also sacred substances. In contrast, kalaśa 1 does not contain the statue of Vishnu, because it represents his impersonal form and is the vital center of the Mandala, whereas the statues placed in the eight groups represent the manifested forms of that impersonal Vishnu. The idea beyond this arrangement is that Vishnu is present both as transcendent and as immanent in the material forms of statues. One hundred and forty-four vessels out of the 400 contain a wide range of blessed substances such as clay, tree bark, seeds, grains, roots of medicinal and fragrant plants, and lotuses; the remaining 256 vessels are filled with pure water (See Figure 4). One important feature is that the last vessel in the human world is filled with precious metals such as gold, silver, and stones, as is true for kalaśa 1 in the world of Brahma. The Mast vessel' means the one reached at the very end of the clockwise circumambulation around the human world. The consecration rite ends with the use of this last vessel. The structure of the Kalaśa Mandala also implies the structure of Hindu cosmology. In Hinduism, the creation projects from the abstract centrality to the peripheral multiplicity, which is displayed through the worlds of divine and human emerging from the central enclosure of Brahma. Now we understand why the central vessel in each of the nine groups in the divine and human worlds contains a small statue representing one of the incarnations of Vishnu. Likewise, these nine vessels are filled with precious materials and sacred substances when compared to the rest that have water only. Water is also a significant element in the Kalaśa Mandala. About 700 vessels out of the 1001 are filled with water drawn from various sources of rivers and oceans, both in India and in the United States, including water from sacred Indian rivers such as the Ganges and the waters from the confluence of three rivers in both countries. This water should be understood in two ways. The water from the vessels is used as the final element of purification of the body of Venkatesvara after bathing him with other kinds of substances. The water in the vessels is invested with life-force (prāna ) through the transmission of power drawn from the continuous performance of the fire ceremony and the chanting of mantras for five days. When the statue of Venkatesvara is consecrated with these vessels of water on the final day of ritual, it is believed that the statue draws the power of the life-force that is invested in the water. In summary, the Kalaśa Mandala represents the transitory mandala of the SV temple itself. It is both the temple and a replica of Vishnu's created world. The SV temple in the form of Kalaśa Mandala is sanctified, perhaps purified through the rituals and the chanting of mantras. The temple is blessed. The sanctified water in the vessels is used for the Abhisheka Consecration of the statue of Venkatesvara, so the deity who lives in the temple is also consecrated. The Vaishnava Yajña (Fire Ceremony or Agnihoma ) The Vaishnava yajña is the last unit of the Abhisheka Ritual. Discussion will focus on the structural layout and theological significance of the house of fire altars (yaga-śala) and the Cakra Mandala ( cakrābja - mandala), and the performance of the fire ceremony (yajña ) as well. The House of Fire Altars (yaga-śala) If one were familiar with a Vedic Agnihotra ritual, one would immediately recognize the presence of fire altars in the yaga-śala. One would wonder about the relationship of the Vedic Agnihotra ritual to the 7</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 Vaishnava yajña. The question of relationship arises because Vishnu was not a prominent deity in the Vedas and he was not part of the Agnihotra ritual. Why then is Vishnu worshipped at fire altars? What is the connection between Agni (Fire) and Vishnu? If one were to observe keenly the structural layout of the fire altars, deeper questions would arise. Why are there are five altars compared to the three altars in the Agnihotra ritual? Why are the fire altars labeled with a particular set of names of Vishnu? Why is a mandala placed in the midst of the five altars? The first step is to chart the structural layout of the fire altars, the meanings associated with them, and any theological significance they bear within the Vaishnava tradition. The Vaishnava yajña uses five fire altars, designated as Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and last, Narayana and his consort Mahalakshmi. The five altars are arranged in a specified shape, collectively referred to as the 'house of fire altars,' placed at the eastern end of the platform. The square altar or kunda (caturasra kundam) for the supreme form of Vishnu known as Vasudeva, the semicircular kunda (chāpa kundam) for Samkarsana, the circular kunda (vritta kundam) for Pradyumna, the triangular kunda (trikona kundam) for Aniruddha, and the lotus-shaped kunda (padma kundam) for Narayana and Mahalakshmi. The conceptual basis for the Vaisnva yq/wa comes from the vyüha doctrine of emanation in Pāficarātra theology.23 According to the vyüha doctrine, Vishnu manifests in the form of emanations for the cosmological functions of creation, preservation, and dissolution. The names of the emanated forms are: Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Vasudeva is the godhead of the vyüha cosmological process and is endowed with six qualities: knowledge (jñana), strength (bala), lordship (aisvarya), heroism (vîrya), power (śakti), and splendor (tejas). From him the three emanations manifest (Samkarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha). The six qualities are then divided among Vasudeva' s three emanations; knowledge and strength are attributed to Samkarsana; lordship and heroism to Pradyumna, the third emanation; and power and splendor to Aniruddha, the fourth emanation. Each of the three emanations has a dual function: both cosmological and theological or ethical. The fire altars in the Vaishnava yajña represent these manifested emanations of Vishnu. The vyüha emanations also represent different cosmological levels. The series of vyüha emanations representing the highest level of creation is called 'pure creation' (śuddha) and those below this are 'mixed creation' (miśra) and 'material or impure creation' (ašuddha). Each vyüha has a cosmological function in regard to the material creation, which manifests through Pradyumna. Aniruddha is responsible for the preservation of the universe and Samkarsana for the dissolution of the universe. As already mentioned, the vyüha emanations of Vasudeva are responsible for the creation, preservation, and dissolution of universe. From the theological (and devotional) point of view, Vasudeva manifests through the emanations in order to make himself accessible to his devotees. The tradition further emphasizes that devotees who worship and meditate on each of these emanations in ascending order will reach the supreme form of Vasudeva. In the Vaishnava yajña, the four altars are dedicated to Vasudeva and his three emanated forms, and they are honored through the worship and the offerings paid to the altars. The fifth altar is the lotus altar dedicated to Narayana and Mahalakshmi. We know Narayana is not part of the vyüha cosmology, and the placement of his altar next to the altar of Vasudeva raises an interesting question. Why Narayana is given such a significant place in the yajña needs an exploration of another layer of Vaishnava tradition. In post-Vedic literature Narayana is identified with the cosmic P urus ha of the Rigveda (RV. 1 0.90). Purusha Narayana is mentioned to have conceived a 'five-day sacrifice' as a means of 'obtaining superiority over all beings and becoming all beings.'24 Narayana is identified with Vishnu in the Nârayanîya section of the Mahãbhãrata.25 In most of the Vaishnava religious literature, Narayana is perceived both as the supreme form of Vishnu and the teacher of the Pāficarātra tradition; his altar next to Vasudeva confirms his highest position in Vaishnavism. What we see in the Vaishnava yajña is the Pāficarātra articulation of the Vedic Agnihotra ritual into a Vaishnava variation of fire ceremony in which Vishnu was honored as the supreme cosmic God and as the ultimate recipient of all Vedic sacrifices. The Vaishnava yajña confirms the cosmological emanation theory, according to which Vishnu is overlord of the universe, he who through his manifested forms performs cosmological functions. The Cakra Mandala, placed in the center of fire altars, represents the mandalic universe of Vishnu. The four altars encircling the Cakra Mandala represent Vishnu's cosmological emanations through Vasudeva. 8</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 The Cakra Mandala ( cakrābja-mandala ) The worship of the Cakra Mandala in the Vaishnava ritual is a common practice, but what is unique here is its place in the midst of the fire altars. The Cakra Mandala is constructed using five colors of rice atop a raised square wooden platform (vedi). The Mandala consists of a wheel and a lotus in the center, surrounded by a square enclosure with openings at the four cardinal directions. This is Vishnu's Mandala, intended to represent his various aspects, including his body image, his consorts, his retinue, his weapons, and his ornaments. He is the innermost center of the Mandala, which is the pericarp of an eight-petal lotus. The twelve lotus petals in one of the surrounding circles represent his twelve 'limbs,' including not just his arms and legs but also his heart, head, tuft of hair, etc. His consorts are placed on his right and left sides facing the northern and southern directions of the Mandala. In the outer square enclosures are placed garlands of flowers, and conch shells are drawn at the directional points.26 Before worship, the Mandala is ritually purified by sprinkling water on it and reciting mantras. Mantras are directed to specific places and images on the Mandala while the mantra-reciting priests imagine that each of these sacred objects is arising from Vishnu. Then the mantras are mentally visualized in anthropomorphic forms and are worshipped by various offerings, such as arghya (a mixture of blessed liquids), pãdya water (for ritual washing of the feet of sacred statues), flowers, and fragrances. In this way, the priests welcome Vishnu and his retinue to be present in the Mandala during the ritual by chanting the mantras of Vishnu together with the associated sacred gestures ( nyãsa ).27 Vishnu is welcomed to be present and worshipped in the Mandala. The Mandala' s significance is clearly emphasized by its position in the center of the fire altars. It is a representation of the impersonal form of Vishnu, in other words, his supreme manifestation. Conceptually, the fire altars can be seen as cosmologica! emanations from the Cakra Mandala of Vishnu. The Cakra Mandala together with the fire altars conveys the first stage of the cosmological process, the 'pure' creation, whereas the Kaloša Mandala represents the second stage, the 'mixed' creation. The Performance of the Vaishnava Yajña (Fire Ceremony) The fire ceremony begins with the lighting of the fires in all altars by the first flames produced by friction from two pieces of wood. The fire ceremony proceeds continuously for four days to invest the water and vessels with prāna or life-force in preparation for the bathing of Venkatesvara at the climax of the ritual on the fifth day. The priests, including senior preceptors appointed for this ritual, proclaim the ritual invocation (sankalpa) while offering the sacred flame (arti) to the center vessel of Vishnu and all the vessel groups in the Kaloša Mandala. The hymnal chanting consists of both Vedic and Agamic mantras uttered at the very beginning of the fire sacrifice, which pay homage to Agni/Fire, as well as to Vishnu, his vyüha emanations, his incarnations, and his weapons. The chanting is accompanied by the offering of oblations of clarified butter and firewood to the fires 1000 times. At the end of each day, the priests carrying the pūrnāhuti offerings28 circumambulate the entire ritual platform while chanting hymns. The priests then offer the pūrnāhuti offerings to all the fires (See Plate 4). The participating attendees are also asked to follow the circumambulatory route of the priests, and offer yellow rice grains to the fires. The Vaishnava yajña concludes with a ritual act called the complete offering (sampūrna-pūrnāhuti) to the five fires. There is a marked difference between the offerings of the preceding four days and the complete offering of the fifth day. The difference is not only in the nature and proportion of the contents of the offerings but also theology. The contents of the offerings on four days are smaller in amount and less in material value. The offerings of the fifth day contain precious materials such as gold, silver, and gems along with the usual offerings of grain, herbs, and nuts. The complete offering reiterates the idea that one should surrender completely to Lord Vishnu, which means that one should sacrifice all material possessions to him, holding nothing back. Sacrificing material possessions means that one is disciplined in senses and mind, and devoted to Vishnu with a detached regard to worldly desires. By controlling the mind and senses, a complete surrender (prapatti) to Vishnu is made, the ultimate goal of a Vaishnava devotee. 9</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 The Abhisheka Consecration Ritual The climax of the five-day ritual is the abhisheka ceremony performed to the statue of Venkatesvara. The fifth day begins with the usual procedure of invocations and offerings to the fires, the Cakra Mandala and the Kalaśa Mandalas. The proclamation of the great ritual intent ( mahãsankalpa ) marks the start of the abhisheka consecration. The chief priest utters the mahãsankalpa and it is repeated aloud by the participants. The utterance of ritual intent is an ancient custom of Brahmanical tradition. It pinpoints the time, place, and purpose of the ritual as: 'in the country of Bhratavarsa [the ancient name of India], in the country of America, in the Kaliyuga [the present Hindu time cycle], in the first part of Manu's period [the periodic cycle of first-born king], in the year 2002, the abhisheka ceremony with 1001 kalaśa vessels is performed to Lord Venkatesvara for the sake of world welfare and prosperity.'29 The ritual intent relates the spatial and temporal contexts to the present ritual performance. Following the ritual intent, the focus is directed to the Kalaśa Mandala and the area statues. The abhisheka ceremony is conducted simultaneously to the statue of Venkatesvara in the temple and the movable statues of himself and his consorts Sri and Bhu on the Kalaśa platform. The astonishing aspect of Pāficarātra liturgical texts is their detailed prescriptive instructions for each small rite; for example, the priests have to follow specific prescriptions on a particular order of selecting the vessel substances from the worlds of gods and of Vishnu in the Kalaśa Mandala. The priests first perform the conventional 16 steps of worship ( pūja ) to the statues of Venkatesvara before the start of the abhisheka rite. In contrast to the construction of the Kalaśa Mandala, which begins with the central enclosure of Vishnu, the ritual ablution begins with the human world and the order is reversed: the vessels that contain clay material in the human world enclosure are the first ones to be selected for the sacred bathing ritual; the water-filled vessels in this enclosure are saved for the second round. In the divine world enclosure, the vessels containing material substances in the east are selected first, followed by the vessels placed in the south, west, and north, respectively. The 49 vessels in the intermediary spaces are the next to be used, beginning with the south-east vessels and ending with the north-east ones. In Vishnu's enclosure, the priests first use the vessel substances in the east, and continue in a clockwise direction, using in turn the vessel substances placed at the south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east directions. The substances in the central vessels of all vessel groups in the three enclosures are used next. Finally, the central vessel of supreme Vishnu, containing precious stones and metals, is used to bathe the statue of Venkatesvara. All remaining vessels that are filled with pure water, from both the divine and human world enclosures, are now used for the sacred bath. The bathing ritual of Venkatesvara, involving all 1001 vessels, ends with the last vessel from the human world, containing precious materials. After the last vessel of the 1001 vessels has been used, the statue of Venkatesvara is bathed with a number of vessels of turmeric-water. The ritual ends with proper propitiation to Venkatesvara with offerings of ghee ( mahāhāvis ); these oblations of ghee, firewood, and four types of cooked rice are offered to the fire accompanied by the hymnal chanting of purushaśiikta and Agamic verses. What do we make of the Abhisheka Ritual and the abhisheka consecration of Lord Venkatesvara? What does it mean to the performing priests and attending devotees? Writing about the comprehensive interpretation of a ritual and its multiple meanings, Fred Clothey comments: The interpretative process starts with the ritual itself - with that which is manifest. When we ask what is seen (or, for that matter, heard, touched, or smelled) and what it means, seeing starts to grope toward comprehension. The harder we look and the better we see, the more apt we are to recognize that every ritual (or any other religious phenomenon) may have almost as many meanings as there are human beings for whom it is meaningful. Meaning is inevitably plural and, like ritual itself, is dynamically processual - a verbal in constant flux rather than a frozen and finite noun.30 The complex nature and the association of different layers of meanings with the Abhisheka Ritual invite a number of hermeneutical possibilities. Each ritual unit conveys its own fabric of meaning and religious significance, and when all the meanings and the contextual phenomena of all units are 10</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 considered, the total meaning of the Abhisheka Ritual begins to unfold. These meaningful connotations may have drawn from cosmological, theological, ritual, and devotional contexts. The implied cosmological meanings in the Abhisheka Ritual are reminiscent of the ideas of cosmic Purusha and the creation in the Rigveda. The creation in the Vedic cosmology is produced from the sacrifice of the body of the Cosmic Person (Purusha); the creation is not from nothing (ex nihilo ) in Vedic religion and Hinduism. The idea of the sacrifice of cosmic Purusha is also conceptualized in the symbolism of a Hindu temple. Whenever a Hindu temple is built, it is implied that a new creation is being manifested because a temple symbolizes the microcosmic home of a deity's universe. For this reason, an image of the vāstu-purusha (person of the site) is placed beneath the foundation of the temple as a symbol of the purusha' s sacrifice for the new creation, which is the temple itself. The renewal of periodic creation is necessary to stabilize the process of creation on a cosmic level, and to energize the power of the temple and also its image in the material world. The Abhisheka Ritual is the ritual of renewal of the creation in which the cosmic forms of Vishnu and his tripartite world are created, worshipped, and offered for the rejuvenation of the image of Venkatesvara and his temple. Whatever is created from that cosmic Supreme has to be returned to him. It is this phenomenon, central to Hinduism, which is adopted in the Vaishnava ritual. The Abhisheka Ritual reflects the Vaishnava theological concept that Vishnu in his universal manifestation pervades everything, including the five elements of air, fire, water, earth, and ether. The notions of Vishnu's all-pervading universal manifestation and the dynamics of Vaishnava cosmology are conceptualized in the framework of the Cakra Mandala, the house of fire altars and the Kalaśa Mandala. The arca image worship conveys the well-known Vaishnava concept of his ready accessibility ( saulabhya ) to the human world. His immanence in the material world is further reflected in all kinds of solid and liquid substances carried by the vessels. In this way the Abhisheka Ritual facilitates the worship of both the manifest and unmanifest forms of Vishnu. From a ritual point of view, the Abhisheka Ritual is designed to reconsecrate the area statue of Vishnu in order to rejuvenate the prāna or life-force that was invested in it at the first such ceremony. The purpose of the periodic consecration rites is to rejuvenate the energy of the image in a way that restores the living presence of God in the image and so reanimates the temple. On another level, it ritually absolves any mistakes inadvertently made in conducting religious services or in the construction of the temple, and alleviates any calamities afflicting a community or the world. The Vaishnava ideologies of bhakti (devotion) and grace are also explicitly conveyed in the Abhisheka Ritual. The Vaishnava bhakti reiterates the idea that loving devotion is a reciprocal process between God and humankind. The Puranic literature narrates that Vishnu took the manifestation of Venkatesvara for the protection of the world in the degenerate Kali Yuga. Venkatesvara is worshipped for the grace he bestows on humankind, and for his blessings that sustain the prosperity of the world. In turn, humanity should show selfless love and devotion to Venkatesvara by expressing its complete surrender ( prapatti ). This idea is more directly conveyed through the offering of the material substances from the Kaloša Mandala's triple worlds to the abhisheka consecration of Venkatesvara, which is a gesture of humanity's love and surrender with devotion to Lord Vishnu. A complete surrender to Lord Vishnu means taking refuge (šaranāgatī) in him alone as the kernel of Vaishnava theology. 4. THE ABHISHEKA RITUAL IN THE DIASPORIC SOCIAL SETTING No ritual is performed in the same way in any given period: some changes or additions are inevitably made every time a ritual is performed, and ritual boundaries are susceptible to modifications according to different spatial and temporal settings. The main elements and core meanings of a ritual may not undergo a complete modification, but it is possible to rearticulate and reinterpret the meanings of a ritual in a particular context. The Abhisheka Ritual that we see today has evolved and matured over 1500 years through a process called 'traditionalization.' This means that the contemporary Abhisheka Ritual might have undergone a process of criticism, rationalization, and judgment before developing into the formal brahmanical rite we see today. The Abhisheka Ritual belongs to the Pāncarātra liturgical tradition of more than 2000 years. The Pāficarātra liturgy is accepted by most of the Vaishnava sectarian branches, though there are some 11</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 differences in its framework and theological basis in the traditions of these different sects. Pāficarātrins also produced a vast compendium of liturgical texts in different periods and different geographical environments. Although these texts have a common historical descent and common thematic subjects, they are distinctive enough for a Pāficarātra ritual performed in a South Indian temple to differ from the same ritual performed at another temple depending on what liturgical texts those temples follow. For example, the major Vaishnava temples at Sri Rangam, Ranchi, and Melkote in South India follow a specific Pāficarātra text for their temple liturgy and ritual practices. Moreover, each temple has a long established history of its own, so the performance at these temples would differ in some ways because of some aspects of temples' history, for example if a legend or belief or local tradition had become integrated into the structure of the ritual. Rituals differ for other reasons. The Bhāgavatās' performance of a Pāficarātra ritual in the Vishnu temple at Deogarh in North India in the fourth century CE might differ in many ways from the same performance by Śffvaishava Brahmins in the Ranganatha temple at Sri Rangam in the South in the twelfth century CE. Here a ritual is performed at two temples belonging to two different sectarian traditions (the Bhāgavatās and the Šrīvaishnavas), in different periods and different geographical settings, so differences between two such performances are to be expected. But one common feature that rituals share in any Indian period or geographical setting is that they can be seen as the agent of cultural unity. We encounter a new situation with the Abhisheka Ritual at the Pittsburgh Temple because it is a contemporary South Indian ritual performed in the social setting of a Hindu diaspora. This raises a number of interesting questions beyond the continuity and change discussed above. First of all, from being the agent of cultural unity in India, the ritual has become an agent in the building of community solidarity in its American context. When the SV Temple performed the Abhisheka Ritual in 1986, it drew more than 5000 devotees from all over America, whereas the 2002 ritual drew over 1000. The difference in the number of participants raises another issue, but our concern here is to explore what factors contributed to the change of a ritual's function in a diasporic social context. In order to do this we need to look at the broader picture of Hindu immigration in America and the process of temple-building. Then we examine the question of how the Abhisheka Ritual relates to this process. What role does it play in creating a cultural or religious awareness among Hindu immigrants? Does it contribute in any way to building solidarity in the Hindu community? The process of Hindu temple-building in America began in the 1970s, a decade after the 1965 Immigration Act allowed Asian immigration. Most of the Hindus who settled in America at that time were educated professionals in medicine, engineering, and the sciences, and the initial years in their adopted home were preoccupied with education, career development, and family settlement. They realized the need for temples and community-building, however, when they had children growing up in an alien cultural environment. As a new ethnic minority, the major concerns of Hindu immigrants in 1970s were: 1) the establishment in the new setting of the cultural and religious traditions they brought with them; 2) the building of a strong Hindu community that could create a Hindu way of life in this social setting; and 3) the creation of a Hindu identity and an awareness of Hinduism in America. In the past three decades, Hindu immigrants have been involved in these activities through different channels: building Hindu temples, founding Indian cultural associations, and Hindu representation in multi-faith organizations.31 Although it has been only three decades since Hindu temple-building began, a normative process has developed in which certain characteristics of the temple-building movement in America are apparent. The process in any city or town begins with a group of immigrants forming into a society; they then become pioneers in fundraising, purchasing land, and finally building. They seek guidance from the established Hindu temple trustees and from state Endowment Departments in India. In Pittsburgh's case, the temple society sought the assistance of the Tirupati temple in religious matters, architecture, and financial support. Public ceremonies such as the consecration rites of temples and the Abhisheka ceremony of images create a momentum by drawing thousands of immigrants together. Hindu people settled in different states of America have the opportunity to involve themselves in activities that create a sense of community solidarity. Diana Eck, a pioneering scholar of Hinduism and American pluralism, writes about the Hindu community's involvement in the consecration rites of the Lakshmi Temple in New England: 12</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 For Hindu immigrants to America, the process of building a temple is simultaneously the process of building a community. In New England, the consecration rites became the occasion for drawing hundreds of volunteers - men and women, children and elders - into creative participation in the life of the new temple. They applied themselves to tasks sublime and mundane: assisting the dozen priests with their ritual duties, chanting hymns and devotional songs, stringing lights, threading a multitude of flower garlands, cooking lemon rice for thousands of visitors, sweeping and cleaning at the end of each day, at the outset of each phase of the ritual ... During the climactic weekend of the consecration rites, North Indians celebrated with devotional bhajan singing, while those from the South sang the songs of the Tamil poet Tyagaraja. By the time the sacred waters were sprinkled at the end of the ritual, a richly variegated Hindu community had come together at New England's first temple. In a real sense, building a temple had begun to build a new Hindu community.32 When the Abhisheka Ritual was performed at Pittsburgh Temple in 2002, Hindus busied themselves with the kind of activities that Eck describes. Several groups worked for months on the preparations. One group was in charge of collecting all the necessary items, another worked with priests in the organization of the ritual space, and a third took responsibility for transportation facilities. One group managed the decorations and arrangement of flower garlands, another undertook to fill the 1001 vessels with material substances, one more worked on the sponsors of the ritual, and several groups assisted cooks in the preparation of food during the five days of ritual. An enormous amount of time, energy, and commitment was required from the community. The Abhisheka Ritual shows the people in action in the joyful building of a new community, aided perhaps by the spirit of American volunteerism. There is also a spiritual dimension to this community service. Often the community-builders are heard exclaiming a well-known Hindu religious saying ( manava sevaye mādhava seva), 'service of humanity is the service of Madhava.' All of this is rather different in India, where temple-building and community involvement in it has a quite different history. Educated professionals are not active in the temple-building process, and the ways in which community solidarity develops are also different. In a South Indian temple, for example, a division of labor according to caste is already in place. The architects and sculptors, who belong to a particular caste community, have for centuries been responsible for the construction of temples. A particular community of Brahmins, depending on the region, manages the religious services. The weaver community weaves beautiful garments, and the goldsmith community makes ornaments for temple deities. Some temples have their own flower and fruit gardens. A temple may have a group of Brahmin singers who are responsible solely for devotional singing during worship services. Brahmins, who are culinary experts, prepare delicious food for daily naivedya offerings to deities and prosada offerings to devotees. The administration of temples is operated by the government Endowment Departments. In India, a temple provides an arena in which to build the solidarity of a regional culture and the religious identity of a particular tradition. The caste communities of a region to a large extent contribute to the building of a temple culture that becomes a way of life. This pattern changes in the diasporic context. When Hindu immigrants of different caste communities come to America, they are dispersed to different cities and towns. Caste community culture and regional identity break down, so the focus of immigrant Hindus shifts from a regional-based or caste community culture to the need to build a Hindu community culture or an Indian 'multicultural' community. Temple-building is one of the ways in which this happens. In the process of building a Hindu identity from scratch, immigrant Hindus transcend the boundaries of caste, region, language, and religion that obtained in their former land. We may further relate the issue of transcending boundaries to participating devotees in the Abhisheka Ritual. The ritual is a South Indian ceremony performed by South Indian Šrīvaisnava Brahmins in a South Indian temple. Obviously we would expect more devotees of South Indian origin, who worship Vishnu and Venkatesvara, to participate. While this is to a great extent true, a large number of North Indian devotees also attended the ceremony. Some people I met were originally from central and western India and are followers of Krishna; Venkatesvara became popular in North India only a century ago. It is also interesting to note that there were some American devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). The ISKCON is a new religious movement of Krishna that began in America in the 1960s under the leadership of Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, a religious teacher from North India. This religious organization follows the teachings of a particular sectarian tradition of Krishna ( Gaudiya ), which has a strong following in the Mathura region of central India and the eastern region of Bengal. So the pattern of attendees at the SV temple, the major Hindu temple in Pittsburgh area, draws together 13</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 Hindus of different Indian regional cultures and religious communities, including the American bhaktas of Krishna. The temple and the temple rituals are therefore central to the building of a multicultural community of Hindus in the new land. The transnational religions also undergo some changes or incorporated with some additions in a diasporic context. We see how the Vaishnava priesthood and Hindu immigrants incorporated new ideas into what can be called a process of making sacred history in a diasporic context. The replication of the sacred geography of India mentioned above is an example of this, while the American landscape also partakes in the ritual landscape of Hinduism. The names America and Penn Hills are added to the traditional construction of the great ritual intent of the Abhisheka Ritual. The uttering of the ritual intent at the beginning of every ritual, pointing the locus, cyclical time, and the year in relation to the current performance of a ritual, has been a Hindu Brahmanical tradition for centuries. America becomes part of that tradition. The consecration of the statue of Venkatesvara with the waters of America is another feature that should be noted here. The water in the kaloša vessels is drawn from different rivers, lakes, and oceans of America, which are mingled with the waters of Indian rivers for the consecration of images. The two countries, India and America, are brought together into the Vaishnava ritualization process, which can be seen as one of the characteristic features of diasporic Hinduism. The transmission of another characteristic feature of Hinduism is also beginning to become part of the history of the SV Temple. India has a long tradition of poet-saints and saint-singers who lived at pilgrimage places and temples; they wrote poetry praising the glory of gods and sang that praise with the utmost devotion, love, and longing. Poems and songs are also written praising the 'Lord of Penn Hills,' Venkatesvara. Dasarathi Rangacarya, the state poet of Andhra Pradesh, wrote a Telugu poem in honor of Venkatesvara, which is published in the Pittsburgh's temple magazine. My translation follows. America Tirupati The resident of Pittsburgh and the manifested glory of Penn Hills One who pleases the entire devotional world, Oh! Srinivasa, Prayers to you! Indifferent to White and Black, Lord, you capture the hearts of everyone. You erased the differences between East and West. You taught [us] the whole world is one. The morning wakeup services here [in India], the nightly sleeping services there [in America]; You open eyes in one place, and close your eyes in another. To the manifested Tirupati on Penn Hills in Pittsburgh Thousands of Americans come to your temple. Auspicious One! It is in your presence that the confluence of three rivers Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio meet. All [our] vows of troubles and gifts are only offered to you, Whether dollars or rupees, all are for you. It is not possible for all to cross the seven seas! Because of that may you be incarnated in America.33 This poem is interesting in many ways, especially its tone of universalism. The poet praises Venkatesvara as lord of the universe and calls the world as one in devotion; Caucasians and African- Americans are mentioned as part of that world. 'You erased the differences between East and West' and 'You taught us the whole world is one' give voice to the message of world peace. The transcendental nature of Vishnu as an all-pervading deity whose omnipresence is much stated in the Vaishnava tradition is expressed in this poem in an interesting way. In Hindu temples, the morning services (, suprabātam ) are performed to wake up the deity, and in the evening, nightly services (, sayanotsva ) are performed to prepare the deity for sleep. The poet is addressing Venkatesvara so that the 14</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 God receives both the morning and nightly services simultaneously in India and America. This refers to the time difference of ten and a half hours, which gives India the day and America the night. Vishnu receives his morning rituals at Tirupati Temple, and simultaneously he receives the night rituals in the Pittsburgh Temple. This is a unique situation; it makes sense in a global context, and also gives the poet a metaphor to articulate the idea of God's omnipresence in the diaspora. A similar metaphor is used in regard to the devotees' offerings to God in the form of dollars in America and rupees in India. By such means, the poem reflects the theme of the diasporic God Vishnu, who incarnated on the Penn Hills to bestow his grace on the people of America. He is accessible to all there in America, who cannot cross the seven seas to see him on the hills of Tirupati. Thus we come to see that the functional role of ritual changes in the diasporic context. The change is partly due to the objectives of the temple-building process in America, which are different from that in India. Ritual becomes one of the ways Hindu temple-building contributes to the building of a Hindu community or an Indian multicultural community. Drawing more than 5000 Hindus from all over America during a weekend to attend the Abhisheka Ritual on the Penn Hills of Monroeville in 1986 is not a small event, considering the brief 20 years Hindu immigrants had been in this country. Irrespective of a variation in the regional, communal, and cultural origins in India, the participating attendees in the Abhisheka Ritual demonstrate the dynamic force a ritual has in bringing together different communal groups for a single event. The ritual also creates a cultural and religious awareness among Hindu immigrants, many of whom were never before involved directly with the process of temple-building or the preparatory activities of temple rituals. The temple and its rituals are having a significant impact in creating a cultural and religious awareness among Hindu youth in America. The ritual also brings together the two countries, India and America, on different levels. The inclusion of America in the ritual intent, the use of American with Indian waters in the kaloša vessels, and the poems addressing Vishnu as the God of America are some points to note. On the religious side, the ritual exemplifies the transmission of an age-old Vaishnava tradition from India, rooting itself firmly in the soil of America. In some ways, we can say that the ritual is functioning to build bridges between the two cultures, between the different Hindu immigrant communities, and between the different religious communities. In a diasporic social setting, not only does the functional role of a religion or ritual change, but also the functional role of an immigrant community. 5. CONCLUSION The phenomenological aspects of the Abhisheka Ritual emphasize the relationship of Vishnu and his devotees on many levels. The ritual enables us to construct an imaginative universe in which the world of God and the world of humans are brought together in interactive discourse. The human discourse is expressed through worship, prayer, and sacrifice of all that humanity has to offer to the God. The God's discourse is his blessings on the welfare of humanity, and his immediate accessibility through the image incarnation in a Hindu temple. In the Hindu world this is an ongoing process of God and human discourse in which ritual serves as a reinforcing phenomenal agent. The sociological aspects of the Abhisheka Ritual exemplify the ways in which society or community plays a vital role in the building of a religion in a foreign land, and, vice versa, the functional role of religion and ritual in the lives of a dispersed community of Hindu immigrants in America. The more I think of the temple-building process of Hindu immigrants, and their active role in the organization of rituals, the more I am forced to think of Durkheim's perception that 'religion and society are inseparable and - to each other - virtually indispensable.'34 Endnotes 1 . In Sanskrit the ritual is called sahasra-kalaśa-abhisheka , which literally means the consecration ceremony with one thousand kalaśa vessels [of holy water and other substances]. Technically, this ritual uses 1001 or 1008 kalaśa vessels. In this paper, the 4 Abhisheka Ritual' is referred to the entire performance of the ritual. The 4 Abhisheka Consecration' is used to refer the sacred bathing ritual of the statue of Venkatesvara. The names Vishnu, Venkatesvara, Krishna, and Rama etc are not transliterated. The words mandala, mantra, guru and pundit are not italicized and transliterated since they are now part of the English language. 15</page><page sequence="16">Journal of Ritual Studies 20 (2) 2006 2. The Abhisheka Ritual was first performed at the SV temple in 1986. The ritual was filmed and the SV temple and the University of Pittsburgh produced a video entitled Pilgrimage to Pittsburgh. The funds for the field research were provided by my Andrew Mellon post-doctoral fellowship at Northwestern University. I am thankful to Acarya Ramanujam for discussing some aspects of the ritual in 2002. 3. The Pādmasamhitā ( PaS 1974 &amp; 1982) belongs to the earlier group of liturgical texts of the Vaishnava Pāflcarātra tradition. The PaS is dated to the seventh or eighth century CE. Samhitã texts such as the Sãttvãta, Paushkara , and Jayãkhya are the earliest texts and are known as the three gems of the Pāftcarātra liturgy. Although the PaS does not belong to this group, it is the most widely used text in the Vaisnava temples because of its clarity and its unambiguous presentation of the materials. For a summary of the Pãncarãtra texts, see Smith (1978-79: 45-58); Gonda (1977: 1-139); Matsubara (1994: 15-34); Varadachari (1982: 117- 219). 4. For early Vaishnavism, see Bhandarkar (reprint 200 1 : 1-42); Das Gupta ( 1 93 1 : 93-1 1 6, 344-58, 653-79; 1 932: 64-84); Srinivasa (2000); Flood (1993: 103-47). For later Vaishnava traditions, see Narayanan (1987); Carman &amp; Narayanan (1989); Rangachari (1931). 5. The various methods of interpreting rituals discussed by Clothey (1988: 147-62) have been consulted for this study, especially in developing the contextual frame of the Kalaśa Ritual. 6. 'Venkatesvara' means 'Lord of the Venkata Hills*. The Venkata Hills, a series of seven hills, form a part of the Eastern Ghats. The temple of Venkatesvara and the township of Tirumala, now a pilgrimage center, are situated on the seventh hill. The area surrounding the foothills of Tirumala has developed into a medium-sized pilgrimage city called Tirupati. More often, Tirumala and Tirupati are used to refer the pilgrimage site of Venkatesvara. 7. Sri Venkatesvara Temple Brochure of 25th Anniversary Celebrations (Pittsburgh: 1976-2001 :1). 8. For Hindu temples in America, see Eck (2001 : 80-141). 9. Saptagirivani (2002: ii). 10. Saptagirivani (2002: viii). 11. The Kalaśa Ritual is discussed in the carya-pãda section of the Pādmasamhitā , Part II (1982: 96-1 10). 12. Video, Pilgrimage to Pittsburgh (1986). 13. S.M. Srinivasa Chari (2000: 212-17) discusses the five forms of Vishnu and the vyüha doctrine in chapter 10. 14. PaS, 3, 26, 2ff., cited Gonda (1977: 76). 15. For Hindu images see Eck (1998: 3-55). 16. Narayanan (1985: 62). 17. Srivacana Bhusanam, sutra 39; cited in Narayanan (1985: 62-3). 18. For the Pāflcarātra and the Bhāgavata relationship, see Matsubara (1994: 1-15). 19. The use of vessels made of materials such as gold, silver, copper, and terracotta is prescribed for the ritual. In the present ritual silver vessels were used to commemorate the 25th foundation celebrations of SV temple. A temple brochure created for this special religious event describes the occasion as the 'silver jubilee celebrations.' 20. The vãstumandala site plans are discussed in Stella Kramrisch's classical work, Part I (1976: 46-50 and 58-61). For the Kalaśa Mandala drawing in this article, PaS Part II (1982), and the Kalaśa plan from the field research at the SV temple were consulted. 21. The use of the sthanlinda plan of 49 squares within the vãstumandala plan of 81 squares is interesting. The 49-square plan is used only in South Indian temples and rituals, and it is especially given greater importance in the Vaikhānasa, an orthodox Vedic sect in the Vaishnava tradition. 23. S.M. Srinivasa Chari (2000: 212-17); Mitsunori Matsubara (1994: 67-130). 24. Śatapatha Brahmano, 13.6.1.1. Jan Gonda (1977: 47); Daniel H. Smith (1964-65: 102-17). 25. X.III, 6, 1, cited in R.G. Bhandarkar (2001: 31). 26. The earlier Pāflcarātra texts, such as the Pauskara Samhitã, give information about the practice of using mandalas for worship in different rituals, from initiation ( dīiksa ) to consecration (pratistha ) of images and temples. The texts suggest many different kinds of mandalas, but most often mentioned (and thus most often used in the rituals) is the Cakra mandala. The Cakra mandala is intended for a sãdhaka or practitioner. Based on the Pauskara, Jayãkhya, and Nâradîya Samhitã texts, Marion Rastelli discusses the use of mandalas and yantras in the Pāflcarātra tradition, in Buhnemann (2003: 1 19-51). 27. The PaS (1982: 60-72) gives a detailed account of how different parts of the Cakra mandala should be worshipped. 28. Pūrnāhuti offerings consist of grains, nuts, herbal roots, and metal objects of gold and silver, which are tied in a cloth and offered to each fire altar. 29. The formulation of the ritual intent can be different from one priest to another in the use of language. The ritual intent in the Abhisheka Ritual of 1986 at Pittsburgh temple is slightly different from the present Abhisheka Ritual. The changes in 1986 ritual intent are: the priest uses the term the 'continent of sacred cow tirthas ' (gotīrthakhanda ) for the ancient name of India (Bhāratavarsha), and for the locus of the ritual, the Anacostia Hills are mentioned instead of America. The cosmic time cycle Kaliyuga and the Manu period remain same in both ritual intents. 30. Clothey (1988: 148). 31. Eck (2001:80-141). 32. Eck (2000: 221-2). 33. Saptagirivani (2002: 49). 34.
