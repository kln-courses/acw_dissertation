(Belgium) IT IS CLEAR that the present conventional laminated glass windshield with a thick plastic interlayer has much improved occupant safety in a car during the "second collision." Yet, the conclusions of official reports dealing with crash analysis, as well as the publications of specialists in automobile safety show that the windshield laceration potential is still a severe disadvantage that ought to be lessened, and if possible elim- inated. We came to the same conclusion when we considered the side and rear windows. Several formulas have been suggested to reduce the risk of injury to occupants who hit the windshield and whose heads contact broken fragments of glass. None of the solutions con- sidered to date seem to be a satisfactory compromise with the manufacturing requirements of mass-produced windshields. It is important to emphasize that a windshield with a very low or even nonexistent laceration potential must still meet other performance requirements, such as good optical quality which does not impair visibility and does not obstruct the view either because of an unforeseen fracture or progressive natural aging. Considerable progress has been made in manufacturing very thin glass of good optical quality strengthened by high safety ABSTRACT This study was part of a research program which aimed to develop a laminated glass windshield with a very weak- or al- most nonexistent- laceration potential. Two types of new safety windshields were tested. They differed only in the strengthening level of the V.H.R. glass used. In both cases, the very thin 0.050 in (1 .2 mm) thick inner sheet and the 0.1 10 in (2.8 mm) thick outer sheet were made of V.H.R. glass. Nevertheless, the glass of the outer ply had a deliberately limited tensile strength. The poly vinyl- butyral plastic interlayer was 0.030 in (0.76 mm) thick. The evaluation of the biomechanical behavior of these wind- shields was made in a laboratory study described in this paper, and in impact tests with a headform free falling on positioned samples. During the impact, the following were recorded or filmed at high speed: the deceleration peak along two orthogonal axes, the resultant severity index relating to the initial impact and to the plow-in, the tearing length of the plastic interlayer, and finally the laceration potential. The latter was evaluated on basis of the laceration rating scale used by Patrick at Wayne State University. A laceration index was given following the number and size of the cuts measured on the two superposed chamois leathers covering the headform. The experimental parameters whose influence was particu- larly studied were temperature, impact velocity, impact loca- tion, and increase of the mechanical strength of the sheets. The research was sytematically carried out in order to com- pare the new windshield safety performances with that of the conventional laminated ones. All the results of the measurements were statistically ana- lyzed: parameters of distribution, lines of regression, analysis of correlations, signification tests, etc. The new safety reinforced laminated windshield might be used as a true passive restraint system if the tensile strengths of the reinforced glass are adjusted. This double performance will have to be developed in a later series of simulated crash tests with anesthetized primates, anthropomorphic dummies and, if possible, human cadavers. 2973</page><page sequence="2">2974 E.

However, it has been shown that the ability to withstand the impact of hard, flying stones is improved when the thickness of the outer sheet and windshield rigidity are increased. This prevents fracture propagation after inden- tations. To find the best compromise, we have established the re- search program described here, with three aims: 1. To study experimentally the parameters affecting the laceration potential of a windshield. 2. To define, for increasing impact velocities, the best com- promise between two antagonistic requirements: high resis- tance to head penetration on one side, and fairly limited severity index with a reasonable peak of deceleration on the other side. 3. To set off the factors that could tum the windshield into a real passive restraint system. This program will be carried out in three successive phases. The first of them is explained here. 1 . Tests of the headform free falling at impact angle on flat samples and full-scale curved windshields. Measurement of the mechanical factors and estimate of the biomechanical charac- teristics of the impact, especially of the laceration index as a function of parameters such as impact velocity, temperature, increase of glass mechanical resistance, etc. The results of the first phase will be used as a basis and orientation for the other two. 2. Impact tests using primates against the various wind- shields selected during the first phase. Estimation of the lacerations together with an x-ray study of the fractures and diagnosis of the cerebral and cervical traumata. 3. Impact tests using anthropomorphic dummies and cada- vers against the same windshields in simulated crashes. The method used for these tests would be similar to that used by Wayne State University. Evaluation of the results gathered can be made by direct and systematic comparison with the experimental data of conven- tional glazing undergoing the same tests under the same con- ditions. This experimentation had two parts: one carried out on flat ♦Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. samples (24 X 36 in) adopted by the Glazing Study Group of the SAE Body Engineering Committee, and one carried out on large windshields fixed in automobile body openings. The increase in safety of the new windshield can be roughly rated by extrapolation based on numerous crash investigations of post- 1966 windshields. LAMINATE CONFIGURATIONS TESTED All of the samples used in the comparative performance study of headform impact can be classified into three types, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 . The thickness of the outer sheet (0.1 10 in) is higher than that of the other very thin V.H.R. windshields that have been described in former papers (1 ,2). Table 2 shows the mean values and statistical distribution of the tensile strengths of the various types of V.H.R. used, as well as for ordinary glassē The variation coefficient as defined by comparison of the standard variation with the mean value ranges about 10% in all cases.

All the samples have the same poly- vinylbutyral plastic interlayer of a thickness of 0.030 in. The adhesion to the glass corresponds to an amount of residual moisture ranging between 0.5-0.6% in weight. FLAT PANELS (TYPE SAE 24 X 36 IN)- IMPACT STUDIES Before studying the performance of large curved windshields, a preparatory experimental step with flat samples was made. This was done in order to: 1 . Rate the relative level of biomechanical performance of the two V.H.R. glazings and to compare it with that of the conventional laminated glazing, with special emphasis on the danger of laceration. 2. Rate of influence of temperature variations on the re- sistance to head penetration and on the resulting effects on laceration. 3. Discover the effect of purely mechanical factors, such as impact localization point, on the characteristics of the head- form impact. SAMPLES, EXPERIMENTAL DEVICE, MEASURING EQUIPMENT, CONDITIONS OF THE TESTS - The samples were flat in three configurations shown in Fig. 1 : conventional laminated glazing, V.H.R. 54 A glazing, and V.H.R. 54 B glaz- ing. Their size (24 X 36 in) was that of the headform impact test as recommended by the SAE Glazing Study Group since 1963-1964(3).

Before undergoing the impact test at low or high tempera- tures, the samples are put in a refrigerator or closet for several hours with a temperature regulator at ±2 C. The experimental device is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of an engine foundation on which a rigid metallic frame, which can be positioned at angle, is mounted. The glass sample is fixed only on its rim between the two gripping jaws of the frame which is fastened by 10 bolts dis- tributed as shown in Fig. 3ģ The clamping moment of each bolt is 2 mkg in order to counteract the effect of slippage on the edges, which would artificially heighten the threshold of tearing and penetration and alter the comparisions made between the tests. The tightening pressure on the rim of the sample was about 10 kg/cm^. The headform (Fig. 4) is rigid and weighs 10 kg. It is similar to the one described in another paper (1), but is equipped with two decelerometers (axial and transversal), which measure the component impact forces in two directions and to draw its résultant. It is covered with a double layer of wet chamois leather (Fig. 5) which is used to rate the laceration index. It is replaced after each test.

It is possible to reach a maximum velocity of 35 mph. As shown by Fig 6, the headform is guided by its outer parts which slide freely along two vertical ropes; the travel of the headform is stopped when the phases of the shock on the glass-initial impact and plow-in-are over. When the head- form hits the glazing, it rolls around its extremities and tilts more and more as it slides on the glass (Fig. 6). The measuring instruments were arranged as shown in Fig. 7. They also included two decelerometers (Kistler model 808 A) and their charge amplifiers, a southern oscillographic re- cording device with luminous spot and paper sensitized to ultraviolet light on which are recorded (Fig. 8): 1 .

The specifications of the instruments are given in the Ap- pendix. The conditions under which the tests were run are: 1 . The impact velocity of the headform was steady and fixed at 20 mph, which corresponds to an impact energy of 40 kg. 2. The samples were positioned at 45 deg off the vertical. 3. The successive temperatures of the samples were: -5, 0, 20, 40, 50, and 70 C. MEASUREMENT OF THE LACERATION INDEX - Measurement Method - Several methods were used to judge the laceration potential of the windshields as they underwent the impact of rigid or articulated dummies. The most common consisted of covering the hard ball simu- lating the skull with a layer of synthetic material and stretch- ing above it one or several chamois leathers. The choice of materials which best simulate the subcu- taneous tissues has been widely discussed, but criteria of choice have not yet been defined (4). The laceration potential is measured by means of the slight scratches, abrasions, and cuts caused on the successive layers by the contact and skidding of the headform face against the glazing. The method used during this study is a well-known one. The layer in direct contact with the wood is made of a 4 mm thick felt (thus fairly thin).

Prior to the test, each chamois is dipped into water and then dried by hand. The top of the headform is covered with two chamois stretched so that no wrinkles appear; these chamois are fas- tened onto the head with a rubber band. After the impact test, the severity of the laceration is esti- mated from a laceration index that has been defined in terms of the alterations measured on each of the layers. Laceration Rating Scale - Several rating scales are used in the research on laceration measured by means of chamois. This study will adopt a rating scale on which the value of the index ranging from 0-10 is linked with the number, depth, and length of the deteriorations. As far as its qualitative definition is con- cerned, it is identical with the one proposed by other authors (5, 6). Maximum . Peak G.

R. PLUMAT, ET AL. However, in order to get away from a more or less subjective evaluation, the index was given for each of the chamois on the basis of the total measurements of the lengths of the cuts in accordance with the quantitative scale shown in Table 4. The total index of laceration is equal to half of the sum of the indexes given to each of the chamois. By these means, the laceration index measured is the mean value obtained from the sum of the measurements made on each chamois. Therefore, the same importance is devoted to each chamois.

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS - Laceration and Rating Scale - The rating scale adopted has two limits: a lower one, index 0; and an upper one, index 10. This difference needs to be taken into account.

This means the lower limit is identical with the minimum below which we may not go. In other words, a negative index, for instance- 1 , would have no meaning. This is however not the case for the upper index (equal to 10), which is not necessarily identical with a maximum of lac- eration. When the index is established, as it is here, on the basis of the measurement of the number, length, and depth of cuts, a figure superior to 10 may be needed to show the real result. Furthermore, the upper limit of the scale does not reflect the degree of danger to which the occupant was submitted as far as disfiguration is concerned. Nor does it give any indica- tion of the degree of reversibility of the damage suffered. Laceration and Changes of Temperature - On conventional glazing and the V.H.R. 54 A glazing, the two sheets break when impacted. In contrast, about half the time, only the outer sheet of V.H.R. 54 B will rupture. The thin inner sheet remains undamaged after having been elastically deformed. (Values are shown in the diagrams by a circled triangle). This very clear and noticeable difference in the behavior of the V.H.R. 54 B, and occasionally of the V.H.R. 54 A (which occurs with the windshields, as will be seen later), will be re- lated to the levels of tensile strength and storable energy men- tioned in Tables 2 and 3. Both V.H.R. glazings proved to be almost indifferent to changes in temperature ranging from -5 to 50 C (23-122 F) at an impact velocity of 20 mph. Under the conditions we adopted for the tests, the impact of the headform never causes the interlayer of V.H.R. glazings to tear at any tempera- ture (Fig. 13). The laceration index is very low-of a mean value ranging between 2 and 3 (Fig. 14). On the other hand, the temperature considerably influenced the tearing of the interlayer (Fig. 14) of conventional glazing, which becomes more cutting as the tear enlarges (Fig. 15). It goes without saying that the laceration index is equal to zero when the inner V.H.R. sheet remains undamaged. When it ruptures, the laceration effect may be very weak but ap- pears even if there is no tearing of the interlayer (Fig. 1 5). When the interlayer tears, the laceration index (as will be seen later in the study of windshield impact) is almost inde- pendent of the length of the cut.

At low temperature and under sudden loading such as at impact, the laminate tends to behave like a monolith. At higher tempera- ture, the layers can slide over one another, which reduces the rigidity modulus of the whole. This change does not occur with the V.H.R. 54 B (horizontal tendency line) partly because the data concerning the glazings with an unbroken inner sheet have been included here. sSiÄ • / ' ' 4 (Init. impact ^ y ♦plow-infonn . y / - • Conventional y .s 400- /-"■ f ■ VHR5AA / ■ X _ A VHR 54 B 300- y m y a VHR 54 B *i«r ~ i ^ (Inner sheet 200 • • ~ i ® unbroken) # -y 100- - ; v - • ~ Impact location 0 I 16 W 20 22 24 26 28 3Õ~ Distance from the »an Fig. 18 - Total severity index versus impact location.

The question of compared levels of peak G and severity in- dex will be dealt with in a following section. It brings in another factor, namely, the location of the impact. This effect, practically equal to 0 for ordinary glass, grows more and more important as the glass is strengthened and as the sheets can, consequently, deform more before breaking. Laceration and Mode of Fragmentation - As it has just been seen, the tensile strength level of the glass clearly but indi- rectly influences the laceration index when the fraction of the initial energy absorbed by the glass is such that tearing does or does not occur in the range of the temperatures used. The same factor has a direct influence on the decrease of the laceration potential since it creates the mode of breakage of the glass. The latter can be characterized by two elements: the size of the fragments (mean value) and the spreading and dis- tribution of the fracture lines in the area covered by the im- pact and the sliding of the head over the inner sheet. The fraction of the impact energy absorbed by the glass is directly proportional to the square of the tensile strength. When rupture occurs, mass energy is freed and transforms itself into a surface fracture energy. Therefore, the fragments are more numerous and tinier as the quantity of the energy absorbed by elastic deformation is greater. This is what happens with V.H.R. glazings (Figs. 22-24), whereas the opposite happens with conventional glazings (Fig. 21). Next to the difference in fragmentation, the photographs of Fig. 25 show the appearance of the fracture lines starting from the impact and rupture point, which, incidentally, are always coinciding. The pattern remains unchanged whether tearing of the interlayer occurs or not. The latter never starts from the impact point but lower, at a variable distance of about 4 or 5 in. In the V.H.R. the fracture radiates in very close lines start- ing from the point of rupture and spreads practically down to the rims of the glazing.

R. PLUMAT, ET AL. In the ordinary laminated glass, the radial lines are few and relatively distant from each other, intersected by nets of circular fractures originating a short distance from the break- ing point and appearing all along the propagation to the edges of the glazing. This can be seen by high-speed movie cameras. While sliding along the glass just after the initial impact, the head and the face come across these nets of circular fractures at a higher speed as the initial impact velocity is higher and the fraction of energy absorbed by the fracturing of the glass smaller. This state of things will increase the number and severity of the cuts, principally on the protruding parts of the face. If we add that the edges of the fragments of the broken strengthened V.H.R. are relatively blunt compared with those of ordinary glass which are very sharp, it is understandable that this double net of fractures helps to increase the lacera- tion potential of the ordinary standard windshield. Laceration , Peak G , and Severity Index - The maximum value of deceleration recorded by the headform during impact is due not only to an effect of inertia between the masses of the missile and the target. This effect is to be seen in the rate of onset which is steeper for thicker ordinary laminated glass, as shown by the oscillograms of Figs. 21-24. Accordingly, the height of the deceleration peak varies with the deformation of the panel before rupture occurs. The elastic line results from the interaction of four factors: 1 . The rigidity to flexion, as defined by the theory of elas- ticity, which is proportional to the cube of the thickness. 2. The location of the impact. 3. The mounting system. 4. The tensile strength of the face of the plate opposite the impact and undergoing a maximum expansion. As it has been seen in Table 2, the mean tensile strength value of the ordinary glass is 14 kg/mm^ and that of V.H.R. X 28 and V.H.R. X 35 (used for the outer ply of V.H.R. 54 A and V.H.R. 54 B glazings) is 28 and 35 kg/mm , respectively. Moreover, if we compare the thicknesses of the ordinary laminated and V.H.R. glazings, taking into account the thick- ness of a fictive mechanically equivalent monolith (80% of the real geometrical thickness after disc tests), we can see that the V.H.R. glazings are more than twice as flexible in bending. Two factors, high tensile strength and low bending rigidity, cause an important elastic deflection which can expend much of 40 mkg impact energy developed by the impact of the 10 kg headform at 20 mph. This explains the higher level of the peak of the V.H.R. glazing and the longer duration of the im- pact during its initial phase. (See Tables 5 and 6B and oscillo- grams in Figs. 21-24.) When peak G is expressed versus impact location (Fig. 16), it is noticeable that it increases as the strain moves away from the rim toward the center of the sample. This evolution occurs with V.H.R. glazing whose deflection is more the diaphragm effect next to the simple effect to bending. The evaluated values of the peak (Table 6B) for the mean value of location of the impact at 23 cm off the rim are 82 g with a standard deviation of 14 for ordinary glass and 106 g with a standard deviation of 16 for V.H.R. 54 A and 54 B, together with those whose inner sheet remains unbroken. Table 4 gives the efficient values of the deceleration over a duration of 1 ms on each side of the peak. These values com- ply with the present data on the tolerance of head impact. Figs. 17 and 18 show that the severity index of the V.H.R. undergoes a greater change than that of peak G with location of the impact point. The value evaluated for initial impact (23 cm off the rim) is 74 (a = 46) for ordinary glazing and 302 (a = 87) for V.H.R. The effect of the plow-in is not important in either of the cases. The interlayer of the laminated windshield does not tear in dependence with the impact point (Fig. 19), whereas the laceration index increases considerably as the impact becomes more central.

Evaluation of the relative level of the biomechanical per- formance of the two variants of V.H.R. glazing and compari- son with conventional ones, primarily to determine the lacera- tive potential. *The windshield used in these tests is a cylindrically curved one manufactured for an American car (A body Chrysler). 2. Evaluation of the influence of the variations of the im- pact velocity on the resistance to penetration, the laceration effects, and the biomechanical values linked with the impact deceleration. 3. Discovery of the effect due to purely mechanical factors, such as the condition of the peripheral sealing, on the shock characteristics. SAMPLES, EXPERIMENTAL DEVICE, AND MEASURING INSTRUMENTS - The means and methods of measurement were identical to those used for the study of the performance of the flat samples, except for the geometry of the supports and their attachment.

Two different systems were used to fix the samples into the body openings. In the first case (Fig. 26), the rim of the curved windshield was clamped in place by two gripping jaws made integral by means of a set of eight bolts similar to the flat samples. The clamping moment of each nut is 2 mkg and the peripheral clamping pressure is about 10 kg/mm^. In the second case (Fig. 27), the curved windshield sticks to the body opening which is fastened on a rigid metallic frame that can be positioned at any angle. Solbit 1 107 from Bostik has been used as a sealant.

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS Influence of the Windshield Installation System - The sta- tistical study reveals that the clamped and bonded windshields behave in an almost identical way, whether they be conven- tional or V.H.R. ones. The peripheral pressures (at least equal to 10 kg/cm ) exerted in the test with clamped windshields gave a similar result to that obtained from windshields sealed with the Bostik tape. The different systems cause but a small peripheral dislodging when impacted at velocities up to 30 mph (impact energy: 90 mkg). Influence of the Mechanical Resistance of Glass in the Per- formances of the V.H.R. Variants at Increasing Impact Veloc- ities - 1. Tables 8 and 9 show a higher frequency of cases where one of the two sheets remains unbroken for variant V.H.R. 54 B, that is, for the more resisting V.H.R. as well as with flat samples. The excessive values of the peak of resultant deceleration, the efficient deceleration during 2 and 3 ms, or the severity index have been obtainable only in tests 14 and 102. These values seem to be excessive for human tolerance. Tests 14 and 102 demonstrate that two sheets remain unbroken at high velocities, that is, high impact energies (63 mkg). The mechanical resistance of the outer ply of variant V.H.R. 54 B must be limited at a lower level than the adopted one (35 kg/mnĄ. A reduction of about 7 kg/mm^ to reach the level of the outer sheet of the V.H.R. 54 A (28 kg/mnĄ would thus be advisable if we consider that the outer sheet of the V.H.R. 54 A systematically breaks at 20 mph. 2. If we compare the cases where both sheets rupture when impacted, we see (a) That the deceleration values and the severity index are always tolerable and only a bit higher for the V.H.R. 54 B than for the V.H.R. 54 A. (b) That the risks of penetration and laceration are almost the same at high velocities (Figs. 31-32). (c) That the rupture of the inner sheet always occurs some milliseconds after the outer sheet has ruptured. Comparison of the Behavior of Conventional and V.H.R. Windshields versus Velocity - Effects of the Velocity on the Laceration Created - Fig. 32 demonstrates that the laceration index increases with the velocity for conventional and V.H.R. windshields; this is due to the fact that the headform scrapes the windshield at a higher velocity. The laceration levels are clearly different for V.H.R. and conventional windshields because of the mode of fragmenta- tion, as explained in the study of flat samples. Figs. 34, 35, 38, and 39 show what generally happens at speeds of 20 and 25 mph, respectively. Figs. 36, 37 and 40 show what happens when at least one of the sheets remains unbroken. Influence of the Velocity on the Deceleration Peak and on the Severity Index - The increase of velocity does not greatly influence the deceleration peak or the severity index of con- ventional windshields.

The severity index, on the other side, is not influenced. The evaluated levels of the deceleration peaks are rated at 1 14 (a = 25) for conventional and at 141 (a = 20) for V.H.R. windshields. The severity index of the initial impact is 144 (a = 88) for conventional and 389 (a = 121) for V.H.R. windshields. The total severity index is 239 (a = 90) against 470 (a = 123). The coefficient of variation is twice as high for conventional windshields. Figs. 34, 35, 38, and 39 show typical examples. CONCLUSIONS This study has enabled us to clarify the influence of the different factors that condition the lacerative injury potential of a laminated windshield. The characteristics of a new type of windshield have been defined to minimize considerably and even to avoid the danger of laceration at high impact energies, while at the same time keeping severity index values below the injury threshold level. The tensile strength of the very thin inner sheet of the wind- shield must be very high. The level and dispersion of the tensile strength of the glass used for the outer ply can be adjusted to limit the impact energy and the severity index to values that have been estab- lished at the beginning. When evaluated on the basis of currently accepted safety parameters and within the confines of the experimental pro- gram considered in this paper, this windshield appears as a consistent approach to the best compromise to meet the safety requirements as well as numerous other demands of a mass- production windshield. More data are needed to assess the new windshield as a part of a passive restraint system. REFERENCES 1 . R. Van Laethem, "A New High Safety Glazing for Auto- mobile and Other Vehicles."
