It is seldom, even in the field of Oriental Numismatics, that one finds a series of coins so untouched as those of the Muwahhid Khalīfehs of Marocco, the Almohades of what may be called the Spanish Crusades. Fraehn, who has generally published all one's discoveries, is in this case completely thrown into the background by Delgado (in Graillard's Monš Esp. Garcia de la Torre Collection) and Castiglioni {Mon. Cuf. dell' I . JR. Mus . di Milano) : but Delgado unfortunately limits himself to the bare registration of inscriptions ; and Castiglioni, on the other hand, admits a superfluous amount of historical com- ment. Adler' s Collectip Nova contains a very good account of four coins of the dynasty. The following is a list of coins now published by me which have been published before : - Dinārs. 'Abd-El-Mu-min, no. 1. (Delgado.) Yûsuf I., no. 3. (Fraehn, Rec. ; Castiglioni, incorrectly; and Delgado.) El-Murtadā, no. 1. (Delgado.) Some of the Dirhems. The rest are, to my knowledge, inedited.

Historical Sketch of the Muwahhids. The name Muwahhid 1 signifies One who says that God is One, a Unitarian. Why El-Mahdī gave the name El- Muwahhidün (vulg. El-Muwahhidin) to his followers has, I believe, never been discussed. And yet it is surely a strange anomaly that a Mohammadan sect should take the name of Unitarians, when it is the fundamental doctrine of El-Islām that there is one God without associate. I think, however, that the name may easily be explained by a reference to the tenets of the sect to which El-Mahdī belonged: this was the Ash'ariyeh, with the opinions of which he was thoroughly imbued.2 He was consequently a vigorous supporter of the allegorical method of interpreting the Kur-ān.3 We find him constantly attacking the over- orthodox Sunnïs4 of El-Maghrib5 on the subject of their anthropomorphic interpretations. In their opposition to anthropomorphism the Ash'arls agreed with the Moatezilïs, and in the section on the latter in Esh-Shahrastanťs Kitãb el-Milel wa-n-Nohal (trans, by Dr. Th. Haarbrücker) we find this sentence:6 'Sie erklären die allegorische Deutung der Korán verse, in welchen solche Y ergleichungen ' [als Richtung, Ort, Gestalt, Körper, u. s. w.] ' vorkommen, für nothwendig, und nennen diese Art und Weise des Ver- fahrens das Einheitsbekenntniss In this word Einheits- w /9 f / ✓ Z' 1 òo~y is the act. participial f noun of , 2nd conj. of . 2 Ibn-Khaldûn, Histoire des Berberes , tr. by De Slane, vol. u. p. 164. 8 Cf.

El-Mahdī, and the rest of the Ash' aris, as well as the Moatezilīs, considered anthropomorphism to be incon- sistent with the belief in the Unity of God ; and therefore the MaghrabI reformers took the name of Unitarians, to distinguish themselves from the old school of El-Maghrib, whom the former regarded as quasi-polytheists.8 Abū- Abel- Allah Mohammad Ibn- Äbd-Alläh-Tümart, the Imām of the Muwahhids, was born in the latter half of the fifth century of the Hijreh. He belonged to the Hergha tribe, a branch of the Masmūda, and, like all Muslim reformers of eminence, was a descendant of 'Alī, the son-in-law of the Prophet. Stimulated by an augury, variously recorded, Mohammad Ibn-Tumart, after travelling in Spain and Egypt, and visiting Mekkeh and Baghdãd, determined to conquer El-Maghrib, then under the rule of the dynasty of Yūsuf Ibn-Tāshifīn, and to secure the sovereignty for the Masmuda. He began by writing several religious treatises, such as the Täivhid. He next instituted systematic polemico-theological discussions with the Maghrabī Doctors, generally coming out victorious. During these religious campaigns he met with 'Abd-El- Mu-min, the future founder of the Muwahhid dynasty. After more wandering, and after presenting himself at Marrākush, at the court of 'All Ibn-Yusuf the Murābit sovereign, Ibn-Tūmart summoned together the tribe of the Masmuda ; and when the chiefs had sworn the oath of fealty to him, he took the name of El-Mahdl ,9 and gave 7 Ed.

Fearing dissensions, 'Abd-Ei-Mu-min and the other chief disciples concealed the death of the Mahdī for about three years under the pretence of illness, and in the meanwhile directed all their efforts towards strengthening and con- solidating the sect. In 524 they announced the death of their master, and also the designation by him of 'Abd- El-Mu-min as successor in the chief authority. The new leader occupied himself with various success- ful expeditions until 534 (1139-40), when he began his seven-years- campaign of conquest. His troops were daily augmented by deserters from the Murābits, and there seemed every prospect of a speedy conquest of El-Maghrib. In 539 (1144-5) he annihilated the army of the Murãbit the religion of El-Islām triumph over all others, and to establish justice throughout the world. 10 This table is taken from De Siane' s Intr. to his Trans, of Ibn-Khaldūn, with very few alterations. Except in a discussion on the meaning of the word, I have thought it advisable to use the relative case Muwahhidln, which in Modern Arabic is em- ployed in the stead of the subjective case Muwahhidun; the use of the latter form being generally deprecated as pedantic.</page><page sequence="6">MUWAHHIDS. 151 Tãshifín Ibn-'Alī, and captured Wahrãn (Oran) and Tilimsãn. In 540 Fãs was taken, and Sebteh (Ceuta) sent a deputation of submission. After seizing Aghmāt and Selā (Salee), 'Abd-El-Mu-min laid siege to Marrākush (Marocco), which, after a seven-months-siege (541), fell, and with it the dynasty of the Murãbits in the person of Ishāk Ibn-'Alī Ibn-Yūsuf Ibn-Tāshifīn. By the cap- ture in 543 of Sijilmāseh" and Miķnāseh (Mequinez) the Muwahhids became masters of the whole of El-Maghrib (Marocco and part of Algiers). In the midst of his African conquests 'Abd-El-Mu-min had not forgotten Spain. An expedition was sent there in 540 (1145-6); and Xeres, Mértola, Niebla, Siloes, Beja, and Badajoz, were speedily added to the dominions of the Unitarians ; Seville was taken in 541 ; and Cordova joined the rest in the following year. Marocco and Spain being subdued, 'Abd-El-Mu-min turned his thoughts towards Afrikiyeh (the country lying between Egypt and Bejãyeh in Algiers) ; and he deter- mined to attack it. In 547 he took Bejãyeh and Ķusan- tlnlyeh (Constantina) ; and, soon after, his son 'Abd-Allāh defeated the Arabs of Afrikiyeh and received their sub- mission, about half the province being thus acquired. Disturbances in other parts of his dominions prevented 'Abd-El-Mu-min from following up this success at once ; but in 553 (1158) he returned to the attack, and suc- ceeded in conquering the more eastern parts of Afrikiyeh, then under the rule of Hoger II. of Sicily : El-Mahdīyeh, Tunis, and Tarãbulus (Tripoli), now formed part of the empire, which stretched from Egypt to the Atlantic and from Marocco to Cordova. 'Abd-El-Mu-min's attention was next directed again towards Spain, where his son Yüsuf was hard pressed by Alfonso YIII. of Castile. After</page><page sequence="7">152 NUMISMATIC CHRONICLE. relieving his son he returned to Africa, and began to make preparations for a renewal of the ' Holy War.' It was when setting out in 558 (1163) for this last expedition that the great leader of the Muwahhids was visited by ' the terminator of delights and the separator of companions/ I have sketched the conquest of the various countries that united to form the extensive empire of the Muwahhids ; and I shall now mention a few of the leading events that happened in the reigns of 'Abd-El-Mu-min's successors. The main subject of interest is the Holy War, or the continual and absorbing struggle between the Christian Kings of Castile and of Aragon and the Mohammadan Khalīfehs of Marrākush for the possession of Andalusia, - a struggle which, long after the subversion of this dynasty, ended in the complete overthrow of the Muslim power in Spain. We have also to notice frequent insurrections in Africa, especially the conquest of Afrïkiyeh attempted, and almost attained, by Ibn-Ghanîyeh. With respect to the orthodoxy of the Khalīfehs, we find a remarkable exception in the case of El-Ma-mūn, who suppressed the name of El-Mahdī in the Khutbeh and Sikkeh, (or prayer and coinage,) and restored the dirhems to their original circular shape : his tolerance extended to allowing the Christians to build a church in Marrākush, and even to ring the bells. Er-Bashīd, the son and successor of this liberal Khalīfeh, seems to have followed in his father's steps; for Adler (Coll. Nov . xc. a.) publishes a silver coin with the name Er-Rashld substituted for El-Mahdī. Pro- bably Es-Sa'Id followed the example of his father and brother. But the coins prove that El-Murtadā and El- Wäthik restored the repudiated name of the Imam of the dynasty to the gold coins ; for we cannot but conclude that El-Ma-mūn omitted the name of El-Mahdī from the gold</page><page sequence="8">MUWAHHIDS. 153 as well as the silver coins, although Ibn-El-Kãtib (ap. Casiri ap. Adler) mentions the omission in the dirhems only. The fall of the Muwahhids was clearly foreshadowed by two significant facts, the multitude of pretenders to the throne, and the growing importance of the tribe of the Benī-Merīn. These mountaineers had long been slowly advancing and gradually increasing in power, until finally, having pursued and killed El-Wāthiķ, they entered Marrākush in 668 (1269-70). On the Coinage of the Muwahhids. The coinage of this dynasty, as represented in the British Museum, exhibits many peculiarities. Gold . Form circular . The area is always square, de- fined by single, double, or triple, lines. The coin is struck of such a size that the circumference almost touches the angles of the inscribed square. Four segments of a circle are thus formed between the square and the circumscribed circle, and in these segments various words which compose the marginal inscription are distributed. In transcribing the coins I have always indicated by spaces the division of the marginal inscription into four parts. The field abounds in points, some diacritical, and some not. When the points are diacritical, intentionally or accidentally, I have noted them separately. Instances will be observed of diacritical points inverted, put above instead of below a letter, or contrariwise. There are usually three dots in each of the four segments, one at each end and one in the middle, independent of the diacritical points. The appropriation of a particular area or margin to a particular part of the in- scriptions is also noteworthy. The area of the obverse is always reserved for religious sentences, including the pro- fession of faith J ¿Is-* Sļ aJU), and generally a reference to the Mahdī, and the special motto of the</page><page sequence="9">154 NUMISMATIC CHRONICLE. Muwahhids *2 adopted for official purposes by Yüsuf I. in 561. The area of the reverse is always appropriated to the name and titles of 'Ábd-El-Mu-min, with sometimes a clause on the MahdL The margin of the reverse is occupied by the name of the reigning Khalīfeh, and that of the obverse by the name of his predecessor, (or a sentence from the Ķur-ān,) save in the cases of El-Murtadā and El-Wathiķ, who reversed this by putting their own names on the obverse margin and that of Yüsuf on the reverse margin.

The supposition, maintained by some writers, that this name must be referred to the 'Abbāsī Khallfeh El-Ķāīm is scarcely countenanced by the facts that the Muwahhids and the Abbāsls were the representatives of hostile sects, the former being Shī'īs and the latter Sunnïs ; and also that El-Ķāīm had been dead half-a-century when 'Abd-El-Mu-min was circulating his coinage. I think there is not the least doubt that this name was a title of 'Abd-El-Mu-min : for, except on his own coins, it always, throughout the series of dinārs of this dynasty, precedes his name ; and even on his own coins the case is the same, if we suppose the marginal inscription to be a continuation of that in the area.

M. to his grandfather Yusuf I. : this would create an anomaly ; for both the preceding and the following Khalîfeh put his own name on II. M. This anomaly is done away with if we suppose the coin to have been struck by Yûsuf II., II. M. thus referring to himself and I. M. to his father En-Nāsir. The fact, however, that Yûsuf is called 'son of the Khalîfeh ' seems to point in the other direction; for is the title of 'Abd El-Mu-min alone.</page><page sequence="17">162 NUMISMATIC CHRONICLE.

There can be no reasonable doubt that these square coins were issued by one or more of the Sovereigns of the Muwahhids. The following passage from Ibn Khaldūn13 is interesting in its bearing on the square form of the coins. 'L'Imam, ayant quitté les Hintata, se dirigea vers Aîguîlîn, dans le pays des Hergha, et s'arrêta au milieu de sa tribu. Il y arriva l'an 515 (1121-2). Ayant alors bâti un rabta pour s'y livrer à la dévotion, il attira auprès de lui une foule d'étudiants et de gens de différentes tribus, auquels il enseigna son Morchida et son Tauhid , rédigés en langue berbère. Le nombre de ses partisans s'accrut tellement que Malek-Ibn- Woheib, président du corps des savants qui assistaient aux réunions de l'émir Ali-Ibn- Youçof, recommença ses dénonciations. Jouissant d'une certaine réputation comme augure et astrologue, il ne manqua pas d'indisposer son patron contre le Mehdi, et, comme les devins avaient prédit qu'un roi de race berbère devait nécessairement paraître en Maghreb et changer la forme de la monnaie aussitôt qu'il y aurait une conjunction des deux planètes supérieures, ce prince s'attendait déjà à quelques malheurs. " Protège l'empire contre cet aven- turier, lui disait Ibn- Woheib; c'est assurément l'homme de la conjonction et du dirhem carré ; celui dont il est question dans ces méchants vers en patois qui courent maintenant de bouche en bouche.

' I am completely at a loss to decide to what prince of the dynasty these square coins should be assigned. At first I inclined to the opinion that they were struck by El-Mahdl himself. But my attention was directed by Sen. Camarino to the fact that the mint-places whose names are found on the coins were not conquered by the Muwahhids till after the death of El-Mahdl. Sen. Cama- rino's opinion is that the coins were struck by the whole series of Muwahhid Khalïfehs. I think this view highly probable, and the slight differences of these coins inter se by dots and fleurons favours it. Still, as all the mint- places found on the square Muwahhid dirhems in the British Museum Collection were conquered in the time of 'Abd El-Mu-min, it is quite possible that all of them were struck by him or in his time. The passage I have quoted from Ibn-Khaldūn would make one think that some of the dirhems were struck by 'Abd-El-Mu-min himself in order to fulfil the prediction ; but on the other hand Adler (Coll. Nov . lxxxix. a.) publishes a square dirhem with these inscriptions : I. ¿ - ! - S ' . 1 *-11 II.</page><page sequence="23">168 NUMISMATIC CHRONICLE. If this coin was really issued by 'Abd-El-Mu-min (and the fact that the inscriptions, put together, are identical with M. II. of the dinārs of this Khalifeh (see p. 154), puts this, in my opinion, beyond a doubt) it is difficult to conceive why he should have issued a different type of coin on which his name is not mentioned. Adler has also published (ibid. xc. a.) a circular dirhem of Er-Rasheed, tenth of the line ; the circular form is explained by the orthodoxy of El-Ma-mūn (see p. 152). There still remain, however, several important Khalï- fehs whose names we find on no dirhems. These dubious dirhems may have been struck by them. I must now leave the square coins, with their origin as much in obscurity at the end of my remarks as at the beginning, except for these few negative results. (1) It is impossible that those of them that have mints should have been struck by El-MahdI. (2) From the first fact, and also (as Adler remarks) from the early death of El-Mahdī, it is very un- likely that he struck even the unminted dirhems. (3) It is impossible that they should have been struck by El-Ma-mūn or Er-Kashīd. (4) 'Abd-El-Mu-min having struck dirhems with his own name on them, it is improbable that he struck others without his name. Stanley E. Lane Poole.

In looking over the coins of the Saffārls in the British Museum, I found on one of them a new mint, which I O 9 subsequently discovered to be Bust. I think this is worth publishing, and have therefore added it as an appendix to my paper on the Muwahhids, not thinking it necessary to make a separate article on so short a subject.

Bust was a city between Sijistān, Ghazneh, and Herāt : it now exists, but in ruins.14 I believe this mint is as yet unknown, and my opinion is confirmed by that of Señ. Camarino, whose wide acquaintance with Oriental Numis- matics gives it great weight. El-Leyth Ihn- Ali must have been a son of 'All the brother of Yaakub and 'Omar the sons of Leyth : and the date exactly agrees with the hypothesis.15 Stanley E. Lane Poole.
