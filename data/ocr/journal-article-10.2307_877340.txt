(Phaidon), ?6. Though many of Stubbs's works have long since lost their subtleties through injudi- cious restoration, the quality of Stubbs as a painter, as a virtuoso technician and the most fastidious of craftsmen, is general- ly recognised: the detail in his pictures, whether it be the sheen of a horse's coat, the trappings of some elegant carriage or the movements of a stable-lad as he goes about his business, is often breathtaking. As to the fullness of his merit as an artist, or his place in ths history of art, especially late eighteenth-century British art, it has not been so easy to make up one's mind, though the exhibitions devoted to, or including, his work held in London in 256</page><page sequence="2">THE LITERATURE OF ART the last fifteen years have helped consider- ably. Now we have two books on Stubbs, one a straightforward account of his life and career, such as we know it, containing a sensitive appreciation of his work and qualities as an artist, the other a more probing essay posing a greater variety of questions and distilled from the researches of over twenty-five years, the prelude to a greater work to come. Very little is known about Stubbs upon which to base a biography, and though Constance-Anne Parker's book is broadly chronological in arrangement, most of the chapters are sensibly devoted to significant aspects of his work, the Ana- tomy of the Horse, the mares and foals series, the lion and horse series, the experiments in enamel painting, the Turf Gallery, the Comparative Anatomy. Miss Parker writes with knowledge and sensi- tivity about Stubbs's technical processes, and with insight about his artistic inten- tions. She notes that he painted relatively few hunting scenes, which would appear surprising on the face of it, but puts her finger on the reason when she acknow- ledges his greatest gift as the ability to produce 'a stillness that is not frozen'. Stubbs penetrated more deeply into the nature of living organisms than any artist since Leonardo, but he was also a com- poser with the sense of poise and balance of a Raphael or a Poussin. He was far less interested in movement and drama - there is in fact very little narrative in his work - than in some sort of univers'al harmony, and pictorial statements which might be held valid for all time. 'He never reproduces mere surface forms, but, like a sculptor, he re-creates the solid whole, with the basic, underlying forms affecting the superficial shapes. The tensions and stresses of ligament and muscle over bone are as structurally balanced and as beauti- fully articulated as a modern mobile. The interrelationship of the various parts in space are allied to architecture and sculpture in their approach.' The analo- gies are apt. The volume is well and amply illus- trated, though most of the colour plates are on the warm side, and the mares and foals and lion and horse compositions are reproduced as a series on single pages, as well as separately, so that Stubbs's permutations on these themes can be properly studied. Criticisms might be made on the production side: it would have been useful to supply dates for the paint- ings illustrated, and insufficient thought seems to have been given to the index. But these are small matters. Stubbs emerges from Miss Parker's account not only as the determined and ruggedly independent figure, endowed with an iron constitution, we might well expect from the stories of his labours at Horkstow or of the nine miles he walked the day before he died, but as a conscien- tious person in all his dealings, intimately concerned, for instance, with the adminis- trative affairs of the Society of Artists, of which he was Treasurer for four years. The man is seen more in the round than hitherto, but it is not within the scope of her book to place him in the artistic context of his time, or in relation to the whole development of animal painting in Britain, a fascinating and revealing subject in itself. For a more broadly art-historical view we must turn to Basil Taylor, to whose studies, by the way, Miss Parker modestly acknowledges her debt. Mr Taylor is quite clear about the place of Stubbs in British art from the moment of his d6but in London, and makes the challenging statement that he was 'the most versatile and exploratory painter' of the I76o's, a decade which was in any case one of the most fertile and experi- mental in the whole history of British painting. When one adds up what Stubbs did achieve in these years, the most productive probably of his whole career, one is bound to admit that, even in the age which witnessed the full maturity of Gainsborough, Reynolds, Wilson and Wright, Stubbs was exactly what Mr Tay- lor claims. Why then, and with the patronage he had, did his career fizzle out? Mr Taylor argues that it was his very independence of outlook which explained both his initial success and his ultimate failure, from a worldly point of view. Whereas his magnificent portraits of Gimcrack or Whistlejacket far outdistanced Wootton, and rid horse painting of the clutter of baroque accessories, the essential restraint and detachment of his style gradually made less appeal in the decades before I8oo, when animal painting was required to be dramatic and powerfully emotive, later, even anthropomorphic. Comparisons of pictures by Stubbs with Wootton on the one hand and Ward, Northcote and Delacroix on the other, make the point clear. Similarly, his rustic scenes, produced when the overt senti- ment of Wheatley or of Gainsborough's Cottage Door compositions was what the public required, exhibit a control, tran- quillity and solemn monumentality out of key with the temper of the age. Balance, detachment, tranquillity, monumentality: these are the terms one most often applies to Stubbs. It is not surprising, therefore, that he should have devoted so much time and effort to the perfection of a process of painting on ceramic tablets, a process which, as Mr Taylor observes, would give his work the durability of sculpture. The apparent eccentricities of a great artist are usually explicable in artistic terms. Stubbs was painting for eternity. Mr Taylor also discusses Stubbs's portraiture, his history painting, the lion and horse subjects, his pictorial geometry, and his landscape backgrounds, which he varied from shadows of Smith of Chichester to the sublime or the romantic, according to need. The illustrations are uniformly excellent, and, though it is a pity that some have had to be split down the middle in order to achieve a double spread, one appreciates the necessity of this editorial decision. What, however, of the coloured paper used for the text? One wonders whether Stubbs, whose taste in frames for his pictures, for example, was plainness, would quite have approved. Otherwise, the production is as impeccable as Mr Taylor's text. JOHN HAYES</page></plain_text>
