<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EXCAVATIONS AND SURVEYS Sepphoris, 1996* Excavations at Sepphoris, by the University of South Florida, opened on 10 June 1996. The excavations were directed by J.E Strange, with T.R.W. Longstaff and D.E. Groh as associate directors. Area supervisors were: A. Fischer, T. Gilbertson, G. Kalantzis, H. Murphy, B. Pilcher, J. Serrage, L. Sorkin, J.C. Strange and J.R. Strange. The staff also included: L. Roussin (mosaicist), J. Keller (glass historian), A. Fischer (glass technologist), R. Kremer (architect), A. Fradkin (zooarchaeologist), D. Treacy-Cole (numismatist), R. Levy (surveyor), M.L. Jones (registrar) and C. Strange (camp manager). The Excavations The objectives of this season were: 1) to further disclose the stratigraphie history of the Field V building, hitherto called the 'Peristyle Building' and now designated as the basilical building; and 2) to correlate the stratigraphy from the east and west areas in this building. Our hypothesis was that the basilical building is one structure, 40x60 m., founded in the Early Roman period, probably by Herod Antipas, and continuing in use until its destruction in the middle of the fourth century CE. At the east end of the building a bath was built in the Byzantine period, deeply disturbing the basilical building and obscuring its history and disposition in earlier periods. Red soil was found everywhere under the polychrome mosaic where the deposition could be checked, particularly in Square Vil. A very small fraction of the mosaic was found, probably from the side room in Square VIO. The foundation for the stylobate continued from the north-west in Square Vil. A wall (60 cm. thick) was discovered, the outside wall of a stepped pool in Square V25. This pool measured at least 1.10 m. from east to west; its dimension from north to south has yet to be determined. 300 100 SEPPHORIS 200 BETHSAIDA TEL REKHESH SHA'AR HA-GOLAN h 50 0 20 40 h 000 km. * Cf.

A drain ran from north-east to south-west beneath the mosaic at its destroyed eastern edge. Another drain connected with the one found to the south in previous seasons. An unexpected find was the remains of a stepped pool entered from the north, which lay beneath the level of the coloured mosaic of the side aisle. This pool and a short section of wall (L46017) beneath the mosaic hint at the occupation before the founding of the basilical structure. The polychrome mosaic with its full borders was found again, as predicted, in Square VI15. The pattern connected up with the mosaic excavated in previous seasons to the south-west. The bedding of the mosaic was excavated where the pavement had been damaged in antiquity. One of the building's internal walls, identical to the fa?ade, was found some 25.3 m. to the west of the latter. This wall appeared in Square VI11. From the thickness of the wall (52 cm.) and the depositions on both sides, it was determined that the basilical structure measured c. 40x34.7 m. At the eastern end of the building four colonnaded porches stood around a central, unroofed courtyard. Those who entered the building (length: c. 60 m.) from the cardo entered the first porch. All traces of the porches of the basilical structure were disturbed by later occupation in Square VI08. In the sixth century CE. there was substantial glass pyrotechnology in this area, which extended at least 5 m. to the north and to the east. A collapsed glass furnace was found in the south-western corner of Square VI08, with the debris of the furnace extending into V25 and V107. The furnace was built of wattle and daub in a beehive shape. Beneath the level of the furnace there was an earlier Byzantine room (only 0.74 0.60 m.), presumably for storage, although it was found empty. A probe to bedrock in VI12 found little architecture, but the stratigraphie history extended from the Early Roman to the Late Arab period. This area would have lain under the western porch against the closing wall of the basilical building. A foundation, running from south-west to north-east, appeared in Square VI09; we tentatively interpret it as one of the porch stylobates. If this is correct, it would mean that the porch is 3.0 m. wide. Drains emptied water from beneath the porch at the east end of the probe. A heavy Late Roman paving was found, used as the pavement of the unroofed courtyard inside the four porches on the west of the basilical building. It is clearest in Square VI13. The pavement was at the same elevation (261.51) as the mosaic floor to the west and abutted against it. That is, the pavement was reused in the fifth century to form part of the courtyard of the Byzantine bath, which succeeded the basilical building and its porch after the destruction of both in the mid-fourth century C.E. The major occupation in Square VI14 ranged from the sixth to the tenth century CE. A series of hard floors was found, apparently part of the area devoted to the glass industry in these centuries. A bell shaped void was excavated, slightly over 1 m. deep, but equipped with a square, pierced stone top (c. 40x40 cm.). The top resembles that of a cistern, albeit much smaller. There was nothing recoverable in the soil that washed inside. The central hole in the top stone is only 22 cm. wide. It is possible that this served as a privy for the glass workers in the area.

Longstaff</page><page sequence="3">124 NOTES AND NEWS Sepphoris, 1997* Another season of excavations was carried out at ancient Sepphoris between 8-23 May 1997, on behalf of the University of South Florida, Illinois Wesleyan University, Colby College and Centre College. The excavations were directed by J.F. Strange (University of South Florida), with D.E. Groh (Illinois Wesleyan University) as associate director and C.T. McCollough as assistant director and field archaeologist. Area supervisors were: W. Folds, M. Keith, G. Lindstrom, D. Patterson, B. Pilcher and J.R. Strange. Other staff members included: R. Levy (surveyor), M.L. Jones (registrar), C. Strange (camp manager), E McKenna Jr. (architect's assistant), K. Galbreath (photographer) and W. McGee (tools). Students from Illinois Wesleyan University formed the majority of the volunteers. The Excavations Six squares were opened, three at the architectural change from basilica to porch, and three in the bath complex in the east (Fig. 1). The hypothesis was that the chronology of the exterior walls of the basilical building's porches. It was also hoped that the stratigraphie record recovered in these structures would help clarify the sixth-thirteenth century CE. occupation of the building. The three new squares (VI14, VI16 and VI17) that were opened adjacent to the large mosaic panel covering the basilical building's central floor were intended to test the hypothesis that the basilical structure ended some 40 m. east of the western wall. If this hypothesis were correct, the architecture east of this point would consist of porches, such as those recovered in front of churches, but without a narthex, which is characteristic of a church and not of a secular basilica. Excavations in these three squares recovered a spectrum of occupational evidence, stretching from the late Hellenistic or Early Roman to the Late Arab periods. They also revealed critical architectural elements of the basilical building, contributing to our understanding of the structure's plan. Just east of the central, geometric mosaic panel, a patch of mosaic floor and its -__-1 f 258.845 i i_ Fig 1. USF excavations at Sepphoris, 1997: plan. three new squares opened in the east would complete our understanding of the history of the bath complex and fill in the * Cf. above. rudus were found. A drain, uncovered to the south of this patch, had been sealed by the rudus, suggesting that the mosaic floor was part of the late Roman renovation of the building (late third or early fourth century CE.). In the course of this renovation the</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND NEWS 125 earlier drain had been sealed up and had become part of the Late Roman mosaic foundation. Any evidence of the stylobate to the east of the mosaic and its rudus in Square V.114 was removed by extensive Late Roman robbing. Further east of this mosaic, excavations exposed a wall running south-west to north east, the continuation of the wall exposed in the 1996 season. The upper course of the present wall is constructed from stones reused in the Byzantine period or later, while the lower courses and foundation date from the Early Roman period. This Early Roman wall was founded upon a finely constructed, pre-existing wall, perhaps of the Early Hellenistic or even the Persian period. Early Roman disturbance to bedrock has disrupted the stratigraphie history of this earlier wall. The stratigraphy and building sequence of this wall tends to confirm our hypothesis that it served as an eastern external wall to the building, separating it from the porch, which extended c. 22.5 m. to the cardo. The continuation of the paved courtyard found in previous seasons emerged east of the external wall of the basilica. The pavement in its last use dated from the Arab II period (tenth century C.E.). Beneath these layers were remains of the Early Roman building, including the foundation of the porch, projected from previous seasons to the south-east. West of the foundation there was a make-up for the Early Roman porch. Overlying the Early Roman elements in the north-western corner of Square VI17 there was a 60 cm. layer of ash from the Byzantine II to Arab II periods. There were localised modern intrusions into this ash layer, probably from agricultural activities in the area. The last feature in and above this ash layer was a semi-circular stone structure, with a low adjacent pavement of stones (constructed in part from basalt grinders), forming a surface in association with it. The Byzantine bath appeared in the squares excavated next to the cardo. Next to the Byzantine street the upper portion of a wall for an interior pool was found. This wall, constructed in the Byzantine I period, enclosed a pool (8 3.6 m.; over 3 m. deep). North of this pool, large stones, presumably taken from the north wall of the Early Roman porch, were found reused as paving stones for the Byzantine street. Beneath them, a well-cut stone was exposed (elevation: 259.695); it may belong to the Early Roman outer wall of the basilical building's porch. South of the Byzantine street, the interior space is defined on the west by two stones (elevation: 260.239), part of a wall running south-west to north-east. The stones are worn and battered on their top edges in their Byzantine reuse, but seem to be in their Early Roman position. In their Byzantine context, they appear to be defining a small room connected to the bath. A drain running parallel to this wall and immediately to its west was connected with the bath and was used for the hypocaust, which had been exposed in the area immediately to the west in previous seasons. A rectangular platform of stones ? partially covered with mortar (elevation: 260.130) ? stood parallel to and against the wall, and may be the foundation of a bench. Excavations next to the cardo recovered a pool (depth: nearly 3 m.), with a set of steps descending into it from north-east to south-west, beginning at a point 25 cm. from the south-east corner. The stratigraphy and pottery indicate that the bath and pool were no longer in use by the time of the Arab II period (eleventh century C.E.). There was evidence of Arab II robbing of portions of the pool's west exterior wall in the north-west of the excavated area.</page><page sequence="5">126 notes and news The eastern wall of the bath was built against large, well-cut stones that may have been robbed from the outer wall of the basilical building's porch. These stones were used to pave part of the north-south street ? the cardo ? in the early Byzantine period. The soil excavated further east of these stones exposed a series of compact, crushed limestone and plaster surfaces that served as the continuation of the paved cardo, and replaced the Roman paving stones robbed in the Byzantine II period. Evidence of the existence of a road before the Roman paving stones was uncovered in previous seasons by sectioning the soil beneath the second-century pavers (see D. Edwards and CT. McCollough: The Roman Road at Sepphoris, eidem [eds.], Archaeology and the Galilee. Texts and Contexts in the Graeco-Roman and Byzantine Periods, Atlanta, GA, 1997, pp. 112-126). James F. Strange, Dennis E. Groh and c thomas mccollough Sepphoris, 1998* A further season of excavation took place between 5 May and 14 July 1998, on behalf of the University of South Florida, directed by J.F. Strange, with D.E. Groh (Illinois Wesleyan University) and T.R.W. Longstaff (Colby College) as associate directors. Prof. Longstaff also served as excavation photographer. CT. McCollough (Centre College) was assistant director and field archaeologist. Area supervisors were: M. Dickens (Charlottesville, VA); H. Erickson (University of Arizona); C. Groh (Northwestern University); E. Mangie (University of South Florida); B. Pilcher (Tampa, FL); J. Regnvall (University of * Cf. above. South Florida); S. Sammons (University of South Florida); and R. Wolfe (Colby College). Other staff members were: D. Treacy-Cole (Bristol University, Bristol, UK) as numismatist; A. Fradkin (Florida International University) as zooarchae ologist; M.L. Jones (Houston, TX) as registrar; J. Keller (Safety Harbor, FL) as glass historian and glass registrar; R. Levy (Tampa, FL) as surveyor; and C Strange (Tampa, FL) as administrator. The Excavations Excavations within the building just west of the fa?ade wall of Square V47 (Fig. 1) revealed destruction debris containing painted plaster fragments directly under the modern surface and on top of a fourth-century CE. white mosaic floor. A surprise was a cross wall ? founded in the Early Roman period ? discovered east of this floor and scarcely one metre west of and parallel to the fa?ade. The cross wall's northern end abutted against the back of a pool excavated in previous seasons. Excavations across the eastern, closing wall of the basilical space in Square V116 revealed evidence of a post-destruction hypocaust brick-making industry (Byzantine I and II) amid a 60 cm. layer of black ash. The ash lay upon a plastered floor and a bench, which was 70 cm. wide and was built up against the east fa?ade of the building. Under the floor of the north-eastern corner of the basilica space lay a cistern (Square V78), probably of the first century CE. From this cistern the water was conducted off the roof, generally to the city sewers in the south-east. This particular cistern opened into a second one to the north-west. Square V.78 disclosed the continuation of the fa?ade wall northward, as did Square V38. In Squares V38, V63 and V118, east of the fa?ade, excavations revealed evidence</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND NEWS 127 Fig 1. USF excavations at Sepphoris, 1998: plan. of several massive destructions of the Byzantine and Arab I baths. A gold dinar of Abd al-Malik (685-705 CE.) found, together with Umayyad pottery, in the ash in Square V.118 suggests that this destruction was the terminus of the Arab use of the bath. The destruction debris was very rich in artefactual material, such as glass, pottery and bronze fragments. The excavations across the wall south of the north street in Square V.118 revealed more of the Byzantine hypocaust excavated in previous seasons, which accounts for some of the ash. Excavations inside the bath to the south of the street showed that the Early Roman constructions had been badly pillaged by Byzantine builders of the bath. Nevertheless, it was evident that there had been an Early Roman pool in Square V63, built on bedrock against the north wall of the complex. The north wall disclosed in Square VI18 was founded in the Early Roman period. In Square V38, between the pool in Square V.63 and the cistern in Square V78, there are rectangular cuttings in the bedrock with terra rosa and scraps of Herodian pottery, possibly suggesting a pre-Herod Antipas presence. On the last day of excavations, fragments of a Roman iron cuirass, perhaps of the type known as Lorica Segmentata, began to emerge in the terra rosa with the pottery of the first century B.C.E. and the first century C.E. The iron cuirass was in very poor condition, but may have been deposited intact. Excavations in Squares V64 and V70, near the intersection of the cardo and the east-west street that marked the north side of the building, revealed remnants of the Byzantine bath and street of the fifth and sixth centuries C.E. The two northern corners of the deep pool, excavated in previous years, also emerged. The west side of the deep pool in Square V.64 proved to have been constructed on the remains of first-century C.E. walls. The westernmost wall in this square still stood five courses high, abutting and forming a corner with a similarly constructed wall to the south. The cornering wall was cut by a later Early Roman wall, that had been dismantled in antiquity, but whose foundation was used as that of the deep Byzantine pool.</page><page sequence="7">128 NOTES AND NEWS While our knowledge of the history of the bath has been expanded, the relation of the bath to the ruined basilical building remains unclear, and this complex history will be the object of further research. James F. Strange, Dennis E. Groh, Thomas R.W Longstaff and C. Thomas Mccollough Bethsaida 1996-1998* The twelfth season of excavations at Bethsaida took place from May to July 1998. The excavations were carried out on behalf of the Consortium for the Bethsaida Excavations Project, headed by the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). R. Arav was director of the excavations; R. Freund (UNO) was project director and corresponding secretary; S. Fortner (University of Munich, Germany) was assistant to the director. Also participated: F.

The Excavations The 1997 and 1998 seasons were devoted mainly to the exploration of the gate area in Area A. The description below includes the 1996 finds as well. The city gate is situated at the eastern side of the city on top of the upper part of the mound. The gate was destroyed in a fierce conflagration which left a huge heap of dirt and ruins, above which the later levels were constructed. The order of description is from the lower to upper layers. Area A Level 6: The Iron Age IIa (Tenth to Early Ninth Century B.C.E.) The earliest fortifications were laid and the layout of the city was established in this level. The founders designated the eastern section of the city, located above a short and deep ravine, to serve as the city gate. For this purpose, an elevated rampart was erected on the spur of the ravine, supported by a revetment wall. A massive tower at the rampart was excavated in 1994 in Square M 43: it measures 8x10 m. and was constructed with very large boulders. During the 1998 season, exterior segments of the city wall were unearthed in Square L 58 (Fig. 1). No more than a few courses of the city wall were preserved in this area. The inner part of the wall, excavated in 1994, is better preserved. These excavations revealed a massive revetment wall at 90? to the north-south city wall, running from east to west (Squares K-J 58). About 3 m. from the city wall it turns south, parallel to the city wall, and runs approximately another 5 m. to a corner, where it turns west again. This is * Cf.

At the eastern fa?ade of the city wall (Squares M-L 58), a paved plaza was discovered, inclining slightly toward the east. A layer of plaster was found at the northern section of the pavement. Level 6, with its retaining tower, was destroyed by an immense conflagration, which filled the entire area with debris and fallen bricks. The city gate of this level presumably lies under the remains of the gate in Level 5. Level 5: The Iron Age IIb (Ninth Century to 732 B.C.E.) (Figs. 1, 2) The city wall from the previous period was renovated and reused during this period. The 1994 excavations showed that its inner face was reinforced with a new wall (1.4 m. wide). The revetment wall and tower of the earlier period went out of use and were buried under a thick layer of debris. The surface was levelled and prepared for the new structure in Squares I-J 58-59, which was built with large boulders and thick walls. One large hall of this building has been excavated so far (7x7.5 m.); it is divided into two long chambers by a partition wall, both ends of which were made for passage, but whose entries were blocked in a later phase. The main entrance to this hall was from its north-west corner. Another entrance led into the hall from the north, the back of the city gate. The City Gate (Squares N-J 51-57) The city gate was built with massive boulders, weighing a few hundred kilograms. Its large size (17.5x30.6 m.), huge chambers and unusual state of preservation (up to 3 m.) are unparalleled in the architecture of the Land of Israel during the Iron Age. The gate consists of four chambers; two towers flank the Fig. 2. Bethsaida, Area A: aerial view of gate area.</page><page sequence="10">NOTES AND NEWS 131 entryway. Horizontal depressions, up to 25 cm. in width and 1.5 m. above the ground, cross most of the walls, indicating that wooden beams were interwoven in the construction of the gate. The wooden beams provided flexibility to the structure in times of earthquakes, still common to this region. Remains of thick white plaster on top of red plaster were found almost everywhere in the gate, indicating that when the gate had been in use the prevailing colour was white, this plaster hiding the black basalt stones and the reddish-yellowish mudbricks which constituted the second and perhaps the third floor. A large well-paved plaza, found in front of the gate, has been excavated thus far to an extent of 20 m. and was preserved at its widest point to a width of 9.5 m. The plaza slopes slightly up toward the threshold of the gate. In Square M 58, the pavement ends abruptly in an east-west line; south of this point there is debris of large boulders. The gate plaza is 1 m. higher than the pavement found in front of the city wall in Squares L-M 58. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the southern plaza is earlier than the northern one. The towers and the threshold. Each tower measures 6 m. in length and 10 m. in width. There are no remains of any rooms in the towers, which were filled with large and medium-sized stones. A low stone bench, running along the fa?ade of the northern tower, measures 2.5 m. in length and 0.6 m. in width. The area north of the tower was reinforced by a thick wall when in use. Two deep niches (2.65x2.65 m.) were made at the two towers. The northern niche contained a high place; the southern one held a high shelf (for the gate's ritual functions, see below). A well-dressed and constructed threshold was discovered 1.5 m. away from the niches' corners. Particularly interesting is the stop stone at the centre of the threshold: it is a semicircular dressed stone. Traces marking the location of the doors are still clearly visible. The area where one would expect the door's pivot was totally destroyed. Next to this place we found a cluster of fallen bricks hardened by fire. Remains of white plaster covering red plaster were found on the entrance walls. Near the stop stone there were remains of carbonated wood, most probably deriving from the wooden doors. The entrance hall. The threshold is located 30 cm. above the pavement of the passageway, which is perhaps to be identified with the Biblical term 'the Entrance Hall' (Ezek. 40:8-9). This passageway had been meticulously paved, although most of the stones were worn away by use. Four large chambers were built in the gate. Chamber 1 was excavated in 1998. The only finds in this chamber are a few ceramic and basalt vessels. An elevated threshold leads to the chamber (10.7 3.65 m.), the southern end of which was destroyed by a modern Syrian military trench and a few earlier Bedouin tombs. The walls between the chambers and the western walls of the gate were an even width of 2.5 m. Chamber 2 is similar in size to Chamber 1. So far, only the southern portion of the chamber has been excavated. It contained aim. thick layer of ash; large pieces of carbonated wood, most likely from the ceiling, were discovered in it. Chamber 3 was partially excavated during this and previous seasons. Aim. thick layer of barley grain occupied the entire chamber ? reaching a weight of one ton ? suggesting that at least in its very final stage, the chamber functioned as a granary.</page><page sequence="11">132 NOTES AND NEWS Chamber 4 was excavated in 1997; it contained layers of ash, a large number of pottery sherds and vessels, including incense burners and 15 iron arrow heads, as well as a small quantity of carbonated grain (Fig. 3). Remains of fired plaster were found on the walls. The high place (Fig. 4). A high place was found at the northern niche of the tower. Like the gate, the high place was built with basalt stones in very fine and meticulously crafted masonry. Remains of plaster on the walls and the steps of the high place indicate that like the gate, this structure had been covered in white plaster, hiding its basalt core. The high place measures 2.1 m. in length and 1.53 m. in width. Two steps (length: 20 cm.; height: 20 cm.) lead to a square podium (1.53x1.53 cm.) at the top. At its highest point, the high place is 80 cm. above the pavement. On the podium there is a basalt rectangular basin (69x50 cm.; height: 35 cm.), with a depression (53x35 cm., depth: 10 cm.). Near one of the corners there is a shallow cavity. Since the basin was covered by a decorated stele and was sealed from later intrusions since the time Fig. 3. Bethsaida, Area A, Level 5: Chamber 4 of gate.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES AND NEWS 133 Fig. 4. Bethsaida, Area A, Level 5: high place. of its destruction, the finds in the basin are significant for dating the destruction of the high place and the gate. Two perforated three-legged cups ? 'incense burners' ? were found in the basin; they date from the second half of the eighth century B.C.E. The stelae. Five large stelae, one decorated, have been found so far at Bethsaida. Three of the non-decorated stelae were found installed in the pavement in the fa?ade of the city gate; one was found at the inner end of the gate, leaning against its corner. The easternmost was found 3.5 m. in front of the northern tower in Square 53 (Fig. 1). Its top had been removed and its lower part was embedded in the courtyard pavement. The stele, now 92 cm. high, originally stood to a height of 1.2 m., like the other stelae. It is 42 cm. wide and 20 cm. thick, and is carved from fairly dense basalt stone. Two other non-decorated stelae were found flanking the entrance on either side, aligned with the passageway (see Fig. 1), thus not impeding the movement of street goers. The tops of the two stelae were</page><page sequence="13">134 NOTES AND NEWS removed in antiquity, presumably deliberately. One top was found at the foot of the stele; the other was in secondary use in the Syrian military trench. The basalt stone selected for these two stelae is not as dense as that of the eastern one. The two stelae have similar dimensions: the northernmost, in Square M 54, is 124 cm. in height, 52 cm. wide and 20 cm. thick; the southernmost is 120 cm. in height, 52 cm. wide, and 20 cm. thick. The decorated stele (Fig. 5) was found smashed into five pieces, with the top of the stele laid upside-down at the bottom of the stairs, probably intentionally. These fragments were made of lower-density basalt stone; the carving was executed Fig. 5. Bethsaida, Area A, Level 5: decorated stele. roughly, but deep enough to convey the details clearly. Undoubtedly, the stele was placed between the wall of the niche and the basin. In order to smash it, the destroyers pushed it off the top of the high place. The stele (height: 115 cm.; width: 59 cm.; thickness: 31 cm.) depicts a stylised figure with concave limbs, equipped with a dagger. A strip down the middle of the figure's body connects it to the dressed frame of the stele. A bull's head is placed on the top of the figure. Large horns, possibly referring to the moon crescent, adorn the head. Four projections are visible next to the figure's chest. This presentation is interpreted as the moon god in an Aramaean manifestation (see M. Bernett and 0. Keel: Mond, Stier und Kult am Stadttor. Die Stele von Betsaida [et-Tell] Unter Mitarbeit von Stefan M?nger [Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 161], Schweiz ? G?ttingen, 1998). The fifth stele was found inside the city in Square J 54. This stele was not installed inside the pavement, but was found leaning against the wall. In coming seasons we will attempt to determine the original place of this stele and the reason for its placement there. This stele differs from the others: it is made of non-vesicular basalt stone, and is narrower and less dressed. It has an obelisk form, 10 cm. thick at the upper part and 30 cm. at the bottom, and is 112 cm. high and 33 cm. wide. The shelf in the southern niche. As aforementioned, there is a high shelf in the niche of the southern tower. The shelf (length: 2.6 m.; width: 0.5 m.) is about 90 cm. above the courtyard pavement; it is clear, therefore, that it functioned as a shelf, rather than as a bench. Since the northern niche is devoted to religious practices, it seems reasonable that the southern one served a similar purpose; it could, therefore, be another form of a high place.</page><page sequence="14">NOTES AND NEWS 135 A fierce conflagration destroyed the entire gate area. The second and perhaps the third floor filled the first floor, preserving it to this day. No attempt was ever made to restore this gate. Its destruction is attributed to the campaign of Tiglath pileser III, king of Assyria, on the basis of pottery analysis. Levels 4 and 3 (From the Assyrian and Babylonian Conquests to the End of the Persian Period) Unlike in Areas and C, there were no finds on top of the gate from this period. It seems that there was no attempt to rebuild the city gate during the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests. Level 2 (Hellenistic and Roman Periods) East of the Roman temple built above Chamber 3 of the Iron Age gate, there is a massive revetment wall, of which 8.5 m. were excavated. It was found to be built of large boulders, perhaps a reuse of the Iron Age tower boulders. Two buttresses were found at this wall, spanning 3 m. The southern buttress ends near a basalt stele, found embedded in the Iron Age pavement of Level 5. The purpose of this wall and the buttresses was to create a large podium on which the temple would have been built. Above the passageway and the southern city gate chambers, there was a structure containing two chambers. In the eastern slope there were remains of an additional chamber, west of which we found remnants of a levelled pavement. This indicates that large segments of this level are missing. The fa?ade of the Level 5 tower was fortified with another revetment wall built with small stones. Wall fragments in Square L 57 point to the existence of another building there, but the remains are too fragmentary to enable the reconstruction of a ground plan. The overall impression of the building in this area recalls the Hellenistic-Roman terrace buildings at Gamia. The major discovery was an elaborate handle of a bronze incense shovel. Level 1 (The Modern Period) This level contains all the late activities on the mound: the Bedouin tombs and the Syrian military trenches and disturbances of the 1950s and 1960s. These trenches were covered during the 1970s and 1980s by the Israel Defence Force engineering corps, and we had to clear them in order to prevent contamination of the lower layers. A 1.5 m. wide military trench was excavated from the eastern slope of the mound to the west. This trench runs into the passageway of the Iron Age gate in Squares M 55 and L 54, and cuts the Roman house into two parts. In Square 54 the trench splits and runs over the upper layers of Chamber 3 towards the north-west and through Chamber 1 to a bunker to its west. In addition, there were a few Bedouin tombs excavated to the Roman and Iron Age layers. Some of these tombs used dressed stones, most probably taken from the ruined Roman temple above Chamber 3. Area C Two squares, A 21 and 21, were excavated in this area. The purpose was to examine the inner face of the city wall, as well as another wall running perpendicular to it. A few years ago, a section of the city wall's outer face was unearthed here. An offset, running for 2 m., was discovered at the outer face of the city wall. The excavation of the inner face of the wall determined that there is a parallel offset there. The city wall at this area reached 7.5 m. in width; and at the inset section was 5.5 m. wide. During the Hellenistic period, the city wall was incorporated into a building. A perpendicular wall reaches the city wall</page><page sequence="15">136 NOTES AND NEWS and creates a broad opening next to it. The Hellenistic finds include pottery, large local amphora and three Tyrian silver coins dating from the fourth century B.C.E. Area E This area is located south of Area A, in what we have identified as the lower city. In order to establish the nature of the remains here and to examine walls that protruded above the ground, two squares, H 64 and H 65, were excavated in this area. Two main levels of occupation have been discovered so far: Level 1, dating from the Mamluk period (thirteenth-sixteenth centuries C.E.), and Level 2, dating from the Roman period. The latter consists of a well constructed building made of large field boulders and paved with large fieldstones. Two rooms have been found so far. Level 1 continued the use of this building, with one difference: a higher pavement was installed, consisting of relatively small fieldstones. The upper part of an Iron Age figurine with a Hathor hairdress was also found in the fill of the Mamluk building. She is covered with red slip, and her arms are not preserved. Rami Arav Sha'ar ha-Golan, 1998* The fifth season of excavation at the Yarmukian village of Shacar ha-Golan took place during July and August 1998. The excavation was directed by Y. Garfinkel and M. Miller, on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Funding for field survey and test squares was provided by the Curtiss T. and Mary G. Brennan Foundation. The excavation staff included: A. Eirich, D. Ben Shlomo, D. Dag, . Dunwoody, . Wallach, J. Lev-Tov, Z. Metzkevich, J. Rose and H. Clark. Other participants were: G. Rosenberg (surveyor), S. Itkis (magneto metric survey), S. Allen and J. Hansen (archaeobotany), and B. Hesse and D. Rookis (archaeozoology). Kibbutz Shacar ha-Golan provided major assistance in hosting the archaeological expedition and in making field arrangements. The Excavations The expedition's efforts focused upon the following goals: 1. Excavations in the main area next to the Yarmuk River, where the work was conducted during the four previous seasons. This area was extended to approximately 1,200 sq.m. (Fig. 1). 2. Archaeological survey of the site surface and its surroundings. Archaeological remains were found to extend over an area of at least 150 dunams. 3. In the south-western part of the site, some twenty trenches had been illegally dug by the local farmers, to get soil samples required for agricultural purposes. Walls and occupational levels were observed in some of these, while others were sterile. The expedition mapped these trenches, drew their sections and collected finds from their back dirt. 4. An additional excavation area was opened, approximately 400 m. to the north east of the main area, consisting of two probes c. 30 m. apart. Both produced broad stone walls of similar construction to those in the main excavation area. 5. A magnetometric survey was conducted over a 12 dunam area, adjacent to the main excavation area. Several large units were observed that may be interpreted as structures. Test excavations will be conducted in this area in the future in order to verify the survey's conclusions. 6. A flotation installation was constructed * Cf. IEJ 47 (1997), pp. 271-273.</page><page sequence="16">NOTES AND NEWS 137 Fig. 1. Shacar ha-Golan 1998: general view (looking east). for the collection of seeds and other botanical remains. A 10% sample of sediment was taken from each locus, with larger samples from features such as floors and hearths. During the course of the season, 6,000 litres of sediments were processed, and various types of seeds and other botanical material were found. In the main area, our excavation focused upon a second monumental structure, located to the west of the structure exposed in the 1997 season. This new structure, of which 500 sq.m. have been uncovered thus far, extends beyond the excavated area to the north and west; its full size is as yet unknown. Its eastern side is well preserved, consisting of a row of small rooms. Although the southern side was eroded by the Yarmuk River, the remaining portions indicate a row of rooms here too. At the centre of this complex there is a large open area, apparently a central courtyard. West of it were found mudbrick walls, which extend further to the west, beyond the excavation area, making it difficult to establish an architectural plan at this stage. The bricks are circular in shape with a plano-convex section. They are made of particularly light-coloured sediments, apparently originating in the Lisan geological formation. This monumental structure proved to be extremely rich in finds: numerous flint artefacts, pottery sherds, animal bones, some 40 figurines or figurine fragments and obsidian blades and flakes of exotic origin. Noteworthy among the art objects is a well-preserved figurine of fired clay (height: 14.5 cm.), depicting a seated woman (Fig. 2), of the type common at Yarmukian sites. Other figurines of previously unknown types were found, including four small anthropomorphic pillar figurines and a figurine depicting a female bending over, her hands holding knees and her head upon knees (perhaps depicting parturition).</page><page sequence="17">138 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 2.

YOSEF GARFINKEL AND MICHELE MILLER Tel Rekhesh, 1998 The Tel Rekhesh Regional Project is designed to address long-term patterns of settlement and land use in the Nahal Tavor gorge at and around Tel Rekhesh (Tell el-Muqarqash). The project is directed by Prof. A.H. Joffe (Department of Anthro pology, Pennsylvania State University). Research was undertaken from 17 July to 8 August 1998. Participants included Prof. L. Nordt (Department of Geology, Baylor University) and Profs. J. Hansen and P. Goldberg (Department of Archaeology, Boston University). Dr. R. Hall?te (Pennsylvania State University) assisted in analysing the ceramics. Graduate students from Pennsylvania State University also participated. The project was housed at Kibbutz Dor, and was aided in numerous ways by C. Arnon, director of the Archaeological Museum at the kibbutz. The Survey (Fig. 1) The pilot season had several major goals: 1) geoarchaeological study of Tel Rekhesh and its surroundings, with particular reference to landscape evolution (Nordt and Goldberg); 2) modern botanical survey of the area surrounding Tel Rekhesh (Hansen); and 3) intensive surface survey of the tell (Joffe). Another goal was the assessment of the potential for long-term interdisciplinary research, including excavations, at Tel Rekhesh. Initial results of the geoarchaeological survey indicate that Tel Rekhesh does not consist wholly of cultural material, but is rather constructed on a fault block underlain by Miocene and Pliocene bedrock at the confluence of Nahal Tavor and Nahal Rekhesh. Lower occupation levels around the base of the tell and underlying bedrock were possibly constructed on erosional fluvial. Nahal Tavor has impinged onto the east side of the tell, exposing large quantities of pottery and architectural material in a second context as colluvium. It appears that during meandering episodes, the wadi eroded the east side of the tell on at least two occasions. Based on descriptions of wadi cutbanks, five alluvial stratigraphie units were identified in the valley associated with the tell. Stratigraphie position and degree of soil development indicate that the two oldest units were deposited during the early</page><page sequence="18">NOTES AND NEWS 139 El Tdnekhe*hfM Fig. 1. Tel Rekhesh, 1998: site plan. to middle Holocene. The three most widespread stratigraphie units were deposited within the last 2,000 years, according to the presence of Roman Byzantine pottery. Each alluvial episode is capped by a paleosol. Sedimentological characteristics suggest that greater base flow existed during deposition of the early and middle Holocene units and that flashy discharge and high magnitude floods began by 2,000 yr B.P. The botanical survey was designed to contribute to environmental reconstruction and to provide a baseline of modern plants for comparison with future excavation results. According to several sources, slopes around Tel Rekhesh have not been under cultivation for many years and today part of the region is a preserve. Very little herbaceous vegetation was identifiable in July, and the botanical survey concentrated on the trees and shrubs along the wadi and on the slopes above. Among the dominant species is Ziziphus lotus (jujube), which grows to 5 m. in height and can be found on the lower terrace along the wadi. Caper, Capparis spinosa, was also prevalent on the tell and the lower slopes of the gorge.</page><page sequence="19">140 NOTES AND NEWS Along the streams Tamarix sp. (tamarisk), Smilax aspera (a vine) and Rubus sp. (raspberry) formed a dense thicket. The limestone slopes to the north of Tel Rekhesh were dotted with Sarcopoterium spinosum (spiny burnet), while this plant was absent from the basalt-based tell and slopes to the south. These regions, instead, had a number of almond trees (Prunus dulc?s) that were either vestiges of old groves or escapees from the numerous almond groves to the east and west of the tell. There was little vestige of the probable climax vegetation of the region which would have been an oak/pistachio forest. No oak of any species was seen in the area. The vegetation of the Tel Rekhesh area can be described as garigue or degraded maquis, which probably bears little resemblance to the natural climax vegetation that would have been still visible in some areas during the periods of occupation of the site. Surface survey of Tel Rekhesh was designed to intensively collect ceramic samples from different parts of the site, in order to determine the periods represented and the geography of settlement on and around the fault block. The distribution of ceramic materials suggests that the site was founded in the Chalcolithic period, probably at its northern edge near the confluence of Nahal Rekhesh and Nahal Tavor. The site was significantly enlarged during the Early Bronze Age. A settlement belt surrounding the fault block was constructed during the Early Bronze I Age, using terraces to build up flat areas along the flanks of the site above the floodplain. The terraces range from minor levelling above bedrock to very large platforms, several metres in height. Numerous support and terrace walls are visible in the highly eroded sections to the west and north, while the extent of settlement on the more gentle eastern slopes is difficult to measure. EB I ceramic materials appear more closely related to Jezreel Valley types, and little Grain Wash pottery, more typical of the Jordan Valley, was found. The presence of EB II-III Metallic Ware, including platter bowls and pitchers, indicates settlement in those later phases. The site reached its greatest extent (c. 4-5 hectares) during the Early Bronze Age, although it is unclear how much of the upper surfaces of the fault block was occupied. A tentative suggestion is that EB I settlement was the largest, with some contraction in the Early Bronze Age II-III. Basalt appears to have been the favoured construction material. A few possible EB IV sherds were found (n=3). Later settlements are restricted to the small (c. 1.5-2 hectare) upper surfaces of the fault block and also employ terraces for levelling. Settlement in the Middle Bronze Age appears the most extensive, with progressively smaller Late Bronze, Iron I and Iron II occupations. Some area of these settlements has been lost to erosion on the eastern side of the site. Considerable MB-LB architecture, consisting of walls over 20 m. in length oriented north-south, with smaller east-west transverse walls forming rooms along the long axis, is visible on the eastern crest of the site. No Iron Age architecture could be defined. A large structure, c. 40 40 m., on the summit of the site, consisting of rooms around an open space, was not sampled, due to heavy vegetation and time constraints, although a Byzantine date is suspected. Limestone appears to been the favoured construction material in the Middle Bronze Age and later. Very large quantities of pottery from all phases of the Middle Bronze Age were recovered, particularly from the eroded upper eastern slopes of the site; they included numerous storage jars and bowls. Smaller quantities of Late Bronze, Iron I and Iron II sherds were also recovered, as well as a few possible Persian period</page><page sequence="20">NOTES AND NEWS 141 sherds, and the ubiquitous background noise of Roman-Byzantine material. The results of the 1998 survey support and amplify the conclusions of early reconnaissances by A. Saarisalo, N. Zori and Z. Gal. Goals for future survey include determining the geography and chronology of Early Bronze Age and later settlement development, mapping architectural remains, investigation of local agricultural potential, and the expansion of geo archaeological investigations. Alexander H. Joffe, Julie Hansen, lee nordt and paul goldberg Neolithic Site ofAshkelon (AfiidarAreaL), 1997, 1998* The one-period Neolithic site of Ashkelon is located at the sea shore, about 1.5 km. north of Tel Ashkelon. It was first excavated by J. Perrot in the mid 1950s, and the final report of that investigation was recently published. During March 1997 and between March and May 1998, extensive salvage excavations were conducted at the site, directed by Y. Garfinkel on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The excavation staff included: A. Davidson, A. Eirich, Y. Mizrahi, D. Dag, Z. Metzkevich, V Barzel Ben-Haim and M. Rogel. Other participants were: P. Philips and G. Rosenberg (surveying), E. Barzilai (geomorphology), B. Hesse (archaeozoology) and B. Boaz (photography). The excavation was funded by the Ashkelon Economic Development Corporation. The Excavations In accordance with development at the adjacent Ashkelon marina, an area of 1,000 sq.m. was excavated from topsoil to virgin soil. The following stratigraphy was observed at the site: 1. Approximately 0.5 m. of sand and modern debris, including the remains of a kiosk that had stood at the site, numerous glass bottles, coloured ceramics, electrical and telephone wires, and sewage pipes. 2. Approximately 1.5 m. of yellow sea sand, including a variety of Byzantine and Islamic period sherds (including several glazed sherds). 3. Several pits filled with yellow sea sand, including Byzantine sherds. 4. Three pits containing finds from the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Along the shore at Ashkelon, in the Afridar and Barnea neighbourhoods, an extensive settlement dating from this period is known to have extended over several hundred dunams (A. Golani: Ashqelon, Hajar cId, Excavations and Surveys in Israel 16 [1997], pp. 122-123; E. Braun and R. Gophna: Ashqelon, Afridar, Excavations and Surveys in Israel 15 [1996], pp. 97-98). 5. A Neolithic settlement layer, extending over the entire excavation area. The thickness of this dark brown layer ranges from 20 cm. to 2 m. It consists of clay and sand, containing burnt stones, lumps of fired clay, animal bones and implements made of bone and stone. It is noteworthy that no pottery was found in the excavation, but a few fragments of White Ware vessels were unearthed. Clearly, this is a Pre Pottery Neolithic site. 6. Virgin soil; in the western portion, consisting of husmas (eroded kurkar); in the eastern portion, of brown clay. In the Neolithic settlement, the following features were observed: * J. Perrot: Ashkelon, IEJ 5 (1955), pp. 270-272; J. Perrot and A. Gopher: A Late Neolithic Site near Ashkelon, IEJ 46 (1996), pp. 145-166.</page><page sequence="21">142 NOTES AND NEWS Hearths. Some 80 distinct hearths were found, most lying directly on virgin soil, with some recessed into the ground in shallow pits. The hearths are round or oval, constructed of medium-sized and small stones, densely laid and touching one another (Figs. 1, 2). In some cases, the edges of the pits were reddish-orange as a result of the fire. Fig. 2. Ashkelon 1998: hearth consisting of small and medium-sized fieldstones and lumps of fired clay. Pits. In addition to the shallow ones used as hearths, other pits of various sizes were found. These are few, scattered and distant from one another. Some of the pits are regular in outline, while others are bell-shaped. Occupational surfaces. On virgin soil and some 10-20 cm. above virgin soil we found occupational surfaces exception ally rich in finds. These included large quantities of animal bones (Fig. 3). Walls. Architectural finds include only 20 m. of a single wall. Floors. A small, levelled surface of light coloured material, perhaps including some crushed chalk, was found associated with the wall in the west. Upon this surface there was a variety of finds: an arrowhead, a denticulated sickle blade and an obsidian blade. Fig. 1. Ashkelon 1998: concentration of hearths in Neolithic layer.</page><page sequence="22">notes and news 143 Fig. 3. Ashkelon 1998: cattle jawbones in Neolithic layer. Assorted finds include: flint implements (tools and debitage), stone tools, polished stone bracelets, obsidian blades and flakes, ostrich egg shell fragments, bone implements, shells and some beads. The flint assemblage is characterised by the following features: arrowheads are generally medium in size, with only a few larger and longer ones, in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic tradition, or small, in the Pottery Neolithic tradition. Sickle blades include rectangular specimens with broad, deep denticulation, typical of the Pottery Neolithic. A good sample of long knives (10-12 cm.) made of thin, tabular flint was found. An unusual feature was the large number of animal bones, which constitute the majority of the finds at the Neolithic site at Ashkelon (Fig. 3). This, combined with the hearths and the tabular flint knives appears to indicate that the site was used for intensive processing and preservation of meat. In this connection, the proximity to the sea should be noted, as it constitutes a source of salt, an important meat preservation agent. The flint assemblage is typical of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C and includes medium-sized arrowheads and sickle blades with broad, deep denticulation. Five C14 dates received recently fall into a range of 7,900 B.P. (uncalibrated). yosef garfinkel OBITUARIES Pirhiya Beck, a renowned archaeologist and art historian of the ancient Near East, passed away on 28 August 1998 in Tel Aviv at the age of 67. Pirhiya Beck was born in Poland in 1931, and grew up in Israel. After graduating from the teachers' seminary in Haifa, she began learning Biblical studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and was 'infected' with the 'archaeology bug' while working on the excavations of the Canaanite temple at Nahariya as a student. She received her B. A. and M. A. in Bible and archaeology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From 1961 to 1967 she studied in the United States: in 1961 at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and then at Colombia University in New York, where she wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on 'Problems in the Glyptic Art of Palestine', under the supervision of Prof. Edith Porada, a world expert in ancient Near Eastern art. After completing her dissertation in 1967, she returned to Israel. She was among the founders of the Department of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University, where she taught archaeology and Near Eastern art until her death, and headed the department for two consecutive terms (1985-1989). For two periods, in 1969-1970 and again in 1974, she served as the curator of the ceramics pavilion at Ha'aretz Museum (now the Eretz Israel Museum). Prof. Pirhiya Beck was an expert on all aspects of local archaeology. She gained</page><page sequence="23">144 notes and news wide experience in field archaeology: at the excavations of Hazor and Arad, and since 1972 as co-director with Prof. Moshe Kochavi of the long-term excavations at Aphek and in the Land of Geshur. She focused on the study of pottery, collaborating with Ruth Amiran and Uzza Zevulun in preparing the corpus of Ancient Pottery in the Holy Land (Jerusalem, 1963), in which she contributed the material on the Iron Age. Her publication of MB IIA pottery from Aphek laid sound foundations for the understanding of this previously little known aspect of material culture. Shortly before her death, she submitted for publication the volume Aphek I (with Moshe Kochavi), as well as a summary volume on the excavations and finds from the Tillar House' at Tel Hadar (with Moshe Kochavi and Esther Yadin). As an art historian, Pirhiya Beck combined in a unique manner Near Eastern and local aspects of ancient art. Following the topic of her dissertation, she continued to study and publish cylinder and stamp seals of various periods: a Neolithic stamp seal from Shacar ha-Golan, Early Bronze seals from Arad and Megiddo, Middle Bronze seals from Tel Aphek and Lachish and Late Bronze ones from Hazor and Akko. Her preoccupation with the iconography and symbolic value of cult objects is evident in numerous publications, such as the study of several objects from the Nahal Mishmar hoard (1989), or her paper on a new type of female figurine (1986). Her work on the sculpture from Hazor (1989) revised the accepted notions of style, iconography and chronology of these outstanding cult objects. She dealt with Iron Age iconography in her seminal studies on the drawings of Kuntillet cAjrud (1988) and the cult stands from Taanach (1994) and Hazeva (1996). Her monograph, containing the catalogue and study of the iconography of Horvat Qitmit art (1995), is an exemplary work, in which local art is viewed against the background of Near Eastern art. Two of her papers ? one on art in the Early Bronze Age (1995) and the other on the image of the ruler in the Middle Bronze Age (1998) ? were to be incorporated in a definitive volume on the ancient art of Israel within the context of the ancient Near East. The Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University plans to publish a collection of her articles in a special volume to be dedicated to her in mem?ri?m. Pirhiya Beck was first and foremost a teacher. Her meticulous attention to detail, her unfailing willingness to invest of her time and energy, her warmth and, above all, her never-ending desire to teach and to educate were her hallmarks, forging strong bonds with her students. The seminar on ancient art that she had held at her home since 1992 attracted students and colleagues alike. Her untimely passing has left a void in the lives of all those who were close to her? family, friends, colleagues and students. Moshe Prausnitz, prehistorian and archaeologist, passed away in Jerusalem on 1 July 1998. Born in Berlin in 1922, he immigrated to Israel with his family at the age of 15 and settled in Haifa. He left for Edinbourgh University in Scotland after World War II, where he studied with Prof. Stuart Pigott, the renowned British prehistorian. When he returned to Israel, he continued his studies at the prehistoric division of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of Prof. Moshe Stekelis, and received his Ph.D. in 1966. In 1951, Moshe Prausnitz began work as an archaeologist at the Department of Antiquities and Museums (later to become the Israel Antiquities Authority), where he continued to work until his retirement. At</page><page sequence="24">NOTES AND NEWS 145 first he dealt primarily with prehistoric periods: he excavated various prehistoric sites, such as Tel Ali (Alumot) in the Yavne'el Valley, Kabri and Evron in the Western Galilee, and Neve Yam, Macagan Mikhael and Herzliya on the Mediter ranean coast. He published excavation reports on these sites, as well as a number of articles that dealt with various aspects of the prehistory of Israel: on the first agricultural settlements in the Galilee, on the palaeolithic flint industry, and on the nature of the Kabbaric and Nattufian cultures. He published From Hunter to Farmer and Trader (Jerusalem, 1970), based upon his Ph.D. dissertation. His work at the Israel Antiquities Authority led him to broaden his interests to other historical periods. He excavated at sites from a variety of periods, including Early and Middle Bronze Age sites, such as Rosh ha-Niqra, Quneitra and Yascur, as well as Roman-Byzantine sites, such as the churches at Hanita and at Shavei Zion, and synagogues in the Western Galilee. He published excavation reports, at times in collaboration with his colleagues; he wrote about Early Bronze cylinder seals, and in 1967, together with M. Avi-Yonah, published a monograph on the church at Shavei Zion. Moshe Prausnitz's excavation of the cemetery at Akhziv was to alter the course of his professional interests. Since the mid-'60s until his death, he was concerned with topics related to the Akhziv excavations: various aspects of the Phoenician burial customs and the stratigraphy of the tomb; the typology of Phoenician ceramics and their development between the tenth and the seventh centuries B.C.E.; and the relations of Israel with Phoenicia and Cyprus. He lectured on these topics in this country and overseas, and published articles in the scientific press. It is hoped that his research, summing up his excavations of the Akhziv grave sites, will be published posthumously by the Israel Antiquities Authority in the near future.</page></plain_text>
