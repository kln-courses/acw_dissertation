<plain_text><page sequence="1">VANDERLIP (V. F.) The four Greek hymns of Isidorus and the cult of Isis. (American studies in papyrology, 12.) Toronto: A. M. Hakkert. 1972. Pp. xvi + Io8. 14 Plates. Price $20. At a time when interest in the cult of Isis is on the increase the publication of this scholarly work (a Ph.D. dissertation revised and expanded) is very welcome. It is a largish volume, and Isidorus is represented (epigraphically) by only some 142 verses (hexameter and elegiac). The authoress, acknowledging the help and advice given by the late C. B. Welles, and R. Merkelbach, first considers the evidence for the date of the four hymns, for which she supplies text, translation and commentary. Especially useful is the detailed line-by-line study, hymn by hymn-about half of the whole book. She goes on to discuss the spread of the cult of Isis under the early Ptolemies, and the aretalogies of the goddess. She provides an appendix as 'a brief summary of Isidorus' commoner linguistic features' (though her statistical analysis would carry more weight if we had before us other examples of Isidorus, and not just a somewhat meagre ouput of stylised verses). His language, we are told, belongs to the Fayum society of his day (p. 97). More telling surely are the overtones of epic poetry, especially Hesiod (e.g. the epithet upipoop in III, 3, which as V notes turns up in the Andros hymn). Careful sifting of the evidence (externally, from the construction of the piers on which the Hymn in- scriptions were found in 1935, and internally from two passages which appear to contain allusions to contemporary events) leads to the choice of 88 B.C. as the terminus post quem for the production. The Pharaonic monarch who by gross hyperbole 'rules both Asia and Europe' (III, 13) is Ptolemy IX, Soter II, to whom (p. 15) the Hymns 'are both strong political and religious statements of loyalty'. This is a safe enough conclusion. Medinet Madi, the village near which was discovered the Graeco-Roman temple with the inscriptions (as well as the interesting figures of Isermuthis shown in plates XI-XIV), lies in the far south of the Fayum (p. 3). From the time of Ptolemy II the Fayum area flourished and Greek and indigenous institutions grew closer together: 'large, prosperous temple establishments, as in the rest of Egypt, became in the Fayum religious focal points for all inhabitants' (p. 60). Significantly, almost the whole of Hymn IV is taken up with the story of the folk-hero 'Pharaoh Manres' who con- trolled the Fayum Lake waters (p. 67). In a footnote (p. 93) V. recognises the historical con- tinuity in the Fayum of the Mother-and-Child iconography, first Isis-Horus and then Theotokos- Galaktotrophousa. Like the other aretalogists- at Andros (A), in Diodorus Siculus (D), at Gomphoi (G), at los (J), at Cyme (K), and at Salonica (S) - Isidorus is silent about Isis the suckling Mother. Furthermore, although at Medinet Madi Isis and Hermuthis (as Nurse of the Infant) were indissolubly one (cf. pp. 19-20) and Isis could be a serpent with human head (p. 7, and plates XII-XIII), yet in the actual text theriomorphic ideas are conspicuously absent. This is all the more remarkable, as the so-called Litany of Isis, found not far away at Oxyrhynchus, does not exclude such epithets as doiwr, yv:adTUopqIoc, and Tavpc63om (PO 1380, I1.58.66. 107). The Fayum psalmist (pp. 93-4) treats Isis-Her- muthis-Isermuthis-as a Person and Mother. She is purely anthropomorphic, in his inspired invocation. She is the One (Thiouis, Hymn I, 23) 'who forever listens to men's prayers' (p. 7). Here V. might well have mentioned the (admittedly suprapersonal) One of Plotinus, to which Isis, the One and the Unique, seems to offer a very close parallel (cf. Isis in the Graeco-Roman World, p. 307). The suggestion that Isidorus' goddess 'could be descended from Aton of the Amarna hymn' (p. 6) is certainly attractive. When V. refers (ibid.) to</page><page sequence="2">216 NOTICES OF BOOKS Akhnaten's Hymn to the Aton, there is room for a mention of the aretalogical expression that Isis is 'in the rays of the Sun' and of the Plotinian theory of the Sun's light irradiated as an incorporeal and undiminished giving (cf. IsisGrRoWrd, p. 237 and my remarks in JHS 1968, p. 199). Chapter Five in discussing Isis' characterisation starts with a reference to the Pyramid Texts but strangely omits all mention of the Lamentations. Of this early feature, surviving in the cult down the long centuries, the Greek aretalogies tell us nothing-and the fact ought to have been noted by V. We have been told just before (p. 91) that the sections of the Hymns concerning Isis as a Discoverer and Universal Deity are specifically Hellenistic. But the conception of Isis as the 'great Mage', the spellbinder who discovers cures and secrets, is a sold as the Ebers Papyrus and prepares the way for the much later equation with a Greek Discoverer-god, evp-'rpta, cogila (cf. pp 4-5). Here V. could well have glanced at aoqpla in the Wisdom of Solomon, which W. L. Knox has linked with Isis (cf. IsisGrRo Wrd, p. 312). After Alexander, of course, Isis assumed certain unfamiliar functions. But often their germ can be found if we delve deep enough into her Egyptian past. To write (p. 91) of the emergence of Isis as a 'strong new [my italics] Hellenistic deity which, like new wine, bursts through the form of the Hellenistic hymn' is surely exuberant eulogy. On p. 92 V. seems to be indecisive as to what is really early, and late, in tradition. R. E. WITT London</page></plain_text>
