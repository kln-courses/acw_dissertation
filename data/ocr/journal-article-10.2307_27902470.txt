<plain_text><page sequence="1">FUNCTIONS OF KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION Among philosophers of religion working prior to the nineteenth century, Immanuel Kant is preeminently useful to understand. For it is his statement of the problems (incorporating the difficulties raised by the Enlightenment and Hume) and his lines of solution which are most widely known, and taken as the point of departure for subsequent criticisms and new interpretations of religion, It is natural for Fichte and Schleiermacher to build out from him and often against him, just as it is his treatment of ethics and religion that most excites the new generation of university students, notably Schelling, Hegel, and then Schopenhauer. Directly or indirectly, Kant's impact con tinues to be felt by such diverse minds as Kierkegaard and the Marxists, Feuerbach and the positivists, Nietzsche and the so-called British Hegelians. Since Kant furnishes the closest approximation to a joint historical reference field for these nineteenth-century philosophers of religion, to study him is already to gain some comprehension of what they are doing and why they think as they do in this area. Hence my aim here is to present some major Kantian positions on religion, and to do so in a twofold functional way. The main emphasis will be upon internal functions, that is, upon how Kant's theory of religion affects and is affected by the rest of his own thought. This will be done by con sidering that theory's respective relations with the nature of philosophy, the analysis of knowledge, the ethical domain, and the sphere of unitive hope. A brief final section will treat of the religious component in the characteristic Kantian manner of propounding the question of man to his successors. This constitutes for us a convenient continuity function, pointing toward the main subjects of the present collection of essays. /. Religion and the Meaning of Philosophy Generations of students have gratefully used the framework which Kant himself provided for organizing his complex investigations and writings.1 What Is Philosophy? 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope? 4. (unifying 1, 2, 3): What Is Man?</page><page sequence="2">158 JAMES COLLINS Although this outline seems simple, it cost Kant himself considerable ef fort to formulate, and contains some concealed difficulties for an interpreter. Viewed by us in retrospect, the first three questions have the obvious advan tage of correlating respectively with the three Kantian powers of man (think ing, willing, feeling), as well as with the three Critiques (Pure Reason, Prac tical Reason, Judgment). But a slightly deeper probe uncovers many problems that this neat correlation tends to gloss over. Without canvassing all the issues, I will select five points involving Kant's study of religion which cast some illumination upon his intent. (a) The incidence of "what" in the above outline predisposes us to expect a content-type of answer to each of the questions. Kant corrects this misex pectation promptly, as far as concerns the general question about philosophy. Its reality consists primarily of the very act of philosophizing in accord with a critical method, and only secondarily of this or that item of doctrinal content. Such items take on distinctive meaning, from philosopher to philosopher, mainly by reference to the activating method used by each to determine an argument. But Kant usually postpones his corrective comment on the specific parts of philosophy until his actual treatment of the topics begins. In the case of religion, the emendation is unmistakably made by shifting the emphasis from this or that content of a credal statement or doctrinal theology to the act of believing and the disposition toward a certain active interpreting of human life. Whether it be a way of taking moral duties as divine commands or a searching for God's presence amid worldly evils and disasters, the what of Kantian religious theory is always subordinated to the how or the primacy of action and active disposition. Content questions on religion are not eliminated, but responses to them are forthcoming from the philosopher of religion only through reference to his qualifying analyses of methods and acts. (b) In line with this approach is the repeated use of the first-person singular pronoun in the three specific questions. As it were, Kant presses home the point that methods and acts are not dynamic sufficiencies but are, rather, the instruments and expressions of inquiring persons. Hence the philosophical questions actually concern the conditions making it possible for the human agent to know, to do, and to hope. Kant realizes that this stress on personal agency can lead one to interpret his philosophy in an individualistic, or even a solipsistic, vein not intended. Hence he requires some perseverance in the actual inquiry, so that we may learn that the validity of knowledge claims, moral norms, and grounds of hope depends upon the sharing of in terpersonal conditions, recognized and realized by the individual but in prin ciple not confined to him.</page><page sequence="3">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 159 The inclusion of a theory of religion among philosophical tasks helps considerably to establish the intersubjective perspective. For the religious believer pronounces his credo, his "I believe," along with other believers and with respect to a jointly formulated and jointly held profession of faith. Moreover, the presence of the religious community or kingdom of God is directly experienced and acknowledged, often before one becomes aware of the scientific community and its shared requirements.2 Understanding of the Kantian meaning of philosophy is advanced when the former community im parts its experienced need for shareability to the latter and when, reciprocal ly, the scientific community imparts the need for critical rigor to the study of religion. (c) Kant arouses our keen interest, if nothing more, by elevating the question of hope to the level of a primary division of his philosophy. Here, he moves contrary to the long standing philosophical tradition of reserving a definite, but modestly subordinate, niche for the analysis of hope. It usually appears as one subsection in the study of human passions, often being cou pled with fear and associated with mankind's proneness to gullibility. Theologians did assign a higher role to hope, as one of the chief theological virtues, but they so sterilized this virtue and disputed about its relation with faith that it became detached from the ordinary concerns of philosophers. By establishing hope as a major concern in philosophy, Kant is critical of both these historical modes of its treatment. It looms larger in human life than the specialized theory of passions or even than Hume's cyclic account would allow, and consequently it takes more shapes and requires a more generalized methodology than is furnished by theological treatises. The religious mind (not necessarily the theological one) keeps us alive to the pervasiveness and range of human hopes, thus lending at least prima facie reasonableness to Kant's suggestion that the problem of hope is a central philosophical concern.3 (d) Another issue raised by the initial outline is whether philosophy segregates "know," "do," and "hope," or seeks to interrelate them and the analyses thereof. Kant has two devices for handling this matter. First, in the course of developing his actual critique of any one of these usages, he in variably speaks about the interest which the other two have in a true settle ment of the inquiry.4 This is most striking, of course, when his examination of "can know" and the general conditions and limitations of its rightful use leads him to predict that his conclusions will permit a sounder exploration to be made of the domains of "ought to do" and "may hope." Yet in actually making his inspection of doing and hoping, Kant also perfects conceptual in struments which, he is careful to remark explicitly, will further refine his previous positions on knowing. Such retrospective remarks occur frequently</page><page sequence="4">160 JAMES COLLINS in his consideration of the religious meanings of belief, freedom, and will. This is a signal to us that, until Kant works out his theory of religion, we must keep open our understanding of previous questions and be prepared for mak ing some retroactive modifications. His second means for keeping open in principle the pathways between reflection on "know," "do," and "hope" is already built into the guiding out line. For all these themes are finally united in the synthesizing question: "What is Man?" The specific subject matters are operations of man; statements about them have man as their source and clarifying goal; and their corresponding Critiques follow the law of mutual openness and ultimate con vergence. (e) But the crucial use of the term "Man" can be construed in another sense, as meaning that philosophy is the study of human reality and not of anything else. Kant would both allow and disallow this interpretation. It is acceptable if, by "anything else," one means a reality-claim that is in no way founded upon human experience in its Kantian analysis. About such a claim, Kant would be prepared to state that it has no valid philosophical support and hence that his philosophy must remain silent about it; or, more strongly, that its explication contradicts some finding of his philosophy of man and hence must be rejected. But the proposed interpretation is inacceptable if "anything else" signifies something not reducible to man and yet found, by critical ex amination, to be related to man in his several types of experiencing. The act of philosophizing studies man relationally: as knowing the rest of nature, as determining his conduct by moral laws of freedom, and as finding reasonable grounds of hoping for further realization through the resources of art, history, and religion. Laws of freedom and orientation to God keep open the study of man, so that it will not become prematurely closed to everything but the man-nature model of reality. The theory of religion belongs in a human philosophy, precisely because some aspects of our experience of living-morally-in-nature contain hopeful suggestions that our search after God bears practically upon that experience and its further understanding. In the remainder of this essay, each of Kant's leading questions on the nature of philosophy will be separately considered. I will concentrate upon a few salient regions where the mutual relationships between the main in terrogation and his conception of religion become significant enough to affect the course of nineteenth-century thinking on religion. 2. Religion and "What Can I Know?" Studying Kant's works with a special concern for their religious bearing makes one reluctant to accept unqualifiedly the customary periodization into</page><page sequence="5">KANTS PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 161 the precriticai and the critical writings. This distinction serves as a useful marker of the new questions and projects which occupied Kant during the years 1770-81, as well as of the pivotal importance of the actual publication of the first Critique in 1781?heralding a crowded decade of publishing the other Critiques and shorter writings. But no implication can be drawn that the "precritical" years were uncritical in the ordinary sense or were discon tinuous with positions taken in Kant's later writings. To avoid this evalua tion, it may be better to refer to the "pre-Critique" years and to judge the publications of 1755-70 by their own philosophical quality, as well as by their permanent contributions to Kant's philosophical growth.5 Such cautious reference is specially required in order to weigh the import of his early treatment of God and religion. From the very outset, two qualities of Kant's mind are clearly visible: his personal belief in theism and his resolve to probe unsparingly into every philosophical argument known by him to sup port or attack the acceptance of God. There is a reflective calmness about the early Kant's theism, accompanied in his personal life by dissatisfaction with, and detachment from, all institutional forms of worship (including Pietism which, by his generation, had become socially and intellectually a part of the religious establishment). And in his intellectual work, this same honest in dependence showed itself in his persistent critical analysis of the current philosophical presuppositions about God and proofs of his existence. Were it not for this quarter-century of disciplined questioning, Kant would not have been prepared to participate prominently in that remarkable quickening of interest in the nature of religion occuring in Germany from 1780 onwards. Each step in Kant's pre-Critique research made it more difficult to specify the evidentiary basis for philosophical theism. His New Exposition (1755) drives a deep wedge between the components in the classical phrase of Spinoza and Leibniz: "reason or cause."6 There are reasons that are noncausal, namely, those that determine only the logical relation between ground-and-consequent and not the existential relation between cause-and effect. No subtle verging toward the boundaries of a logical ground-and consequent relationship can convert itself into an existentially real one. This rules out any a priori determination of God's own existence from appeal to the perfection of the idea of God, which serves only as a logical ground as far as our finite human understanding can formulate it. What rationalists forget is that no appeal can be made indiscriminately to sufficient reason, without specifying this principle's binary relation with existential act and with our human intelligence and its limits. Kant's two essays of 1762-64 broaden the scope of his criticism.7 His Only Possible Basis of Proof shows respect for Leibniz's way of reaching God as the foundation in actuality for all real experienced possibilities, a point on</page><page sequence="6">162 JAMES COLLINS which Leibniz had departed from Spinoza's opposition to any philosophical affirmation of such possibilities. At least this is a sounder approach than that based on our idea of the abstract possibility of the infinitely perfect essence, from the analysis of which idea we can never derive the "more" of divine ex istence. It is also sounder than that which moves from the note of contingency drawn from the dependent world to an absolutely independent thing, a path which cannot assure us, from conceptual entailment alone, that this indepen dent entity is unconditionally necessary and existentially real. Yet already at this time, Kant concedes that the movement of our com mon understanding and religious searching from the order and harmony of the experienced world to God is an agelong, arresting inference. It cannot strictly prove that the ordering mind, reached thereby, is anything more than a cosmic artisan, a finite maker-God rather than an infinite creator of the en tire reality of the universe. Kant attributes to revealed religion the clearcut distinction between a maker and a creator God. As an abstract basis for every proof of the existing infinite God, he concludes somewhat reluctantly and vaguely that we must argue from real possibility present in actual things to a universal and actual source of the experienced possibility. Since the removal of this source would disrupt the internal consistency of things we do en counter, Kant seems ready to grant almost mathematical certainty to this route. The only difficulty is that, in his essay on The Distinctness of the Prin ciples of Natural Theology and Ethics, he moves away from the synthetic method used in constructing pure mathematical concepts to the analytic method of clarification and inference, as found in Newtonian natural philosophy. The latter method assures an existential grounding in our ex perience and advances toward a terminal clarity and distinctness, rather than beginning definitionally with it. But if natural theology follows the latter path for its humane existential grounding, it must also accept the consequence of remaining within the bounds set upon human experience. This permits a religious orienting of the inquirer toward God, without assuring him philosophically of a fully clear and distinct knowledge of God. Two other problems arise for the searcher after God who seeks to adapt Newtonian reasoning to his quest. One is that the physical nature of the star ting point of such reasoning may perhaps not permit us to attain to anything more than a physicalized conception of God. This has the accompanying dif ficulty about reconciling the course of nature with God's free agency and moral purposes. Kant's second problem now becomes understandable. To assure some philosophical standing for the moral-existential view of a free and morally good God, proportionate to a human religious response, he</page><page sequence="7">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 163 proposes that a closer alliance be established between natural theology and moral philosophy. The implications of such a realignment toward moral theism are, Kant readily admits, too complex to be grasped and exposited at once. For this reason, he concludes the Basis of Proof with the remark that while we must convince ourselves of God's existence, it is not equally necessary to demonstrate that existence. The pre-Critique Kant has fun damentally set forth his objections against the three kinds of speculative proofs of God's existence which will occupy the Dialectic section of the Critique of Pure Reason. And by drawing the philosophical theory of God and religion closer to the realm of practical reasoning, he has already de tached the former from his increasingly radical criticism of any transcendent metaphysics. Neither theistic religion nor morals is mortally affected by the entomological surgery suggested in Kant's Dreams of a Visionary (1766), namely, that we should clip the butterfly wings of metaphysics.8 This would prevent human reason from soaring speculatively beyond man's horizon of experience and the limits of his own powers. It is salutary for moral theism and religious belief to become associated with a severely limited notion of transcendental metaphysics, which studies the common structure and boun daries of our knowing, along with the distinction between knowledge, belief, and illusion. Thus the cautious moral and religious strand in Kant's early thinking reinforces other ingredients to mold the Critique of Pure Reason as a restraining instrument against extravagant epistemic claims in metaphysics. Moving now directly into this book, I propose to show briefly that each of its major divisions is further elucidated by bearing in mind Kant's permanent in terest in the philosophy of religion. (a) The Esthetic opens abruptly with the declaration that in whatever manner and by whatever means a mode of knowledge may relate to objects, intuition is that through which it is in immediate relation to them, and to which all thought as a means is directed. But intuition takes place only in so far as the object is given to us. This again is only possible, to man at least, in so far as the mind is affected in a certain way. The capacity (receptivity) for receiving representations through the mode in which we are affected by objects, is entitled sensibility_In the transcendental aesthetic we shall, therefore, first isolate sen sibility, by taking away from it everything which the understanding thinks through its concepts, so that nothing may be left save empirical intuition. Secondly, we shall also separate off from it everything which belongs to sensa tion, so that nothing may remain save pure intuition and the mere form of appearances.9 Although Kant plunges us directly into these definitions and programs, he</page><page sequence="8">164 JAMES COLLINS himself reached them only through the arduous reflections of the decade 1770-81. Specially noteworthy in the quoted text is its movement from intuition in general to the ways in which it is found in men. Through the unobtrusive use of "we," "us," and "to man at least" (added in edition B, so as to make the transition unmistakable), Kant goes from the common features of any intui tion to those characterizing human sensuous intuition, in its empirical and pure-form-of-sensibility conditions. Guiding this passage from intuition to specifically human intuition is his notion of what the divine intuition would be like. Kant uses the direct relation of God's mind to objects as a negative model for demarcating and naming the traits of human intuition. The intuition of a divine archetypal mind is active, since it is causally related both to things and to their presentations in knowledge. It is also intellectual, since it operates without forms of receptivi ty and states of being affected. By reflecting upon this notion of divine know ing, Kant can sharply distinguish the type of intuition proper to man: it must be receptive and sensible, whether empirically or purely so. This theory turns about the distinction between an archetypal, unde rived, creatively causal mind and an ectypal, derived, and sensibly affected mind. Although we cannot strictly know the former, we can at least form a model of it to determine, by strategic contrasts, that the intuition of a human knower is not intellectual and purely active, but is receptive in a fashion in volving pure forms of sensibility and empirical acts of sensation. Indeed, when human intuition is considered in its full concretion, Kant refers to it as "our sensible and empirical intuition," lest man's pure intuition forget its formal-sensible constitution and object, and seek the metaphysical status of intellectual activity proper to the divine mind alone. Kantian philosophy of religion respects this difference by relying upon moral experience, rather than metaphysical insight, in the practical questions of God, evil, and hope. (b) Throughout the Analytic, there runs a crucial distinction between the schematized and the unschematized condition of the categories.10 Only when the categories or pure concepts of the understanding are coadapted to sensible intuition of objects through the synthesizing schemata of imag ination, do we gain speculative experiential knowledge. Negatively, this means that rigorous knowledge cannot transcend the aspects and relations among sensibly experienced objects, together with the human knower's struc tural conditions making such objective knowledge possible. But there is also a positive consequence which, in the longer perspective of Kantian philosophiz ing, becomes increasingly important. It is that man the knower of nature does incorporate into his judgments thereon those pure categorial meanings that</page><page sequence="9">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 165 get adaptively schematized. These meanings provide the human inquirer into ethical and religious life with a fund for further investigations, without con travening the limits set for the speculative study of experienced objects in nature. The active presence of physically unschematized meanings serves several functions. First, it encourages, enables, and at times obliges the thoughtful person to keep his philosophical reflections open, rather than to close them off with an account of physical knowledge, Next, it suggests that the unifying ideas of soul-world-God are not inherently contradictory, since they represent broader syntheses of categorial meanings. Admittedly, these syntheses can be misinterpreted as yielding knowledge of their objects in the same sense as physical knowledge. But such misinterpretations are not irremediable, and hence the unifying syntheses themselves are sound and open to other con struals in the practical contexts of morality and religion. Third, what makes these latter contexts open to critical study is the fact that Kant does not require the pure categorial meanings and divisions to re main in the state of intellectually futile vacuity, apart from their schematiza tion for purposes of natural science and the speculative analysis of mind. Instead, he leaves open the possibility of finding, on other grounds connected with man's practical self-scrutiny, new modes of schematization and new principles of analogy for guiding the use of practically schematized meanings. In principle, the schemata and analogies of experience set forth in the first Critique arouse the ethicist and philosopher of religion to look for somewhat similar concretizations of, and adaptive controls over, judgments concerning their areas of human life. Here is another instance of a "more" toward which our practical needs incline us and which, in turn, generates the development of critical philosophy beyond the confines of the first Critique. (c) What Kant himself calls "the highly complicated web of human knowledge" manifests its complexity nowhere more strikingly than in the Dialectic, especially the section on God or the ideal of pure reason.11 The common practice of detaching the three proofs of God's existence from their determining context, and giving them a formal but isolated restatement and criticism, gives one an illusory sense of complete comprehension. One task of philosophy of religion is to dissolve this illusion, not only by restoring the arguments to the full context of Kant's reflections on the ideal of pure reason but also by relating this entire section to his concurrent activities. For, throughout the decade of composing the Critiques, Kant was also lecturing regularly on a metaphysical sort of natural theology, writing critical notes on Baumgarten's metaphysics, and offering his more broadly based course on the philosophical theory of religion.</page><page sequence="10">166 JAMES COLLINS There are some unexpected rewards for interrelating these several sources. Considered synoptically, they show Kant's primary aim to be the long range preparation for moral theism and a morally oriented philosophy of religion, rather than simply the destruction of speculative proofs (a goal basically achieved already in his pre-Critique writings). This drive toward positive reconstruction exhibits itself in at least two significant initiatives taken by Kant. First, he distinguishes between the isolated speculative arguments for God's existence and the wider theory of God. Whereas the arguments fail as existential demonstrations, they still serve good philosophical purposes in clarifying the meaning of God. Thus the ontological path has the purifying effect of distinguishing the divine reality from types of perfection found in the world. A service of the cosmological proof is to place high value upon the autonomous existence of God, vis-?-vis all directly experienced existents, even though it cannot furnish the intellectual grounds of assent to the un qualifiedly self-sufficient and transcending existent. And from the physicotheological proof we learn the lesson of always relating our theory of God to mankind's broadest interpretations, especially to that practical search for purpose and order which abides even after Hume's dialectical puzzles are propounded and life's fiercest evils endured. Once the proofs are de existentialized, they can perform these elucidating functions for our idea of God and, taken in conjunction, can propel us to look elsewhere for the philosophical basis of existential assent to God himself. In the same proportion as Kant relates the proofs to the meaning of God, he takes the second step of relating them to the meaning of man in his religious dimensions. Thus the religious attitude of deism corresponds to the ontotheological view of God as the underived all-perfect being, along with the human need for an ideal unifying principle of all speculation. The religious at titude of indeterminate natural theism, or a pious general view of nature, is proportioned both to the cosmotheological path toward an author of nature and to man's need for a global conception of nature and experience. Similar ly, physicotheology expresses the religious attitude of determinate natural theism or piety aroused by the orderly aspects of nature, the notion of an ordering intelligence and architect of nature, and man's need for alliance with and analogous mind which powerfully shapes this world. By this series of increasingly contextualized interpretations of the three arguments, therefore, Kant uses them to clarify not only the meaning of God but also our human intellectual needs and religious responses. Since these functions weld the theory of God with the theory of man, they are among the binding instruments of Kant's philosophy of religion. Yet that they are not</page><page sequence="11">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 167 sufficiently radical interpr?tants of the religious relations between man and God is evident, when we inquire about the moral difference they make in our lives and in our reflections on the meaning of God. The speculative theory of God and its religious attitudinal counterparts do not satisfy our human need for a just and merciful God. Kant thereby relativizes this entire speculative tissue of meanings and inferences toward a common foundation in the prac tical order and the religion of moral theism. (d) Finally, in going from the Doctrine of Elements to that of Method in the first Critique, Kant prepares a bridge to the study of reason's practical in terests. This transition is marked by an increase of conceptual and linguistic caution, but not by any surrender of critical controls. "For although we have to surrender the language of knowledge, we still have sufficient ground to employ, in the presence of the most exacting reason, the quite legitimate language of a firm belief."12 To keep reason honest and exacting when engaged in its practical employment, Kant develops the discipline provided by the canon of pure reason. The essential tool for philosophy of religion is the distinction between opining, knowing, and believing. Just as the pre-Critique texts distinguished between demonstration and conviction, so the critical canon distinguishes conviction itself from mere private persuasion. The crucial difference lies in the ability of conviction to supply grounds of judgment which can be com municated to others, found valid for the mind of others, and hence recognized as binding upon them. Belief steers a middle course between the other two states of conviction: opinion and knowledge. Belief has the subjective suf ficiency lacking in the former, even though in turn it lacks the objective suf ficiency of the speculative sort of knowledge. Thus moral-religious belief is a valid conviction, not to be confused with either opinion or speculative knowledge, let alone with mere private persuasion. Kant makes a further subdivision of three sorts of belief. The varieties of believing experience include: a speculative-doctrinal kind (such as believing in God, in relation to speculative knowledge of the world); a pragmatic practical belief about contingent grounds for taking a particular action as means to an optional, contingent end (a practical but technical or pragmatic imperative); and a moral-practical belief which produces moral certainty through insight into what must be done by all men, under the moral im perative laws of freedom. Kant's philosophy of religion utilizes all three types of belief. Analysis of the speculative theory of of God has shown that we entertain belief in God's existence here in a speculative-doctrinal manner. But this conviction is already rooted in practical interests of man and practical employments of reason, whether contingently in respect to particular creeds,</page><page sequence="12">168 JAMES COLLINS rites, and instruments (pragmatic-practical belief), or universally for reflec ting minds under free moral obligation and religious response (moral prac tical belief). This entire doctrine on kinds of belief generates a movement of critical intelligence to make a specific study of how moral-practical belief is rooted in moral duty and orients people toward a morally grounded religiousness. 3. Religion and "What Ought I to Do?" Our manner of studying and interpreting Kant's ethics is palpably modified by giving attention to the ethics-religion relationship, determined here in terms of four problems. (a) Just as the knowledge question compels us to return to the pre Critique writings for their theistic and religious contributions, so also the question of ethics and religion leads us forward from the Foundation of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785) to the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and the two-part Metaphysics of Morals (1797; The Doctrine of Justice and The Doctrine of Virtue). One reason why we are propelled beyond the familiar Grundlegung is that the laying of a groundwork or foundation is only a part of the task of a critical ethics, as Kant conceives it. But another, supporting reason is that the issue of religion scarcely arises at that initial stage. One cannot see im mediately why Kant should feel obliged, in the practical order, to include some explicit doctrine on religion within his critical scope. This added reach does not become inevitable until one studies his moral and anthropological publications issued subsequent to the Foundation. Not only does the com prehensiveness of ethical theory require this broadening but also the roots and problems of religious theory (including the very vocabulary used in their exposition) depend upon taking a plenary view of ethics. For it is only after Kant makes a few of the perspectival shifts instanced below that the realm of praxis is seen to lead inescapably to a moral religion. (b) An epistemologically basic and yet almost imperceptible shift is made in the Preface to the second Critique, when Kant declares that through the concept of freedom, the ideas of God and immortality gain objective reality and legitimacy and indeed subjective necessity (as a need of pure reason) .... This need is not just a hypothetical one for some arbitrary speculative pur pose, of the kind that one must assume if he wishes to complete the use of reason in speculation; it is rather a need, with the status of a law, to assume that without which an aim cannot be achieved which one ought to set before himself invariably in all his actions.13 Here Kant is reworking the meaning of confirmable reality, with its notes of</page><page sequence="13">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 169 necessity and universality. When a concept gains actional necessity and uni versality through its type of connection with freedom-law-obligation, then it also acquires practical objectivity and reality. That such a conception cannot be employed to reach speculative knowledge does not relegate it either to wishful fantasy or to contingent, particular judgments of prudence. It has a rightful hold upon that kind of objective necessity and universality marking our cognition of practical reality. That the idea of God is included in this class has a repercussion on the speculative theory of God. The speculative concept and theory of God, along with doctrinal belief therein, are now seen to be radicated in the practically real concept and the practical-moral belief in God. The practical objective reality of the idea of God holds an epistemological primacy, reaching backward to sustain the speculative-regulative use of that idea, and looking forward to the need for a distinctively religious qualification and use of the same practically real idea. From our previous dual correlation of speculative paths to God with cor responding needs of man and with types of religious response, we can safely infer that a similar correlation obtains in the ethical order. The moral prac ticality of the idea of God answers to a persistent and pervasive need of reason for a morally just God, not merely a highest speculative ideal or a cosmic shaper. Proportionate to this need is its fulfillment (at least in terms of the Critique of Practical Reason) in the religion of moral theism. The latter is not an afterthought, a storey added on to an already well-constructed religion of speculative theism but, rather, is its foundation and animating source. Speculative arguments for God and their supportive human needs and religious responses perform an important clarifying service, not only for the regulative use of reason in the speculative sciences but also for the practico constitutive use of reason in moral and religious matters. Thus Kant's com plex web of knowledge, or cognition in its several modes and relations, has many more ties involving different perspectives on God and religion than might at first be suspected. (c) What renders the religious aspect of moral philosophy even more plainly visible is the distinction between the ground and the object of the moral will. Just as Kant's main concern in the first Critique is to separate speculative knowledge from invalid speculative claims of knowing reality, so also his primary aim in the Foundation is to differentiate the self-grounding of morality in the obligation of moral law itself from any extraneous appeals to perfection and divine goodness and will. Once this differentiation is made, however, the critical ethicist can advance safely from the question of moral ground to that of moral object of a rational will, without fear of confusing</page><page sequence="14">170 JAMES COLLINS them. He can restore the problem of the moral good and the reconciliation between virtue and the happy life. It is now safe for Kant to reexamine (in the second Critique) the object of the moral will which is usually called "the highest good" (summum bonum). Kantian analysis reveals this to be a complex notion, including within itself "the supreme good" (bonum supremum) or virtue and the worthiness-to-be-happy, and "the whole and perfect good" (bonum consum matum) or the precise proportionment of virtue and worthiness-to-be-happy with actual happiness.14 There is an ordering here, with virtue holding the primacy and determining the proportion of worthiness-to-be-happy with the happy life. Hence although the determining ground of the moral will is the moral law itself as autonomously set and accepted, this will finds its satisfy ing object in the highest good, in the sense of the consummate marriage of virtue and happiness. As this bonum consummatum assumes its legitimate role in Kantian eth ics, it also opens up that ethics to the rational need for God as transcending and harmonizing the determinism of nature with the imperative claim of moral law. If the practical reality of God were prematurely inserted as the basis of morality, it would introduce a deordinate, heteronomizing factor. Practical belief in God is not unqualifiedly destructive of ethical integrity, however, provided only that it comes into play at the proper point in Kantian ethical reasoning, that is, at that phase of the critical investigation where the object of moral law becomes important. For Kant's philosophy of religion, this signifies that religious doctrines and acts are also based on practical moral belief, and that any further role they may fulfill in terms of hope must also be regulated by their moral anchorage. Neither the speculative nor the hope-oriented aspect of religion can autonomize itself or break loose from the central religion of moral theism. Just as "the order of reasons" is paramount in Descartes, so "the order of critical founding and inference" is paramount in Kant's reflections on God and religion. He expresses this ordering both in the rejection of a theological ethics (where the basis of moral duty is located in a command of God) and in the converse acceptance of an ethical theology (where the needs of practical rationality engender belief in God and a moral-religious attitude). Ethical theology and religiousness are legitimated in the same general phase of practical critique which also legitimates moral teleology and pluralized duties, within the encompassing framework of autonomous duty and self imposed law. Hence The Metaphysics of Morals probes into man's perfect and im perfect duties to himself, to other moral agents, and to the various public</page><page sequence="15">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 171 institutions.15 Whenever there is a moral conflict radical enough to involve not just the clash among various duties but the very possibility of acting with free dutifulness in a nonromanticized order of nature, however, men find themsleves properly concerned with God and religious trust. Man's religious teleology is given orderly recognition and development by Kant at this stage of our moral maturation. (d) This gradual verging into the religious sphere can also be traced in the Kantian teaching on moral feeling.16 A three-fold pattern is observable here, similar to that concerning objects of moral will, (i) Negatively, Kant removes from any foundational position the British appeal to a special moral sense or moral feeling. This is done without either disregarding or denigrating the sentiments accompanying man's acceptance of moral duty. Hence (ii) he includes within the right ordering of critical thought not only the broad range of surrounding feelings of sympathy and pity, gratitude and satisfaction, but also, in a unique and primal manner, the incentive of moral feeling of respect for the imperative law within man. This is our typically human response felt for the unconditioned nature of moral law, as we freely accept it as the basis of personal moral conduct in an unyielding natural world. (iii) And once the safeguards of an orderly ethical critique are estab lished, Kant is ready to admit that respect for moral will within us envelops a religious reverence for the just and holy will of God, whose encouraging presence is sensed within the human moral situation. Religious reverence can neither supplant nor undergird the feeling of moral respect, but it does open out a fresh horizon for reaffirming one's respectful motivation by the de manding moral law, including the respect for other men as personal ends. The corpus mysticum of interpersonal moral agents, united under moral law, is symbolized and humanly stabilized by the invisible and visible religious fami ly of men, united under God. 4. Religion and "What May I Hope?" Kant remarks correctly that, as we enter the region of respect and reverence, we are already on the native soil of religion. This means more than that there is always a moral response of reverential feeling toward God as good, just, and morally powerful enough to unite freedom and nature. There are two other implications to be noticed. First, the theme of reverence brings out clearly that the Kantian ethicizing of religion constitutes, at the same time, a humanizing of ethics. Religious beliefs and feelings enable an ethics of pure reason (holding for any derived rational agents under imperatives) to operate realistically in the manner proper to human moral agents and com munities, striving within nature. Second, religious reverence develops itself</page><page sequence="16">172 JAMES COLLINS into precisely those images and symbols of encouragement which mark the critical passage from ought to hope, from recognition of duty to reasonable expectation of being able to carry it out in act and in trust of receiving divine aid. In order to avoid the inhumane excesses of idolatry and fanaticism which historically disfigure mankind's religions, Kant controls his hope-oriented analysis of religion by the general limitations governing the Critique of Judgment}1 The critical philosopher of religion does not try to proliferate the realms of being, beyond those of nature and freedom. Hence his findings are not to be taken as the construction of another ontological realm, which can be known speculatively, but rather as one way of reflectively viewing the search for practical unification of the natural and moral orders. The major tools at his disposal are the human efforts (successes as well as failures) to bridge the two orders, along with the reflective judgment for examining such tries at un ification. The study of esthetic harmonization leads to an interplay of our im agination and reason; the study of purposive judgment leads to the harmony of our systems of mechanism and teleology or shaping purpose. And yet in neither instance are we critically justified in drawing an inference that carries the weight of further ontological knowledge beyond the man-in-nature situa tion, no matter how entrancing the prospects of architectonic reason may be. Why bother, then, to make any other sorties of judgment toward the horizon of further hope? The only critically decisive response is that we must seek for the active basis of mankind's constant efforts to prolong the modalities of art and organic purposiveness into those of history and religion, including religions of revelation. Study of the historical modality produces encouraging but ambivalent results. There are spiral advances of mankind in technological and cultural progress, but every peak of civilization also con tains bitter reminders that culture and morality are neither equivalent nor ex actly proportional.18 Even such a historical manifestation of moral freedom, decisiveness, and sacrifice as the French Revolution also dimmed our moral hopes, through its eventual excesses of terror and tyranny. Along with the ar tistic and historical outcroppings of the humane spirit, therefore, Kant con siders religion from the standpoint of its giving us some further ground of hope. To appreciate why human experience provokes the religious search, Kant's Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone highlights the themes of evil, revelation, and the saving community of men. These arouse specific forms of hope, in the mode of concrete imagery and analogous symbols.19 In this fashion, religious hope contributes its distinctive kinds of practical schematization of the categories of moral freedom, especially those which</page><page sequence="17">KANTS PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 173 give practical schematized meaning to the relational categories of person and interpersonal community. (a) Wherever we turn, we are confronted by particular evils which ex press a more radical evil in man, the individual and the historical social agent.20 Kant brings reflective judgment to bear upon the Biblical story of the Fall. Evil arises because of our complex nature (comprising sensuality, rationality, and personality), and its radical quality comes from a steady dis position to subordinate rational law and personal value to sensuous drives and desires for unmoderated power. Religious hope develops here in the form of a threefold reminder. The deordination is that peculiar sort of disposition which we responsibly choose as free agents; the will to accept the moral law and to order all our values around personality is inextinguishable, opening a prospect of rebirth and painful reform of character; and just as the power of evil displays itself socially, so does religion image forth the Lord of history as helping us to shape communal forces for the good, for interpersonal respect as a social bond of humanity. (b) Kant moves cautiously but firmly on the question of religious revelation.21 He distinguishes four contemporary positions, three of which he rejects. Holbach's unqualified naturalism dissolves the problem of revelation by admitting as real only the totality of nature, and hence by regarding a revelation from the moral, all-sufficient God as meaningless. Voltaire's mere or reductive rationalism limits the total content of religion to the inferences of reason and finds no moral quality in religious creeds and institutions. The reductive supernaturalism of the German university theology faculties either inverts the critical order, by judging morality according to religious traditions (theological ethics), or else removes religious beliefs and codes entirely from philosophical reasoning (fideism). The latter also leaves practical enforce ment to the state authorities (civil religion). Kant himself avoids these extremes through a pure or nonreductive rationalism. He affirms the basis of religion in human practical reason and its needs ? a basis that invites scrutiny by the philosopher of religion. Through his lifelong comparative study of Eastern and Western religions, Kant also discerns the common human recognition of a moral order and power that transcends nature and human societies, a divine power from which the religious person hopes for "something more" {etwas mehr) in the form of a message and an aid against life's evils.22 Kantian philosophy of religion reaches its critical boundary here. This it does by inspecting the widespread religious attitude, by not ruling out in principle the possibility of some un known divine help adapted analogously to the human condition and the pluralism of human groupings, and also by resolutely refusing to permit any</page><page sequence="18">174 JAMES COLLINS foundational acts to flow in either direction between the human moral basis and the specifically revelational principle and institutional churches. Their in tegrity is best preserved by keeping them separate in their radical groupings, even though each can make analogous interpretive use of the other's outlook. As a philosopher of religion, Kant restricts himself to developing an open religious naturality. (c) Keeping strictly within the limits of philosophical reason, Kant nevertheless draws most generously upon the imagery of revealed religions in respect to history.23 The crooked stick of man's historical development does not inspire great confidence that cultural advancements?even those of the Enlightenment, whose freedom of thought and technical skills Kant so highly prized?will lead to the moral betterment and peace of mankind. But the reflective mind is reassured by rethinking historical developments in terms of religious language, which constantly speaks of the city and ecclesial assembly of God, the family and people of God, as being on a march guided by divine providence. These symbolizing thoughts cannot be converted into a speculative-doctrinal theodicy of history. But they do add a quality of hope that men will eventually perceive their moral unity and will devise peaceful means for overcoming physical evils and adjudicating their moral, legal, and political disputes. The religious image of a common Father and a common pilgrimage, guided by God's holy-good-powerful love, gives practical backing to our search for a more humane world. Because this search looms so large in man's practical experience, the question of hope and its religious response belong among Kant's primary philosophical concerns. 5. Religion and the Continuing Question of Man A double conclusion follows from the functional linkage of Kant's theory of religion with his questions on knowledge, morality, and hope. First, since these questions together comprise the program of his critical philosophy, the theory of religion is also an important element in that philosophy. Of increasing significance (as we turn in succeeding essays to the nineteenth-century philosophies of religion) is Kant's second, correlative con clusion: just as the primary critical questions in philosophy converge on man, so do our religious inquiries receive their philosophical focus in the question "What Is Man?" The nineteenth-century philosophers of religion are often motivated by the desire to close the gaps in Kantian analyses. Is it not desirable to have an intellectual intuition, reaching to God's very nature? Is it not best to identify this divine nature with the moral order of the universe, thus overcoming the split between the phenomenal and noumenal worlds through God's ceaseless immanent interweaving? Why not take a stand in the divine ground as the</page><page sequence="19">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 175 prior basis for unifying nature and art, theory and practice? Will not a dialec tical synthesis overcome the contrasts between understanding and reason, history and providence, freedom and necessity, absolute and human spirit? Or on the other hand, why not rest upon experienced facts, scientific laws of evolving nature, and the economic-social forces at work, thus eventually ex cluding the practical need for God and religious imagery?except perhaps as symbols of humanity itself in its natural setting? To these and other suggestions, Kant can only reply stringently that they do constitute abstractly possible alternatives to his religious naturality and humane theism. But he will still regard them methodologically as wishful thinking, which?however dialectically systematized or dramatically proposed?nevertheless fails to do justice to the primary question about man. It is this dogged return to human experience, limits, and hopes which con stitutes Kant's perennial vitality and attractiveness in discussions on religion. Like his metaphysics of natural science and of morals, his theory of religion remains stubbornly a border-discipline. It is always a critical study of the ?berschritt or active transition made reciprocally by men between moral and revealed religion, between the speculative and practical components in a moral-hopeful religion and a revelational faith. Although Kant never aban dons his border-post as a critical philosopher of man's religious tensions, he does permit his admiration to express itself warmly about the religious hones ty and faithfulness of Job, the symbol of mankind's only authentic, practical theodicy. Thus, only the uprightness of the heart, not the merits of one's insights, the sincere and undisguised confessions of one's doubts, and the avoidance of feigned convictions which one does not really feel (especially before God, where dis semblance would never work), these are the qualities which caused the upright man Job to be preferred in the eyes of the divine judge to the pious flatterers.24 Kant finds no warrant in his philosophical wisdom about the world and the modes of human experience for saying either less or more than this, in critical theory of religion. His ever-renewable challenge is worth bearing in mind, as the following essays present the developments in nineteenth-century philosophies of religion. James Collins Saint Louis University NOTES 1.

Zweig (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), Letter to CF. St audiin, May 4,1793, p. 205. In the Logic, Kant makes this succinct comment on the four questions: "The first question is answered by metaphysics, the second by morali ty, the third by religion, and the fourth by anthropology. At bottom, all this could be reckoned to be anthropology, because the first three questions are related to the last" (p. 29). The letter to St?udlin refers more precisely to "moral philosophy" and "philosophy of religion" (p. 205) as the philosophical disciplines dealing respectively with the second and third questions. Taken together, all four questions comprise the field of pure philosophy as a study of man in the world. In his typological analysis, M. Landmann, Philosophical Anthropology (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1974), locates Kant in the transition from religious to rational anthropology (Parts 2 and 3), but underestimates the biological and cultural aspects of Kant's view of man. See below, n. 18. 2. Book 3 of Kant's Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone, revised trans. T. M. Greene and H.H.Hudson, with introductory essays by Greene and J. R. Silber (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1960), is devoted to the ethical commonwealth and the religious Kingdom of God, as basic practical realities having experiential influence upon our view of historical and scientific inquiries. Excellent introductions to Kant's philosophy of religion are given in the essays by Greene and Silber, as well as by L. W. Beck, in his Six Secular Philosophers (New York: Harper, 1960), pp. 61-78. 3. Cf. J. P. Day, "Hope," American Philosophical Quarterly 6 (1969): 89-102 (comparing Aquinas and Hume, Kant and Mill). J. Schwartl?nder's Der Mensch ist Person: Kants Lehre vom Menschen (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1968), pp. 248?61, regards hope as the climax of Kant's personalist theory of man. 4. All of Kant's critical inquiries, in their destructive as well as constructive work, adhere to his premise that "general human interests...remain in the same privileged position as before" (Pure Reason, B. xxxii [Smith, p. 30]), with the added advantage of gaining proper methods for distinguishing, limiting, and interrelating the several kinds of human interest in terms of theoretical knowledge, moral action, and pur posive hope. Kant also maintains that "in the combination of pure speculative with pure practical reason in one cognition [of our highest good], the latter has the primacy, provided that this combination is not contingent and arbitrary but a priori, based on reason itself and thus necessary. . . . Every interest is ultimately practical." Kant, Critique of Practical Reason, trans. L. W. Beck (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), p. 126. 5. The religious portion of Kant's early work is meticulously examined by A. Lamacchia, La filosofia della religione in Kant, vol. 1: Dal dogmatismo teologico al teismo morale (1755?1783) (Bari: Lacaita Editore, 1969), and by Pierre Laberge, La Th?ologie kantienne pr?critique (Ottawa: Editions de l'Universit? Ottawa, 1973). For Kant's context in the German philosophical and literary upsurge in philosophy of religion in the 1780s, see H. Timm, Gott und die Freiheit: Studien zur Religionsphilosophie der Goethezeit, vol. 1: Die Spinozarenaissance (Frankfurt: Klostermann, 1974).

Munitz (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1969), pp. 135-56, Kant had already (1755) offered the cosmological prospect of perpetually perishing worlds, of nature as a self-rejuvenating phoenix in this process, and a religious presentiment of God's powerful presence in all these phases of nature. This religious view of natural order and chaos is the Kantian alter native to Enlightenment naturalism's purely immanent theory of processing and chance in nature, as instanced by L.G. Crocker, Diderot's Chaotic Order: Approach to Synthesis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974). 8. Kant, Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Illustrated by the Dreams of Metaphysics, trans. E. F.

After placating Mendelssohn for the half-jesting style of these reveries on metaphysics, Kant nevertheless holds that, in questions of ultimate causation and human destiny, "it is best to pull off its [metaphysic's] dogmatic dress and treat its pretended insights skeptically .... Here we must decide whether there really are not limitations es tablished by the bounds of our reason, or rather, the bounds of the experience that contains the data for our reason." Letter to Moses Mendelssohn, April 8, 1766 (Zweig, pp. 55, 57). Kant is now rapidly moving toward moral experience and the data it supplies for moral belief and religious conviction. 9.

The ground is prepared in Kant's 1770 Inaugural Dissertation On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World, sees. 10?23 (Kerferd and Walford, pp. 60?81), where the contrast between divine and human, intellectual and sensible, kinds of intuition is elaborated.

Pure Reason, A 85: 117 (Smith, pp. 120-21). In Kant's Dialectic (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1974), J. Bennett is able to treat very briefly of God (pp. 228?57), only because of his reduction of the theory of God to the speculatively proposed proofs of his existence. For recovering Kant's own broader stress on the theory of God, one must read the Ideal of Pure Reason (Pure Reason, A 567-704: 595-732; Smith, pp. 485-570) in conjunction with Kant's comments on Buamgarten's Metaphysica, together with his own lectures and notes on metaphysics, rational theology, and philosophy of religion, as published in Gesammelte Schriften, vols. 17, 18, 19, 23, and 28 (the latter arranges and correlates these vast materials chronologically). The incorporation of the Kantian treatment of theistic proofs within</page><page sequence="22">178 JAMES COLLINS the twofold context of a theory of God and a philosophical theory of religion is central for a cautious study of Kant's Vorlesungen ?ber die philosophische Religionslehre, ed. . . P?litz from D. Rink's notebook (Leipzig: Franz, 1817). This twofold context is discussed by James Collins, The Emergence of Philosophy of Religion (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1967), pp. 99-144. 12. Pure Reason, A 744-45: 772-73 (Smith, p. 597).

L. W. Beck (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1949), pp. 293-305. 13. Kant, Critique of Practical Reason (Beck, pp. 4?5). The expanded practical meaning of objectivity or objective reality is studied by B. Rousset, La Doctrine kan tienne de l'objectivit? (Paris: Vrin, 1967), pp. 491-589 (with pp. 566-74 devoted to its religious mode). On the practico-real postulation of God, see Practical Reason (Beck, pp. 128?36); L. W. Beck's A Commentary on Kant's Critique of Practical Reason (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960), pp. 271?83; and James Collins, God in Modern Philosophy (Chicago: Regnery, 1959), pp. 190?96. 14. Practical Reason (Beck, pp. 114-24). K. Ward, The Development of Kant's View of Ethics (Oxford: Blackwell, 1972), traces the teleological and religious motif throughout Kant's ethical thought, but criticizes him for not moving resolutely from Christian theism to Hegel (pp. 167?68). The theistic-religious core of Kant's view of the highest good and the ends of practical reason also disturbs P. Hutchings, Kant on Absolute Value (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1972), as being subversive of the values of rationality and person (pp. 308?42). Although unable to rebuild Kantian ethics in their own images of Tightness, Ward and Hutchings do testify to the theistic ethico-religious import of Kant's bonum consummatum. 15. The movement from The Metaphysical Elements of Justice: Part I of the Metaphysics of Morals, trans. J. Ladd (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), to The Doctrine of Virtue: Part II of The Metaphysics of Morals, trans M. Gregor (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1964), is toward an ever increasing interiorization and moral liberation of all our duty-motivated actions and relationships, including the duty to oneself of viewing all duties in the light of the moral-religious idea of God (Doctrine of Virtue, Gregor, pp. 161-63). Kant's Lectures on Ethics, trans. L. Infield (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1963), pp. 78-116, follows Baumgarten's older ordering of topics which placed duties to God in a primary, separate position. Kant's own critical reordering of topics in The Metaphysics of Morals constitutes a practical Copernican reversal. A. Wood, Kant's Moral Religion (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1970), accurately represents the critical ethico-religious position. 16. Practical Reason (Beck, pp. 74?92). Respect is bound up with what Kant calls "the categories of freedom," especially those of relation: relation to person, relation to the condition of the person and, reciprocally, relation of one person to the condition of another in interpersonal community (Practical Reason, Beck, pp. 67?69). Cf. . E. Jones, Kant's Principle of Personality (Madison and Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin Press, 1971). J.-L. Bruch, La Philosophie religieuse de Kant (Paris: Aubier, 1968), pp. 157?88. suggests that Kant distinguishes among meanings of the</page><page sequence="23">KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 179 church in order to find fitting symbols of hope for the interpersonal ethical communi ty. 17. These limits are strongly pressed in the introductory and closing sections of Kant, Critique of Judgment, trans. J. Bernard (New York: Haffner, 1951), pp. 3?23, 286?339; and in Kant, First Introduction to the Critique of Judgment, trans. J. Haden (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), pp. 36?45. J. McFarland, Kant's Concept of Teleology (Chicago: Aldine, 1970), follows Kant's lifelong struggle to admit some practical and religious significance to teleological judgments (teleotheology), without converting it into speculative knowledge of divine purposes (physicotheology). 18. This is why Kant himself does not take the Hegel-Marx step into the purely im manentist humanism recommended by L. Goldmann, Immanuel Kant (London: L , 1971), pp. 213-29. Most of Kant's essays on historical modes of progress are gathered in Kant, On History, ed. L. W. Beck (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1963). Against euphoric progressivism, Kant's Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, trans. M. Gregor (the Hague: Nijhoff, 1974), emphasizes our strong passions and their involvement in society and cultural history. 19. In a long, epistemologically nuanced footnote in Religion (Greene-Hudson Silber, pp. 58-59), Kant cautions us that the religious conception of an all-sufficient, loving, and helping God functions, within a critical philosophy of religion, as a "schematism of analogy, with which (as a means of explanation) we cannot dispense. But to transform it into a schematism of objective determination (for the extension of our knowledge) is anthropomorphism, which has, from the moral point of view (in religion), most injurious consequences." Underlying this injunction is Kant's non causal, non-speculatively-inferential notion of analogy. The latter's connective func tion in his philosophy as a whole is inspected by S. Takeda, Kant und das Problem der Analogie (the Hague: Nijhoff, 1969); and its epistemological ground and limits in the first Critique are set forth by A. Melnick, Kant's Analogies of Experience (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973). There is still need for a thorough study of the specifically moral and religious aspects of Kantian analogy. 20.

See Religion (Greene-Hudson-Silber, pp. 142-45); Der Streit der Fakult?ten (Academy Edition, vol. 7), pp. 44?67.
