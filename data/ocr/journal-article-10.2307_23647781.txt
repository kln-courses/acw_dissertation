<plain_text><page sequence="1">Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas USA TREVER I. Introduction In the early seventeenth century, the native Andean author and artist Felipe Guarnan Poma de Ayala penned an illustrated account of the history of Peru from its first inhabitants, through the Inca kings, to his own era of Spanish viceregal rule. Guarnan Poma's history, El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno (ca. 1615), is best known for the 398 line drawings that illuminate the text. No other early colonial Peruvian manuscript is so heavily illustrated and thus Guarnan Poma's pictures have been repeatedly mined for the illustration of Andean history, anthropology, and ethnography. Not until relatively recently, however, have scholars begun to evaluate and contextualize Guarnan Poma's use of European popular and religious iconography, survivals of pre-Hispanic visual traditions, and colonial-era agendas.1 Within Guarnan Poma's corpus, one finds the invention and recombination of pictorial language to serve the rhetorical needs of an often paradoxical writer. The images of the Nueva corónica are just as polemical as its text, especially in their amplification of the author's argument for a return to native rule in Peru, unburdened by both idolatry and corruption, but grounded instead in the Catholic faith. In this essay I examine Guarnan Poma's pictures of native religion within this context of pictorial invention and colonial religious rhetoric. I bring together the artist's illustrations of huacas (central objects of Inca and Andean devotion) in the Nueva corónica with the watercolors that he made years prior to illustrate the same subject for the Spanish friar Martín de Murúa's Historia del origen y genealogía real de los reyes ingas del Pirú (ca. 1590), also known as the Galvin manuscript. Those earlier color drawings have only recently resurfaced in the academic world and they reveal much about Guarnan Poma's graphic production. This study is art historical in its focus on formal shifts and pictorial re-articulations, but its analyses also draw upon recent advances in Andean history, ethnography, and archaeology. This essay will argue that Guarnan Poma invented a new colonial iconography for depicting native Andean religion during his collaboration with Murúa and that he continued to use and adjust that iconography throughout his career. Guarnan Poma's pictorial formulae integrate conventional Christian tropes of idolatry with particular Andean emphases on the sacrality of mountains and stone. It is well known that pagan forms from classical antiquity informed Spanish interpretation of idolatry in the American viceroyalties, and so it is not surprising that Guarnan Poma draws heavily upon medieval iconography of idolatry in these pictures. What is more remarkable is how the illustrator adapts that vocabulary to suit the local subject at hand. In the later Nueva corónica, Guarnan Poma continues to employ the same idiosyncratic iconography of mountains-as-idols, but the formula shifts as he reveals a deeper understanding of the primacy of ancestral cults. Guarnan Poma's most "authentic" visual articulation of pre-Hispanic metaphysics, however, appears not in the Nueva corónica but, unexpectedly, in the illustrated Inca romance that concludes Murúa's Historia. In the change of genre to romantic fiction, Guarnan Poma's pictures are seemingly freed from the constraints of religious rhetoric. What results is a radically different representation of two huacas (Pitusiray and Sahuasiray) in an image of apotheosis that is singular in the history of art. II. Assembling the huacas At the opening of his chapter on idolatry in the Nueva corónica, Guarnan Poma illustrates the fifteenth-century Inca king Topa Inca consulting an assembly of huacas (fig. 1 ).2 "Huaca" is a Quechua and Aymara term that is Several ideas developed here were first presented at the Association for Latin American Art's first triennial conference "Open Dialogues" at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts in October 2007.

In this pen-and-ink illustration, the Inca king speaks with a circle of twelve huacas that vary from vaguely human figures to angular monoliths and a small temple. He says: "Huaca vilcaconal Who among you has said for it not to rain, not to freeze, not to hail? Speak! That is all." Several huacas turn away as they collectively deny his accusations: "It was not us, Inca!"3 At left we see the mountain Huanacauri just outside of Cusco, the capital of the Inca empire. At its summit Guarnan Poma has drawn a small seated figure (Huanacauri huaca) within a shrine.4 From his mountaintop abode, the apical huaca of the Inca kings—also known as Ayar Uchu, the petrified brother of the Inca dynastic founder Manco Capac (Betanzos 1996 [155 7] :pt. 1:4:15—1 6; Sarmiento 2007 [1572]:12:66; Cobo 1979 [1653]:bk. 2:3:104)—watches silently over the assembly. Yet an early colonial account of the huacas of Cusco states that the sacred object revered within the shrine at the top of the mountain Huanacauri was a plain stone: "It was of moderate size, without representational shape, and somewhat tapering. [. . .] After the Spanish arrived, they removed a great quantity of gold and silver from this shrine but paid no attention to the idol, because it was, as I have said, a rough stone" (Cobo 1990 [1653]:bk. 1:15:74 [Co-6:7]).5 Guarnan Poma's anthropomorphic image of Huanacauri is not a faithful description of what the aniconic mountaintop huaca looked like, but rather a conceptual illustration of the huaca personified. With this image Guarnan Poma begins a highly unusual series of colonial pictures of ancient American religion. The term "huaca" eludes easy definition and historically it has been interpreted and constructed in various ways. In general, however, a huaca is a sacred place, person, animal, or thing that is especially imbued with the activating, manna-like force known in Quechua as camay (Salomon 1991, 1998; Taylor 2000:1-17). As an ontological category, huaca may include divinities, celestial bodies, ancestors, ethnic origin places ipacarinas), or personified forms in the landscape, as well as shrines, trees, portable objects, or any thing that is exceptional for its type, such as an egg with two yolks, a person with a cleft lip, or a strangely shaped stone online (Guarnan Poma 2006 [ca. 1615]). A small group of scholars has argued that the Jesuit Bias Valera was the real author of this manuscript (Cantù 2001 ; Laurencich 2007) but the authenticity of the "Naples documents" that support their claim is questionable (Andrien 2008). 3. The Quechua dialogue reads: "Uaca bilcacona! Pim camcunamanta 'ama parachun, cazachun, runtochun' ninqui? Rimari. Chaylla."The huacas respond: "Manam nocacunaca, Ynca" (Guarnan Poma 2006 [ca. 1615]:261 [263]). My translation is adapted from Roland Hamilton's recent English translation (Guarnan Poma 2009 [ca. 16151:201). Guarnan Poma glosses the scene in Spanish: "con todas las uacas habla el Ynga." 4. Masonry ruins of an Inca temple on Huanacauri have been described by Romualdo Aguilar (1913) and John H. Rowe (1944; see also Bauer 1998:108). 5. Bernabe Cobo's list of over 350 huacas (1990 [1653]:ch. 13-16) is thought to be based on Juan Polo Ondegardo's ca. 1559 survey of the shrines of Cusco (Julien 2008). Some other colonial accounts describe the stone idol of Huanacauri as anthropomorphic (such as Betanzos 1996 [1557]:pt. 1:4:15-16; Moliná 1988 [ca. 1576]:77), but I find Cobo's account to be the more reliable physical description.</page><page sequence="3">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 41 (Polo Ondegardo 1982a [1585] :447; Gonzalez Holguín 1901 [16081:123; Garcilaso 1989 [1609]:bk. 2:4:76-77; Rowe 1963 [1946]:295-297; Salomon 1991:16-19). In broad strokes, the concept of huaca does not describe a particular type of thing so much as an extraordinary state of being. But rarely are huacas pictured in colonial Peruvian books or manuscripts and they seem never to have been represented mimetically in earlier Inca art. Only one other set of images even remotely resembles this series: the watercolor illustrations that Guarnan Poma made for Martín de Murúa's Historia del origen y genealogía real de los reyes ingas del Pirú (ca. 1590).6 Considered together, these two series of images make up an exceptional collection of early colonial visualizations of pre-Hispanic religious forms. Guarnan Poma established a precedent for his image of Topa Inca addressing the huacas in a watercolor made for Murúa (fig. 2). In that drawing, the Inca king Capac Yupanqui speaks with a group of huacas in Cusco.

The huacas in Murúa's manuscript illustration vary in shape from plain monoliths to a phallus to anthropomorphic figures. Pacha iachachic, a name for the Inca creator deity,8 is inscribed in Murúa's handwriting across the surfaces of two monolithic huacas.9 Here, as in 6. Two versions of Murúa's illustrated history are known to exist in manuscript form. The earlier manuscript (Murúa 1946 [ca. 1590]; 2004 [ca. 1590]), which is in the private collection of Sean Galvin and discussed here, is dated 1590 on its title page although it was probably completed around 1600 (Adorno and Boserup 2005:177-184). Murúa's later, ca. 1613 manuscript, titled Historia general del Piru (Murúa 2001 [c.1613], 2008 [ca. 1613]), is in the J. Paul Getty Museum (Ms. Ludwig XIII 16). Emilio Mendizábal Losack (1961:254) was the first to suggest that Guarnan Poma illustrated parts of the earlier Galvin manuscript. Indeed, Guarnan Poma created over ninety illustrations for that work (Adorno and Boserup 2005:110), four of which were later removed and bound in the Getty manuscript (ibid.:167-169, 253-254; John H. Rowe identified these insertions in an unpublished 1979 study). Other illustrations in the Getty manuscript were executed by Murúa himself (Cummins n.d.). The Getty manuscript illustrations were never completed and only the earlier Galvin manuscript includes drawings of huacas, all of which are the work of Guarnan Poma. 7. Mercedes López-Baralt (1988:187-267) and Rolena Adorno (2000:89-120) both argue that there is an indigenous system of spatial values found throughout Guarnan Poma's illustrations in the Nueva corónica. They interpret figures placed at the top or left of the page (or, the "conceptual right" if one assumes a perspective internal to the picture) as consistently dominant to those at the bottom or right. They argue that this spatial coding derives from asymmetric duality found in the hanan (greater, upper, right) and hurin (lesser, lower, left) moiety structure in the Andes. Adorno (2000:100) observes that divinities are always drawn to the left of worshippers in the Nueva corónica. In some of Guarnan Poma's illustrations in the Galvin manuscript the divinity is also placed at the left (36v, 39v, 64v), but in most it appears at the right (7v, 95v, 96v, 98v, 99v, 10Ov, 101 v, 102v, 103v, 104v, 105v). I perceive no inversion of value resulting from this compositional reversal. If such a spatial code exists in the Nueva corónica, it is not present in the same way in Murúa's Historia. 8. John H. Rowe(1963 [1946]:293) discusses the full name of the Inca creator deity as llya-tiqsi Wiraqoca Pacayacaciq ("Ancient foundation, lord, instructor of the world"). 9. Both Guarnan Poma and Murúa inscribed the illustrations in the Galvin manuscript, although the images of idolatry were inscribed solely by Murúa (Adorno and Boserup 2005:162-165, 198-199, app. 6).</page><page sequence="4">42 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 the Nueva corónica, Guarnan Poma's picture is didactic in its presentation of Andean divinities as occupying points on a spectrum between lithic and anthropomorphic extremes and it reveals an understanding of some huacas as liminal, mythological beings that could shift from humans into stones and vice versa.10 It is this set of stony huacas in particular that Guarnan Poma emphasizes throughout his drawings of native Andean religion. Although huacas might be any physical objects especially imbued with camay, they are most often described in colonial extirpation accounts as stones, springs, temples, and mountains that had numinous properties, oracular powers, and mythological importance, and were active agents in ancient political conflicts and alignments (Polo Ondegardo 1982a [15851:447; Arriaga 1999 [1621 ]:2:28-31 ; Rowe 1963 [1946]:296; Curatola and Zióíkowski 2008). These huacas are often encountered in landscapes and many of their shrines are arranged along conceptual lines called ceques that radiated out of Cusco (Cobo 1990 [1653]:bk. 1:12-16, 47-84; Zuidema 1964; Rowe 1979; Van de Guchte 1990; Bauer 1998; Christie 2008). Processions to and rituals at these shrines continue to be performed by communities following a religious calendar (Sallnow 1987; Reinhard 2005).11 Inca and other Andean sculptures in metal often represent figures naturalistically but sculptures that survive in stone conform to distinct stylistic and aesthetic canons. Stone huacas were often either uncarved rock formations (fig. 3) or sculpted stones that were abstract or only vaguely figurai in form (Dean 2006a; Paternosto 1996). At times lithic huacas evoked the shapes of humans and animals (Allen 1997:78), but they were rarely fully formed and their identification often required visions and extraordinary acts of perception (Brittenham n.d.). Large stone huacas were often described by Spanish priests as formally ambiguous, monstrous, or malformed, looking almost like a man or a child but not quite (see, for example, Acosta 2002 [1590]:bk. 5:9:270; Arriaga 1999 [1621 ]:10:97; Cobo 1990 [1653]:bk. 1:11:46).12 Even the portable huacas that were considered the "doubles" or "brothers" (huauques) of the Inca kings and deities did not represent their subjects directly but instead took the shapes of birds, fish, or snakes (Van de Guchte 1996; Dean 2006a). Monolithic huacas set in the landscape often echo the forms of mountains beyond and require proper alignment of viewer, stone, and landscape (Dean 2006b; Astuhuamán 2008). Seeing figures in stone huacas was, and remains, part of a process of visual imagination and active engagement between object and viewer. These stone huacas are incommensurate with Western religious sculpture that informed Spanish encounters with native religion in the Americas (see, for example, Cummins 1994, 1995, 2002a; Dean 2006a). In contrast to Renaissance or classical sculpture, Inca and other highland Andean artistic traditions emphasize visual abstraction, metonymy, and materiality over verisimilitude and mimesis. The division between sculpture and nature, between "idol" and rough stone, was not as firmly defined in the pre-Hispanic Andean world as it was in the European tradition. In the text of Guarnan Poma's Nueva corónica, as in most colonial accounts (see Duviols 1977; MacCormack 1991; Mills 1997), however, the author describes huacas simply as "idols." But whereas such glosses fall short in defining the complexity of what the huacas were, Guarnan Poma's images offer richer commentaries on the physical and metaphysical qualities of these Andean religious forms as they are situated within the colonial ideology of the artist's time. Let us turn to Guarnan Poma's earliest pictures of huacas, created for Murua's Historia. 10. Inca and Andean mythology is replete with tales of petrification and lithomorphosis. For example, through divine intervention, stones in the battlefield transformed into soldiers to aid Inca Yupanqui in a pivotal victory against the Chancas (Pachacuti Yamqui 1995 [ca. 1613]:58 [19r]; Cobo 1979 [1653]:bk. 2:10:127-129). After he became king and took the name Pachacuti, the Inca had these stones installed in temples throughout Cusco (Acosta 2002 [1590]:bk. 6:21:364; Cobo 1990 [1653]:bk. 1:8:35-36). 11. Recently historian Peter Gose (2006, 2008) has argued, however, that the worship of mountains, rocks, and stones was not original to pre-Hispanic religion. Rather, he proposes that landscape worship arose only in the aftermath of sixteenth-century reducción and extirpation campaigns that rid communities of the mummified ancestors and sculptural "idols" that formed the original core of Andean worship, leaving only the land itself as the object of devotion. Gose's study is important in its historicization of the forms of native Andean religion. What that author does not analyze critically, however, is the physical form of those Andean "idols," which he seems to accept as anthropomorphic statues in the classical European sense. The "idols" of pre-Hispanic Andean ancestral cults—such as the stone of Huanacauri—were just as likely (or perhaps more likely) to be rough stones as anthropomorphic statues. As such, they maintained a material continuity with the landscape and thus the change that Gose observes may better be understood as a colonial shift in emphasis rather than a complete rupture in religious practice. 12. A possible exception, the purportedly Inca stone statue in the Museo de América, Madrid (Van de Cuchte 1996:fig. 1 ) is in all likelihood a colonial reworking of an original Inca stone.</page><page sequence="5">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 43 i&gt; ' - - ' - -- '^trZ-ixai:^ - ■ ■ £a2H3h£l Figure 3.

Huaca illustrations in Murúa's Historia (ca. 1590) With the recent publication of the earliest known version of Murúa's illustrated history (2004 [ca. 1590]), the corpus of Guarnan Poma's illustrations has increased dramatically. Rediscovered in a private Irish collection by historian Juan Ossio in 1997 (Ossio 1998), Murúa's Historia del origen y genealogía real de los reyes ingas del Pirú is one of only four illustrated manuscripts known from early colonial Peru and it contains over ninety illustrations by the hand of Guarnan Poma.13 Sometime during 1596-1600 Guarnan Poma worked as Murúa's illustrator, but the circumstances are not well known (Adorno and Boserup 2005:187-188, 191-196). Guarnan Poma's own chronicle is modeled closely in places on Murúa's history (Mendizábal Losack 1963; Murra 1992; Ossio 2001 ). The formal relationships between illustrations in Murúa's history and the Nueva corónica are exceptionally close at times and the rediscovery of the former allows for many new insights into the latter. Guarnan Poma's work as Murúa's illustrator was one phase in the long life of a colonial Andean artist and chronicler who described himself as a prince and descendent of native Andean lords. Born sometime between 1535 and 1550, probably in Huamanga, Guarnan Poma has been described as an indio ladino—an Indian who was Christian, spoke Spanish as well as Quechua and other native languages, and who dressed and conducted himself as a Spaniard. In 1569-1570 he assisted the ecclesiastical inspector Cristóbal de Albornoz in the extirpation of native religion in Soras, Lucanas, Laramati, and Lucanas Andamarca (Adorno 2000:xlii—li, 2008:255-257). During these years Albornoz led the repression of the native religious movement Taki Onqoy ("dance of sickness") (Molina 1988 [ca. 15761:129-134; Albornoz 1988 [1581 1585]:192; Duviols 1977:133-142; Gose 2*008:81-117; Millones 1990; Mumford 1998). Guarnan Poma may also have accompanied viceroy Toledo's inspection tour from Huamanga to Cusco, where he spent time in the 1570s (Adorno 2008:256). Guarnan Poma and Murúa both demonstrate considerable familiarity with the texts of the Third Provincial Council of Lima, which was convened by Archbishop Toribio Alfonso de Mogrovejo and held in 1582-1583. Guarnan Poma may even have been in Lima during that time (Adorno 2000:xlviii; Gisbert 1992:76). Most of Murúa's chapters on pre-Hispanic Andean religion in the Historia are copied directly from passages in the "pastoral complements" published in the Council's Confessario para los curas de Indios in 1585.14 In particular, the detailed descriptions of Inca and Andean religion written by the corregidor Juan Polo Ondegardo (1982a [1585], 1982b [1585]) that he used 13. The other three are the Getty manuscript, the Nueva corónica, and Juan de Santa Cruz Rachacuti Yamqui's Relación de antigüedades de este reino del Perú (1995 [ca. 1613]), although the latter contains only three drawings. All four works were completed within twenty-five years by three primary individuals, and they represent a rich, though short-lived, flourishing of manuscript illustration in early colonial Peru. In contrast, manuscript painting thrived in colonial Mexico where artists drew upon long-standing pre-Hispanic traditions of codex illustration (Boone 1998). 14. Juan Ossio (2004:179-202) has documented Murúa's extensive borrowing from these documents in chapters 45-62 of book 3.</page><page sequence="6">44 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 became standard references for the Catholic Church in the 1580s. But whereas Murúa's accounts of Andean religion are canonical, the illustrations are anything but conventional. The images of Andean worship in the Historia begin with a drawing of the Inca king Capac Yupanqui venerating the sun (fol. 95v, see fig. 7), but the manuscript's first image of a huaca is found in the illustration of the Inca captain Apomaita (fol. 39v). Apomaita is depicted removing a green demonic figure (a huaca, according to the text) from the top of a hill or monolith (fig. 4).15 This image of Apomaita with the huaca-as-devil is reminiscent of a woodcut illustrating cannibalism that was published in Pedro de Cieza de León's Parte primera de la chronica del Perú in Seville in 1553 (fig. 5).16 In Cieza's image a winged devil appears on a column while a man cuts into the chest of another and two dead captives hang from ropes. This image of the devil in the New World derives directly from medieval European iconography of idolatry (see Camille 1989; Cummins 2002b). Similar conventions are employed, for example, in a scene of Armenian idolatry from a late-fourteenth-century French illuminated manuscript of Marco Polo's Livre des Merveilles (fig. 6). In that image two men kneel before an anthropomorphic idol that stands upon a column. Throughout his oeuvre, Guarnan Poma demonstrates a broad familiarity with the iconography of European popular images and religious prints and engravings that he recombined to serve new pictorial needs (see, for example, Van de Guchte 1992; Holland 2002; Schenone et al. 1994). Guarnan Poma would have had ample access to prints and illustrated books in Lima and Cusco, for example, in the library of Albornoz, and he might have made a living for some time as a print seller (Van de Guchte 1992:92). Surely he would have been cognizant of this type of medieval image, among many others. But whereas Cieza's woodcut lifts its representation of the devil directly from Christian iconography, Guarnan Poma's drawing &lt;/ i\n1 art ^ - i (ifii1 iQ[ii 'o i /:- • ".o- -&lt;•«&gt; Figure 4.

In the French illumination, the idolaters kneel with a hill behind them, but in Guarnan Poma's drawing the landscape is brought to the fore and incorporated into the representation of the idol itself. The stock image of idolatry is thus modified in Guarnan Poma's picture through the addition of Andean reverence for the sacred landscape. 15. Like Mesoamerican deities (Cervantes 1994), Andean spirits called supay were often interpreted as demons in colonial histories (Duviols 1977:38-41; MacCormack 1991:255-257; Harrison 1989:47 48) and they are often imagined as such in colonial Peruvian paintings and prints (Mesa and Gisbert 1982). Horned and winged supay are frequently depicted in the illustrations in the Nueva corónica, but the demon huaca with Apomaita is the only example in Murúa's ca. 1590 Historia. 16. A different woodcut illustrating this same scene was published in Cieza's 1554 Antwerp edition (1954:19:48). In that image the winged devil stands upon an altar within a curtained temple.</page><page sequence="7">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 45 Figure 5. An incident of cannibalism in Peru. Cieza, Parte primera de la chronica del Perú, 1553, ch. 19, fol. 22. *58 803F, Floughton Library, Harvard University. This iconographie innovation of including the monolith/mountain as a necessary component of the Andean idol recurs throughout the illustrations of huacas in Murúa's Historia (figs. 7-10). Guarnan Poma's drawing of Capac Yupanqui offering sacrifices to the sun (fig. 7), which introduces Murúa's chapters on Andean idolatry, is a fine example. In the text, Murúa describes how the Incas offered sacrifices to the sun and to the creator god Pachayachachic, which he states was represented by a gold statue in the form of a ten-year-old boy.17 But in the image one sees the Inca king and queen offering a child and corn beer to the sun and to a mountain that Murúa has labeled Pachayachachic. The image offers an alternative representation of the Andean creator god not as an anthropomorphic idol, but as a mountain.18 The divine mountain or monolith appears again in the drawing of the Indians of Cusco worshipping the sun and the Inca king, who was understood to be the son of the sun (fig. 8). The text describes how cusqueños would pray to the sun, and then to the Inca, but nowhere Figure 6. Idolaters of "Lesser Armenia" (Armenian Cilicia). Marco Polo, Livre des Merveilles, 1390-1400. The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. MS M.723, fol. 82r. does it mention the monolith that appears behind the king. Rather, the mountain/monolith has become part of the manuscript's graphic shorthand for indicating Andean divinity. By overlapping the body of the king and the monolith, the artist conflates their forms, as if to indicate that they share in the same sacred quality of being. The mountain/monolith motif appears again in the image of the Indians of Cusco worshipping an idol named Sanco Casoa (fig. 9).19The illustration clearly references Christian iconography, as comparison to the French illumination of Armenian idolatry readily reveals (fig. 6); in both illustrations men kneel in a landscape and raise their hands in European-style prayer to the anthropomorphic idol that is elevated at the right of the page.20 But in Guarnan Poma's image the Andean idol is 17. This description of the statue of Pachayachachic (fols. 95r-96v) is a later textual addition in Murúa's hand. 18. Only later in the manuscript (bk. 3, ch. 50) does the text state that huacas often took the forms of rocks, hills, and mountaintops. 19. One presumes that a huaca by this name existed in Cusco, but it is not included in Polo's huaca list (Cobo 1990 [1653]:bk. 1:12—16, 47-84) or in the extirpation accounts produced by Cristobal de Molina (1988 [ca. 1576]), Albornoz (1988 [1581-1585]), or José de Arriaga (1999 [1621]). Rudolfo Cerrón-Palomino (personal communication, 2011 ) suggests that this may be a misspelling of the name of the Inca king Manco Capac. 20. In contrast, typical Andean gestures of worship (mocha) involve placing the left hand on the forehead and extending the right, pulling out eyebrow hairs as offerings, and making kiss-like sounds.</page><page sequence="8">46 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 Figure 7.

Additionally, the drawings depart from the content of the texts they illustrate and it is only through the image inscriptions that Murúa defines these as illustrations of Andean idolatry in the four suyus per se. The quadripartite geographic division of the regional huacas is not found in the accompanying text, although Guarnan Poma will use that format in the Nueva corónica. Murúa's account of native religion continues and contains illustrations of an apacheta (fol. 104v),22 a sacred cave (fol. 105v), and Inca religious specialists (fols. 106v-113v). Guarnan Poma's illustrations of huacas in Murúa's Historia are best comprehended in light of the Catholic iconographie traditions and visual rhetoric that shaped them as well as Polo Ondegardo's mid-sixteenth-century descriptions of native religion. Working closely with the Spanish friar Murúa, whose inscriptions are essential to establishing the content of the images, Guarnan Poma manipulates European conventions for depicting idolatry in order to convey the telluric nature of native Andean religion as described by Polo and understood in early colonial Peru. The images suggest that native Andean religion was defined in particular by reverence for the landscape but that it was also essentially akin to idolatry anywhere else in the pagan world. The iconographie forms and colonial rhetoric of mountain worship established here reappear, and continue to evolve, in Guarnan Poma's Nueva corónica. IV. Huaca illustrations in the Nueva corónica (ca. 1615) Guarnan Poma completed El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno, a nearly 1,200-page illustrated manuscript written to the Spanish king Felipe III, about fifteen years after his collaboration with Murúa. This history, which Guarnan Poma hoped to publish in Spain, consists of three parts: an account of Peru from biblical creation through the Incas, the Spanish conquest of Peru, and a critique of abuses by the church and avww &gt;-7 -A -.7 iv'' W, .C / uLf) '' Figure 11.

Among the author's primary arguments is that from their first age the pre-lnca Indians of Peru were already Christians—he describes them as descendants of Spaniards and of Adam and Noah (pp. 49, 81)—who worshipped the Creator. They later became disoriented and lost sight of God (p. 59). In his illustration of the second age of the Indians, Guarnan Poma depicts a man praying, not to a huaca or an idol, but to an unseen God: "Maker of the World, where are youV'[Pachacamac maypim canqui] (p. 53). Guarnan Poma claims that when the Incas came to power the idolatrous queen Mama Uaco commanded all Indians to worship huacas and turn away from their faith (pp. 81; 182-183 [184-185]), which was restored by the arrival of the Gospels with the Spanish in the 22. An apacheta is a pile of stones or other objects left by travelers at high passes as thanksgiving to the mountains. Carolyn Dean (2006b) has recently interpreted Guarnan Poma's anomalous representation of the apacheta as a stela-like monolith (fol. 104v) as evidence that apachetas also took that physical form. But Guarnan Poma's other illustrations bear no real resemblance to the huacas they illustrate; they are conceptual illustrations, not objective documentation. It is noteworthy that the apacheta illustration includes no numinous figure. One might thus interpret this as signifying that the apacheta was just stone and did not embody the sacred directly as did other huacas.</page><page sequence="11">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 49 Figure 12. The "Intihuatana" at Machu Picchu. Photo: Courtesy of Stephen Trever. 1530s. Central to Guarnan Poma's entire enterprise is the no evidence that the Inca ever placed anthropomorphic argument that native Andeans did not require forcible statues on top of stone sculptures like this. Instead, I conversion—since they were already in fact Christians— propose that Guarnan Poma has represented the huaca and thus the conquest and colonial occupation of Peru here in two ontologically distinct parts: the carved were theologically and politically unjustified (Adorno stone at bottom that is the visible, physical form and 2000:13-35, 60). Guarnan Poma thus calls for a return the figure at top that is the usually unseen, conceptual to native Andean rule that would maintain this original form. What was described earlier as an iconographie Christian faith. shift (that is, the replacement of the column with the For Guarnan Poma, the huacas of the Incas were mountain/monolith) can thus be seen to have had a more theologically equivalent to other pagan idols and profound representational effect in allowing the artist to he continues to employ his iconography of Andean break down the nature of a huaca into its physical and mountain idolatry to make the point visible. The clearest metaphysical components. iconographie parallels between the two works may Elsewhere in the illustrations of the Nueva corónica, be observed in his drawings of Inca rites in the Nueva Guarnan Poma makes similar bottom/top distinctions corónica. In the illustration of the rites of February (p. between the physical/conceptual realities of his 238 [240]), an Inca king offers sacrifices to a small subjects. In an image of an Inca messenger, the artist anthropomorphic figure that stands at the top of a stone has drawn a placard that reads "carta" (letter) above monument. Likewise, the illustration of March depicts a a quipu (an Andean knotted record-keeping device) king offering an alpaca to the numinous figure on top of (p. 202 [204]). Such a placard would never have been a monolith (fig. 11). carried by a messenger. It is present only to explain a The forms of these huacas are distinct from those seen foreign object to the Spanish reader. A similar strategy in Murúa's Historia; it is clear that they are not natural appears in the image of Tupac Amaru being led out of forms in the landscape but instead abstractly carved Vilcabamba in chains (p. 449 [451]). A soldier holds stones. The monolith in the illustration of the rites of a gold idol of the sun, above which appears a similar March bears a remarkable resemblance, for example, to figure within a burst of light. Unlike the stone huacas, the "Intihuatana" atMachu Picchu (fig. 12). But there is this gold idol was an anthropomorphic sculpture</page><page sequence="12">representing the anthropomorphic spirit of the sun. Therefore the physical (lower) and conceptual (upper) forms of the mimetic idol are congruous. Throughout the Nueva corónica Guarnan Poma demonstrates his desire to offer an account that would be understood cross culturally (Adorno 2000:68-71) and these pictorial strategies serve that didactic purpose. The visual differentiation between matter and spirit is grounded in the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas and other medieval theologians, whose distinctions between "substance" (true reality) and "accident" (external appearance) resonated throughout early colonial accounts of religion in the New World and served as the theological foundations for the Catholic doctrine of Transubstantiation (MacCormack 1991). This philosophical distinction between monolith (accident) and numen (substance), which I argue is made visible in Guarnan Poma's huaca illustrations, is not one that is inherent to Andean religious thought. As ethnohistorian Frank Salomon (1991:19) has observed in his analysis of the Quechua myths in the Huarochiri manuscript (ca. 1608), "The world [. . .] does not seem to have been made of two kinds of stuff—matter and spirit—like that of Christians; huacas are made of energized matter, like everything else, and they act within nature, not over and outside it as Western supernaturals do." The bipartite spatial structure that separates the material from the conceptual in Guarnan Poma's pictures is not one that can be explained by Andean metaphysics or asymmetric duality.23 Rather it is expressly dependent on medieval Catholic theology. Thus one finds that Guarnan Poma employs Catholic religious imagination as well as iconography in his efforts to explain the nature of the huacas. Guarnan Poma's cross-cultural illustrations of native religion continue in his chapter on the idols (pp. 261 [2631—286 [288]), which opens with the scene of Topa Inca consulting the huacas (fig. 1 ). Huanacauri appears again in an illustration of the idols of the Incas (p. 264 [266]).24There the mountain huaca is depicted directly below the sun and above the caves of the mountain Tampu T'oqo, from which the Inca dynastic founders emerged (Urton 1990). These distinct places are collapsed into a single mountain form and their condensed image reappears elsewhere as an emblem within a colonial Inca coat of arms (p. 79). w« J £ -j.'V j? 7 Figure 13.

Photo: Courtesy of the Royal Library of Denmark, Copenhagen. The drawing of the huacas of Antisuyu demonstrates greater geographic specificity (fig. 13). Lowland Indians offer sacrifices to three huacas: a jaguar (■otorongo) and the mountains Sahuasiray and Pitusiray. Here the artist has drawn the particular forms of the twin-peaked Pitusiray (pitu: pair or couple) near its neighbor Sahuasiray (see Barham Ode 2007:186 188). He depicts these personified peaks as vaguely anthropomorphic, phallic forms that are reminiscent of the assemblies of huacas consulted by the Inca kings (figs. 1-2). We shall return to these particular mountains of Antisuyu again below. Guarnan Poma continues to adjust his methods for illustrating mountain huacas in a drawing of the huaca of Chinchaysuyu: Pariacaca/Pachacamac (fig. 14). Here Pachacamac is conflated with Pariacaca, 23. See note 6. 24. The huaca Coropuna in Condesuyu is similarly depicted as an anthropomorphic, mountain-top figure (p. 272 [274]).</page><page sequence="13">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 51 Figure 14.

Photo: Courtesy of the Royal Library of Denmark, Copenhagen. the other paramount huaca of the region whose deeds are recorded in the Huarochiri manuscript (1991 [ca. 1608]). Pariacaca is also illustrated in Diego Dávila Briceño's 1570 Mapa de Huarochiri in the Real Academia de la Historia, Madrid. The huaca is depicted in that map as a twin-peaked mountain accessed via a monumental stone stairway. The stairway of Pariacaca is the best known feature of a sanctuary complex that includes a ceremonial road, offering cave (boquerón), mortuary caves, and a sacred rock carved with six protrusions that echo the forms of nearby mountains and represent the twin-peaked Pariacaca and his four brothers (Astuhuamán 1999, 2008; Duviols 1997). In contrast to the Mapa de Huarochiri, Guarnan Poma's drawing does not include any particular details of the shrine complexes of either Pachacamac or Pariacaca. In his image, two Indians offer sacrifices to a crouched figure depicted within the mountain, not above it. That mountain figure is not an ambiguous numen like those seen in Guarnan Poma's other pictures of huacas. Instead, he wears the same headdress as the man who offers a human sacrifice. Furthermore, the mountain figure's shroud and hunched posture suggest that he is a mummy (see Guarnan Poma's chapter of the burials [pp. 287-297 (289-299)]). This figure might reference the funerary caves at the shrine of Pariacaca but, within the context of Guarnan Poma's other pictures of huacas, I suggest that it depicts Pariacaca/Pachacamac himself as an ancestral spirit residing within the mountain. Guarnan Poma illustrates ViIcanota, an important huaca of Collasuyu (Bauer 1998:145-146) in the same manner as Pariacaca/Pachacamac (p. 270 [272]). The figure within this mountain appears as a mummy wearing the headdress that identifies the huaca as ancestral to the Colla Indians. One could also interpret these mountain figures as victims of capac hucha, the Inca rite of sacrificing children at mountain-top shrines (Reinhard 2005) because through capac hucha those offered in sacrifice were understood to become huacas themselves (Salomon 1991:17). What is most significant is that the artist has established a direct, genealogical relationship between the mountain huacas and their devotees. Yet by maintaining the recurring composition of kneeling worshippers offering sacrifices to the elevated huaca, Guarnan Poma continues to code these images of Inca imposed religious practices within Christian iconography of idolatry. In the Nueva corónica, Guarnan Poma adjusts his conventions for illustrating huacas as he seems to struggle with how best to present Andean religion graphically to his Spanish audience. He demonstrates a deeper understanding of Andean beliefs and sacred geography than is evident in his earlier drawings of huacas for Murúa. In particular, the illustrations of huacas as ancestors offer a refreshing perspective that is not found in his text, which denounces huacas as demons and idols and calls for the immediate eradication of their cults. Despite this greater ethnographic sensitivity, Guarnan Poma continues to operate within the framework of Christian iconography and religious imagination. Yet, as this essay's final example demonstrates, when presented with the opportunity to illustrate huacas outside of the context of Christian rhetoric—that is, in an account of an Inca romance in the final pages of Murúa's Historia—Guarnan Poma offers a more nuanced visualization of native Andean metaphysics.</page><page sequence="14">52 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 V. The apotheosis of huacas in Murúa's Inca romance (ca. 1590) Murúa's Historia closes rather unexpectedly with a mythological epilogue of the romance between the Inca princess Chuquillanto and the shepherd Acoytapra (fols. 144r-147v).25 Murúa presents the story, which is illustrated by Guarnan Poma,26 as an authentic Inca tale, although literary features of the Spanish pastoral romance mix freely with elements of Quechua narrative (Dedenbach-Salazar 1990). Parts of the story might have more ancient, pre-lnca origins (Sánchez and Golte 2004). The story begins in the high plains of theYucay valley, not far from Cusco, where a shepherd tends a flock of sacrificial llamas. While he plays his flute two sisters appear. They are both princesses (ñustas) and virgins devoted to the worship of the sun (aellas). The shepherd recognizes them also as the personifications of sacred springs (that is, as huacas). The shepherd and the elder sister Chuquillanto fall in love but the women must return to their palace by nightfall.27 That night Chuquillanto pines for her forbidden love. In a dream a nightingale tells her to sit at the center of the four springs that flow into the palace and sing what she feels in her heart. When she does this the springs respond by singing in unison and she knows that her love will be requited (as illustrated on fols. 144bisv-145bisr). Meanwhile, the shepherd is also lovesick and his diviner mother hatches a plan to reunite the lovers. The next day the girls arrive at the shepherd's hut but he is not to be found. The mother gives them a wooden staff that once belonged to the oracle Pachacamac, within which she has magically hidden the shepherd, and the aellas return to their palace unaware of the contents of the staff they carry. After Chuquillanto falls asleep, Acoytapra emerges from the staff and the couple passionately reunites. But their happiness is short-lived and the next morning they flee the palace with guards in hot pursuit (as illustrated on fol. 147r). As they run toward the mountains the couple turns into stone. More specifically, Murúa writes that they were transformed into the twin peaks of Pitusiray (compare fig. 13) and that one could still see their "statues" between the towns of Calca and Huayllabamba.28 The apotheosis of Chuquillanto and Acoytapra is depicted in the final illustration of Murúa's Historia and it has no precedent or parallel in Guarnan Poma's oeuvre (fig. 15). In the image the lovers' eyes are closed and their bodies are partially transformed, as indicated by the replacement of their lower bodies with stony, blue columns with flanged bases. Petrification as divine retribution for amorous transgressions is a recurring theme in Quechua narratives (Millones et al. 1982) but it is also often found in classical mythology. Murúa's reference to the "statues" (estatuas) of Pitusiray seems colored by Roman myths such as the transformation of Niobe into a stone statue in Ovid's Metamorphoses (Ovid 1958 [a.d. 8]:bk. 6:167-1 72). it is extremely unlikely that figurai statues of the lovers ever existed on the mountain; rather, they are identified with two large pillars of rock on Pitusiray known today as "El Matrimonio" (fig. 3). As befits Inca religious aesthetics of stone, these rock formations only vaguely evoke the figures of the princess and the shepherd. The illustration of the transfigured lovers reveals bipartite and tripartite structures that define relationships between landscape, mythical heroes, and Andean communities. As two parallel columns, the peaks Sahuasiray and Pitusiray/Urconsiray are linked to the princess and the shepherd, and the princess and the shepherd to the towns Huayllabamba and Calca, respectively, all of which Murúa has carefully labeled. The couple appears as a pair of caryatid figures, connecting the mountains above and the towns below. 25. A revised version of this myth appears unillustrated in the later Getty manuscript (bk. 1, ch. 91-92, fols. 214r-218v ). Pilar Alberti Manzanares (1985) has compared the two versions and has shown that many native Andean elements were removed from the later edition. In 1910 Clement Markham published a translation of the romance as "a little fairy tale" (1969 [1910]:App. E:408-414) and Murúa's tale was later included in Luis Valcárcel's Cuentos y leyendas inkas (1939:33 44). 26. All of the illustrations of the romance are by Guarnan Poma with the possible exception of the rendering of the aclla's song (fol. 145bisr), which could have been drawn by Murúa or his scribe. All of the image inscriptions are written by Murúa, with two exceptions (fols. 146v, 147r) where Guarnan Poma's own hand is found (Adorno and Boserup 2005:app. 6:243). 27. The palace (acllahuasi) is illustrated earlier in Murúa's Historia (fol. 94v). Susan Niles (1999:188-194) has studied the remains of late Inca architecture within Huayna Capac's estate in the modern town of Yucay, including the so-called "Palace of Sayri Topa" and "Palace of the Ñusta," one of which could be the palace referred to in Murúa's story. 28. The romance of the mountains Pitusiray and Sahuasiray is recounted in a version of the myth of Sumaq T'ika, the "Princess of the Village without Water" (Dumézil and Duviols 1974; see also Sánchez Garrafa 1992; Barham Ode 2007:101-110; Concha Tupayachi 2006:31-34). The mountains Pitusiray and Sahuasiray are also understood as the paired guardians of maize agriculture and they give their names to the metaphoric couplet of the souls of the plants: pitusira/sawasira (Gose 1994:103-140).</page><page sequence="15">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 53 Figure 15.

The tripartite hierarchy of mountain, mythical person, and town coexists with a bipartite moiety division that remains fundamental to many Andean communities.29 29. The binary hanan/hurin division of Andean moieties is apparent in this image but its layout seems to contradict the spatial interpretations that López-Baralt and Adorno have offered for Guarnan Poma's illustrations (see note 6), since the male (hartan) figure is placed in the position inferior to the female (huriri) figure. In her ethnographic study of Yucay, however, Antoinette Molinié (1996:220) observes a similar reversal in social and geographic structures, such that the lower, feminine moiety (Uray) is understood as superior and to the right of the higher, male moiety ( Wichay). She understands this reversal as typical of Yucay symbolic structures, as contrasted with those of Cusco.</page><page sequence="16">54 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 The princess and the shepherd are identified in the illustration not just with the twin monoliths on Pitusiray, as described in the text, but also separately with the mountains Sahuasiray and Pitusiray/Urconsiray. This image of the cultural landscape is a remarkably early conceptualization of mountains.as the embodiments of gods, heroes, and ancestors that sustain nearby communities (see Bastien 1978; Gose 2006, 2008; Sallnow 1987). In modern Andean narratives, sacred mountains are not static places but are understood in anthropomorphic terms to move around the landscape having affairs and adventures with other mountains, lakes, and streams (see Sikkink and Choque 1999). Guarnan Poma would later allude to the ancestral qualities of mountains and landscapes in his illustrations of Pariacaca/Pbchacamac and Vilcanota in the Nueva corónica (fig. 14), but here the concept is most fully articulated. Yet none of these socio-spatial relationships or metaphysical structures is acknowledged in Murúa's text. The image proves to be the far richer source for conceptualizing stone huacas and mountains as they are situated in the ritual landscape and bound to native communities. It is here, within the pages of an illustrated fiction, that one finds Guarnan Poma's most articulate illustration of huacas. Unlike his pictures of huacas as idols, the image of the apotheosis of Chuquillanto and Acoytapra lacks any identifiable European model. Instead it calls upon Inca and other highland Andean artistic traditions of abstraction and schematic representation, as seen, for example, in pre-Hispanic ceremonial drinking vessels (queros) and textile designs (tocapu) (Cummins 2002a).30 But as elsewhere in Murúa's Historia, the artist does not act alone. Murúa participated in the formulation of this extraordinary image by inscribing the captions that give meaning to its interlocking parts. An image like this was apparently only permissible in Murúa's manuscript and in Guarnan Poma's oeuvre in a fictional context. Here there is no need to maintain the iconographie program of idolatry. Instead, in the illustration of a seemingly innocuous romantic fiction, the artist is freed from extirpation rhetoric and creates an image that offers nuanced insights into native Andean religious imagination and social organization. In Andean religion the maintenance and worship of huacas requires social memory, the performance of oral narratives, and processional movement through the landscape. When narrative is retained and the relationships among huacas, landscapes, and communities are brought to the fore, as they are here, Guarnan Poma's picture of huacas most successfully conveys its subject. VI. Conclusions Guarnan Poma's pictures of huaca worship in the Nueva corónica (ca. 1615) evolved out of his artistic collaboration with Murúa. In that author's ca. 1590 Historia the artist's references to medieval European iconography of idolatry are most direct. Yet even in his earliest images of huacas as idols, Guarnan Poma innovates on standard tropes and his illustrations offer their own colonial commentaries on the nature of native Andean religion in Cusco and the four suyus that augment—and at times contradict—the texts that they illustrate. In the manuscript's romantic epilogue, Guarnan Poma's illustration of the apotheosis of Chuquillanto and Acoytapra offers a unique visualization of Andean metaphysics. The artist continues to expand upon and modify his own iconographie formulae for representing huacas in the Nueva corónica and his pictures offer several important observations on the religious and social meanings of huacas and mountains as ancestors. But nowhere in that later work does he illustrate his subject so fully or freely as he did in the illustration of the lovers as Sahuasiray and Pitusiray at the close of Murúa's Historia. When Guarnan Poma returns to illustrate these same peaks of Antisuyu in the context of Inca religion in the Nueva corónica, the profound knowledge that he previously demonstrated falls away, as if forgotten, and the huacas revert to colonial "idols." Guarnan Poma's agenda to present Inca religion as idolatrous, in contradistinction to the true, monotheistic faith of pre-lnca Andeans, trumps the need to convey more specific knowledge of these sacred mountains in the Nueva corónica. In his polemical letter to the king, Guarnan Poma returns to rely again upon Christian iconography and religious imagination. Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas present an exceptional case study in the history of art for the invention of pictorial forms and the marshalling of images to serve rhetorical and didactic ends within a cross-cultural setting. His illustrations are rich visualizations of religious forms in colonial perspective and they express varying degrees of ethnographic detail 30. The only image that even compares to this illustration in its diagrammatic and hierarchical arrangement of figures in a landscape is Pachacuti Yamqui's drawing of a scene of creation that reportedly hung in the temple of the sun in Cusco (1995 [ca. 1613]:36 [fol. 13v]). Although that image is often interpreted as an Inca cosmogram, Pierre Duviols (1994) has suggested that it is modeled on a Catholic altarpiece.</page><page sequence="17">Trever: Idols, mountains, and metaphysics in Guarnan Poma's pictures of huacas 55 and Christian rhetoric depending on the demands of their ideological contexts. These images constitute neither a linear development of pictorial practices nor a single unfolding of increasing cultural understanding, but rather a complicated, and at times contradictory, path through the artist's often ambivalent attitudes toward the religious traditions of the pre-Hispanic Andean past.
