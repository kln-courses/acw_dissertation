<plain_text><page sequence="1">and yet beneficial in this life, while most of the intervening protagonists are persuaded to mistake sin for virtue. Here Professor Creeth ignores The Conflict of Conscience, for instance, a play much nearer Shakespeare's own time ( 581) and probably, on the evidence of verbal parallels, known to Marlowe. Philologus, the hero of The Conflict of Conscience, renounces his Protestant faith for worldly pleasures in the full knowledge that he is risking damnation. Faustus is rather summarily dismissed as owing little or nothing to the allegorical tradition, primarily because the hero is not tempted by an external figure but is self-deluded and self-determining. This argument isolates dramatic structure from the audience's total understanding of the play. In a sense Mankind was always self- deluded, but in the allegorical plays the internal agents of delusion were exter- nalized and personified. In Faustus it is true that the personifications have become relatively peripheral, that temptation and conflict are presented at least partly in soliloquy rather than in dialogue, but it does not follow that because Othello is tempted by Iago, Othello is like a morality while Faustus is not. Finally, I was not persuaded by the argument that Wager's Enough is as Good as a Feast displays a confused attitude to wealth. There is no real conflict between the theme of the title, which reflects the theme of the play, and the reformed hero's perception that 'this world is but vanitie'. Extremes of asceticism apart, Christianity has traditionally preserved a complex and perhaps ambivalent (rather than confused) attitude to this world, rejecting the Manichaean view that matter is evil, while seeing the world as transitory, mutable, and, in this sense, vain. Nonetheless, it is the work of God and the manifestation of his glory (Romans I. 20), even though the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another. For the morality heroes the conventional attitude to the world was suspicion of its values and moderation in the use of its goods. When Heavenly Man in Wager's plays speaks of loving the world 'in due measure', he is echoing Conscience in The World and the Child and Mercy in Mankind as well as Measure personified in Magnificence. In Medwall's Nature the problem is explored in some detail: Reason introduces Man to the World who gives him clothes and possessions. It is made clear that Man needs the world, and all is well as long as he uses its gifts in accordance with right reason. It is only when he begins to submit to worldly values that he endangers his soul. The strength of Mankynde in Shakespeare, and it is a considerable one, lies in its central analysis of the parallels between the medieval plays and Shakespeare. The weaknesses in its argument spring, perhaps, from a lack of sympathy with the drama of the intervening period. C CATHERINE BELSEY UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, CARDIFF Die Personifikation im Drama Shakespeares. By HEINZ ZIMMERMANN. (Schriftenreihe der deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft West, Neue Folge, 12) Heidelberg: Quelle &amp; Meyer. I975. 260 pp. DM 42.00. In this revised version of his doctoral thesis originally submitted in 1970, Heinz Zimmermann offers a comprehensive study of Shakespeare's use of personification as an important aspect of his dramatic style. His dissertation merits attention because of its sheer scope and the dedication with which its author pursues all the ramifications of the topic. The explication of the aims of the study and the reference to the admittedly large number of scholarly books in which Shakespeare's employment of this rhetorical device has received perfunctory treatment is followed by an attempt at a redefini- tion of 'personification'. Dr Zimmermann sketches the decline in its reputation, 3I6 Reviews</page><page sequence="2">which is related to the devaluation of allegory, to which 'prosopopoeia' is closely linked. He profits from many recent philosophical, historical, and aesthetic considerations, when putting the role of personification in Shakespeare's plays in perspective, by offering a survey of classical, medieval, Renaissance, and modern attitudes towards prosopopoeia, before rounding off his survey with a glance at its use in the pictorial arts and its employment in hybrid art forms in the sixteenth century. A digression on prosopopoeia in pre-Shakespearian English drama, morality plays, and hybrid interludes in particular, and a chapter on its employ- ment in Elizabethan pageantry and masques is supposed to emphasize the appeal and the vitality of this complex technique and the convention on which Shakespeare could draw. Here Dr Zimmermann's indebtedness to fairly recent studies, particu- larly by his chief mentor Professor Werner Habicht, becomes apparent. In the typology of personification offered in the second part of this book, Dr Zimmermann focuses on a first type, that is, the 'fusion of an abstraction with anthropomorphic traits', rather than a second, that is, the 'attribution of human qualities to inanimate objects', and after examining the relatively few well-known examples of the concrete appearance of personified abstractions on the stage in Shakespeare's plays he devotes his attention to the predominantly or even exclu- sively verbal evocation of personifications. (The author deliberately excludes a discussion of representatives of supernatural agents or forces like the witches in Macbeth; the fairies in Midsummer Night's Dream; or Ariel in The Tempest, who has been described as 'the personification of Shakespeare's imagination' by Edward A. Armstrong). In scrutinizing the full range of Shakespeare's allusions, Dr Zimmer- mann succeeds in making the reader aware of the omnipresence of this rhetorical technique, whose importance seems to have been underestimated even by the specialist (compare Caroline Spurgeon's miscalculations, referred to on p. 9). The author offers instructive illustrations for the iconographic resources on which Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists could draw and presents some striking parallels between the characteristic duality to be observed in emblems and the structure of some references by Shakespearian characters, combining 'descriptio et significatio' of certain personifications (see Helena on love in Midsummer Night's Dream, I. I). The numerous plates and some valuable comments in this central section (some of which were clearly suggested by S. C. Chew's substantial studies in this field) support H. Zimmermann's claim that such allusions reminded Shakespeare's audience of pictures they knew and could be exploited for various dramatic purposes. The links between Shakespeare's dramatic art and the role of prosopopoeia in popular forms of drama (for example, moralities with their projection of inner conflicts and their concrete depiction through personifications) seem to have been more tenuous, except in the later plays, as is suggested by Shake- speare's predominantly parodistic use of time-worn devices like temptation scenes (see Gobbo's soliloquy in Merchant of Venice, I. 2). Dr Zimmermann surveys the various verbal and visual techniques through which personified abstraction is achieved. He touches occasionally upon more controversial questions arising, for example, from the use of certain emblematic stage props by Richard II, Falstaff, and Shylock in decisive situations, arguing that the temporary identification achieved through the reference to iconographic conventions reveals certain facets of these characters and clarifies their position vis-a-vis important thematic concerns. He later examines as variants dynamic ways through which prosopopoeia is created or evoked (through an apostrophe by a dramatic figure, in a quasi-dialogue, through stage business etc.), before he analyses the second major type of personification: the attribution of human qualities to inanimate objects. While focusing his attention on certain examples (selected from abundant evidence, particularly in the history plays) of the tendency Reviews 3I7</page><page sequence="3">to personify castles, cities, countries, etc., Dr Zimmermann does not ignore the complex system of correspondences within the Elizabethan world picture which clearly facilitated such imaginative processes and the use of prosopopoeia. Part nI of his book systematically explores the diverse use Shakespeare made of personification and, following the incidental appreciative comments on its function in the central section, illuminates its employment for purposes of characterization. Dr Zimmermann plausibly maintains, for example, that Richard II's increased tendency to use personification reflects a growing loss of his grip on reality, and that Hotspur's constant association with personified ambition illustrates his relationship towards a major theme of the history play, while the persistent use of prosopopoeia in Titus Andronicus and King Lear is indicative of the madness of the protagonists. Though Dr Zimmermann traces a development towards a more organic use of personification in his comparison of the two later plays, he wisely abstains from positing a straightforward evolution in the use of this device and, instead, argues that differing ideals of style determine the quality of the employ- ment of the convention. This conviction is further clarified when Dr Zimmermann establishes the various ways in which thematic concerns are underlined by and through personification, as for instance in the emblematic exposition in Timon of Athens, or in the frequent appearance of prosopopoeia in the romances, which hark back to the hybrid moralities and interludes. (This can be noted in the archaic fashion of Time's appearance in the framework of the Winter's Tale, and in reminiscences of an allegorical frame in Pericles which were present in earlier plays like Romeo and Juliet.) Finally Dr Zimmermann describes the dramatic value of this rhetorical device, which enables the dramatist either to summarize and reveal universal meaning, or to accentuate moments of intense emotion. It also assists Shakespeare's characters in attempted acts of persuasion and this, inciden- tally, is one of the purposes for which rhetorical manuals recommended the use of the device. The author finally does not fail to observe the contribution of prosopo- poeia to the heightening of narrative passages or monologues. Dr Zimmermann's study observes high standards of accuracy in the text and in the numerous notes (more than 66o), bearing witness to the author's familiarity with recent Shakespeare scholarship, which stands him in good stead and secures the overall success of his study. True, the reader may occasionally wish for a more detailed discussion of examples which are tucked away in the footnotes, and might like to qualify some of the statements. He may, for instance, regret that the author does not speculate more extensively on the function of the several personifications in Measurefor Measure, whose assessment might affect the evaluation of this problem play. (Incidentally M. C. Bradbrook's article on 'Authority, Truth and Justice in Measurefor Measure', RES, 17 (I94 ), is not included in the bibliography or usedin the thesis). There are other minor omissions in the bibliography, sometimes of studies mentioned in the footnotes (for example, books by D. Mehl and by Sister Miriam Joseph are not entered on p. 250). Lausberg's Handbuch der Rhetorik might have been included, as possibly also L. A. Sonnino's useful Handbook to i6th Century Rhetoric. There are, in addition, a number of printing errors (roughly a dozen have been discovered by the reviewer), but these flaws do not detract from the value of this book. Some of the plates might have deserved a more extensive commentary, for example, plate I8 in the context of the link between Sloth and Falstaff. The enjoyment of the neatly presented book cannot be marred by such minor imper- fections or by occasional stylistic lapses into bookishness and overprecision, under- standable in a thesis, but the student would certainly have appreciated an additional index listing those passages from Shakespeare's plays which are analysed in Dr Zimmermann's erudite study. .
