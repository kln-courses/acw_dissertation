<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAUCER'S SQUIRE'S TALE: ANIMAL DISCOURSE, WOMEN, AND SUBJECTIVITY by Lesley Kordecki The view that the connection of women with nature should sim ply be set aside as a relic of the past assumes that the task for both women and men is now that of becoming simply, unproblemati cally, and fully human. But this takes as unproblematic what is not unproblematic, the concept of the human itself, which has in turn been constructed in the framework of exclusion, denial, and den igration of the feminine sphere, the natural sphere, and the sphere associated with subsistence.1 Val Plumwood I believe that the construction of what we call human subjectivity has a great deal to do with the early storytellers in our language and how they built a sense of human-ness in tales that set the male narrator up against the female human and the animal. Today our often solipsistic and arbi trary view of consciousness is being challenged by various ideologies, not the least of which are feminism and anti-speciesism. We might very well gain a better understanding of our past and future paths by examining, as this essay attempts, how the construct of human subjectivity evolved through language, especially that of the first influential writers of English. With the Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer moves from the psycho logical schema inherent in dream visions to the overtly representational, dramatic genre (s) of the story within the story, and this move affects the experimentation that Chaucer conducts with voice, most interestingly, with the voice of the nonhuman. And with the Squire's Tale, we enter into romance, the highly self-conscious accounting of the "other" world, the exotic world, with its social dimensions intact and valuative. The genre of romance demands a more externalized perspective than the highly psy chological dream vision with its internal self-conscious obsession. Similar to travel accounts, the Squire's Tale makes blatant the oriental other, the THE CHAUCER REVIEW, Vol. 36, No. 3, 2002. Copyright ? 2002 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA</page><page sequence="2">278 THE CHAUCER REVIEW magical other, the fantastical other, the feminine other, and the animal other?all associated in a discourse that skirts the perimeter of mas culinist subjectivity, a verbal enterprise exploring these marginal voices. I argue that the animals who dominate the story told by the pilgrim Squire reveal Chaucer's own mediated strategies of language and bring us closer to seeing why this particular tale serves a powerful purpose in the collection. Although the Squire's Tale partakes of romance, mimics travel accounts in its beginning, and enacts a surrealistic dream vision in Canacee's walk through the garden, the source that drives the tale is Chaucer's readily accessible subtext, the mythography of Ovid. The Metamorphoses may well have been a favorite of Chaucer for its combina tion of love and transformation, its ability to melt the frames of a frame story as fluidly as it dissolves the metaphysical limits of species. Here, horse can become eagle and woman can become falcon (or the other way around) in a world where distinctions between creatures seem less insurmountable than the obstacles to courtly love. The tale is one of transformation, magic in its mythic forms, and the prominent perfor mance of animal discourse in the long lament of the falcon unites the exotic other, specifically here the nonhuman other, with the feminized world of romance and the gendered magic that critics have come to see in the tale. Chaucer, like many writers before and after, could not resist shapeshift ing, from its minor form of disguise to the all-out metamorphoses found in Dorigen's rocks and the Canon's Yeoman's coals. Most intriguing remain the tales of humans becoming nonhumans, and what this trans formation means, especially for discourse and storytelling. The many myths of mortals and immortals turning into plants and animals in Ovid attest to the slipperiness of species, a sliding of signifiers that Chaucer exploits in the tale of the lamenting falcon. Women in myth often seem compelled to change their essence as a result of men's desires, sometimes even to extremes. Like the feminized world of nature, the Squire's fal con becomes a haven for the rejected female, as we see woman become bird in a shadowland of otherness surviving finally only through the voice of discontent. The metamorphoses inherent in the two animals of the Squires Tale, the horse who is both magic carpet and eagle, and the falcon who is courtly romance's abandoned lady, have very different effects on the text. The horse, a symbol of manipulated animality, in its silent servility remains a standard detail in masculine magic and masculine subjectivity. The falcon, with its almost mystical articulation, breaks into the set vision, draws out the heroine instead of the hero, and moves the narrative into far more exotic and dangerous sensibilities, largely by the power of the talking animal.</page><page sequence="3">LESLEY KORDECKI 279 A reading of the nonhuman discourse of this tale is dependent upon its strange aborted ending, peculiar even for Chaucer, a writer who often surprises us with his conclusions or lack thereof, for it presents an abstract of a promised text. And although the rest of the story may well involve further magic, the projection of things to come presages a manly narra tion, filled with "aventures and of batailles" (F 659).2 We leave the sus tained voice of myth and magic, the slow pacing of lament and feminized erotic, and clearly get back to the human, specifically to the heroes. My essay considers how Chaucer's masculine subjectivity enters into femi nized animal subjectivity in this reshaped myth, how nonhuman dis course and authorial glossing intertwine with magic, and why the experiment must inevitably fail. The Squire's Tale is a curious locus for an analytical look at the Can terbury Tales: an obscure narrative, an anomaly, unfinished, a lesser tale, concerned with the unimportant (the bird), and curtailed before the important (the human story of heroism and incest) can take place. Like Beowulf, the tale positions the monsters too much at center, and the crit ics who prioritize human history complain. But the two animals defining the story, the brass horse and the talking falcon, have difficulty attaining or subsiding into animal status. The horse is objectified, static, unalive until controlled by a man (with a handy pin in its ear). The dolorous fal con, an exaggerated portrait of a rejected demoiselle, refuses to act the part of animal. She complains to Canacee and then allows herself to be caged, compliantly enacting the primary animal trope in the Canterbury Tales: the despair of the caged creature. The falcon deceived by her lover parodies what happens after the formel eagle of the Parliament of Fowls is forced to choose at the end of another year, the happily ever after gone awry, the "Into the Woods" theme that deconstructs fairy tale as the woods have their own say, or as in this tale, as another bird tells it like it is. This collection of tales has often been considered a demonstration of subjectivity in the making, for in the Canterbury Tales, the question of sub jectivity becomes more complex in the poem's use of multiple narrators and levels of interaction among characters. No longer is the persona mus ing to himself about his enigmatic dream-visions; now we have the autho rial Chaucer diffused through the highly critiqued pilgrim Chaucer and each pilgrim narrator, in this instance, the Squire. But like the House of Fame and the Parliament of Fowls, the Canterbury Tales also develops mas culine subjectivity through internal authorial glossing and animal speak ers. The individual pilgrim tale tellers provide another dimension, but do not significantly alter Chaucer's strategies. And the Squire is com municating to others through romance, a narrative mode that distin guishes itself in its normative review of human history and human possibility. In other words, this particular romance highlights societal</page><page sequence="4">280 THE CHAUCER REVIEW institutions like monarchy and marriage, and glamorizes the Squire's own future career, but it also strays, like Canacee, into another realm, and divergent critical comments about the tale, as we shall see, reveal its spe cial status as experiment. Peter Haidu credits Louis Althusser for our modern notion of subjec tivity, by "establishing ideology as the link between subjectivity and the various institutions of the state."3 But with our absorption in our own human constructs, we often neglect to notice the appropriation of the nonhuman other into our ideological equations. If the subject and sub jectivity are ideologically constructed, with the individual distancing itself from society, then the concept of nature seems oddly outside the dis cussion, which apparently allows only other humans as agents in our self construction. Haidu asserts that medieval peasants "knew no ideological subjugation" being dominated by the violence of both nature and knight hood.4 But surely this configuration, this definition (patriarchy's not Haidu's) of our relationship with nature demonstrates an ideological stance precipitated upon the individual's alienation from the nonhuman, and it behooves us to examine how the perception of the nonhuman helps to construct this illusorily separate and separated human. For writ ers, as I hope to show in this small example, carve out a subjectivity in the midst of not only other humans, but also nonhumans. Critics emphasize the experimentation with voice in the greater poem,5 and this self-construction involves how the pilgrims use words, and to whom (and to what) they assign words in their stories.6 In his role as com piler of story,7 Chaucer creates authors; the pilgrims are mini-authors with mini-subjectivities always filtered through the greater authorial con trol of Chaucer, pointing up his true experiment in subjectivity, voice, and originality. But this narrator layering does not negate current postmodernist def initions of subjectivity.8 Thus the subjectivity of Chaucer controlling the ideological positions of his characters is a dream as ephemeral as the his torical author controlling his own position. All subjects are just that, 'sub jected to their culture, but the ruptures in the text in which the writer challenges these constructs concern the critic, and the moments in which Chaucer's text challenges the construction of a human identity apart from a nonhuman one concern us here. Chaucer's storytelling contest cannot be more directive in its demands, making moves that show the writer at work. The game will be won by the pilgrim telling the tale with the "best sentence and moost solaas" (F 798), dual criteria which fall neatly in line with ancient precepts of instruction and delight. But among the many curious things about this collection of tales, we discover at the end, or the end as we have it, that the contest is forgotten and the pilgrimage itself is finally prioritized with the Parson's</page><page sequence="5">LESLEY KORDECKI 281 sermon and even, perhaps most especially, with the Retraction that dis claims so much of the production. How can we tell the wheat from the chaff, the central from the peripheral, and is the central the instructional, as the end of the poem implies? And does it, like the dominant mascu line subjective point of view, control the voices of others, the chaff of Ac tive discourse? A new locus for the construction of human subjectivity, I believe, is the relatively undiscovered territory of talking animals. Part of the attraction to this tale, part of its solaas, is its willingness to project a different kind of relationship with the nonhuman.9 In this romance, we play with a world less rigidly delimited, less patriarchally defined, a world where magic disrupts the perceived and culturally condoned "natural" and the human once again undergoes reconstitution. Mikhail Bakhtin writes that in addition to a revamping of time, romance as a genre also gives us "oriental and fairy-tale motifs that are ultimately linked to the issue of identity: enchantments of every sort, which temporarily take a man out of the ordinary course of events and transport him to a strange world."10 Magical fairy-tale motifs become "linked to the issue of identity" by various means, one of which is the undermining of set precepts about animals. The use of "man" in this translation is particularly apt, for the romance nearly always has a mas culine hero hammering out his identity. Susan Crane, in her study of gen der in Chaucer's romances, concludes that "the handling of gender marked traits in romance suggests to me that the 'fully human ideal' is finally masculine." She contends that "The ideological demand that a knight or aspirant to knighthood achieve an independent, self-contained, heterosexual identity generates courtships that figure identity as a process of alienation from woman, the foreign, the animal; all that can be made exterior to masculinity marks off where it is to be found. Identity is thus purchased at the cost of isolation and diminishment."11 We see the woman aligned with the animal as other, and in the Squire's Tale, the other moves into the realm of magic, a locus where talking animals are doubly comfortable, because of their freedom of voice and now because they represent the out-of-the-ordinary. In a sense, Chaucer's dream visions of talking animals involve a magical suspension of natural law, but the genre of romance takes this suspension one step further. The tale begins with a stylized idealization of the oriental king, Cambyuskan, with the reader understanding that he "lakked noght that longeth to a kyng" (16). His wife and two sons are perfunctorily men tioned, but Canacee's beauty inspires an authorial intrusion and dis claimer "It lyth nat in my tonge, n'yn my konnyng; / I dar nat undertake so heigh a thyng" (35-36). Language fails the Squire? In this tale in which he assigns the most language to a bird, he cannot muster words sufficient to express the chief asset of the heroine. This failure is significant, since</page><page sequence="6">282 THE CHAUCER REVIEW he is the only declared poet of the pilgrimage, according to the Prologue}2 Derek PearsalTs analysis of this pilgrim presents a picture of the youngest pilgrim, whose "nervous, apologetic tone" somehow allows the recitation of the falcon to adroitly combine "classical allusion (548), rhetorical cor rectio (549), scriptural reference (550, 555), proverbs and texts (537, 602, 608)" which recall to the reader the complex discourse of Chanticleer and Pertelote. But Pearsall also believes that "Someone is taking quiet plea sure in the incongruous juxtaposition of animal and human, and it is not the Squire." And his judgment of the Squire is worded in such a way as to unite man and animal: "The Squire's intellect... is limited: he is curious about things, like any other young animal, about magic and the super natural, but he has the non-intellectual's distaste for things that cannot be neatly explained."13 I think the Squire's performance is far too calcu lating to be summed up as a limiting perspective. Readers of this tale often respond negatively to its peculiarities of romance and lament, with inter laced magical happenings, in a story that does not have a traditional end, but its oddities fall into a specific pattern of writerly challenge. Chaucer tests whether the magic of animals can expand his subjective voice. The action takes place on the Ides of March, interestingly close to the springtime opening of the General Prologue. Also reminiscent of those famous first lines is the description of the awakening natural world: Phebus the sonne ful joly was and cleer, Ful lusty was the weder and benigne, For which the foweles, agayn the sonne sheene, What for the sesoun and the yonge grene, Ful loude songen hire affecciouns. Hem semed han geten hem protecciouns Agayn the swerd of wynter, keene and coold. (48, 52-57) But this time the "smale foweles" that "maken melodye" (A 9) of the General Prologue take center stage along with Phebus, the god of the sun, music, and poetry. This clustering of images, combining bird song and Phebus, later in the collection proves fatal, as we see in the Manciple's Tale. Here the text calls attention to nature, not in the hetero-normative, generative sense of the collection's beginning that Carolyn Dinshaw points out,14 but in a curious avian discourse ("Ful loude songen") directed successfully against the ravages of winter. Both Phebus (his sun shine and poetry) and the birds' song transform the world. We find out shortly that this is not a world in which we live, but one expanded not only by the elasticity, but also by the feminization of magic.</page><page sequence="7">LESLEY KORDECKI 283 Susan Crane sees magic in romance as manifested in both masculine and feminine modes. The magical gifts presented to Cambyuskan seem to partake initially of the masculine kind of magic. The sword, mirror, brass horse, and ring all seem to fall into Crane's category of "clerkly magic" that "resembles applied science in attempting to control the nat ural world and extend human capabilities."15 They all constitute cheat ing gadgets given from one man to another for worldly gain. They can make a man more than a man, extend his self-definition in awe-inspiring ways. The Squire would find these objects most attractive as we see him perhaps imagining himself in the role of the mysterious knight riding into the palace of the great Khan (read Arthur), presenting him with this knowledge and power, and then later dancing with the indescribably beautiful Canacee (277). This tableau presents a fine chivalric fantasy. The holder of these objects can kill or heal on impulse, see through any other's deception, fly through the air to any place desired, and finally, possess the language of nature and learn its healing powers. The gifts are announced by a fastidiously precise narrator, especially in light of his tongue-tied occupatio regarding Cambyuskan's feast, once again foregoing narrative in a glossing procedure that calls attention to lack of language. For the strange knight, in a "manly voys" said his message After the forme used in his langage, Withouten vice of silable or of lettre; And for his tale sholde seme the bettre, Accordant to his wordes was his cheere, As techeth art of speche hem that it leere. Al be that I kan nat sowne his stile, Ne kan nat clymben over so heigh a style, Yet seye I this, as to commune entente: Thus muche amounteth al that evere he mente, If it so be that I have it in mynde. (100-09) The Squire purposely stresses rhetoric here. The knight's speech consists of fifty-seven lines describing the features of his four gifts, the longest speech in the first part of the tale, but a decidedly poor showing in light of the one hundred and thirty lines of the falcon's lament in Part Two. The address contains the tricky language of magic, not how to effect it, but the fantastical existence of it, moving the Squire to preface his retelling in such a specific way, down to what looks like a reference to for eign language, an enhancement of the otherliness of his performance.16 The Squire returns to the question of language this time to highlight the oriental, the exotic, while at the same time reinforcing the traditional,</page><page sequence="8">284 THE CHAUCER REVIEW in the implied analogy to Arthur's court and a knight on horseback lodg ing an appeal during a feast. We see an expansion of the self, an attempt at novel subjectivity (entertaining the oriental other), which prefigures the more radical experimentation to come. We find that this knight vies with Gawain in eloquence (94-97), and this strange, unfinished tale that begins with so many things, gadgets, products of craft, not nature, ends (in so far as we have an ending) with words and human sorrow. One of the bargaining chips, the horse, blends the natural with the artificial in that this device becomes alive, unlike the other remaining gifts, the sword, mirror, and ring whose power is more passive. Their essence does not change, but instead changes those around them. The horse becomes something else, an example of the great metamorphos ing theme of myth which this tale exploits here and in the character of the falcon. The brass horse can not only carry its rider anywhere in a day; it can do so by soaring in the air like an eagle (123), a significant simile for Chaucer's audience familiar with his House of Fame, for the eagle rep resents both wisdom and parody, a wise-cracking corrective for overblown human subjectivity, a nonhuman carrier of the scheming human going about his petty concerns. Although all four presents are remarkable, more remarks are made about the horse, as the Squire punctuates the knight's explanation with far greater discourse upon the strange steed than on the other three gifts. In his hyperbole, the Squire contends that "Nature ne art ne koude hym nat amende" (197), stressing the combined essence of this creature, bridging the god-made and human-made world. For "It was a fairye" (201) that instigates further discourse by the crowds that "murmureden as dooth a swarm of been" (204) and begin to rehearse "olde poetries" (206) about mythological mounts like Pegasus and the Trojan horse. The brass steed, then, becomes a cause for more speech, an object of dis course as well as magic, and an excuse for mythological allusions. The Prima Pars of the Squires Tale ends not with dancing (human danc ing, that is), but with the dance and disappearance of the brass horse, which is returned to after the scenes of royal celebration and courtly plea sure. The trick pin in the ear of the horse rounds off the section of the tale, as the knight reveals the secret of control over the magic animal to the king, control over both machine and creature, the patriarchal indi cation of progress, in an economy of power. The second part of the tale, with its initial authorial glossing on sleep and drink, and its reference to "dremes" (357), sets the reader up for a dream vision that does not occur. Instead, we follow Canacee, who now takes a primary position in the narrative. The earlier section hints at this transfer of focus, with two of the presents, the mirror and the ring, being reassigned to the daughter of the king, and the knight's reward of Canacee's</page><page sequence="9">LESLEY KORDECKI 285 attentions during the dance being granted. But now the speechless, mar ginal icon, the beautiful princess who would need a mirror to consider her ineffable loveliness (consider the mermaid's seductive use of the mir ror) as well as the fidelity of her suitors, not to mention her own identity, assumes centrality in this demonstration of gift number two, the magical ring that translates the power of animals and plants. The tale shifts from masculine speech to feminine, from romance to lament.17 It also shifts from human-controlled animals (the horse) to the birds in the wild, speaking their own tongue. More important for our purposes, the genre switch indicates a shift in subjective sensibilities; the Squire goes out on a limb with his talking bird, and enters a world whose access seems gained by the feminine (Canacee) and whose dimensions are limited by the literary, mythological feminine (the romance-based abandoned woman represented by the falcon). In Canacee's waking dream,18 she emerges from the human edifice of palace into a park, a stronghold of nature and wildness. When she under stands the speech of birds, the Squire pauses in his story to emphasize the coming of the main point of his story. His odd discursive punctua tion occurs directly before she encounters the falcon: The knotte why that every tale is toold, If it be taried til that lust be coold Of hem that han it after herkned yoore, The savour passe th ever lenger the moore, For fulsomnesse of his prolixitee; And by the same resoun, thynketh me, I sholde to the knotte condescende, And maken of hir walkyng soone an ende. (401-08) This passage of authorial glossing reflects typical Chaucerian narrative charm. He worries about the reception of the strange story at hand, makes a joke at his own expense about prolixity, and calls attention to the manipulation of his own narrative ("maken of hir walkyng soone an ende"). This gloss reinforces the text's concerns about speech and recep tion, preparing us for the "knotte" of the whole story. With the appearance of the "faucon peregryn" (428), the Squire intro duces a traveller of a very different sort to the Canterbury pilgrimage. This pilgrim from a "fremde land" (429) epitomizes the foreign "other" for the young narrator exhorted initially to speak of love (2). Another mini-author is introduced, another perspective to consider. The Squire crosses species as well as gender boundaries in his attempt to represent the bird's predicament. Her gender and bodily abuse are addressed by</page><page sequence="10">286 THE CHAUCER REVIEW Susan Crane, who persuasively argues Chaucer's adaptations of his sources. Both Boethius and the Roman de la Rose provide models for the lament of the rejected falcon and her perfidious lover. But, interestingly, we see a merging of bird and woman, which becomes a commonplace in Chaucerian texts.19 We now have the lament of Dido from the House of Fame converging with the animal speaker (there, an eagle), but without the monstrous result that Fame becomes in that poem.20 Here the text attempts to unite the foreign discourse of animal and woman in an envi ronment designed to accommodate it?the exotic east, where magic moves outside masculine control, now under the influence of the romance-defined patriarchal fantasies of love. Indeed, the falcon does not tell her tale until she is comforted in the lap of Canacee, a sexualized iconography akin to the union of the virgin and unicorn. This feminized world of women embracing, complaining of men's betrayal, forms a star tling tableau for the lusty young Squire, a scene with alien sympathies. Kathryn L. Lynch believes that the orientalism of the tale is used to express "an excess of female sexual power" aligning female with the east because of its animalistic and threateningly feminine nature, seen as "monstrous, mysterious, exotic, sensual, sexually deviant." She reminds us that in the popular story of Shahrazad, who tells tales to save her life, "Misbehaving women . . . are not killed; they are transformed into vari ous animals"21 much like the dolorous falcon in this story. But the bird's lament, like all female lament and oriental deviancy, is silenced in a strange way in this tale, for the tragedy is not resolved. The end of the episode is inconclusive, passive, with bird and woman powerless to redress the injustice. This very helplessness alerts the reader to the eventual aban donment of feminine voice as well as feminized bird, for the story takes a very different turn before being interrupted. Behind both the magical horse and magically eloquent falcon lies the mythic theme of metamorphosis, that sought-after chance for an entirely new essence, a break from the world as men have fashioned it, and an entry into otherness. Magic is easily granted and rarely acknowledged in dream visions in which the world of the mind enjoys few restrictions. The magic of romance, however, which enables a loathly hag to become a beautiful woman, is not so readily accepted.22 By Chaucer's century, species crossing enhanced by the Ovidian texts might easily be seen as a perfect vehicle for exposing identity through discourse.23 Myths of trans formation are so plentiful that the phrase approaches tautology. Stories of the world becoming, transforming itself into something we recognize, constitute the first principles and playground of mythology, and the dis tinction between differing categories of beings becomes less real.24 Chaucer himself dabbled in this transforming art in such works as the Legend of Good Women in which the apology to the daisy, which Chaucer</page><page sequence="11">LESLEY KORDECKI 287 sees as Alceste reconfigured, is prefaced by the singing birds (F 37). He neglects the transformation into birds which usually concludes the story of Philomela, perhaps one of the many omissions in the tales of that col lection. Still, Chaucer has Ariadne, another victim of faithless men, end up transformed into the constellation (F 2222-23). Much later, Andrew Marvell still finds the need to explain that mortal women flee into "The Garden" to avoid divine lust in his references to Daphne and Syrinx. Like the falcon in the Squire's Tale, the feminized world of nature becomes a comfort for the rejected female. But we need not look further than Ovid for Chaucer's primer on mythology. Ovid begins his account with My intention is to tell of bodies changed To different forms; the gods, who made the changes, Will help me?or I hope so?with a poem That runs from the world's beginning to our own days.25 Mythology in Ovid's hands is in some ways equated with change, with flu idity of body amid definitions of identity. Near the end of his poem, Ovid spends a great deal of time on Pythagoras, who in his argument for not eating flesh articulates the subtext of Ovid's collection of tales: The spirit comes and goes, Is housed wherever it wills, shifts residence From beasts to men, from men to beasts, but always It keeps on living. As the pliant wax Is stamped with new designs, and is no longer What once it was, but changes form, and still Is pliant wax, so do I teach that spirit Is evermore the same, though passing always To ever-changing bodies.26 We see Ovid delimiting mythology not as discourse that involves deities or the beginning of the world, but as stories that show the arbitrary nature of nature, or more specifically, of species. But Ovid, like other writers after him, exploits transformation for marginal characters in a different way than for the central masculine subject, whose identity is formed by distancing itself from the non-male, nonhuman other. Myths thus depict transformational metaphysics.27 So when Chaucer alludes to Pegasus in the Squire's description of the brass horse, the text is allow ing myth to permeate and substantiate magic. The medieval Christian romance world, in typical Chaucerian fashion, subsumes the seemingly antithetical pagan world of mythology. The end of the Merchant's Tale, for</page><page sequence="12">288 THE CHAUCER REVIEW example, when Pluto and Proserpyna stroll through the blind knight's garden, demonstrates how blissfully these modes can coexist in Chaucer. But when we come to the falcon in Part Two, we arrive at a fully anthro pomorphized creature, clearly a woman made into a bird (note her "slip" when she forgets herself and talks of "man" and "womman" in lines 552 and 559), whose purpose is to warn Canacee of the perfidy of men, not tercelets. Readers of the poem see the bird as representing the human,28 perhaps even a princess in an earlier version.29 The falcon not only rep resents the human, but also helps articulate the nebulous boundary between animal and human with language constructing the bridge.30 Chaucer the man has the Squire as man projecting the subjectivity of the non-male and non-human falcon, all contained nervously in a storytelling performance that defines as it proceeds.31 The horse represents controlled animality (we need only think of expressions like "reining in," "bridling," "saddled with"), and functions as a familiar icon of masculine magic and masculine subjectivity.32 But the falcon, with its lengthy lament, transforms the narrative into one of a heroine in a stylized romance. The Squire's Tale, like Chaucer's dream visions, focusses on voice, but more specifically on the very speech some one, like the strange knight, delivers, with attention to language and per formance. A single recitation, the falcon's speech, comes to dominate the tale, as the nuanced emotional appeals bring us constantly back to the falcon herself. The pace of the narrative, highly compromised by this lengthy discourse, succumbs to the lament as the Squire ekes out all pathos involved in betrayal. A clue that the subjective mode of this part of the tale shifts is in the Squire's careful assertion that the ring gives Canacee the power not only to understand the speech of the birds, but also to answer in kind (434-36). In other words, the rest of the encounter between woman and animal is precisely in other words?in bird talk. The point is that the ring does not translate the bird's chirps into human language, not exactly; it more accurately enables a human, Canacee, to speak a nonhuman's lan guage: "in hir haukes ledene" (478). This slight distinction helps pre pare us for the rather surreal experience of relating to the falcon's highly contrived, excessively vague and universal story of lost love, for it presumes that there is a nonhuman voice to begin with. Paradoxically, language, the great divider of the human and nonhuman, becomes the site of their union. The tercelet is an interesting betrayer in light of the Parliament, whose tercelet represents merely a diminutive of the royal tercel whom he is advocating in the contest over the formel. The courtly Chaucer could once more be engaged in distinctions among the gentry in the more exteriorized genre of romance. Now we experience a familiar societal</page><page sequence="13">LESLEY KORDECKI 289 injustice in the genre: an untrue lover who abandons the honest lady for the dishonest one (the scavenger kite of line 624). But this is an attempt at a nonhuman, female subjectivity, so despite the stereotypical damsel swooning in despair, we at least learn that the tercelet is at fault, and at fault through the most social of sins: verbal perfidy. Language is never far from the topic at hand. The tercelet betrays through speech just as the serpent to whom he is compared (512). His language becomes identified with the doubleness of the tiger (543), and also the male betrayers in myth (Jason and Paris) and Scripture (Lameth). Attention is given to mythic and bestial imagery in this uni versalized complaint about the manly art of lying: "Ne koude man, by twenty thousand part, / Countrefete the sophymes of his art" (553-54). Somehow this male's very language is tainted, and we respond to the purity of lament, much as we did with Dido in the House of Fame. As a matter of fact, we respond far too readily to the falcon, the non human, because the animal has been appropriated to such an extent that the otherness achieved in the speech derives much more from the gen der of the speaker than from her species. The voice of the animal gives over to the voice of the woman here as the text merges both marginal elements. We do not seriously entertain this story as one of birds. Canacee, the human female, allotted only enough speech to ask the fal con why she tortures herself, is not allowed a verbal response to this affecting account of the bird. Her response (an appropriately traditional feminine one) is to nurture, first through the magic of plants that she now possesses from the ring, and second through the peculiar bed-like cage she constructs for her new pet. The falcon instead speaks through the voice of a woman, constituted by the skewed passive characterization usually permitted women in romance. The two others, bird and woman, will build a nest and await heroism. Discourse is comfort, but comfort does not bring justice or even true remedy, and the tale cannot go on like this for long. Near the end of her story, the falcon compares the faithless tercelet to a caged bird who, despite loving treatment, will escape whenever it can because of its nature and desire for novelty: Whan it cam hym to purpos for to reste, I trowe he hadde thilke text in mynde, That "alle thyng, repeirynge to his kynde, Gladeth hymself;" thus seyn men, as I gesse. Men loven of propre kynde newefangelnesse, As briddes doon that men in cages fede.

(606-20) Critics rightly recognize this passage as a significant clue to Chaucer's emphasis, but not all relate this exemplum, this clear pause in the lament, to gloss its content, to his experimentation in subjectivity. Susan Crane's careful analysis of this passage explains how the tale takes the Boethian metaphor of a caged creature, gendered only by grammar (the sense is more all creatures, male and female) and makes the allusion work to show men's faithlessness, not women's, as we read in the Romance of the Rose.53 An important piece of evidence in Crane's argument for the fem inized world of the romance in this tale, the passage works in other ways to show how the nonhuman influences the masculine or temporarily and imperfectly feminized subjectivity at work in the latter part of the Squire's performance. Some have argued that Chaucer here "compromises" nature by mak ing Boethius' metaphor into a negative reflection of caged beings,34 or that the point of view of the speaker is being emphasized.35 First to note in the passage, however, is the self-conscious prefacing of the metaphor. The falcon bookishly tells us that the tercelet must have had "thilke text in mynde." Chaucer glosses here, stretches out an already leisurely description of abandonment to stress the unusual point of view of the rejected female falcon. If we stop to consider, the tercelet's "text" con jures a convoluted image of a speechless creature who perches with a lit tle bird-size volume at his side, an image that supports the critics who believe that the tale satirizes its matter. We then are struck by the phrase that all things, returning to their nature, "gladeth" or "comfort" them selves. But we are not really talking of all things here, only nonhumans (birds) caged by humans, humans who learn that a bird's nature is found not in human-constructed cages, or perceptions, but in the woods, with the worms. They comfort themselves in their own alien ways, like the comforting of the falcon by the alien woman. This same metaphor of the caged animal expands in the Manciples Tale to encompass the difficulty of control, not only of the nonhuman's body, but also of its tongue, and by extension, the body and tongue of the non masculine subject. In that tale, more examples of caged creatures are listed; here the bird suffices, for here the experimental Chaucer does not despair</page><page sequence="15">LESLEY KORDECKI 291 of attempting the subjectivity of the "other," and the ungrateful bird can "comfortably" represent a philandering tercelet, not all caged things. So the falcon is not just left; she is duped, fooled by words, which are all that are left her, ineffective as they may be. And her words are espe cially ineffective because they are those of a nonhuman, incomprehen sible, and thus insignificant and powerless, in the non-magical "real" world of human hegemony. The herbs that Canacee can magically har ness to help heal the falcon are part of magic, the non-conquered, non textualized subculture. All this adds to the exoticism of the tale, the romance's subtle comment on society and the acceptable. The falcon does not seem to heal completely, but remains in the curious hospital bed arranged by Canacee to declare the bird's innocence and victimiza tion: "In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene" (645). The velvet cage is still a cage, positioned only some twenty lines after the caged bird gloss, a reminder that the falcon loses. Canacee, no active hero, aligned with the duped animal, memorializes the falcon's loss with the representations of false fowls on the cage, returning tem porarily to the nonhuman "cover" for the human moral: do not trust men. But why does she need the power of the ring to teach her this when the mirror, the reflection of her identity and that of others, should reveal false men? And why does the feminine part of magic need this lesson reinforced, if not to stress the masculine subject's own preoccu pation with self-definition? In line 651, the Squire indulges in narrative housekeeping that con trasts tellingly with the nest-building to which he leaves Canacee and the falcon. The woman and bird are left marginalized, poignant, beautiful (but isn't Canacee always?), and totally passive, waiting, as it seems, for the "mediacion of Cambalus" (656) to rescue them, right the wrong, and complete the story. The Squire's Tale ends with an abstract of promised text (never deliv ered), followed by a couplet that is left hanging ("Appollo whirleth up . . ."), a gesture that belies conclusion. And yet the Franklin speaks as if the Squire were clearly finished. The Franklin may be gently cen soring the prolixity of the Squire, but readers have also found other rea sons for the abrupt ending, some of which lead to the subject, if not the subjectivity, of the animal speaker.36 Readers comment on the feminization of the teller.37 However, "the woman" in this instance is not only Canacee, but also the falcon, and the other with whom the Squire dabbles is not always human. Some experiments, we discover here, go too far. Fyler tells us that "Chaucer shows that there are corresponding difficulties, and comic potentiali ties, in treating the other as if it were the same?that is, in domesticat ing the exotic too readily . . ; the exotic?however much apparently</page><page sequence="16">292 THE CHAUCER REVIEW tamed?is always ready to declare its otherness again."38 The bird must be silenced, and for reasons that have more to do with the style of the tale than its teller. A radical re-evaluation of the ending of the tale is provided by Shirley Sharon-Zisser, whose comments bear strikingly on this study of Chaucer's handling of nonhuman speech. She believes that the "two prominent components of the tale's surface structure are also salient features of two non mimetic literary modes: magic (fantasy); and the self-conscious use of rhetoric (metafiction)."39 Magic involves a form of discourse that asks the reader not to look too closely into the artifice at hand, and metafiction, which Sharon-Zisser exemplifies with the Squire's use of diminutio and occupatio, defining them as "apologies of inadequacy" and "pretexts of haste" which "indicate self-reflexivity,"40 in a sense asks the reader to look too closely. Both are non mimetic and intertwined in such a way as to deny any consistent reading of the tale. The story remains, then, not a failed narrative, but an example of discourse almost shutting itself down. At the end of her article, Sharon-Zisser hints at how this phenomenon stops before something politically challenging (like a less restrictive attitude about women or animals?) can occur.41 Magic and metafiction form a coupling akin to nonhuman discourse and authorial glossing, the two strategies that Chaucer exploits to stretch his subjective framework. Although certainly a broader category, magic involves the same transcendence of mimetic bounds that non-exclu sionary speech entails. Magic and animal language both escape the lim iting effects of the monologic human (that is, masculine) perspective. A sense of something less restrictive, less muzzling arises with the text that dares to imagine the talking animal. And, following Sharon-Zisser's analy sis, the reader indulges in this alternative discourse non mimetically, with fewer demands on referential logic. At the same time, however, the tale's preoccupation with glossing tech niques, self-conscious utterances distancing the reader from the text, produces moments in which the verbal performance struggling to reflect this magical world becomes overt. But I think this compounds the effect of not only this, but the other two Canterbury tales of talking animals, the Nuns Priest's Tale and the Manciple's Tale. The glossing inherent in this kind of metafiction leads to consideration of subjectivity, and con versely, the possibility of animal discourse challenges the very foundation of subjective authority, authenticity, and privilege. In other words, talk ing animals make Chaucer reflect upon his own hegemonic ownership of words, make him hedge more in his presentation. Dream visions innately enact and exact self-examination, and their rhetorical fussing (great even for the parenthesizing Chaucer) makes sense. The more dramatic and eclectic project of the Canterbury Tales on</page><page sequence="17">LESLEY KORDECKI 293 the one hand seems to remove the subject from the tale by the media tion of a pilgrim narrator, but on the other hand, the poem actually con cretizes and fictionalizes the subjectivity to such an extent to make the program of varying speakers part of the primary task of the text. We see Chaucer taking stock of his experiment at different moments in the col lection, in heavily rhetorical performances like the Man of Law's Tale. The General Prologue and links continually call attention to the verbal project at hand by their establishment and monitoring of the storytelling con test. So I would argue that it is not surprising that the three tales of talk ing animals are also three tales of stylistic exuberance, because the writer who seriously entertains animal discourse is never far from worrying about his own centralized masculine and human perspective. The conversation between the Franklin and the Host at the end of the Squire's Tale can thus be seen to assume a different valence. The refer ence to Apollo in the second to the last line of the Squire acquires an odd significance in light of the Franklin's effusive praise of the Squire's poetic skill: "ther is noon that is heere / Of eloquence that shal be thy peere" (677-78). The Squire ends with an allusion to the god of poetry, the same god who becomes the subject of the last solaas tale in the col lection. Apollo's tragic fate will be dealt with in the Manciple's Tale, here the Franklin may be genuinely praising the Squire for his attempts to encode "gentillesse" in a discourse more amenable to it, the imagined discourse of women and animals, highly stylized in a romantic mode that ultimately runs out of steam. It aborts itself not because it does not or cannot exist, but because the masculine writer is limited by his own com promised perspective of the "other." The animal cannot be allowed to be that; it must be a woman, and yet the woman must conform to the pas sive marginality of the lady of romance. Traditional notions of species and genre block Chaucer's full resolution of this imagined world. If we return briefly to the teller, the lusty young Squire, we are reminded why the Franklin's words can be read as patronizing. This tale could be judged immature precisely because it employs an outmoded genre, one complete with childish magical elements, that was wielded by lesser poets than Chaucer. The same reasons that we think the romance mode a little naive may well have influenced a contemporary audience. The tale does not really have a chance of proceeding this way. Chaucer begins but cannot maintain his attempt at otherness, a failure with odd similarities to the ambiguity Lee Patterson identifies in Chaucer's unsuc cessful tries at establishing an individual presence (and present in rela tion to past) in the Canterbury Tales: "We can recognize this double allegiance in Chaucer's habit of simultaneously positing and undoing a foundational moment. He typically establishes for his poems a legitimiz ing genesis, an originary absoluteness whose contingency and insuffi</page><page sequence="18">294 THE CHAUCER REVIEW ciency are then relentlessly exposed."42 So too can we glimpse Chaucer grappling with the problem of who controls discourse, especially when many of the tales handed down to him were ones in which non autho rized speakers control speech. The woman, Canacee, is taken as far as she can go without challenging the heroic code, and the bird chirps out its last word in its barely concealed anthropomorphic discourse which absorbs and obliterates its nonhuman essence. Both alien discourses, abbreviated and circumscribed, are constrained by the exotic setting which itself is limited by the dominant Western stereotyping of the Orient. The silent woman and bird in their tragic bed-cage are left per petually waiting for the words of the Squire, the man, to rescue them much as Cambalo must in the plot. But the Squire will never speak the words to release them because Chaucer's attempt at alternative voice ends with unlimited possibilities, enhanced by the power of magic, suggested but not sustained.

Plumwood traces Western philosophical perceptions of nature through history and argues a similar dualistic bias in perceptions of women.

Minnis adds that "In sum, it may be argued that Chaucer treats his fictional characters with the respect that the Latin compilers had reserved for their auc tores.

Even in this age, she concludes, the topic was explored more metaphorically.

Historically, according to [Nancy] Chodorow, the male has formed his identity by separating and has been more insistent on rigidly defined categories than the female. Ovid's metamorphoses are overwhelmingly transformations of women." Roberts shows how Rosalind in As You Like It metaphorically transforms herself into "a swan, a hind, a cat, a rat, a cony, a barbary cock pigeon, a parrot, an ape, a monkey, a hyena, and a bird."

According to Alfred David, Chaucer "turns Anelida and Arcite into birds. Throughout the tale . . . there is a happy confusion of the human and animal worlds so that a falcon can tell a princess that men love novelty, as do pet birds which men feed in cages.
