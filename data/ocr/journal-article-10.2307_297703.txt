<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BRONZE MACE FROM WILLINGHAM FEN, CAMBRIDGESHIRE By A. ALFOLDI (Plates i-iv) The bronze votive object shown on plate i forms part of a hoard which must have come from some small shrine or sanctuary. Professor M. Rostovtzeff's essay 1 with its detailed interpretation has already called general attention to this find. The swollen lower part of this typical Hercules club most certainly belongs to the stem adorned with figures and shown with it, though there is a break between the two parts. This must be so, not only because the diameters correspond, but also because the carefully engraved grooves which encircle both the upper part and the lower broken-off part of the club prove their original connection. Professor Babington, to whom belonged the objects found in Willingham Fen in I857, also connected with them the bronze head of an emperor approximately of the same dimensions.2 Professor Rostovtzeff not only accepted this connection but also based on it far-reaching historical conclusions. These views I cannot share; indeed I could not have done so even if the imperial head had actually been attached to the club, a circumstance which in my opinion would have been an impossibility. The features do not appear to me to resemble those of Commodus. The nose only seems aquiline because it is rubbed. The wavy hair is more characteristic of Antoninus Pius, as is most clearly proved by those gold coins in which the laurel wreath does not conceal the way in which the hair is dressed.3 Indeed the whole face suggests this ruler rather than Commodus and thus, in my opinion, the connection of the club with the cult of Commodus cannot be maintained. Rostovtzeff 4 considered that the Hercules club which he had associated with the imperial head was in reality a sceptre.5 A club sceptre could of course only be carried by the handle. How then would it have been possible to grasp and hold upside down the hallowed image of the emperor which is assumed to have been attached to the handle ? Yet the position of the figures mounted on the middle of the mace would make it impossible to grasp it there, and it would not occur to anyone to hold it by the thick end of the club. It can therefore never have been a sceptre ; it must have been set up in some shrine as a votive offering, and further, it must indeed have been made specifically for this purpose. Bronze tubular fragments once encasing wooden cores, probably priestly sceptres, actually occurred in the same find at Willingham Fen (pl. ii). The owl and perhaps also the bird might have been fixed to the end of these tubular fragments. The imperial head also decorated a sceptre, although such a magisterial badge of office does not quite fit in with a rustic sanctuary dedicated to local gods. The deification of the emperors might however have occasioned its inclusion. The new photographs, which I owe to the kindness of Mr. G. H. S. Bushnell, show below the bust (pl. II) the remains of a ring, narrower than the bust itself, roughly cast and not polished, as was the club. This narrow part was certainly not visible, when fitted into the top of the handle. As the bust has a hole at the back (pl. ii) for a pin or rivet, the head must have been mounted on wood. It is important to emphasize that the bottom ring is too large to fit into the part of the club which had been mounted below it by the Museum-as Mr. Bushnell verified at my request. Thus the club and the imperial bust could definitely not have belonged together. 1 M. Rostovtzeff ' Commodus-Hercules in Britain ', JRS. XIII, 1923, 9I f.

Lam- brechts' Contributions a l'6tude des divinitts celtiques, 1942, 64 if., 89) were persuaded by Rostovtzeff's argument and knowledge to accept the association of club and imperial head.</page><page sequence="2">20 A. ALFOLDI The unusual decoration of the bronze mace with figures and attributes seems at first sight to be a local peculiarity. Yet the execution and shape of the club with its knob-like projections is so typical of classical Roman bronzework that methodical considerations of form will lead us to inquire whether the other accessories connected with it may not have a southern origin. A wall-painting in Livia's House on the Palatine depicting a rustic shrine (Room iv, c) may further our inquiry. The early copy by the painter Marozzi,6 here reproduced (pl. iv), shows important details now faded on the original (pl. m). The shrine consists of a curved wall or large niche on which are seen three archaic bronze statuettes of Hecate, the whole being set in a romantic landscape. In the middle of the curve, on the spot where the cult image could be expected, there stands on a stone pediment a huge bronze club. It is adorned with the heads of an antelope, a stag, and a wild boar and round it are twined fillet-ribbons. Here also the handle or upper part of the club is uppermost, and the top of the handle is surrounded by a wide bronze disc decorated all round with hooks that are like the griffins' heads found on the rims of archaic Greek bronze cauldrons and perhaps even are their degenerate descendants. Metal pendants hang from the disc to form rattles, which, as in all primitive religions, were meant to drive away evil spirits. It has not hitherto been realized that we are here dealing with a club. In 1875 Th. Schreiber conceived the ' singolaro oggetto conico ' as a primitive substitute for an image of a god.7 Rostovtzeff speaks of ' an object imagined as made of bronze, which we generally call a baluster or baetylus .8 Rizzo calls it ' un oggetto di bronzo, simile ad un grand alabastron' ;9 and F. Messerschmidt simply describes the object in question as an ' Artemis pillar '.1O But Marozzi's copy (pl. iv) clearly reveals the corolla-shaped base on which the club rests ; and the peculiarity of this cult symbol is explained by the miniature club from Willingham Fen. The extraordinary thing about it is that the little shrine set in the romantic landscape in the wall-painting seems to be dedicated, not to Hercules, but to Diana. The golden crown (stephane) set with coloured gems lying by the club is suitable to a goddess and not to a god. The description of Philostratos (Imag. i, 28, 6) corroborates this: Kca Tr)V 'AypoTEpav TIpOlOVTES aUovTra( VECAS yap TlS avTrS EKEt Kal a(yaAa \ElOV OTO TOr XpOVov Kal OV,LOV KEpaaXi Kai apKTcoV, VEErTal 5E aVcTfl Kai &amp;pia avETx, as well as the statement of Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. I4: -Ai Ti TOlS &amp;olS 'ApTEIUUI"oS ErnlKCOS EAacv KEpaTcr TrrpoTrra, - S 'v A3EVTiVvc PoCov, and that of Virgil, Eclog. VII, 29: ' Saetosi caput hoc apri tibi, Delia, parvus I Et ramosa Micon vivacis cornua cervi,' etc. And the case is made even clearer by a wall-painting from Herculaneum and now, much spoilt, in Naples Museum,11 which seems to portray a scene closely resembling that in Livia's House. There is the same niche (or schola) with the same club-like object in front of it, but this time Diana herself, wearing the same crown, sits at its foot with the stag in front of her, Actaeon with the hound approaching from the left. The close' analogy between the two paintings points to the use of the same model depicting as the cult-object of one of the many Diana cults this hunting weapon,12 for that is what it must be. There exists a number of monuments on which the club is no longer used as the already obsolete symbol of the hunting goddess, but becomes an artistic motif, an accessory to a romantic landscape ; and, as in such cases, the original religious connection is gradually lost to sight and disappears.13 We are now led to inquire whether the club symbol in the middle of a rustic shrine 6E.

If Rizzo's illustration is not misleading, an animal's head is to be detected in the Herculanean painting too; it seems to be attached to the cult club at the bottom left, but A. Maiuri kindly tells me that on the original there appears to be no head. 13 cf. Schreiber and Rizzo, o.c., who give a list of these analogies.</page><page sequence="3">THE BRONZE MACE FROM WILLINGHAM FEN, CAMBRIDGESHIRE 21 came from the Greek East along with so many other borrowings from Hellenism in Roman wall-painting, or whether it is a faithful reflection of one of the original rustic cults of Italy. The detailed examination necessary if this question is to be answered cannot be made within the compass of this short note. All that I can do for the present is to indicate briefly my impression that we are here confronted with something that belongs to the old Italian religion of the humbler classes. For instance, this point of view is corroborated by an eighteenth-century drawing which represents a wall-painting from the villa of Diomedes in Pompeii,14 -a misunderstood copy of such a rustic shrine as we saw on the House of Livia and Herculaneum pictures. It shows a wooden column with an oxhead nailed on it, and a thyrsos behind it, covered with a conical roof. This same umbrella-like roof is also to be seen on the analogous representation in Herculaneum mentioned above,15 but not in that of Livia's House. And, as Messerschmidt has already observed, the columns of the Grave of Porsenna had the same protecting covers. The bronze disc with rattles above the club in the wall-painting in Livia's House, as we remarked, preserved archaic features, which seem to point in the same direction. Again, the same type of rustic shrine consisting of a semi-circular shrine with a cult-pillar at its centre is attested, in Italy also by the mosaic from Praeneste,16 and further analogies are not lacking. We may therefore envisage the possibility that the Willingham Fen votive club has followed Roman models in presenting, not only the shape and the knobs on the Hercules weapon, but also in using the animal's head that we see on it, and accordingly also the rest of the figurative ornament. But at the same time we are struck by an important difference between the British and the Italian club symbols. For the mighty club in the wall-paintings still preserves faithfully its primary character: the animal heads on the club here represent hunting sacrifices, just as the hunters of palaeolithic times consecrated part of their spoils to the supernatural powers ; indeed, corresponding sacrificial customs are to be found in many primitive civilizations. In the British example, however, the bull's head and the other symbols are derived from a higher form of religion. The bull's head is not a mere votive object chosen from among the spoils of hunting, but represents the three-horned bull of Celtic mythology, the ' tarvos trigaranos ', as has been realized by Heichelheim. 17 The second protome of the three-horned bull from Willingham Fen (pl. II) belonged in all probability to a second similar club. The gods and their symbols on the club, however, could only have been applied after the head of the three-horned bull had occupied the chief place as representing the primary hunting-sacrifice ; only at a later date did the anthropomorphic gods and their attributes appear on the votive club-weapons- at least in my view. To Celtic mythology also belongs the little figure of the god Taranis with the wheel,18 who appears to be setting his foot on the same kindly chthonic monster so well known to us from the Jupiter-giant columns; 19 neither the eagle on the globe nor. the dolphin can belong-in spite of their classical symbolism-to the Roman Juppiter and Neptune, but to their Celtic equivalents. Though we must suppose the existence of a formal artistic dependence on Italian models, there can be here no question of a wholesale interpretatio Romana, which arrays the indigenous gods in classic garb and identifies them with the Olympians: we must rather think of it as something useful to the British bronze-smiths in that it enabled them to 14 H.

Comm. 1904, pl. 6, 7. 17 o.c. M. P. Nilsson tells me that in the Orphic poems and in the Oracula Chaldaica heads of animals are often mentioned as symbols of peculiar deities - he also called my attention to the animals on the body of Aion on cult-reliefs. I do not think that these interesting Oriental parallels have any direct con- nection with the Willingham Fen club. 18 For the most recent discussion see P. Lam- brechts, o.c. 64 ff. 19 A. Grenier, Les Gaulois, I945, 344, has already compared the monster with human face under the rider of the ' Juppiter Giant-columns ' with the benevolent genius of Earth. The same Celtic deity with the analogous monster under foot can be seen in the youthful war-god of the bronze Danubian reliefs, whose provenience has been treated by the late Fr. Drexel, in Strena Buliciana, and quite recently by A. Radnoti, in Archaeologiai EOrtesitb, I946-8 (in connection with the new bronze Mithras-relief from Brigetio).</page><page sequence="4">22 THE BRONZE MACE FROM WILLINGHAM FEN, CAMBRIDGESHIRE express their own religious conceptions, but with the impress of a foreign form. However, we must admit the possibility that a very ancient religious practice appertaining to Indo- European peoples sprung from the same source had divided into a higher and a lower stream of historical development, and that even in the Roman period these two currents still left traces of their common origin; the more so as a closely related superstitious practice, I mean the fixing of the heads of beasts on trees by the hunters who killed them, was a widely diffused custom among the Greeks, as K. Meuli has recently shown.20 The terrible ' truncis arborum antefixa ora' in the famous description of the awful scene in the catastrophe of Varus (Ann. i, 6i) points to the same practice among the Germans, and we know that it was not lacking among the Celts. If I have succeeded in arousing the attention of students of religion and civilization to the possibilities I have mentioned, this brief note will have fully achieved its object. 20 K.
