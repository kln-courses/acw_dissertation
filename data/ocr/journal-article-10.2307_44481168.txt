Peace research as a dependent var- iable As far as peace research is concerned, the law of demand and supply functions in a rather perversive manner: the more it is needed, the less it is tolerated. Peace research may be viewed as Situations gebuden: its scope and nature reflect its encompassing political situa- tion. The growth of peace research took place in a period of relatively low political tension, officially labelled as detente. In a previous stage, peace research was hardly tolerated - as is the case nowadays. Thus, part of the 'cold war syndrome' is the relative low level of growth as regards the institutionalization of peace research. The nature of peace research reflects the political situation as well. During its first phase, the cold war period, the East- West confrontation absorbed all attention. Peace re- search tried, on a high level of abstraction, to find out the mechanisms that cause war; it manifested itself as being on the lookout for the 'causes of war and the conditions for * Paper presented to the 10th General Conference of the International Peace Research Association, Györ (Hungary), September 1983 (draft), to the Flemish- Dutch Conference of Sociologists, Amsterdam, Ap- ril 1984 (final version), and to the World University Conference of the Peace Science Society, Rotterdam (Neth.), June 1984.

Gaming, arms race theory, theories of integration, bargaining behavior theories - all these were treated on a high level of abstrac- tion, albeit with the East- West confrontation in mind. During a second phase, there were some substantial changes: the relative detente made for a growing interest in matters of North- South relations, structural violence, revolution, repression, etc. In short, during this period a widening of scope and nature of peace research could take place. Nowadays we are once again obliged to focus our attention on the East-West confron- tation, for we are once again embroiled in cold war problems. However, there are some im- portant differences between both cold war phases. To put it concisely, nowadays the cold war has grown more and more to be an institutionalized , structural phenomenon in- flicting an ever greater part of world affairs. As a result, we are condemned to construct new theories, dealing with specific conditions of a specific and historically unique situation: the Second Cold War. It goes without saying that many elements of the already existing body of theoretical knowlegde can be incorporated within the new framework, that our methods of investigation are useful for many purposes, and that the results of many an inquiry are still valid. What we need, however, is a new paradigm of peace research, on the basis of which we may be able to select parts of existing know- ledge, in order to formulate new theoretical questions and to integrate both. 41</page><page sequence="2">2. Peace research : in need of a new paradigm During the last decade, the use of the term 'paradigm' has grown ideologieverdächtig. 'Paradigms' were often put upon the scene in order to stress the 'fundamental', 'principal' nature of some new interpretations of a given social science. Especially in sociology refer- ences to paradigms were often used to disguise the pseudo-nature of suggested theoretical pluralism:1 relatively small differences could be made absolute, relatively large overlap could be neglected. The abuse of teminology could happen because of its worse confounded meaning: according to Masterman,2 even Kuhn, in his famous book on paradigms,3 used the term in at least twenty-one different senses. Bearing this in mind, we nevertheless use the term 'paradigm' in its general and original meaning, as a common framework which... 'provides scientists not only with a map but also with some of the directions for map- making'.4 In our view, the present condition of peace research can be understood perfectly well by referring to the necessity of a new paradigm. The new cold war period made for a new map of problems, and for the necessity of for- mulating new directions for handling this map. According to Kuhn, 'in learning a paradigm the scientist acquires theory, methods and standards together, usually in an inextricable mixture.'5 As such, paradigms are of a princi- pal and fundamental nature, offering a framework of relevance; they dictate both our choice of subject-matter and of methods. Moreover, paradigms have instrumental value, especially during the early phases of a new period. As Merton puts it, they help us to codify methods of qualitative analysis ... 'in a manner approximating the logical, if not the empirical rigor of quantitative analysis.'6 In this essay we shall deal with this inex- tricable mixture of theory, methods and stan- dards in a necessarily inexhaustive way. The development of a new paradigm can be viewed as a long-term process of gradually evolving insights. One has to reshuffle theoretical ele- ments, to cross traditional boundaries, to make explicit some tacit assumptions of the past, to indicate some new paths of investigation, to put quite a number of basic queries (and to mould these queries into some kind of rank ordering), to develop new standards of rele- vance - in short, developing a new paradigm is a matter of both growing awareness and con- certed efforts. Under normal conditions, this process may last some generations of scientists. Efforts to speed up the process may make for the reverse: for, they stimulate painful confrontations and ideological stances. Peace research, however, does not work under such normal conditions. Peace research is 'concerned with applicability' (Galtung), peace researchers are in a hurry. Thus, we have to 'construct' rather than to 'develop' our new paradigm. On the other hand, when speeding up our re-orientation we have to avoid the pittfalls of ideology. In my view, we cannot tolerate the emergency of the type of ideological debates that accompanied the transition from the first to the second stage (the so-called 'critical' period) of peace re- search. This is so for obvious reasons: loss of time, loss of energy, loss of transparency, etc. How to construct without (ideological) con- straint? In the following paragraphs we will plea for introduction of some methods and ideas from the field of risk-assessment. Of course, we do so for substantial reasons: in our view risk-assessment can function as the hard core of our new paradigm. An additional ar- gument for our proposals lies in the sphere of the above-mentioned problems. Making use of insights that have been developed elsewhere might enable us to speed up the process of re-orientation. Introducing already existing technologies together with the awareness of their possible ideological abuse might help to solve our 'construct without constraint prob- lem'. In my view, the study of risk-assessment is admirably suited to this aim. 3. Peace as relative risk What are the basic assumptions of our paradigm? The second cold war can be typified by a number of fundamental characteristics: 42</page><page sequence="3">a) the East-West confrontation is broadening (as compared with the first cold-war period) and deepening (as compared with the de- tente period). b) both parties are still increasing their military arsenals. As compared with the first cold war period, a relatively high degree of di- versification of weapons systems has been accomplished, mainly as a result of the relative political autonomy of the armament process. c) both parties are incapable of disarming sub- stantially, to practise arms control effec- tively and to evaluate their strategic position completely rationally, d) as a result (a, b, c) a military confrontation will be understood by both parties as possi- ble, yet unbearable: for that reason, they both try to avoid such confrontations. e) however, within each party different opin- ions exist as to the consequences as well as to the inevitability of these confrontations, f) as a result (d, e) and in spite of the enorm- ous damage caused by the use of these modern weapons, some chance of deliberate or incidental war still exists. Moreover, some chance of accidental outbreaks of war exists. A situation like this can be defined in terms of risk. Risk can be understood as the product of chance (upon damage) and (the amount of) damage , or R = C X D. Risk-analysis deals with the measurement of both factors, however complex they are. Peace research may use the insights of risk analysis; thus 'peace' may be understood as 1 C X D In other words: 'peace' and 'security' are considered as synonymous, as relatively exist- ing situations, to be effectuated by minimizing C (peaceful coexistence, confidence building, better agreements, etc.), D (disarmament measures) or both (arms control). Absolute security ('real peace') could only be reached if one of the two factors could be made zero; however, given our assumptions, this is impos- sible. What are the standards of our paradigm? When defining 'peace' like we do, one be- comes an easy target for all kind of ideological criticism. I would like to stress the point that our definition, our approach is a mere instru- mental one, intended to furnish peace research with an additional analytical instrument. Within our definition there is ample room for all types of ideological discussion, if one wishes. On the other hand, in social science, an 'instrumental approach' is often accom- panied by some conservative, status-quo flavour; it suffices to recall the endless debate about value-bound, 'value-free' sociology. Of course, we have also to be aware of this danger. In my opinion, it might be avoided by a proper use of the already existing methods and the knowledge of the already developed awareness, both in the field of risk-assessment. What are the theories and methods of our paradigm? It should be stressed that our sub- ject-matter can be considered as an extreme and very exceptional case. Even at a high degree of minimalization of C and D, the product of both remains disastrous to mankind. In this respect, our subject-matter is compara- ble with other situations of macro-risk, for instance nuclear energy. According to Stallen7 ... 'any numerical measure of risk becomes more inadequate the more harmful the event is, even though its probability decreases at the same time. When the impact reaches the global macro-scale, such a quantitative assessment of risk is entirely inadequate.' Stallen, now quot- ing Groenewold, continues: 'with regard to macro-risks, non-zero probabilities are catas- trophic sooner or later and it seems only wise to avert their possibility as far as possible.'8 And he concludes: 'recognizing the existence of a macro-risk can only be a qualitative ex- pression of both the expectation of and the concern with the premature (on the biological or geological timescale) extinction of a species like man or of the earthly eco-system by artifi- cial rather than natural causes'.9 If we plea for using some methods of risk-assessment, it is by way of analogy. Some of its ideas and prob- lems, especially in case of exceptional, macro- risk situations, may throw new light upon our subject-matter. As we suggested earlier, they 43</page><page sequence="4">may serve as the hard core of our new paradigm. In the following paragraphs some of these problems and ideas will be spotlighted. In my opinion this may serve to expose the basic queries of our paradigm. 4. Risk-analysis and risk-assessment: some operational devices In the existing literature on risk-analysis and risk-assessment,10 many questions are raised. Some of them are rather old ones, disguised by new theoretical or methodological clothes; others are really new. Some disputes relate to matters of a merely definitional nature:11 others concern important philosophical, societal and scientific matters. Taking all together, one might say that there is a lot of dispute, a lot of integration of scientific methods and insights; a lot of uncertainty about rather fundamental questions together with a high level of scien- tific reasoning and investigation. As a whole, the literature on risk-analysis and risk-assess- ment bears a wealth of ideas, many of them capable of contributing to the necessary operationalization of our proposed new paradigm. Let me, by way of demonstration, give some examples: 4.1. Risk-analysis : the problem of definition In risk-analysis some tendency exists to define risk in terms of regularity ('mechanisms'). In general, such definitions can be viewed as both indicating some constituting elements of risk and hypothesing some relations between these. The borderline between definition and hypothesis is always rather vague: definitions are often formulated with an eye on thjir po- tential operational value. Nevertheless, a dis- tinction should be made between hypothesis as a constituting device and as a follow-up stage of a definition. Only the last procedure is, methodologically, a correct one. Moreover, only in this case may a definition keep some heuristic value, even if some of its 'encom- passing' hypotheses are refuted. Our 'definition' (R = C X D) is a very rough one. In fact, each of both constituting elements has to be refined, and has been re- fined indeed, in order to create some insight and to construct some hypotheses that make sense. In fact, when defining risk as a product of chance and damage ('losses'), one stresses the necessity for some standard of multiplica- tion in order to be able to depict some linear relationship between both. Many a study in the field of risk-assessment is dedicated to this problem.12 Moreover, the existence of such a relationship is suggested: the higher D is, the more one will be inclined to spend some efforts to minimize C, and the reverse. It seems plausible to suppose that such 'mechanisms' exist primarily on a micro-level (e.g. safety-procedures in industry, fire pre- ventions etc.). On a macro-level, however, many distortions take place, due to the com- plexity of the subject matter, decision-making, political structure, etc. The Second Cold War is risk on a macro- level. In spite of all modest efforts to minimize C, D or both (arms control,13 'damage limita- tion' as a strategic concept, etc.) the product of both determinants has grown steadily; what- ever the standard of multiplication, type of C-assessment, and standard of measurement of D may be. Of course, peace research has been aware of this. But we have to deal with the problem in a less intuitive, impressionist way, by making good use of the insights that risk-as- sessment methodology may furnish us. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that some of our traditional approaches have grown ob- solete. For instance, the often made distinction between prisoner' s-dilemma games (repres- enting negotiations, disarmament agreements, etc.) and games of the chicken (representing 'abnormal', crisis-like periods) can still be found in almost any introductory peace re- search course. In fact, this distinction has be- come distortive to the understanding of our time: due to the increase of C x D, the negative values of the saddlepoint of prisoner's dilemma (A2B2 in most pay-off matrices) have grown enormously; and on the other hand, the pay-off for cooperation (A IBI) has devaluated to merely avoidance of loss - no more, no less. In fact the differences between both pay-off structures are disappearing, in favour of the chicken's game - we are living in a permanent 44</page><page sequence="5">crisis-situation. Nevertheless, experimental gaming still deals to a large extent with the induction of independent variables in prisoner's dilemma games - not in chicken's games. But perhaps experimental gaming, whether pris- oner's dilemma or chicken's game, fails slowly but surely as a method to understand the ar- mament processes of our times. The Second Cold War can be understood in terms of deci- sion-making under conditions of (relatively high) risk; and this high risk can be viewed as the product of relatively low C (contrary to the chicken's game) and astronomic D. Perhaps any gaming has to fall short of explanatory power under such conditions; perhaps we are bound to be on the lookout for rather new methodologies. If decision theory needs risk- analysis and if, on the other hand, risk-analysis is developing into decision study,14 then peace research may link up with these developments. Perhaps we might make use of these insights and incorporate them in more refined methodologies that may contribute to a better understanding of the unique nature of our period. 4.2. Risk-analysis: ' subjective risk ' as a pro- cess of legitimation R = C X D is not a definition that makes much sense to the minds of decision-makers and the population; it is too abstract, too for- malists. In general, people are only willing to recognize risky situations on a basis of percep- tion, not of analysis. In rather abstract ter- minology, R = C X D (and its dérivâtes) is a comparative conception: it enables us to com- pare different societal situations.15 It forces us to note the presence of totally different levels of risk within a given society; as such, it has some heuristic value. But comparisons of risky situations make only sense as far as they point, implicitly or explicitly, to a much more in- teresting phenomenon: the very fact that a given society is willing to accept such incon- sistencies. According to Frederichs,16 ... 'it is not risks per se which meet with a lack of tolerance in society; this happens only in con- nection with their being regarded as insuffi- ciently legitimated.' This can only be under- stood by making use of the assets of social psychology, in particular psychology of social cognition. As Douglas and Wildavsky put it: 'Questions about acceptable levels of risk can never be answered just by explaining how nature and technology interact. What needs to be explained is how people agree to ignore most of the potential dangers that surround them and interact so as to concentrate only on selected aspects.'17 The following two rules-of-thumb may be useful: (1) the higher the perceived risk, the more a society18 will be inclined to reduce C or/ and D, and (2) the more a society is incapable (technically and/or psychologically) to reduce C or D to a 'bearable' level, the more she will be inclined to legitimize such unbearable situations by reducing or even denying perceived C and/or D. The Second Cold War can be understood as an exceptional situation, in terms of C and D. Even at an extreme low level of C, the product of both factors would rest astronomically high. Moreover, C is increasing rather than decreas- ing, in the opinion of many an expert. As a result, R might be understood as an absolute disaster, all other disasters being less harmful. As a consequence, it would make no sense to use risk analysis by way of comparison; nuc- lear war will always score highest. How to understand the apparent willingness to accept such a high level of risk? However, to answer this crucial question, one has to look at some properties of the defense system, and to the way risk-analysis may deal with them. According to Rowe, 'national defense sys- tems must be considered in a different light from normal societal systems.'19 Rowe suggests that the main difference between both is the blurring of the distinction between vol- untary and involuntary risks within defense systems. However, one might maintain that such blurring is to some extent characteristic for all situations of macro-risk. The often striking dissimilarities between levels of ac- 45</page><page sequence="6">ceptance of macro-risk can be understood by adding some ideas derived from risk-theory to the two rules-of-thumb as mentioned above. Thus, we may add to rule 2 two other ones: (3) if the perceived risks of a system are in- creasing over time any faster than the sys- tem's rate of expansion, this will cause a growth of descriptive and measurement uncertainty20 and (4) the higher the level of descriptive and measurement uncertainty of a given societal risk, the more inclusive processes of dissonance reduction may be. Both can be considered as functions of loss of sys- temic control21. The Second Cold War fits precisely these rules. The 'defense system' (as measured by budget figures, personnel figures, etc.) has grown fast during recent years. On the other hand, perceived R has grown disproportion- ately. One may think of the diversification of weapons systems, the militarization of interna- tional politics, the installment of new nuclear weapons (C), and of the many recent studies in scientific as well as in popularized form about the effects of nuclear warfare (D). In short, 'the system' has grown, R has grown, perceived R has grown even faster. And this, in tum, may stimulate a psychologi- cal climate wherein processes of reduction of relevant information are emotionally justified. Thus, peace research may learn a lot from studies on acceptibility of risk; for they may demonstrate the psychological mechanisms, present within governments as well as among the public at large, that make for the legitima- tion of unbearable situations. Here, again, risk analysis may function as a paradigm (in the sense of an ordering device, as a method of classification of already existing insights and fields of investigation). The way governments reduce or simply deny information about D (effects of nuclear war, shelter programs, sur- vival campaigns) in order to maintain the idea of nuclear deterrence (incapacity to minimize C) as a 'credible' policy runs parallel to other situations of decision-making under conditions of (mis) perceived risk. The same holds true as far as C is concerned: one can refer to the very unsatisfying (and irresponsible) way govern- ments report about accidents with nuclear weapons.22 One may also examine, however, the popu- lation as a whole. If Wildavsky and co-workers are right, if different styles of psychologically and culturally rooted perceptions of risk do exist within one society, then some interesting connections can be made between different and rather isolated regions of peace research. One may consider some suggestions that have been made by Galtung, Laulight, Rapoport, Singer and others during the early sixties about the existence of different 'patterns of thinking' on matters of peace and war among the general public. Furthermore, the efforts of Eckhardt and co-workers to apply the study of person- ality structure to the understanding of war- or peace oriented behaviour must be mentioned, as well as the many efforts to understand hu- man behavior under conditions of risk. In short, we may stimulate our capacity to inter- pret (mis) perceptions of C and D as part of a predictable pattern of behavior, rather than as isolated facts. 4.3. Risk-analysis: the structure of C Theoretically, distinction could be made be- tween 'objective' risk, as measured by empiri- cal methods and 'subjective' risk (denying, under- and over-estimation of empirically measured risks). In practice, however, risks are mostly assessed in a necessarily subjective way: governments, managers, the population will only differ gradually in this respect from scientists. All people are inclined to perceive their situation in a cognitive restricted way, even if they possess some empirical knowledge about it. This does not mean the end of all science (of risk). On the contrary, it stresses the necessity: (1) to develop standards and methods of meas- urements of C and D, and, (2) to study the mechanisms that make for the differences between empirically measured and perceived R. 46</page><page sequence="7">Both series of problems are closely connected: (1) is a precondition for (2); while (2) is needed in order to apply (1) as an instrument of policy making and policy implementation. As to D, the measurement of short- time and even long-term effects of a given event is a rela- tively easy enterprise. It is also possible to compare different D's, on the basis of some arbitrary common standards of measurements. In some cases, long-term effects will exceed to short-term ones; and the reverse. This is im- portant, because groups differ in their willing- ness to include such long-term effects into their frame of reference.23 In other words: one has to be on the lookout for the existence of some regularities that determine this willing- ness. Peace research has everything to do with this problem; think of the apparent incapacity of governments to pay some attention to the long-term effects of armament measures and nuclear warfare. It is in relation to C, where our main methodological problems exist. C is in essence a statistical concept: its value may vary betweeen 0 and 1. On a micro-level it sometimes suffices to observe reality: a certain percentage of mistakes occurs within a certain industrial process, etc. Sometimes a certain C may consist of a complex of different mistakes, errors and disturbances: it has some inner structure. We may study this by trial-and- error, or by simulation by means of 'accident tree construction'. On a macro-level such direct approaches are impossible, this being so for obvious reasons. As a consequence, we transplanted some methods and concepts, used for the manipulation of C on a micro-level to the study of the structure of C on the macro- level; obviously not only to increase our knowledge but also to stimulate our capacity to control. Again, peace research may make a fortunate use of these efforts, in particular as far as the study of crisis management is concerned. One may think of distinctions between 'technical' and 'human' errors (and their in- terplay),24 and Häfele's categories of 'residual' and 'non-residual' risk.25 By treating interna- tional crises as structured situations of macro- risk, peace research could pay more attention to the 'synergistic' effects of some erroneous events. A promising approach has been suggested by Daniel Frei and Philip Sontag, in their 'tentative quantitative evaluation of the risks of unintentional nuclear war'.26 But as a whole, peace research has unduly emphasized the distinction between 'accidental' and 'inci- dental' outbreaks of war. In reality, some in- terrelation exists: crises stimulate accidents with some weapons systems, and such acci- dents may in turn stimulate crises behavior; etc. In fact, this often mentioned distinction has proved unrealistic and even ideological; for it focuses our attention to only one category, suggesting that thinking about accidents has grown obsolete.27 4.4. Risk-analysis as a method of problem- identification The origins of risk-assessment can be located in the sphere of policy-studies. Risks can be viewed as possibilistic costs, to be included in cost-benefit analysis in order to contribute to a more 'rational', inclusive style of policy-mak- ing28. Moreover, risk assessment may make for a more responsible style of policy-making. By assessing the amount of C and D, a policy agency is capable of depicting criteria of acceptable and non-acceptable risks. Such standards are to be developed by means of graphical presentation of different products of C and D. In both cases, policy-de- signers are forced to observe elements of risk within their proposed actions. Both techniques may contribute to compel them to withdraw from the often-apparent inclination to neglect or to underestimate such risky elements. Rather paradoxically, both 'instrumental' uses of risk-analysis may help peace research to preserve its 'critical functions'. When de- fining 'peace' in terms of the relative absence of C and D, one is obliged to compute both factors and - much more important - to depict the development of their constituent parts. Any 'security policy', as it is practiced by both parties in the cold war, includes enormous 'possibilistic costs'. Any change of policy will affect their constituent parts to some degree. Such consequences are often overlooked or 47</page><page sequence="8">underestimated by politicians. By using the methods of risk-analysis, one is doing more than translating the old question: 'security at what price?' In fact, one is trying to figure out the price, and to demonstrate the neglect of ongoing price-developments by many a politi- cian. The same holds true for the second in- strumental application of risk-analysis. Usu- ally, this method enables us to map areas of acceptable, non-acceptable and disputable amounts of risk; in other words, it helps us to develop certain standards of tolerance. When transplanting this method to the field of security policy we are compelled to expli- cate the standards that are used here, and to compare them with those which are used in other, 'normal' fields of policy-making. We are once more confronted with the enormous divergence of both patterns of risk-taking. In fact, this type of 'instrumental' approach helps us to demonstrate the inconsistencies of gov- ernmental policy; or, better, it depicts clearly the fundamental irrationalities of security policy. 5. Peace research , paradigms and theory construction The examples I mentioned so far are quite arbitrary ones; they are only mentioned here by way of demonstration. Together with some other applications derived from risk assessment theory they may function as the hard core of the operational framework of our paradigm. So far, I mentioned some basic assumptions, some standards, some theoretical and operational de- vices of this paradigm. Let me finish by saying a few words about the relation between this paradigm and theory construction. As I suggested in the first paragraph, peace research is at the crossroads. From the very beginning, it claimed to be on the lookout for 'the causes of war' and 'the conditions for peace'; one may find these claims in the first chapters of many an introduction to peace research, in many titles of books, articles, manifestos, etc. In other words: peace research tried to construct a body of 'grand theories' - theories of a high level of abstraction - in order to understand a specific historical situation, the East- West confrontation. When trying to construct such 'grand theories', one has to choose from two proce- dures. The first one is: logical deduction. Al- ready existing (parts of) theories of a high level of abstraction have to be modified, re-defined, completed, etc., in order to make them suitable to understand our specific situation. A good example of this type of approach can be found in the work of Rattinger.29 He furnishes peace research with a brilliant set of modifications of the Richardson equations on arms race dynamics - and he shows clearly the many efforts of other peace researchers to do the same. The second procedure stands for the long path of empirical research: starting on a zero- base, one finds some correlations that enable us to construct some 'theories of the middle range' (Merton). After a long period of empiri- cal verification we may become able to for- mulate some theoretical orientations at a higher level of abstraction. The work of Singer and co-workers - the 'correlates of war project' - can be viewed as an outstanding example of this second, inductive type of reasoning.30 As we all know, both procedures are neces- sary tools for constructing reliable, valid, not- too-biased types of grand theories. If both procedures are practised in a well-balanced way, we may find ourselves in the long run capable to formulate questions of a high level of abstraction - and to answer these questions by the programming of research in a consis- tent, well-structured way. Peace research is still far away from this level of sophistication. And it is even a matter of dispute whether or not we have to continue along the lines we depicted already long ago. In my opinion, the general theories (and part of their modifications) of the first period of peace research (the first cold war) are becoming more or less obsolete: for they refer to rather irrelevant, outdated histori- cal situations. What sense does it make to modify the original 'interactional' arms race theories, if at the same time the existence of a number of 'Eigendynamik- mechanisms' are to be viewed as the hard core of the armament 48</page><page sequence="9">processes in East and West? Why should we exhaust ourselves by finding some structure of 'correlates of war' in the past, if at the same time a specific, and historically unique near-to- war confrontation between East and West is becoming a lasting, institutionalized and all- encompassing formula of political activity - and of threat to humanity? Again, peace re- search is at the crossroads. As I suggested in this essay, it has to make two choices. The first one is a matter of intellectual honesty: are we prepared to recognize the unique nature of our period, as summed up in the assumptions of our paradigm, or not? If so, we have to start a fundamental and often painful process of theoretical reorientation. Our second choice deals with intelligent opportunism: it is a choice between long-term sophistication and short-term relevance. However, thanks to the existence of Risk-analysis, if we choose the second option, we are not bound to leave the first one entirely. So, what are we waiting for? NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. Cf.

Within the theoretical literature on risk-analysis and -assessment some tendency exists to incor- porate the findings of this domain into that of decision theory. Neither risk-assessment per se, nor decision theories could produce satisfying formulas: together they might help us to over- come some theoretical problems in the study of decision-making under conditions of risk. See, among others, Raiffa's contribution in Kun- reuther and Ley. 15. J. Niezing, 'Security: the case of conflicting policies', in: Bulletin of Peace Proposals, 1976, 2. Also in: J.

London, Rose Ltd., 1977. 18. It goes without saying that 'the society' is a mere anthropomorphism. Thompson &amp; Wil- davsky suggest the existence of different styles of risk-management within one society (M. Thompson and A. Wildavsky: 'A Proposal to Create a Cultural Theory of Risk', in: Kun- reuther &amp; Ley, p. 145 ff.). Thus, risk is a 'collective construct' (Douglas &amp; Wildavsky, p. 186 ff.), and 'the society' is a necessarily short- hand notice for: certain cognitive processes which function within the context of certain styles of risk-management that belong to the pattern of behavior of certain, politically pre- dominant groups. 49</page><page sequence="10">19.

In my view, his remarks about the methodological foundations of his project offer as much of interest as the eventual research findings do. 50</page></plain_text>
