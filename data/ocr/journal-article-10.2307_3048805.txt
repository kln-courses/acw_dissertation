The new book on the Ara Pacis Augustae by Erika Simon is a good, well-illustrated guide to this famous monument, first recog- nized by von Duhn in 1879 and later reconstructed by Moretti in 1938 between the Tiber and the Mausoleum of Augustus. A monu- ment so prestigious, so outstanding in quality, and so representative of Augustan political imagery has attracted a contentious host of scholarly commentators. The author neatly buries this biblio- graphical hoard beneath the surface of a short, simple text, which is coherent and up-to-date, intelligible to the amateur, and with discrete clues for the expert, even if the lack of documentation might hinder the student. All the principal parts of the Ara Pacis have been concisely presented with the just insistence that the program of the altar embodies abstractly the concept of the Pax Augusta without any anthropomorphic representation of the deity herself. However, the omission of a plan describing the layout of the altar and indicating the location of the reliefs, is not merely an incon- venience to the reader but reveals, as well, a certain inability to envision the synthetic coherency of the compositive concept which governs the Ara Pacis, a concept previously if variously treated by Moretti, Hanell, Ryberg, Toynbee, and Kaihler. That concept depends in part on a Roman feeling for symmetry in history and design, responding to the fictional dyarchy of the Augustan con- stitution and to a very special historical attitude about the life of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS III the past in the present. As Toynbee and others have shown, the Augustan dyarchy of Imperial Family/Senatus Populusque Romanus appears in the arrangement of the large reliefs on the precinct walls: on the south, Aeneas - Imperial Family- "Tellus" or Italia; on the north, Mars and the Lupercal-- Senators and Romans- Roma. Each group seems to incorporate an appropriate legendary past brought into the living present under the aegis of an emblem- atic image, but all is unified in a common enterprise (the cere- mony), in a common achievement (Pax), and in a common expec- tation (an auspicious future). For this reason, although the author follows the usual identifications of the major personalities of the Imperial procession, the placement ofJulia, daughter of Augustus, with her two children and her aunt Octavia on the north frieze cannot be followed. If these personages appeared at all in the reliefs, they must have been present on the south processional frieze where they properly belonged with other members of the Imperial family. Although Simon's conventional recognition of the other Augustan luminaries on the south frieze may be generally acceptable, old damage, faulty restoration, and the pervasive Augustan gloss of family resemblance leave many doubts about specific identifications, as Hanell, V. Poulsen, Gercke, and L. Fabbrini have already indicated in establishing their own rosters of essential personages. Simon is correct, however, in rejecting Curtius's old suggestion that the Pontifex Maximus Lepidus was represented, because Lepidus, the inglorious triumvir, had been in disgraced exile for many years prior to his death in 13 B.C. His appearance here would have been politically inappropriate and historically unjustified. Augustus may indeed have celebrated the virtues of pietas, clementia, iustitia, and aequitas in the Ara Pacis, but his true actions were somewhat less generous. If the Ara Pacis ostensibly celebrated Pax, Concordia, and Religio, it was also dedicated to the Imperial dynasty, assembled in their corporate presence, a message strengthened by the coinci- dence of the dedication with Livia's forty-ninth birthday. And last, the altar specifically commemorated Augustus' successful return from war on July 4, 13 B.C., the "pro reditu meo" celebrated in the Res Gestae and in the ceremonial advent of the Pax Augusta, des- cribed in the processional reliefs. In this context Simon's reference to the shrine of Janus Geminus in the Forum Romanum is especi- ally apt, not only because its doors had been closed to signify the advent of the Augustan Peace but, also, because its system of two entrances closed by gates, as shown on a Neronian coin, probably served as a referential model for the design of the Ara Pacis. Re- cently, Vermeule has reiterated the suggestion that the shape of the Ara Pacis may have been derived from the altar of Zeus Soter at Pergamon. Such a derivation would have furthered the allusion to Octavian made by Cicero in his first Philippic oration, to an Octavian born under the noble sign of Capricorn and destined to be the savior of the state. In a similar vein Horace had interpreted the return of Augustus not just as the beginning of peace, but in Carmina, Iv.5 as the coming of the sun (Apollo) and of the spring (Venus). Such an interpretation leads to Simon's analysis of the meaning of the Aeneas and "Tellus" panels of the Ara Pacis and to Karl Galinsky's positive contributions to the iconography of this monument and to Augustan mythopoeic imagery. Simon considers the "Tellus" panel to be a representation of the specific land Italia, rather than as a generic symbol of agricul- tural and environmental fecundity, Terra Mater or Tellus. Other scholars have preferred a broader view of the ecological symbolism of the "Tellus" panel, seeing in the figure of Terra Mater a sym- metrical companion to the goddess Roma of the neighboring panel. Terra Mater and Roma would then be equivalent manifes- tations of the Ovidian theme of Urbs et Orbis, unified under Augus- tus by the Pax terra marique parta, and emblematic images of the Populus Romanus and of the Imperium, whose connection lies in the Princeps. This latter interpretation would seem to be more con- sistent with an Augustan compositive principle of multiple corres- pondences, established on a basis of balanced relationships. Simon also follows the conventional assumption that the Aeneas panel represents Aeneas at Lavinium offering a white sow to the Penates who are shown in the small temple in the background of the relief. Here too, Aeneas' son Julus-Ascanius, progenitor of the Julian family, holds a shepherd's crook in reference to his grandfather, Anchises, who was a shepherd and not incidentally the lover of Venus. As Simon points out, the companion panel representing Mars with Romulus and Remus not only invoked another Venu- sian echo, since Mars was also her spring-time lover, but Mars as pater Romuli et Remi became the progenitor of the Romans as did Aeneas for the Julian dynasty and Augustus for his patria. This coherent system of design depends very much on controlled echo and harmonious resonance for its cumulative effect. As Vergil translated the Alexandrian bucolic from reverie to immediacy by reference to contemporary events in his Eclogues, as the sculptor of the Prima Porta statue reinterpreted the Poly- kleitan canon in the noble person of Augustus, so too did the designer of the Aeneas and Mars panels of the Ara Pacis impose a political message upon a formal tradition, derived from the idyllic, Hellenistic landscape relief. He endowed these episodes of early Roman history with topical immediacy, fusing an ancient past and a reconstituted present through the resolving process of the Augus- tan vision. The fictive quality of that process, fully revealed in Vergil's Aeneid and in his principal character, Aeneas, is the true subject of Galinsky's book which incorporates the Aeneas and "Tellus" panels into its analysis. P6schl, Malmstr6m, and J.-K. Newman have seen the relevance of the Aeneid, especially Book vi, to the Ara Pacis, but not as completely. Galinsky first presented his theory that the "Tellus" figure should be identified as Venus, the bringer of spring and of plenty, in the American Journal of Archaeology in 1966 and in a Princeton dissertation. In the same time, A. Booth in Latomus also suggested Venus as the central character of the "Tellus" relief, and in 1967 A. Wlosok published an extensive monograph investigating the fundamental role of the goddess in the Aeneid. For Galinsky the determination of Venus as the principal reference in the "Tellus" panel depends on a number of correlated elements in the poetry of Horace, Vergil, and Lucre- tius which he examines in great detail. Furthermore, he associates Venus with a number of referential elements in the panel reliefs of the Ara Pacis: the relationship between Venus, Anchises, and Aeneas; Venus as Venus Genetrix, the ancestress and protector of the Julian line; Venus as the love companion of Mars, both deities of spring and alter-egos of each other in their representative capacities of peace and war; Venus and Roma as the state gods consolidated later by Hadrian and replacing obliquely the older Capitoline triad; Venus and Roma as a metropolitan substitute for the Roma and Augustus of the provinces; Venus and Aeneas as defined by the Aeneid in the roles of protector and protected, a tutelary deity for the Romans; Venus as the preserver of Pax, otherwise unrendered; Venus with Apollo (Actium), whose pre- sence is symbolized by the swans in the "Tellus" panel and in the great floral frieze on the exterior of the precinct wall; Venus kourotrophos as mother of children to whom she gives sustenance and comfort; Venus as Douritis, goddess of the giving earth, and so identified in conjunction with the Aurae on either side of her in the "Tellus" panel, they in turn identified as aspects of Venus Acraia on the left, goddess of the air and fresh water, and Venus Euploia on the right, goddess of the sea, the identifications sug- gested by the elaborate attributes and by the motif of veliJficatio or wind-billowed veil. Such a rich concatenation of references makes an impressive case, although Galinsky does temporize by stating that if Venus is the primary identity of the great female figure in the "Tellus" relief, she also incorporates the ancillary roles of Terra Mater and Italia within her being. Yet Galinsky's interesting thesis is more than the simple accu- mulation of poetic and iconographic references and their applica- tion to the Ara Pacis. It depends also on a Duckworthian apprecia- tion for the harmonious symmetry of design in the Aeneid, seen to exist with equal force in the Ara Pacis which similarly revolves around Aeneas and his avatar, Augustus pacator orbis. For Galinsky, the thematic division in Horace Carmina II and in Vergil Aeneid vi can be diagrammatically expressed in the symmetrical reciprocating development of Roman or Augustan traditions, programs, and interests. Such a division corresponds to the division in the reliefs of the Ara Pacis between the northern (Roman) and southern (Augustan) halves. Underlying the Augustan segment of the</page><page sequence="3">112 THE ART BULLETIN monument there is a Trojan foundation, the symbolic substructure of Vergil's epic poem which adumbrates the present situation and provides the religious basis in pietas for the regime. For this reason Galinsky devotes the greater part of his book to an elaborate and occasionally tendentious explication of the Vergilian transformations of Aeneas proditor, cowardly refugee from burning Troy, into the pius son of Anchises and the heroic founder of the Julian family and Rome. In doing so, Galinsky demon- strates the purposefully fictive mechanisms whereby Vergil put together with great beauty the traditional and conflicting stories of Aeneas' flight from Troy, his rescue of Anchises, the intercession of Venus and the enmity of Juno, the divergent episode of the Trojans in Sicily and Italy, and finally the conclusively noble career of Aeneas in Latium. In keeping with this journey of Aeneas from defeat to spiritual excellence under the protection of the goddess, the Romans may have brought the cult of Venus from Eryx in western Sicily to Rome where a temple to Venus Erycina was erected near the Porta Collina early in the second century B.C. The dedication of this temple, later included within the Gardens of Sallust, was complemented by a temple of Pietas, which, despite Schilling, Galinsky believes intentionally associated the cults of Venus, Magna Mater, and the Trojan legend. Furthermore, the subsequent pietas of Aeneas, consistently reiterated by the Vergilian epithet pius, was legitimized by his dutiful reverence towards Anchises, Venus, and even Juno. In evidence of the latter, Aeneas sacrificed a white sow to Maxima Juno at Lavinium. According to Galinsky, it is probably this event that the Aeneas panel of the Ara Pacis represents, as described in Aeneid viii, with Juno's presence inferred from the ritual nature of the sacrifice. In this redefined context, the appearance of the shrine of the Penates in this relief reinforces the concept of pietas as habitual reverence and Aeneas' strict observance of the rites of the household gods. However much one may accept or reject Galinsky's thesis, his sensitivity to the Augustan propensity to reshape the diverse heri- tage of Rome into rich, elegant form as the true paradigm of an extraordinary present is very enlightening. He has also exposed the deliberate process whereby the unknown pietas of Aeneas became a platitude, strengthened in men's minds by the artful conflation of the pietas Aeneae and the pietas Augusti. Pietas and its benefits may have been the hidden meaning of the Ara Pacis, since the concept of the Pax Augusta so closely followed the moral qualities of virtus, clementia, iustitia, et pietas, inscribed on the gold shield set up in honor of Augustus in the Curia Iulia (Monumentum Ancyranum, 24); the erection of this shield and the beginning of the Aeneid by Vergil coincide in 27 B.C. Similarly, the profound absorption of these virtues into the Augustan dynastic canon may be understood from the coins of Livia, struck under Tiberius, which represented her as Pietas, lustitia, and even as the Venusian Genetrix Orbis. There is, however, another Augustan monument to pietas, the Forum Augustum with its temple of Mars Ultor and galaxy of Roman heroes, which Zanker has presented in a small but excel- lent book, fully annotated and with splendid illustrations and plans. Since Fiorini's publication of the Casa dei Cavalieri di Rodi al Foro di Augusto in 1951, Zanker's monograph is the first work to be devoted solely to a descriptive analysis of the architectural, sculp- tural, and iconographic program of the Forum Augustum. He has succeeded so well that his book will remain the definitive, if pro- vocative study of this monument for many years. While the pietas Augusti of the Ara Pacis manifested the legitimate enjoyment of the Augustan peace, the pietas Augusti of the Forum Augustum clearly revealed the successful discharge of the obligations of warfare and of filial devotion in a just cause. Octavian had vowed a temple to Mars Ultor (the Avenger) at Philippi in 42 B.c. in testimony to his obligation to avenge the murder of his father Caesar. This act confirmed Octavius' piety and its rewards. Typical of Octavius, he not only resurrected an obsolete Republican deity, Mars Ultor, for this purpose, but he also used this act of dedication to recall to the Romans Caesar's similar vow of a temple to Venus at Phar- salus in 48 B.c. for the defeat of Pompey. By the time the great and beautiful Forum Augustum was built (Pliny, N.H. 36.24.102) between the crowded Subura and the Forum Romanum in 2 B.c., the original motive for the dedication had been subsumed by the grander pietistic imagery of the Augustan political propaganda. Pietas was traditionally expressed by wealthy Romans of the late Republic who commissioned large public buildings for the benefit of the state and for their own political advantage. Augustus followed this pattern with a vengeance; he completed projects initiated by Caesar, including the Forum lulium, the Curia, and the Comitium, and he erected many buildings in honor of mem- bers of his family, especially the Aedes divi Caesaris and the Forum Augustum. As Zanker has shown, the immediate prototype of the Augustan Forum was the Forum lulium, and behind it lay the Hellenistic architectural tradition of the rectangular, porti- cated, and enclosed sanctuary, dominated by a central temple. As the Forum lulium culminated in the temple of Venus Genetrix. so too did the temple of Mars Ultor dominate the Forum of Augustus. Furthermore, the placement of the Forum Augustum next to the Julian Comitium and Forum lulium established a deliberate, dynastic association, while the impressive novelty, splendid materials, elegant ornament, coherent axial planning, and grand scale of this complex with its roster of Republican dig- nitaries and deities complemented the old Republican Forum but replaced chaos with ordered dignity. Zanker does not sufficiently stress the subtlety of the Augustan design which developed cross- axes, columnar screens, and variations of scale with dramatic effect. The Forum Augustum was fully enclosed within high walls of which portions still remain; once inside, the Roman citizen, cut off from the world outside, was forced to respond to a physical and psychological environment, totally shaped by Augustus and his repertory of messages. The entire space within the walls would seem to have been filled by the massive bulk and towering height of the temple of Mars, impairing severely the psychological free- dom of the spectator and subjecting him to the pressure of the Augustan presence. The opulence of the temple, set along the central axis of the Forum, conveyed with spreading impact an image of majesty. Since the facade of the temple also lay along the perpendicular cross-axis which ran from the center of one exedra to the other, the spreading pediment pointed through the screens of columns to the assembled statues of Julian or Roman worthies there displayed in apposition to the abstract theme of the pedi- mental sculpture itself. This combination of enclosure, axial and cross-axial progressions terminating in apses, columnar screens which provide rhythm and spatial succession, rich materials, abun- dant statuary, and Greek ornamental refinements, however much derived from different Hellenistic models, here effects a new, ele- gantly harmonious synthesis, dependent itself upon resonating forms and an extended symmetry in the manner of the Ara Pacis. Zanker has beautifully reconstructed the sculptural program of the temple and of the flanking porticoes and exedrae, using Ovid, Fasti v.545-598, Vergil, Aeneid vII.I70-89, and fragments of in- scribed elogia found in situ to establish the general themes. Relying on a relief in Algiers, he places statues of Venus, Mars, and Divus lulius (the Genius Augusti for some) in the apse of the temple; as indicated by the relief, Mars is not the ponderous, bearded pastiche of the Capitoline Museum but a graceful, noble figure recalling the Divus Augustus on the Ravenna relief. The identification of the figures of Romulus, Venus, Mars, Fortuna, and Roma with personifications of the Palatine and Tiber in the corners of the temple pediment depends on Zanker's careful interpretation of the much reduced reproduction of the facade and pedimental sculpture of the temple on a well-known fragment of the Claudian Ara Pietatis in the Villa Medici. Although some of these attributions may be disputed, the arrangement of the ensemble of pedimental sculptures is convincing especially in the context of the statuary found in the flanking exedrae; there can be no question about the central importance of Mars, standing in the pose of Jupiter Capito- linus in a position of primacy exactly at the crossing of the two principal axes of the Forum, at the apex of the pediment, and above the architrave which bore Augustus' name and titles. In the left exedra, there were statues of Latin kings, of Julian personages, and in the center Aeneas, carrying his father Anchises and leading Ascanius; Zanker has reconstructed this latter group very success- fully, relying on pieces in Turin and Bonn as well as on coins and</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 113 wall-paintings. In the right exedra, there stood many statues of Republican generals and consuls, many of them personal enemies but brought together in their historical service to the state around the central figure of Romulus bearing a trophy. If the sequence Mars-Venus-Aeneas-Ascanius-Julii completed itself in Augustus as filius divi Caesaris, the sequence of Mars-Roma-Romulus triumphator-viri summi may also be understood to culminate in Augustus ultor and Romulus-Augustus, as defined by A. Alf6ldi. Because of the connection of all these deities, heroes, and dignita- ries with the house and person of Augustus, the galaxy of viri illustri which peoples the exedrae and porticoes of the Forum Augustum is comparable to the collections of the imagines maiorum found in the houses of the great families, as if the traditional heri- tage of Rome and Augustus were coextensive. Although the Ara Pacis and Forum Augustum are thematically related, the emphasis of the Forum rests upon the Victoria Augusti, whereby the Roman triumph became a quality of the Princeps. Accordingly, as Zanker indicates, Augustus took his place in the triumphal quadriga of bronze, supported by an arch in the center of the plaza directly in front of the temple of Mars. On this arch an inscription to Augustus as Pater Patriae states the full dimension of his auctoritas over the previous history and present reality of the Roman state. Zanker stops here, but the Augustan mythographers did not. By these means, the pietas which Augustus had shown on the Ara Pacis to Aeneas pater et pius was here translated into another form, the pietas augusta, for the new object of Roman piety had become Augustus, the progenitor of a new era. These three books by Simon, Galinsky, and Zanker have contri- buted to our knowledge of Augustan monuments and have illu- minated the evolution of an absolutist, Imperial mystique. They have left to others the analysis of that special Augustan pheno- menon of sanctimony made agreeable and its manifestations high art. RICHARD BRILLIANT Columbia University</page></plain_text>
