ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS: BRINGING MEANING, CULTURE, AND VALUES BACK IN Guest Editors: Roy Suddaby, Kim Eisbach, Royston Greenwood, John Meyer, and Tammar R. Zilber Since Meyer and Rowan's (1977) classic paper, much research has focused on how organizations adapt to institutional pressures. Research in this tradition has shifted from an early focus on ex plaining organizational similarity, to a more recent emphasis on how institutional pressures affect or ganizational change. Although this research has generated an impressive volume of work, the "new" institutionalism has been criticized because "it does not have the guts of institutions in it" (Stinchcombe, 1997: 17). That is, most research focuses on how the institutional environment af fects organizational form and function, without also attending to the values, beliefs, and meanings that underpin form and function. The "guts of in stitutions" is the understanding that institutional pressures only work because they impact the col lective understandings and commitments of indi viduals inside both organizations and institutions. Our goal in this special research forum, thus, is to understand how social structures and practices in side organizations "acquire meaning and stability in their own right rather than as instrumental tools for the achievement of specialized ends" (Lincoln, 1995: 1147). We invite papers that explicitly exam ine the phenomenological underpinnings of insti tutions inside organizations. Our aims are threefold: First, we aim to examine the ideational dynamics of meaning, culture, symbols and values in or ganizations. We explicitly encourage studies that extend recent efforts to explore the role of mean ing (Zilber, 2002), symbols (Creed, Scully, &amp; Austen, 2002), and values (Greenwood &amp; tim ings, 1996) that explain how organizational prac tices acquire meaning and significance beyond their immediate productive value. Second, we hope to reconnect institutional re search with processes that occur inside organi zations. While we now know how institutional pressures influence interorganizational relations and structure organizational fields, considerably less attention has been paid to understanding how logics, fads, and fashions and other macro pressures are interpreted by actors inside organ izations. We encourage here an extension of the tradition established by Gouldner (1954) and Selznick (1949) that examines how the infusion of values and meanings can subvert rationality and agency to produce unanticipated conse quences in organizations. Third, we emphasize the need to extend the range of methodological tools used to study the effects of meanings, culture, and values in organ izations. We seek papers that employ interpre tive methods that focus on how "different mean ings held by different persons or groups produce or sustain a sense of truth, particularly in the face of competing definitions of reality" (Gephart, 2004: 457). We encourage papers that employ case histories, interviews, ethnographies, ethno statistics, grounded theory, sense-making, conver sational analysis, narrative, semiotics, content analysis, rhetoric, and other underrepresented methodologies. Prospective contributors may wish to consider (but are not limited to) the following research questions: What are the motivations of organizations that adopt highly institutionalized practices? Are the espoused motivations for adopting TQM, for ex ample, expressed in terms of the need to conform or the need to improve performance? How is the adoption of management fads and fashions con tested inside organizations? How are institutional logics understood by actors inside organizations? How do actors reconcile competing logics? How, for example, are debates over the adoption of corporate social responsi bility framed by different constituents inside an organization; are they framed in terms of moral ity or share performance? Why do organizations engage in practices that have no discernible relationship with technical efficiency? Why do for-profit corporations col 468 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Why do they construct corporate histo ries? How are such practices framed by manage ment? How are they understood by employees? What persuasive techniques are used by manage ment to convince shareholders that adoption is in their interests? How are institutional categories constructed and given meaning? What boundary work goes into creating categories that define access to eco nomic and institutional resources? How, for ex ample, does the creation of such categories as "technology," "affirmative action," or "human resources" construct actors and confer differen tial access to resources within organizations? What boundary work goes into expanding or contracting such categories? What is the cultural basis of management? What core values make popular management parables more credible than empirical research among practitioners? What are the key ceremonial and ritualistic elements of leadership or management that offer purpose and meaning beyond bare claims to legitimacy? How are the ceremonial elements of organizations (i.e., annual meetings, letters to shareholders) interpreted by various audiences? In sum, we are interested in bringing meaning, culture and values back into institutional theory and institutional processes back inside organi zations as a way to deepen our understanding of how institutional pressures shape organizational behavior.

ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF MANAGEMENT RESEARCH: PEOPLE, TECHNOLOGY, AND GLOBALIZATION Guest Editors: Thomas Rochan, Mauro Guillen, Larry Hunter, and Siobhan O'Mahony In a recent editors' forum in AMJ (December, 2005), Rynes and Shapiro raised the question of whether management and organizational research should have more impact on public policy. Most of the forum's participants answered with a resound ing "yes." In an attempt to address the challenges researchers face in seeking to have such an impact, we are now organizing a special research forum in AMJ. Our goal is to illustrate how scholarly re search can address issues relevant to the societies we serve in a way that generates useful implica tions for public policy debate and decision making. Speaking to public policy issues requires us to look beyond the boundaries of a single organization in defining problems of concern to society and/or policy makers. Policy making inevitably involves taking into consideration the problems and inter ests of multiple constituencies (business, environ ment, workforce, communities, etc.) rather than fo cusing solely on managerial problems or interests. This type of research also calls for consideration of a broad array of causal forces and levers for change, some of which lie beyond the control of individual organizations. Thus, our research models might need to expand on both the independent and de pendent variable sides of the equation. An impor tant goal of this effort is to expand our thinking in this way, both for this special forum and for subse quent management and organizational research. More specifically, this special research forum will be an effort to explore the public policy impli cations of management research in the areas of people, technology, and globalization. We encour age potential contributors to view the people, tech nology, and globalization foci broadly. We wel come any empirical research that has distinct implications for public policy as long as it makes a meaningful theoretical contribution in a topic area that is of interest to the general management read ership of AMJ and is consistent with this journal's mission. Papers that encompass two or more of the people, technology, and globalization domains are especially welcomed, as are papers that address policy issues from all parts of the world. Illustrative topics within each of the three broad domains of the special research forum are identified below. People and public policy. Implications of the management of people for public policy, and how public policy shapes human resource manage ment, work, and employment. Research areas include employee voice and representation, per formance evaluation and reward systems, discrim ination, changes in pensions and benefits, life-time employment versus job insecurity, part-time and temporary workers, national competitiveness and wage levels/productivity, employee training and retention, labor mobility and other related issues. Comparative papers examining differences and similarities among nations (or other entities that feature differing policy regimes) are welcomed. Public policy and globalization. How public policy influences and/or is shaped by emerging trends in the global economy including out sourcing/off-shoring, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, global strategic alliances, joint ven tures, supply chains, and contractor relation ships. Has the development of transnational gov ernmental institutions kept pace with the globalization of economic activity? If not, how might this gap be closed? Analysis of these issues should have a specific public policy focus for national or local governments or transnational institutions such as the International Labour Or ganization (ILO) or the Organisation for Eco nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Public policy and technology. In what ways does the adoption and diffusion of new technologies affect or challenge public policy? Conversely, how do public policies affect investment in technolo gies and their adoption or diffusion? What are the policy implications of communal forms of technol ogy development? How has the intersection of pol icy and technology created new occupations or professions? How do public-private partnerships such as industry-university-government consortia 470 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@univ.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of no more than 100 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use bold face for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use sec ond- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS [1st level] Data and Sample [2nd level] Measures [2nd level] Independent variable. [3rd level] Dependent variables. [3rd level] Footnotes Use footnotes, not endnotes. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number (Hy pothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Put quotation marks around the first appearance in your paper of each technical term, or define it. 472</page><page sequence="6">2007 Style Guide for Authors 473 Abbreviations. Avoid using them for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a x2 test." Do use symbols and numbers to report results and give formulas. Italicize letters that are custom arily italicized [p, r, b, F, Z, and so forth). Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with complete sentences. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Keep equations in your running text unless they contain oversized symbols or division, and/or are very important in your research. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? [e-MkiXJ*] Pv(Yt = ytxt) =-YtT~&gt; (1) where Yt is. . . . Define each new term in all equations. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Using the plural? changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?is one solution; using "he or she" ("him or her") is another. Active voice and first person. Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Be concise. Avoid exact reproductions of surveys. Label appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within ap pendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to see preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and boldface, but in upper- and lower-case letters. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place them at the end of your manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure needs an introductory sentence in your text. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type. Don't use code names and abbrevi ations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left cor ners of their tables.</page><page sequence="7">474 Academy of Management Journal April Use superscript small letters to designate table footnotes. A lettered footnote may be used to sum marize significance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at. . . . Or report significance levels in separate footnotes placed in a stack under your regular table footnotes. Example: tp &lt; .10 *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 More on figures. Figures, unlike tables, have graphics. Make sure your figures will print out clearly so that they can be scanned. Do not use color. Use the same full variable names you use in your text and tables. Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifi cations of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example above. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation? (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Homer, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation?(Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers in citations. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation with no author. For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs [Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.)
