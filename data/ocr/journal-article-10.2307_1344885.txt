<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narrative Fictions and Reality A comment on Frank Kermode's The Sense of an Ending ROY PASCAL The discussion of the nature of the structural fictions of narrative seems scarcely to have been taken further since Frank Kermode's brilliant book, The Sense of an Ending, that appeared in 1967. It is disappointing that the essays in The Theory of the Novel (1974), edited by John Halperin, do not investigate this problem, and Kermode's own contribution to this volume, though it is largely concerned with Roland Barthes, occupies itself with the later structuralist and not the radi- cal questioner of Le degre zero de l'ecriture. Here I want to take up a question concerning the general conception of the nature and function of fictions, pri- marily of novelistic fictions, though it might include other fictions too, logical or legal for instance. In one respect Kermode's wide-ranging, imaginative, and acute exposition comes to conclusions that are in my opinion unsound and that, if they were true, would suggest that the narrative fictions are arbitrary or purely subjective. The book must, I think, leave such an impression; for instance, the perceptive review of it by Ruth apRoberts in the first Number of NOVEL, properly appreciative of Kermode's justification of fictions as a means to "make sense of the world," also accepts the book's thesis that they are "untrue" or "false." I must first briefly sketch Kermode's argument, reducing its richness to the bare theoretical points that are at issue. It starts from Sartre's critique of the tradi- tional form of the novel, the chief falsity of which lies for him in the narrator (personal or impersonal), who writes from the standpoint of the outcome of the events related, and who thereby profoundly distorts the nature of real experience. The whole pattern of a story, the coherence of its events, is built on this false premise of retrospection, for it is only in retrospect that we can recognize events to be significant or irrelevant and contingent. The nature of living, which Sartre powerfully illustrates from the experience of participating in the Resistance during the war, is quite opposite to that of fiction, since when acting we never know the outcome, we are unsure of effects, and we ignore what is happening elsewhere and in the minds of the people around us. Sartre considers this falsifi- cation of life to be a subtle form of self-assertion on the part of the bourgeois class.' In his novel La Nausee of 1938 he had already tried to incorporate the pure contingency and "opacity" of life as it really is. Roland Barthes' Le degre zero de t'ecriture (1953) extends and systematises Sartre's criticism of the narra- tive fictions, though this book is not discussed by Kermode in The Sense of an Ending. In The Sense of an Ending Kermode acknowledges the force of Sartre's criti- 1 J. P. Sartre, Qu'est-ce que la littfrature?, in Situations 2 (1948).</page><page sequence="2">ROY PASCALINARRATIVE FICTIONS cism of the fictional nature of retrospective narrative. The "ending," as he understands it, is representative of the narrative fictions, since it is the postulate of an ending that makes a beginning possible, that makes a meaningful pattern out of the varied items of the story, that fulfils the story. But his theme is totally contrary to Sartre's, for he argues not only that no novel, no story is possible unless some fictional structures are used, but also that, as in other activities of the mind, understanding depends on the invention of fictions (of which language itself is an all-pervading one). He refutes the concept of a fixed "bourgeois" or traditional novel, showing how the history of the novel is from the beginning the history of successive modifications of established fictional forms. Since formal resistance and experimentation are not peculiar to modern times, Kermode looks for a more general source of the modification of fictions, which he defines roughly as the search to "make sense of the world." In the course of his exposition he shows, in a masterly piece of concrete criticism, how Sartre was forced, in La Nausee, to have recourse to novelistic fictions, though here as elsewhere Kermode also acknowledges the significance of the modifications Sartre introduced and the validity of his search for the authentic expression of experience. All this is illuminating and needs no comment here. It is also much to be wel- comed that Kermode does not stop at this point, but also ventures a theory of novelistic fictions within a general theory of fictions, pointing out that philoso- phers who have written on logical and similar fictions have not recognised literary fictions. Much of what he writes in this connexion is admirable; but it is in this area that my doubts arise. For this general theory, Kermode relies greatly on Vaihinger's work, and since my criticism attaches to Vaihinger also, I must first say something about his theory.2 Vaihinger analyses the fictions used in mathematics, logic, law, sociology etc., such as zero and infinity, moral responsibility, "economic man," the absolute, abstract or collective concepts like "tree." His main argument is that while all these concepts do not refer to anything real, at the same time they are not false or misleading. The reason is, that they do not claim to be true, but are tools that the mind invents in order to understand and master the problems of our world. Thus zero or infinity do not indicate any real number, but their invention allows us complicated calculations about reality and practical operations. There is no such thing as "economic man" or pure moral responsibility, but social science and the law require these concepts. Fictions are essentially different from theories or hypotheses, Vaihinger reiterates; they are not would-be descriptions of reality, but only instruments of thought. He points out what grievous errors have resulted when men have taken them to be descriptions of reality, for instance when "tree" has been understood to mean a reality beyond that of empirical experience. So Vaihinger frequently repeats that fictions are "contrary to reality," "arbitrary deviations from reality," but without therefore being delusions or lies.3 2 H. Vaihinger, Die Philosophie des Als-Ob, 1911, translated by C. K. Ogden as The Philosophy of As If, 1924 (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan, 1968). Chapters 2 and 5 of Kermode's The Sense of an Ending are devoted to the theory of fictions, and he acknowledges his debt to Vaihinger. 3 See particularly Chapter 24, "The Main Characteristics of Fictions" in The Philosophy of As If. 41</page><page sequence="3">NOVELjFALL 1977 Kermode seizes on Vaihinger's argument and applies it to the fictions of the novel. These fictions-the perspective of the narrator, coherence of events, the ending that fulfils the story, creates its coherence, and rounds off everything- do not suggest that life itself has such endings, such coherence, such transparency, but are simply means to investigate human life and relationships. Their function- ing is heuristic. From the beginning, from Cervantes onwards, novelists have pointed to the disparity between their invented world and the real world. This disparity leads to a continuing modification of fictions, in order to mitigate their inadequacies; but however modified, they remain fictions and do not mislead so long as we are aware that they are fictional-just as we would not be likely to confuse the world on the stage with the world outside the theatre. Thus Kermode, in his richly suggestive exposition, can justify the role of the imagination in understanding our world and communicating this understanding to others, with- out confusing the fictional with the real. But in one respect, the relationship of these invented fictions to the real world, his theory is perplexing and somewhat unclear. Vaihinger repeatedly insists that the fictions are "contrary to reality"; it is not clear whether Kermode adopts this view, or even has a consistent view. Sometimes he seems to think of them as unreal and arbitrary in Vaihinger's sense, "arbitrary" here meaning above all "subjective," "anthropocentric," 4 in the Kantian sense categories of understand- ing that arise from man's "basic need" to understand (44); thus he can use such a phrase as the right, in modern times, to "an arbitrary and private choice of fictional norms" (36). The historical modification of fictions seems sometimes to be ascribed to the growing sophistication of the mind, which requires more subtle and complex fictions in the place of the inadequate old ones (45), almost as if the world were always the same and the fictional developments recorded in the novel form were the result only of developments in the writers' conscious- ness. On the other hand, when Professor Kermode pursues his illuminating dis- cussion of the difference between the fictional duration of the novel and the "chronicity" of experienced time, he writes that these "fictive models of the tem- poral world" will be "humanly serviceable" only "if they pay adequate respect to what we think of as 'real' time, the chronicity of the waking moment" (54). Here, it will be observed that a condition of the effectiveness of the fiction is that it embodies in some degree ('pays adequate respect to') the reality it seeks to illuminate. When Kermode writes that fictions change "because times change" (64), it seems again likely that he refers their change to changes in the actual world of human activities and relationships, not only to changes in con- sciousness. But such a theme is not made explicit or emphatic, and when, in discussing "ending," he writes that "the End is a fact of life and a fact of the imagination" (57-8), the remark occurs in the context of an argument that asserts the primacy of the mind's fiction of an ending. If I am right that there is some inconsistency on this matter in Professor Kermode's book, I think I may Figures in brackets refer to The Sense of an Ending (London: Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 56. Cita- tions to this edition hereafter appear in parentheses in the text. 42</page><page sequence="4">ROY PASCAL NARRATIVE FICTIONS also be right in thinking that it occurs because some of his insights contradict the theory of Vaihinger in this respect, without leading him to a critical re- examination of this theory. My purpose here is to explore this possibility. But before getting down to this, I must mention a subsidiary problem. Both Vaihinger and Kermode complicate the problem greatly by producing Nietzsche as a witness in their cause. Vaihinger's long last chapter is an extensive review of the evidence in Nietzsche's writings for his theory of fictions, and it is certainly true that, from the early essays onwards, Nietzsche continuously attacked both positivism and idealism with his view that our mental tools-language, numbers, causality etc.-are fictions that do not describe an objective reality but are merely means of mastering nature. Their quality is subjective, anthropomorphic, and we know not things but "metaphors of things." Thus Nietzsche rejoices to provoke us by calling our notions "lies" and "delusions." Now, it is rather surprising that Vaihinger (who had earlier written a full study of Nietzsche) should have found in this type of statement support for his doctrine, since he demonstrates that such terms as "lies" and "delusions" are quite inappropriate for fictions that do not claim to be true. Still more surpris- ingly, he does not seem to notice that Nietzsche's intentions are the very opposite of his own. For Nietzsche's defense of fictions is part of a general onslaught on rational thought and the moral values usually associated with it, in favour of an irrationalism that serves creativity and the will to power. While Vaihinger defends the "untruth" of fictions because of the service they render to rational understanding, Nietzsche rejoices in it because it is one of the many forms of illusion that outstrip the reason. Consequently, Nietzsche associates fictions with irrational theories and ideologies, as expressions of the "will to illusion" that he advocates. The curious thing is that Vaihinger, who makes the difference from hypotheses so fundamental a characteristic of fictions, does not seem to notice that many of the "illusions" that Nietzsche glories in are not fictions, but actual doctrines, ideologies, hypotheses. Kermode, I think unfortunately, takes over this championship of Nietzsche's conception of fictions, though not without some justifiable moral scruple. He quotes (37) a little of the famous passage from Paragraph 4 of Beyond Good and Evil which most directly claims to be about logical fictions5:-"The falsity of an opinion is not any objection to it. ... The question [Kermode says, the "only relevant question"] is how far the opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving" (Nietzsche adds "perhaps even species-breeding"). Though Nietzsche in the following sentences (not referred to by Kermode) goes on to speak of these "false opinions" as "logical fictions," it is clear that here, as else- where, what he is thinking of includes the postulates of his whole irrationalistic, 5 Trans. by Walter Kaufmann (New York: Random House, 1966), pp. 11-12. The paragraph opens: "The falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound strangest. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life-preserving, species- preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating. And we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments . . . are the most indispensable for us; that without accepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self-identical, without a constant falsification of the world by means of numbers, man could not live .. ." 43</page><page sequence="5">NOVELIFALL 1977 individualistic ethic. His use of the phrase "the falsest opinions" itself indicates that he is thinking of theories or faiths, as indeed when he calls them "lies" and "delusions." Now, Kermode immediately observes that the above quotation from Nietzsche contains an immense moral danger, since success becomes the sole criterion of the value of a notion or judgment. He therefore tries to fend off the danger by saying that the danger arises when the fiction is taken to be a state- ment about reality, when it consequently degenerates into a myth. The danger lies, then, in how we understand Nietzsche's contention, not in the contention itself. Kermode himself gives as an example the doctrine of anti-semitism, but this only deepens the confusion. Anti-semitism cannot be called a fiction in Vaihinger's sense, for it is a cultural and biological doctrine, theory, or if you like hypothesis, claiming to be a truth. The fault in assertions like those of Nietzsche's quoted by Kermode above is not that they have been falsely considered to be theories or myths, but that they are in fact theoretical, ideological assertions, totally different in kind from logical and other fictions. I could (and should have liked to) have ignored the issue of Nietzsche were it not that Kermode, embracing Vaihinger's ascription of fictions to the category of "the consciously false," concludes: "They [the literary fictions] are not subject, like hypotheses, to proof or disconfirmation; only, if they come to lose their operational effectiveness, to neglect" (40). This has precisely the pragmatic Nietzschean ring that causes him, in the ethical sphere, alarm, since it suggests that there can be no test of truth or reality for fictions, only that of effectiveness. At the same time, this term is not easily applicable to literature; and, more importantly, perhaps this is no true alternative, since one of the conditions of "effectiveness" might well be truth. From these critical considerations there arise three main groups of questions, to which I would suggest an approach, if not an answer. They are: Does not the campaign led by Sartre and Barthes against the fictions of the "bourgeois" novel aim at the foundations of "story" of all types? Is the coherence found in every story, the pattern, alien to reality? And finally: Have the narrative fictions only a subjective or arbitrary source? and, what hangs on our answer? Story and Novel Throughout the criticism of Sartre and Barthes, in Adorno's aesthetics too,6 the novel is defined as a bourgeois art form, and the narrative fictions are considered to be powerful instruments of the bourgeois class in asserting its ideological predominance. By "bourgeois" is meant the middle class of western European civilisation, in the period opening roughly in the 17th century; Cervantes and Defoe are the great initiators of its fiction. The fictions that these critics indict exist in all essentials of every type of story-the retrospective narrative, the narrator who can tell his readers the thoughts and feelings of his characters, the creation of coherence out of accidents, the fulfilling ending. Stories con- 6 See particularly the essay "Standort des Erzihlers im zeitgenossischen Roman" (1954), reprinted in Theodor W. Adorno, Noten zur Literatur i, (Bibliothek Suhrkamp: 1965). 44</page><page sequence="6">ROY PASCAL NARRATIVE FICTIONS structed upon these fictions have been and are narrated in all cultures; we know them best, outside the novel, in Greek epic, the Biblical stories, in myth generally, in folktale, as well as in historical narrative. It is absurd to claim that the narra- tive fictions serve merely bourgeois interests; they are a universal means of understanding. What sort of understanding, and understanding of what? L. O. Mink has done us a service by calling our attention to the book of W. B. Gallie, Philosophy and the Historical Understanding.7 Professor Gallie is here concerned with the function of historical narrative, but he sees its connexion with fictional story, and indeed uses a simple model of the latter to begin his investigation (it is a pity that he seems to be unaware of the controversy over literary fictions and hence does not discuss more sophisticated story-models). Professor Gallie takes a story not as a completed object, whose meaning is to be summed up in its conclusion, but as something that is read or listened to, whose meaning lies in the cumulative experiences of the reading process. As we read, we are led to form a series of anticipations, of provisional conclusions, which are continually corrected by later events. While the ending is of supreme importance, since it alone establishes the unity of all items of the story, it also is never final, for we always find more in a story on re-reading, and our understanding of the story is thereby modified. A story is inexhaustible. Gallie lays stress upon the interplay of accident and coherence. If it is a story, the events and final outcome must be impredictable until they occur. That is, the ending, the coherence do not deny the contingent, they are indeed composed out of contingencies; "the factor of contingency," Gallie writes, "that matches that in everyday life," is embodied in the very nature of story. The main task of the story-teller is, not to eliminate the accidental and contingent, but to show how some elements in the contingent can be turned, in the process of the story, into meaning.8 For Gallie, narrative (and he is chiefly concerned with narrative in histori- ography) is an essential instrument for understanding human relationships, the relations between thought, will, and behaviour, and especially between accident and coherence, i.e., the understanding of the relationship between the manage- able and the unmanageable. There is no other means than narrative by which we can project a model that will illuminate these relationships and allow us to contemplate them. H. R. Jauss comes to similar conclusions when he refutes Droysen's wish to abolish narrative from historiography in the interests of truth. Professor Jauss, a literary scholar, is well aware of the fictions that historical narrative depends upon, but in spite of (or rather because of) the fictions of nar- 7 W. B. Gallie, Philosophy and the Historical Understanding (New York: Schocken Books, 1964). L. O. Mink's essay, "History and Fiction as Modes of Comprehension" appeared in New Directions in Literary History, ed. Ralph Cohen, (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1974). Mink makes some criticisms of Gallie's work, but these are not important in the present context. s It might have been shown how brilliantly the two aspects are illustrated in the narrative form of Dickens's Bleak House. In "Esther's Narrative" the perspective is the conquest of the contingent, the establishment of order, coherence, harmony, justice; in the authorial third-person narrative, the accidental, contingent, unmanageable predominate. For the former, the past tense is used; for the other, the present tense of narration marvellously enhances the sense of the unforeseeable and uncontrollable. 45</page><page sequence="7">NOVELIFALL 1977 rative, it is what he calls "a basic category of historical apprehension (Wahrneh- mung)," without which we cannot understand human relationships.9 He links fictional and historical narrative more explicitly than Gallie, for he boldly claims that the structure of nineteenth-century historical narrative was first established by the historical novel, just as he considers the great modifications of novel- structure in this century are influencing modern historical narrative. Both Gallie and Jauss recognise that "story" is much wider than the novel, and imply that any such sub-group as the "bourgeois novel" must be distinguished by other factors than those generally required for story. They justify story as a category of the understanding, the understanding of human, social relationships. But by understanding they do not mean the reduction of these relationships to a theorem, nor even to a conclusion. The essence of the story is the process, the reader's experience of a process that is a model of some aspect of human relation- ships, during which he is constantly engaged in anticipations and surprises, wishes and setbacks, judgments that require correction, a series that is somewhat altered with every new reading and involves, like life, alternations of expectations and revisions until the ending. Its stuff is the contingent, its purpose the discovery of some coherence within the great mass of the contingent. The sort of under- standing it conveys may, like life itself, be reduced to formulated conclusions, but these can never cover the whole complexity of the experienced events and thoughts, so that the "understanding" is essentially that of experiencing through a model and imaginatively various connected human situations. I do not think this approach is contrary to that of Professor Kermode, but rather complementary; however, consideration of it might have led him to a rather different handling of the notion of "pure contingency" in his own argument. This can best be considered under a separate heading. Coherence and Incoherence It is Sartre's main theme, formulated in a more systematic and dogmatic form by Barthes (in Le degre zero), that the formal structure of the novel, like that of historical narrative, falsifies the very essence of reality as we experience it, since it establishes connexion and coherence whereas in reality events, even psycho- logical events, are random and inscrutable. Living always in the present, we live in a jumble of pure contingency. As we have seen, Kermode defends the novel and its fictions against the imputation of falsification, but he does not seem to take exception to such definitions of life as "pure contingency," and adopts them himself-e.g. he asks "How to do justice to a chaotic, viscously contingent reality?" (p. 145) Can one be content with such statements, and with the resulting contrast established between life and art? Such statements are not meant to arise from the lack of a metaphysical mean- ingfulness in the universe; throughout this argument we are only concerned with the secular human and physical world (even though we can suspect that the 9 H. R. Jauss, Literaturgeschichte als Provokation (Suhrkamp: 1970), p. 228. 46</page><page sequence="8">ROY PASCAL NARRATIVE FICTIONS bitter indictment of the incoherence of the world arises originally from a religious disillusionment). As a statement regarding the physical and human world, we can only answer that in it there are evidently vast coherences, formu- lated in a series of laws, that constitute our environment and make life possible. There are also anomalies, incoherences and obscurities in the physical universe, but our failure to create a fully coherent order does not negate the coherences observed. In organic life, to the physical laws are added biological, which establish not only the conditions governing the existence of organic forms, but also intro- duce teleological laws, since here certain individual characteristics are functions of a biological purpose, notably the maturing of the individual and the preserva- tion of the species. In human beings, to these physical and biological patterns are added complex relationships between biological, psychological, and social systems and events. If it is extremely difficult to formulate what laws govern such coherences, that they exist is attested by our behaviour, for we found our daily lives and expectations on the assumption of such coherences. If we did not know that certain results are likely to follow from certain types of circumstances, attitudes, and behaviour, we could not exist, as individuals or families or societies. Why repeat such cliches? Much hangs upon their acceptance or rejection, and because of this Michael Frayn, an ingenious and intelligent novelist, devotes to such considerations and their implications a number of the reflexions in his book Constructions.l' On several occasions he comments on the contrast between the orderliness of the novel and the disorderliness of reality. The world of the novel, he writes, "is enclosed. . . not open to the incomprehensibility of the real present and the uncertainty of the real future" (No. 214). But when he considers not just our immediate experience, but the whole context in which it stands, he is not content with this simple contrast. He recognises that the universe as a whole, like its parts, exhibits both coherence and incoherence. "Is there an order in the universe?" he asks, to give the disarming answer, "There are orders. And disorders" (No. 233). However, such a statement is far too general and abstract to be of immediate help, and it only sets the framework for what most interests Frayn. This is the inherent need of all living organisms to impose an order, as it were, on their universe, that is, to filter out of the chaotic complexity of their environment and of change that which promotes their own growth and survival. "We are significance-seeking organisms. We seek out significance from our environment as we seek out food" (No. 6). From the simplest perceptions and actions to the most complicated mental operations, we construct some coherence, some pattern, that enables us to register experience in a form we can put to use. Language itself is the means to such an ordering, for by language we impose connexions and coherence for the sake of securing purposeful communication (Nos. 185-6, 290). Now, this might ring a little like Barthes, and indeed in a preface to Bruce Morrissette's Les romans de Robbe-Grillet (1963) Barthes did write that it is a 10 Michael Frayn, Constructions, (New York: British Book Center, 1974). This book has no pagination. It consists of a collection of separate reflexions, each numbered. I give in my text the numbers of the re- flexions referred to. 47</page><page sequence="9">NOVEL FALL 1977 fault to believe that, in life, things remain "mute," by which he means detached from us, unrelated, contingent, for "anthropologiquement les choses signifient tout-de-suite." But Frayn differs from Barthes-the Barthes of Le degre zero-in two essentials. First, this imposition of patterns, of coherence is not contrary to reality, it is a condition of existence altogether; it is not a fraud, since there is no contrasting way of truth or honesty, there is no other way of being and thinking. Second, the imposition of patterns in art corresponds to that in life, and therefore it cannot be called "bourgeois," since it is required for all forms of social life. Therefore, when Frayn considers the patterning that narrative requires, his theme is that it may in some respects come into collision with our sense of life, when new types of narrative structure have to be invented (Mr. Frayn himself has essayed a novel written in the future tense)." But a novel would be untrue to the reality of living were it without coherences, just as it would be so were it without contingencies. Fictions and Reality The lines of approach illustrated by the work of Gallie and Frayn reveal the inadequacy and fragility of some of the assumptions and arguments of Sartre and Barthes, but do not reach as far as the more general theory of fictions with which Professor Kermode refuted their claims. In this more general field, the most pertinent contribution that I have come across is that in Moritz R. Cohen's manual, A Preface to Logic, a short section of which is devoted to a criticism of Vaihinger's The Philosophy of As-If.12 Cohen does not reject the concept of fictions, but criticises Vaihinger's interpretation, in particular his failure to recognise their connexion with reality. With all aspects of his criticism I am not concerned in our context, only with those that clarify my own criticisms (un- fortunately Cohen, like other philosophers, does not deal explicitly with literary fictions). Vaihinger, like a typical positivist, Cohen writes, accepts only the concrete and individual as real, and therefore characterises the abstract as unreal. His error is to have failed to understand that reality is not made up of separate, unrelated things, but of "things-in-relation"; "propositions about abstractions and abstract relations no more falsify reality than do propositions about par- ticulars." Fictions tacitly entail such propositions, but what, in many of them, seems to Vaihinger a puzzle is resolved when we understand that they refer to relationships, not things. Thus the mathematical zero or infinity do not stand for a particular identity, but indicate a mathematical relationship, as real as a finite number. Vaihinger's error led him to claim that fictions were "contrary to reality," but this is not so. These fictions-Cohen speaks like Vaihinger about mathemati- cal, logical, legal and sociological concepts-indicate "real parts, phases, or elements of things or their relations." They are helpful to understanding precisely 11 Michael Frayn, A Very Private Life (London: Collins, 1968). 12 Moritz R. Cohen, A Preface to Logic (New York: Meridian Books, 1960), pp. 103-112. The substance of this Chapter was first published in The Journal of Philosophy, 20 (1923). The author is "the great Morris Cohen" referred to in Saul Bellow's Humboldt's Gift, from whom Humboldt "had gotten A's in philosophy." 48</page><page sequence="10">ROY PASCAL NARRATIVE FICTIONS because they do "rest on a real basis." There is, for example, nothing in reality that can be called an "economic man," there is no such political form as "pure democracy." But there are economic motives and democratic forms, and the fictional concept comes into being when we abstract these elements from the real man and real society, in which they exist in combination with many other ele- ments. Because such concepts are not arbitrary and are related to reality, they can enable the economist to understand the economic process. "The fact that certain elements always occur in conjunction with others and never in isolation is no more an argument against their reality than the fact that no one can be a brother or a creditor without being other things is an argument against the possibility of having these abstract characteristics. Science must abstract some elements and neglect others because not all things that exist together are relevant to each other." How gladly might an imaginative writer, if considering his procedures, appro- priate the last sentence for his own art, substituting "art" or "the understanding" for "science"! Cohen's observations are indeed helpful when we are discussing the structural fictions of the novel. Coherence, retrospective perspective, insight into feelings and thoughts, endings, etc. embody features of real life and experi- ence, though these features may not exist in isolation from other elements, and may never have the pure form they have in art. Thus, the fulfilment ending is not contrary to life; we know innumerable partial and provisional endings, in personal and social life, which constitute the closure of a series of outer and inner events; the coherence between the events of a novel or in the behaviour of persons reflects the much more imperfect coherences that we encounter or try to establish in life; the role of the narrator, his insight into his characters, has its models in actual life, where we do know quite a lot about what is going on within other people, where we can often anticipate consequences, and where retrospection is a constantly used instrument of understanding. The novelistic fictions are not, as Vaihinger says and Kermode seems to re-affirm, "contrary to reality" or "arbitrary deviations from reality," they are abstractions, projections of actual relationships isolated from some of the associations with which in real life they are bound, and which are thought by the novelist to be irrelevant to his immediate object. Thus there is no antithesis of "truth" and "effectiveness" in regard to fictions; their effectiveness, usefulness, depends on the fact that they embody an aspect of reality. That fictions also have a subjective source is of course clear, and I need add nothing on this aspect of them to what Vaihinger and Kermode have written. A simple example of this dual nature, objective and subjective, of fictions can be found in the practical tools that man invents and uses. A wood-plane reflects the character of the hand and body of the workman, the physical situation in which it is to be used, and the purposes of the worker. But it also reflects, embodies, the nature of the material it is intended for, wood, in the character of the cutting edge, and perhaps the plane's whole shape is modified according, for instance, to whether it is to be used with the grain or across it. If we understand that fictions possess an attachment to reality as well as to the 49</page><page sequence="11">NOVELIFALL 1977 subjective purpose, we can more readily see that it is as erroneous to believe that fictions can be dispensed with as to believe they are misleading. Sartre and Barthes express great admiration for the works of Kafka, in which an "opaque" hero moves in an inscrutable, uninterpretable world of pure contingency. They have of course every right to admire Kafka. But they are wrong to believe that in his novels the narrative fictions are dispensed with; for the Kafka-type hero, with his lack of "character," obscurity of purpose, and extreme alienation, and his dislocated, incoherent world, are no less fictional, distinct from real life, than, say, the characters and world of Thomas Mann's Death in Venice or The Magic Mountain. Like all other novels, both types are built upon fictional constructs, themselves related to features of real existence. As such, one can appreciate both, though anyone may well prefer one to the other as corresponding to a more urgent and relevant feature of the modern situation. Cohen's criticism of Vaihinger provides a basis for my own dissatisfaction with Kermode's theory of the narrative fictions. It does not affect Kermode's main purpose and argument, especially his criticism of the modernist rejection of fictions, and his definition of fictions as instruments, as distinct from interpreta- tions. This justification of the fictitious nature of narrative structure remains extremely valuable. Also valuable is Kermode's insistence that the history of the novel from the beginning is an unremitting process of modification of fictional forms, and his ascription of these changes to the artist's urge to "make sense of the world," an urge known to his own generation as the search for authenticity. But my criticism of his rather indecisive views on the relation of the fictions to reality, if it does not challenge these important insights, is itself not a mere pedantic cavil. First, if we understand that the narrative fictions are shaped out of real features of reality, it helps us to understand why they can be used from generation to generation, for centuries, as a means to illuminate and discuss real life; like the great literary genres, epic, drama, lyric, they are rooted in our existence. Second, it helps us to understand how modifications of the fictions come about. For we should look for their source not merely in a rather tautological changed sense of life, but ultimately in the changing world that men create, the changing human relations and values that accompany changes in economic forms, in thought, in social structure and political relationships. The investigation of the changing sense of what constitutes an ending to a novel, or of Sartre's sharpened aware- ness of contingency, would have to reach into the whole world in which the novel functions, and would properly have something of the complexity that so complex a question requires. And lastly, it might restrain some of the more extravagant and arbitrary attempts at replacing older fictions with more authentic-or at least would provide the readers with some defence against arbitrary innovations. 50</page></plain_text>
