<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHAKING THE FOUNDATION: LIBERATION THEOLOGY IN NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS Sharon Carson Theologian and historian Vincent Harding, in his study There Is a River, argues that over the course of his abolitionist career, Frederick Douglass failed to pose a genuinely radical challenge to nineteenth- century slaveholding America. Harding argues that Douglass failed to extend his condemnation of slavery to a more systematic and struc- tural critique of American society: It was possible to say that Douglass's failure to openly advocate insurrection was further evidence of the limits of his radicalism, but far more important was his continued unwillingness to recognize the fact that the slaveholder was only one element in the system of slavery. He could not - or would not - sharpen and maintain those occasional radical insights which at times had led him to see the involvement of the American people, the American institutions, and the American government in the steel-like web of racism, exploitative economics, and fear which formed the basic undergirding of slavery. For it was not the call to armed insurrection which was the hallmark of antebellum black radical- ism, but a careful, sober capacity to see the entire American government, and the institutions and population which it represented, as the basic foe of any serious black struggle, whatever form it might take. It was America, not simply slaveholders, which needed to be transformed, and above all the gov- ernment and its institutions. (200) It is the purpose of this essay to show that in his 1845 Narrative Douglass does make a sustained radical challenge, both theologically and by extension politically, to nineteenth-century slaveholding Chris- tianity.1 In this confrontation, Douglass's liberation theology shakes the foundation of one of the primary undergirding social, political and economic structures of nineteenth-century American culture - the R&amp;L 24.2 (Summer 1992) 19</page><page sequence="2">20 Religion &amp; Literature white Christian churches. In Narrative, Douglass develops his radical critique through a sharply honed rhetorical progression that shifts from subtle to explicit claims of religious authority. His accelerating indict- ment of American society moves from vague allusions to a guiding "providence" to a concluding full appropriation of New Testament authority. Through irony, Douglass invites white Christian readers into familiar territory, then radically rearranges the theological land- scape. Through metaphor, he powerfully and symbolically indicts mainstream Christianity at its foundation. He affirms the power of "the root" (African tradition) in synthesis with an authentic Judeo- Christianity. His language in places suggests "sanctified" violence as a necessary black response to abusive white culture. In a literary act of self-definition that had, in itself, radical implica- tions in the America of 1845, Douglass claims ultimate authority for his own religious (and political) experience: he claims the black com- munity as a sanctified location for authentic Christianity and he effec- tively dismantles any claim to sanctified authority by "the Christianity of this land." Douglass marks out radical holy ground. Drawing on the religious life of the black community and his own experience, he sets new boundaries for the presence of the sacred in American history. Douglass's first direct religious reference occurs as a challenge to the argument that "God cursed Ham and therefore American slavery is right" (257). Since the beginning of North American slavery in the 1600s, white Americans had used this scriptural argument to rational- ize and sanctify the enslavement of Africans and African- Americans.2 Douglass challenges this rationalization by first making explicit the fact that many slaves, himself included, are the offspring of white fathers and black mothers, thus fracturing the racial boundaries so critical to the theologies of white Christians.3 He then uses the force of "scrip- ture" to give authority to his rejection of the "curse of Ham" theo- logical argument: Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves [slaves of mixed-race parentage]. It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the in- evitable laws of population. Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their increase will do no other good, it will do away with the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right. If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally en- slaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural. . . . (257, my emphasis)</page><page sequence="3">SHARON CARSON 21 This passage is typical of the early religious references in Narrative. Unlike earlier spiritual autobiographers (e.g. Jarena Lee) or religious- political writers (e.g. David Walker), Douglass here refers to scripture and the authority of God ironically and "in passing" rather than by means of explicit biblical quotation. But scripture provides the foun- dation for his rhetoric; he introduces religious language ("prophecy," "scriptural," "unscriptural") in a way that assumes the authority of the Bible in his rejection of slavery. Without being specific, his language casts back to and affirms some sense of "scripture" as authentic and authoritative. In this passage he explicitly rejects white religious argu- ments regarding the "curse of Ham"; by extension, he condemns as an incorrect reading of scripture this specific theological "truth" claimed by some white Christians, and he rejects the validity of systematic oppression based on that truth. Slave songs gave expression to the spiritual experience of African- American slaves, and in an extended description Douglass claims the songs as "testimony," as a "prayer to God." (He also compresses hermeneutic theory into one refreshingly short phrase): I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and ap- parently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bit- tersweet anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. (263, my emphasis) The religious language here strongly associates profound human objections to slavery with an appeal to deliverance by God. Slave songs, as prayer, express spiritual pain and appeal. All through this powerful passage, Douglass repeats and emphasizes a religious frame for the songs, suggesting their "sanctified" status as prayer, their content as part of a communion with God. What is the content of these prayers? They assert an objection to slavery at the deepest level of human ex- perience. Prayer is resistance. Prayer is an existential link between the slave and the holy. There is, however, another rhetorical and theological move here that suggests a dependence on the intervention of an anthropomorphic God into the realm of secular events - a call for deliverance through the "breaking in" of the sacred to secure the liberation of human be- ings in history. It is partly because of this seemingly passive theological stance that Harding questions Douglass's radicalism. Does his "waiting" for divine intervention constitute a fundamental refusal to see human -</page><page sequence="4">22 Religion &amp; Literature historical - action as the primary agent of radical social change? Does belief, in this sense, inspire a reformist rather than revolutionary at- titude, a failure of radical vision? Douglass first explicitly invokes the authority of an intervening God to support his own experience and his position on slavery when he describes, in strong prophetic tone, his sense of being "marked," of being called to resist slavery "by a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor": Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifesta- tion of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. I regarded the selection of myself as being some- what remarkable. There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore. There were those younger, those older, and those of the same age. / was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last, and only choice. I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor. But I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed the opinion. I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of insuring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false and incur my own abhorrence. From my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom. This good spirit was from God, and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise. (273, my emphasis) Here Douglass uses religious language that would resonate in the con- sciousness of nineteenth-century Christian readers, especially those in Protestant denominations: "plain manifestation of that kind providence," "selection," "special interposition," "Providence," "deep convictions," "living word of faith and spirit of hope," "ministering angels," "thanks- giving and praise." In fact, the passage ends in a sermon style of praise, exhortation and prayer. White Christian readers are pulled into familiar territory, but Douglass realigns their usual associations with this religious language and imagery. In his direct reference to the spirit of God, he claims divine authority and religious sanctification for not only his opposition to slavery, but more important, for his own life, for his self-definition over and against any other definitions proffered to him by white society. In analyzing this passage, Harding has suggested that Douglass's belief in Providence ("this mysterious divine opening of the blank walls of slavery," as Harding puts it) allowed him to step back from the more radical implications of his critique of slavery. Says Harding</page><page sequence="5">SHARON CARSON 23 in relation to the passage: "These were not ideal words, nor written simply to appeal to his evangelical Protestant readers. Douglass was not deeply involved in organized religion, neither while in slavery nor as a free man, but he did imbibe intensely of the nineteenth-century understanding of Providence, of the rational, loving, guiding hand of the Divine. This religious conviction was of great importance, for it brought to his thought and life what might be called a radical hope, a strange and mysterious faith that was a two-edged sword" (148). In Harding's view, this two-edged sword consisted of one sharper blade cutting to the core of absolute human equality, cutting a divine base for Douglass's prophetic, jeremiad warning to white Americans who violated that equality. The other edge was a duller blade: a faith in Providence that neutralized the impulse toward radical response to racial injustice. By assuming the eventual and favorable intervention of a righteous God, the sharpness of a radical prophetic voice was cor- roded, worn away. Harding sees this faith in Providence as providing hope, but also providing potential ground for a failure of radical vision, if human action were deferred in hope of divine intervention. (Zora Neale Hurston would later confront the political perils of passive and mumbling, rumbling people in Moses, Man of the Mountain.) In this passage of Narrative, Douglass's sentiment of "selection" is, I think, politically sharper than Harding's general critique of Douglass would grant. The fundamental claim here is nothing less than that of absolute religious authority for African-American experience in ante- bellum America. In the second part of the extended section quoted above, Douglass defines himself over and above the "ridicule of others," an assertion that carries special force within a slave narrative aimed at a primarily white audience. He grounds his assertion of self in the authority of God, and trusts his own religious experience as against that of white Christians. Through his closing reference to "minister- ing angels," Douglass casts his own spiritual experience into the messianic shadow of Psalm 91 and Matthew 4. From a Christian per- spective, Douglass's associating himself with the messianic authority of Christ has profound theological and political implications. Such a claim, in itself, is a profound act of resistance to a slaveholding culture that claims a Christian foundation. It is at this existential turning point in Narrative that Douglass intensifies his indictment of white mainstream Christianity. He still weaves subtle associative references to scripture into his argument, but accelerates and makes more explicit his theo- logical condemnation of Americans who claim to be Christians while "sanctifying" slavery. In doing so, he begins a sustained structural critique that Harding</page><page sequence="6">24 Religion &amp; Literature has criticized him for lacking. Harding's challenge to Douglass seems to suggest that radicalism must be framed, at all levels, in explicitly political terms. In a basic sense, this is true, since radical critiques by their very nature point to foundational cracks in society's architecture; such critiques are inherently political in their implications. But political thinking need not be always expressed in explicitly political language, and it is in this sense that Douglass's 1845 liberation theology does take a radical stance. Douglass's accelerating theological critique dismantles any religious justification for slavery and builds to an eventual meta- phoric call for action, including violent action if need be. He uses a theological base for a broader political challenge, one that extends from word (including Word) to action. And he begins this acceleration by attributing - and appropriating -a righteous rage to that same "inter- vening" God. It is after a long and moving description of the fate of his grand- mother, abandoned and left alone in the woods by her owners, that Douglass first appeals to the avenging anger of a just God - an appeal that makes explicit a nineteenth-century African- American understand- ing of Hebrew scripture. Here Douglass responds to the emotional loss of a family member with a call for justice from a God who inter- venes across generations: My poor grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve children, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers. She stands - she sits - she staggers - she falls - she groans - she dies - and there are none of her children or grandchildren present, to wipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains. Will not a righteous God visit for these things? (284, my emphasis) This passage puts African- American history into sharp focus. Through the metaphorical image of his suffering grandmother, Douglass con- fronts the cross-generational suffering of his people, a breaking of generational bonds that makes some gestures, some action, at times impossible. Douglass places responsibility for that suffering squarely in the hands of his "old master." The grandmother has provided the foundation for his economic prosperity ("She had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had be- come a great grandmother in his service" [283]), and by extension, for the political and social power held by the master. As Douglass demon- strates later in Narrative, in his attack on the complicity of the Northern churches in perpetuating slaveholding Christianity, he is acutely aware that the "slaveholder" is a type for white American society as a whole. In his closing sentence here, Douglass appeals to God's active justice.</page><page sequence="7">SHARON CARSON 25 There is no reason to presume that Douglass precludes the possibility that the form of that intervention would be through human action. He is, himself, "called" by God in his own work as an abolitionist. Early African- American religion often fused remnants of a vital African religious world view with biblical accounts of the struggles of Israel, as recounted in Hebrew scripture.4 Douglass shares with many nineteenth-century African- American writers this "casting-back" to the trials and liberation of Israel as an authorizing story, a religious framework for understanding experience and focusing social action. References to Hebrew scripture dominate other works more than they do Narrative (e.g. David Walker's Appeal) but Douglass sharpens his own religious argument in this section in a significant way: he shifts from claiming the authority of a vaguely defined Providence to claim- ing the authority of an active Judeo-Christian God. And as in Exodus, the intervention of God is worked out in the actions of human beings. Judeo-Christian scripture and theology do not always counsel passiv- ity. In fact, as Narrative progresses, Douglass sharpens his theological critique by appropriating the language of the New Testament, chal- lenging white American Christians by using "their" language in his terms. He invites his readers to walk a familiar landscape, then shifts the ground beneath their feet. Such a rhetorical challenge is a deeply political act, carrying with it the force of structural challenge to an American society still largely dominated by the rhetoric of Judeo- Christian authority. Narrative eventually moves to the important story of Douglass's en- counter with Mr. Covey, which I read as a deeply metaphoric chal- lenge to white slaveholding Christianity - one in which Douglass sug- gests radical response, including violence, to slavery. First, we meet Mr. Covey: Added to the natural good qualities of Mr. Covey, he was a professor of reli- gion-a pious soul - a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church. All this added weight to his reputation as a "nigger-breaker." (289) This ironic introduction, with its explicit reference to Covey's position in the white community, prepares the reader for an extended account of the whippings and abuses that Covey heaps upon his slaves. Then comes a description of Covey which constructs a metaphoric portrait of the white church: Mr. Covey's forte consisted in his power to deceive. His life was devoted to plan- ning and perpetuating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made conform to his disposition to deceive.</page><page sequence="8">26 Religion &amp; Literature He seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty. He would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and strange as it may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he. The exer- cises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me. He would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at times do so; at others, I would not. My non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion. To show himself independent of me, he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner. In this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor man: such was his disposition, and success at deceiving. I do verily believe that he sometimes de- ceived himself into the solemn belief, that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery. (292) This long passage can be read, at every line, as a portrayal of white slaveholding Christianity: self-deception, a preoccupation with visible signs of piety, feeble expressions of spirituality, hymns profoundly out of tune, discordance created in the tension between the church and the "challenge" of slavery, and abuse meted to "outsiders" while the church simultaneously claims the highest religious and moral ground. Again, the slaveholder and the slaveholding church become types for the broader political and social realities of nineteenth-century Amer- ican society: a deluded rhetoric of freedom, discordance created in the tension between the democratic ideology of the Republic and the reality of slavery. Later Douglass expresses the consequence of such virulent hypocrisy in deeply personal terms. He is, for a time, subdued in the confronta- tion, "broken in body, soul and spirit" by abuse, dehumanized and drained of spiritual strength. It is only on the Sabbath, in a restless arbor sanctuary, that he regains spiritual ground, and then only momentarily: Sunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in sort of a beast-like stupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times I would rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul, accompanied with a faint beam of hope, that flickered for a moment, and then vanished. I sank down again (293) Clearly, the Sabbath (and the sacred) alone is not enough; is not, in itself, an adequate reservoir from which to draw the strength necessary for action. Douglass must rally himself. Here, in fact, he doubts the existence of a God who would have allowed him to be born a slave, even as he seems momentarily to resort to an appeal to that same God for his deliverance: "O God, save me: God, deliver me:</page><page sequence="9">SHARON CARSON 27 Let me be free: Is there any God? Why am I a slave?" There is no answer to this prayer or to this question, so Douglass immediately asserts himself as the agent of his freedom: I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear, I'll try it. ... I have only one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free: Try it? Yes: God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water. (294) Yes, Providence will still help him, but Douglass stands clearly here as the acting force in his own liberation. He does not ultimately deny God, but neither does he accept a passive stance and wait for a free- dom delivered from an external source. Douglass reasserts his own spirituality and his will toward freedom. His brokenness is temporary; his despair motivates and sparks his protest, and his protest gives him hope as he struggles against hopelessness. Having regained his spiritual resolve, Douglass proceeds to recount his decision to fight Covey. An important passage occurs immediately prior to the physical confrontation, as Douglass is being sent back to Covey after pleading with Master Thomas for release from Covey's abuse. As he returns to Covey's farm, Douglass stops overnight with another slave: I found Sandy an old advisor. He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey: but that before I went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was a certain root, which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it always on my right side, would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me. . . . To please him, I at length took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it upon my right side. This was Sunday morning. I immediately started for home; and upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his way to meeting. He spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by, and passed on towards the church. Now, this singular conduct of Mr. Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in the root which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half in- clined to think the root to be something more than I had at first taken it to be. All went well until Monday morning. On this morning, the virtue of the root was fully tested. (297, Douglass's emphasis) In meeting with Sandy, Douglass encounters the way of the "folk," the spiritual base (the "root") of African religious experience that has persisted through the African diaspora into America. Here, Douglass affirms a religious authority that is outside a Judeo-Christian frame- work and portrays the root as a possible source ("from whence the</page><page sequence="10">28 Religion &amp; Literature spirit came I don't know" [298]) for his determination to physically fight with Covey. With the root firmly tied to his side, Douglass uses force for the first time. When Covey strikes him, Douglass strikes back, fighting blow with blow and winning, both physically and psychologically. Through violence, Douglass has subdued violence and protected himself. In a confrontation where the "language" of violence was initiated by Covey, Douglass has "spoken" in his own terms. Those terms include the power of the root. Some religious historians have argued that very little, if any, of traditional African religious practice persisted into the later years of African- American slave experience.5 Others claim that slave religion fused African practices and beliefs to "New World" Judeo-Christianity.6 This section in Narrative strongly suggests the latter interpretation. In a personal narrative framed in Judeo-Christian imagery and author- ity, we find an interlude of potent spirituality, a testimony to "the virtue of the root," a testimony to the persisting power of tradition outside of Judeo-Christian frameworks. Even in a complex fusion of African and Judeo-Christian religions, the power of the "root" persists. The "root" fundamentally alters the nature of Douglass's participation in Judeo-Christian "tradition." Through the synthesis, Douglass gains his final liberation from Covey, and by extension, confronts the abusive precepts of a failed Christianity in profoundly spiritual terms. Houston Baker has offered a sharply contrasting reading of the root in this scene: "What is represented by the introduction of Sandy Jenkins is a displacement of Christian metaphysics by Afro- American 'superstition.' Ultimately, this displacement reveals the inefficacy of trusting solely to any form of extrasecular aid for relief (or release) from slavery. The root does not work. The physical confrontation does" (46-47). But to assert such a definitive separation of the meta- physical from the physical denies the degree to which spirituality con- ditions "secular" experience. In other words, the root (the spiritual) becomes fused with action - the physical act of resistance becomes an incarnation, so to speak, of Douglass's appropriation of the sacred, in both its Judeo-Christian and African forms. It is especially significant that the root helps liberate Douglass from Covey's violence. He does not turn the other cheek, but meets vio- lence with force. This action becomes, in turn, "the turning point" in Douglass's career as a slave (298). Violence provides the seed for his liberation. Douglass claims religious "authority" for his act of resistance from the spiritual indictment of slavery which he has carefully con- structed in Judeo-Christian terms, and from the way of the folk.</page><page sequence="11">SHARON CARSON 29 Douglass's story of the root suggests that only by bringing the way of the folk into synthesis with "New World" religious experience can slaves effectively confront "sanctified" slavery. Douglass concludes his story of Covey and this extended meta- phoric confrontation of the white church by reinforcing an explicit association between force and resurrection, between liberation and New Testament authority: The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He can only understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never felt before. It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom. (298-99, my emphasis) It is here that I think criticism of Douglass as "reformer" falters. By associating Covey not only with white slaveholders but also at a deeper level with the white churches and white American society, and by claiming a complex religious sanctiflcation for violent opposition, Douglass can be read as making a profoundly radical religious and political statement to his readers: Resist slavery by force if necessary, and thus express the will of God in human history. Later Douglass makes another association between religious author- ity and the use of force when he recounts the meeting in New Bedford which was called to deal with a black man who had tried to turn in a fugitive slave. This passage first establishes an old man as "organiz- ing" authority and sanctifies his role in the black community by hav- ing him lead the prayer. This done, the old man claims force (in this case, murder) as the appropriate response to a black man's betrayal of another fugitive slave: The people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appoint- ing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows: "Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door, and kill him\* (324, my emphasis) Douglass carefully authorizes this "forceful" response to the betrayer. Although the angry crowd tries to follow the old man's instructions, "they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves" (324, my emphasis). Despite this interference, the threat of death works: betrayal of fugitive slaves stops. By letting the culprit survive through the actions of others, Douglass refrains from directly advocating murder as a broadly acceptable tactic in the war against slavery. But his story here does suggest that violence, even in its most extreme form, has a "sanctified" place in the fight.</page><page sequence="12">30 Religion &amp; Literature As Narrative has unfolded, Douglass has moved from "kind provi- dence" to "Providence," to a God resonating Hebrew scripture, to the power of the "root," and finally now to the explicit authority of the New Testament. He makes his first direct quotation from the New Testament (Matthew 25.35) as he "sanctifies" the abolitionist efforts of Nathan Johnson. What is significant here is that this first explicit New Testament "authority" appears to sanctify a free black man: "I was hungry, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger, and he took me in" (324). Quoting from the parable of the sheep and the goats, Douglass places Johnson among those who "sit on the right," and in doing so, locates authentic Chris- tianity in the black community. He sets up this opposition between the black "true church" and false Christianity earlier in Narrative also, with his account of the hidden bible school, where slaves secretly study and pray at hazard to their physical safety, and white "Chris- tians" remain oblivious (303-4). Now with this explicit act of biblically sanctifying Nathan Johnson, Douglass claims ultimate religious author- ity for the free and self-defined black community. Narrative closes with a jeremiad appendix in which Douglass con- demns "the Christianity of this land" in absolute terms. Here his struc- tural critique of American society is explicit and uncompromised. The corrupt slaveholding Christianity of the South is not just a regional blight upon the land, but is, "by communion and fellowship, the reli- gion of the north" (329). It is, finally, the religion of the nation, and as such, is a cornerstone of American social, economic and political life. Under Douglass's rhetorical attack, the cornerstone cracks, the house shakes. Douglass again invokes New Testament authority, but first he marks a distinction between holy and corrupt Christianity: Between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recog- nize the widest possible difference - so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women- whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypo- critical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels. (326) This passage is unambiguous. Douglass asserts his religious definition as authoritative for the nation. He follows this with a sharpened</page><page sequence="13">SHARON CARSON 31 indictment of the relationship between the corrupt churches and the economic structures of American society: "The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday . . . the slave dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garbs of Christianity" (327). And after appropriating Christ's authority in an extended attack against the "Pharisees" of the land, Douglass re- emphasizes the broad sweep of his condemnation: "Dark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America. They strain at a gnat, and swallow a earner (328). He closes this remarkable jeremiad with the very words of Jeremiah: "Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?" (329) Again, there is an activism in Douglass's indictment that extends far beyond a passive trust in God's intervention. He states his active commitment to the now sanctified anti-slavery cause in the closing lines of Narrative, ending with emphasis on his own intent and action, in the context of a religious self and social understanding: Sincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something toward throwing light on the American slave system, and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds - faithfully relying on the power of truth, love, and justice, for success in my humble efforts - and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause, - / subscribe myself, Frederick Douglass. (331, my emphasis) This closing posture of humility should not be misinterpreted as diluting the authority (religious and political) that Douglass has claimed throughout Narrative. With humble phrasing, Douglass closes with a sanctifying assertion of "the power of truth, love, and justice" behind his voice. Narrative as a whole is rhetorical testimony to this sanctifica- tion, carefully orchestrated to build in intensity, working in both sub- tle undercurrents and full onrushes of religious imagery and language. Douglass condemns mainstream Christianity as the spiritual under- girding of a corrupt slaveholding society. He draws clear connections, both metaphorical and explicit, between religion and the primary insti- tutions of the nation. He ultimately locates "true" religious authority in himself and in the black community. He grants absolute authority to his own religious interpretations against those of "the Christianity of this land." For a writer with a religious world view, this theological authority is foundational to all other cultural experience. For a black</page><page sequence="14">32 Religion &amp; Literature writer in antebellum America, there could be no more profound or radical a challenge to white-defined "Christian" culture. I have argued in this essay that as a literary work, Narrative poses a radical challenge to American society, and I have offered this as evi- dence for Douglass's early radicalism. The reading here, however, leaves unaddressed the issue of Douglass's extension of his "word" into continued action. Harding recounts episodes just before and after the publication of Narrative where the contradictory nature of Douglass's radicalism becomes apparent in his conflict with other black activists. Douglass objects to (and votes against) Henry Highland Garnet's Ad- dress to the Slaves of the United States , a speech delivered to the 1843 black convention in Buffalo (143). The force of the speech is "By any means necessary," and Douglass objected that there was "too much physical force" implied in Garnet's call to action. Douglass also disagreed with Martin Delany over tactics when Delany proposed the following at the 1848 National Convention of Colored Freemen, in Cleveland: "Whereas we find ourselves far behind the military tactics of the civilized world, Resolved that this Convention recommend to the colored Freemen of North America to use every means in their power to obtain that science, so as to enable them to measure arms with assailants without and invaders within" (150). The resolution was voted down. As Harding points out, Douglass also made other calls to radical action, especially in the newspapers he produced after his split with Garrisonian abolitionism. North Star (1847), says Harding, was "pure Douglass. A basic, vital force constantly surged forth - a language, a rhetoric of action and warfare. But the action, the militancy, and the warfare were essentially confined to the word and focused in Douglass, the spokesman for the people; they were not expressed in a cadi for ubiquitous movement by the people, for self-liberating deeds emerg- ing out of the radical presence of the total community" (147). Clearly, Narrative's radical critique and unambiguous association of physical force with resurrection were ambiguously projected into Douglass's political work. Tension about violence is inherent in any radical movement for social change. Diverse black communities of antebellum America struggled with the question of force throughout the pre-war period, and beyond, into Reconstruction and into the twentieth century. Whether Judeo-Christian faith generally, or a specific belief in the eventual (or present) intervention of a God who acts in human history</page><page sequence="15">SHARON CARSON 33 was - and is - a deterrent to radical social action remains an open ques- tion. Clearly, it need not necessarily be so, but the question touches the broader question of reconciling Judeo-Christian religious belief with the use of "liberating" force to achieve political ends. Vincent Harding's overall analysis of nineteenth-century African- American history does raise the issue in compelling and challenging terms. There Is a River also analyzes this nation's continued failure to make the deep structural changes necessary to achieve racial justice, with a critical thoroughness that will productively challenge readers from any tradi- tion of radical "liberation theology." Did Douglass's later political activity renounce his early radical vision? Was he unable to move, in uncompromised terms, from this early "word" to action, from literary act to political act? Did he move away from these early radical insights and come to see slavery as a "particularly" flawed edifice built upon America's otherwise structurally sound foundation? Douglass rewrote his own history in subsequent versions of his autobiography (My Bondage and My Freedom , 1855; Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, 1892), and these later documents offer us his unfolding "revision" of himself, his religious self-understanding, and his analysis of American society. These later narratives also offer insight into the perils to "principle" that await us in the turbulent arenas of political activism. Frederick Douglass, more than most human beings, committed his writing and his life to principle and to activism. Vincent Harding, too, infuses his scholarship with an activist's insight and commitment. We are reminded in the work of both that the literary act, in itself, is not enough.
