Pictured is a unique comb; both in original, and restored con- dition. This artifact was found at the Smith-Pagerie site, in Fulton county, New York. Although these artifacts accompany cultural remains of several Woodland traditions such as "Point Peninsula", Virginia Hopewell, and others; this example belongs to the Garoga complex. The design reflects Middle Woodland influence in that there are two birds, symmetrically op- posed, with anthropomorphic masks in a band across the neck regions. The basic design of these combs is certainly prehistoric in its derivation, and not something picked up from early settlers. Similar combs were used by the Eastern Middle Woodland or Hopewell as previously mentioned. â–  101</page></plain_text>
