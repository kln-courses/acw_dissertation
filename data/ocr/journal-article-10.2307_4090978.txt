''-</page><page sequence="2">Af (overleaf) North facade with library entrance at right In 1974, the Commissioner and the Board of Directors of the Chicago Public Library, through an interview process, selected my firm to design a new library for the blind and the physically handi- capped. Until that time, such special purpose facilities had been housed in the basement of a branch library on the northwest side of Chicago, staffed by approximately 25 people. The funds for such a project were to be provided by both the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois. Before choosing an architect, the board had selected a site-an isosceles triangle, purchased from the city of Chicago's Department of Urban Renewal, on the near west side of the city, diago- nally across the street from the Chicago Circle Campus of the University of Illinois. The site is to be freestanding in perpetu- ity, in a park-like setting with a high school on one side and a high-rise public housing apartment complex on the other. The diagonal street will eventually be closed and converted into a pedestrian mall connecting the housing development with the library. The Chicago Public Library retained a consultant to analyze its needs and to establish a functional program for the proposed building. He consulted with the staff of the existing facility and evolved a tripartite program that included: 1) a regional administrative and operations headquarters for the service network for the blind and physically handicapped of Illinois; 2) a sub-regional library servicing eligible persons in Chicago; and 3) a branch library serving non-handicapped library patrons on the near west side of the city, all to be housed in a building of no more than 32,000 square feet within an overall budget of $1,900,000 includ- ing all furnishings. Finally, the board charged our firm with collaborating with the city of Chicago's architect and his staff as we were officially to be listed as consultants to the City Architect. During the course of programming, a group from the National Federation of the Blind met irregularly with the local staff, members of the Library Board and the programmer himself, supplying in- formation from the user point of view. My first exposure to that user group oc- curred at a board meeting where they had come prepared to attack certain policies established by the Library of Congress. It seems that, since braille books are so voluminous, the old meth- od of organizing book storage (the Dewey decimal system) has been replaced by a numerical accessions system, wherein each book (regardless of subject matter) chronologically follows the one preceding it. Thus, a closed stack system is the only logical method of book storage. The Library of Congress, in its infinite wis- dom, has thereby suggested that browsing is an intellectual matter, and as such, open stacks are unnecessary since such browsing can be conducted in card cata- logues. Unfortunately, up until that time, the Library of Congress had not established a braille card catalogue sys- tem. Flabbergasted, the blind represent- atives of the National Federation vigor- ously attacked those policies at the meeting. They were as militant and as hard-hitting as any inner city citizens group I have ever come in contact with, but when the meeting ended these same people proceeded to bump into obstacles as they attempted to leave the unfamiliar room in a dignified show of strength. After that painful incident I was deter- mined to design the kind of building that would best, most conveniently, indeed most symbolically represent the condi- tions implicit in the program. Now, it struck me that blindness, all by itself, is a serious enough matter without a "super-serious" structure to compound the problem, and that a building might well be delivered that had spirit, wit and informality-a place one could enjoy. It also struck me that the building might possibly convey how it is used-almost anthropomorphically-so that one could sense its circulatory system-how to move through it, how it works. Now, it might require sight to perceive the nu- ances of such movement, but even the sighted would sense a formal, tactile concern for the condition of blindness if it were properly expressed. Most of the buildings I have designed have come into being very slowly-in some cases very painfully-and I am afraid that some of them show that torture. Not so the Library for the Blind and the Physically Handicapped. It was designed in a matter of a few days-</page><page sequence="3">Ground floor plan 1 entrance 2 elevator 3 circulation desk 4 listening, reading lounge l I [. [.

Northwest elevation with undulating, butt-glazed window in concrete wall (opposite, from top) Early cardboard study model of building exterior Interior view of circulation counter and 165 foot window which echoes counter's curves perhaps the result of my subjective re- sponse to that early user meeting. How- ever, I must admit that the difficult site, in combination with rigorous building and parking requirements, left very little room for willfulness. Actually, the min- imum site curiously provided the impetus for potential expansion. The programmer had established (in effect) a two story building which would have taken up the entire site. By developing a tri-level rela- tionship between stack areas and circu- lating persons, not only would two-thirds of all stacks be in proximity to immedi- ate handling (versus one-half using the programmer's method) but fully a 50 percent stack expansion zone would be made available. Functionally, the library is entered on the north at the point of a gateway to the parking lot and the loading zone. The user is immediately at a control point from which everything proceeds without the difficulties usually encoun- tered in buildings not specifically de- signed for the blind. The control is ac- complished in a number of relatively simple ways: 1) user areas are always linear, because linear plans are more easily remembered than free-standing pieces of furniture; 2) everything is built- in so that once the plan is memorized, that's it; and 3) most walls and case pieces are round-cornered since sharp corners are a potential hazard to the blind user and also because a major purpose of the building is to act as a distribution center. Book carts and gurneys can maneuver around and about without inflicting unnecessary damage to the fixed elements in the building as would occur were they hard-edged and sharp-cornered. Often, architects, when working with the blind, change from hard surfaces to soft surfaces to denote functional change. It is my contention that when hard sur- faces are deleted in favor of soft ones, another crucial sensory response (that of hearing) is lost. Rather, the Library for the Blind attempts to articulate functional and circulatory changes using formal methods as cues and clues. One of the major ways this is achieved is shown in the circulation counter. After the blind user selects a book from the braille card catalogue, he or she moves along the extension of the card catalogue, which is, in fact, the circulation counter. That counter defines the user circulation corridor, which ranges in width from three feet to five feet, the wide points denoting the locations of circulation personnel. The corridor is wider at those points to take the user out of the circu- lating aisle to avoid being bumped into by another blind person or by those in wheelchairs. There are four such circu- lation points. As the counter curves away from the corridor it simultaneously curves downward from its normal 54 inch height to 36 inches at the four points of circu- lation, thereby indicating where a book may be received. This form is further compounded by a third curve. The skirt of the counter itself accelerates its cur- vature as it moves toward the points of circulation to accommodate a person in a wheelchair by making it possible to move the wheelchair up to and then under the counter at the circulation points. This counter generates all activity in the user portion of the building and, at the same time, structures some of the symbolic aspects of the building as well. Directly opposite the user counter is a long (165 foot) window that undulates in a fashion similar to the circulation counter itself. The window is butt- glazed with silicone joints and (literally) forces the concrete wall, into which it is set in reglets, to act as a great beam with a visual depth-to-span ratio that is apparently irrational, but then, blind- ness is also irrational in a certain way. The window's undulations can be taken to mean many things, but its primary purpose is to signal the circulatory sys- tem of the user corridor-in a sense, it is the user corridor tilted up and "painted" on the elevation. The low points of the window are too low for the sighted, are clearly not intended for the blind, but</page><page sequence="6">~~~~~~SS* 7 |D # .. _ - - _ _ I , , | N.

As the circulation counter dips downward to signify loca- tion points of circulation personnel, the window curves upward, allowing those same personnel to see out of the build- ing. The wall structures one of the many "inversions" at work (symbolically speaking) in the building. (Blindness, in a certain sense, is thought of here as an "inversion.") Another inversion deals with the build- ing's coloration. The entire idea of a library for the blind finished in very bright colors is apparently curious. Cer- tainly, there are many "rational" reasons for the bright colors: 1) the "legal" defi- nition of blindness does not necessarily mean "total" blindness-the last thing a person sees before becoming totally blind is very bright color bathed in light; 2) blind people have sighted relatives and friends, who will convey the building's highly colored appearance; 3) the build- ing is located directly across the street from a bland brown brick university in an economically deprived neighborhood, in a colorless city; and 4) it suggests an informality and humor belying the seri- ous condition of the user. All of this adds up to the general intention to strike out at the overly serious way in which libraries have always conveyed their of- ten humorless, sometimes dour character. All of the perimeter walls of the building (save the hypotenuse) are of Mondrian- like, primary red color; the entire struc- tural system is primary yellow (columns, beams, diagonal bracing) and all of the software is primary blue (HVAC ducts, plumbing and electrical conduits). All exposed concrete (including most prom- inently the hypotenuse) is gray, interior partitions are white, doors and door bucks are black, floor covering is either dark gray carpeting or black studded rubber. Built-in formica case work is white, movable furniture has dark gray fabric as do all of the plastic accessories. Graphics are in both English and braille and all relief graphics (maps, etc.) are being designed for this building. The building also operates in a special way for the staff. Since its primary func- tion is that of a distribution center, and since the former headquarters of the operation was located in the basement of a branch library, and the bulk of the work was accomplished in what can only be described as factory-like condi- tions, it seemed important for the staff's morale to avoid the idea of a "back room" in the new building and to pro- mote both accidental and programmed contact between staff and users. There- fore, the entire operation is conducted in the open with users being exposed to shipping and receiving as well as to the circulation staff. The linear circulation counter is the key to all the other parts of the building. By returning along its length, and around the corner from the braille card catalogue, one is directed into a reading area with "plug-in" capabilities for talking books and cassettes. At the other end of the circulation counter are toilet facilities for the handicapped and elevator access to the library offices and meeting rooms on the second floor. The facility for the handicapped inter- faces with one of the Chicago Public Library's branch libraries also located on the second floor. That area is divided into four reading sections: pre-school, pre-teen, high school and adult, all dis- tributed around an open stack system. Finally, second floor facilities include the remainder of closed stack areas, a volunteer area for recording and braille book copying, a major electrical machine repair area for talking books and cassettes, reproduction and duplication space and a staff lounge. Structurally, the building is a fireproofed, one-way steel system of beams bearing on steel-clad, round columns carrying pre-cast concrete planks with lateral bracing taken by tension cables diago- nally disposed with turnbuckles (again fireproofed). The concrete wall-as- hypotenuse is post-tensioned with sub- stantial amounts of tempered steel to deter shrinkage cracking. The concrete wall was a major logistical effort since the pour required 250 cubic yards of concrete and over ten consecu- tive hours to complete. The other perim- eter walls are made of 1/4 inch thick (no "oil-canning" is apparent) cold-rolled, re-rolled carbon steel plate, nominally I/1__</page><page sequence="9">II ~I W _ Jr ~ r (clockwise, from top) North facade and west side with articulated gray concrete wall and second floor round windows in metal wall at light well Cardboard model and axono- metric drawing of 21-foot square staff vehicle garage now under construction</page><page sequence="10">r __ 9 '1:.# 4s'R l v _ l X S _ X/'' e _ | Z F S _ I w _ . - _ I | w ?. _ 1 r - ' _ | | , _ :.

Walls con- tinue curvalinear direction set at entrance circulation counter</page><page sequence="15">5 feet wide and 30 feet high with a jamb condition of broken metal (a 30 foot breaking press was discovered in Chicago) and caulked joints. The panels are insu- lated and backed up with sheet rock with large-scale expansion beads on the same 5 foot module to minimize internal cosmetic cracking problems due to ex- pansion and contraction of the steel panel system. A gateway to the parking lot and mail truck loading zone is established through the use of a (primarily symbolic) kiosk functionally supporting nothing more than the English and braille signage for the building and an American flag, which, together with the entrance to the build- ing itself, forms a gateway from the street. The building opens for public use in March, 1978. The entire process from beginning to end will have taken over three years and will be the first new structure designed as a library for the blind and the physically handicapped in the United States. We continue to work with the staff to correct any errors we have made as well as to accommodate continuing change in library procedures for this type of facility. Iconographically, the building is a mixed metaphor. On the one hand, referential sources from the "modern movement" in architecture abound (Corbusian, Hejdukian). On the other hand, these are often neutralized by system-referencing (red walls, gray concrete, yellow struc- ture). Metaphorical allusions are implicit in a program that is loaded with poign- ancy (blindness) rather than the current modish thinking that superimposes met- aphors on unsuspecting programs. Anthropomorphism abounds (circulatory system "printed" on the building's face and the window shape) and inversions and reversals are everywhere and nowhere (the apparently lightweight steel panels are made opaque while the apparently heavy concrete wall is made transparent through the device of the horizontal, undulating cut). Therefore, the building represents not just the specific program, nor just the general state of the art, but significantly, the author's own schizo- phrenic, inconclusive struggle with both.

Born in 1930, he received his B.A. and M.A. in architecture from Yale University and completed further studies on a Fulbright Scholarship at the Danish Graduate School for Foreign Students in Copenhagen. His own architecture practice, consisting pri- marily of the design of private residences, began in 1971. Since 1965, Mr. Niland has been design consultant to the Con- temporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, where he has designed and installed numerous exhibitions and, he has been a member of Cincinnati's Design Review Board since 1970.  Stanley Tigerman was born in Chicago in 1930. He received his architecture degrees and the Alpha Rho Chi medal from Yale University where, incidentally, he and Niland became friends. In 1964 he began his own architecture practice and his work has been published internationally in books and journals on art and archi- tecture. He has maintained a parallel career as a painter and sculptor, exhibiting frequently at museums and universities. In 1976 he was on the Progressive Architecture Design Awards Jury and in 1977 was Chairman of the AIA Insti- tute Honors Jury. A Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, Mr. Tigerman was Professor of Architecture at the Chicago Circle Campus of the University of Illinois until 1971 and is cur- rently on the Advisory Committee of the School of Architecture at Yale University.</page></plain_text>
