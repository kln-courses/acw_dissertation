<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophical Studies. By DAVID G. RITCHIE, M.A., LL.D., sometime Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in the Uni- versity of St. Andrews. Edited, with a memoir, by Prof. LATTA. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1905. Pp. ix., 355. THE interest of this volume is largely biographical, or at least per- sonal. The philosophical fragments which it contains are probably of too slight a texture to have much permanent value; but they are highly instructive as throwing a side light on the more purely speculative aspects of the thought of one who made his reputa- tion chiefly within the domain of political theory. The light thus gained is greatly augmented and strengthened by the very well written memoir--evidently a labour of love--which is contributed by Prof. Latta. The following sketch of Prof. Ritchie's personality, taken from the introductory memoir, seems singularly felicitous. 'His spiritual lineaments were like those which in some people make every portrait a disappointment. Those who knew him well will always, in recalling him, think first of the simple, indefinable charm which eludes description, a charm not genial in the com- mon sense (for he was reserved without being austere), nor flashing and wayward (for though he could coin an epigram on occasion, he shone rather than glittered), but a charm of exalted sanity, the charm of one who takes you, as it were, a few hundred feet higher in thought than you had ever been before, and gives you a' new outlook on familiar things .... It seemed to him that much error in judgment arises from making too hard a distinction between intellectual and moral virtues and defects, and he held that intel-</page><page sequence="2">102 CRITICAL NOTICES: lectual ignorance and incapacity is in great part a result of indifference to social progress, and is thus moral in its source. His own social optimism made him an ardent and incessant worker, restlessly intent on thoroughness of thinking, impatient of abstractions and hazy generalisations, and scrupulous in his endeavour to attain accuracy of statement and reference as re- gards even the minutest details. But there was no hardness in his sense of duty. It was rather a buoyant and optimistic belief, springing from his living interest in human well-being and progress. For him the whole duty of man lay not in doing good things, but in doing them well, and from this deep moral conviction there passed into his life a courtesy, gentleness and frankness that seemed instinctive in its readiness and ease.' The memoir by Prof. Latta contains also, though in brief comn- pass, a remarkably complete and thorough account of Ritchie's general philosophical position. In particular, he brings out very clearly the fundamental importance of ' the distinctions between the question of origin and that of validity, between historical and logical method, between fact and meaning, between picturing and conceiving'. 'Ritchie's whole thought was ruled by' this dis- tinction 'and by the problems which it raises, and the special value of his work lies in this, that he did not merely reiterate and defend it as an abstract principle, but skilfully applied it to concrete questions in new and original ways.' For instance, 'in his dis- cussions of the problems of logic and theory of knowledge Ritchie continually urged the necessity of holding fast to the distinction between logical questions as questions of validity and psycho- logical questions as questions of fact or origin'. But 'the problems of ethics and politics were those to which Ritchie gave the best of his thought' ; and Dr. Latta proceeds to give a very full analysis of his most fundamental concep- tions in these departments. ' He regarded it as a fundamental error to separate' ethics from politics ' or either of them from metaphysics.' 'In all Ritchie's thinking on these matters the governing idea is the conception of society. Social well-being is at once the ethical and the political ideal.' 'The validity of moral principles does not depend merely on society as fact, but ultimately proceeds from society as meaning. The ideal society, however, is not something cut off from the actual. It is the meaning of the society which appears and changes in actual history.' In this sense he emphasised 'the social ideal as the first principle of ethics and politics. This is what Ritchie meant when he preached " socialism " and described himself as a "socialist ". He was not a doctrinaire socialist, nor did he ac- cept as a whole any of the numerous socialist systems of recent times. But he believed profoundly in the socialist attitude as against any form of individualism, empirical or a priori.' ' This " socialist " belief was also the foundation of his criticismi of evolu- tionist theories in ethics and politics. They tend to ignore the</page><page sequence="3">DAVID G. RITCHIE, Philosophical Studies. 103 special characteristics of human society, which differentiate it from animal communities and which are the logical ground of ethical and political principles, by transferring biological concep- tions directly to ethics and politics.' Dr. Latta then goes on to give a very interesting account of some of Ritchie's views on the most important problems of practical ethics and politics. ' One part of practical ethics is the develop- ment or enlargement of the social ideal. And along with this there must go development in the means of realising the ideal, i.e. develop- ment of customs and institutions.' The case of marriage is taken as an illustration. "I do consider," says Ritchie himself in a letter, " that it is the business of the State (supposing a well- organised State) to regulate, if possible, the birth, and certainly the education of children so as to give them a fair chance of growing up into the best possible men and women, but that, apart from that end, the State should not interfere between fully grown indi- viduals; and that the usual opinion of society, which condemns e.g. George Eliot and has nothing but sympathy for people who cause the existence of children with inherited diseases and who have no prospect of giving them a fair education, provided only they have gone through a religious ceremony, is mischievous in the extreme." Again, we are told that Ritchie ' had little if any sympathy either with narrow nationalism on the one hand or with vague cosmopolitanism on the other. But he believed firmly in the ideal of the federation of the world, agreeing with the doctrine of Kant that a permanent general peace can never be secured by treaties between independent nations, but only by the establishment of a federation of self-governing states, in which there is ultimately one sovereignty and attempts at war become equivalent to rebellion.' Some interesting particulars are also given with regard to Ritchie's views on the referendum (of which he approved), on disestablish- ment (of which he disapproved), and on the general problems of religion and philosophy. Apart from Prof. Latta 's memoir, which is extremely interesting, the contents of this volume will probably be found by most readers somewhat disappointing and tantalising; or at least they will be best appreciated by those who consider them in close connexion with the general account of Ritchie's work and personality. Several of the papers here printed-' The Relation of Logic to Psychology,' 'The Relation of Metaphysics to Epistemology,' 'The One and the Maany' have already appeared in philosophical journals; and their value, though considerable (that on ' The One and the Many,' in particular, is written with extraordinary brilliance) is, in general, more critical than constructive. At any rate, readers of MIND have probably had opportunities of forming their own judgments on these papers before now. The other papers have, from their general nature, a more permanent interest; but their fragmentary char- acter detracts very seriously from their value. The most important is the Cogitatio Metaphysica, which is ' a general statement of his</page><page sequence="4">104 CRITICAL NOTICES: views on all the main questions of philosophy and religion '-a large subject to cover in about fifty pages. The Confessio Fidei (34 pp.) is an earlier treatise on a number of fundamental problems. The last and longest of the fragments (about 80 pp.) is entitled ' Moral Philosophy: on the Method and Scope of Ethics'. It is hardly necessary to state that all these writings are characterised by lucid and incisive exposition, and are often lighted up by illuminating (and, not infrequently, humorous) illustrations. Prof. Ritchie was certainly one of the most brilliant of Green's disciples; and his defence of the general idealistic position gained peculiar force from the special qualities of his mind. His interest in the particular sciences-especially biology-was genuine and keen; and this fact helped him to define his philosophical position, in relation to the sciences, with unusual clearness. The practical and, one might almost say, matter-of-fact tendency of his thought added a certain piquancy to his support of idealism. And few have shown greater keenness in discovering the weak points in an opponent's (and perhaps even in a friend's) case. In his more constructive work, however, one has a feeling that he often breaks off just when he comes in sight of an interesting problem. Of course this fact is, in the main, accounted for by the circumstance that so many of his writings are only fragments. The following may be given as a good illustration of the illu- minating remarks that one often finds in the course of Ritchie's discussions. It is from the Explorcatio Metaphysica, page 105. ' The Aristotelian formal cause is usually supposed, by scientific men who have read Mill's Logic, to be out of date. But the formal cause is exactly what we mean by a " law of nature". It is the universal or conceptual formula which is manifested in a number of particulars. And the very common habit of hypostatising " Energy," " Gravitation," " Evolution," etc., is only a recurrence to the mythological interpretation to which the Platonic doctrine of " ideas " or universal " forms " was exposed. The habit, again, of speaking of these abstractions with capital letters as efficient causes is the result of " animism "; it is so difficult to eliminate anthropomorphic interpretations even in scientific thinking.' The defence of the Aristotelian syllogism in the paper on ' Logic and Psychology' is another part of the work that seems to me to be remarkably well done. So also is the discussion of Equality in the fragment on ' Moral Philosophy' and the distinction between Illu- sion and Appearance in the paper on ' The One and the Many'. The general attack on Pragmatism in the latter paper is perhaps a little more of the nature of literary fireworks; but it is certainly bright and effective; and, in view of the pyrotechnical displays of some of our leading pluralists, it may at least claim the relative justification of ' answering a fool according to his folly'-if to be witty is folly. And it would be easy to point to many other pas- sages of conspicuous power, both literary and philosophical. On the other hand, it would not be easy to point to any actual</page><page sequence="5">DAVID G. RITCHIE, Philosophical Studies. 105 blunders or serious misstatements. In his general defence of idealism, I doubt whether he has sufficiently guarded against Sub- jective Idealism. The statement (p. 187) that objectivity means ' validity and coherence for other selves as well as for self ' can hardly be called clear. The reference to non-Euclidean geometry in the paper on ' Logic and Psychology' (pp. 150-151) seems to me to miss the point. The criticisms on Hedonism are seldom enlightening, and sometimes appear to be positively crude. It is surely, for instance, not a real criticism on any modern hedonistic theory to say (p. 299): ' If we use happiness in the sense in which it is used in ordinary language, the end is not happiness. Happi- ness is mainly dependent on the healthy state of the bodily secre- tions.' And probably one or two other passages might be noted in which the statements are somewhat unguarded or open to question. But, in general, it may be safely said that Ritchie's high reputation for careful and minute accuracy will be fully sustained by this posthumous volume. Indeed, where there is so much to praise and so little to cavil at, I am almost inclined to retract what was said before about the disappointing and tantalising character of the contents. At any rate, it might be fair to add that, if parts are disappointing, it is largely because other parts have raised our expectations so high. I may say, however, that what I find most tantalising in Ritchie's writing is the way in which fundamental difficulties are frequently set aside by means of statements that appear to be taken as axiomatic. Thus, on page 185, he says ' " Will," unless it be taken in a quite artificial sense, implies motives, which it is absurd to imagine as acting on "I the Absolute"'. Does will necessarily imply motives ' acting on' some one? May not the Absolute be thought as involving process and implying an end? The move- ment of thought seems here to be checked by a pure assumption. It was, in the main, instances of this kind that I had in view when I said that Ritchie seems often to stop short just when he comes upon the ultimate problem. But perhaps we ought not to complain of this. An essay on a philosophical subject must no doubt involve presuppositions; and at least Ritchie nearly always makes his presuppositions very clear. Moreover, he constantly shows readiness to reconsider them, and view them in new lights. Everywhere throughout the volume there is the charm of freshness, the charm of thought in the making. We seem to be listening to a sustained conversation-almost as in one of Plato's dialogues- passing rapidly from point to point, and illuminating everything by incisive utterance and humorous illustration. It is perhaps, after all, only the superabundance of good things that one finds tantalis- ing; as if flash upon flash of lightning kept out the sunlight. Yet it is all thoroughly coherent and scientific; and there is perhaps more to be learned from it, in reality, than from many volumes that seem more complete and systematic. But it is certainly diffi- cult to give a connected account of its contents in a review. The</page><page sequence="6">106 CRITICAL NOTICES: best that can be done in the end, and I can do it very heartily, is to recommend the reader to explore the book and tind out its many good things for himself. It should be added that the volume contains two excellent por- traits-one showing Ritchie as he appeared as an undergraduate at Oxford, the other as he appeared in his later years. J. S.
