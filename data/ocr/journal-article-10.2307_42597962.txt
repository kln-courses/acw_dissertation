Hamaya Hiroshi private archives The Lost Art of Resistance Linda Hoaglund My the in American Japan, unusual where decision parents I was to born were send and their liberal raised. children Protestant Because to Japanese they missionaries made public in Japan, where I was born and raised. Because they made the unusual decision to send their children to Japanese public schools, I learned about World War II from the perspective of a conquered nation. When I was ten years old - and the only American in my class - our teacher wrote the words "America" and "Atomic Bomb" in white chalk on the blackboard, and we opened our textbooks to a chapter titled "The Defeat." All forty Japanese children in my class turned around to stare at me. Though far too young to appreciate the meaning of "perpetrator" or "complicity," my adult life, which I have spent in New York after graduat- ing from Yale University, has been haunted by the acute discomfort I experienced in their incredulous gapes. I directed ANPO: Art X War in Japan in 2009 and 2010. The film depicts widespread and organized resistance to the American military presence in Japan that proliferated in the 1950s, and culminated in the i960 "ANPO struggle," a national democratic uprising against the extension of the United States-Japan Security Treaty. ( ANPO is the treaty's Japanese shorthand.) Despite nearly two months of massive daily protests, the treaty was ultimately ratified and, fifty years later, still permits the United States to station nearly one hundred bases in Japan. Although largely forgotten today, the i960 uprising was the defining event of postwar Japan. The oner- ous presence of a foreign military, fused with still-fresh traumatic memories of war, proved aš crucial a catalyst to Japanese artists as apartheid has been to South African writers. When I began subtitling films fifteen years ago, I immersed myself in Japanese cinematic depictions of the postwar era, curious to explore the context of my unusual, but sheltered, childhood. Watching ominously titled films such as The Bad Sleep Well ( Warui yatsu hodo oku nemuru ), Pigs and Battleships {Buta to gunkan), Night and Fog in Japan {Nihon no y oru to kiri ) and Elegant Beast (ßhitoyakana kedamono) - all produced in or shortly after i960 - it became clear to me that a different national trauma had unleashed this barrage of films by disparate filmmakers, seething with anguish, cynicism and rage. This revelation sent me to history books, where I read about the massive, tumultuous demonstrations that rocked Japan between May and June of i960, after CIA-backed Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke (1896-1987) ordered the police to eject opposition members of parliament IMPRESSIONS 33 31</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2.

Hamaya Hiroshi private archives in order to force a vote to extend the security treaty - a strategy that was tantamount to a coup d'état. Several years ago, an art-bookstore owner in Japan showed me a slim volume of photographs by Hamaya Hiroshi (1915-1999), titled Days of Rage and Grief {Ikari to kanashimi no kiroku), now long out of print. "This book is for you," he said, unaware of my curiosity about the i960 ANPO protests. The half-century-old images of ordinary Japanese citizens swamping the streets of Tokyo instantly captivated me (figs. 1-3). In Hamaya s book, high-contrast black-and-white images of students, "salarymen", "office ladies" and laborers, their faces brimming with defiance and hope, gradu- ally give way to scenes of chaos as the radical protesters' frustration and fury provoke them to charge the police, who strike back without mercy. Somehow, Hamaya captured the moment that the body of Kanba Michiko, an idealistic Tokyo University student asphyxiated by police in the melee, was carried away by fellow students. The next day, as news of her death spread, grief and shock crumpled the youthful mourners' faces. Several days later, Kishi formally ratified the treaty by means of an arcane parliamentary procedure, and the protests fizzled. In i960, Hamaya was a celebrated documentary photographer, the first Japanese member of Magnum Photo, the world s most prestigious photo agency, a cooperative founded by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and others in 1947; membership in it is by invitation-only. Although he had previously shunned political and social movements, Hamaya became 32 HOAGLUND: THE LOST ART OF RESISTANCE</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3. Hamaya Hiroshi. Days of Rage and Grief {Ikari to kanashimi no kiroku). i960. Black-and-white photo, vintage print. 20.3 X 25.4 cm. Hamaya Hiroshi private archives obsessed with the drama unfolding in Tokyo as ordinary citizens poured into the streets in the month following the May 19 forced vote. Before the parliamentary chaos, demonstrations were mostly organized and attended by Japans Socialist and Communist parties and the powerful student and labor unions. Once Kishis ham-fisted tactics were broadcast on television, housewives, children and office workers overwhelmed the streets of Tokyo, spontaneously banding behind the banner "Voices of the Voiceless" (Koe naki koe no kai) as protesters from all over Japan traveled to join them. Always positioning himself in the center of the action, barely taking time to sleep, Hamaya captured the subjective experience of a people terrified of being sucked back into war by Kishi, a member of Tõjõs cabinet, who drove Japan to war and was back in charge, this time ramming through Americas agenda. Looking at Hamayas i960 photographs today, they seem to anticipate the riveting images Charles Moore would take for Life magazine during the 1963 Birmingham protests, when African Americans confronted police dogs and fire hoses to claim their rights. In early 2007, during one of my frequent business trips back to Japan, I happened to be watching Sunday Morning Museum ( Nichiyõ bijutsukan ), the urbane weekly art program on NHK television, when an astounding image appeared on the screen. In the center of a large oil painting, peasants pointed their beseeching gazes and outsized hands at impervious police- men as storm clouds gathered on the horizon. It was unlike any Japanese art I had ever seen. Dropping everything, I set off for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, where the painter s first full retrospective, IMPRESSIONS 33 33</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4. Nakamura Hiroshi. Sunagawa No. 5 (Sunagawa gob an). 1955. Oil on plywood. 92.5 X 183 cm. Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo "Nakamura Hiroshi: Pictorial Disturbances 1953-2007" (Nakamura Hiroshi: Zuga jiken 1953-2007), was on view. The painting that propelled me to the museum, Sunagawa No. 5 (Sunagawa gobari), depicts the farmers who repeatedly clashed with the hundreds of riot police attempting to confiscate their ancestral lands to pave longer runways for the American military's Tachikawa Air Base (fig. 4). In Nakamura s depiction, the figures vault past their individual identities to become archetypal antagonists locked in the existential struggle between individual human rights and the power of the state. To ensure that I hadn't hallucinated the spellbinding show, I bought ten reproduction postcards of the Sunagawa painting, and a copy of the catalogue. Leafing through the volume in the ensuing months, I found Nakamuras images lodging in the same corner of my brain preoccupied with Hamayas photographs. Without fully realizing it, I had started musing about how to spin their art into a film. Not long after my discoveries, I met with Dr. John W. Dower, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Embracing Defeat (New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 1999), who asked me to contribute a unit to Visualizing Cultures, the website he created to host "image-driven scholarship" about Japan in the modern world and early-modern China. I showed him Hamayas photos and Nakamuras paintings and announced, "I want to do a unit on the art related to i960 ANPO, but I'm going to make the film first." Dr. Dower concurred and generously served as historical advisor to my film, escorting me through the tempestuous history of Japan in the 1950s. In 2008, 1 only knew about the two artists, but from the rich archive of strife-ridden postwar films, I had inklings there were more - I just had to find them. I had recently met a young Japanese graduate student writing 34 HOAGLUND: THE LOST ART OF RESISTANCE</page><page sequence="6">her thesis on the photography of the Provoke Movement from the 1960s. She offered to help me with art research. With Teshima Yuko's assistance, I began trolling the Internet for art related to ANPO, and within six months had acquired nearly one hundred Japanese art books. The only English-language publication we found was the one accompanying "Reconstructions: Avant-Garde Art in Japan 1945-1965," a 1985 exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. The book features thirty-five artists, including Nakamura, Ikeda Tatsuo, Ishii Shigeo and Yamashita Kikuji, the four whose work I had already decided to feature in my film, along with Okamoto Taro, Kikuhata Mokuma, Kawara On and many others for whom I could not find room. It was only after I finished the film in spring of 2010 that I learned about the catalogue for "Realism in Postwar Japan 1945-1960" (Sengo Nihon no riarizumu 1945-1960), an exhibition convened at the Nagoya City Museum in 1998. It was as comprehensive an assembly then possible of the realist art produced in the wake of that catastrophic war, chronologically presented from Japans defeat. Thumbing through more than four hundred images, I reflected on my good fortune to have been initially lured down the rabbit hole of this postwar art by Nakamura and Hamaya. If I had known of the vast archive awaiting me, I might not have summoned the courage to tackle a project of this scope and scale. As it turned out, the biggest challenge making ANPO: Art X War was piecing the prodigious trove into ninety coherent minutes. Once I began filming, I sought out Nakamura first. He told me he had frequently joined the 1955 Sunagawa protests, serving in his own mind as a "reporter at the front," brandishing not a camera but sketchbook and pencil. Nevertheless, he had been intimidated by the raw energy of the often-violent confrontations that Kamei Fumio had filmed for his 3:955 documentary, The Bloody Record of Sunagawa (. Ryüketsu no kiroku: Sunagawa ). After watching it, he had wondered, " How on earth am I going to match that realism in a painting?" He decided to compete with the impact of Kamei s footage by inventing his own pictorial strategy, a "close-up" in his chosen two-dimensional art form. Inspired by the montage technique of Eisensteins Battleship Potemkin , he deliberately radicalized the law of perspective, painting not one, but four receding points, in order to train the viewer s eye on the drama unfolding in its center (see fig. 4). The elfin monk directly below the peasants' "close-up" in that painting represents one point of his adroit artistic solution, a tribute to the stoic Nichiren-sect monks who rallied to the peasants' cause to sustain the brunt of the police beatings. Nakamura also recalled how the originality and simplicity of Diego Riveras murals inspired him to conjure a socialist realism rooted in Japanese ethno-geography, distinct from European and Soviet realism. Today, his iconic painting is in the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, while Kameis overtly propagandistic film languishes in obscurity, as a cinematic footnote. Nakamura s "Pictorial Disturbances" comprised some one hundred oil paintings and scores of magazine and book covers and posters. Two other IMPRESSIONS 3 3 35</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5. Nakamura Hiroshi. Gunned Down ( Shasatsu ). 1957. Oil on canvas. 73 x 91 cm. Koriyama City Museum of Art, Fukushima iconic works in the exhibit were Gunned Down ( Shasatsu ) and The Base (Kichi) (figs. 5, 6). He had painted both in 1957, after an American soldier guarding a shooting range on the Somagahara U.S. Army Base, at the foot of Mount Fuji, deliberately shot and killed a local farmers wife. She had trespassed on the range to scavenge spent brass shell casings, useless to the American military, but which the woman could sell as scrap metal to buy food for her six hungry children. Although Nakamura had not witnessed the shooting, he worked from widely publicized media photographs, which had ignited his imagination and incensed the Japanese public to the point of threatening the security treaty, originally signed in 1951. After intense United States-Japan negotiations, the soldier was tried in a Japanese court, but served no time for his crime. Nakamura recalls how "conventional painting composition just wasn't sufficient to deliver the message and the impact I wanted. So I used the camera eye/ meaning both still photo- graphs and movies, to express my outrage." 1 Nakamuras deliberate rejection of both objectivity and conventional aesthetics was at the core of the Japanese "Reportage" movement, which inspired not only him, but thousands of "amateur" painters, recently liber- ated from the tyrannical drudgery of a war that had laid siege to their daily lives and blighted their imaginations. In Nakamuras words, "Anyone who wanted to paint, including professionals, organized local Reportage groups. We called it Reportage for a reason. You would visit sites to create a documentary record of how you felt witnessing specific events." He went on to wryly recollect, "You may laugh at me, but my intention was that a single painting could change the world, could actually change the people who saw it."2 36 HOAGLUND: THE LOST ART OF RESISTANCE</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 6. Nakamura Hiroshi in front of his painting, The Base (1957), in the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. May 11, 2009. Photo: Yamazaki Yutaka Reportage art, portraying resistance to the presence of American military bases, fallout from Pacific Ocean hydrogen-bomb testing and the grim working conditions and grinding poverty characteristic of Japan in the 1950s, never found a place in the commercial art world. Instead, it was exhibited to the general public in the intentionally jury- free annual "Independent Exhibit" (Andepandan ten), or the "Nippon Exhibit" (Nippon ten), sponsored by the Zenei Bijutsukai (Avant-Garde Art Association). Most of their creations are lost today, but several tenacious painters persisted, creating transcendent art, safely ensconced in museum storage, or languishing in boxes, still far from the public eye. To film an interview with Nakamura in front of The Base , painted on a sheet of plywood cracking with age, I had to arrange for it to be transported from storage at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, and temporarily hung on a wall in the museum (see fig. 6). Yamashita Kikuji (1919-1986), another major Reportage artist, had studied under Fukuzawa Ichiro (1898-1992), who in turn was deeply influenced by European surrealists Max Ernst, Giorgio De Chirico and Salvador Dali. In 1939, Yamashita was already a promising artist when he was drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army and sent to fight in China. There, he witnessed and sketched scenes from the front, including dozens of pencil drawings of "com- fort women." Several of those sketches are reproduced in Yamashita Kikuji (1996), the publication accompanying his retrospective that toured regional Japanese museums ten years after his death. Plagued by a physical ailment, Yamashita had spent many days in the infirmary, adjacent to the women's quarters. Preserved in his native prefecture s Tokushima Art Museum, these rare drawings are devastating precisely because they are imbued not with the "realism" of a photographic camera, but with the artists obvious IMPRESSIONS 3 3 37</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 7.

Nihon Gallery private collection, Tokyo empathy for the unspeakable conditions his subjects, as he, had no choice but to endure. The museum gift shop sells reproductions of the sketches as gift cards, but I was told sales have never been brisk. Although Yamashita remains obscure, he has acquired a measure of distinction for his macabre work, The Story of Akebono Village ( Akebonomura monogatari , 1953). It is an apparition in red and black, in which a gigantic boar and anthropomorphic foxes flank a grandmother who has hanged herself to evade thugs unleashed by the landlord to evict her from a squalid farmhouse. In the foreground, a man lies in a blood-soaked pond. Yamashita had traveled to the remote village at the behest of the Cultural Brigade of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), which had instructed him to make a kamishibai (a story related in a dozen or so storyboards and recited narration) depicting the besieged villagers' plight. Yamashita never delivered the kamishibai , conjuring instead a painting hailed as a modern surrealist masterpiece when it showed in the "Avant-garde Artists of Japan 1910-1970" Paris exhibition at the Pompidou Center in 1986. Tragically, the artist passed away a few weeks shy of his first international exhibition and acclaim. A quarter of a century later, he has yet to achieve the prominence he deserves in his native country; decades after he parted ways with the JCP, he never wavered from his commitment to taboo themes. I had been steered to Yamashitas surreal and uncompromising aesthetic by Sawaragi Noi, an independent curator I consulted when researching ANPO: Art X War . After perusing Yamashitas sumptuous catalogue raisonné, posthumously produced by Nihon Gallery in Tokyo, which has represented him since 1963, 1 decided to open my film with The Tale of New Japan ( Shin Nihon monogatari), which he created on the heels oí Akebono Village (fig. 7). 38 HOAGLUND: THE LOST ART OF RESISTANCE</page><page sequence="10">(These were the two works the independent curator Hariu Ichiro selected to represent Yamashitas work at the Pompidou in 1986 under the rubric Realism and Political Movements , and Hariu also chose Nakamuras Sunagawa No. 5.) I found The Tale of New Japan carefully stored in a custom-made box in Yamashitas gallery, which retains much of his most important work. The gallery owner explained, "They re in my safekeeping, until I find an institu- tion that will permanently exhibit them, not hide them in storage." On the large canvas, a cross-eyed pug, her lips glistening scarlet, is strung up by a monster of indeterminate origin that clutches her bangs and tail in its iron grip, its tongue drooping lasciviously over his high-heeled detainee. Behind them, English-language signs point to "Hotel Candle," "Mobile Home" and "Pacific Heights." To amplify his metaphor, Yamashita stamped the captive canine "Yellow Stool." It is difficult to appreciate the genesis of his ferocious vision without knowing how profoundly Yamashita was haunted by his childhood and his experience of war. To find out, I interviewed his widow, Atsuko, past eighty, still obviously besotted with the man who had married her: "I was a bird- lover and an orphan," she told me. "Those were his conditions for a bride. I had pet birds, too, so I loved birds." After they married, the Yamashitas were notorious among their clique of bohemian artists for the flock of barred owls that shared their home, visible today in black-and-white photographs and documentary footage, peering down from the rafters or balanced on Yamashitas shoulder, watching him paint. Mrs. Yamashita told me how her husband had been raised in a remote village in northern Tokushima, which bordered a community of outcasts, burakumin . "Even as a child, he knew that they were being mistreated and discriminated against. His mother was quite unusual, and she would exchange friendly greetings with the burakumin , visiting them from time to time." Given his conscious distaste for bigotry, he found the totalitarian nature of Japans imperial army excruciating. When I asked her if he had talked about his three years in China, Atsuko told me, "He didn't talk about it much, but he would cry out from his nightmares at night. He sounded like he was in such pain that I used to wake him. He didnt tell me directly, but in 1970, he published an article, A Peephole onto Discrimination/ In it, he wrote about how he had executed a prisoner of war in a very brutal fash- ion. It made me heartsick." I had discovered his original text in a modest 1979 publication about the painter titled Sinking Swamp {Kuzureru numa), excerpted as follows, and recited by an actor in my film: "I can never forget the day that we buried alive and tortured to death a Chinese prisoner. I had become an animal masquerading as a human being, capable of committing savage acts, but unable to see my own savagery." Atsuko concluded my interview saying, "He deeply regretted the fact that he couldn't give his own life by refusing that order. He wanted to take responsibility for what he had done. That became the driving force behind his paintings." Yamashitas catalogue raisonné makes clear that wartime memories had infected his artistic vision long before his public confession. In Deification IMPRESSIONS 3 3 39</page><page sequence="11">of a Soldier { Matsurawareru s ens hi), the eye sockets of a skull perched over a two-headed horse seemingly peer up at its helmet, but their gaze cannot look out, only inward, as if imprisoned by memories (fig. 8). After the i960 protests, which both Nakamura and Yamashita vigorously supported, both painters turned away from artistically "reporting" actual events. In 1962, Yamashita titled one painting Alienation {Fumo no soto). His work became increasingly eerie and abstract, evolving toward a singular surrealism: a kind of Reportage, but now epistles from the desolate terrain of the perpetrators cursed heart. I had asked Nakamura about his memories of the war, which ended when he was twelve, when I had first interviewed him in 2008 to prepare a trailer for my film. "I remember the fire bombings extremely well," he told me. He recalled watching the bombs incinerate his native Hamamatsu overnight, "leaving the whole city burned to the ground. There was nothing left. You know those photographs of the ruins of Hiroshima, it actually looked a lot like that. I really cant believe I'm still alive today. Those bombs are really bad for your heart." In i960, Nakamura painted Leaping Samurai {Samurai no hikõ ), foregrounding a beheaded medieval warrior, plunging behind his horse, also topsy-turvy, while a citadel of power looms unscathed behind the doomed pair. The millions of his fellow protesters who quickly abandoned their resistance once the treaty passed had disgusted Nakamura. For the next several years, all his paintings were suffused with fantastical crimson clouds and landscapes. Having abandoned depicting unfolding events, he, too, stumbled on a type of Reportage - communiqués from the terrorized firebombing survivors post- traumatic heart. When I asked him why his paintings suddenly turned red in 1961, Nakamura confided, "I doubt I would have made paintings with bright red clouds if I hadn't lived through the firebombing. I think I was traumatized by the war and the fear." When I was initially introduced to Nakamura by the curator who had helped organize "Pictorial Disturbances," before I could even sit down, the effusive painter burst out, "There was a civil war raging back then." I asked him to hold his thoughts until we had the camera set up, when he continued, "Things aren't so orderly that after a war you automatically have peace. Its not that clean. You cant skip what comes between war and peace. They say there never was a civil war in Japan, but I actually believe there was one, right after the war." He went on to elaborate, "There was also the dilemma that Japan had been the perpetrator, but is now acting like it was the victim. The contradiction of not knowing whether you're a victim or a perpetrator - I think that was part of our civil war. As an artist, I had a right and a responsibility to represent that."3 "Put a lid on what stinks" {Kusai mono ni futa) was arguably Japans favorite aphorism of the Shõwa period that ended in 1989. Indeed, Japan is often criticized for its inability to face its war-era atrocities, and the turbulent postwar "civil war" has mostly been expunged from public memory, along with the i960 uprising. Yet, Yamashita, Nakamura and Hamaya, along with scores of fellow artists, deliberately sought out the whiff of resistance and the stench of smothered history, transfiguring them into daunting, 40 HOAGLUND: THE LOST ART OF RESISTANCE</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 8.

Although most museums and the commercial world of art shunned their work, several resolute artists refused to quit. Condemn- ing themselves to the margins of the art world, they bided their time and kept on painting. A few were fortunate enough to be rediscovered and championed by a new generation of curators ignorant of the strife their parents had survived. Although many of these works of art are now in museum collections, they are seldom exhibited. If I had not stumbled upon Nakamuras Sunagawa No. 5 on NHK that Sunday morning, or gotten a tip from a sympathetic book dealer, I, too, might have remained oblivious to this vast, precious reservoir of art, a stunning alternative to the history of Japan we think we already know. © Notes i.
