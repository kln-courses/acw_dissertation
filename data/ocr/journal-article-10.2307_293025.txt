Pp. xv + 539. $10.00. The appearance of the first volume of a new comprehensive History of Greek Philosophy, to be published by the Cambridge University Press, is an event of some moment. The present volume is one of five to be written by Guthrie, extending from Thales through the Hellenistic period, but stopping short of the Neoplatonists; and "the Press has plans," we are told, "for a continuation by other hands." We may thus anticipate a truly monumental work. The first volume treats of the Milesians, Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, Alcmaeon, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus. The pre- liminaries are brief: a preface, a two-page " Note on the Sources," a list of abbreviations, an " Introduction and Summary " (pp. 1-25), and a short chapter (pp. 26-38) on " The Beginnings of Philosophy in Greece." The volume concludes with a generous bibliography (pp. 493-503), an index of passages quoted or referred to (pp. 505- 13), and a general index (pp. 514-39). What are the aims of such a history, and what are the criteria by which it must be judged? Guthrie himself explains his goals: to present an account intelligible to a reader who knows no Greek, and yet to quote some of the ancient texts for the benefit of classical scholars; to " do justice to the opposing views of reputable scholars, mediate between them, and give the most reasonable conclusions ..." (p. ix); to place Greek philosophy in the broad context of Greek life and thought, yet include in the separate sections of the history sufficient material to orientate students with special interests and "form a starting-point for their own researches" (p. xi). He quite deliberately excludes "originality" from the list. Guthrie is well aware that in the execution of so great an under- taking he may expect, at the very least, to displease some of his readers some of the time. Indeed one may anticipate objections to the very statement of aims. The proposal to "mediate" between opposing views of reputable scholars brings to mind that well- intentioned Roman proconsul who offered to help the philosophers at Athens settle their differences. "Reasonable" conclusions are what we settle for when we have given up the search for really convincing resolutions of conflicts of evidence. And even if original contributions cannot be required of the historian, at least they should not be ruled out a principio. Perhaps the most conspicuous feature of Guthrie's cautious ap- proach is his alignment with tradition. This is inevitable; if he had subscribed to some of the more radical attempts to discredit our sources of information about the early philosophers, he would not have undertaken to write their history. As it is, he is free to acknowledge the attacks yet to maintain that the traditional accounts are at least reasonable. An example is his conclusion (p. 166) that it is "rash to deny outright" that Pythagoras himself was responsible for a causal linkage between transmigration and the life spent in the pursuit of wisdom. Or again, Thales' reasons for the choice of water as arche were probably " similar to those inferred by Aristotle " (p. 65). 435</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. And Guthrie accepts the disputed evidence of the Metaphysics for the date of Alcmaeon, for "all in all, it is more reasonable to believe that Alcmaeon, as we are told, was already alive in the old age of Pythagoras, and was a thinker of considerable power and influence, than to push his lifetime down into the manhood of Plato in order to show (on little evidence) that he was not original at all" (p. 359). At times he uses arguments from reputation: " How- ever, unless we are going to deny any original ideas to Pythagoras himself (in which case it is a little difficult to account for his repu- tation), his teaching must have been on these lines " (p. 448, n. 2); and " This together with the brilliant nature of the discovery itself may well justify the confidence that it was due to the genius of the founder" (p. 222). One may imagine that Guthrie would give a similar answer if challenged on his characterization of Anaximander as a "friend" (p. 72) of Thales. The evidence is from the doxographers who, as Guthrie states (p. 43), used of the Milesians the terms that came to be descriptive of the relations between members of a school. The word gnorimos was one of these terms; it tells us no more than that the doxographers considered the Milesians a school. An appeal to probabilities is, no doubt, an effective answer to the "hardened sceptic " (p. 207); yet all too often the probabilities themselves rest on sweeping generalizations and unsupported assump- tions. Thales attached life and divinity to his cause of motion and change because he was a Greek, and had a "Greek mind" (p. 67). "It was in fact a universal Greek idea to think of the primary and essential character of psyche as being its motive power" (p. 65). The eternal motion of Anaximander's arche may be explained by the fact that " since for the Greek the very notion of life involves self-caused motion, no external cause was conceivable, let alone demanded" (p. 91). The Milesians and Heraclitus relied on the common Greek conception of the circularity of time (p. 452). The Pythagoreans " were even less isolated than other philosophers from the current beliefs of their time " (p. 198). How did Guthrie obtain this insight into Greek belief and the "Greek mind" of the sixth century? "Ask any Greek," he bids us (p. 67); how we wish we could! But granting that there was an early Greek mind, and that we can explore it, how closely should we identify the philosophers with it? Alemaeon, we are told (p. 356), "probably" supposed that the soul at death is released to join the pure soul-substance among the stars, as this notion was popular in the fifth century. Even more surprising is the assignment to Heraclitus, of all people, of a view about the soul after death, on the ground that "it would be in keeping with all the habits of early Greek thought " (p. 481). As Guthrie himself exclaims in another context (p. 451), "How Heraclitus would have wept to find himself included with the polloi after all that he had done to cut himself off! " Admittedly a historian of philosophy brings to his work a con- ceptual framework which imposes a degree of order on his material. Here too Guthrie follows a rather conventional pattern, in spite of the difficulties it creates. Explaining why the history of philosophy begins with Thales, he observes that Greek philosophy was born when religious faith was replaced by a faith that " the visible world 436</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. conceals a rational and intelligible order, that the causes of the natural world are to be sought within its boundaries, and that auto- nomous human reason is our sole and sufficient instrument for the search" (p. 29). This intellectual revolution occurred in an environ- ment that " provided both the leisure and the stimulus for disinter- ested intellectual inquiry" (p. 30), for "philosophy (including pure science) can only be hampered by utilitarian motives" (p. 31). Yet if these are the hallmarks of the philosopher, Thales' claim to that title is by no means clear, as he did not, by Guthrie's account, abandon the gods (p. 65), but only the anthropomorphic deities of popular religion (p. 68); and Guthrie concedes that Farrington was probably right in portraying the Milesians as " active practical men" (p. 52). The ideal of the disinterested secular philosopher must be abandoned when we come to Pythagoras and his school, who retained in their religion certain primitive features (pp. 182 ff.), regarded Apollo as their particular patron (p. 203), and made philosophy subservient to practical ends. The situation is not clari- fied by Guthrie's stating on the one hand that the Pythagoreans did not reject the contemporary polytheism (p. 203) and on the other that Empedocles, under Pythagorean influence, "gave the name Apollo to his highest god, to whom he explicitly denies all anthropo- morphic features" (p. 203, n. 3). Guthrie's philosophical ideal is further tarnished when he says that Thales rationalized Mesopotamian and Egyptian myths (p. 81), and that the belief in earth as the Great Mother was "rationalized and clothed in scientific terms by the philosophers" (p. 291). It is pretty well dismantled by the words " Since the keynote of any philosophical system is struck when we understand its aim . .." (p. 182), a statement which Guthrie qualifies, rather apologetically, by explaining that " clear thinking itself may be a philosopher's aim as much as anything else." The final blow falls when he concurs with William James: "William James described the history of philosophy as to a great extent that of a clash of human tempera- ments. Temperament being no conventionally recognized reason, the philosopher urges impersonal reasons only for his conclusions. Yet his temperament gives him a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objective premisses" (p. 117). Guthrie's conceptual framework (or should I say "tempera- ment "?) gives a prominent place to matter and form. Describing, for instance, the change in spirit that philosophy underwent in its passage from Ionia to Italy, he says, " Study of matter gave way to study of form " (p. 4). He must presently explain, however, that the Milesians did not yet have a conception of matter (pp. 64f.), that they were mathematically minded (pp. 218 f.), and that their elements provided not merely the matter of the universe but also its source of motion and, presumably, its principle of order. And while the Pythagoreans "achieved with remarkable suddenness a rational conception of the significance of form" (p. 467), they "were not quite aware of what they had done. The distinction between form and matter had as yet received no clear formulation. Consequently, though they were in fact describing only the struc- tural scheme of things . . . they believed that they were describing their material nature too . . ." (p. 238). Xenophanes posited "a 437</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. unity in a stricter sense than did the Milesians" but " had not yet grasped the distinction between material and logical unity and for this reason did not make his concept altogether clear" (p. 380). Heraclitus, finally, " had the intelligence to perceive and the courage to assert" that "the logical outcome of materialism is the doctrine of uninterrupted flux "; "for the matter of things is in fact always changing, and the only permanent thing is form, which can be expressed in the timeless language of mathematical equations" (p. 467). (The last part of this quotation is uttered ex cathedra and is not intended as an interpretation of Heraclitus.) And yet Heraclitus' fire is even less "material" than the elements of the Milesians: ". .. the divine force which brings rational order into the universe is at the same time a physical, material entity . . ." (p. 429). In all these assessments Guthrie is victim of his own scheme. Taking matter and form as basic philosophical concepts, he is obliged to show that even the earliest philosophers were occupied with them; but finding that they did not distinguish matter from form, he must take this omission as an indication of the primitive quality of their thought. He views in much the same way the failure of Anaximenes (p. 128) and others to differentiate between inert matter and a source of motion. His approach is not unlike that of Aristotle; the history of philosophy, in its incipient stages at least, is interpreted teleologically as groping toward a specific terminal view, assumed to be normative. For Guthrie, it is Plato " who finally pulls the threads together . . ." (p. 210). Such an approach is misleading to the extent that it suggests that the Presocratic philosophers were moving unawares in a single direction and toward a single goal. A major difficulty in any treatment of the Presocratics arises from their use of familiar words to express new ideas. Sometimes the very form of expression indicates that their words are not to be taken in the ordinary sense, as when Heraclitus says, " God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, satiety and hunger." We must suppose that Heraclitus is here attempting to express an idea for which he has no adequate vocabulary. Similarly, Guthrie considers the seeming self-contradiction of the Pythagoreans, when they say that things imitate numbers, and that things are numbers, to arise from the difficulty of stating precisely in ordinary language the relation of things to numbers (p. 230). And even without the help of paradox we may recognize, for instance, that Anaximenes' air is not the aer of his contemporaries (p. 126) and that Hera- clitus' fire is not a visible flame (p. 432). But often the line between literal and transferred meaning is hard to draw. When we read that the heavenly bodies are " nourished " by exhalations from water, are we to suppose merely that there is in the physical world a process of replenishment analogous to the taking of food, or is Guthrie correct in saying that behind such a statement is the view that the whole universe is a living organism (p. 67)? Or again, is not the very term " living organism" given a new meaning when applied to the universe as a whole? In general, Guthrie tends to minimize, where possible, the metaphorical element in such terms. Anaximander really thought of the universe as living. Pythagoras' universe literally breathes (cf. p. 200). Guthrie also takes religious 438</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS. terms in their literal meaning. By calling the apeiron divine, Anaxi- mander did not mean that it possesses certain properties ordinarily associated with divinity, but that it is itself a divine being (cf. p. 114). Heraclitus' statement, `os advOpWTr? Saltov is not a redefini- tion of man's Sa/zwv as nothing more than his os,, but it means literally that "a man's character is the immortal and potentially divine part of him" (p. 482). This tendency to take the words of the Presocratics in their ordinary meanings permits Guthrie to bring the philosophers into close relationship with their times. As they were speaking the language, so they were by and large thinking the thoughts, of the ordinary Greek. In this he seems to outrun the evidence. It is evident that Guthrie has made a conscientious effort to present divergent views on disputed points. The recent British scholarship that provides the immediate context of his study receives prominent, but by no means exclusive, attention. In his review of the opinions of others he must be at once pleader and judge, and he is clearly more comfortable in the former role. His detailed coverage of the material insures the lasting value of the volume as a work of reference. It is beautifully printed. PHILLIP DE LACY. NORTIWESTERN UNIVERSITY. JOCHEN BLEICKEN. Senatsgericht und Kaisergericht: Eine Studie zur Entwicklung des Prozessrechtes im friihen Prinzipat. G6t- tingen, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1962. Pp. 198. (Abhand- lungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Gottingen, Phil- ologisch-historische Klasse, Dritte Folge, Nr. 53.) This tortuously written monograph, a Habilitationsschrift at GSt- tingen, is a good and useful study. At the close of the Introduction Bleicken announces (p. 16): " Hinter allem steht die tberzeugung, dass die neuen Begriffe und Institutionen des Kaiserreiches nicht durch einen einzigen schipferischen Akt ins Leben traten, sondern allein durch die faktische Existenz der zwar republikanisch formu- lierten, doch der Republik im Grunde wesensfremden Gewalt des Princeps in einem fast unmerklichen Prozess gleichsam neben und zwischen der herk6mmlichen Ordnung sich bildeten, um am Ende sich an die Stelle des Alten zu setzen." That appeals to this reviewer as surely correct. There are five chapters: Die Entstehung des Senats- gerichtes; Das Senatsgericht unter Augustus und Tiberius; Die kaiserliche Strafjurisdiktion vor der Entstehung des allgemeinen Kaisergerichtes; Die Entstehung des allgemeinen Kaisergerichtes; Die Ausbildung der reformatorischen Appellation; two appendices, the first a list of Senatorial proceedings de repetundis from A. D. 13 to 107, twenty-seven cases, the second discussing Der friihkaiserzeit- liche Strafprozess ausserhalb Roms on the basis very largely of the evidence afforded by the Cyrene edicts; an inadequate two-page index, and eight-page list of passages cited.
