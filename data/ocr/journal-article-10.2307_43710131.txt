<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINS OF HEBREW RELIGION: A STUDY IN METHOD The biblical record presents patriarchal religion as the embryo whence came the full-bodied faith of Israel in Yahweh. The identification of the God of the Fathers with Yahweh is explicit in P (Ex 6,2), emphatic in E (3,15f). In the J tradition the identification is equally real, but implicit rather than explicit, having no formal statement of the identity; he who appears to Abraham is simply called Yahweh (cf. Gn 12,1.7; 13,14 etc.). The thesis of Genesis in its present form is clear: it presents patriarchal religion as an organic part of the religion of Israel, the first stage of Yahweh's revelation to his chosen people. Patriarchal religion is incor- porated into the integrated theological pattern of Genesis-Kings. This pattern is viewed as being rooted in history, and patriarchal religion is presented in Genesis as the historical record of Yahweh's earliest dealings with the ancestors of Israel. The dilemma confronts us : is this identifica- tion factual, or is it due to later theological rewriting of the earlier docu- ments ? The reliability of the biblical record has received striking confirmation from archeology in regard to the general historical setting and also in matters of specific detail.1 Let it be at once admitted that we do not con- sider the religious data of Genesis confirmed as historical by virtue of the fact that Genesis gives a reliable picture of nomadic life in Canaan in the second millennium. The new factor in the case is theological speculation, and the editors who are scrupulous in reproducing geographical data and legal custom exactly may be equally scrupulous in obliterating all traces of earlier polytheism. The possibility is there. But the possibility is likewise there that the record that is faithful in essential historicity is also faithful in essential theology. With these possibilities before us as equally admis- sible we approach the investigation which is to determine the acceptance or rejection of the statement of the biblical record on patriarchal religion. Stated in a general way the method of the investigation is comparative. The objective of this comparative study is to determine the basic identity or diversity of patriarchal religion and contemporary polytheisms. When the scholar moves further to determine the origins and causes of the diver- sity, if such is shown to exist, in so far as his conclusions overreach the observed data, he is dealing in hypothesis. Such hypothesis, as opposed to 1 Cf. R. de Vaux, "Les patriarches hébreux et les découvertes modernes," RB 53 (1946), 321-48; 55 (1948), 321-47; 56 (1949), 5-36; H. H.

In this event the merits of his case rest upon the value of his philosophy. The comparative method has followed two general lines. The first took its orientation from the observed data of ethnology, the second from the documentary evidence of archeological research. First, some ob- servations on the ethnological method. A book that exerted great influence on research in the religion of the OT was William Robertson Smith's Lectures on the Religion of the Semites.2 That this was a book of unusual merit is seen from the fact that, first published in 1889, it appeared in a third revised and enlarged edition in 1927 supplemented with introduction and notes by Stanley A. Cook of Cambridge. Père Lagrange, whose equally distinguished work on Semitic religions appeared four years after Robertson Smith's first edition, gave it highest praise for the abundance of detail and penetrating insights, observing at the same time that it unfortunately paid too little attention to the Babylonian materials and gave too much emphasis to totemism in the history of religions.3 Robertson Smith worked under evolutionary theory. This was largely dependent on the philosophical temper of the age in England, a temper which was powerfully influenced by the work of John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, through whom the positivism of Comte passed into the history of religions and related fields. It is quite impossible to understand the develop- ment of Robertson Smith's thought without an understanding of the nature of English positivistic philosophy.4 Two errors are to be ascribed to the older ethnological method: the false notion of unilinear evolution and induction on the basis of partial evidence.5 There can be no question that earlier notions of evolution are today dis- credited by recognized authorities. Father Wilhelm Schmidt writes: "In the» whole domain of Ethnology the older evolutionary school is bankrupt. The lovely long single lines of development which it used to construct so readily have been shattered and overthrown by the criticism of the new historical method."6 Professor Albright states : There can no longer be any doubt that Fr. Schmidt has successfully disproved 2 W. R. Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites , (3rd ed. with an introduc- tion and notes by S. A. Cook; London, 1927). 3 M. J.

Nor can Maretťs correction to pre-animism (dynamism) - animism - polytheism - monotheism escape radical modification.7 Professor Cook writes: "It is true that it would now be agreed that the course of religious development did not run so simply as he (Robertson Smith) thought; but all theories of the evolution of culture are under con- sideration."8 It hardly needs observing here that all evolutionary method as such is not discredited by these or any other authorities. What is dis- credited is the unilinear progressive evolution of higher religions from inferior forms. Progress, or evolution, is everywhere observable in the domain of religion. Since religion is a social and psychological phenomenon rather than physical it manifests a discontinuity and requires more careful analysis along lines of patterns or systems according to the newer meth- odology. The second error in method was the extension of conclusions beyond the limits of evidence. This insufficiency of evidence was twofold : the ex- clusive, or almost exclusive, attention given to religious phenomena among non-civilized or savage groups, and the insufficiency of observed data within that group from the aspect of geographical distribution.9 The OT exegete is so dependent upon ancillary sciences, such as anthropology, that he must endeavor to evaluate hypotheses deriving from them, and where that is not possible to make conclusions based upon them only tentative. It is worth noting that the older evolutionary idea has held on longest in England. It is surprising to read under the date of 1930 the pages of Oesterley-Robinson's Hebrew Religion 10 where patriarchal religion is discussed. The method is that of the older evolutionary school as appears from the following excerpt: "These then are the three stages of belief (animatism - animism - polytheism) through which all races pass before they reach a higher form of religion ; and the Hebrew race was no excep- tion as the evidence from the Old Testament shows."11 We immediately add the recent statement of Professor Wright : it can be confidently said that when Oesterley and Robinson in Hebrew Religion . . . take more than one fourth of their book to describe the animistic and magical background of Israel's religion, they are dealing neither with pagan nor 7 From the Stone Age to Christianity (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1940), 125. 8 W.

It cannot be objected that Patriarchal nomadism would naturally be more "primitive" than the inhabitants of contemporary Palestine. While this may have been true relatively, a study of the evidence for Amorite religion, particularly in the Amorite onomasticon, and indications of such sources as the Egyptian Tale of Sinuhe, lead us a long, long way from the picture which Oesterley and Robinson have painted.12 We contrast these statements to illustrate that it is a matter of primary methodological importance to determine the degree of relevance of the anthropological materials before they are applied to OT interpretation. Before embarking on exegesis with a plethora of data from ethnology we must first pose the question: in what cultural stage did the Hebrews of Genesis find themselves? Were they non-civilized peoples of savage mentality? This question has been answered as the pattern of Near East culture of the early second millennium emerges ever more clearly. The trend in recent scholarship is to view the methodological value of ethnology of secondary importance in the question at hand. Thus S. H. Hooke writes : Archeology may be said to be responsible for a new orientation in the study of the origins of the Hebrew religion. It is no case of a revival of pan-Baby- Ionian fantasies, but the recognition that the Hebrew religion in its early stages cannot have been uninfluenced by the general religious situation which charac- terized its environment . . . there is a growing tendency to recognize that the main outlines of Hebrew pre-prophetic religion may receive more illumination from the direction of the general pattern of Mesopotamian religion in the second millennium B.C. than from animistic remains, or from a somewhat hypothetical nomad culture.18 In speaking of Mesopotamian religions, Professor Dhorme, so long con- versant with them, expresses the judgment that these ancient religions from their first appearance in history have already achieved a remarkable degree of development that sets them apart from so-called primitive religions such as fetishism, animism, and totemism; rather do they keep pace with the 12 "Biblical Archeology Today," BA 10 (1947), 19f. Note that this part of the book (Part I: The Background) is due to Dr. Oesterley; cf. xxiv. Albright observes, "One cannot deny that there were early survivals from still earlier stages of religious culture; the great mistake is to construct a system out of such survivals, arbitrarily disregarding or rejecting all contrary evidence for a higher level of ethical and spiritual life and thought, which is explained away or treated as later interpolation in earlier sources."

O'Hara artistic and literary culture of ancient Western Asia, as with economic and political progress.14 Elsewhere the same author states that the most authoritative exegetes and historians have reacted against this parti pris that reduces the religious ideas of the Semites to the most backward stages.15 We do not feel it necessary to heap up witnesses. To the informed reader such a shift in attitude will be seen as inevitable. This is not to say that the ethnological method is to be disregarded com- pletely. It has an important role to play in the study of Near East religions as Albright has shown.16 It has value for the subject of our discussion, not with the sweep once given it, but of a secondary character and subject to documentary control. According to Oesterley's reconstruction animism was in full vogue among the forbears of the Hebrews, and formed the back- ground of their religion. He sees remnants of totemism in animal names like Rachel (ewe), Leah (wild cow), etc. This view is not restricted to Oesterley. H. Wheeler Robinson draws a picture of patriarchal religion that closely resembles it ; for him too the Patriarchs move in "the general atmosphere of animism."17 In our judgment these men have missed the mark ; Professor Hooke is nearer reality when he writes : It is possible that such animism or animatism underlies the beginnings of culture in the Nile Valley, in Mesopotamia, and in Canaan; but such antecedents lie so far back in the mist of remote time that it is difficult to assign any definite place to them in the shaping of the general religious background of the Hebrews ... it is almost impossible to determine whether any particular feature con- sidered in isolation . . . represents a genuine survival of primitive animistic beliefs, or a simplification and degradation of elements belonging to a more developed stage of religion.18 Other scholars, although strongly influenced by the concepts of animism and dynamism, see the early religion of the Hebrews as verging towards the personalist. Thus Professor Lods describes it as a stage "between polydaemonism and polytheism."19 Professor Meek describes the religion of Israel's ancestors as 14 Cf. E.

The world was full of spirits controlling and directing human affairs. Some were inherent in natural phenomena; others were spirits of the departed. Some of the outstand- ing of both classes rose eventually to the ranks of gods and were given personal names.20 He considers survivals as a more important source for the religion of the early Hebrews than archeological remains, and asserts that "it is in them that we must find the origin of the Hebrew God."21 In our judgment the methodological basis of such opinions as these is erroneous. It must be conceded that ethnological science may aid in the interpretation of survivals found in the Bible, but it is just as important to note the difficulty of interpreting survivals with anything but minimal probability. A cultural element that does not fit the environment in which it is found is patently an older element deriving from a previous stage of culture. A practice remains in use due to scrupulous attachment to the past or as the effect of routine, but the sense of it may be lost or the directing idea obscured or altered.22 The difficulty is not in recognizing the element as a survival and connecting it in a general way with a primitive phase, but in determining its meaning in the present cultural phase. Given the fact, which no one today will deny, that these survivals are found in an environment superior to non-civilized cultures and savage mentalities, the problem consists in determining the meaning of the survival in this milieu. Nor should we forget that survivals cling longest to unprogressive elements of society. To seek the origin of the Hebrew God in rites and practices whose meaning can only be determined with minimal probability is poor method and worse logic. Also it is to overlook a whole mass of the ethno- logical data. I refer to the evidence for the early existence of high gods among primitive peoples; these do not arise out of polydaemonism, but precede it or are at least contemporary with it. In interpreting survivals it must first be determined whether they are an organic part of the environ- ment in which they are found, or whether they have lost touch with the progress of thought and become merely mechanical.23 The most reliable scientific control available in this matter is the documentary and monu- The Old Testament in the Light of Anthropology (London, 1935), 81.

The methods we have spoken of thus far must be employed in subsidiary fashion and with great caution. They are valuable only when they follow lines laid down by documentary history, when they are based on the firm foundation of the evidence from the monu- ments and the texts. This they should supplement rather than correct. Before we set about applying ethnological data to Genesis we must estab- lish certain premises regarding the position of the Hebrews in the scale of cultural progress. For the early Hebrews two broad areas of influence come into consideration, the Syro- Arabian desert and the Fertile Crescent, the first as their locus originis, the second as the world in which we find them in Genesis. Earlier method placed the emphasis on the nomadic factor. "Robertson Smith, with Wellhausen, Stade and others, took the relatively simple conditions of Arabia for their starting point."24 Lagrange long ago observed that the neglect of the Babylonian materials was a serious defect in the work of Robertson Smith, and Albright says of Wellhausen that "he neglected the new material from the ancient Orient with a disdain as arrogant as it was complete."25 The influence of this method has not run out. It is to be seen in H. Wheeler Robinson's recent contribution to Manson's A Companion to the Bible : From retrospective evidence of the Old Testament supplemented by what is known of Bedouin Arabs in ancient and modern times, we can form a picture of this nomadic background. . . . This type of religion is specially linked with natural objects concerning the life and welfare of the clan or tribe, namely, springs, trees, rocks, sun, moon and stars, together with flocks, herds and the wild creatures of the desert.26 In the very same book in the study just preceding we read : Modern research has shifted the emphasis formerly laid on the importance of the study of pre-Islamic Arab religion and social organization as the main source of light on the early religion of the Hebrews ... it is equally true that when the first wave of Hebrew settlement, represented by the Abraham saga, entered Canaan, the original nomad element had already been largely transformed by the influence of Mesopotamian culture.27 In regard to the nomadic traditions in Israel there is a possibility that they derive from other sources than the Arabian desert.28 It is rather against the background of the religious culture of Meso- potamia in the second millennium B.C. that we are to set the religion of 24 Cook, op. cit., 497. 2ß JBL 59 (1940), 92. 26 Op. cit., 2S7i. 27 S.

(264)</page><page sequence="8">The Origins of Hebrew Religion 145 the early Hebrews than in a pattern of the cult of trees, stones and sacred springs. There is any number of reasons to substantiate this. Perhaps we may mention in the first place the authority of archeology ; the fact that the Semitic Accadians and Amorites were so strongly influenced by the ma- terial and spiritual culture of the Sumerians; the Mesopotamian coloring of Gn 1-11; the obvious Babylonian influence on rites such as described in Gn 15; the resemblances to Hurrite customary law in the patriarchal narratives ; the composite character of the Hebrew race and language. Yet there are some, such as D. Nielsen, who insist that "the central nerve of Hebrew religion leads back to old Arabia."29 It is our persuasion that we are following more reliable directions when we place the emphasis in method on the culture of Mesopotamia and Canaan and attribute to the nomadic element a secondary role . It is in the effort to assay the nomadic factors in Hebrew origins that anthropology is of excellent service. In the first place we are wholly de- pendent upon the anthropologist for the proper placement of the Semites in the scheme of cultural history. According to Father Wilhelm Schmidt nearly all Semitic peoples once belonged to one of the primary cultures, that of the pastoral nomads, the great cattle-breeding peoples. However, when we meet them in history they have become, as a result of various crossings through the millennia, civilized or semi-civilized peoples of the secondary or tertiary cultures. In their natural state the pastoral nomads display a quite characteristic form of religion, not to be found in this particular form in any other culture. They steadfastly believe in and worship a supreme high-god. Although the Semites of history are distant from those of prehistory, in the judgment of the distinguished anthropolo- gist the evidence collected points to the fact that the races of the patriarchal culture, nomads and breeders of cattle, retained more of the primitive religion than any others. In their wide deserts and steppes, under the high and limitless vault of heaven, the Supreme Being became for them more than ever a sky-god, to such an extent that he seemed to amalga- mate with the material sky itself. The introduction of a social hierarchy . . . often resulted in exalting the Supreme Being above immediate and living inter- course with mankind and setting up several orders of supreme beings subor- dinate to him, by whom alone men could reach the Supreme Being himself. His dwelling-place was transferred to the higher levels of the sky. But also 29 Cf. J. A. Montgomery, Arabia and the Bible (Philadelphia, 1934), 4f. Albright feels that the reconstruction of South Arabian religion suggested by Nielsen is not to be taken too seriously. Cf. JBL 59 (1940), 91. Dhorme is of a similar opinion. Cf.

O'Hara the cult of heroes and ancestors generally reaches its most complete develop- ment in this culture, while at the same time nature-myths, especially astral, begin to evolve.30 This reconstruction, it is true, is not endorsed by all anthropologists, but it is the judgment of an accomplished scientist of exceptional achievement, and it is puerile to see in Father Schmidt nothing more than an apologist. He clarifies the matter of scientific authority when he writes : The authenticity and genuinely native origin of the beings in question is no longer disputed by any investigator of repute. The great antiquity, ethnologically speaking, of such beings is also openly acknowledged by most, and at least not seriously attacked by any. Furthermore, the number of those who attribute to them an independent origin, unconnected with animism, magic or totemism, continues to grow. A respectful body of opinion now puts their origin, if not actually earlier than these elements, at least contemporary with them.31 In view of this "respectful body of opinion" we feel that any discussion of the nomadic element that does not embrace the factor of sky-gods is in- complete and out of date. It is regrettable that we do not have a scientific exposition of the place of the sky-god in the historic Semitic culture, a correlative study of the ethnological and archeological data. A beginning has been made by Professor Albright who notes the significance of Fr. Schmidt's work in his synthesis From the Stone Age to Christianity. As noted above he feels that Schmidt has successfully disproved the unilinear evolutionary progression of Comte, Tylor, and Marett. Although his view on origins does not quadrate with Schmidt's, in speaking of the religion of man about 3,000 B.C. he says : "In each case a high god is head of the cosmos to his worshippers. So it is with the Egyptian Re', properly the sun-god ; so it is with the Sumerian An, the god of heaven at Erech, or En-lil 'lord of the storm' at Nippur and elsewhere. . . . Each of these high gods is the embodiment of goodness and power to its votaries - though we must remember that goodness was limited to its social connotations and there might be rival aspirants for power.,,32 At the same time he judges it very difficult "to distinguish sharply between dynamism and personalism, where a cosmic deity is concerned,"33 and that in some cases el may be a "more fluid dynamistic expression for impersonal supernatural power."34 We are not discussing those origins here, but we cannot omit saying that the data admit of the interpretation of scholars like Graebner, who sees the 30 Op. cit., 167f, 288f. si Op. cit., 217. 32 130. 33 125. 34 188. (266)</page><page sequence="10">The Origins of Hebrew Religion 147 effects of primitive monotheistic ideas persisting down to the highest civili- zations. These remarks have been introduced here in the interest of method. In brief, the anthropological data on high gods is a counterpoise for the data on animism, dynamism , and totemism; they must exert a mutual control . The idea of god can hardly have derived from animistic rites, if the idea of god is prior to animism in religious culture ; in the present state of research that possibility cannot be excluded. The epigraphical and monumental evidence of archeology offer the primary methodological control of ethnological data. For example the fac- tor of theriomorphism so widely witnessed by ethnology accepts control from archeological evidence. In the most ancient Sumerian art the conven- tional representation of the deity is under human form. As a matter of fact among all peoples who have attained a certain degree of culture the pre- dominant conception of the gods is anthropomorphic. In Mesopotamia the gods are superior men, and the goddesses superior women. The role of the lion, eagle, and serpent as emblem go back to the earliest period, but far from reducing the god or goddess to the status of an animal Mesopotamian art strives to give the animal a human attitude that will bring him closer to man and permit him to be associated with the religious life of humanity. The god or goddess had his or her sacred animal, but whatever the origin of it, when we meet it here it is nothing more than symbol, mount, companion or defender. It is rather by way of metaphor that an animal name is given to a divinity to indicate that he has the courage of a lion or the strength of a bull. That names are symbolic appears from the fact that they may be applied indifferently to one god or another; for example rimu (wild bull) is applied to Ea, En-lil, Nergal, and Hadad. Traces of naturism are seen particularly in representations of the goddesses of vegetation. The goddess Ishtar, for example, is represented with shoots of poppy coming from her shoulders. Is it possible to determine what idea they had of the divine powers who were venerated under these different names and forms ? This would appear from the determinative sign that precedes the ideogram or name of the gods, goddesses, demons, and so forth. This sign originally represented a star, and when used as the determinative of a god or supernatural being it is given the value "god" (Sumerian: dingir ; Accadian: Hum; Hebrew: el). However, the proper meaning of this sign is "heaven" (Sumerian: An; Accadian : Shamu). The import of this seems to be that the god or goddess, demon or hero, is assimilated to a celestial being. For that reason we find the heaven-god (Sumerian: An; Accadian: Anum) at the head of the pantheon. The great proportion of astral gods in the Sumero-Accadian (267)</page><page sequence="11">148 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara worship would explain the unification of these mysterious personages under the same sign, the star. However that may be, there can be no doubt that the evidence of plastic art points to the strong anthropomorphic character of the Sumero-Accadian religion, and to the symbolic character of therio- morphic factors.85 In the period that concerns our investigation theriomorphism is sub- ordinate to anthropomorphism ; the role of the latter is comparatively clear, the role of the former obscure. It is extremely arduous to determine the origin of totemistic traits; are they survivals of an earlier totemism, or are they general instincts of arrested development, which in one group produced totemism ? Lagrange feels that the phenomenon may be sufficient- ly explained by fear at the beginning and symbolism at the term.36 Pinard de la Boullaye feels that anthropomorphism does not derive from therio- morphism, but that they are divergent and opposite directions on the paths of civilization.87 Whatever the explanation may be, the question pertains to the science of comparative religions and the philosophy of religion. We merely speak of it here in passing to indicate how complex the question of origins can be, and how hazardous schémas consequently can be. In any event there is an absence of a dominant theriomorphism in early Israel 38 as there is everywhere in Western Asiatic civilization in the early second millennium. The thesis enjoying more favor today in the interpretation of the early religion of the Hebrews is animism or pre-animism (dynamism). Eth- nology has adduced evidence for the almost universal prevalence of animism or dynamism.89 Since it is universal in primitive religions, and since evolu- tion is seen everywhere in history, the thesis of evolutionary animism is alluring ; it is deceptive, however, since it omits making the basic distinction between religion and mythology.40 One cannot gainsay the picture that science has drawn of Semitic religions ; they are polytheistic religions mixed with elements of naturism and animism.41 Polydaemonism is also uni- versally attested among the Semites. The facts are beyond cavil; what 85 Cf. E. Dhorme, Les religions de Babylonie et Assyrie, llff., S. H. Hooke, Baby- lonian and Assyrian Religion (London: Hutchinson House, 1953); T.

(268)</page><page sequence="12">The Origins of Hebrew Religion 149 concerns us here is the relevance of the facts to the biblical critic. They must be subjected to the strictest control. A first control is to be admitted in the evidence of the high gods in primitive cultures and the possibility of the survival of that idea, particularly in the pastoral nomad culture. A second control is Lagrange's conclusion that the idea of the existence of lords (Baals) of all things, whether on earth or in heaven, is earlier among the Semites than naturism, and that the deity is not really conceived as within natural objects, since the gods are considered lords of things rather than identified with them.42 Furthermore, the marked anthropomorphism of Near East religions in the second millennium points to a personalism that is loftier than that implied by animism or polydaemonism. Add to this the fact that animism may probably be peculiar to the savage mentality rather than to any partic- ular racial or religious group and therefore cut across such groups; the possibility that it marks a degradation, that it is of a popular character as opposed to more normative religion, that it is perhaps to be viewed as embryonic science rather than as a strict religious phenomenon, leading to mythology rather than true religious progress. When these things are weighed the complex character of the case appears, and the simple applica- tion of animistic interpretation to Hebrew rites such as Jacob's anointing of the stone in Gn 28 may promptly be labeled an oversimplification in method and a crass academic anachronism. Philology is an additional con- trol. Earlier appeal to the plural form elohim in support of polydaemonism is discredited by the archeological evidence. In the derivatives of el it is very difficult to determine which forms are primary, which secondary, and caution must be exercised in founding interpretations on them. As archeology exerts control over the anthropological data, thereby setting limits to its applicability to biblical criticism, so archeology is itself conditioned by certain limits arising from its very nature. There are two broad types of material that archeology offers, epigraphical, such as the texts from Ras Shamra, and anepigraphical, such as remains of temples, cult objects, and the like. Of these, epigraphical materials are of primary meth- odological importance as appears obvious. The archeology-method of in- terpretation of biblical data is basically an argument from analogy. Recent studies on patriarchal religion have employed this method. They are at one in admitting the insufficiency of the older methods that derived the portrayal of patriarchal religion from survivals.48 They are anything but 42 Ibid., 442; 448. « Cf. A.

Note that the materials are removed by almost two millennia from the date of the patriarchal happenings, and that they come from the Graeco-Roman age in which great changes ensued in the life and spirit of the East.44 They are, of course, not so distant from the written fixation of the patriarchal narra- tives, but Alt proceeds not from these but from the ideas behind them, their unconscious evidence. He notes the frequent occurrence in Gn of the ex- pression "God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," the case namely where God is determined by the name of a person as opposed to a place or a proper name. The inscriptions he studies speak of "the god of Qasyu, the god of Su'aidu, the god of Aumus" and so forth. In the case of "the god of Aumus" he interprets his inscriptional data to the effect that a cult originally personal extended to a whole clan or district. His essential point is that the surrogate for the divine proper name continues as long as the cult continues. He concludes that Aumus founded the cult, and on anal- ogy that Abraham founded a cult to a god, who appeared to him, recalled in the name "the god of Abraham." The thesis of Alt has not received wide acceptance, although its suggestive character is acknowledged. The ma- terials he studies are significant and merit study as Lagrange long ago observed. Of Alt's thesis Professor Lods says: "There is no proof either that this mode of designating gods was distinctly nomadic . . . nor that the person named was the founder of the cult in view."45 Dhorme calls it "une théorie assez spécieuse."46 Eissfeldt says : "Scheint mir weder das im Jahrtausends v. Chr., besonders auch in Palaestina, bekannt wurden, um so weniger befriedigte jenes allein durch Rueckschluesse gewonnene Bild." Cf. E. Dhorme, La religion des Hébreux nomades , 316f. 44 Cf.

Alt himself admits that even the best analogy has limited scientific value.48 J. Lewy's study49 endeavors to adjust Alt's thesis by pointing to formulas in Old Assyrian (Cappadocian) business texts of the 19/18th century B.C., material proximate in date to the Patriarchs. He points to the following formulas of protestation that underline the sincerity of the person involved : Ašsur u Ilabrat litfulâ : May Assur and Ilabrat bear witness Asšur u ilke littulâ : May Assur and thy god bear witness Aššur u il abika littulâ : May Assur and thy father's god bear witness Ašsur u Ilabrat il abini littulâ : May Assur and Ilabrat the god of our father bear witness He concludes that Ilabrat was the "god of the fathers" of the person involved, that the god bears a special relation to him and keeps him under his protection; that the nomadic Amorites in question upon entering the sedentary culture preserved the worship of the hereditary god (Ilabrat: "the god of your/our father") alongside the worship of Assur the supreme God. Equivalent to Ilabrat in these formulae is Shaddai of the Patriarchs, "the god of the fathers," a tutelary god who accompanies them in their migrations. Both conclusions overreach by far the evidence of the premises. Albright says: "Since Ilabrat was the chief minister of Assur in the celestial hierarchy derived ultimately from Babylonia, and since there were many other deities in the Assyro-Cappadocian pantheon, one cannot help feeling that Lewy has taken too much for granted."50 As an example of Lewy's arbitrary fashion of handling biblical texts I refer to his treatment of Ex 3,2-6.51 On the whole Lewy's thesis merits the same criticism as Alt's. Edouard Dhorme in La religion des Hébreux nomades does not point to specific analogy nas do the preceding works, but proceeds along broader lines of the religious pattern of the early second millennium to which the Hebrews conformed in his opinion. Thus they worshipped the moon-god Sin, on an argument derived particularly from names like Terah and Sarah, and from the fact that Ur and Haran were cult centers of the moon-god. 47 In Baudissin, Kyrios IV, 200. 48 "Selbst die gelungenste Vergleichung hat nur beschraenkste wissenschaftliche Beweiskraft."

O'Hara We may observe in passing that in arguing for the diffusion of the cult he appeals to the occurrence of Terah and other names in the Ras Shamra texts ; this is now known to be unfounded. Also he feels that the Hebrews were not free from influence of the storm-god Hadad. In a word, Dhorme sees them as differing in little or nothing from their contemporaries. The data compiled by M. Dhorme are encyclopedic, but the specific thesis is ill-defined and the basis for conclusions not sharply drawn. In the judg- ment of H. Gordon May much of Dhorme's thesis is "purest conjecture.,,52 The last mentioned scholar considers that the Patriarchs in Canaan wor- shipped the West-Semitic deity El, the head of the pantheon. He appeals to Ras Shamra analogies, and also allows for the part played by "the God of My (Your) Father," possibly otherwise nameless, but worshipped as a personal deity ; in this he follows Alt and Lewy.53 Albright too accepts the conclusions of Alt and Lewy with some restrictions. From the Hebrew onomasticon he concludes that the principal deity of the pre-Mosaic Hebrews was a mountain god, or one invested with mountain imagery, and to the fact of a strong sense of kinship between the Patriarchal group and its god. He considers that in early popular Hebrew religion there existed a triad of the father, El, an unnamed mother-god, and the son, probably Shaddai. His view may be described as a synthesis drawn from the factors composing the environment of the Patriarchs as delineated by recent archeological research. He does not go beyond the data of archeology in this phase of his study.54 The archeological method accepts its limits from the fact that what it primarily illustrates is material culture. Religion, being a spiritual culture, involves factors that lie outside the scope of material witness, as archeolo- gists themselves admit. Admitting this fact the question naturally arises : what witness, if any, is there to factors of this kind? The philosophy of history provides the response. The end result of a process witnessed in history may demand the existence of a factor not accounted for in the material evidence provided by archeology. It is the task of the historian not only to describe the result, but to offer satisfactory explanation of its causes and origins in the historical process. Such method is described as philosophical or theological, but we see it as the culmination of science rather than a denial of it. Its relevance to historical research is axiomatic. 62 "The Patriarchal Idea of God," JBL 60 (1941), 193. 63 Cf. op. cit., 113-128. 64 Cf. FS AC 184-189. For an earlier statement cf.

(272)</page><page sequence="16">The Origins of Hebrew Religion 153 Comparative study leads ultimately to the questions : is biblical religion identical or not identical with the other religions of Western Asia? Is biblical religion marked with originality or not? If so what factors con- tribute to constitute its originality, and when do these factors first make their appearance? It is this last question that concerns us here. We are of the persuasion that the religion of Israel is marked by an originality that cannot be explained with complete satisfaction without an appeal to factors that transcend the normal and natural processes of history, truly super- natural factors. This is the persuasion of many. The point on which our houses are divided is the time and manner in which these factors make their first appearance. It is beyond dispute that the ritual of Israel resembles the ritual of Canaan, that the Code of Moses resembles the Code of Ham- murabi. There is an all too frequent tendency to consider religions similar to each other in certain respects as basically identical. This is due to an over- emphasis on the material characteristics of two religions, or the failure to see the deeper meaning underlying the material analogies.55 The utiliza- tion of existing language and ritual in no way impairs the question of originality. To awaken a profound religious response a religious innovator must employ popular ideas and accepted forms. This is to be seen in the revelation of Christ and the theology of Paul. Originality in religion as in art does not mean a jettisoning of the commonplace and the existent, but rather the investing of such forms as have the potentiality of progress with new and nobler meaning. In order to render sound judgment on the question of the original or exceptional character of a religion it must be viewed as an organic whole. It is only when it is seen as an organic whole that its progress or regress may be fairly evaluated, for the continuity of religious progress admits of periods of slow evolution, of long stagnation followed by rapid advances, and it may even have moments of apparently complete submergence.56 Such realization can only be achieved by historical perspective. The percep- tion of the organic unity of a religion may not at once be evident in its early phases, but if its exceptional character be admitted in its later stages, then a careful study of origins may look for the seeds of that exceptionality in what the record presents as the beginning of the religion. Specifically, if the religion of Israel is judged an exception or, if you will, a mutation, in the Mosaic or the prophetic stage, it is certainly allowable method to in- vestigate the record of patriarchal religion with the possibility of finding 55 Cf.

O'Hara there the first indications of that exceptionality, to see if the embryo of the organism that is the religion of Israel is to be found in the religion of Abraham. If a religion is admitted as an exception in the history of religions, the question next presenting itself is to inquire into the causes of that character. The question of causes is a philosophical one. There has been no lack of philosophizing on the causes of Israelite monotheism from Renan's con- genital monotheism to Winkler's pan-Babylonianism. Such explanations have been insufficient as their short life indicates. Into a discussion of this sort, if it is to be complete, the factor of transcendence must be intro- duced.57 In the event that natural causes fall short of explaining a religious phenomenon, appeal must be made to causes beyond the natural order of things. In our theological pattern there is place for the possibility of tran- scendent causes. By transcendence we mean the ultimate quality of a religion that places it outside the categories of purely human institutions with the limitations they connote; we do not exclude borrowed forms, human agencies, and natural imperfections, but assert that the religious complex manifests a character and dynamism that constitutes it an excep- tion to the ordinary laws of human progress. When we come to define the cause of the transcendent character we speak of divinity. It is our conviction that divinity may operate in human affairs not only immanently, but in a historically definable way; this is often spoken of as divine interference. It is interference only for that school of thought which first presents a closed definition of what the history of religions must be. Admitting the possibility of a transcendent divine causality we ask the mode of its operation, how it is effected, what it in- 57 The appeal to transcendence is not restricted to the Catholic philosophy, as is well known. R. Kittel, for example, speaks with force and eloquence when he writes : "Der historiker steht hier vor einem Geheimnis, das fast einzigartig in der Geschichte dasteht. Eine Loesung zeigt sich nur, wenn in jene Luecke ein Faktor eingesetzt wird, dessen Recht streng historisch nicht mehr zu erweisen ist. Est gibt punkte im Leben der Menschheit, wo die Geschichte in Geschichtsphilosophie uebergeht und die Speku- lation mit ihrem zusammenschauenden und deutenden Licht die sonst dunkel bleibenden Gaenge des geschichtlichen Prozesses erleuchten muss. Hier ist ein solcher. Nur eine unmittelbare Beruehrung Gottes selbst mit dem Menschen, ein persoenliches Erleben der Gottheit durch ihn, kann die wahre Gotteserkenntnis erzeugen oder den Menschen um einen wirklichen Schritt ihr naeherbringen. Denn in sich selbst findet der Mensch nur die Welt und sein eigenes Ich. Weder das eine noch das andere gibt mehr als das Heidentum; jenes eine niedere, dieses eine hoehere Form desselben."

That the mode of revelation may be properly comprehended we may define it negatively ; it is not mechanistic, it does not exclude psychological processes ordinarily, nor need it be the communication of entirely new truths in entirely new form. On the other hand it is not exclusively im- manent in the sense that, though its cause is acknowledged as divine, its mode is normal, and not particularly distinguishable from other normal historical processes. In our judgment it is above the normal in mode and is recognizable as such, for example, by the prophetic consciousness. We see revelation as more than interpretation, more than "the coincidence of a divinely guided event and minds divinely illuminated to interpret those events."58 We see it as a phenomenon of religious experience involving two personal beings, God and man. We view it as analogous to the process whereby man speaks to man. Basically it is more than a purely immanent process ; it involves the consciousness of God and the consciousness of man, for the experience of revelation is perceived not merely as proceeding from the prophetic consciousness, but as deriving from someone distinct from the personal consciousness, as the whole of prophetic literature witnesses. It lies beyond the scope of this study to give these things full treatment ; that pertains to theology, but this is the part of the theological pattern pertinent to our study, a pattern that has shown an enduring vitality and has particular relevance today. To be correlated with this development, in conclusion, is the function of the individual in the history of religions as in history generally. No one can gainsay the fact that the creators of history in the proper sense are individuals. It is to men of outstanding personality that great changes are due.59 Individuals influence religious progress, who themselves have been influenced by transcendent experiences. Great achievement in religion is not due to the nameless mass, but to individuals who assimilate the best of their cultural environment to make it the vehicle of expression of their transcendent experience and thus contribute to progress. When we speak of the experience in the patient of the divine contact, it may be described as mystical.60 Mystical experiences obviously lie outside the control of arche- 58 E. O. James, The Old Testament in the Light of Anthropology , 87f. For a critique of Protestant thought on Revelation see the very suggestive article of V. White, "St. Thomas's Conception of Revelation," Dominican Studies 1 (1948), 3-34. 59 Cf.

Much of the literature does not touch the central problems of religion. Much of it is out of (275)</page><page sequence="19">156 In Honor of Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara ology. They are testified to by the biblical record, and a full discussion of the data of the Bible takes us beyond archeology. There is no indication of such mystical experience in the other records of the ancient East.61 The method therefore must be theological and positive ; theological in the sense that its rests upon a basis in metaphysics, namely, that the religion of Israel, as distinguished from the religion of the Patriarchs, is a historical fact that is sufficiently explained only by appeal to transcendent or super- natural causality. Now the precise question: is it allowable on scientific grounds to integrate patriarchal religion with the religion of Israel and see it also as marked by transcendent qualities ? The method must be positive with primary emphasis on archeology. We feel that recent research has reduced the ethnological method to a secondary role, and demonstrated that it requires strict archeological and documentary control. We consider the cultural milieu of the Fertile Crescent in the early second millennium B.C. more significant than analogies deriving from the religion of desert nomads. Lastly we consider the archeological method definitely limited by reason of the essential character of its argument, namely, analogy. John J.
