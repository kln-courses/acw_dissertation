Chogyam Trungpa Act in haste, repent at leisure. proverb Festina lente (hasten slowly). an Augustan and Renaissance motto-injunction While an art student working on anatomy, well before entering university and study in the history of art, I noticed puzzling anom- alies of proportion and rendering in Michelangelo's giant young David [Fig. 1]. His magnificent achievement and mythic reputation as a consumate master of male anatomy notwithstanding, these eccentricities confounded my adolescent expectations: the antico and Donatellesque outsized head and hands, the similarly mature-looking but ill-matched body frame and musculature, the deep yet unsteady Late-Classical chiastic stance, the tensely inhaled chest yet relaxed-looking lower abdomen, and, especially in the context of this study, the large, inflated, knotted, breast-like pectorals with quasi-centered nipples. Just how aberrant these elements are we can See by comparing them with the mimetic nat- uralism of Leonardo's small sketch of the David, which benignly rectifies his young rival's "readymade" [Fig. 2].1 Eventually I understood such distortions as traits of deep- seated haptic or expressionist temperament, especially in artists attracted to the elemental and numinous art of sculp- ture, Michelangelo's repeatedly confessed calling. His literally hands-on comprehension differs radically from Leonardo's more coolly sublimated and objective optical-impressionist orientation-one essentially visual, the other somatic.2 I sub- sequently noticed polymorphic breasts similar to those of the David in other early works by Michelangelo and thought it an idiosyncratic trait, perhaps taxonomically useful in a Morellian way for attribution, like the schema and detailing used by Greek vase painters.3 When I saw reproductions in the popular press of the Michelangelesque Cupid "rediscovered" in Manhattan [Fig. 3]-a selectively, fortuitously(?) unfinished and mutilated fragment of a fetching young archer Cupid-Apollo-Hercules [hereafter "Eros"]-and noted its kindred large soft pectorals and other more blatant hallmarks of Michelangelo's early and later work, I thought to myself: The telltale trait, again! But was a sure attribution to Michelangelo possible? There have been so many pretenders.4 What follows in text and annotation are thoughts about the origins, aura, and ambience of the "Eros" and sundry other connections concerning works by Michelangelo, ultimately as 79</page><page sequence="2">SEYMOUR HOWARD ,f. ?; i'? t , e ' v~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 &amp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~( r.fk 1 'Icr ~~? bq ~t~i 5 1) Michelangelo, &lt;&lt;David), ("the Giant"), 1501-1504.

Ango also makes a smaller, pointed off, and more accurately proportioned prepara- tory(?) sketch of the "Eros" [Fig. 5; see also Fig. 6, reconstruction].13 * * * 1902 Bardini, a Florentine art dealer administering the sale of Borghese antiquities, illustrates and publishes for sale at Christie's in London the "Eros" fragment [Fig. 7], acquired by him from the Borghese collection, and identified as (1) a "Statue d'enfant... Travail de Michel- Ange" (French edition) and (2) "The Infant Hercules... School of Michelangelo" (English edition). For want of a buyer, Bardini withdraws it for 100 guineas.14 Schubring in a news release describes the "Eros" favorably, but rejects the attribution to Michelangelo because it appears to be made from more than one block, which was not his practice, as noted by Vasari.15 1905 Jandolo, a Roman dealer, sells the "Eros," with its bat- tered antico or Greco-Roman (?) tripod base, to the enterprising American architect and decorator Stanford White, as the excavated ancient fragment of a young Hercules.16 7) Michelangelo(?), (&lt;Eros,.

Draper there identifies Ango's preliminary sketch of the "Eros" [Fig. 5].29 2000 Gaborit, in a small monograph accompanying its exhi- bition at the Louvre, reviews the evidence and suggests that the "Eros" may be (a) by a Michelangelo contem- porary working under Bertoldo, (b) by a Mannerist fol- lower simulating Michelangelo's work, or (c) a work apart by Michelangelo himself.30 Each of the above proposals has its virtues, but whether any of the works cited after Vasari or Bardini's 1902 publica- tion of the "Eros" is the Galli Cupid by Michelangelo or whether it has an alternative authorship and subject remains controversial. EROS And now Love, the limb-loosener, stirs me: Irresistible, bittersweet imp... Sappho But I won't be stung. So keep your honey-bee and keep your honey. Sappho31 Eros-love, life itself, for Homer a metaphysical force impelling Zeus to Hera and Paris to Helen-was first personified by Hesiod as a chthonic deity, born of Chaos after broad- bosomed Earth (Gaia) and subterranean Hell (Tartaros), but before the creation of Night and Day. As a higher generative prin- ciple of unmatched beauty and appeal, Eros attended the birth of Aphrodite; he could unite all things, loosen the limbs, and even change the minds and bodies of younger Olympian gods.32 In later cults, as the fairest and most merciless of gods, who conquered all, Eros became the child of Aphrodite and Hermes, Ares, Herakles, or even Zeus, sharing in his parents' virtues and vices, giving direction and meaning to life and a sense of cos- mos to the universe, along with a complementary piqueing dis- quiet. His nature was further amplified and articulated in Anteros (his mate), Pothos (longing), Himeros (desire), and dreams of love and death embodied in related complements, Hypnos (sleep) and Thanatos (death), children of Night. Eros eventually wed his anima-counterpart, Psyche (soul, spirit, breath). Demeaned in Late Greek and Greco-Roman myth, Eros became a capricious, mischievous child, an implicit goal and means, who as Cupid, Amor, or the Erotes could ignite lovers of all sorts. From early on, these included homoerotic ones, who celebrated Eros as a symbol of freedom and the ideal in palestra, battlefield, and fraternal enclaves, as described in Plato's Symposium and Phaedrus.33 There his power, long before Ficino, was linked with abiding beauty-initially in carnal lust and then in more sublimated realms of friendship (philia) as well as in still more lofty spiritual aspirations toward an ultimate good in idea, higher form. That realm in later Neoplatonic modes of Christianity became agape, the spiritual pursuit of God.34 As a cardinal principle of life and generation, Eros had many guises in Classical antiquity and thereafter.35 Much of this surviving and revived imagery was well known during the Renaissance, when concepts of love were elaborated upon in an intricate continuum of Christian, chival- ric, and Moorish esotericisms manifested in theology, astrolo- gy, alchemy, iconography, and other constructs of magical and mystical as well as more practical day-to-day thinking.36 In the fashionable Grecophile court and Platonic "Academy" of Lorenzo the Magnificent, begun for the literary arts by his grandfather Cosimo de' Medici, Michelangelo learned first-hand about the philosophic bases for sacred and profane manifestations of Eros and Love. From Marsilio Ficino, the Renaissance Plato; from Pico della Mirandola; and from the broadly ranging scholarship of Cristoforo Landino and, especially, Angelo Poliziano, he learned of Platonist, Aristotelian, and a wide spectrum of other Classical or classi- cizing sources, also known to him through poetry from the Ancients to Dante and from Petrarch to Lorenzo himself.37 The visual legacy of this antiquarian tradition was the province of the learned court sculptor Bertoldo di Giovanni, Lorenzo's friend and Michelangelo's mentor. * * * Love... young, tender, flexible or rather agile, well-propor- tioned, and handsome... soft, delicate, and tender.

Michelangelo, poetic fragment, 1501-150239 Given this background concerning antique and modern aspects of love in his life, we might expect of Michelangelo, at the outset of his first sojourn in Rome (1496-1501), a work with the subject, form, and characteristics of the "Eros." At that time, it could have played any or all of the following roles for him: 85</page><page sequence="8">SEYMOUR HOWARD 9) Michelangelo(?), &lt;&lt;Eros,. Left profile.

Eros [Figs. 9, 10]-made for his "own pleasure" (and future sale) following upon an aborted Apollo commission for Piero de' Medici, who had suggested Michelangelo's suc- cesful antico forgery of a Sleeping Cupid as a Child, bought by the powerful Roman antiquities collector Cardinal Raffaele Riario (della Rovere), cousin of the future Julius II. (Riario, duped but curious, with the aid of the banker Jacopo Galli, his neighbor, then brought the twenty-one-year-old sculptor to Rome, supported him for about a year, and started him working on his over-life-size drunken young Bacchus [Fig. 11])40; (b) An exultant Eros reminiscent of antiquarian inventions by Bertoldo and his master Donatello's exuberant Amor- Angels and joyous children and ephebes, generally,41 but with a characteristic festina lente check and balance of thought and action, expressed in its head, body, and limbs. It should be noted that the bow at or under his feet (See Manilli and Ango) suggests that the "Eros" may be viewed either as returning or withdrawing an arrow to or from the opened quiver (or about to close the quiver), pulled up (a la the David) on the left shoulder by the edge of the pelt, and/or its strap(?), with his right hand, apparently once secured with a dowel in the large drill hole on that shoulder [Figs. 3-7, 9, 10]42; (c) A seductive androgynous pubescent beauty with Platonic academic and pederastic appeal, displayed in the idealizing Greek heroic nude, competing with antique and contemporary antiquarian sculpture in a venerable paragone- demonstration learned from the ideal and prurient interests and ambitions of the Medici court, "Academy," and pagan sculpture garden in sodomite-ridden Florence43; (d) A self-revealing essay on Love, the Christian and pagan totem-leitmotif, so dominant in the lyric and dithyrambic visual and poetic imagination of Michelangelo, who "all his life seemed in love with the idea of love," as Hibbard so neatly put it44; or (e) A compound allusion to personal identification not only with Eros, but with Apollo and Hercules, as an ideal generic young archer with a wing-like lion-paw quiver and a bow, signifying the power and acuity of the artist and refer- ring as well to his bow-driven sculptor's drill.45 Yes, subject, history, approach, and, as we shall see, simi- larities in detail to works ascribed to Michelangelo reasonably encourage, but hardly prove, his authorship. If only the cha- racter, quality, and intensity of its rendering and expression unequivocally approximated that of his Bacchus or approached that of his Vatican Pieta! In the absence of hard evidence, ascription ultimately relies largely on empathy and expectation. These guides to understanding are both valuable and suspect, to be used with caution and acknowledged. 11) Michelangelo, &lt;&lt;Bacchus,&gt;, 1496-1497. Marble, 203 cm.

Fra Angelico cited and described by Vasari (1565) Like love, empathy presumes a suspension of self or ego, an identification with subjects, ultimately to know and under- stand them, their arts, and the very nature of things. Biologically, the capacity for empathy is virtually essential to our survival. Psychologically, empathy involves projecting con- sciousness in order to feel, think, breathe as another. In its modern form, the concept derives from visual art, from attempts to understand purpose and meaning in its mute, mimetic, and abstracting language-from simple illusionism to hidden niceties such as entasis, proportion, composition, and the like. Gestalt, intellectual closure, and synaesthesia, a shar- ing or correspondence between the senses, are at its core.46 Empathy can be experienced vicariously by acting out, role playing, or aping poses or states of being in art and nature.47 Examples of its mind-body knowing-evident in pos- tures of Vedic Yoga, dance, and statuary; Stanislavsky's method-acting; sensations of a phantom limb; enigmas of psy- chosomatic medicine; autosuggestion; or the "second nature" derived from habitual practice-are legion.48 The capacity for such identification and transference underlies the therapeutic purge and purification of catharsis possible in the arts, espe- cially in the mimetics of drama, as explicated long ago for the virtues of Tragedy in Aristotle's Poetics (1449B. 28-31).49 Through training and temperament, empathy was espe- cially important for Michelangelo, who was schooled in Hellenic and Platonic idealism, generally, to represent the essential form or nature of his subjects. In his case, this approach was conveyed most purely and profoundly by the nude male figure, physically, kinetically, through body lan- guage, a carnal complement to intricately cerebrated and often esoteric allusions ultimately derived from literary sources encouraging idiosyncratic fantasy.50 The empathic process is fundamental to appreciation for all makers and re-creators of art, including art historians and critics. Despite our ostensibly selfless immersion into the sub- ject of investigation, prejudices of memory, experiential and genetic, ultimately generate a projected pathetic fallacy in connoisseurship: Truth is whatever I (or we, as a constituency) feel, sense, expect, and believe.51 Virtually all candidates for "lost" or "unrecorded" works by Michelangelo have been contested and eventually rejected-as pawns of taste, commerce, reputation, and politics, as well as evolving research. You judge. Do the empathic as well as tech- nical powers evident in the "Eros" seem sufficiently authentic to fulfill your expectations of the Bacchus or Vatican Pieta master? Who is your young Michelangelo? Just how "divine" was his head, heart, and hand? I confess that for decades now, espe- cially after seeing his figurines in Bologna, and after sustained work with Hellenic sculpture, I have held no inordinately high expectations for his early work or much of its aftermath, for all his dexterity, learning, and might of expression. EXPECTATION The road to hell is paved with expectations. modified proverb However much enlightened and objective, immersion for self and a like-minded constituency by historians and critics is inevitably colored by taste, temperament, and experience. Resulting hobby horses of explanation, for us problem solvers, smack of egoistic rationalization and have historically led us to erect houses of cards giving only temporary support in the face of time and changing views. We are well served by more impartial evidence, from laboratories, archives, and comparison with proven works. Its limitations notwithstanding, such evidence does help us to test, validate, and re-think theory and hypothe- sis.52 Expectations, as well as available evidence and practical considerations of professional reputation and the marketplace, naturally affect and reflect judgment, as can be seen from the spectrum of arguments that do or do not ascribe the "Eros" to the still-contested early style of Michelangelo, or other possibilities.53 ASCRIPTION Connoisseurship: the art of ascribing fine student work to masters and poor masters' work to students. Anonymous The answer is the thing in itself. a metaphysical tautology The "Eros" appears to combine many attributes recently argued as characteristic of Michelangelo's early work.54 His traits in the "Eros" are obvious: Compare, for example, its head and hair to the Bologna Kneeling Angel [Fig. 17], the Manchester Madonna angels (contested), aspects of the David [Fig. 1] (as Bardini suggested), and the Louvre Dying Slave.

Sundry other items of minutiae, such as the navel, eyelids, torsion, shifting stance, selected mutilations, and unfinished passages, also recall Michelangelo's detailing, especially in the similarly antico and androgynous Bacchus and its boy Satyr.55 In addition, the "Eros" pose virtually duplicates that of Bertoldo's nude bronze statuette Apollo [Fig. 8]56 and resem- bles aspects of Bertoldo's thin-hipped and long-legged Saint Jerome, his nude Suppliant, his bronze Battle Relief [Fig. 15] standing corner figures (especially the male one, lower right), his striding young winged Erotes in the Poggio a Caiano entry frieze,57 and likely sources for both artists at the Camposanto in Pisa58-all of which might encourage an attribution to either Bertoldo or his student. The above works can of course have been known to a copyist, imitator, or forger. Like other pieces once ascribed to Michelangelo, the "Eros" from the outset has been believed to be made by contemporaries or followers working under his influence. Recall that, well before his death, Michelangelo's sculptures became Academy models in Florence; studio aides and others copied and enlarged upon his sketches; so did others working in his manner; by 1873 a virtual facsimile had successfully replaced the David at the entry to the Palazzo della Signoria, without comment. Remember, no document securely identifies the "Eros" as by Michelangelo. But, to judge from the remnants of sharp, arrow-point-like, drill holes marking crests and troughs that articulate the "Eros" [see Figs. 9, 10, 12], as in other works by Michelangelo and by members of the studio of Benedetto Maiano, with whom he was apparently familiar, it may in fact have been pointed off from a model by him or an aide, rather than being an improvi- sation by a Mannerist or later admirer who exploited the shift- ing tastes for works by Michelangelo, from Bernini to Rodin.59 Consider, among the latter possibilities, a hypothetical case for Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, the gifted and prodigious eighteenth- century Roman restorer, a pyrotechnic copyist, pastiche maker, forger, and art dealer [Fig. 13], whose art historical ken and chronologically arranged art collections, including supposed bozzetti by Michelangelo, were much admired by his friend Winckelmann.60 Cavaceppi owned, sold, and revamped various works ascribed to Michelangelo; he claimed to exceed Michelangelo's ability as a trained antiquarian and restorer; he 13) &lt;&lt;Studio of Bartolomeo Cavaceppi&gt;&gt;, 1769.

Like most artists and collectors in Rome, Ango surely knew Cavaceppi's open studio and his collec- tion. Giovanni Bottari, who wrote the first Capitoline catalogue and, in his annotations to Vasari (1759-1760), commented with zeal about the importance of Michelangelo's missing Galli "Apollo" noted by Aldrovandi, was apparently a first-hand source for Cavaceppi's attribution to Raphael.64 Their interest reveals not only traditional commercial intricacies but a new and infectious nation- alism in Rome by Cavaceppi and his circle, that was then coupled with early modern scholarship in the history of art65 and an awak- ened Early Romantic interest in Michelangelo by Natoire, Fuseli, Reynolds, and their contemporaries. Such data may indeed relate to invention or intervention contemporaneous with the Titi and Ango information of the 1760s. But to my knowledge no clear ref- erence to the "Eros" or its reproduction appears among the many Cupids, Apollos, Herculeses, and unidentified torso fragments in Cavaceppi's extensive inventories of antiquities, copies, casts, and modelli. Moreover, the stripped and savaged fragment now bears no unequivocal telltale signs of his facile hand or his studio. Neither does the "Eros" show, in its present condition, any clear signs of Cavaceppi's equally unscrupulous younger col- league Vincenzo Pacetti, president of the Academy of Saint Luke, an effective but drier sculptor-restorer and successful dealer-administrator in charge of renovations and acquisitions for the Villa Borghese antiquities collection after 1775. Nor, thus far, can it be traced to the studio of any of the many anti- quarian restorer-copyists then dominating the Roman art mar- ket.66 Besides, there is the matter of Manilli's 1650 description, which was more reasonably a source of identification prompt- ing display in the Capitoline Museum than the basis for a forg- er's or copyist's invention, though, as noted, that possibility cannot be excluded with total certainty. A priori, given its recent vagaries of provenance and tangled problems of ascription-involving, especially, Bertoldo-a hypo- thetical modern master of the "Eros" would seem more likely to have been informed by research on the young Michelangelo and his circle, which had developed by the end of the nineteenth cen- tury. The hand, eye, and resources of Bardini might reasonably be suspected to have been involved in the preparation or manu- facture of the "Eros" as a fragment. Bardini was a practiced restorer and authenticator of Renaissance work, and a well- known dealer in fakes as well as genuine antiquities. Before the turn of the century he was administering sales from the Borghese collection, and apparently he was well acquainted with its hold- ings and inventories, including that of Manilli. He had recently sold a spurious Michelangelo "Apollo" from the Borghese collec- tion (identified by Manilli) to a major client, Wilhelm von Bode, Director of the Berlin Museum, who published extensively on the work of Bertoldo during the 1890s and later wrote very critically about Bardini's practices.67 The progressively compromised stature of the "Eros," at first lavishly described as by Michelangelo, then as from his studio, and finally as an anony- mous antiquity sold to White at a bargain price through the Jandolos, also points to questions of inside information (and ignorance?) about its origins, fragmentation, and repair.68 Is, then, the "Eros" a marble enlargement of Bertoldo's Apollo composition-made Michelangelesque by combining aspects of the David, Bacchus, Bologna Angel, Manchester Madonna angels (from the Borghese collection), and Bargello Apollo-an eclectic antico pastiche judiciously aged and repaired for or by Bardini, rather than an eclectic work by Michelangelo, a precursor, or a Renaissance to Early Modern follower? A tempting hypothesis. But there is the obstacle of Ango's drawings, made along with dozens of studies by him after Michelangelo; and, as with an eighteenth-century attribu- tion, Manilli's description of 1650, as well as the cumulative weight of other formal and iconographic evidence. Here, again, circumstantial evidence is hardly proof. And, unfortu- nately, the Bardini papers will remain sealed for some time.69 In any case, whatever its origins may be, for almost a centu- ry the "Eros" in a differently "pristine" condition-of unrepair- has stood as the crowning feature of a lavish and charming eclectic pastiche, an invented ensemble of art historically minded dealers and decorators of "Gilded Age" taste in North America. * * * Since its "rediscovery," skeptics and believers alike have bemoaned the condition of the "Eros," as well as aspects of its rendering and conception. In 1999 a laboratory report appeared describing its possible quarry of origin, the condition of its marble rind and core, and the chemistry and manufacture of its metal doweling-all of which point to fifteenth-century and later possibilities. Neither carbon dating of any remaining organic material in the repairs nor infrared or ultraviolet differ- ences in the original, damaged, and reworked surfaces have yet been reported. The latter is especially important about the left shoulder, where the strap end is trimmed away, but should join the quiver, like the other strap end; the dowel hole area connecting the pelt and right hand is fragmented; and the unfinished and reworked quiver was attached to the body with an apparently modern dowel [see Figs. 3, 6, 7, 9, 10].70 Note: Laboratory comparisons with the marble and especially with the metal doweling of the kindred but cruder Michelangelesque fragment of a Hercules(?) in Yale may conceivably prove infor- mative [Fig. 14].71 Surface damage to the "autograph" detailing 91</page><page sequence="14">SEYMOUR HOWARD 14) Michelangelesque, ((Hercules with a Lionskin?,(?), 16th C.(?).

There is always more to understand. For now, and for posterity, the varied Rashomon-like per- ceptions of the "Eros" and its kin in our projected fugues on the fugues of Michelangelo and his interpreters, it seems to me, are as important historically and humanistically as are proofs of its origins and authorship. BREASTS OF MICHELANGELO The wet nurse was the daughter of a stonemason and was also married to a stonemason. For this reason Michelangelo is wont to say, perhaps facetiously or perhaps even in earnest, that it is no wonder that the chisel has given him so much gratification, for it is known that the nurse's milk is so powerful in us that often, by altering the temperature of the body which has one propensity, it may introduce another, quite different from the natural one.

This phenomenon is espe- cially notable as both letter form and breast plumage in the mor- bidly witty cypher-hieroglyph identifying his Macel de' Corvi ("slaughterhouse of crows") address (and self-identification?) in Rome [Fig. 16], which accompanied almost fifty similarly ghoulish, fruitful, nourishing, and suggestively loving epitaphs dedicated to his widely-admired young friend and probable paramour, Ceccino Bracci, who died at age fifteen, in 1544.81 In his male-dominated world, with its still somewhat repressively taboo and glorifying chivalric view of women, Michelangelo's female figures, based almost entirely on the study of male nudes, are at times rendered in his sketches without breasts or nipples, and in finished work retain aspects 24) Michelangelo, (&lt;Head of a Satyr-Crone&gt;&gt;, c. 1531(?).

This pattern of thought Freud clinically observed and explained at length as a ubiquitous "polymorphic perverse" component of creative genius in his beloved vehicle for psychoanalytic and psy- chogenic theory, the biography-novella on Leonardo.85 Polymorphism-a primal, archaic form of visual metaphor which at once defines and fuses like powers in unlike subjects, as in the Centaur, Triton, or Androgyne-is a first and elemental step in an evolving process eventually leading to pantheism, such as the seamless Mosaic and philosophical mystic uni- verse characterizing much in Michelangelo's late beliefs. Michelangelo's breast forms are for the most part canonical in his large program pieces and other selected works [cf., e.g., Fig. 18]. They are also often age- and task-specific-nubile to opulent, as in the virginal and carnally awakened Sistine Ceiling Eves; frightfully distressed or desiccated as in tragically worn or hag-like nursers, such as Night [Fig. 23] and the mother satyr in Infant Bacchanale; and obscured or wan, especially in his old age, as with the late Crucifixion studies.86 Like the man himself, breasts in the works of Michelangelo are, to be sure, richly com- plex, multivalent, and overdetermined, fascinating and repug- nant in form, subject, and meaning-in a word, "sublime," as his Romantic admirers might say, or "ridiculous," as his pro- Raphael Classicist detractors might counter.87 * * * Human beings once had three sexes, Masculine, Feminine, and Bi-sexual. Ficino, citing Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium88 Two related suites of works illustrate especially well Michelangelo's idiosyncratic and visionary patterns of associ- ation in erotic and lactocentric, Madonna and Child-like, meld- ings of repressed fantasy and orthodox illusionism. Take, for example his drawing in acid dark brown gall ink of a seductively beautiful and androgynous-looking Leonardesque youth [Fig. 19], his nape hair indented a la "Eros," which was a prototype for various comely male and female heads.89 Note how closely it compares with its often- paired, bizarrely metamorphosed, and antithetical-seeming descendent, where the youth's head and body are trans- formed into a grotesque and complementary phantasm, Triton [Fig. 20], a symbol of pagan license and instability.90 The mon- ster's profile head of a Hag or Elder, wearing a Hermes-like helmet, resembles analogues on the first sheet and other of Michelangelo's early sketches.91 Still more queer is the chest, bizarrely modeled as male above and female below, where "breasts" that spring from the modeling of the youth's lower ribs double the sex. The genitals and hips are also of equivo- cal gender, primarily male. In addition, the monster's limbs are not fins with fishy scales, but squiggly and snake-like, resem- bling the phallic sheath of the coy and impish goat-legged satyr boy who helps to support Michelangelo's Bacchus and, more distantly, the viperous-Satanic temptress with Triton-like legs who seduces the Sistine Ceiling Adam and Eve or her aquatic kin in minor art grotesques and small bronzes sec, for example, a Triton-Harpy once offered for sale by Bardini [Fig. 21].92 Three male heads (three ages of man?) appear sideways on the "Triton" sheet [Fig. 20; turn 90 degrees left]. The two beard- ed and balding men, especially the elder one below, are akin to a central head on the first sheet and an earlier(?) Triton or Satyr mural sketch once in the Villa Buonarotti at Settignano.93 These bearded men (with the central head of the first sheet, strangely identified in the literature as self-portraits of Michelangelo, then 98</page><page sequence="21">EROS, EMPATHY, EXPECTATION, ASCRIPTION, AND BREASTS OF MICHELANGELO . - .4 26) Anonymous, &lt;Leda and Swan,, c. 1550.

The affec- tive impact of his throat-baring abandon resembles that of the "Eros" and the ecstatic surrender of the Dying Slave. When the sheet is vertical, that young man's outlines, turned on their side, metamorphose into another fortuitous-seeming doubling, an anamorphic quasi-caricature of a swinish nursling, whose fea- tures are enhanced with suggestive sketch-like doodles resem- bling cryptic and taboo associations found elsewhere in Michelangelo's work [e.g., Fig. 18; n58].94 The third sheet [Fig. 22], perhaps a copy, at once more removed and integrated, has a Madonna whose profile view resembles that of the initial pretty boy [Fig. 19] and a muscular reclining infant Jesus, who dramatically turns, serpentine fash- ion, seemingly to and from his mother and her breasts. Between the two is the pale canted rendering of a bearded man, apparently another wretchedly tortured self-portrait of Michelangelo, with his characteristically cocked head.95 As noted, instances of Michelangelo's obsessive concerns with drink, hunger, fasting, and "intoxicating" nurture in his life, art, and poetry are both numerous and intricate.96 * * * Even more revealing and enigmatic is a group of mature works related to the celibate and insomniac Michelangelo's erogenously loaded and profoundly disquieting and charac- teristically tortured, "serpentine" figure of Night, with its hideous engorged, tumorous(?), and widely-spaced breasts [Fig. 23]. These semi-amorphous accretions are part of a fig- ure based upon idealized anatomical studies of a wiry male body and a small triangular head type, apparently derived from the comely profile of a young woman with an elaborate coiffure once ferociously metamorphosed into a similarly pro- filed diabolic Crone or Satyr head [Fig. 24].97 Her architecton- ic starred diadem becomes a quasi helmet; her massive Medusa-like braid changes into a fetishistic turd-like phallus; and her nipples suggest an abbreviated apparition of coital conjunction involving glans, phallus, vagina, eye, and anus, 99</page><page sequence="22">SEYMOUR HOWARD .41Y~~~ ? , t ._f' . ?; ?E"?

The composition is another outrageous paragone apparently expanding upon the ancient pathos for- mula also used for Night, preserved in a thin, dry, and far more reductive Greco-Roman decorative sarcophagus relief proto- type [Fig. 26].

But it was prudently, facetiously, withdrawn, conceivably recognized as too archly self-revealing and too overtly erogenous an image-precisely Aretino's meat.102 Reduced, abstracted, and made into a grotesque fanta- sy, this bestial image of the primal scene has a condensed and displaced analogue in the slithering gyrating auto- erogenous melding of animal bodies and organs in Michel- angelo's polymorphic and syncretic vision of a Dragon or Salamander [Fig. 27].103 Its essentially androgynic grotes- querie is repeated in closely related and equally regressed kin [see, e.g., Fig. 28].104 These expressionistically trans- formed images of repressed lust, fear, and rage, echoing Archaic idioms of bestiality and prefiguring metamorphic surrealism, also bring to mind Martin Schongauer's 100</page><page sequence="23">EROS, EMPATHY, EXPECTATION, ASCRIPTION, AND BREASTS OF MICHELANGELO engraved polymorphic monsters with cloacal display bedeviling St. Anthony, which Michelangelo copied and inventively painted as a young adolescent in the studio of Ghirlandaio.105 Further abstracted and sublimated, this ubiquitously eroti- cized undercurrent of cerebral and somatic counterpoint appears as pure or "significant" form in Michelangelo's sculp- turesque and anthropomorphic architecture. To a lesser extent, it recurs in the often heavy-laden quasi-mimetic and fantastic detail that he used for decorating both bodies and buildings-again, influential models for subsequent Mannerist and Baroque taste.106 Apart from a sanctioned professional improvisatory gam- ing with structure, design, iconography, and patronage, with its own ebulient and insidious momentum, we may ask whether Michelangelo's playful-prideful over-compensating phantasms of conjunction were consequent to his monkishly repressive and self-righteous celibate abstinence and fast- ings. Are they polymorphic sublimations of narcissistic and latent or repressed bivalent or homoerotic lust, impelling industry and affecting its form? Perhaps so, if only in part-the most taboo and libidinously motivating part.107 In this connection, Marcel Duchamp's self-consciously "pop" and esoteric Postmodern "bachelor's" quest for a multi- valent self-assessment, informed by Freud and by an amused smutty alter ego stripped bare in Rrose Selavy-a partial paro- dy of Leonardo's kindred Eros and, inadvertently, Michel- angelo's more darkly shaded Dibbuk-makes an instructive parallel and contrast.108 CONCLUSION In sum, the Manhattan "Eros" is replete with links to the hand, mind, eye, and ambience of Michelangelo. But his authorship of this mixed aggregate is not proven. Ultimately ascription depends upon the strengths and weaknesses of empathy and expectation joined with a wealth of supportive but inferential evidence.109 Whoever its author may be-and certainly Michelangelo among a host of others seems for now the most likely candidate-its androgynous and variously autobiographic attributes, including breast formulae (accessi- ble also to forgers and simulators), tally with recurrent poly- morphic aspects of Michelangelo's sanctioned and taboo interests expressed with, and as, a generative force that inspired his life, art, and times. This imagery, sublimated in hermetic and grotesque phantasms doted on by his elite patronage, was ultimately influential and prophetic for aspects of Mannerist and Baroque affectation. 29) Maureen Lomasney, &lt;&lt;www.pieta.com)&gt;, 1998.

Its bitter- sweet, tragi-comic resonance contributes beyond words to the leavening power and meanings latent in both improvisation and icon. Better than most, the work illustrates the explosive associations of meaning latent in the just word and image.

Italicized notes (nn, n) are internal cross-references. Article titles in anthologies are abbreviated. Michelangelo's sculptures and paintings not illustrated can be found in Baldini n4, Hibbard, and other general studies in the immense litera- ture on the artist. * My thanks to Dr. Grabski, for requesting this essay and for his patience and continued interest in its publication. This study was first sketched as a note in 1996, when the Payne Whitney statue emerged in the popular press. The introductory paragraphs still pre- sent its essential arguments, but the text has been enlarged consider- ably after further exploration into their ramifications and study of sub- sequent information on the sculpture. The inquiry has benefitted from the literature and from conversations with Drs. James Beck, Kathleen Weil-Brandt, Paul Castelfranco, James Draper, Colin Eisler, Jay Feldman, Melvin M. Lipsett, James M. Sacks, Mrs. Jocelyn Morris, and, as ever, Ilia Howard, who helped to edit the manuscript. I would also like to thank the following persons for help with photographs and permissions: Dr. Giovanna G.

Relevant background matters concerning antiquarianism, patronage, collecting, restoration, forgery, and related technical informa- tion are treated in my anthology Antiquity Restored (Howard 1990); psy- chogenic matters concerning empathy, experiential knowing, polymor- phisms, androgyny, autoeroticism, lactocentrism, and the like-relating to creativity and autobiography, sublimations confronting chaos, in what Kris described as a salutary "regression in the service of the ego"-are more pointedly discussed in Art and Imago (Howard 1997). 1 Kenneth Clark, A Catalogue of the Drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci... at Windsor Castle, Cambridge, 1935, p. 100f., no. 12591 recto (c. 1504? conversion into Neptune, as an afterthought?), with a sec- ond perfunctory sketch of the David figure type in black chalk below; E.

Detlef Heilkamp ("The Youth of Michelangelo: The New York Archer Reconsidered," Apollo, 151/460, June 2000, pp. 27-36), whose article appeared after my paper was completed, briefly reviews the Florence exhibition and catalogue, notes Bardini's practice of rework- ing antiquities, finds the Archer quiver unresolved and reworked and its placement incompatible with Aldrovandi's Galli Apollo description (cf. n8), links its pose to a Lysippic Dancing Faun type, and believes it is by an anonymous and still unformed follower, but rightly allows that Michelangelo's unknown and concealed early practices may yet yield surprises. Eros 31 The Love Songs of Sappho, tr. Paul Roche, New York-Toronto, 1966, nos. 109 (addressed to another woman, concluding: "But, Atthis, you have come to abhor me/[even the hint of me]/And flit to Andromeda"), and 118 (a recurrent metaphor in the Renaissance: cf. Wind, pp. 89-92, stings, fetters, and sweetness of love, e.g., in Piero di Cosimo and Botticelli, sources for Michelangelo). 32 Hesiod, Theogony, tr. R. M. Frazer, Norman, Oklahoma, 1983, pp. 31f., 37f. (commentary on lines 116-125, 201, Eros as the active creative generative principle). In his instructive antiquarian cosmolo- gy, Freud initially linked Eros to carnal lust, and later, more broadly, to the affirmation of life as opposed to death, Thanatos. 33 For the history and iconography of ancient Eros, see August F. Pauly and Georg Wissowa, Real-Encyclopadie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, Stuttgart, 1907, XI, pp. 484-544, 493-497 (liter- ary references), and other encyclopedias on Classical imagery. Eros as a symbol of freedom was associated in ancient Athens with the Tyrannicide lovers Harmodios and Aristogeiton, commemorated by their noted monument in the Agora (Pausanias 1.8.5). Their bond descended from Dorian, Cretan, and Spartan military practices in which older warriors were protectors of young soldiers, a tradition recalled in the love that handsome young Alcibiades extended to Socrates, his old satyr-looking protector in arms, during Plato's Symposium (another source for Michelangelo's republicanism?); cf. Condivi, p. 105 (Michel- angelo on the chaste-Platonic love of Socrates and Alcibiades). For love as a rebellious alternative to authoritarianism, see Donald Posner, Antoine Watteau, Ithaca, New York, 1984; Howard 1997, p. 310. (Both artists, it appears, also closely paraphrased their own figure types.) 34 Agape: Anders Nygren, Agape and Eros, tr. Philip S. Watson, Philadelphia, 1963; cf. Plato, Symposium, 178B, 199C, passim (Eros ascending to the good, idea, spirit); also Michelangelo/Saslow, pas- sim, e.g., nos. 166, 260-276 (Michelangelo and the risen soul or love in his Neoplatonism). 35 Of the ancient Eros-Amor-Cupid images, whose traditions were possible resources for Michelangelo's improvising paragone, probably none, as with the Bacchus, were wholly replicated in his Galli Cupid (the "Eros"?): See, e.g., Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae, Zurich and Munich, 1986: Antoine Hermary, Helene Cassirmatis, and Rainer Vollkomenez, "Eros," in III/1: pp. 850-942, nos. 1-1020, 111/2, pls. 609-668, passim, esp. nos. 79b (Eros Centocello type), 80a (Praxitiles Apollo Sauroctonus as Eros), 332-361 (as Archer), 352ff.

For entree into Michelangelo's philosophical rationale con- cerning love, see esp. Marsilio Ficino's Commentary on Plato's Symposium, tr. Sears R. Jayne, Columbia, Missouri, 1944, which deals in passim with love and love's manifestations for Plato, who equated it with God, the beautiful, the good, and justice (cf. n34). Much of Ficino's commentary, a disquisition combining scholastic and philo- logical learning with esotericism and mysticism of an ancient, medieval, and Renaissance sort, was translated into Latin and Tuscan by 1476 (ibid., pp. 18, 38) and may be viewed as an intellectual model and apology for much of Michelangelo's life and art. For a relevant sampling in the context of Eros, see, e.g., Love born of Chaos, citing Hesiod (p. 125f.), Love creating Cosmos (p. 128), as the All (p. 148ff.), as ruler of the arts (p. 150), as beautiful and good (p. 164).

Note: Bardini's tripod base for the "Eros" suggestively recalls the Donatello Amor-Attis base. 42 See the Augustan festina lente motto and emblem in Aldus Manutius's Dolphin and Anchor impresa, repeated here and there in Colonna's Hypnerotomachia (n36), where the principle is also acted out in a hieroglyphic image (h vii) with a precariously seated and comely young woman balancing in a contrapposto of polarities- action and restraint, lust and chastity, sacred and profane love-as she looks to the raised bow-shaped wings (of Eros?) that she holds while elevating a turtle in the other hand; she also lifts a naked unshod leg while being stabilized by the modestly draped other leg (see fur- ther Wind, p. 103f., fig. 54)-a recurrent motif of simultaneous pru- dence and daring, of paradox and polarity, in the art and life of Michelangelo. White's turtle waterspouts, which supported the strid- ing "Eros," serendipitously contributed to a festina lente flavor in his decorative fountain ensemble.

For a curious and instructive contemporary inversion of the allure found in the "Eros," see the nude Lolita-like prepubescent girl quasi- pornographically posed, waxed, polished, and otherwise cosmeti- cized in Richard Prince's photograph Spiritual America (1983, Whitney Museum of Art; reproduced in Lisa Phillips, The American Century, London, 1999, fig. 466). The shifting sexuality of a Leonardesque drawing of a girlish Young Bacchus(?) (Wilhelm Suida, Leonardo und sein Kreis, Munich, 1929, p. 194, fig. 229, Pseudo Boltraffio, Girl's Head, Venice, Accademia; Leonardo da Vinci 2000, San Francisco, 1999, pl. 9, Leonardo) and a Giovanni Bellini-like boyish Young Courtesan (Fritz Heinemann, Giovanni Bellini e i Belliniani, Venice, 1959, 368, pi. 412; Bernard Berensen, Italian Pictures of the Renaissance: Venetian School, London, 1957, I, p. 11, pi. 45, Bartolomeo Veneto, Frankfort, Staedelsches Institut), with their com- pany, makes a more compatible overture to polymorphous taste in Michelangelo's time. See, too, Maerten van Heemskerck's depictions of the Palazzo Sassi courtyard, in Irving Lavin, "David's Sling and Michelangelo's Bow: A Sign of Freedom," in Past and Present: Essays on Historicism in Art from Donatello to Picasso, Berkeley, 1988, pp. 42-46, figs. 52f. (Saint Luke Portraying the Madonna and Child, Sassi courtyard in background, painting; Rennes) and 54 (Sassi Courtyard, drawing; Berlin). The painting shows Michelangelo as a celestially vaunted sculptor working feverishly amid Sassi antiquities. These sculptures might well have influenced his Cupid (the "Eros"?) and other early work: fragmented images of the Apollo Sauroctonus (rear view), Bearded Dionysos Supported by a Satyr Visiting an Actor (relief), an indolent Apollo Kytharos with his belly protruding like the Bacchus, and a seated porphyry Apollo restored as Roma, perhaps influencing the Bruges Madonna as well as Jacopo Sansovino's Madonna and Child. 44 Hibbard, p. 230; cf. Panofsky n36, p. 194 (Michelangelo's Victory over Vice as Love Conquers All). For Michelangelo's multivalent Eros, the sexuality and latent homosexuality evident in his poetry, imagery, and life variously addressed by his biographers, see, e.g., Hibbard, passim, esp. pp. 229-233 (a balanced review and assessment, concluding, like most others, that Michelangelo sublimated in work his intrinsically homosexual proclivities [rationalized by Neoplatonism]), also p. 231 (arguing, contra Creighton Gilbert, that Michelangelo's sen- sual interest in breasts in an early sonnet [no. 20; cf. n86] is not a sign of intrinsic heterosexuality).

Beck, Three Worlds of Michelangelo, New York and London, 1999, pp. 143-154 (a conserving Positivist review of Michelangelo's ret- icent sexuality and control of his appetite). 45 Eros often wears or reclines upon Hercules' lionskin, a sign of his dominion even over the usually prudent and paradigmatic strong- man-hero in realms of his prodigious and vulnerable sexuality: e.g., his fertilizing fifty virgins in a night and his conquest of and by Queen Omphale and Deianeira. The cut off and isolated paw appears in an alchemically oriented title page of the first French edition of Colonna's Hypnerotomachia (n36), where the usurped totemic power also sym- bolizes castration, incipient death, and putrifaction (Beroalde de Verville, Le tableau des riches inventions...

Brandt, in Giovinezza (p. 97, fig. 3; p. 412f. figs.; no. 78a), associates the attribute with feral [bear paw?] quiv- ers in Pollaiuolo's Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (London, National Gallery), Near-Eastern quivers collected by Lorenzo, and pouches holding sculptors' tools; Gaborit (pp. 26-28) relates it to an animal hide quiver in Botticelli's Athena and Centaur (n80) and various North Italian dynastic escutcheons. Note, too, Giovinezza, p. 54, figs. 1, 4 (a crossed lion paw escutcheon on the Milanese family palace neighboring the Palazzo Medici). For Hercules and Florence, see Leopold Ettlinger, "Hercules Florentinus," Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Instituts in Florenz, 16, 1972, pp. 119-142, 137f. (Michelangelo's Hercules). Michelangelo's bow as his sculptor's drill is well known; its relation to his identifications with Eros, love, and other powers is not. Michelangelo's identification with Cupid is from the outset regularly invoked in his own poetry (see Saslow, in Michelangelo/Saslow, p. 45); see further ibid., pp. 41-47, for his sources in Lorenzo the Magnificent, Dante, Petrarch (especially), Poliziano, Ficino, et al., who invoke Eros. Cf. ibid., no. 34 (the Archer, Cupid, and Death linked), nos. 65, 90, 120, 175 (Archer), and passim (darts of Cupid); also the drawing Archers for Cavalieri (Windsor, no. 12778, Hartt, no. 362), with 108</page><page sequence="31">EROS, EMPATHY, EXPECTATION, ASCRIPTION, AND BREASTS OF MICHELANGELO its own Riario-like(?) sleeping, dreaming Cupid. Lavin n43, pp. 29-61, 268-274 (Michelangelo's association of the David with Freedom [cf. Vasari/Bull, p. 338], with Lorenzo's Republicanism, and with the bow and artists' genius and acuity). Brandt (Giovinezza, p. 90-97) variously links the "ErQs" to liter- ary and graphic images of Cupid, androgynous and otherwise, Phoebus Apollo, Hercules, the Sun, Hermes, Dionysian ecstasy, and (with Lavin) the archer as a symbol of artists' acuity; and she links left- handedness in the "Eros" with that in the David (cf. Hibbard, p. 56f., left-hand orientation of David and prototype Nicola Pisano's Fortitude, in Pisa). In conversation Dr. Brandt has observed that the "Eros" pose resembles images of Diana, which is clearly compatible with its other androgynous attributes. She also suggests, with Caroline Elam, that the "Eros" may have been made before 1496-1497, when Michel- angelo was much occupied in Rome, and even before 1494, when he was in Bologna and still under the influence of Bertoldo (d. 1491); cf., too, Beck, p. 29f., and Gaborit, p. 40f., for difficulties in precisely dat- ing the "Eros" in Michelangelo's oeuvre.

See, too, early Romantic pre- decessors in the synaesthetics of Winckelmann and Goethe and their forerunner-models in ancient art-e.g., in J. J. Pollitt, The Ancient View of Greek Art: Criticism, History, and Terminology, New Haven and London, 1974, esp. pp. 201-209 (phantasia theory). 47 I am grateful to the late Peter von Blanckenhagen, who in the classroom introduced me to the Central European archaeologists' device of kinetic reinactment, to demonstrate pre-mimetic subtleties to be experienced in the pose of Myron's Diskobolos or Polykleitos' Doryphoros, a method subsequently applied to experiential compre- hension of other canonical masterworks of sculpture, and furthered in psychodrama, Far Eastern, and mind-body practice. Chironomia, dance, mime, drama, and tableau vivant postures are part of the genre; see, e.g., "Archaizing Postures" (1980) and "Archaisms and Attitudes" (1984), in Howard 1997, pp. 209-216, 217-228. 48 Mind-body enquiry, with its vast literature in holistic medicine, now begins to emerge in art historical body-centered research. Physical therapists regularly demonstrate the power of imaging to effect motor response. Dancers and athletes speak eloquently about a memory in musculature, to know in one's bones-as in driving, walking, and tai-chi or Yoga asana practice, world-wide experiential ways of learning and healing. 49 Michael Davis, Aristotle's Poetics, Lanhom, Maryland, 1992, p. 35f. (tragedy), 37 (Politics 81342a.5-16, a related purgation and purifi- cation from music). 50 For Michelangelo's empathic, kinetic, and rationalizing prac- tices, so amply demonstrated by his visual and literary art, as noted by commentators in dealing with his polarizing imagery, see, e.g., Condivi, p. 23f. (plural sources for his Bacchus [cf. Pliny N.H. 34.69, Praxitiles' Bacchus and Drunkenness]), 99 (berating Durer's illustra- tions of proportion, with stick-like bodies lacking what is important, gesture and movement, hence animating passion), and samplings reviewed by Hibbard, et al., passim. 51 For the art historian, critic, and chronicler compared, see "Winckelmann's Daemon," in Howard 1990, pp. 162-174; and "Iconology, Intention, Imagos (1996)," in idem 1997, p. 427f. Expectation 52 In work on restoration and fakery of antiquities, I find that com- parison, laboratory, and archive information can variously assist, hum- ble, deceive, or do precious little for the hungry eye. For expectation related to anticipation, hypothesis, and "mental set," see Gombrich n3, passim, p. 227f. (close to my meaning) and p. 450. 53 On professional and sociological forces affecting "Eros" ascriptions, and by extension other heavily laden attributions, see, e.g., Eisler, p. 12; Beck, passim, esp. pp. 15, 21f., 34f.; and my "Fakes, Intention, Proofs and Impulsion to Know: The Case for Cavaceppi and Clones," in Why Fakes Matter: Essays on Problems of Authenticity, ed. Mark Jones, London, 1992, pp. 51-62. Cases of individual and group projection and distortion are, of course, ubiquitous.

This Lorenzo the Magnificent-oriented subject, of continued interest to Michelangelo, is based upon a 5th-C. panegyrist, Claudian, identified by Ulrich Middeldorf, "Giuliano Sangallo and Andrea Sansovino," Art Bulletin, 16, 1934, pp. 107-115; Draper, p. 200.

A witting pursuit by Michel- angelo of original Greek models in literary sources and visual images-as in the Pisa funerary stele in the Donatellesque Madonna of the Stairs (see n58), the Bacchus, and improvisations upon the Laocoon and Torso Belvedere-should be a fertile arena of investiga- tion. 58 For possible resources in Pisa, viewed in terms of Michelangelo's legendary synthesizing and syncretic powers of eye, memory, and imagination (claimed by and through Condivi, p. 107), see Roman sarcophagi recorded in the Camposanto since the four- teenth century: Paolo E.

Did the "Eros" master in his work point off a Bertoldo Apollo-like model (see Fig. 8) or the Manchester Madonna angels' out- lines? See similar small drill hole points of articulation and outlining in photographic details of Baldini n4, 1973 and 1981, passim, and Giovinezza, p. 54, fig.

Such drill holes anticipate small metal points insert- ed in plaster models by Canova for pointing off marble sculptures. On pointing off sculptures with a copying machine to replicate a model, by Michelangelo and, more usually, his assistants, see, e.g., Giorgio Vasari, Vite..., ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1876, I, 154 (squaring device), VIII, pp. 152-156 (squaring for David); Rudolf Wittkower, Sculpture Processes and Principles, New York, 1977, pp. 30-32, fig.

Brandt (p. 353) notes use of a fine-grain claw chisel for model- ing some "Eros" details, as used by Michelangelo. The long thin curling tendrils in the "Eros" and Bacchus temple hair show similar forms and drill-work facility. See, too, Suzanne B. Butters, The Triumph of Vulcan, Sculptors' Tools, Porphyry, and the Prince in Ducal Florence, Florence, 1996, pp. 189-214 (tool manufacture and maintenance in Florence, including Michelangelo, who made his own tools), figs. 52f. (tools illus- trated). Michelangelo faulted Donatello for his lack of finish on close viewing (Condivi, p. 28), implying comparison with his own highly pol- ished works, whose cloying morbidezza and sweetness contrasts with his later process-revealing non finito sketchwork, a welcome respite inviting viewer imagination, like the ancient fragments with which he competed and from which he learned. See also Vasari/Bull, p. 404f. (Michelangelo's perfectionism and the non finito), and Kris and Kurz nl, p. 48, on the value of the invention and non finito as a sign of artis- tic prestige, citing Vasari, Aretino, Kris, and Venturi.

Professor Paul Castelfranco informs me that his father, Giorgio Castelfranco, believed that the Palestrina Pieta was probably made by Bernini, who at age nineteen was reportedly engaged to restore it; cf.

The Archivio Segreto, Vatican Library, contain- ing Capitoline records, recently opened with the aid of the late Carlo Pietrangeli, firmly document other restorations by Cavaceppi: cf. Maria G. Barberini, "De lavori ad un fauno di rosso antico, ed altre sculture del Museo Capitolino (1736-1746)," Bollettino dei musei com- munali de Roma, 7, 1993, pp. 23-31. Note: Ango made drawings for Breteuil of reproductions of the well-known Young Centaur and Old Centaur in the Capitoline Museum (Yachitz-Koehler n26, figs. 8, 17); these antiquities were restored in part by Cavaceppi and were also represented in his collection in several versions: Howard 1958/1972, pp. 158, 166f., 426 (restorations, copies, bronzes, bozzetti, casts, and cast molds); Cavaceppi n60, I, pp. 26, 27. 63 Howard 1958/1972 n60, pp. 179-186 (1775-1787, anonymous fragments as well as restored antiquities and inventions), 374f.

Edgar P. Bowron and Joseph J. Rishel, Philadelphia Museum of Art, London, 2000, no. 141. The modern head and the cuttings to receive the right foot in Cupid with a Hippocanth (a pastiche or inven- tion from the Cadogan collection[?], formerly in the Bath art market, and probably "restored" by Cavaceppi), are even closer to the "Eros" details, but, as with other of Cavaceppi's improvisations or restorations, are hardly the basis for a firm attribution to his hand. Note: its several drill holes are not usually present in Cavaceppi's pointed-off work. 65 Roman nationalism and scholarship: Seymour Howard, "Bartolomeo Cavaceppi's Saint Norbert," Art Bulletin, 70, 1988, p. 482f.; idem, "Albani, Winckelmann, and Cavaceppi: The Transition from Amateur to Professional Antiquarianism," Journal of the History of Collections, 4, 1992, pp. 27-38, esp. pp. 32-34.

Samples of soil and adhesives were saved, but have not yet been reported upon; they might be important, especially to help date the attachment of the right arm. X-ray and metal analysis showed that a presumably older, softer hand-made zinc-based dowel was set into the right arm stub with lead, and machined galvanized steel dowels, presumably of Bardini's time, connected quiver of the same marble to the left shoul- der and the legs to the base. Comparisons showed that the marble probably came from a quarry opened before 1415. For marble quarry origins and dating-benefits and limitations-see, generally, studies in the journal Archaeometry and introductory samplings in my "Observations Concerning the Antiquity of the Getty Veristic Head and the Authentication of Ancient Marbles," California Studies in Classical Antiquity, 7, 1974, pp. 165-174, and "Site Variation in Provenance Studies: The Carrara Marble Example" (with T.

(Athletic Fragment, Yale University Art Museum, c. 1550-1530, bought in London 1961, reviews of suggest- ed authorship, subject, and dating). Note: the pectorals and thin chest strap are close to the "Eros" and David; there are no articulating small drill holes; the work seems artificially broken and battered; the clumsy lionskin perhaps refers to Michelangelo's lost Hercules of c. 1492-1493 noted in Condivi, p. 15.

Note: Was the dowel holding the right arm of "Eros" used by Michelangelo? (hence a work composed of more than one block, pace Vasari; cf. Michelangelo's studio[?] preparation for the restora- tion of Laocoon's right arm; n78) or was it used for a restoration before, after, or during the time of Ango? The method of attachment was common in additions to a sculpture by inventors and restorers, as seen in the restorations of Cellini and Classical antiquities. Did left- handed Michelangelo ever give the "antiqued" Bacchus (n83) or his(?) "Eros" a right hand? It is not present in either of Ango's sketch- es of the "Eros." 72 Surface damage: see Brandt, passim; Giovinezza, pp. 101- 103, 300, 305f.; and "Louvre 2000: Programme trimestriel janvier, fevri- er, mars" [Louvre Bulletin], cover, over life-size enlargement of profile and upper chest (detail).

The latter is a crude and eccentric gesso model, supposedly for Michelangelo's David. Both fragment and model have similarly puffed pectorals with centered nipples. Beck (pp. 15, 38, nn. 4, 90, figs. 10, 21) reasonably rejects them as works by Michelangelo.

The cupped "C"s dipping well below the written line also graphologically indicate corporeal lust and greedy retentive avarice. Michelangelo's letters are written in an oth- erwise canonical italic secretarial script. See also, in context of the female crow, the bi-sexual Cellini's amusing anecdote wherein he brought a beautiful young boy in woman's clothing to an artists' party in Rome gathered by one Michelangelo [di Bernardino] of Siena. He outshone the token women, whom the artists called "crows," much to the delight of the host and the others (The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, ed. Charles Hope and Alessandro Nova, tr. John Addington Symonds, Oxford, 1983, pp. 35-39, 210f. nn. 81-85). 82 For Michelangelo's females with male origins, see, e.g., Hibbard, passim, and British Museum preparatory study for Venus and Cupid, with a phallus and no breasts (Wilde, no. 56); British Museum Bruges Madonna sketch, with perfunctory breasts, no nipples (Wilde, no. 5; Hirst, p. 27, figs. 37, 38); Madonna and Child (Louvre no. 689 recto; Hartt, no. 58); Sistine Ceiling Sibyl sketches; Ashmolean Museum Standing Male (or Female?) Saint, with equivocal pectorals (K. T. Parker, Catalogue of the Collection of Drawings in the Ashmolean Museum. Vol. II: Italian Schools, Oxford, 1956, no. 307 verso; Hartt, no. 158). See also the women in Archers and Crucifixion of Saint Peter (n86). In the same vein are Michelangelo's many studies in which the genitals are hidden, omitted, or smudged over, apparent- ly indicative of decorum, defense, and cathexis; for related mecha- nisms used by his early Romantic adorant and imitator William Blake, see "Blake, the Antique, Nudity, and Nakedness" (1982), in Howard 1997, pp. 140-194, passim, and pp. 151, 189. 83 Female breast drapery corollas: Vatican Pieta, Doni Tondo, Bruges Madonna, Pitti Tondo Madonna (note: the Manchester Madonna has a breast exposed within a vaginal mandorla shape). See, too, a similar corolla formula used by Michelangelo's early ally, Francesco Granacci, for the Rest on the Flight to Egypt Madonna (Hirst n14, 44f., pi. 35 [1494; Dublin]), and the Madonnas by Michelangelo's "associates" in the Vienna Academy and Kress Collection, New York (ibid., 39f., pls. 24f. [late 1490s]). Note: The young Saint John in the Vienna Tondo vaguely recalls the "Eros" head and upper body; his phiale also makes a better original model for the Bacchus restored kantharos, which Wind (p. 178f., figs. 97-99; cf. n71) rightly argued may be a gauche later restoration; cf., too, its cande- labrum core with the vase support in Ango's drawings (Figs. 4, 5). For related amphora vase types by Michelangelo, see two British Museum drawings (Wilde, nos. 27 verso, 30 recto) and decorative vase reliefs in the Medici Chapel (Baldini 1973 n4, p. 101, fig.). The support scheme recalls that of Praxiteles's Knidos Aphrodite and its many descendants: drapery falling on and about a surrogate vase type, a cleansing womb-shaped hydria (see n43 for other, more taboo, links to the Knidia). Male corollas of folds: Bologna, Arca di San Domenico S. Procolo, S. Petronio, and Angel (Fig. 17; head type resembles Young Caracalla); and Siena Piccolomini Altar Saint Paul, by Baccio di Montelupo, after Michelangelo[?] (Giovinezza, nos. 37, 40). The Bacchus and David areolae and raised nipples are concentric target- like rings; the "Eros" has no areola or strongly raised nipples. See also Liebert, pp. 160-164 (Sistine Ceiling androgynous god with female breasts, separating light and darkness.

See also Liebert, pp. 137f., 245, 258 (Michelangelo identifications with Saint Matthew, Night, and Leda). Note: the long narrow eyes of the Madonna and full-faced angel in the Manchester Madonna resemble those of Michelangelo's portrait sketch by Daniele da Volterra (Condivi, p. 147 n. 130, frontispiece; Haarlem, Teylers Museum). For a strangely obsessed and relentless discrediting of a "Mut"-"Mutter" detail in Freud's popularizing novella-like study of Leonardo, castrating (for like minds) the patriarchal Chronos who informed his own work, see "Freud and Leonardo, an Art Historical Study" (1956) and "Further Notes on Freud and Leonardo" (1994), in Meyer Schapiro, Theory and Philosophy of Art: Style, Artist, and Society, New York, 1994, pp. 153-192 (1956), 193-199, 195 (a moment of concession), 198 (the typo-"Freudian" slip "kindship" [sic] retained); see also p. 187 (challenge for a promised better art histori- cal psychoanalytic approach). For a general review of the controversy, see Laurie Schneider Adams, Art and Psychoanalysis, New York, 1993, pp. 14-40. 86 For a spectrum of breast types, see, in addition to various Madonna and Child and other lactation-oriented scenes, the Fall of Phaeton women (British Museum, Wilde, no. 55; Venice, Accademia no. 177; Windsor no. 12766 recto: Hartt, nos. 355, 357, 358); the Sistine Ceiling Eve, progressively enlarged in the Creation of Adam, Creation of Eve, Temptation, with its female snake (n92), and Expulsion from Eden (prelactating and hidden); the Sistine Ceiling Cumaean Sibyl; the Last Judgment Saint Catherine, once nude, bla- tantly voluptuous, and seemingly sodomized by Saint Blaise, and sub- sequently bowdlerized and fully draped (Liebert, p. 340, figs. 18.8- 18.9); Maria Rzepinska, in discussing the possible identities of "Eve" in the Creation of Adam, briefly comments in passing upon the variety of female breast forms used by Michelangelo ("The Divine Wisdom of Michelangelo in the Creation of Adam," Artibus et Historiae, 29, 1994, pp. 181-187, n. 20). See also the drawings of several seated women: (a) the pow- erful and voluptuous frontal view of a mature Sibyl-like Seated Woman in Armor with a prior cryptomorphic(?) minuscule profile study of a nude man under her right hand leaning over and looking toward her crux (Fig. 18; her cuirass is akin to and probably descended from those worn by the Medici Chapel dukes) and (b), verso, Seated Woman, a semi-profile, very ample, and gentle-looking view of the recto subject in a thin blouse (British Museum, Wilde, nos. 41 recto and 41 verso); (c) a (contested) frontally seated and comely but wall- eyed woman with a mirror and a transparent blouse (Windsor no. 12766 verso [recto the Fall of Phaeton for Cavalieri]; Hartt, no. 369; Christoph L. Frommel, Michelangelo und Tommmaso dei Cavalieri, Amsterdam 1979, pi. 15, by Cavalieri?; cf. Cleopatra verso, infra and n104); and (d) a Seated Young Woman with a Spindle, with another cryptomorphic(?) large, faint, and simplified profile of a man's head under her left upper arm looking toward her held crux; conceivably she is the Fate Clotho, spinner and generator of life and destiny (British Museum, Wilde no. 40; Hartt, no. 368, linked in a suite with a- 114 c, nos. 366-369). Wilde rightly likens the young woman's head to the boy's head in Fig. 19 and Ashmolean P327 verso as well as to related studies, including male and female ones noted among prototypes for the head of Night in n97. See too the ample breasts in the presentation drawing for Cavalieri, Cleopatra (Casa Buonarroti no. 327R; Hirst, p. 116f., fig. 235); the Venus, Mars, and Cupid (Uffizi 598Er; Hirst, p. 112f., figs. 220-221); the Sistine Ceiling Flood fallen mother with madonna- like head cloths, straps beneath her breasts, and a weeping weaned(?) boy behind her; cf. also the "spent breasts" of Night (Hibbard, p. 191; n97). For Michelangelo's late, evanescent, and flat- tened unisexual breasts and bodies, see his last sketches and Crucifixion studies (Hartt, nos. 419-441); also his Archers and Crucifixion of Saint Peter; n82. On related patterns of old-age style, see Howard 1997, p. 240. See, too, Michelangelo/Saslow references to breasts in nos. 3 (Dantesque), 4 (a la Petrarch and Poliziano), 20 (rustic beauty with watermelon-sized breasts followed by the author with a cup, a bur- lesque a la Poliziano and Lorenzo); also no. 67, lines 113-115 (a polit- ically duplicitous and amplitudinous wet nurse); no. 68, lines 25ff. (another gargantuan predacious hag with great breasts, who waxes on others' misfortune, nursing an infantine giant and their son; cf. Lorenzo's description of Jealousy, the aftermath of love, linked with Hesiod [Thieme n36, pp. 143-145], and Ripa's 'Jealousy," the evil opposite of Eros). See, too, contrasts in Lorenzo's poem "Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne," joining Amor, Bacchus, and satyrs in an Epicurean saturnalia (Thiem, pp. 162-164). For the vicious and viper- ous aftermath of the motif, see, e.g., "Identity Formation... Bernini's Early Maturity" (1979), in Howard 1997, p. 126ff. On norms of Classical, Golden Age esthetic excellence (hence truth, beauty, and justice) as derived from observation and a rendering that approaches infinite number and measure (hence detail and com- mensurability), see Galen on Polykleitos and his "Canon," the Doryphoros (Pollitt n43, p. 89). 87 For Michelangelo's reputation and character, see again nl; Condivi, passim, esp. pp. 99-108, and Vasari/Bull, passim, pp. 387 (work on St. Peter's gratis), 417-430 (anecdotes a la Douris about Michelangelo); both make heroicizing characterizations and record- correcting defenses countering sundry earlier slanders made against the 80-year-old Master, then mellowed by age and apparently living the philosophical life of Socrates as described by Ficino (n36, 217ff.).

For more recent, jaundiced assessments of his character and "virtues," see Paul Barolsky, Michelangelo's Nose: A Myth and Its Maker, University Park and London, 1990; Eisler, passim, esp. 8f.; Beck, p. 41 n. 71 (critical of anti-hero trends), and idem n44 (a fresh and canonical assessment of his earthy and mordant Tuscan wit and his erudite ambitions toward the divine). His talent, energy, palpable greed, and grandiose idealistic aspirations for "divine" fame made Michelangelo (who would become a hubristically usurping and vulnerable Phaeton-like father substitute</page><page sequence="37">EROS, EMPATHY, EXPECTATION, ASCRIPTION, AND BREASTS OF MICHELANGELO for his siblings and his own father; cf. Liebert, p. 288f.) Julius Il's "man to match (his own) mountains" of ambition graphically, in the Sistine Ceiling, the pope's colossal bronze portrait in Bologna (destroyed), and their project to build his colossal tomb for St. Peter's nave that would have rivaled the Mausoleum of Halikarnassos (Pliny, N.H. 36. pp. 30-31), as a wonder of the world. These traits together with Michelangelo's powers of learning, his accomplished artistic integrity and ingenuity, his political insight and connections, and his adminis- trative skill all contributed to his being the right man at the right time and place. For a pithy and representative selection of historical views on Michelangelo, see, in brief, lan Crofton, A Dictionary of Art Quotations, London, 1988, pp. 111-112 (e.g., Cellini, "The divine Michelangelo Buonarroti, prince of sculptors and painters" (1558-1567); El Greco, "He was a good man but did not know how to paint" (cited in 1649); Fuseli, "The women of Michelangelo are the sex" (1789); Delacroix, "... the artist's exclusive absorption in [anatomic detail] is of a charac- ter in which the only passion is their own" (1864); and Mark Twain, "I do not want Michelangelo for breakfast-for dinner-for tea-for sup- per-for between meals" (1869). Indeed, we do each make our own Michelangelo. 88 Marsilio Ficino... n36, p. 155, Speech Four, "On the Original Form of Man," ch. 2 (quote followed by "... they were whole, but because of their insolence when they aspired to equal god they were cut in two."

For a similar eagle-helmeted man, with a scorpion chinstrap and a crouching grey- hound-salamander-griffin crest, see the Warrior: Hamburg, Kunsthalle no. 21094 (Hartt, no. 119). It is akin to the British Museum Duke of Canossa drawing (Wilde, no. 87, studio copy), ostensibly representing Michelangelo's titled ancestor and indicative of his aristocratic preten- sions (Condivi, p. 6) with a comely profile (see below) and a feathered helmet representing a grotesque and malicious-looking equine raptor with an opened jaw, crouching greyhound-salamander crest, and breastplate bearing the head of an angry man with a simian underbite; see further grotesque polymorphs in n104. For the beautiful profile face type, see, e.g., the leg-embraced Doni Tondo ephebe, Sistine Chapel Nude over Jeremiah amid fes- toons of polymorphic genital and breast-like Della Rovere acorns, a helmeted and androgynous female head (British Museum, Wilde, no. 42 recto), and Cleopatra (n86). 92 See (a) the Sistine Ceiling Temptation "snake," in Jane Shuyler, "Michelangelo's Serpent with Two Tails," Source, 9,1990, pp. 23-29 (linked to Lilith, the Cabala, and Ficino); (b) pre-figurances of the Bacchus satyr boy in similar diabolically provocative split-hoofed satyr teaslings in Piero di Cosimo's Bacchus Discovers Honey; (c) Triton-like grotesques in the pediment spandrels of the Lorenzo de' Medici Tomb in the New Sacristy; (d) the sundry Tritons and aquatic erotic grotesques in minor arts and in small bronze Tritons and Harpies, esp. in Wilhelm von Bode, Die italienischen Bronzestatuetten der Renaissance, Berlin, 1907, I, pls. 44 (Satyr, Woman), 50 (2), 56 (all by II Riccio); II, pls. 120 (vase relief), 144 (Alessandro Vittoria), 166, 167, 170 (Venetian, c. 1575, male and female), 173, 174 (Jacopo Sansovino? door knockers), passim [see too Bertoldo's Battle Relief, I, fig. 9, and Apollo, I, pl. 10; see n57]; and, in particular, (e) the kindred small Renaissance(?) bronze of a female Triton or Harpy with short wings, no arms, two spiraling snake legs, and pendulous breasts in Bardini n14, pl. 3, no. 35 (here Fig. 21), and its English Christie's cata- logue entry, p. 34, no. 203: A support, by Pietro Tacca [1577-1640; Tacca attribution unlikely], formed as a bifurcated winged female monster-4 1/4 in. high-on fluted rosso-antico marble base-Florentine, early 16th Century (No. 35, pl. 3) [handwritten price "5-" (pounds) "10 -" (shillings)...

See, too, Christ and the Woman of Samara (Geneva, Bodmer Foundation); Hirst identifies the moment as illustrating John 4.10: 'Jesus said unto her...

Hibbard, p. 225 (male models for female figures a contemporary practice; n82). See, too, for the head of Night, Michelangelo's demonic Satyr-Crone Head (Louvre no. 684 recto; Hartt, no. 304; Fig. 24), with warts, goiter, hooked nose, beard tufts, and a triangular face like Night, drawn heavily in ink over the student Antonio Mini's(?) chalk sketch of a Night-like woman with heavy braids, metamorphosing it into a grotesque polymorphic mask. See too the Satyr-Crone Head undersketch and another student's study of the Mini prototype in a New York private collection (Hirst, figs. 17, 18) and, also, a similar profile head in Michelangelo's Seated Young Woman with a Spindle, the Fate Clotho? (n86). All are ultimately related to a Leonardesque prototype (Fig. 19). Jocelyn Morris, who saw this paper in manuscript in 1999, then pointed out to me that the breasts of Night look cancerous. I submit that Renaissance champions of Night's physical beauty may have been partly blinded by the momentum of a mystique, decorum, and phenomenon akin to the legend of the Emperor's (nonexistent) clothes and the mannered prejudice of an acquired taste for the amaro, as with an aperitif. 98 For Dali's similar and witting use of erogenous "polymorphic perverse" (to use Freud's term) aggression, see "Duchamp, Dali, Tzara, and Dadaist Coprophilia" (1990), in Howard 1997, pp. 195-206, esp. 199f. (his Soft Construction with Boiled Beans: Premonition of the Civil War, combining breast, turd, phallus, and bread in a modern visual essay of personal and social "psychomachia," projected as Civil War, along with related inventions). Such polymorphic fusions of breast and phallus, etc., a now-commonplace Freud-informed means of pop cul- ture-are used, e.g., by Robert Crumb, an especially arch practitioner (see, passim, Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gurnick, High and Low: Modern Art and Culture, catalogue, Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1990). 99 For the owl, mask, and feigned sleep of Night, see, e.g., the owl-historically a sign for witch, night hag, and Athena as a phallic woman-in Rocke n37, p. 223 (owl as an anti-Savonarola sign for the phallus, bardossa). The lascivious mouth motif appears, e.g., in imps and erotes in Piero di Cosimo's Bacchus Discovers Honey; Botticelli's Venus and Mars; the Doni Tondo midground transitory figure of the young Saint John the Baptist (covert; cf. too its preparatory drawing in Louvre 688 verso); and Annibale Carracci's Venus and Cupid; see also John T. Paoletti, "Michelangelo's Masks," Art Bulletin, 74, 1992, pp. 423-440 (the mask in Night and other self-portraits). In theme, form, and polymorphism, Michelangelo's sketch Fica (Archivio Buonarroti, Florence) is closely related to Night (c. 1526- 1531), Leda (c. 1530), and other works cited here. The outline self-por- trait of Michelangelo, encased in a totem boar's head recalling antico helmets, confronts the pendant profile of an elegant mature woman wearing a snake-like coiled cap. Her beaded blouse, closed at the throat, is fully open below, revealing two spent pendulous and phallic breasts with elongated nipples whose erectile tissue projects from and penetrates into the mammary mass, as with Night. Between the two actors is a hieroglyphic-like (cf. n42) sinister-left hand with its thumb thrust into the tight space between the limb-like index and long fingers, the chironomic sign of coitus-hence the title, Fica. (En face, the ges- ture would resemble the nipples of Night.) At bottom right are two vari- ant and abbreviated outline studies of the profiles. The woman has been evocatively identified as Vittoria Colonna and with Michelangelo's poetic, ambivalent, and polarizing sentiment, "The fairest of the fair, howe'er ugliest" (Robert J. Clements, ed., Michelangelo: A Self- Portrait; Text and Sources, New York, 1968, p. 88, plate; Karl Frey, ed., Die Dichtungen des Michelagniolo Buonarroti [1897], ed. 2, Berlin, 1964, pp. 383-385, no. 100, fig.). The drawing conceivably predates their association, documented as 1536-1547. For portraits of Vittoria Colonna, with related features, and her graphic legacy in images of sacred and profane love, see the recent article by Jozef Grabski, "'Victoria Amoris': Titian's Venus of Urbino; A Commemorative Allegory of Marital Love," Artibus et Historiae, 40, 1999, pp. 9-33. 100 Dawn: Hibbard, pp. 184, 191, 193 (Dawn a maiden, Night a mother); Baldini 1981 n4, details of nos. 31, 34, esp. figs. 106, 108.

The embracing Gemini twins, Castor and Pollux, since antiqui- ty were often viewed as symbolizing a homosexual relationship (Liebert, p. 258f.); cf. also Manchester Madonna angels, Doni Tondo ephebes, the many Sistine Ceiling pairs of embracing and caryatid- like young boys, and Last Judgement male lovers in limbo (Frommel n86, pp. 96, 126 n. 238, pi. 11). 102 For the proposed paragone using Leda in competition with Titian, see Condivi, p. 70f. (Michelangelo insulted by Alfonso II d'Este's emissary, gives Leda to Mini for his sisters' dowry, taken to France, and owned by Francis I); Hirst, p. 109f. (tacit entry into com- petition with Titian); Liebert, pp. 255, 260f. (withdrawal of Leda, embarrassed by its transparent self-revelation), pp. 259-261 (a tacit competition with Leonardo); Jacobs n79, p. 62f. (the implicit contest and Aretino's promotion of Leda). Aretino's licentiousness: See his sonetti lussuriosi, published c. 1525, 1527, in Giulio Romano, Marcantonio Raimondi, and Pietro Aretino, I modi: The Sixteen Pleasures; An Erotic Album of the Italian Renaissance, ed. and tr.

The image has a dragon-like snake- lizard head, a thick and truncated swan-snake neck-thorax, feline-dog hind legs, a humped rump with swan or raptor(?) wings, and a mas- sive snake-lizard tail coiling forward over the neck toward the head and doubling as a serpentine tongue. (Students' sketches of male pro- file heads are superimposed on the body.)

In praise of fantasy, see Piero di Cosimo, the friend of Lorenzo and model for Michelangelo, who like Leonardo made pictures from 116</page><page sequence="39">EROS, EMPATHY, EXPECTATION, ASCRIPTION, AND BREASTS OF MICHELANGELO detritus and clouds, exploiting chance for a free range of imagination (Kris and Kurz nl, p. 46, citing Vasari [par. 2]). 104 See, related, Ashmolean Greyhound-Salamander in Flames (Parker n82, no. 320); British Museum Serpentine-Necked Greyhound- Salamander, with closed and open jaws (Wilde, no. 50); British Museum Female Dog-like Salamander (Fig. 28), with a pig-like tail, a humped dog's back and partly female hindquarters, heavily muscled male-like human shoulders and arms with clawed forelegs, massive human female breasts spreading on the ground, a monkey-like head with a marked underbite, goat neck wattles, and canine-goat-equine ears (Wilde, no. 54 verso); Hartt, nos. 188-190. Cf. also Michelangelo/Saslow, no. 122 (heated love-death madri- gal to Vittoria Colonna, 1536-1546, with a Petrarchan salamander in flames-an emblem used by Michelangelo's hoped-for and overtly biva- lent patron, King Francis I of France; see also Ashmolean Greyhound- Salamander in Flames, supra). The graphic genre recalls Archaic and Orientalizing Etrusco-Corinthian animal polymorphism in vase painting; see, too, the very similar Etruscan bronze Chimera of Arezzo, found 1553, ostensibly restored by Cellini, and its Etruscan lion kin (William L. Brown, The Etruscan Lion, Oxford, 1960, pls. 52-57; Cellini n81, pp. 189, 220 nn. 393f., cleaned and restored for Duke Cosimo). For kindred erogenous menacing snakes, see, e.g., the Sistine Ceiling Temptation, female double-legged "snake" encircling the Tree of Knowing (n92); Last Judgment Minos, in Hell (to phallus); Night's hip-slung poppy coil (Fig. 23); Bertoldo's self-absorbed ouroborus in Poggio a Caiano frieze generative first scene (n57); and Cleopatra (n86; to ample breast). The Cleopatra, much loved by Cavalieri, to whom Michelangelo gave it, has revealing kin. Within its outlines, on the recently uncovered verso, is a misogynous(?) diabolic complement with walleyes and goat- ish features (Casa Buonarroti, I disegni di Michelangelo, Milan, 1994, p. 36, fig.), a Mannerist trick-warning(?). Similarly grotesque and mordant- ly playful are variously zoomorphic and goatish male heads probably for decorative detail (British Museum, Wilde, no. 33 recto, and Windsor no. 12762 recto; Hartt, nos. 496, 497; Hirst, figs. 159, 160). Cleopatra herself has a comely and similarly voluptuous sister (sans snake) in Venus, Mars, and Cupid (n86; see there also the seated women). 105 Schongauer's Saint Anthony: Condivi, pp. 9f., 124 n. 121 (on panel); Giovinezza, nos. 44 (engraving), 45 (a Ghirlandaio studio copy on panel); Eisler, pp. 8, 12 n. 22 (attributions to Michelangelo). 106 For the kinetic and contrapuntal interplay and conjunction of muscular architectural masses, planes, orders, and details, see, e.g., early, middle, and late phases of Michelangelo's architecture illustrat- ed with incisive commentary in James S. Ackerman, The Architecture of Michelangelo (1961), Harmondsworth, 1971, chap. 6, figs. 35-50 (Laurentian Library); chap. 8, figs. 89-106 (St. Peter's); chap. 10, figs. 124-134 (Porta Pia, ornamentation), and 285-290 (summary). For the anthropocentrism of his architecture, derived from Renaissance mod- els ultimately based upon Classical norms of Hermogenes and Vitruvius, see also Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of the Renaissance (1949), London, 1988; David Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, Princeton, 1981, pp. 418-445. See, too, Michelangelo's paintings, drawings, and sculptures for crisp layered, laden, and boiling convexities in quasi-mimetic, campish, and ornamental furniture for the body, such as idiosyncratic head coverings, helmets, armor, buckles, sandals, jewelry, drapery, and the like-a descendant of House of Nero and predecessors' grotesquery and a harbinger of Mannerist-Baroque fantasy. It is worth recalling here that "Mannerist" was once the simplifying deprecatory term used for followers of Michelangelo's manner (or "maniera") and that, psychologically, "mannered" signifies outre behavior far beyond the norm; furthermore, that this idiosyncratic mode was subsequently consolidated into the weighty new authoritative standard-also reduc- tively and pejoratively named by successors-Baroque, Latinate for the extravagantly irregular, like the barocco pearl (Portugese). 107 Celibacy, latent homosexuality, and abstinence in Michel- angelo: Like admiring apologists after him, Condivi variously noted and described as virtues dark aspects of celibacy, sublimation, repression, and autoerotic propensity in the life, poetry, and art of Michelangelo-e.g., Condivi, passim, esp. pp. 24-27 (chastity-virginity as a source of youth and virtue for the Vatican Pieta Madonna, but not her son [Michelangelo?]; repeated in Vasari/Bull, p. 337), 102-105 (an ideal love of beauty in all things-male, female, animal, spiritual- Platonic and otherwise), 105f., 108 (abstemious nature in life, food, and intercourse; about the latter see also p. 146 n. 128, marginal note citing Michelangelo: "I have always practiced this, and if you want to prolong your life, practice it not at all, or the least you can."). Cf., too, the well-known passages in Lucretius De Rerum Natura 4.1030-1287 (outspoken distaste and cautions about sexuality), in Robert D. Brown, Lucretius on Love and Sex, Leiden, 1987. See further nn44, 81, and Liebert, pp. 302, 306f. (sexual orgasm linked to death); Hibbard, p. 233 (Michelangelo's intrinsic homosexuality). In a related vein, note that the penis of "Eros," like that of the Bacchus, is broken away, hence "castrated"; in Michelangelo's early improvisation on the Apollo Belvedere the penis is also missing (British Museum, Wilde, no. 4; Giovinezza, no. 72); none of these fig- ures has pubic hair. See also his overcompensating competitiveness and productivity as a young student before and consequent to his own broken "nose-phallus," inflicted while in Bertoldo's "Academy" by the macho rival and hotblood Torrigiano (Condivi, pp. 108, 146f. n. 129). See, too, the highly finished and voluptuous back views of the "Eros" and the buttocks of the David and Risen Christ, "shaped... with sensu- ous joy," and the shared intimacy of the Zeus Abducting Ganymede drawing (Hibbard, pp. 232, 235f., fig. 157; and, further, Howard 1997, pp. 93, 129, 140, Ganymede's autoerotic precursors, legacy, and rejection). My long-time friend and colleague the psychodramatist Dr. James M. Sacks rightly reminds me that psychological homosexuality does not presume its practice. For Michelangelo's extravagant and chaste affection for Vittoria Colonna, whom he likened to a man and god in intellect, while she thought him a devout and zealous admirer, to be enjoyed as a "unique," see Condivi, p. 103; Hibbard, pp. 254-263; Liebert, pp. 312-330 (source of resolution and longevity for Michelangelo); Saslow, in Michelangelo/Saslow, pp. 18f., 50-52 (role reversals with Colonna in poetry and psychodynamically); and, further, Michelangelo's poems, ibid., nos. 111-298, passim. 108 Duchamp cultivated polymorphisms, informed by Freud, who shared his "Leonardo complex" and identified with Leonardo's scien- tific and humanistic genius; see, e.g., Seymour Howard, "Hidden Naos: Duchamp Labyrinths," Artibus et Historiae, 29, 1994, pp. 153- 180; idem, "Duchamp, Freud, and Psychoanalysis," in Psychoanalysis and the Humanities, eds. Laurie [Schneider] Adams and Jacques Szaluta, New York, 1996, pp. 41-75. Theodore Reff also deals with par- allels, primarily visual ("Duchamp and Leonardo: L.H.O.O.Q.-alikes, Art in America, 65, 1977, pp. 83-94). 109 In addition to the contested date, pose, and identity of the "Eros," notable problems remain-e.g., the bronze-oriented composition; selec- tively inconsistent proportions, rendering, and patterns of wear; project- ing right arm uncanonically attached to the shoulder and quiver with metal dowels; unfinished face and finely polished back side; fake breaks on nose, lips, and hair; quiver strap thin on the chest, trimmed away at the shoulder, and thickened and pyrotechnically undercut on the back; unfin- 117</page><page sequence="40">SEYMOUR HOWARD ished hair, eyes, ears, and quiver; and roughly executed left- and right- hand attachments on top and bottom of the open quiver. Most of these features can be and have been viewed both as suspect and as character- istic of Michelangelo's widely vacillating early work. It is also worth noting that no case has yet been made for a conjectured alternative sculptor-inventor that approaches the cogency of one for Michelangelo. Coda 110 Cf. Freud's conclusion to his innovative study on the artist, cit- ing Leonardo's commentary on the countless causes of things in nature and beyond experience, which anticipates Shakespeare's admonition (nn85, 87). 111 On his primacy, variety, and leadership in the Beat Movement, see Wally Hedrick: Selected Works, catalogue, San Francisco Art Institute, 10 April to 11 May 1985 (preface, Walter Hopps; essay and bibliography, David Rubin); Lisa Phillips, et al., Beat Culture and the New America, 1956-65, New York, 1995; The Beat Generation Galleries and Beyond, essays by Seymour Howard, Allen Ginsberg, et al., Davis, 1996, pp. 5-11, 57-99, 195-198, 201-204. 112 The Setting Sun: Stella G.

The following ekphrastic text will appear in a forthcoming vol- ume on my ideograms: Word and Image, under "Sweeps (1989)," no. 90 (also linked to a sanguine Medusa and a sour Cassandra, nos. 76, 88): Milkstone. A canted blue square five spatulas wide with blue then green cross-stripes (make red and black?), creating a plaid checkerboard-like field over a white [breast] circle underpainting. Green, black, and white circles then ring the barren teat-like and milky center issuing a red drop of blood- milk. A lactating-weaning image referring to Lady Macbeth as a destroying-denying would-be mother and two art historical subjects: (1) Michelangelo, who said that he learned sculpture from the milk of his wet nurse, a stonemason's wife, and (2) Delacroix's Massacre at Chios, in which an infant attempts to nurse at the breast of its slaughtered mother, probably allud- ing to a legendary Hellenistic sculpture by Epigonos. 114 Socrates, Michelangelo's spiritual model and intellectual father, was popularly identified then and in antiquity as a stonecutter- sculptor and creator of the Athenian Acropolis Propylaia Three Fates (See Pollitt n43, p. 87, citing Douris of Samos, Pausanius 1.22.8 and 9.35.3ff., Pliny N.H. 36.32, and Diogenes Laertius 2.9).
