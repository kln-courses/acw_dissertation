<plain_text><page sequence="1">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations of the Kansas City Locality Brad Logan Kansas State University, Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Social Work, 204 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506-4003 (blogan@ ksu.edu) Abstract Late Prehistoric (AD 900-1500) adaptations along the lower Mis souri River in the Kansas City locality include two distinct contempo raneous archaeological cultures, Steed-Kisker and Pomona. Both are reviewed with emphasis on interaction, change, and continuity. Evi dence from other sites in northeastern Kansas, a prairie-woodland ec otone, points to interaction where their culture core areas overlapped, a locality that was a frontier throughout much of prehistory between cultures of the eastern woodlands and the Great Plains. Recent inves tigation of house remains at the Scott and Caenen sites, representing the Steed-Kisker and Pomona cultures respectively, provides signifi cant insight concerning relations or lack thereof. About 130 years apart in time of occupation, they are only 350 m distant in Stranger Creek valley, the last major tributary of the Kansas River before its confluence with the Missouri River. Both illustrate the contrasting nature of these adaptations, specifically change from a Woodland ad aptation represented by Steed-Kisker and continuity with respect to it represented by Pomona, which persisted longer. The possibility of assimilation of both cultures with the Oneota tradition during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is discussed. Throughout most of the Holocene the Kansas City locality, centered at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas Rivers along the parent stream from St. Joseph to the Fishing River and westward to include the Stranger Creek watershed, has been a boundary between different environments and cultural adaptations (Figure 1). In this area it has long been evident that adaptations of the woodlands to the east of the Missouri River influenced those of the prairie to its west. Elsewhere I have presented evidence of this aspect with regard to Archaic, Woodland, and Late Prehistoric cultures (Lo gan 1988a, 1990, 1998a, 2006a, 2006b). Thus, the locality is recognized as a frontier insofar as it defines "a line of division between different things" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frontier). Relevant here is the contrast between Late Prehistoric adaptations recognized archaeologically Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 35, No. 2 (Fall 2010), pp. 229-270.

In particular the fortuitous preservation and timely excavation of the Scott and Caenen sites, each of which had a house only 350 m distant in the same valley and about 130 years apart in time, provides new information about these cultures and their relations on this frontier (Figures 1-2). The Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the Kansas City locality entailed replacement of an ecotone of two major biomes, the spruce forest of eastern North America and the montane conifer parkland that was dominant to the west and southwest, with another consisting of oak-hickory woodland and tall grass prairie respectively (Griiger 1973). Throughout the Holocene, the latter, climatically-sensitive ecotone moved. For example, the prairie com munity expanded at the expense of woodland during times of prolonged aridity (i.e., the Altithermal) (Griiger 1973:245) and vice-versa during re gimes of increased precipitation. Lacking local climatic data for the Medieval Warm period (AD 900-1300) (Cook et al. 2004), a time of increased dry ness that corresponds to most of the Late Prehistoric cultural period, we can only hypothesize that the prairie component of the ecotone along the lower Missouri River expanded. That the central Plains as a whole experienced sig nificant climatic change during this time is evident in the mobilization of dune fields in the Sand Hills of Nebraska 800-1000 years ago (Sridhar et al.</page><page sequence="3">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 231 Caenen Figure 2.

The woodland-prairie ecotone at that time differed, but not radically so, from the pre-Euroamerican vegetation communities modeled by Kiichler (1974), who describes a mosaic of bluestem prairie and oak-hickory forest in the western portion of the locality, including most of Stranger Creek basin and the Scott and Caenen sites. People in this ecotone may also have been affected by changes in their social environment, particularly about A.D. 1300, when Siouan-speaking cultures of the Midwest recognized as the Oneota tradition expanded geo graphically and established a regional exchange center at the Leary site near the northern edge of the Kansas City locality (Figure 1). This expansion in Iowa has been described as aggressive, entailing the exploitation of Wood land populations for their labor (Benn 1989). Whether this process also brought about the disappearance of other Late Prehistoric cultures in the Kansas City locality during the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries is not clear and may be coincidental. However, sites such as Scott and Caenen may provide the basis for addressing this problem.</page><page sequence="4">232 Brad Logan Stranger Creek, a north-bank tributary of the Kansas River, enters its par ent stream 40 km from the Missouri River and drains an area of 1,380 km2. Archaeological surveys there have documented more than 170 sites of Late Pleistocene through Holocene age (Logan 1985, 2004, 2005, 2008a). A vari ety of environmental and social factors underscore the region's transitional nature and frontier relationships with regard to prehistoric adaptations of the Midwest and Great Plains. Here I focus on the nature and relationship of Steed-Kisker and Pomona, contemporary Late Prehistoric cultures that exemplify differing adaptations to a shared environment. Late Prehistory in the Kansas City Locality Post-Woodland cultures of the region have been assigned to a period de scribed as Plains Village or Village Farmer (Hoard and Banks 2006; Logan 1996). The first implicitly and the second explicitly emphasize the critical role of agriculture in subsistence economies. Habitation sites of the period are best described as farmsteads of one to three houses (Logan and Hill 2000:253; O'Brien 1978a). I have adopted use of the strictly temporal desig nation Late Prehistoric for the period A.D. 900-1500 (Logan and Ritterbush 1994) that in the central Plains includes two broad forms of adaptation, the Central Plains tradition (CPt) and the Pomona variant. Two cultures of the CPt along the lower Missouri River are Steed-Kisker and Nebraska, the former found from Missouri City about ten miles west of its confluence with the Fishing River upstream to St. Joseph, Missouri and the latter from St. Jo seph northward to the Platte River (Logan 1996; Roper 2006). It is probable that both derived from Woodland adaptations, though that from which Po mona developed was likely located in the Osage Cuestas of eastern Kansas. Thus, an overview of late Woodland in the region is necessary. Late Woodland Late Woodland cultures in the region were descendant from a Middle Wood land variant called Kansas City Hopewell (Johnson 1976, 2001; Logan 2006a, 2006b) and appear in various localities during the sixth and seventh centuries AD. Their development is attributed to demographic pressure on resources by populations that had become quite efficient at exploiting them with a com bination of hunting, gathering, and nascent agriculture based on the garden ing of native cultigens supplemented with maize (Adair 1988, 1996; Johnson 1976, 2001). Groups from extensive base camps that had successfully prac ticed this pattern eventually found it necessary to inhabit smaller, more dif</page><page sequence="5">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 233 fusely located camps. While Late Woodland people were still more sedentary than those of the earlier Holocene (Paleoindian, Archaic, and Early Woodland periods), they still maintained a seasonally determined settlement pattern to a greater extent than later Central Plains tradition populations. Other aspects of their life way can be summarized as follows. Subsis tence followed a generalized pattern that utilized wild prairie-woodland-riv erine flora and fauna marked by an increase in dependence on domesticated plants, including marshelder, sunflower, and maize. Settlements consisted of circular to oval pole-supported structures of wattle-and-daub that were occupied by an extended family. They were sometimes paired at one habita tion site and are generally located on terraces, occasionally on upland ridges. Ceramics were typically elongate jars with cord marked exteriors. Temper varies regionally and includes sand, grit, crushed limestone, and grog. When present, decoration is limited to crenulations on the lip and punctates below them. Lithic assemblages included a variety of chipped stone and ground stone tools, including drills, scrapers, axes, celts, manos and metates, and abraders. The propulsion of projectile points entailed use of both the at latl-and-dart and bow-and-arrow. Both dart and arrow points are generally corner-notched, of the Steuben and Scallorn types respectively. Mortuary practices are poorly known, but they appear to have continued the Middle Woodland practice of cremation and mound burial, as well as primary pit interment of extended or semi-flexed individuals. Steed-Kisker Long described as Mississippian and attributed by some to the migration of people from Cahokia (Calabrese 1969; O'Brien 1978a, 1978b, 1981, 1988, 1993; Shippee 1972; Wedel 1943), Steed-Kisker is now considered a phase of the CPt that differs from others (Nebraska, Smoky Hill, Solomon River, and Upper Republican) in geographic location and ceramics, specifically sur face treatment, decorative elements, and temper (Logan 1996; Roper 2006; cf. Henning 1978:165). It shares with them general house form, settlement pattern, subsistence economy, and technology (lithic, ceramic, and bone/ shell). As noted above, Steed-Kisker was probably an indigenous develop ment from a Woodland base (Logan 1990, 1996,, 2006a; Logan and Beck 1996; Logan and Ritterbush 1994; Roper 2006). Lodges were rectangular structures of wattle-and-daub construction sup ported by interior posts centered on a stone-free hearth, sometimes with an extended entryway. They range in area from 22.4 to 123.2 m2 with a mean of 46.6 m2 (Angelbeck 1999; Logan and Hill 2000; Shippee 1960, 1972) and</page><page sequence="6">234 Brad Logan often contained cylindrical and belled pits. These served as storage facilities and were sometimes also made outside the homes. Only 13 houses at ten sites have been described, and while most conform to the general pattern (e.g., Steed-Kisker, Young, Gresham, McClarnon, and Cloverdale), a few vary in architecture from the prototypical rectangular, four-post pattern. The only house at the Coons site (23PL16) had perimeter posts on two sides set in trenches, similar to lodges at Cahokia (O'Brien 1993). No other Steed-Kisker house has that attribute. Two houses, one at 23CL276 at Smith ville Reservoir and the other at Crabtree (23CL164) near Missouri City in the Missouri River valley, are square but have open corners. For the former, McHugh et al. (1982:179-182) hypothesized an astronomical function that entailed viewing celestial events through the corners from the lodge cen ter, marked by a single post. This interpretation was attributed more strenu ously, and with ethnographic analogy, by O'Brien and McHugh (1987) to a sky-based calendrical system linked to seasonally dependent, agricultur al practices. The nearly identical lodge at Crabtree was seen by Angelbeck (1999) as nothing more than variation in Steed-Kisker houses. That lodge also had a central post, and four interior ones that formed a rectangle in its southern portion. A hearth in the northeastern quadrant, varied botani cal remains, ceramic and lithic artifacts all indicate the structure's domestic function. Angelbeck (1999:64-66) cogently argues against the "astroarchae ological significance" of either open-cornered house, concluding both rep resent "variance for the Mississippian period in the west Missouri region." Ceramics were smoothed, occasionally shoulder-decorated jars, bowls, bean pots, and water bottles tempered with crushed mussel shell. Rims are low and often rolled. Handles and other appendages (tabs, nodes, zoomor phic and anthropomorphic effigies) are common. Exterior colors range from light brown, through dark brown to nearly black (Wedel 1943). Cala brese (1969) defined the diagnostic Platte Valley ware, subsequently divided by Chapman (1980) into two types, Platte Valley Plain and Steed-Kisker Incised. Decorative treatment consists of curvilinear or rectilinear incised lines, often repeated in the quadripartite, "sunburst" pattern of Mississip pian wares (O'Brien 1993). To date, only one sherd of Ramey Incised pot tery has been documented at a Steed-Kisker site (Coons), supporting contact with Cahokia (O'Brien 1993). An early attempt at temporal seriation, one not tied to absolute chronology, posits increased frequency in geometric designs and diminishing frequency of curvilinear motifs (O'Brien 1974). Other works of clay are pottery anvils and pipes. Most pipes are made of stone, some with incisions that may be evidence of tattooing and ritual ac tivity (Johnson 2000).</page><page sequence="7">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 235 Stone tools are indistinguishable from those at other CPt sites. They include notched and unnotched triangular arrow points, alternately bev eled knives, heavy duty bifaces (e.g., axes, adzes, choppers), end scrapers, drills, gravers, retouched and utilized blades, ground stone celts and axes, sandstone shaft abraders, manos, metates, and faceted hematite (pigment processing discards). Some chipped stone tools of exotic materials were acquired through trade or long-distance travel to the east (e.g„ Burlington chert from central Missouri) and west (e.g., Permian cherts from the Flint Hills of Kansas), but most are made from local or near-local stone. Subsistence was derived from hunting and gathering supplemented by farming various indigenous and non-native plants. Archaeobotanical re mains from Crabtree include maize, common bean, bottle gourd, squash, marsh elder, sunflower, little barley, goosefoot, and tobacco (Lopinot 1999). Lopinot (1999:118) sees particular significance in the absence of erect knot weed, the presence of common beans, and the "pronounced influence of Eastern Eight Row or Northern Flint germplasm in the maize population," all of which distinguish Steed-Kisker from Cahokia. He suggests that, like other cultures in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas, Steed Kisker people "were perhaps not migrants, but local people who were assim ilated into the Mississippian world" (Lopinot 1999:118). Adair (2006:258) attributes Steed-Kisker plant assemblages, like those of other CPt sites, to "multicropping residential farmers who occupied one location year-round." Animal remains are those of prairie-edge game such as deer and elk, as well as bison and woodland species such as raccoon, fox, and rabbit. Dogs were used for both transportation and food. Long distance hunting forays are inferred from Steed-Kisker sites such as Vista Shelter (23SR20) at the edge of the Ozark Highland of southwestern Missouri (Wood 1968), though the importance of this has been over-emphasized (e.g., O'Brien 1978b). We del (1943, 1978) infers a subsistence economy based on local resources in a rich environment and attributes the dearth of faunal remains to poor tapho nomic factors at the Steed-Kisker site. Calabrese (1969:153-155, 189) notes a similar paucity at the Friend and Foe (23CL113) and Butcher (23CL118) sites in the Smithville Reservoir area, northwestern Missouri. Settlement variability is not yet fully known; farmsteads are likely one of a variety of sites that also included "unifunctional" activity, or resource extractive camps (Logan and Hill 2000; McHugh, Gardner, and Donahue 1982:189-190). Steed-Kisker origins have been attributed to either migration or indig enous development, with the latter view now ascendant (Chapman 1980; O'Brien and Wood 1998). Its disappearance or transformation remains a mystery (Logan 1998a, 1998b). Given that all of the CPt coincides with a</page><page sequence="8">236 Brad Logan period of increased dryness, it is more likely that climate contributed to the success of that adaptation, not its demise. Lensink (2005:150-151) notes short-term climatic fluctuations are complex and may have had more af fect on house site occupations than major regimes. Moreover, anthropo genic changes in vegetation caused by over-clearing of woods for fuel and lodges may have contributed more to site abandonment and population movements. As an alternative to climatic stress, Blakeslee (1993) suggests soil-depletion via swidden farming brought about a northward movement of CPt groups around A.D. 1300. This model has been recently tested with regard to the Nebraska phase in the Glenwood locality, western Iowa. Using GIS-based data, Pugh (2009) finds that there could not have been sufficient pressure on arable land or other resources utilized by the CPt generalized subsistence economy to necessitate swidden agriculture as it is generally understood (Pugh 2009). Thus, cultural factors rather than environmental ones must have driven CPt abandonment of some localities from the late thirteenth to fourteenth centuries AD. The fourteenth century expansion to the central Plains of the Oneota tradition may have contributed to CPt change or movements (Logan 1995, 1998c). This problem was first raised by Henning (1970:158-159), who suggested Oneota and Steed-Kisker "flourished simultaneously" with "slight intercommunication." Benn (1989) suggests that aggressive expansion of the Oneota forced assimilation of Woodland groups in Iowa. This process might also explain the late fourteenth century disappearance of Steed-Kisker, reflecting its absorption by Oneota groups (Ritterbush 2002, 2006). If this occurred rapidly, then documenting it archaeologically may be difficult. Pomona The Pomona culture was first defined as a focus (Witty 1967) and subse quently redefined as a variant with four phases (Brown 1985). While the taxonomic integrity of these phases has been questioned (Logan and Beck 1996:64; Logan and Hedden 1993:25-26), variant is appropriate for the complex given its geographic extent. Pomona sites are found throughout much of the eastern third of Kansas. Brown (1985) suggests western Mis souri served occasionally as a resource area, an inference derived from the May Brook site (23JA43) (Schmits 1982). Ceramics, a Pomona hallmark, are globular jars and bowls with high, straight or flaring rims. Generally undecorated, they sometimes bear oblique incisions across the lip and/or incised or trailed lines around the rim. Surfac es are plain or cordmarked and temper varies, more frequently consisting of</page><page sequence="9">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 237 crushed sherd (grog) and less frequently sand or crushed shell. Significantly, shell temper appears more frequently at northeastern Kansas sites, probably reflecting influence from Steed-Kisker groups there (Brown 1985). Lithics are virtually indistinguishable from those of other Late Prehis toric cultures in the central Plains. Bone tools and faunal remains are rarely preserved, perhaps due to "climatic factors and the basically acidic soils of eastern Kansas" (Reynolds 1987:30). The most striking difference between Pomona and the CPt is the absence of rectangular lodges (Blakeslee and Rohn 1986; Witty 1978, 1981). Houses appear to have been oval structures of flexed poles covered with thatch and clay that covered an area approxi mately 36m2. Post mold patterns are often so irregular that house form and area cannot be determined. These structures generally lack interior hearths, but intramural pit features may occur (Reynolds 1987:32). It is generally accepted that Pomona developed from indigenous Late Woodland cultures (Brown 1985:429; Johnson 1991; O'Brien 1984:64; Reynolds 1987:24, 26). Witty (1978, 1981) describes Pomona as an adapta tion contemporaneous with CPt groups in eastern Kansas, and that repre sents the survival of Woodland groups who added farming to a hunting and gathering economy. While cultigens, including cucurbit, sunflowers, com mon beans, and maize have been documented at Pomona sites, they are less prevalent than at those of the Central Plains tradition (Adair 1988). Others do not view Pomona "as a Plains Woodland survival into the Middle Ce ramic period, at least not to a greater extent than is true for the Central Plains tradition" (Blakeslee and Rohn 1986:1292). Johnson (1991) sees Pomona as ancestral to the historic Kansa, an interpretation critically reviewed by others (Henning 1993; Logan and Hedden 1993; Vehik 1993). In Brown's (1985) view, the settlement pattern was a continuation of regional Plains Woodland and Late Archaic patterns, all characterized by shifts between upland, warm weather settlements and lowland, cold weath er sites. He infers seasonal abandonment of camps in their core area in fa vor of hunting forays to the mixed grass prairie to the west and the Ozark Highland to the east. Our knowledge of upland camps is hampered by a bias toward investigation of lowland sites. Relationship Radiocarbon chronology supports contemporaneity of Steed-Kisker and Po mona. Brown (1985:444) gives a range for Pomona of A.D. 960-1350 and dates its northernmost expression, the Apple Valley phase of the Delaware River valley (which shares its eastern divide with Stranger Creek basin) to</page><page sequence="10">238 Brad Logan A.D. 1300-1350. He distinguishes that phase from others of the variant on rather limited grounds, specifically the presence of knobs on the lips and rims of ceramic vessels, the presence of shell temper, and the relatively low incidence of non-local cherts for chipped stone tools (Brown 1985:447 448). Based on critical review of available radiocarbon dates from Steed Kisker sites, Logan and Ritterbush (1994; cf. Logan 1988a:7) infer a range of A.D. 950-1400 for that complex, revising O'Brien's (1993:66-67) nar rower one of A.D. 1050-1250. Support for the broader range was subse quently provided by late thirteenth and fourteenth century dates from the DB (14LV1071) and Scott sites (Logan 1998a, 2004). Contemporaneity is a necessary, though not sufficient, basis for any hy pothesis of interaction between Steed-Kisker and Pomona. More compelling is the association of diagnostic artifacts at sites in northeastern Kansas sug gested to have been their frontier, such as at Keen (14JF303) and Zacharias (14LV380) (Figure 1). Keen is on Walnut Creek, a tributary of the Delaware River. Excavated by the Kansas State Historical Society in 1965, its structural remains and predominant ceramic ware indicated Pomona occupation. A smaller sample of Platte Valley ware was associated with two lodges and a pit, including one vessel thought to have been manufactured locally (Witty 1983:38-56, 108). A thicker, cordmarked and grit tempered ware is suggested to be indicative of the Grasshopper Falls phase of the Plains (Late) Woodland period. Witty (1983:108-111) suggested the associated wares reflect: 1) disturbance of an earlier Woodland occupation by a later Pomona group, or 2) an ancestral and transitional relationship between them. Based on temporal overlap of radiocarbon dates from other sites of the complexes represented at Keen, Witty (1983:110) believes it is "more than a possibility that the Grasshopper Falls phase ware sherds do have a contemporary origin with the Pomona component as vessels rather than [as] in situ or collected sherds from an ear lier manifestation." He concludes that "the presence of Platte Valley ware... with evidence that at least one vessel was fired locally, give[s] direct evidence for intersite and cultural relationships" (Witty 1983:219). My goal at the Zacharias site was to address this problem of cultural development and relations in the Late Prehistoric frontier, that is, the area of overlap between the Central Plains tradition and Pomona variant (Lo gan 1985:322-323, 1988a, 1990; Figure 1). Zacharias is on a terrace along Salt Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River north of Leavenworth, Kansas (Figure 1). Test excavations in 1984 resulted in its placement on the Na tional Register of Historic Places and protected it from imminent highway construction. Both Steed-Kisker and Pomona ceramics were recovered, with</page><page sequence="11">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 239 the former being predominant (Thies 1984). Excavations in 1988-1989 by the Kansas Archaeological Field School, a joint program of the University of Kansas and Kansas State University, yielded a greater sample of Steed Kisker and Pomona pottery, as well as Late Woodland ware (Logan 1990, 2006a:90-91). All wares were associated in three of four areas excavated. In two areas, Late Prehistoric pottery either increased in frequency with depth or was more frequent than Woodland ware throughout all levels and none of the associations could be attributed to post-depositional disturbance (Lo gan and Ritterbush 1994:6). Rather, the evidence at Zacharias suggests the Late Prehistoric groups were in contact, perhaps during a time of transition from a Woodland form of adaptation. Because absence of evidence is not it self evidence, it is possible that some indiscernible taphonomic process may have created a palimpsest of different occupations at Zacharias. The similar ceramic associations there and at Keen, however, present a compelling rea son to pursue the problem of development and interaction elsewhere in the frontier. Three of four radiocarbon dates from Areas 2 and 4 at Zacharias are consistent with Late Prehistoric placement (Hoard and Banks 2006:296 300 [calibration was with Calib 4.4.2 and probability distributions are not given]; Logan 1990; Logan and Ritterbush 1994:10). Statistical test of these dates after recent calibration (Calib 5.0.1; Tables 1-2) demonstrates they are the same (test statistic T = 4.876, Xi2 = 5.99, p &lt; 5 percent). Calibration of their mean age (852.7 ± 26.2 BP) gives a two-sigma range of A.D. 1056-1076 and 1154-1257, with 96.3 percent of the probability distribution encom passing the latter. Calibration of the date from Area 3 (Beta-36365) is more consistent with a Late Woodland component (AD 500-1000). However, it extends into the tenth century AD, suggested to have been a time of transi tion from Woodland to Late Prehistoric adaptations in the central Plains (Hofman et al. 1996:217). By itself, the assay is insufficient for inferring a distinct Woodland occupation at Zacharias. Thus, the hypothesis of Steed Kisker and Pomona interaction during a time of transition remains plau sible. In sum, it is suggested that a Woodland adaptation in the central Plains gave rise to two distinct cultural adaptations, the Central Plains tradition and Pomona. In the Kansas City locality there is some evidence that sug gests the Pomona interacted with CPt groups. The latter recognized as the Steed-Kisker phase, exhibits influences from Mississippian cultures to the east, though, this is primarily in attributes of their ceramic technology. Po mona groups maintained a Woodland form of adaptation in several regards and ceramic technology changes were limited mostly to form, from elongate</page><page sequence="12">240 Brad Logan Table 1.

Like many sites of the Central Plains tradition, it appears to have been a farm stead occupied by one extended family. Surface survey and test excavations</page><page sequence="14">242 Brad Logan beyond the house yielded a sparse, diffuse amount of cultural material and no discernible activity areas or features (Logan 2004). We are fortunate the lodge remains survived, given their location 20 m east of the cut bank of Stranger Creek and 50 m west of a man-made levee, borrow for which ap pears to have come from its western side within 30 m of the house (Figure 2). Indeed, preservation and exposure of the lodge reflect the variable pro cesses of Stranger Creek. Since establishment in 1929 of a USGS recording station on Stranger Creek 2.46 km south (downstream) of Scott, records indicate the stream floods frequently, inundating extensive portions of its valley as often as three times a year (Logan 1985: Appendix 1). Landown ers in the watershed inform me that flooding over the past 60-70 years has increased because of diversions from road and bridge construction. Road grades across the valley created causeways that impede efficient drainage of flood waters. The valley's attraction for prehistoric settlement is evident at three sites near the confluence of Stranger and Little Stranger Creeks, including Scott and Caenen. Cultural horizons from .3-1.3 m below surface at the Evans site (14LV1079) 250 m south of Scott date to Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Middle Woodland, and Late Prehistoric times (Logan 2004, 2005) (Figure 2). Scott has a buried component of Middle Archaic age. It includes an ex tensive stratum of burned soil with a few artifacts exposed on the cut bank of Stranger Creek 160 m north of the Scott site house and at a depth of 3.0-3.8 m. Charcoal from the feature has been radiocarbon dated to 5270 + 70 B.P. (ISGS-5460; Logan 2004:57). Obviously, people were not averse to valley settlement in this area at various times through the Holocene. While the valley is subject to gentle over-bank flows that bury sites such as Scott, some severe floods scour the terrain. During one such flood in June 2001, then the most severe on record, the stream surged over its banks with such force that it stripped the plowzone from an area of flood plain that had been previously subject to pedestrian survey, in vain, for archaeological sites (Logan 1981, 1983). Fortuitously, the area was walked a few days later by Scott Demaranville, an artifact collector and previous site informant, who found a concentration of cultural material and immediately contacted me. Excavation of the Scott site was done by many volunteers who helped salvage an obviously significant site threatened by future flooding and plow ing. Field work in July and October 2001 and May 2002 revealed remains of a square (7.5 x 7.5 m, 56 m2) lodge of wattle-and-daub construction cen tered on a basin hearth, with a series of internal posts, a few perimeter posts, southwardly extended entryway, and two cache pits (Figure 3). The hearth (85 x 75 cm) was a stone-free basin with a 12 cm thick lens</page><page sequence="15">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 243 Figure 3. Scott site house floor plan with features: Fl-hearth, F2-belled cache pit, F12 cylindrical cache pit; others are post molds. of very compart oxidized soil (Figure 4). Thirty pieces of fire cracked quartzite (total mass = 3.2 kg) were scattered about the floor (&lt; 5 pieces per m2). It is apparent that the occupants kept the internal-post hearth area clear of debris as only two of these stones lay within it, one just barely so. The largest stone (777 g) was within a me ter of the fireplace, perhaps for hearth-related use. The larger of the two cache features may have been a dou ble pit (Figure 5). Eighty-five cm in diameter at its orifice, its base was 1.2 m below the house floor. The feature fill contained a layer of reddish brown, oxidized soil with Figure 4. Scott site house feature 1, hearth. Note burned timbers to lower left of feature.</page><page sequence="16">244 Brad Logan Figure 5. Scott site house features 2 (left) and 12, cache pits. Note metate in F12. charcoal and burned earth that suggested the pit was open to a depth of 45 cm when the house burned. All but two of 68 piece-plotted artifacts were below this layer, in the lower 46 cm of the feature. A pocket of ash 28 cm wide and 15 cm thick, attesting cleaning of the hearth, was noted in the cross section about 36 cm above the pit base. The smaller cache was cylindrical, 77 cm in diameter, and extended 40-45 cm below the floor (Figure 5). Though it yielded only ten artifacts of plottable size, one was a metate, the largest artifact in the house. Seventeen post molds were discerned, including four internal roof sup ports placed with near symmetry around the central hearth. A fifth post set midway between the southern pair may have supported a fire screen that protected the hearth from drafts (cf. Wilson 1934:386). Alternatively, it may have held a mortar or a post that braced a sagging cross-beam, as these are inferences offered for post molds in similar positions in House 1 at Steed Kisker (Wedel 1943:69). The charred remnant of an in situ post, perhaps from a gear-post or prop, was found near the northwestern roof support. Pe rimeter posts were few; none were found along the western side of the floor. However, the edge of the floor was apparent throughout where loose house fill met compact, well-structured subsoil. A few post molds marked the 1.2 m wide threshold of the 4 m long, ramped entryway. Vertical control of the Scott house fill is provided by piece-plotted arti facts (Table 3). These range in depth with regard to the mapping point (4 m north of the block) from +5 to -35 cm with a mean of-13.35 ± 8.2 cm. Pottery sherds, 78 percent of these items, have a comparable mean depth (-12.9 cm) but a smaller standard deviation (5.5 cm), indicating most cul tural material lay within a relatively thin horizon. The vertical depths of 39 burned timbers (-.5 to -29.5 cm) is comparable to the range of all piece plots as is their mean depth (-14.55 cm). Since these probably fell on the floor after collapse of the structure (some came to rest upon artifacts), their</page><page sequence="17">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 245 Table 3.

Thirteen burned timbers are identified as slippery elm (Ulmus rubra, n=ll), pecan (probably hickory, Carya cf. illinoisensis, n=l), and sycamore (Platynus occidentalis, n=l) (Logan 2002:22-23, 2004:48, 2008b; Regis Mill er, personal communications to author, March 28, 2002, February 8, August 3, and December 1, 2003, and May 31, 2007). Most were found in the west ern half of the house where several larger portions were oriented parallel to the main axes of the lodge. These likely mirror their position as supporting beams, suggesting they fell without much distortion. A sample of an un identified burned timber, another of slippery elm from the larger cache pit, and a third of burned hazel nut shells from just north of the hearth were radiocarbon dated (the first two standard, the last AMS; Tables 1-2). These returned a calibrated average (two sigma range) of A.D. 1243-1296 (see Logan 2004:50 for discussion of statistical tests and averaging). Cultural material was abundant and varied (Tables 4-5). Ceramics, the most frequently encountered artifacts, consist of 6,497 sherds (93 percent shell tempered) with a total mass of 14.94 kg. Restorable vessels were few; more complete pieces were found in the lower portion of the larger cache pit where they escaped trampling and scuffage. A trail of sherds throughout the entryway and areas of greater debitage density at and around the threshold reflect these disturbance processes. Trabert (2009) estimates they represent a minimum number of 55 vessels. They include a variety of jars and bowls, most of which are examples of Platte Valley Plain (Figures 6-7). Only a doz en decorated rims can be identified as Steed-Kisker Incised (Figure 6). Three rims have attributes indicative of Nebraska phase pottery, including McVey</page><page sequence="18">246 Brad Logan VJWml Figure 6.

These were shell tempered (Trabert 2009). No Pomona pottery was found. Sixty-six formal chipped stone tools include notched arrow points (Fig ure 9) and preforms (n = 41), beveled knives and other cutting tools (n = 10; Figure 10), a drill, graver, and end scrapers (n = 13; Figure 11). Unique in the assemblage are a Nodena-like point with a "waist" and a corner-notched projectile point/knife (Figure 10). The first of these is made of Mississip pian chert from central Missouri. The source material of the projectile point/ knife cannot be identified because it was burned, probably at the time of the house fire. It is similar typologically to several others found by Dema ranville at the adjacent Evans site and may have been recovered from the Middle Woodland component there by the house occupants, who recycled it as a knife. Informal tools, including retouched/utilized blades, were also made of local and Mississippian cherts. Most chipped stone tools are made of Toronto and Plattsmouth cherts from Pennsylvanian outcrops within the watershed (Logan 1988b).</page><page sequence="20">248 Brad Logan k k A Figure 9.

Scott site house end scrapers. Heavy duty tools such as axes, hoes, and choppers are absent from the house. The only large tool is an adze of imprecise provenience recovered from the site surface by Demaranville. While such tools were produced, used and, perhaps, maintained outside the lodge, we would expect them to be stored within it. Thus, their absence is difficult to explain. While the house may have been abandoned and large tools taken elsewhere, this inference does not apply to the usable metate cached in the smaller pit. The scarcity of primary and secondary debitage, relative abundance of tertiary flakes and chips, and presence of broken points, knives, and scrapers indicates primary, intramural lithic activity entailed finishing, maintaining, and refitting smaller chert tools. Spatial analysis of debitage revealed density peaks of this material at the perimeter of the four-post hearth area (Logan 2008b, 2009). These peaks reflect places where lithic activities occurred or, more likely, loci where debris accumulated through toss and displacement. The debitage mainly consists of very small debris overlooked or ignored dur ing cleaning, demonstrating the McKellar Principle (DeBoer 1983; McKellar 1983; Stevenson 1991). The house floor and fill contained a variety of ground stone artifacts (Table 4). Cobbles and slab fragments of Sioux quartzite had been collected</page><page sequence="22">250 Brad Logan Table 4.

Sandstone was readily available across Stranger Creek where the Tonganoxie member is dramatically exposed and known locally as the "Cliffs." The largest example of the latter material is the complete metate found near the base of the smaller pit (Figure 5). Examination of soil ad hering to the metate revealed two maize cob phytoliths and a "culturally elevated frequency (33.3 percent) of Corylus" (Bozarth 2007:6), the latter consistent with numerous charred hazel nut shells from water screen and flotation samples of the house fill. Sandstone was also used for shaft abraders (Figure 12). Other tools of metamorphic stone include grinding slabs, hammer stones, and nutting stones. Dense pieces of ferrous oxide (hematite) that differ from the softer material found in till deposits were likely acquired through trade or forays to</page><page sequence="23">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 251 Figure 12.

Of 16 pieces found at Scott, half are from the house; others of less precise provenience were collected by Demaran ville. All are faceted or striated from abrasion to obtain pigment (Figure 13). Other than charred timbers, macroscopic plant remains were rare. Only a single maize kernel, from a unit at the end of the entryway, has been iden tified thus far. As noted above, charred hazel nutshells were more abundant. Other plant remains have not yet been identified as the assemblage requires more ethnobotanical analysis. Animal bone and shell were equally rare (334.9 g and 34.6 g respectively). The paucity of unburned bone may have been due to poor preservation, but it is more likely that animal remains were periodically cleaned from the house. Even burned bones are few. Deer elements are more numerous than those of other animals but only relatively so. Whether we can infer that deer contributed more to subsistence is speculative. Two antler fragments, perhaps flint knapping tools, were re</page><page sequence="24">252 Brad Logan Figure 13.

Other deer elements include a few maxillary and mandibular tooth row segments, a glenoid, vertebrae, and a metapodial splinter. Most were found in the larger pit and likely preserved because of their rapid burial there. Two metapodial fragments with groove-and-snap treatment (Figure 14) indicative of tool (awl?) production were found to the left of the doorway near the dorsal spine of a bison thoracic vertebra. This last item, the only bison bone found, may have been a tool such as a pottery paddle. Another deer metapodial piece was found in the smaller storage pit. The larger pit also contained a poorly preserved bone awl (deer?), part of a turtle carapace, a few fish scales, and a small amount of mussel shell. Organic material was more prevalent in the western half of the house, perhaps reflecting a preference for trash disposal there (Logan 2008b). We del (1943) suggested poor preservation of organics, as well as the leaching of shell temper from pottery, at the Steed-Kisker site might be due to soil acidity. In this regard, it is interesting that shell temper was found in only six potsherds at Scott, all from the lower portion of the larger pit (Trabert 2009), whereas all others had the "holes" characteristic of Platte Valley ware (Calabrese 1969; Chapman 1980; Wedel 1943:74). To test whether this cor relates with soil acidity, pH was measured in soil samples collected in 2.54 cm (1 in) plastic cubes hammered at 5 cm intervals into the cross-section of the larger pit feature from orifice to base (William Johnson, personal com munication, January 18, 2008; the samples were originally taken to measure magnetic susceptibility and frequency dependence of susceptibility). Con verse to expectations, the values indicate not only weakly acidic soil but that</page><page sequence="25">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 253 Figure 14.

This suggests organic preservation was due to factors other than just pH, though soil acidity may have varied across the house floor. Given evidence of house-cleaning provided by other debris, it is likely that most animal bone, other than a few tools, was removed. Caenen The Caenen site is 350 m north-northwest of the Scott house and like it was exposed by flood scouring (Figure 2). An erosional wash that drains over flow during floods from a tight meander of Little Stranger Creek to Stranger Creek has impacted the site on the north. Prior to the flood of 2001, Dema ranville had collected an end scraper, two points, and two biface fragments from the wash. During survey in 2003, dozens of flakes of Toronto chert were found in the wash, but more cultural debris, including sherds of Pomo na pottery, chipped stone tools, debitage, and daub, were found in the field south of it. These probably had been exposed by the same flood that un covered the Scott house, and subsequent tilling. Like Scott, Caenen is multi component. Evidence of a Late Archaic occupation was exposed on the side of the wash at a depth of 1.1-1.3 m. Material recovered there includes a few flakes, burned limestone, and a large piece of charcoal. A sample of the latter returned a calibrated, two sigma range radiocarbon date of 1393-1055 B.C.

Caenen (left) and Scott house excavations showing relative density of piece plotted artifacts. Note trail of debris through the extended entryway and concentration of material in F2 at Scott (cf. Figure 3). Survey and excavation of three test pits indicated most of the surface component occurred within an area of approximately one ha to a depth of about 30 cm, or just beneath the plow zone, and that nearly all daub was within an area of about 100 m2 (Logan 2004). A 32 m2 block encompass ing two of the test pits was excavated by the Kansas Archaeological Field School (Logan 2005). Evidence of house occupation at Caenen was typical of Pomona sites and in stark contrast to that found at Scott. As the area of the block indicates, house remains were less extensive. No hearth, pits, or post molds were found and artifacts were markedly less abundant (Figure 15). The correlated spatial distribution of daub, pottery, and chipped stone debris attests to the occupation of a wattle-and-daub structure that covered 24 m2 (4 x 6 m), about 43 percent of the area of the Scott site house (Lo gan 2005). Though the Caenen site house was smaller than that at Scott, it yielded nearly twice as much daub (69.31 kg vs. 36.23 kg) (Figure 16). Piece plotted artifacts totaled 204, just 17.6 percent of the number plotted at Scott, excluding those in features. They range in depth from the mapping point (4 m south of the block) from +.5 to -24 cm with a mean of -10.1 ±5.1 cm, indicating a shallow, circa 10 cm thick cultural horizon.</page><page sequence="27">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 255 Figure 16. Distribution of daub by mass (gm) at Caenen (left) and Scott showing relative density and configuration. The Caenen site house assemblage is both less varied and more im poverished than that from Scott (Tables 4-5). Of 204 plotted finds, 168 are sherds and the remainder are chipped stone tools (n=3), flakes (n=9), ferrous oxide (n=20), large daub (n=3), and a sample of charcoal. The dif ference in artifact density most likely reflects relative duration of occupation. In contrast to Scott, Caenen held a modest amount of pottery representing two jars and a "coconut" bowl of Pomona ware (Figure 17). No sherds of Steed-Kisker or Nebraska ware were found. Formal chipped stone tools were limited to 11 arrow points, some from block units beyond the house proper (Figure 18). No knives, drills, gravers, or scrapers were found in the block, though some were found in the site area. Debitage was considerably less abundant than at Scott, amounting to only 16 percent by count and 32 per cent by mass of that at the nearby Steed-Kisker phase lodge. The difference in count/mass ratio of chipped stone debris between houses reflects longer occupation of Scott combined with clean-up at the latter that overlooked or ignored a greater number of very small flakes. The only ground stone artifact from the Caenen block is a sandstone shaft abrader from the northernmost test unit where it was discarded at the</page><page sequence="28">256 Brad Logan Figure 17.

Other lithic material includes pieces of soft ferrous oxide, probably from local sources. Most of this (94 percent by mass) was concentrated in an area of less than 2 m2 in the southwestern corner of the house, an area of pigment production or discard. No hearthstones such as burned limestone or fire-cracked quartzite were found, not surprising given the absence of a fireplace. Despite systematic flotation, organic material consisted of just 27 min</page><page sequence="29">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 257 Figure 18. Arrow points from the Caenen site house block excavation. ute fragments of burned bone, none identifiable taxonomically, and 33 g of charcoal. All samples were too small for conventional radiometric dating. Thus, one of a few burned nutshells from a unit near the center of the house was submitted for AMS assay (Tables 1-2). Calibration supports a place ment of A.D. 1434-1501 (Logan 2005:46). The absence of post molds, storage pits and a hearth suggests a surface built structure erected for relatively short occupation. The few broken ceram ic vessels, paucity of chipped stone and ground stone tools and debris, and paltry amount of burned plant and animal remains attest a brief, perhaps seasonal, stay. Discussion The Caenen and Scott sites exemplify the distinctive traits of the Pomona variant and Steed-Kisker phase. Their proximity in a region where other sites suggest interaction raises the problem of frontier relations. With regard to architecture, the Caenen and Scott houses had little in common other than at both, clay plaster had been applied to a grass-covered structure. The Scott house floor was easily recognized by the contrast in color and structure</page><page sequence="30">258 Brad Logan between its fill and the soil beyond. The lodge was square with rounded corners, covered an area of about 56 m2, and had a strong internal support ing framework of four or five posts centered on a hearth. In all respects, it was characteristic of a Central Plains tradition lodge and with the excep tion of two pits is remarkably similar in form and orientation to House 1 at the Steed-Kisker site (Wedel 1943:68). Pomona houses, when definable, are oval, of small area, and without internal hearths (Brown 1985:407-411; Reynolds 1987). While the shape and area of the house at Caenen can only be inferred from the distribution of daub, it fits that description. The daub extent appears to mark a house floor longer north-south than east-west, that is, more oval than square and about 24 m2 in area (Figure 16). Given an estimated area of 5 m2 per person (Lensink 2005:142; Wedel 1979), the Caenen site house could have been occupied by five persons, that at Scott by as many as eleven. The framework of the Caenen lodge may have been flexible poles of small diameter that were shallowly set into the ground at the periphery then bent and lashed over the floor without internal support. Reynolds (1987) describes his reconstruction of such a structure based on information from Grasshopper Falls phase (Late Woodland) sites in north eastern Kansas. Since Pomona represents the Late Prehistoric survival of such a culture, his model is appropriate for the Caenen structure. Because the Caenen house builders did not dig a shallow pit for their lodge, part of its floor lay within reach of later tilling and it suffered ac cordingly. Because those at the Scott site dug such a pit, they contributed to preservation of the lodge's sub-floor features, including post molds, cache pits, a central hearth, and several burned beams. Though poor feature pres ervation at Caenen cannot be attributed entirely to the surface-built nature of its house, it was likely a factor, particularly with regard to post molds. The Scott site house had an easily discerned central hearth of highly oxidized, compact earth. The house at Caenen had no apparent fireplace, though the lack of a hearth is not unusual for Pomona lodges. According to Brown (1985:411), "hearths rarely occur within habitation structures, suggesting either the structures were not occupied during the winter, or their thatch construction prohibited the use of interior hearths because of fire hazards." The Scott site house had two storage features, both with ceramic, lithic, fau nal, and charred plant debris. The Caenen site house had none, though in tramural and extramural pits are found at some Pomona sites. Thus, more extensive exploration in the area beyond the house might detect outside pits (remote sensing, including relative conductivity, proton magnetometry, and ground penetrating radar, of a 13 x 10 m area that included the block did not reveal any features; Logan 2005:38-40).</page><page sequence="31">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations The lodge at Scott contained a richer and more varied assemblage, in cluding sherds from many ceramic vessels and more lithic tools. Whereas the house at Caenen had no plant processing implements, the Scott site house had a metate, manos, and fragments of other grinding tools. No formal cut ting or scraping tools were associated with the Caenen site house, but knives and end scrapers were found at Scott. Small, faceted pieces of a dense hematite that has been described as a trade commodity from Missouri sources (O'Brien 1993) were collected at Scott. Less modified pieces of locally available, softer ferrous oxide were found at Caenen. Despite poor preservation and house cleaning, more burned bone fragments and plant remains, particularly nut shells and charcoal, were recovered from the Scott house fill than at Caenen. In sum, contrasts between the two house sites could not be more ap parent. They suggest that the duration of occupations and, to a significant extent, the nature of intramural activities differed. There is no evidence of contact between those who lived in them. Because plant remains were scarce at Caenen, it was necessary to rely solely on AMS radiocarbon dating. As abundant samples of burned wood and annual plant seeds were available at Scott, both standard and AMS dating resulted in more precise temporal placement. Three calibrated and averaged assays from Scott date A.D. 1243 1296. AMS dating of Caenen to circa A.D. 1433-1495 indicates that it post dates Scott, probably by several generations. It is particularly significant that the date from the Caenen site falls beyond the two sigma ranges of all assays from Scott (Tables 1-2). Though the Caenen date is close to the youngest of those from Scott, it is statistically different (test statistic T = 6.88, Xi2 = 3.84), indicating the houses were not contemporaneous. Because temporal placement of Caenen is based on a single radiocar bon assay, it could be suggested that its late date is inaccurate. However, another late Pomona site in northeastern Kansas provides support for sur vival of this culture to the fifteenth century. Shadow Glen in Cedar Creek valley, Johnson County is contemporary with Caenen (Logan and Hedden 1990, 1993). There is no statistical difference between the two dates from Shadow Glen and that from Caenen (pooled mean age= 425.9 ± 21.5; test statistic T = .93, Xi2 = 5.99) and the two-sigma calibrated range of all three (AD 1434-1484) falls well within the fifteenth century (Tables 1-2). Thus, both were occupied after the inferred end of the Steed-Kisker phase around A.D. 1400 (Logan 1998a:310-311; Logan and Ritterbush 1994:3-4). Unlike Caenen, the house at Shadow Glen was not featureless (Logan and Hedden 1993). The half-dozen post molds discerned are consistent with a lashed, pole-framework structure like that reconstructed by Reynolds (1987) and a concentration of ash from a hearth was found near them. Like Caenen, the</page><page sequence="32">260 Brad Logan artifact assemblage from Shadow Glen was not rich. It includes 226 piece plotted items, most of which are pottery (n=118) and the balance chipped stone tools, debitage, hearth stones, and other debris. Dry-screened (.64 cm [0.25 in] mesh) fill from the 35 m2 block, comparable in area to that at Cae nen, yielded 4,317 artifacts (excluding a small sample of historic material). The contrast between Scott and Caenen underscores that between the archaeological cultures they represent. While the origin of the Central Plains tradition in general, and the Steed-Kisker phase in particular, is not clear, there is reason to suggest that it developed from regional Woodland adap tations (Logan 2006a; Roper 2006). A stronger case for such derivation is possible for Pomona because of more evident continuity in house form, subsistence-settlement patterns, and ceramic technology. If valid, indig enous development of both indicates the alternative means of adaptation possible in the central Plains during the Medieval Warm period. Pomona groups maintained a more mobile life, one that entailed short er-term occupation of camps, whereas CPt groups established farmsteads with more substantial homes that were occupied for longer periods of time, possibly throughout the year. If permanent, their use did not preclude short term use of camps elsewhere, some in upland settings (Logan 1998a), or long-distance hunting forays (Wood 1968). Pomona developed in south eastern Kansas and then expanded to northeastern Kansas by the mid-thir teenth century, coming into more frequent contact with CPt groups. This would explain the appearance of shell temper in Pomona vessels in areas closer to Steed-Kisker groups after about A.D. 1250 (Brown 1985:151, 176 178, 428-429). Brown's (1985:442) suggestion that "the Kansas Till Plains of northeastern Kansas appears to have been the last region inhabited by Pomona populations" is based on calibration of dates that did not include those from Shadow Glen and Caenen. While his trend surface analysis of radiocarbon dates from Pomona sites does not support a northward move ment, it was limited by sample size (29 dates) and source (19 sites, most re stricted to small areas, specifically reservoirs) (Brown 1985:113-120). Dates from sites such as Caenen and Shadow Glen will provide a more reliable basis for future analysis. At present, calibrated dates from both support the hypothesis of a late Pomona movement to northeastern Kansas. It remains problematic whether Pomona and Steed-Kisker popula tions were in contact in northeastern Kansas, though association of their ceramic wares at some sites makes it plausible (Logan 1988a, 1990). Roper (2006:128) suggests this "does not mean that two separate and distinct cul tures coexisted in the region-only that some members of the population did and some did not adopt the new agricultural and technological system" that</page><page sequence="33">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 261 characterized the Central Plains tradition. If Pomona and Steed-Kisker rep resent one population, why did some members practice different systems in the same environment, indeed at Scott-Caenen, almost the same spot? The difference in time of occupation at Scott and Caenen supports the argument that Steed-Kisker and Pomona may not have co-existed, but what are we to make of sites like Keen and Zacharias (Logan 1988a, 1990; Witty 1983) that suggest they did and may have interacted? If the people we recognize as Steed-Kisker and Pomona had environmental factors in common, then it suggests social factors were critical to their distinction. If the evidence of interaction is valid, it also indicates that in northeastern Kansas, Pomona families maintained a way of life in the presence of others who had adopted a different system, and continued to practice it after the others had left. How do we explain the persistence of the more conservative form of adaptation? Were Steed-Kisker groups more ready participants in other dy namic changes occurring in the fourteenth century and Pomona more re sistant? This time correlates with social changes on the edge of the eastern Great Plains that include expansion of the Oneota tradition and the north ward movement or geographic contraction of some CPt groups. Changes among the latter were not "monolithic," but characterized by variability in subsistence-settlement practices at different times in different places and this pertains as well to times of contraction (Roper 2006:129). Sometime dur ing the fourteenth century CPt populations abandoned the lower Missouri River region, perhaps moving upstream to merge with St. Helena or Initial Coalescent (Roper 2006:130). Assimilation with Oneota at a major regional exchange center such as Leary, in the southeastern corner of Nebraska, may also have occurred then (Henning 1998). This is plausible given radiocar bon dating of Leary to A.D. 1250-1450 and evidence of CPt presence or influence in one house there (Hill andWedel 1936). Ritterbush (2006:157 158) suggests that after Leary had been occupied initially by CPt and subse quently by Oneota groups, that at least a portion of the site was settled by "an unidentified group of people, possibly Oneota cohabiting with Central Plains tradition or Steed-Kisker peoples, Oneota peoples influenced by na tive populations, or a Central Plains tradition or Steed-Kisker household." Obviously, Leary is a good place to look for more evidence of the interaction or assimilation of Oneota and Steed-Kisker (Ritterbush 2002). Pomona groups in northeastern Kansas clung to a way of life that had not changed dramatically from Woodland time into the fifteenth century, after which no evidence of them or any other Woodland-derived complex is found. It is possible they too were absorbed by Oneota, given tenuous evi dence of occupation at Leary from A.D. 1450-1650 (Ritterbush 2006:155).</page><page sequence="34">Brad Logan If so, there is no archaeological evidence of it. By about A.D. 1500, Oneota groups recognized as Dheigha Siouan moved to the western edge of the Prai rie Peninsula, beginning with exploratory forays but eventually establishing extensive villages (Henning 1998:243). By the seventeenth century, this pro cess brought the Kansa to the lower Missouri River valley in the Kansas City locality where at different times they established major villages at Fanning, King Hill, and Doniphan, none of which has yielded evidence of Steed Kisker or Pomona occupation. Conclusions Sites such as Caenen and Shadow Glen point to longer continuity of Po mona. The contrasts with Steed-Kisker in house form, hearth placement, ce ramic ware, assemblage variability, and duration of site occupation suggest interaction between these groups did not result in significant acculturation. Beyond an increase in use of shell temper in their pottery, Pomona people appear to have adopted little from the Central Plains tradition. They main tained a rather conservative adaptation, one like that of their Woodland ancestors that was more mobile, involving construction and shorter term occupation of less substantial homes. Caenen provides additional support for the interpretation of Shadow Glen: Not only did the Pomona folk in northeastern Kansas survive all other [Late Prehistoric] cultures in the Kansas City locality, so (from an archeological perspective) did their cultural heritage. Gone is any trace of influence from Central Plains tradition or Mississippian populations with respect to ceramic technology... and house form as well. This has important implications for understanding frontier be havior based on archeological data. It suggests an indigenous group in the Central Plains was open to contact and information exchange with different populations.. .yet maintained its cultural integrity. It points to a significant degree of cultural conservatism. The people we recognize as Pomona persisted into the fifteenth century, perhaps a few generations past the Central Plains tradition in the same area and the time of Oneota expansion to the central Plains. They maintained most of their cultural (ethnic?) identity insofar as it is manifested in the archaeological record. [Logan and Hedden 1993:27] The lack of evidence pointing to interaction at sites such as Scott and Caenen raises the possibility that the relationship inferred from sites like</page><page sequence="35">Frontier Life: Late Prehistoric Adaptations 263 Keen and Zacharias is inaccurate. A scenario for Steed-Kisker and Pomona in northeastern Kansas is that the latter entered the area from their core in southeastern Kansas after the former had disappeared, perhaps through as similation with Oneota groups northward along the Missouri River. In this case, association of ceramic wares diagnostic of both cultures at any one site might be attributed to Pomona disturbance of Steed-Kisker habitations. After all, Scott and Caenen demonstrate families of both liked the same ter rain for lodge occupation. Had the Caenen family made their home closer to, or upon, the Scott site, it could have resulted in the mixture of ceramics seen at Keen and Zacharias, and that we might see as evidence of interac tion. By refining the radiocarbon chronology of sites like them and rigor ously documenting their contextual evidence, particularly where different archaeological cultures are represented, we may understand the dynamics that led to change and continuity in the lower Missouri River valley during the fourteenth century AD. Acknowledgments. Much of the research about the Scott and Caenen sites has been supported by Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) grants, National Park Service awarded by the Kansas Historical Society to Kansas State Uni versity. The Scott house was excavated by many volunteers, most of whom were with the University of Kansas (KU), Kansas State University (KSU), Kansas Historical Society, Kansas Anthropological Association, Kansas City District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Archaeological Association of South Central Kansas. Test excavations there and at Caenen, as well as block excavation of the latter, were done in 2003-2004 by participants of the Kansas Archaeological Field School, an educational research program of Kansas State University. Thanks to the landowners, John and David Ev ans, and the farmer, Henry Caenen, for permission to dig. Thanks to Mary Adair, Archaeological Research Center (ARC), University of Kansas, for ar ranging the loan of Scott house materials to KSU. Data analyses were aided by students at KU and KSU, with partial support from HPF grants to KSU. Through these efforts the Scott and Caenen sites were placed on the Nation al Register of Historic Places in 2004 and 2005 respectively. My thanks also to the late Fred Leimkuhler, who opened many doors for me in Stranger Creek basin after I began research there in 1979. I am particularly grateful to Scott DeMaranville, who found both sites, informed me about them while I was at the KU Museum of Anthropology (now ARC), and donated his collection from Scott to that institution. Finally, I am indebted to the MCJA reviewers, whose comments enhanced the quality of this paper.</page><page sequence="36">264 Brad Logan References Adair, M.
