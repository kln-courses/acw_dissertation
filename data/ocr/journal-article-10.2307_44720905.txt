Institut d'Anatomie de l' UFR Biomédicale des Saints-Peres ABSTRACT The anatomical dimensions, inertial properties, and me- chanical responses of cadaver leg, foot, and ankle specimens were evaluated relative to those of human volunteers and cur- rent anthropometric test devices. Dummy designs tested in- cluded the Hybrid III, Hybrid III with soft joint stops, ALEX I, and the GM/FTSS lower limbs. Static and dynamic tests of the leg, foot, and ankle were conducted at the laboratories of the Renault Biomedical Research Department and the Uni- versity of Virginia. The inertial and geometric properties of the dummy lower limbs were measured and compared with cadaver properties and published volunteer values. Compres- sion tests of the leg were performed using static and dynamic loading to determine compliance of the foot and ankle. Quasi-static rotational properties for dorsiflexion and inver- sion/eversion motion were obtained for the dummy, cadaver, and volunteer joints of the hindfoot. Dynamic and impact tests were conducted with dummy and cadaver limbs to de- termine dynamic moment-angle response curves for the hindfoot joints. The testing indicates that passive and active musculature of the leg strongly influences response of the leg, foot, and ankle and suggests that future dummy designs should incorporate these effects. Synthesis of the volunteer and cadaver test results provides physical properties and re- sponse corridors of the foot, leg, and ankle for use in mathe- matical and mechanical models. INTRODUCTION Improvements in the belt and airbag restraint system have resulted in significant reductions in the incidence of fatalities [1] and thoracic and head trauma [2] for frontal crashes. Consequently, lower extremity injuries have emerged as the most frequent non-minor injury resulting from frontal colli- sions [3]. In particular, trauma to the foot and ankle region constitute 30% of non-minor lower extremity injuries and nearly 10% of all non-minor injuries. The frequency, sever- ity, and disabling nature of these injuries has resulted in ex- panded research efforts to define human injury tolerance and impact response of the lower limbs. This paper summarizes recent findings from cadaver, dummy, and volunteer lower extremity research conducted at the Renault Biomedical Re- search Department and the University of Virginia (UVA) Automobile Safety Laboratory. The results presented in this paper are intended to provide information for the development of accurate injury criteria, improved mathematical models, and biofidelic anthropomor- phic test devices. To improve current experimental and mathematical models of the human lower extremity, detailed information on the geometiy, weight distribution, material properties, response parameters, and injury thresholds of hu- man lower limbs are required. This paper provides recom- mended design parameters along with an evaluation of the ability of current dummy lower extremities to model behavior and predict injury of human lower limbs. 1853</page><page sequence="2">PHYSICAL PARAMETERS HUMAN - The lower extremity is composed of six mor- phologically distinct regions: the hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and foot. This paper concentrates on the leg, foot, and ankle complex which consists of 28 irregularly shaped bones, more than 70 articulating surfaces, 30 synovial joints, over 100 ligaments, and 30 muscle attachments (Figure 1). The leg contains the tibia (medial) and fibula (lateral) bones that are attached at marginally movable joints both inferiorly and su- periorly. In addition to the bony structures, the leg contains three primaiy muscle groups: anterior (extensor) muscles, lateral (peroneal) muscles, and posterior (flexor) muscles. The posterior muscles of the calf are the largest and strongest muscles of the leg and play a large role in determining mo- tion and response of the foot, leg, and ankle. The motion of the foot and ankle complex is largely de- termined by the operation of the talocrural (i.e., the classical ankle) joint, the talocalcaneal (also called subtalar or lesser ankle) joint, the talocalcaneonavicular joint and the trans- verse tarsal joint. The talocrural joint is formed by the distal tibia and fibula and the superior aspect of the talus. The talo- calcaneal joint is formed by three facets on the inferior aspect of the talus and their complementary facets on the superior aspect of the calcaneus. For the purposes of this paper, the talocrural and talocalcaneal joints are collectively referred to as the joints of the hindfoot. The three-dimensional motion of the hindfoot joints (Figure 2) is clinically described as occurring within the three anatomical planes. Flexion occurs in the sagittal (X-Z) plane where dorsiflexion moves the superior (i.e., dorsal) surface of the foot toward the axis of the leg and plantarflexion moves the inferior (i.e., plantar) surface of the foot toward the leg axis. Inversion and eversión (referred to generically as xver- sion) occurs in the coronal (Y-Z) plane where inversion moves the plantar surface toward the median plane (i.e., the sagittal plane that divides the body into symmetrical halves) and eversión moves the plantar surface away from the median plane. Rotation of the foot occurs in the transverse (X-Y) plane where internal rotation moves the toes toward the me- dian plane and external rotation moves the toes away from the median plane. During motion of the hindfoot, the joints of the ankle/foot complex work together rather than acting in isolation. While the hindfoot joints are often described as hinge joints, the true axis for this motion is not contained within any anatomic plane and changes orientation over the complete range of motion. In particular, flexion of the hind- foot joints is coupled to both rotation and xversion of the foot. Figure 2. Anatomical motions and coordinate axes of hindfoot joints. 1854</page><page sequence="3">HYBRID III - The foot and ankle assembly of the Hybrid III uses a ball joint to approximate motion of the human ankle and subtalar joints (Figure 3). In the original design, the range of motion for the Hybrid III was 30° of dorsiflexion, 50° of plantarflexion, and approximately 23° of inversion and eversión. Based on available biomechanical data [4] [5], the range of motion in flexion was adjusted to provide 45° of dorsiflexion and 35° of plantarflexion. Although providing a greater range of motion, the design still presented problems interpreting moments and forces measured in the tibia when metal to metal contact occurred at the ankle joint during ex- treme rotation. To alleviate this problem, a recent improve- ment to the Hybrid III dummy ankle has been the attachment of a circumferential soft joint stop at the ankle to prevent metal to metal contact. Results in this paper that refer to the Hybrid III dummy are for the standard ankle with 45° of dorsiflexion while those referring to the Hybrid III soft joint are for the 45° of dorsiflexion ankle with the soft joint stop. ALEX I - The Advanced Lower Extremity prototype (ALEX I) is the result of advanced dummy research efforts by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The ALEX I incorporates several design changes intended to improve the biofidelity of the dummy lower limbs and to offer additional sensing capability for injury predic- tion. An orthogonal universal joint is used at the ankle with ±45° for dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and ±30° for inversion/ eversión (Figure 4). Urethane joint stops are used to produce rotational resistance and to prevent metal to metal contact at Figure 3. The Hybrid III lower extremity. Figure 4. Mechanical drawing of the ALEX I lower extremity. 1855</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5. Design of the GM/FTSS foot and ankle assembly for the Hybnd III dummy. inversion/eversion axes. Internal and external rotation are provided by an uninstrumented pin joint located superior to the universal joint. The metallic foot of the Hybrid III has been replaced by a prosthetic sole plate composed of a carbon fiber composite material. A mount for three orthogonal uniaxial accelerometers is located in the heel structure. The tibia incorporates an anterior force sensor array to measure contact force and location in addition to the standard upper and lower load cells. In order to approximate more closely the inertial properties of the human lower limb, the density of the ALEX I dummy leg flesh is greater than that of the Hybrid III and composite structures are used to represent the bones of the lower extremities. Design changes are currently under- way for the fabrication of an improved lower extremity (ALEX II ) that incorporates cadaver and volunteer data pub- lished since the design of the ALEX I. GM/FTSS ADVANCED FOOT AND ANKLE - The foot and ankle components of the General Motors Corp. (GM)/First Technology Safety Systems (FTSS) lower extrem- ity assembly have been modified to attach to the distal end of the standard Hybrid III tibia (Figure 5). The ankle and foot structure of the GM/FTSS lower limb has been designed to more faithfully represent the human anatomical structure. The GM/FTSS design uses a ball joint to represent the hu- man subtalar joint and a hinge joint to simulate the human ankle. Joint stops of the hindfoot are compliant and continu- ous while providing rotations in excess of 60° plantarflexion, 45° of dorsiflexion, 30° of eversión, and 35° of inversion. A joint at the mid-foot is intended to reproduce human motion of the arch, midtarsal, and metatarsal joints. No instrumen- tation is currently incorporated into the foot or ankle assem- blies. GEOMETRY - A review of current dummy designs re- vealed considerable variability in the dimensions for the foot and ankle region. To provide a consistent set of data for the 50th percentile male, detailed measurements of the foot and ankle (Figure 6) were obtained for cadavers and compared with volunteer data from a anthropometry study conducted by Parham et al. for the United States Army [6] and from a compilation of anthropometric studies by Diffrient et al. pre- sented in Human Scale [7]. Volunteer and cadaver measure- ments of the foot and ankle were recorded in the barefoot condition. Volunteer measurements were recorded with the feet subjected to normal standing load while cadaver dimen- sions were taken in an unloaded condition. Sliding calipers were used to record external distances and radiographs were used for internal measurements. Due to variability among test subjects, most human cadaver and volunteer data pre- sented in this paper are represented as the mean value ± one standard deviation (SD). Measurements collected by UVA used 39 male cadavers (average mass of 77.5 ± 18.3 kg, average stature of 175 ± 7.6 cm) while those obtained by Renault were based on 1 1 male- cadavers (average stature of 175 ± 12 cm). While the studies by Parham et al. (n=293) and Diffrient et al. included much larger sample sizes, they did not include sufficient measure- ments to model the complete foot and ankle region. The av- erage anthropometric values for the male soldiers measured by Parham et al. (average stature of 175.6 ± 7.13 cm, average mass of 75.7 ± 11.4 kg) and male volunteers measured by Diffrient et al. (average stature of 174.8 cm) are presented with the UVA and Renault cadaver data in Table 1. CENTER OF ROTATION - The center of rotation for the cadaver hindfoot joints during flexion and xversion was de- termined from quasi-static rotational tests. Seven limbs were tested in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and 16 limbs were tested in inversion/eversion. The test apparatus and procedures were those developed by Parenteau et al. [8]. The lower extremi- ties were amputated at the mid-diaphysis of the tibia/fibula. A shaft was attached to the calcaneus while the tibia/fibula complex was potted in bone cement and attached to a frame allowing motion in the sagittal and coronal planes [9]. The experimental fixture monitored the linear and rotational dis- placements of the tibia/fibula complex as a torque was applied to the calcaneus through the shaft. The hindfoot joint center of rotation was calculated in a two-dimensional plane from measurements made by recording the displacement of the calcaneus relative to the tibia. Although the axis of rotation changed throughout ankle rotation, the center of rotation was defined as the centroid of the two-dimensional instantaneous 1856</page><page sequence="5">Table 1.

The center of rotation in dorsiflexion was located at a distance of 76 ± 8 mm from thesole of the foot and 61 ± 6 mm from the posterior face of the heel. The center of rotation in inversion/eversion was 71 ± 12 mm from the sole of the foot and 3 ± 12 mm from the axis of the leg (Figure 7). A difference in the position of the hindfoot center of rotation was identified between the human, Hybrid-Ill, ALEX I and GM/FTSS lower extremities. For both inversion/eversion and dorsiflexion, the center of rotation for the Hybrid III ankle was located at the center of the ball joint at a height of 82.6 mm. Similarly, the inversion/eversion and dorsiflexion centers of rotation for the ALEX I ankle coincided with the location of the universal joint (height of 85.9 mm). The combined ankle and subtalar joints of the GM/FTSS, however, resulted in a lower xversion axis than flexion axis. The inver- sion/eversion center of rotation coincided with the simulated subtalar joint (height of 39.0 mm). The height of the GM/FTSS flexion center of rotation was calculated as 58.0 mm and verified that flexion motion is provided by both the subtalar and ankle joints. CENTER OF PRESSURE - Contact pressure distributions at the plantar surface of the foot were obtained for dummies and six male human volunteers (average stature of 179.0±8.4 cm) using pressure sensitive film (Fuji Corporation "Super Low" Film). These monochromatic films recorded local contact pressure as color density. The recorded image was optically scanned and again converted into pressure data. The resultant contact loads were calculated as the pressure-weighted sum of the pixels. Each volunteer was instructed to stand and press firmly on a sheet of pressure sensitive film to produce a pressure profile. The outline of their bare foot and the locations of centers of the malleoli were marked on this profile. For the dummies, the leg was detached at the knee and bolted to a universal testing machine which was used to simulate the standing load. Similar to the volunteer tests, a trace of the plantar surface of the foot and the location of the ankle joint was marked on the film. The clinical definition of the ankle axis (i.e., the line connecting the distal tips of the mal- leoli) was used to determine foot contact loca- tions relative to the ankle joint. The intersection of this line with the X-axis of the foot (Figure 8) was used for the center of pressure calculations. The relevant measures were the distance from the ankle axis midpoint to the heel center of pressure (CH), and the distance from the ankle axis midpoint to the ball of the foot center of pressure (BC). These distances were measured along the line dividing the second and third toes (i.e., the X-axis of the foot).

Contact point measurements on the plantar surface of the foot. Plantar force distribution in the living human is different than that of the cadavers and dum- mies due to the role of active leg musculature in maintaining stance and posture. A review of the literature detailing foot loads when standing in the anatomical position shows forefoot loading of 39% [10], 46% [11], and 61% [12] of the total load. Load cells were placed beneath the heel and ball of Hybrid III foot while a 10 kN quasi-static load was applied to the tibia. The dummy lower extremity was disarticulated at the knee and the knee was attached to the load cell of a universal test machine (Figure 9). The distribution of forefoot and hindfoot loading was evaluated us- ing the measured reaction loads. The hindfoot of the Hybrid III dummy supported 95% ± 3% 1858</page><page sequence="7">of the load applied to the tibia. Comparable tests with the GM/FTSS foot showed that the hindfoot supported 58% ± 4% of the load ap- plied to the tibia. MASS AND MOMENTS OF INERTIA - Mass data for humans was obtained from a summary of cadaver segment mass data [13] and from data collected by Renault using 19 cadav- ers (18 male, 1 female). All studies included mostly, but not exclusively, male cadavers. In general, the leg was defined as the segment be- tween the knee and ankle joints with the foot/ankle including everything distal to the an- kle joint. For this paper, comparable segments were developed for the dummy lower extremi- ties. The leg segment included the leg skin, tibia, ankle housing, and knee clevis but not the actual knee structure (Table 2). The foot seg- ment included the foot and those segments of the ankle joints that rotated with the foot (Table 3). All dummy values are for instru- mented segments with the associated electrical cables independently supported. Mass and inertial properties of the dummy feet, legs, and ankles were measured at both Renault and UVA. Inertial properties of dummy lower extremities were determined using a three wire torsional pendulum (UVA) and a guided oscillating plate mounted on ball bearings (Renault). Principle moments of inertia were calculated relative to the segment center of gravity. The segment definitions were identical to those used in the human mass comparison with all values defined for the right lower ex- tremity. Coordinate axes were defined such that the x-axis was positive in the anterior direction, the z-axis was positive in the superior direction and passed through the ankle and knee joints, Table 2.

The refer- ence coordinate system used the ankle center as the origin. The Hybrid III origin was the center of the ankle ball joint while the ALEX I used the mid-point of the universal joint. The GM/FTSS reference was the center of the superior hinge joint. Inertial data for the human cadaver was gathered from the 19 cadavers tested by Renault and from McConville et al. [14], Data from the cadavers tested at Renault is indicated with a ® following the value. The orientation of the principal axes of inertia are given with respect to the anatomical refer- ence frame as Eider angles: yaw about the Z-axis, pitch about the Y-axis, and roll about the X-axis. Limitations on the ac- curacy of the three-wire pendulum may have contributed to higher than anticipated Euler angles for the Hybrid III foot roll angle. RESPONSE DATA STATIC RESPONSE IN AXIAL LOADING - The quasi- static axial stiffness of the foot complex was examined using four male cadaver limbs and was compared with published volunteer data [15]. Hirsch and White compressed the leg, foot, and ankle of seated volunteers while measuring the de- flection of the medial and lateral malleoli with the foot in a neutral position. A calculation based on Hirsch's data of the hindfoot joint - heel pad system suggests a stiffness of 468 N/mm. For comparison, the static axial stiffness of four ca- daver leg specimens disarticulated at the knee joint was measured. Detailed information on preparation of the limbs is provided by Kennett [16]. The legs were potted at the tibial plateau in epoxy, maintaining the proximal tibia-fibula joint and crural interosseus membrane. The proximal leg was at- tached to the load cell of a universal test machine (Tinius Ol- sen, LoCap 30,000). The height of the medial malleolus and lateral malleolus were recorded at loading increments of 500 Ν at a cross-head displacement rate of 25 mm/min. The axial stiffness of the hindfoot from the ankle joint to the heel, de- fined as the slope of the linear portion of the force/displacement curve, was calculated to be 480 ± 164 N/mm (Figure 9). A comparison between the cadaver and volunteer results suggests that there is no difference between the compressive foot and ankle stiffness of the living human and the cadaver specimens. The dummy lower limbs were disarticulated at the knee and bolted to the load cell of the universal test machine. The ALEX I tests were conducted with the ALEX I leg, foot, and ankle assembly while the Hybrid III and GM/FTSS feet were attached to the standard Hybrid III leg. Dummy axial load tests were conducted with a 500 Ν preload used to stabilize the limb and were terminated at a maximum load of 10,000 N. Stiffness of the hindfoot joints was obtained from direct measurement of the ankle joint displacement relative to the plantar surface of the foot. Force-displacement curves for the dummy hindfoot are shown in Figure 9. For the GM/FTSS component, the mating surface for the ankle attachment to the tibial shaft was straight rather than angled as in the Hybrid III (approximately 8°). This caused initial plantarflexion of the foot which resulted in compression of the anterior rubber stop of the distal ball joint with progressive loading and eventual failure of the joint stop. The human volunteer and cadaver tests depicted in Figure 9 maintained the foot in the neutral position (0° flexion, 0° xversion, and 0° rotation). It is important to realize that the sharing of loads by internal structures (e.g., tibia, fibula, and Achilles tendon) and, therefore, the effective stiffness of the hindfoot are dependent on the orientation of the foot. When the foot is dorsiflexed, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of the leg provide progressive resistance through the Achilles tendon. This resistance not only influences the mo- ment-angle properties of the hindfoot joints but can also alter the load carrying paths for the leg and hindfoot in response to Figure 9. Hindfoot stiffness in a static axial loading 1860</page><page sequence="9">external forces (Fextemai). Figure 10 shows an exter- nal load applied to the plantar surface of the foot. It is evident that the Achilles tendon force (Facmh«) acts to increase the loading observed in the distal tibia (F tibia) and fibula (Fßbuia). Figure 10. Load paths in human lower limbs. The relative load sharing between the tibia and fibula can vary depending on the orientation of the foot. Quasi-static tests were performed at UVA with three legs amputated at the knee (Table 4). Al- though the feet were initially placed in the neutral position, their motion was not restricted during ap- plication of the axial load. The applied load was re- corded at the knee while the contribution of the tibia was determined from a load cell (Robert A. Denton, Model 2886) implanted at the mid-diaphysis [3], The results suggest that the fibula statically supports ap- proximately 7% to 12% of the total applied load with the foot in the neutral position (Tests 2 and 3). Pro- gressive eversión of Limb 1 resulted in more than 17% of the total applied load being borne by the fib- ula. DYNAMIC RESPONSE IN AXIAL LOADING - Two types of dynamic tests have been performed to quantify the dynamic stiffness of the tibia/ankle complex (Figure 1 1). Tests at Renault have applied loads to the heel along the axis of the tibia at a rate of 3 m/s. Axial loading in the cadaver tibiae was recorded using an implantable tibial load cell [17] while displacements of the heel were determined through double integration of the accelerations of the impactor and the tibia. Analogous procedures and instrumentation were used for the dummy tests. Dynamic testing of lower extremities at UVA was performed by applying loads to the plantar aspect of a foot via an impact pendulum (Figure 12). The pen- dulum had an effective mass of 15 kg with a contact velocity of 6.5 m/s. Lower limbs were amputated at the mid-shaft of the femur in order to include all leg musculature that could potentially influence the properties of the hindfoot joints. Details regarding the procedures and test apparatus are given in Klopp et al. [18], Above-knee specimens were preloaded with a spring to 300 Ν tibial compression prior to impact in order to simulate occupant bracing. Accelerations of the tibia and footplate were used to calculate the compression of the distal tibia, ankle joint, and heel flesh during the first 15 ms of impact. Results were verified using analysis of high speed film (1000 fps) with phototargets placed at the distal leg and on the heel. Subtraction of the footplate displacements from the tibia displacements yielded - values for the distal tibia and hindfoot. Table 4.

The dummy components showed even greater rate dependency and were much stiffer dynamically than the cadavers. DORSIFLEXION - Quasi-static dorsiflexion tests were conducted at UVA using ten cadaver lower limbs amputated at the mid-diaphysis of the femur. Amputation at the mid-diaphysis of the femur ensured that all the musculature and joints influenc- ing the response of the hindfoot joints were main- tained. Specifically, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles that provide plantarflexion and resist dorsi- flexion were kept intact. During flexion testing, knee flexion was maintained at either 0° or 90° to include the role of the gastrocnemius muscle on dorsiflexion response of the hindfoot joints. The test apparatus consisted of a gimbal assem- bly, with two links centered about the hindfoot's theoretical center of rotation (Figure 13). A sprocket, driven by a hydraulic piston at a constant rate, produced a moment in the outermost gimbal link (fork), that was aligned with the axis of dorsi- flexion/plantarflexion (Y axis). The universal joint connecting the sprocket to the outermost gimbal link allowed the assembly to translate in the sagittal (X- Z) plane in order to compensate for motion of the hindfoot's instantaneous center of rotation and to ac- commodate initial misalignment of the hindfoot center of rotation. Translation in the medial/lateral (X-axis) direction was provided by roller bearings in the inner gimbal link. In all, six degrees of freedom, three rotational and three translational, were permit- ted in the hindfoot's motion. The gimbal assembly can be likened to a gyroscope having the hindfoot joints at its center. A moment is transmitted through the outermost link of the gyroscope, while the inner link is free to rotate about the remaining two or- thogonal axes. The cadaver tibia was mounted rigidly to the fixed frame, and the foot was mounted to the foot plate attached to the inner gimbal link. The foot was forced to rotate about the Y axis (axis of dorsi- flexon), while having freedom to rotate and translate in the remaining five degrees of freedom. The refer- ence neutral position for the cadaver tests and subse- quent volunteer tests was defined using the anterior surface of the tibia and the plantar surface of the foot. The hindfoot joints were preconditioned by completing 5 cycles of dorsiflexion and plantarflex- ion, at a constant rate of 5 deg/s. During precondi- tioning, the direction of rotation was reversed when the applied moment reached approximately ± 6 N*m. Following preconditioning, the hindfoot joints were rotated about the flexion axis at a constant rate of 5 deg/s until failure occurred. Joint failure was defined as an audible failure or a ten percent reduc- tion in the torque. Following completion of the cadaver tests, dummy dorsiflexion tests were conducted with the dummy components (i.e., GM/FTSS, ALEX I, Hybrid III, and Hybrid III with soft joint stops) until 100 N-m of moment at the hindfoot was achieved. The dummy legs were bolted to the test frame while the feet were rigidly attached to the foot plate. The dummy refer- ences for defining dorsiflexion angle were the axis of the leg, defined as the axis between the knee center of rotation and the hindfoot center of rotation, and the plantar surface of the foot. Tests of eight male volunteers (average age of 26.5 ± 8.33 years, average stature of 178± 7.02 cm, average mass of 71.4 ± 7.27 kg) were conducted using the experimental apparatus. The experiments were intended to evaluate the flexion response of volunteers in the relaxed, rather than tensed- condition, and were terminated at the first sign of discomfort. The legs of the volunteers were attached to the test frame using nylon straps at the proximal, middle, and distal leg. The volunteer feet were placed in a modified athletic shoe with a metal sole and high-top leather upper. Following attachment of the shoe to the foot plate, straps were tightened about Figure 12.

Test apparatus for determining rotational properties of hindfoot joints. the heel to prevent the hindfoot from sliding out of the heel cup. Similar to the cadaver tests, the flexion response of the volunteers was evaluated with the knee flexed 0° and 90°. The average dorsiflexion re- sponse and associated standard deviation curves for the volunteers are located in the Appendix (Figures A-2 and A-4). For comparison with the UVA tests, a series of cadaver dorsiflexion tests were conducted at Renault. The experimental apparatus for these tests was the same as that previously described for the center of rotation testing. Each leg was amputated 15 cm above the malleoli and the proximal ends of the tibia and the fibula were fixed into bone cement. A mus- cle tension of 900 Ν was simulated by applying a constant tensile force in the Achilles tendon. This created a preload in the hindfoot joints at a con- trolled force in the anatomical direction of the Achilles tendon. With the leg permitted to translate in the sagittal plane, a pure torque was applied to the calcaneus. A detailed description of the test proce- dures is given in Petit et al. [9], A comparison of the dorsiflexion tests for dum- mies, volunteers, and cadavers is presented in Figure 14. It is evident that the contribution of active and passive leg musculature determines the response of the human hindfoot joints. It should be noted that the no load position for the hindfoot joints, as defined by zero moment, does not occur at zero degrees of dorsiflexion. Rather, the no load condition occurs between 15° and 35° of plantarflexion. The influence of the calf muscles can be estimated by comparing the bent and straight leg responses for the volunteers and cadavers. With the lower extremity straightened at the knee, the gastrocnemius muscle, which at- taches to the Achilles tendon and the distal femur, is held taut and resists any dorsiflexion of the ankle. When the knee is bent, slack is developed in the gastrocnemius and the muscle does not contribute significant resistance until the hindfoot joints are considerably dorsiflexed. The current Hybrid III ankle, ALEX I ankle, and the Hybrid III ankle with the soft joint stop ap- plied virtually no resistance to dorsiflexion motion until the joint stop was reached. The human volun- teer and cadaver hindfoot joints exhibited continuous loading throughout the range of dorsiflexion. Al- though initially more compliant than the cadaver and volunteer joints, the GM/FTSS design showed continuous resistance and a similar, but offset, rota- tional stiffness at higher moments. INVERSION/EVERSION - Hindfoot rotation tests in inversion and eversión were conducted with 21 freshly amputated human legs (Figures 15 and 1863</page><page sequence="12">Figure 14. Quasi-static average moment-angle responses in dorsiflexion. 16). Similar to the dorsiflexion tests, quasi-static tests were conducted by Renault using the test ap- paratus developed by Parenteau et al. [19], Each leg was amputated 15 cm above the malleoli and the proximal ends of the tibia and the fíbula were fixed into bone cement. Preloading of the hindfoot joints was simulated by applying a constant tensile force of 400 Ν in the Achilles tendon. The calcaneus was then forced to rotate in the coronal plane. In addition to the cadaver tests, the Hybrid III and GM/FTSS components were tested in inversion/eversion. Using the six degree of freedom UVA test appara- tus previously described for the dorsiflexion tests, six male volunteers (average age 24.6 ± 7.47 years, av- erage stature 178± 7.02 cm, average mass 71.4 ± 7.27 kg) were tested in inversion/eversion. All pro- cedures were identical to those developed for the flexion tests except the moment load was applied to the x-axis of the footplate. Volunteer tests were terminated at the first sign of discomfort. The aver- age inversion and eversión volunteer curves are shown in Figures 15 and 16 respectively. Standard deviation corridors for the xversion curves are pro- vided in Figures A-l and A-3 of the Appendix. In addition to the volunteer tests, the ALEX I and Hy- brid III components were tested until 100 N-m of applied inversion/eversion moment. Figure 15. Quasi-static average moment-angle responses in inversion. 1864</page><page sequence="13">Figure 16. Quasi-static average moment-angle responses in eversión. Unlike the dorsiflexion results, the inversion re- sponse for the cadavers showed greater rotational stiffness than for the volunteers. This may be at- tributed to the fact that the cadaver tibia and fibula spacing was rigidly held by bone cement and may have limited xversion motion. The volunteer tests also permitted rotation about three axes while the cadaver tests were limited to rotation about the xversion axis. To investigate whether foot motion within the shoe could contribute to greater inversion compliance for the human volunteers, preliminary tests were conducting comparing the shoe technique with potting the foot distal to the subtalar joint in a plaster cast. Tests with the shoe and with the plaster cast were compared for three volunteers and showed statistically insignificant differences based on one standard deviation corridors about the average re- sponses. Meanwhile, the eversión cadaver and vol- unteer curves showed good agreement. The comparison of the xversion curves between dummy and human responses shows similar results relative to the dorsiflexion analysis. The dummies with non-continuous joint stops (i.e., Hybrid III and ALEX I) did not reproduce the moment-angle pro- files of the cadavers and volunteers. The GM/FTSS assembly reproduces both the inversion and eversión response with reasonable accuracy up to rotations of 30°. DYNAMIC DORSIFLEXION RESPONSE - A dynamic force was applied to the ball of the foot to study extreme dorsiflexion of the hindfoot joints. A total of 10 lower extremities were mounted with an in-situ, 6-axis tibial load cell, leaving all surround- ing musculature intact. Details on the load cell and the associated mounting procedures can be found in Portier et al. [17]. The metatarsal heads of the foot were placed on a guided brake pedal and the pedal was accelerated from rest toward the occupant using a spring and a damper (Figure 17). In all tests, the cadavers were placed in a recumbent position with their lower extremities flexed at the knees. Triaxial accelerometers were mounted on the tibia proximal and distal to the load cell. Phototargets were attached to the femur, tibia, and calcaneus and the dynamic event was filmed at 1000 fps from side and plan views. Peak pedal velocities were 5.0 m/s and peak pedal accelerations were 40 g's. In four tests, the foot was supported underneath the heel by a plate that measured reaction forces (Fx and F2) and moments (My). Forces and moments at the ankle joint were de- rived from measurements at the tibia with the im- planted load cell. Inertial compensation of the recorded forces was performed using the linear and angular accelerations. The mass and the moments of inertia for the foot and distal part of the tibia were 1865</page><page sequence="14">Figure 17.

A typical free-body diagram for the leg, foot, and ankle is shown in Figure 18. Figure 18.

The re- sults show a fairly linear relationship between hind- foot dorsiflexion and moment in the ankle. A comparison of the dynamic cadaver results with the static results (Figure 14) indicates twice the rota- tional stiffness for the dynamic (average stiffness of approximately 3 N*m/° ) relative to the static(average stiffness of approximately 1.5 N*m/° ) tests. The contribution of the Achilles tendon, acting on a moment arm of approximately 50 mm from the ankle center, was evaluated by using the forces at the ankle cross-section. The maximum calculated force in the Achilles tendon ranged from 0.96 kN to 1.9 kN for these tests (Figure 20). As indicated in Fig- ure 18, the force in the Achilles tendon can exceed 70% of the force recorded in the tibia. The point of initial tension in the Achilles was influenced by the test method whereby the tibia load cell was balanced (zeroed) with the foot in position prior to application of the load. Therefore, any tension developed be- tween the 0 N*m foot position and the 0° dorsiflex- ion position was not recorded. An evaluation of the static volunteer and cadaver tests, however, suggests that this would result in minimal offset for the ca- daver tests with knees flexed. The GM/FTSS hindfoot exhibits three ranges of response: from 0° to 35°, from 35° to 45°, and above 45°. In the first range, the GM/FTSS joints show good correlation with the cadaver static dorsi- flexion tests with rotational stiffness values of 1.0 N*m/° to 1.5 N*m/°. A sharp increase in the rota- tional stiffness to greater than 10 N*m/° is observed after 30° of dorsiflexion and may indicate a transi- tion to joint resistance from both the ankle and subtalar joints. A drop in the moment after 35° of dorsiflexion my be associated with rebound of the forefoot off the pedal. Overall, the GM/FTSS com- ponent exhibits more biofidelic behavior than the Hybrid III with the soft joint stop (Figure 21). The maximum angle of the Hybrid III test was higher than anticipated due to a failure of the metal ring that holds the soft joint stop. This failure was at- tributed to excessive clearance for the ring. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This paper presents detailed information on the geometry, mass properties, and biomechanical re- sponse of the human leg, foot, and ankle. Compari- son of this data with that obtained from testing of current dummy components illustrates that recent efforts to design more biofidelic test devices (i.e., ALEX I, GM/FTSS, and Hybrid III with soft joint stop) show improvements relative to the standard Hybrid III. The data, however, suggest that addi- tional modifications and improvements are required to ensure biofidelic response and accurate injury prediction. Furthermore, the GM/FTSS foot and Hybrid III with soft joint stop failed during the com- ponent testing and may require further evaluation for durability. Geometrical limitations of the dummy designs include the center of rotation location for the hind- foot joints and the distance from the heel contact lo- cation to the hindfoot joints. Both of these factors can be critical in determining stability and response of the hindfoot. Pressure film showed geometric factors that the ankle center to heel measurements for the dummies were greater than one standard de- viation away from those obtained in the volunteer tests. Meanwhile, the center of rotation data for the human showed general agreement with that obtained by Parenteau [19] and suggests that the flexion cen- ter of rotation is slightly higher than the center of rotation for xversion. The Hybrid III and ALEX I possessed coincident axes for flexion and xversion that were located more proximal than the compara- ble human center of rotation. The GM/FTSS hind- foot exhibited distinct xversion and flexion centers of rotation but at locations more distal than those measured for the human. The center of mass measurements showed good agreement between the dummy and human legs and feet. The mass of the Hybrid III and GM/FTSS dummy components were similar to those of the hu- man while the ALEX I foot was significantly lighter. Moment of inertia data for the foot and leg were consistently greater for the dummy components than for the equivalent human components. It should be noted that the dummy values presented in this paper are for one particular lower extremity. No testing has been performed to evaluate manufacturing variation of the dummies with regard to inertial properties. The cadaver and volunteer data demonstrate the importance of active and passive musculature in de- termining axial and rotational response of the foot, ankle, and leg. The human data illustrate the de- pendence of the dorsiflexion response on flexion of the knee and provides upper and lower bounds to be used by those developing dummy and mathematical models. The knee flexion tests also demonstrate that the zero torque condition for the hindfoot joints oc- curs with 15° to 25° of plantarflexion rather than at the neutral position. This reinforces the notion that tests of the foot and ankle use above-knee amputa- tions to ensure that all pertinent musculature is maintained. The tests specifically emphasize the role of the gastrocnemius muscle, which originates from the distal femur and connects to the heel via the Achilles tendon. This muscle was shown to influ- ence both the moment-angle joint characteristics as well as the loading in the tibia and fibula during dorsiflexion. 1867</page><page sequence="16">MS468_R (Fracture) í' * MS468 L (Fracture) JN A * 60 -- /1 .

The GM/FTSS design exhibited qualitatively the correct behavior but did not begin generating joint resistance at the same angles as the human volun- teers and cadavers. While the moment-angle prop- erties of the hindfoot joints can be reproduced with appropriate joint stops in the dummies, a system of dummy muscular resistance comparable to that of the human is required to reproduce both the mo- ment-angle and axial force influences. Ideally, the system would also incorporate the response depend- ence on the knee flexion. Xversion testing showed good correlation between the GM/FTSS and cadaver properties. Those dum- mies without continuous joint stops, however, did not reproduce the human behavior and show little improvement relative to the original Hybrid III de- sign. In static compression tests of the foot, the volun- teer and cadaver exhibited comparable foot compli- ances. The stiffness values of the Hybrid III and ALEX I were not contained within the one standard deviation corridors about the average human re- sponse. Although statically the GM/FTSS foot ap- peared too compliant, dynamic testing revealed that the design was comparable to the human component. The Hybrid III foot was stiffer than either the human or GM/FTSS foot during dynamic testing. Unlike the highly nonlinear response of the dummy ankles observed in the moment-angle testing, the force- displacement profiles of the dummies exhibited similar qualitative behavior to those of the cadaver. This suggests that axial loads measured in the dummy could be used to predict human injury if ap- propriate scaling techniques are employed. In addition to providing biofldelic response data, dummies must possess sufficient instrumentation to record the relevant engineering parameters. Current injury criteria for the hindfoot joints show better cor- relation with the angle of rotation (9, 18, 20) than with the applied moments. While all dummy lower limbs are capable of measuring forces and moments in the tibia, only the ALEX I design provided the ca- pability to measure foot Y and X rotations via rota- tional potentiometers. The ALEX I also offered mounting hardware for measuring acceleration of the foot which has also been suggested as a potential measure of foot and ankle injury (21). The GM/FTSS and Hybrid III designs should incorporate equivalent instrumentation if they are to be used for injury prediction. The purpose of an anthropomorphic test device is to represent adequately the dynamic response of a human in a crash environment. Given that a correla- tion between cadaver injury measures and related trauma can be established, it then remains a design problem to ensure that the dummy reproduces and measures comparable dynamic responses in similar conditions. While recent advancements in dummy design exhibit improvements over the Hybrid III de- sign, the findings in this paper provide data for fur- ther advances in dummy biofldelic response and dummy foot and ankle instrumentation for accurate injury prediction.
