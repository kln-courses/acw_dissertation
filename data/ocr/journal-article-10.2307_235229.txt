KARL-HEINZ LEVEN * Eighteenth Century Londa Schiebinger. Nature's Body: Gender in the Making of Modern Science. x + 289 pp., illus., bibl., index. Boston: Beacon Press, 1993. $25. Since this important book came out, in 1993, commentary has centered particularly on issues of content. Londa Schiebinger has already made substantial contributions to contemporary under- Sapientia (wisdom personified) suckling two philosophers (reprinted in Schiebinger, Nature's Body, from a fifteenth-century German manuscript). standing of the history of women and science, and in Nature's Body she broadens the scope of her investigations from "women" to "gender." In this collection of essays on eighteenth-century natural history, she deftly demonstrates how the analytic category of gender can open new doors and windows on the history of science as culture. Signaling by her title a concentration on the anthropomorphic, Schiebinger tracks how a pen- chant for reading the world not just through hu- man eyes but metonymically, as if nature were human, has produced scientific documents and policies that focus "natural" facts and events through a gendered lens. An already much-re- printed chapter concerns Linnaeus's coinage of "Mammalia" as one of his six zoological classes, replacing the canonical Aristotelian "Quadrupe- dia." Schiebinger contextualizes the Linnaean taxonomic choice in terms of eighteenth-century domestic ideology and a new cult of mother- hood. Changing cultural perceptions of female breasts were much a part of the story of science at that time, and Linnaeus the taxonomist was also Linnaeus the physician who issued an attack on wet-nursing in 1752. His scientific ideas, Schiebinger argues, should not be separated from his beliefs about male/female difference and a woman's "natural" responsibilities as a mother. Assumptions about sexual difference also per- meated eighteenth-century racial science. Schie- binger explores the centrality of facial hair, for example, in theories about hierarchies of racial types; thus, priority given to a male secondary sexual characteristic led anthropologists to as- sign higher nobility to the "Caucasian or Bearded Type" than to the "Mongolic or Beard- less Type." Such interplay of sexual science and racial science appears in eighteenth-century studies that took the male skull and the European male body as the universal subject. These ideas-often not directly articulated-shaped knowledge and also determined access for Eu- ropean women and, with a few notable excep- tions, black men to scientific academies and uni- versities. In her concluding essay, "Nature's Body Wronged," Schiebinger reflects on what the out- comes of scientific work might have been had Europe's "fantasia of nature" been more inclu- sive: "How different our knowledge of the earth's plants and medicines might have been had men and women from around the globe be- gun sharing their knowledge in the eighteenth century as equals, not colonizers and colonized" (p. 206).

Al- though the cultural representation of women, bodies, and nature is often precisely what is at issue, the illustrations also are pertinent now that interest is growing in visual documentation for analysis of science and culture. Additionally, the illustrations are reader-friendly, catching our eye and our attention. Indeed, the reader-friendliness of this book deserves commendation. Schiebinger rightly wants to introduce the new scholarship on gen- der and science to nonspecialist audiences. This goal is appropriate to the book's topic and also to pragmatics in our own sociopolitical and in- tellectual moment, when it is urgently important to bring more readers into friendlier acquain- tance with academia. As creators and dissemi- nators of knowledge, how do we academics craft studies for a broad spectrum of readers? How, by our choice of topics and language, do we make scholarship accessible? Tactical issues of this kind were acknowledged within science cul- ture during the eighteenth century and also the Victorian decades: writers recognized different kinds of audiences-women, children, general readers, scientists who wanted to be up-to-date on research outside their specialization-and shaped texts with diverse narrative forms and for various communities of readers. Issues of gen- der, politics, rhetoric, and religion all combined, then and now, to make the history of science writing another facet of the cultural history of science. In our day, the challenge is to seek out the narrative forms and levels of language that will convey to those who are not (yet) historians of science the intellectual excitement that shapes our work as researchers and analysts. Nature's Body shows well how print culture can serve to arouse the curiosity of readers about the history of science and about science as culture. In its accessible style, level of generalization, broad mappings, and use of visual material and telling detail, Nature's Body is a public educator's book. ANN B. SHTEIR Christian Licoppe. La formation de la pratique scientifique: Le discours de I'experience en France et en Angleterre (1630-1820). (Textes a l'Appui.) 346 pp., bibl. Paris: Editions la Decou- verte, 1996. Fr 240. This book provides a fully worked example of Latourian historiography of science. It deploys numerous themes well known from Bruno La- tour's work to generate what Christian Licoppe represents as a kind of rapprochement between history of science in the French idiom and cul- tural history. (Although published in a series coedited by Latour, the book has surprisingly few citations to his work; Science in Action [1987], for example, does not even appear in the bibliography.) Topically, Licoppe focuses on the changing form of experimental reports in the physical sci- ences. His central concern is with eighteenth- century France, although he includes a prologue on the seventeenth century and, for the sake of comparison, makes occasional forays into En- glish material. The book aims to illuminate the shifting forms of scientific experience, as em- bodied in its literary expression, by correlating them with the sociocultural milieus within which they operated. Licoppe identifies three main forms of experimental proof that were current over the period of his study: the first, which emerged in the seventeenth century, used the rhetoric of the "aristocratic ethos" as the foun- dation for its claim on credibility and tended to be restricted to establishing the truth of a his- torically singular occurrence; the second stressed an integration between the experimental knowl- edge-claim and its alleged utility in the practice of artisans, thereby opening a route toward its universalization; the third, taking us into the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, val- orized "precision" in the production of experi- mental knowledge. There is much of interest in this book, and it contains many striking insights. Licoppe is go- ing for the big picture here, which is admirable; however, it is not always clear how well grounded his large historical generalizations are. Licoppe concentrates on a handful (sometimes just a couple) of exemplary texts to show the form of experimental presentation that he claims dominated in some particular period. This ap- proach enables him to make some penetrating observations but also risks giving the impression that his broader claims are not supported by the evidence. The reader cannot help but see paral- lels between textual features highlighted by&gt;Li- coppe and those found in texts from quite dif- ferent periods; I had to prevent myself from making such connections for eighteenth-century texts that showed very close similarities to texts from the mid-seventeenth century (see, e.g., the bottom of p. 230, on Buffon's use of tables). Licoppe, in other words, needs to give much greater attention to his periodization if he is to make it historically convincing. This criticism does not mean that Licoppe is 731</page></plain_text>
