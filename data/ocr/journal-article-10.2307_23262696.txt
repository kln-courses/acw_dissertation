Instead of measuring salience by subjects "subjec tive" indication of how important being religious is to him/her, we proposed to use a modified TST. Following the Symbolic Interaction theory, we pro pose the order in which the respondent enumerates his/her role identities serves as an indication of the order of their salience. Data were analyzed by the use of two group discriminant statistical techniques. Of thirteen religious variables used in this research, the three which contribute most to salience are church attendance, Bible reading and anthropomorphic view of God. Our data moreover suggests that there is an intrinsic relationship between salience of role identity and need gratification—an hypothesis suggested by Stryker. In the last two decades a plethora of studies were published exploring the multidimensionality of religiosity and its impact on social life. In these studies, religiosity, and by implication religious commitment, has been measured by belief in the existence of God and frequency of ritual performances (which includes church attendance). Generally it was assumed that those who accept orthodox tenets of beliefs regarding God and Jesus, 49</page><page sequence="2">50 Religiosity and Salience of Religious Roles those who maintain traditional religious beliefs in after life and reward and punishment, those who attended church more regularly and those who prayed more frequently were ipso facto more religious (Glock and Stark, 1965; Faulkner and De Jong, 1969). The relationship between religious behavior and religiosity is explainable by social psychological theory which suggest that the greater one's adherence and commitment to role performance and associated norms and values the greater is the salience of that person's role identity (Stryker, 1980). But when examining the relationship between role performance and salience of role identi ty we need also to consider reference group theory as well as the various components of the role performance themselves. Not all people who perform roles even though they do it with equal commitment and diligence will assign the same degree of salience to their role identity associated with these roles. For instance, people who perform the same number of rituals, believe with the same certainty in the existence of God will differ in their self evaluation of their own religiosity.1 In this instance the salience of one's role identity will be affected by his or her reference group. Orthodox Jews and Reform Jews for instance, will differ in their assessment of their own religiosity even when performing the same rituals. We also propose that not all components of a role when performed will have equal impact on the salience of one's role identity. Thus, in the instance of religious identity, we propose that the impact the various elements constituting the belief and ritual dimension have on ones religious role identity will also vary. We propose in this research to investigate the latter problem; to examine the relationship between religiosity and the salience of religious role identity and to explain the nature of that relationship. THE VARIABLES The two concepts central to this research are religious salience and religiosity. Let us now turn and examine these two concepts. Religious Salience For the purpose of this study religious salience will be con ceived from a symbolic interactionist perspective in which religion is perceived as one among a number or role identities which make up the individual's self concept. We define the latter HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-65</page><page sequence="3">Eugen Schoenfeld 51 as "the totality of the individual's thoughts and feelings with reference to one's self as an object" (Rosenberg, 1981:595). The multiple role identities which constitute the social self vary in the degree of salience they have to the individual, that is, they vary in the degree of "probability, for a given person, of a given identity being invoked in a variety of situations" (Stryker, 1968:559). In short, the discrete role identities that constitute the social self are arranged in a hierarchial relationship so that some role identities are in the center of individual's concern while others are more peripheral. Role identities which are more salient and are more in the center of one's concern are more likely to play a part in one's definition of self. Religion is one among the various role identities which a person may include in the construct of his/her social self. Thus among the various role identities the salience of religion is always relative to the other role identities. While to some individuals, religion may indeed be the most salient component in one's social self, to others, it may not. Thus, it would seem reasonable that when measuring the concept in "religious salience" we take into account its relative nature vis a vis other role identities. Yet, a review of the measures of religious salience used in previous researches show that none of them approached it from the symbolic interactionist perspective and hence none con sidered it to be relational. For instance one frequently used method compares clergy responses with those of the laity. This method is validated by the assumption that religion is much more salient to the clergy than the laity (Johnson, 1966; Wood, 1970; Hadden, 1969; Stark et al. 1971). The limitation of this approach, in addition to its non symbolic nature, is that it doesn't provide a measure of salience of religious role for a sam ple of lay persons. A second, and also common measure of salience is based on responses to the question "how important is religion to you?" This approach has two major deficiencies, First, the meaning "important" may not carry the same denota tion among the respondents and second, this approach also fails to indicate the position religion occupies relative to the other identities. We propose to solve this problem by measuring religious salience using a modified Twenty Statement Test. This test is an open ended instrument and is designed to elicit the respondent's self conceptions. Respondents were asked to "write brief statements as answers to the question Who am I" (TST). Following the theory of role salience it has been generally accepted that the order in which the respondent enumerates HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="4">52 Religiosity and Salience of Religious Roles his/her role identities serves as an indicator of the order of their salience (McCall and Simmons, 1966:263). The validity of this test, as a measure of self-concept has been investigated and reported by Kuhn and McPartland (1954). The original instru ment requested the respondents to give twenty statements but in order to avoid fatigue and reluctance to respond, the present instructions reduced the requested responses to five. We felt justified doing so because it was found that under field condi tions the mean number of responses were somewhat greater than four (Mulford and Salisbury, 1964). The respondents were dichotomized into salient and non-salient categories based on their inclusion or exclusion of a religious response to the TST.2 Religiosity The concept religiosity has been extensively analyzed and described in the literature and any further elaboration here would be superfluous (De Jong, 1969; Fukuyama, 1961). Suffice it to say that for this research we have been guided by Glock and Stark's (1965) theoretical and analytical work on religiosity. In short, religiosity in this research is perceived as a multidimen sional phenomenon and defined as the degree to which a unit in a social system indicates a commitment to religious practice, belief and knowledge. To measure the respondents religiosity we have solicited information regarding their religious beliefs and the frequency of participation in religious activities. The measures of belief consisted of responses in the following areas:3 Certainty of belief-. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they are certain about the existence of God. The scale consisted of six items ranging from complete disbelief to definite belief in the existence of God. God view. Respondents were asked to indicate on a four item scale their perception of God. The items ranged from a complete ly anthropomorphic view of God to a completely naturalistic view. Belief in life after death: This six item scale ranged from com plete acceptance to a total rejection of the traditional (orthodox) view. Religious Orthodoxy. Orthodoxy was measured by the respondents' view of Jesus. This index consisted of five items ranging from complete acceptance of Jesus as a son of God to HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 — FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="5">Eugen Schoenfeld 53 doubt of the reality of Jesus. The measures of religious behavior and practice consisted of measures indicated by the frequency of (1) church attendance, (2) prayer, (3) Bible reading, (4) saying grace, (5) participation in electronic church and (6) frequency of participation in non religious church activities. All of these items were treated as single variable measures of religiosity. The Problem The aim of this research, as we noted, is to investigate the rela tionship between religiosity, that is, a commitment to a particular belief and participation in and the performance of rituals and the salience of respondents' religious role identity. There is no doubt that these two are interrelated. In his classical essay Stryker pro poses that "the higher an identity in the salience hierarchy, the higher the probability of role performance consistent with the role expectation attached to that identity" (1968:562). The problem with Stryker's proposition, in addition to his assump tion of a causal relationship, is his treatment of role as though it were a single activity. Roles consist of a number of activities and beliefs associated with a given status. But the manifold role activities, although associated with one's status, are not perceived to have equal importance by the members of a social system and hence to the individual. Thus, in order to examine the relation ship between role performance and identity salience we need be aware of the distinct possibility that not all components of the associated role may have equal impact on salience. We expect, therefore, that the various activities and beliefs which are the role components of the dimensions of religiosity will have differential impact on the salience of religious role identity.4 At this point we need to address ourselves briefly to the con cept of role performances. Just like role identities, role perform ances also vary in their degree of importance. Some are con sidered to be more central and essential to the social system while others more peripheral. Some beliefs and associated activities are in fact considered so fundamental to the social system, that a person who doesn't perform these components of the role is considered by others as an indication of the person's disassocia tion with the collectivity. In short, a person who denies the cen tral beliefs and associated activities of a system indicates by this HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="6">54 Religiosity and Salience of Religious Roles act a lack of identification with and membership in this particular social system.5 Therefore, we expect, that even those who are minimally associated with a particular group will not deviate from or differ in their performance of the central role com ponents of the system of which they are a member. But a commit ment to and performance of fundamental role components although necessary is not sufficient for the development of a salient role identity. We propose that as the salience of one's role identity increases so do the performance of and belief in the less stressed features of a role. If the fundamental aspects of a role can be described as central these features of the role then can be described as being peripheral to a role. In short, what differen tiates those for whom a particular role identity is salient from those to whom it is not is a commitment to and performance of the peripheral role components. For instance, it can be reasonably expected that belief in God which is fundamental to any religious identity, will by itself not differentiate those for whom religious identity is salient from the nonsalient. The con cern of this research, as we stated earlier, is to determine which of the various role components of religiosity will differentiate those for whom religious identity is salient from those to whom it is not. Data and Method Data for this research were collected by means of question naires administered to 404 students at six different universities in several states.6 The present analysis is based on part of that data. Although the sample is not representative of the population in general nor can we claim that it represents the student population of this society, there is enough variation in race, sex, socioeconomic status and religious preference to make meaningful exploratory analysis possible. The central problem is to ascertain the degree to which various components of religiosity are associated with the presence or absence of salient religious identity. We propose that the best way to investigate this problem is to use a two group discriminant analysis, a statistical method which will permit an assessment of how well the set of measures of religiosity will predict the presence or absence of a salient religious identity. The interpreta tion of the discriminant analysis is similar to that of multiple regression analysis. Each variable in the equation acts as a HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="7">Eugen Schoenfeld 55 statistical control on the others. Thus, the discriminant coeffi cients indicate the extent to which each variable contributes to the classification of individuals into one of the two known groups: those with and those without salient religious role identity. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION Inspite of relatively high levels of religiosity manifest by the sample, religious salience as we have measured it in this research is relatively low. Seventy-seven (77) out of a total of 404 respondents (that is 19 percent) have included religion as one of the five descriptions of their social selves. Are these 77 respondents more religious than the rest of the sample? Data in Table 1 show the means and standard deviation of the responses of the two groups to various religious questions. Respondents with high religious salience, that is, those who included religion among the five responses to the "Who am I" question, have scored higher on measures of religious performance but did not differ in the strength of their beliefs. A comparison of the means (in Table 1) show that both groups share the same certainty in the existence of God, that is, respondents in both groups have indicated that they "definitely believe in God." Both groups have similar beliefs regarding Jesus being the son of God and are equally certain of the existence of life after death. They do, however, differ in their religious behavior. Those with salient religious role identity surpass others in the frequency of their church attendance, prayer, performance of various rituals, and are more likely to hold an anthropomorphic view of God. Data in Table 1, suggest that the variables which are more likely to differentiate between those for whom religion is salient from the rest, are religious association and devotion rather than belief. Let us hasten to add here, that we do not intend to minimize the significance belief has on salience of identity. Surely, those for whom religion is salient must start with strong beliefs in the various tenets of their religion. Rather, we wish again to underscore that it is activity and not belief which clearly differen tiates those for whom religion is a salient feature of their role identity from others. To say that salience of religious role identity is related to religious performance is to reiterate the obvious. But since not all religious variables have an equal impact on role identity our aim is to ascertain the independent effect the various religious HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="8">56 Religiosity and Salience of Religious Roles variables have on religious role identity. For this reason we sub jected the data to the two group discriminant function analysis. The analysis of the data show that only five of the thirteen variables included in the equation have an important impact on the variation of religious role salience, that is, that their standar dized coefficients were greater than .20. With the exception of belief in God, in which the two groups didn't differ, there were some differences in means for items of belief in the centrality of love in human association and belief in after life. However, these differences were not important enough to account for the varia tion of saliency in the religious roles. The five variables which had an impact on the variation of religious salience are church attendance, Bible reading, God view, prayer and non religious church activity. For reasons of parsimony we have reanalyzed the data and included in the discriminant analysis only the five above men tioned variables which in the previous analysis had a coefficient larger than .20.7 The canonical correlation when only these five variables and salience were entered into the equation was .527 which is a reduction of only .045 from the .571 attained when all 13 variables were included. In other words, when the thirteen variables were included in the equation 32.60 percent of the varia tion of saliency was explained, of which, 27.78 percent of the variation is explained by the five variables alone.8 A comparison of the classification results in Tables 3 and 4 clearly indicate the efficacy of the five variables as predictors of group membership. When the 13 independent variables were included in the analysis we were able to correctly classify 78.7 percent of the cases (Table 3); the five variables by themselves hardly reduced the percent of correct classifications that is, we had a 78.06 percent success rate of classification. In short, by knowing the degree to which people participate in church, pray, read the Bible, and the type of God they believe in we can predict fairly well the salience of their religious role identity. But how strong is the impact of these five variables on determining religious identity? Data in Table 2 show that of the five variables only frequency of church attendance, frequency of Bible reading, and an anthropomorphic view of God are both significant and important as predictors of identity (i.e., having coefficients greater than .20).9 Let us now examine the implications of our findings. First, we need to comment on the seeming lack of relationship between belief and identity. One would expect that the infra-structure of one's religious identity must surely reside in a belief in a deity. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="9">Eugen Schoenfeld 57 Can one really be religious without faith? The fact that belief in God seemed not to discriminate between the two groups of respondents does not necessarily negate its importance to one's sense of religious identity. The absence of a strong discriminant function coefficient between salience and belief dimension merely indicates the ubiquity of belief to the whole sample. Belief is the single most important condition associated with all states of religiosity, regardless of the degree of the individual's commit ment to religion itself. Belief, we can argue, is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to the formation of a salient religious identity. The analysis of our data have shown that the three crucial variables associated with religious identity are: church atten dance, Bible reading, and a traditional anthropomorphic view of God. We are faced with the inevitable question: What is the nature of these three religious variables? Why do these three variables have a greater impact on role identity salience instead of those variables often assumed to the more important features of religiosity, such as, frequency of prayer, orthodoxy and belief in after life? To answer these questions we propose to examine the three variables from a functionalist perspective, namely to examine the functional consequences of Bible reading, church attendance and anthropomorphism. One of the central features of functional analysis is the view that social institutions, values and the like are functional responses not only to system needs but also to individual needs.10 Malinowski (1948), for instance, has argued that both religion and magic can be seen as entities functioning to satisfy human needs. But what personal needs does religion satisfy? From a functionalist perspective, religion seeks to deal with frustration associated with blocked goals, to alleviate problems arising from disappointments and frustration and to provide meaning and sense to the world in which one exists (Davis, 1950:532). In short, it can be said that religion provides for individuals a degree of security in a world which otherwise lies outside of their control (See Malinowski, 1948). Using a similar approach Kanter (1972) proposes that commitment to a group is enhanced because the association and activities within the group provide for a person's gratification. In her analysis of commune life Kanter (1972) reports that the three factors which increase commitment to the commune are associated with the consequences of social participation, the development of effective ties among commune members and the presence of conditions which provide clear HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 1 — FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="10">58 Religiosity and Salience of Religious Roles direction to life through moral and normative structures. Need gratification increases not only commitment it also increases the salience of one's role identity. Stryker, for instance proposes: The greater the commitment premised on an identity, the more that identity will be invested with a positive cathectic response; and the more a given identity is invested with a positive cathectic response, the higher will be that identity in the salience hierarchy (Stryker, 1968:561-562). He further proposes that: The greater the commitment premised on identity, the more that identity will be perceived as instrumental to "wants" of persons; and the more a given identity is perceived as instrumental to "wants," the higher will be that identity in the salience hierarchy (Stryker, 1968:562). It therefore stands to reason that if certain role performances are associated with salience of identity, these role performances are therefore seen as contributing to wants, that is, that they satisfy certain needs. We would like to suggest that the three religious variables, church attendance, anthropomorphic view of God, and Bible reading contribute to religious salience because they may in fact gratify needs similar to those that Kanter found to contribute to high commitment to the commune. Let us now consider the way these three variables contribute to personal gratification." Church Attendance The importance of participation in collective life to one's well being has already been observed and reported. While the church is but one of the variety of voluntary associations in which one can participate it has certain advantages over other voluntary associations. First, the church is more readily available than other formal associations. Even more important than conveni ence and availability, is that, membership and participation in the church is considered normative and laudable.12 The nature of church activity and it's gemeinschaft like association creates strong emotional feelings among its members. It can be argued that the church, more than any other voluntary association, comes closest in providing the conditions observed in communes, HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="11">Eugen Schoenfeld 59 as the place "where a person's fundamental emotional needs can be expressed" (Kanter, p.72). The expressive function of the church and the kinship like association among its members pro vides for social integration and through it the participant achieves both meaning and security which helps the individual to face the exigencies associated with life (See Berger 1967). Anthropomorphic view of God The second religiosity variable which according to our data has an important association with salience is an anthropomorphic view of God. On the one hand God has been defined as the central symbol of the religious community as a whole, and thus, an attachment to God is also an attachment to one's community (Durkheim, 1961). On the other hand, God is also seen to tran scend man and the collectivity and to be independent of the col lective. From the latter perspective God is not seen as a symbol and a part of the community, instead, He is seen as their creator, He is envisioned as the One who controls and determines the fate of the individual, the collective, and the world as a whole.13 Thus, in addition to group or communal membership, personal security is also related to belief in a supreme and benevolent power. But just as the community which gives the individual a sense of security cannot be impersonal, so too, the God who is also seen as a source of security cannot be an impersonal God but a personal God who like a father with human qualities relates to his children (See Feurbach, 1957). Anthropomorphism, the second of the variables which the data indicated to be related to religious salience, is likely to be associated with a belief in a personal and benevolent God who takes a personal interest in all of his creatures, particularly in the respondent. Bible reading Biblical stories of creation and miracles further reinforce in the individual the sense of a personal relationship with God. To the reader, the miracles which are depicted in the Bible, are seen as God's response to individual needs. These stories depict God as One who makes extraordinary things occur to satisfy a particular person's need, can be taken as further evidence of God's personal love and care. Thus Biblical stories, we propose, reinforce one's HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="12">60 Religiosity and Salience of Religious Roles sense of security, a security which is similar to the one Kanter suggests arises out of membership in the collective. In addition to enhancing personal security, Bible reading, we propose, also increases a commitment to one's community, which according to Kanter satisfies the need for meaning, order and predictability. This need is gratified through "a process whereby an individual attaches his decision-making perogative to a power greater than himself, surrendering to the higher meaning contained by the group and submitting to something beyond himself" (Kanter, p.74). The relationship of meaning acquisition and religion has been central to the sociological analysis of religion. Beginning with Durkheim's analysis of primitive religions, religion has been seen as the institution which provides the individual with a system of meanings which affects the nature of social association, legitimates the social order, Weltanschuungen and theodicies (Berger, 1967; Berger and Luckman, 1966; Luckman, 1967; Geertz, 1966). In short, religion provides for a meaning system which is perceived to be universal. The idea of a universal meaning system and a moral order has long been associated with the Bible and its definitions of the universe is central to the infrastructure of the Christian meaning system. Therefore it can be assumed that religious salience should be associated with Bible reading. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS It was the intent of this study to investigate the impact that various dimensions of religiosity have on the salience of religious role identity. Of the thirteen religious variables included in this research, our analysis has shown that the three which contribute most to salience are church attendance, Bible reading and anthropomorphic view of God. Following Kanter's findings we suggest that the reasons for these relationships is that these variables, more than others contribute to the individual's sense of security through association, a personal view of God and the meaning system. Our data suggest that there is an intrinsic relationship between salience of role identity and need gratifica tion—an hypothesis suggested by Stryker. Moreover, we have also found that functional analysis, which lately has not been in vogue, does provide for a useful paradigm for data interpreta tions. We need to leave the reader with the following caveat. Both the nature of the data and the mode of analysis makes this HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 12 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1984-85</page><page sequence="13">Eugen Schoenfelcl 61 analysis at best speculative. It is hoped, however, that it will lead to farther study in the nature of religiosity and its relationship with religious identity.

This problem is well exemplified in the following event which occurred in a large southern city. A man approached the Rabbi of a Reformed Jewish Congregation seeking affiliation with the temple. The Rabbi queried the new prospect's motives for seeking this association. The applicant replied: "Well, you see Rabbi, I am not very religious." The rabbi became very indignant and remarked: "Just because we do not perform all the ascribed rituals or pray as frequently as our orthodox brethren, does not make us less religious." 2. The order in which the responses were given can be used as a score for an ordinal scale of identity salience, but due to the small size of the sample and other criticism on the validity of this method of ordinal scaling we felt that a two category distinction (i.e. nominal scale) would, in this instance, be adequate. 3. The measures of certainty of belief, life after death, religious orthodoxy were taken from the questionnaire on "Perspectives on Life in Todays World." Survey Research Center University of California, Berkeley. 4. We shall treat the components of religiosity as aspects of role performances. 5. In Judaism, for instance, one may forego all behavioral norms if the ensuing non conformity may save a life. But regardless of consequences one may not deny the existence of God. Such denial is considered as the rejection of the essential foundation of Judaism. 6. Respondents were students from Georgia State University, Univer sity of Maryland, University of Conneticut, University of Houston, Texas Tech and the University of Nevada. Mean age was 20.9. The sample consisted of 59.6 percent women. Eighty percent of the sample were white and 14.9 percent were black. 7. We arbitrarily took .20 as an indicator of the independent variable's importance to the variation of the dependent variable. 8. The squared canonical correlation can be treated like R2, that is, as an indicator of the percent of the variation of dependent variable explained by the independent variables in the same equation.
