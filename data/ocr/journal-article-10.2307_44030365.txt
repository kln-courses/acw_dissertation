<plain_text><page sequence="1">Informed by Rushdie's non-fiction, the social history of photography in India, and the work of Debord and Sontag, in this reading of Midnight's Children, I contend that Rushdie uses fictional photographs to stage a realist satire of colonial and nationalist ideologies, thus countering various attempts to label Midnight's Children as magic realism or exoticism. Airbrushed History: Photography, Realism, and Rushdie's Midnight's Children EDWARD BARNABY A Mahatma media demnation campaign Gandhi from Salman for and Macintosh the Rushdie. caption Dismayed computers "think different" that that such featured elicited a complex a a vehement photograph and enigmat- con- of Mahatma Gandhi and the caption "think different" elicited a vehement con- demnation from Salman Rushdie. Dismayed that such a complex and enigmat- ic figure, one who opposed the technological modernization of India, should be reduced to visual shorthand for an imperialist narrative of progress, Rushdie offered the following lament: "[Gandhi] has become abstract, ahistorical, postmodern, no longer a man in and of his time but a free-floating concept, a part of the available stock of cultural symbols, an image that can be borrowed, used, distorted, reinvented, to fit many different purposes, and to the devil with historicity or truth" ( Step 166). This induction of Gandhi's image into the catalogue of corporate clip art is a vivid symptom of the "society of the spectacle" featured in the title of Guy Debord s 1967 Situationist work. Debord astutely observes the manner in which the proliferation of images in industrialized society has evolved into the production of false realities. For Mosaic 38/1 0027- 1276-05/00 10 16$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) Debord, a veil of images has been drawn between the individual and an authentic expe- rience of time and history, thus concealing capitalist transformation beneath an emerg- ing cultural amnesia and subjecting society to accelerating cycles of consumption. The manipulation of photographs as part of the spectacle's validation of ideolo- gy and commodification of culture is a recurring motif in both the political history of India and Rushdie's non-fiction. Thus the photograph plays a substantial role in framing Rushdie's critique of spectacle, and it is through Situationist critiques of pho- tography articulated by Susan Sontag and John Berger that Rushdie has been most influenced by Debord's discourse. Sontag and Berger both echo the vocabulary of Debord's concept of détournement, the process whereby the "despotism of a fragment imposing itself as the pseudo-knowledge of a frozen whole" is restored to "its context, its own movement and ultimately the overall frame of reference of its period" (Debord 145-46). In On Photography, Susan Sontag describes the photograph simi- larly as a "fragment," a "quotation [. . .] open to any kind of reading," falsely regarded as a "piece of reality" (71, 74). Just as Debord accuses the spectacle of naturalizing a socially conditioned way of seeing, Sontag writes that "photographs have become the norm for the way things appear to us, thereby changing the very idea of reality and of realism" (87). It is through photography, Sontag concludes, that "history is converted into spectacle," "people become customers of reality," and "every subject is depreciated into an article of consumption [and] promoted into an item for aesthetic apprecia- tion" (1 10). Applying the concept of détournement to photography, Berger argues that photography must be represented in a "radial system" of words and other images to ensure that it serves as a contextual aid to social and political memory and is not used to construct a linear narrative that substitutes in a fascist manner for memory (292-3). What has not been so clearly understood is that this discourse on photography and spectacle informs Rushdie's fiction as well. In spite of the context provided by Rushdie's essays, the critical response to Midnight's Children has struggled to discern the novel's relationship to imperialist ideology and often suggests that the novel con- tributes, even if unwittingly, to the spectacle of India as an exotic "other." Certain postcolonial theorists regard the European geographical location and educational tra- dition from which Rushdie writes as grounds to disqualify his portrayal of Indian society as participating in the imperialist gaze, while others have indicted Rushdie's participation in a capitalist publishing scheme that markets Anglo-Indian writers within the discourse of the exotic (see Barnett and Huggan). Some have even ques- tioned whether fictional critiques of imperialism are capable of prompting an ethical response from the reader or simply reinforce the spectacle of empire (see Rosaldo and Ahmad). Graham Huggan, for one, seems to recognize Rushdie's attempt to parody</page><page sequence="3">Edward Barnaby 3 the colonial situation, yet dismisses this political gesture as "vulnerable to recupera- tion" insofar as the uncritical reader could potentially be drawn into "rehearsing a continuing history of imperialist perceptions of an 'othered' India" (81). Rushdie's depiction of visual culture in Midnight's Children , however, achieves precisely the opposite effect, portraying how the spectacle was operative in both the colonial vision of India held by the Raj and the nationalist vision of India advanced by the independence movement. Often read misleadingly as fantasy or magic realism through a strictly postcolonial lens, Midnight's Children is more holistically under- stood as a realist satire of the neuroses of an Indian man who becomes convinced by the competing imagery and rhetoric of the spectacles of imperialism and nationalism that the events of his life mirror the historical narrative of modern India. To discredit Rushdie's abilities as a satirist precisely because of his access to the tradition of social realism in the European novel, or because the imperceptive reader might take too lit- erally the more ironic or grotesque moments of the text, exhibits a certain willingness to misunderstand Rushdie's politics and his fiction. In order to gauge what Huggan regards as the novel's lack of "oppositional power" (71), perhaps clearer definition is needed as to what exactly Midnighťs Children opposes. The narrative voice of this novel openly comments on the falsification of reality through propagandistic con- structions of history. The novel in general satirizes the fascist spectacle of British cul- tural superiority that the Raj foisted upon the historical memory and visual culture of India during its occupation. Furthermore, it satirizes the way in which these dynam- ics were then adopted and perpetuated by India's own nationalist movement. Rushdie accomplishes this by "replaying" for the reader (to use Anuradha Needham's term) the struggle of an Indian man to find meaning and authentic experi- ence among these competing unrealities. Needham observes that it is typical for writers of a diaspora to advance "reconstructions [that] contest and/or call into question the truth of the dominant, colonial histories of their 'homelands'" (15). However, because Saleem's narrative straddles the transfer of power in India from the British to the nationalists, the dominant discourse Rushdie "replays" undergoes a similar shift. Rush- die attempts to demonstrate how nationalist discourse perpetuates the spectacle first introduced under colonial rule by replaying both discourses for the reader. As a result, exclusively postcolonial readings of Midnighťs Children are susceptible to interpreting Rushdie's "replaying" of the nationalist spectacle not as satire, but as sympathy for the colonizers. This technique of "replay" aligns with various theorizations of realism by critics such as Georg Lukàcs, Philip Rahv, and Pierre Macherey in which fiction allows the reader to encounter ideology in a broad historical context that deconstructs its otherwise</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) compelling internal logic. Macherey regards realism not as a naturalistic aesthetic, but as a rhetorical mirror that foregrounds the incompleteness of any representation of reality. For Macherey, realist fiction makes possible an "escape from the domain of spontaneous ideology, [ . . . ] from the false consciousness of self, of history, and of time" by perform- ing various ideologies within the text and establishing them "as visible objects" (132, 133). Philip Rahv similarly argues that "the kind of casuistry which may easily pose for truth within the pseudo-context of a political speech or editorial will be exposed in all its emptiness once it is injected into the real context of a living experience, such as the art of fiction tries to represent" (303). It is precisely this function of realism that David Price identifies as Rushdie's achievement in Midnight's Children when he writes, "The power of governments to manipulate images and information is so immense and the reservoir of the cultural semiotic so deep that the writer remains one of the few people who can construct an entire narrative in opposition to [...] unidimensional, simplistic, reductive, slogan-laden messages" (105). Each of these statements parallels realism with Debord's concept of détournement as a means of exposing the dynamic of spectacle by reinserting the totalitarian visions of various ideologies within the contin- gency and subjectivity of an historical context. Rushdie, in fact, identifies himself as a realist. Theoretically, he aligns himself with the likes of Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, and John Berger in regarding realism not as a representational convention, but as an ethic that compels an artist to "attempt to respond as fully as possible to the circumstances of the world in which the artist works" (Rushdie, Imaginary 210). Stylistically, Rushdie acknowledges his attempt to model Midnight's Children after the Dickensian novel, in which, he observes, "details of place and social mores are skewered by a pitiless realism, a naturalistic exactitude." It is, in Rushdie's words, "against a scrupulously observed social and historical background - against, that is, the canvas of a 'real' India" that he pursues his satire of India's grotesque political and historical narrative ( Step 64). Those generic who blinders seek to on define the text Midnighťs that ultimately Children obscure as fantasy its discourse or magic on realism spectacle place and generic blinders on the text that ultimately obscure its discourse on spectacle and inscribe the novel within the very terms of otherness and exoticism that Rushdie attempts to expose. Peter Brigg reads Midnighťs Children as a fantasy that Rushdie constructs in order to subvert the self-legitimizing rationalism of colonial ideology with a more mythical and anthropomorphic view of history told by an individual (127). Brigg's analysis, however, overlooks the psychological realism of the narrator Saleem's narcissistic relationship to history during his childhood. Rushdie has noted that "the idea of placing Saleem center-stage in so many political events came to him</page><page sequence="5">Edward Barnaby 5 because a child usually sees himself center-stage" (Parameswaran 40). Furthermore, the adult Saleem's rigorously theorized relationship to history as various combinations of "active" and "passive," "literal" and "metaphorical" influences between the micro- cosm and macrocosm represents a concerted effort on Rushdie's part to maintain a connection between Saleem's often logistically strained narrative and an objective social reality (Rushdie, Midnight's 286). Indeed, Rusdie refuses to allow Saleem to stray into the self-affirming confines of myth and fantasy. Even Saleem's least fantastic assertions are undercut with allusions to his unreliability, including admissions of lapses in judgement, misremembered facts, outright lies, and failing sanity. Any foray into the fantastic by Saleem is quickly circumscribed by his companion Padma, whose impatience for the abstract and improbable has been described as the "realistic and tangible foil so necessary to keep the narrative to the ground" (Parameswaran 44). Rushdie once explained to a BBC director charged with adapting the novel for the screen that "many of the novel's apparently 'magical' moments had naturalistic explanations" and that "however highly fabulated parts of the novel were, the whole was deeply rooted in the real life of the characters and the nation" ( Step 72). Saleem's overtly unreliable narrative also calls into question readings of Midnight's Children as magic realism. A defining trait of magic realism is that its supernatural ele- ments are "admitted, accepted and integrated into the rationality and materiality of lit- erary realism" (Zamora and Faris 3). Saleem's self-confessed instability and Padma's constant objections to the outlandish, however, establish a clear antagonism between the real and the surreal in Midnight's Children . In fact, this antagonism between reality and the various idealizations of history circulating throughout India are central to the novel's critique of spectacle, a critique that is obscured when certain scenes are cited out of context as instances of magic realism. Wendy Faris, for example, identifies "verbal magic" and literalized metaphors as traits of magic realism and points to Saleem's propensity for hearing the voices of the other children of midnight in his head as a symptom of these traits (176). However, this unnecessarily exoticizes what is more compellingly read from the realist stand- point as a satire of the neuroses wrought by the nationalist movement's monumen- talist historical narratives. One must not forget that Saleem grows up in the shadow of a ceremonial letter that Nehru sent to Saleem's mother on the occasion of his birth and which hangs on the wall of his nursery. With inflated political rhetoric, Nehru ele- vates to symbolic status the life of this child who happens to be born on the midnight of the transfer of power from the British, thus converting Saleem into an image of unity within the spectacle of nationalism. Rushdie's satire illustrates what happens</page><page sequence="6">6 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) when Saleem accepts the spectacle of nationalism as a literal and objective social real- ity. Saleem becomes a repository for the competing voices, beliefs, and traditions of individuals who are portrayed in Nehrus rhetoric as the unified and independent India. By the end of the novel, Saleem's psychological strain and the appearance of cracks on his skin (that only he can see) signal his inability to live out this nationalist identity. Faris identifies an attitude of "freshness" and "childlike" innocence towards the world as another trait of magic realism, one which she locates in the simple pleasure Aadam Aziz takes in observing the spring day in the Kashmir at the opening of the novel (177). Such a reading, however, disregards the imperialist context of this scene, namely Aadam s recent return from Europe after studying medicine in Germany for five years and the narrator's nostalgia for a time when the landscape was not scarred by war. Rushdie's point is not that Aadam and the narrator somehow maintain a magically childlike relationship with nature in spite of their experiences. Not only does the narra- tor observe that the pristine landscape before Aadam's eyes in 1915 would later be oblit- erated by the tread of soldiers, but he also notes that, even then, Aadam had come to view this landscape as provincial and stifling upon his return from the West {Midnight's 5). It is significant, however, that Rushdie anchors his critique of the spectacle in Midnight's Children with this deconstruction of the picturesque landscape, an aesthetic convention that has been widely associated with the visual culture of imperialism. He "replays" this trope of landscape description with an irony that is not lost upon those familiar with similar scenes at the onset of many a British and European novel. Far from countering Western rationalism with Eastern mysticism (and thus pan- dering to the very binary social formulations the text strives to move beyond), Mid- night's Children performs "the secularization of the magical religion of fate into the realistic science of psychology" that Fredric Jameson identifies as a symptom of the generic shift from romance to realism ("Magical" 144). Rushdie embodies the Indian predicament in the neuroses and insecurities of a child whose auspicious birthdate has thrust him into a battle for hegemony between a collapsing colonial historical narra- tive and the equally surreal nationalist fiction that supplanted it. Thus Rushdie has internalized within Saleem what Jameson describes as the hallmark of realism, name- ly "a society torn between past and future in such a way that the alternatives are grasped as hostile but somehow unrelated worlds" ("Magical" 158). Those who are quick to deny the realism of this text, however, tend to focus on Jameson's pronounce- ment in The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act that realism is characterized by "containment strategies" that naturalize the experience of capitalist culture and thus render the text complicit in the formation of the spectacle (193).</page><page sequence="7">Edward Barnaby 7 Haunted by Jameson (and often paraphrasing his ideas), these critics attempt to cat- egorize Midnight's Children as magic realism and fantasy out of some perceived need to insulate the novel from any claims that its realism reinforces the spectacle instead of critiquing it. The later Jameson of The Cultural Turn: Selected Writings on the Postmodern , 1983-1998 , however, leaves open the question of whether all realist rep- resentation has been commodified to the extent that it is no longer capable of for- mulating a critique of its own production (20). Furthermore, it is the indiscriminate use of the term magic realism , as Stephen Slemon suggests, that ultimately produces this naturalizing effect by "offer [ing] centralizing genre systems a single locus upon which the massive problem of difference in literary expression can be managed into recognizable meaning in one swift pass" (408). Rushdie's to raise consciousness self-proclaimed of the realism epidemic coupled of spectacle with his in consistent our "image-saturated attempts elsewhere times" to raise consciousness of the epidemic of spectacle in our "image-saturated times" suggests that the presence of photography in Midnight's Children participates in the satire of colonial and nationalist ideology in India. Why, for example, does Saleem's grandmother Naseem, also known as the Reverend Mother, react so violently to having her photograph taken? Is this merely the local colour of a tall tale through which Rushdie depicts the quaintness of oral culture? Is Naseem a superstitious native whom Rushdie invites us to join him in ridiculing? Or is it more consistent with Rushdie's body of work to suggest that he identifies photography in this scene as an agent of the spectacle that inscribes India within a Western technology of representation? Rushdie himself intimates the latter, explaining that this scene suggests "something predatory about photography" and comparing the Reverend Mother's instinct to resist the pho- tographer to Princess Diana's fatal attempt to flee the voyeuristic lenses of the paparazzi (Step 104, 109-110). The turbulent marriage of Saleem's grandfather, Aadam Aziz, and Naseem is no ordinary narrative of domestic squabbling, but pits nothing less than the integrity of Indian society against European cultural imperialism. These characters perform a func- tion that Georg Lukàcs regards as the achievement of the historical novel, namely that social forces in conflict are "brought into a human relationship with one another [. . .] whose clash expresses artistically a great crisis in society" (36). The Reverend Mother's refusal to sit for the photographer Aadam commissioned to take portraits of his fami- ly must be read against the backdrop of a growing tension between Naseem's traditional Indian upbringing and certain Western attitudes toward science, sex, and politics that Aadam adopted while studying medicine in Heidelberg. Although Aadam returns to India after five years in Germany because he is offended by the ethnocentrism of his</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) European friends, he has nevertheless been acculturated by the West and is somewhat alienated from his native country. Emblazoned with the word Heidelbergy Aadam's medicine bag becomes a divisive visual icon within his small town. He burns Naseem's veils to force her to abandon the purdah against her will and become a more sexual- ly liberated "modern Indian woman" ( Midnight's 33). He whistles "O Tannenbaum" while riding his bicycle down the street. Such details cast Aadam's desire to photo- graph his family as a bourgeois imitation of the European practice of portraiture. In such a light, the Reverend Mother's stance as "an ironclad citadel of traditions and certainties" functions not simply as the humorous hyperbole of magic realism, but signals the reader that her character has assumed a socio-historical dimension. To comprehend fully the Reverend Mother's indignation, one must have some sense of the social connotations of the photograph in India that inform Rushdie's novel. Photography was first introduced to India by the British shortly after its inven- tion in 1839 for the imperialist purpose of topographical surveying. Photographs also featured prominently in British travel guides, which served to create a predictable and repeatable pictorial journey through the subcontinent that rendered India transparent to Western tourists as an extension of the Empire (32). By the time of the Calcutta International Exhibition in 1883, the colonial counterpart to London's Great Exhibi- tion at the Crystal Palace three decades earlier, photography had come to play an important role in the colonial establishment's ability not only to catalogue data regard- ing all aspects of Indian society, but also to display its "indexical power" and ability to "order reality" (Hoffenberg 180; Pinney 266-7). Photography came to be associated in India with the imperialist "intoxication with precision and exactitude both descriptive and spatial" and was viewed as complicit in the dehumanizing statistical "efficiency" of colonial government (Pinney 269). Sontag illuminates this imperialist aspect of photography in her critique of the photographer as a "supertourist" and an "extension of the anthropologist" who is per- petually "visiting natives and bringing back news of their exotic doings" and "trying to colonize new experience" (42). This perspective enables one to regard the Reverend Mother's behaviour as driven not by ignorance, fear, or spite, but a deep resentment of Westernization that sitting for the photographer represents. Sontag observes that people in non-industrialized countries often resist being photographed as if it were "some sort of trespass, disrespect, or sublimated cultural looting," whereas people in industrialized countries (where the spectacle holds sway) tend to feel that they are "made real by the photograph" and "incorporated into the historical record" (161). Rushdie embodies this cultural divide in the conflict between Aadam and the Rever- end Mother. Aadam, in effect, becomes an unwitting agent of the spectacle in his</page><page sequence="9">Edward Barnaby 9 desire to display his wife and children as "life-sized blow-up photographs" on the wall of his living room, whereas the Reverend Mother regards this as an intolerable degree of exposure and objectification. Saleem observes that Naseem "was not one to be trapped in anyone's little black box" and, as if in triumphant defiance of the panopti- cal gaze of the European lens, notes that "there are no photographs of my grand- mother anywhere on earth" ( Midnight's 41). This sentiment was echoed in the decision by India's government in the 1960s to replace photographs of national monuments in Indian textbooks with pen and ink drawings. Indian artists were thus enabled to strip the images of any picturesque ele- ments in the photographs reminiscent of the staged exoticism of landscape photog- raphy commissioned by the Raj (Chatterjee 283). This effected a symbolic reversal of publishing practices a century earlier in which picturesque elements not found in India's landscapes were added by English engravers when adapting photographs to metal plates for use in British travel literature (Falconer 161). The photography- free textbooks were intended to undermine the literal interpretation of photographic real- ism, which might suggest to the spectator that the photograph provides true access to or even possession of a geographical space and its historical reality (Chatterjee 283; Sontag 9). Ironically, however, the elimination of any geographical or social context in the drawings of the monuments transformed them into a sacred iconography that merely traded the romanticism of the colonial vision for that of the nationalist one. The picturesque antiquarianism of the state- sponsored photography of the Raj sug- gested the need for British stewardship of Indias decaying heritage, while the nation- alists' sublime portrayal of Indian architectural monuments concealed the historical reality of India's political disunity. In either case, history is transformed into specta- cle, an opportunistic quotation of reality taken out of context to bolster an ideology. It is this ambivalent use of India's architectural monuments within successive spectacles of national fragmentation and national unity that Rushdie satirizes through Lifafa Das's travelling "peepshow." As an entertainer who peddles his montage of pho- tographs among small villages throughout India, Lifafa is the embodiment of specta- cle, exploiting the touristic impulse with his enticement to "See the whole world, come see everything!" {Midnight's 84). This "world" is comprised entirely of photographs, principally those of famous sites such as the Taj Mahal, the Meenakshi Temple, and the Ganges River. Not wanting to insulate his audience from the "not-so-pleasant features of his age," Lifafa attempts to introduce an element of social realism to his show by incorporating occasional images of contemporary political figures and scenes of poverty and social protest. Ultimately, however, any political consciousness in his selec- tion of photographs is recuperated within the overall commodified voyeurism of the</page><page sequence="10">10 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) exhibition. Lifafas inclusion of a publicity photograph of "Carmen Verandah" points to a latently pornographic aspect of his "peepshow" that aligns it with other visual spectacles, such as the stereoscope, which had become widely associated in Europe with the viewing of erotic imagery by the end of the nineteenth century ( Midnight's 84; Crary 127). Like bacchants swept into a destructive frenzy, children swarm around Lifafa and impatiently clamour to view the images. As Lifafa attempts to pacify them, a young girl notices some political graffiti that happens to have been painted on the wall behind him and accuses Lifafa of being a Hindu, whereupon a riot ensues. It is not the realism of Lifafa's photographs that produces this violent response, as one might have suspected, but the irrationality of the crowd, desperate to participate in the spectacle itself. Although Rushdie has been criticized for "collapsing cultural politics into eth- nic spectacle" in his novels, it appears that this is precisely the object of his satire in depicting the character of Lifafa Das (Huggan 67). Saleem's abrupt adoption of the jargon of a film director to narrate the scene in which Lifafa s peepshow arrives in Delhi foregrounds the various ways in which visual perception is manipulated within the spectacle. Saleem decides to shoot the scene from a "foreshortened" aerial per- spective, presumably to heighten the dramatic effect and provide the reader with a global view of the events that parodies the claims of the peepshow itself. Saleem's visual composition of the scene recalls the groundless perspective of many nine- teenth-century European landscape paintings, an imaginary panoptical vantage point that has been associated with the imperialist gaze (see Heisinger). The last one hears of Lifafa is that he has become obsessed with adding more and more photo- graphs to his collection in a quixotic pursuit of literal realism. Echoing Sontag's cri- tique of photography as falsely conveying "the sense of holding the whole world in our hands as an anthology of images" (3), Saleem questions whether Lifafas "urge to encapsulate the whole of reality" is an "Indian disease" that infects his own narrative (Midnight's 84). While on the surface Rushdie seems to blame India for taking Western realism too literally, Saleenťs question is quite obviously an ironic one. Hardly an Indian disease, the substitution of photographs for physical and historical reality derives from what has been described as the "museumizing imagination" that emerged in Europe during the nineteenth century (Pelizzari 37). Ethnographic studies of India commissioned by the British East India Company to optimize colonial administration, scholarly studies of Indian civilization that legitimized British intervention, and travel literature that commodified India for consumption by British tourists relied heavily on the photo- graph's apparent realism for their authority (Guha-Thakurta 121; Hoffenberg 191). At</page><page sequence="11">Edward Barnaby 1 1 this time, the photograph enjoyed an aura of objectivity that was not heavily scruti- nized, as it appeared, in comparison to landscape painting, to be a relatively scientif- ic means of reproducing reality (Bann 64-5). As a result, one reads of photographs being praised for their "picturesque" potential and historical "legibility," as in James Fergusson's 1848 volume titled Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindostán (Guha-Thakurta 123). Exemplifying what Sontag has critiqued as the photograph's enactment of a "surrealist abbreviation of history," Fergusson con- structs a romanticized historical narrative of Indian architectural styles years after returning from his field work in India, a dubious methodology that participates in a growing trend at the time whereby text and images displaced the authority of direct site observation (Sontag 68; Guha-Thakurta 123). This reliance on photographs as an objective historical record becomes even more problematic in light of the nation- alist movement's appropriation of photographs originally commissioned by the Raj. For example, British photographs of the aftermath of the Sepoy Rebellion in 1858, which were originally taken to document the savagery of uncivilized India, were eventually incorporated into nationalist history textbooks and recaptioned to vilify the British occupiers (Gupta 238). It is this fluidity in meaning of photographic images that Rushdie satirizes through Saleem's recollection of certain "memories of a mildewed photograph" (Midnight's 45). Supposedly taken at a meeting of the leaders of an underground pro- independence organization, the photograph features Aadam Aziz, the Rani of Cooch Naheen, Mian Abdullah (an activist also known as the Hummingbird), and Nadir Khan (the Hum- mingbird's personal secretary and a poet). These four were spearheading the formation of the Free Islam Convocation out of dozens of Muslim splinter groups as a political alternative to the Muslim League, a Pakistani independence group whom the Rani describes as "landowners with vested interests to protect [ . . . ] who go like toads to the British and form governments for them" ( Midnight's 47-8). Saleem recalls specific visual details from the photograph alongside vignettes of dialogue from the conversa- tion among those pictured. The visual details he provides, however, directly contradict his recollection of the conversation. Furthermore, if one is to trust Saleem's memory, the participants in this meeting spend their time discussing not political strategy, but the role of social realism in the arts. Each of Saleem's recollections of the conversation that allegedly took place at the time of the photograph is contradicted by the image. According to Saleem, the Hummingbird tells Aziz that he is in great shape and asks Aziz to punch him in the stomach, yet Saleem notes that the "folds of a loose white shirt conceal the stomach, and my grandfather's fist is not clenched but swallowed up by the hand of the ex-conjurer."</page><page sequence="12">12 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) Saleem observes that the Rani "was going white in blotches" a phenomenon plausibly explained as an overexposed negative, the deterioration of the mildewed photograph, or an actual skin disease. Saleem, however, extrapolates this into a metaphorical symp- tom of Anglicization, "a disease which leaked into history and erupted on an enormous scale shortly after Independence." Saleem claims that the Rani described herself to the others in the picture as "the hapless victim of [. . .] cross-cultural concerns" and her skin as "the outward expression of the internationalism of [her] spirit." Saleem then recounts how Nadir Khan shyly described his dabbling in poetry to the others in the picture, assuring the reader that Nadir's feet "would be shuffling in embarrassment" if they were not "frozen by the snapshot" (Midnight's 46). Indeed, one is never told how Saleem has become privy to what is discussed at the meeting, as the photograph certainly cannot provide this information and the meeting occurred before he was born. Perhaps even more curious is Saleem's claim that these characters, having con- vened to discuss the future of their controversial political organization, were purport- edly debating the merits of social realism in modernist poetry. Just as the photographs of the Sepoy Rebellion were commandeered to validate both colonial and nationalist historical accounts, Saleem appears to have recaptioned this photograph to serve his own rhetorical strategy in Midnight's Children , namely to focus the reader on issues of representation. There is, in fact, no visual evidence in the photograph of any conversa- tion or debate, with each character described by Saleem as wearing a "foolish, rigid smile." Saleem refers to the four as consummate ventriloquists whose non-moving lips he must attempt to read within the photograph's "still, immobile scene." Saleem ulti- mately exhausts his memory of the image, declaring that "the photograph has run out of words" C Midnight's 46). The ambivalence of Saleem's ekphrastic account of this fic- tional photograph dramatizes Sontag's critique of photography in general as "open to any kind of reading" as well as her argument that "only that which narrates can make us understand" (Sontag 71, 23). One could accept the account of this photograph at face value as an absurdist ges- ture or evidence of Saleem's magical power to intuit subtexts. It is improbable, however, that the participants in a clandestine meeting of a subversive political organization would ever have posed for such a photograph. There is no mention of who took this photograph, why it was taken, the circumstances under which Saleem once saw it, or how he came to have such an intimate knowledge of the substance of the meeting itself. Indeed, not even the more significant event of Mian Abdullah's assassination shortly after this meeting is preserved in the public record, but is suppressed by the British authorities and perpetuated only in the local oral culture. From a realistic perspective, it is quite possible that Saleem invents this photograph (it is present in the novel only</page><page sequence="13">Edward Barnaby 13 through the narrator's memory) in order to endow these marginalized figures, other- wise known only through small-town gossip, with the aura of historical legitimacy. By placing them in a photograph, Saleem makes them real within the spectacle and invests them with the value accorded by Western society to such images. This photograph, with its forced smiles and tacit tensions, is strongly reminiscent of propagandistic photographs commissioned by the British East India Company of various puppet governments and theatre states just like those maintained by the Muslim League in Midnight's Children. Two such staged photographs in particular taken by Company photographer Linnaeus Tripe in the mid-nineteenth century exemplify what Debord has called the "immobilized spectacle of non-history" (Debord 150-51). They portray the Raja with his assembly in a hall decorated in a suspiciously Victorian style, as well as seated at his desk signing an official order "under the watch- ful gaze of a Brahman bureaucrat and the colonial state" (Dirks 212). The stiff, forced aspect of Rushdie's photo of the leaders of the Free Islam Convocation not only paro- dies the spectacle of propagandistic photography in colonial India, but reminds the reader that the nationalist movement, described by Saleem as "the optimism epidemic," staged its own spectacles as well ( Midnight's 48). Other to the aspects symptomology of visual culture of the spectacle such as painting, Rushdie cinema, explores and in Midnighťs architecture Children contribute and to the symptomology of the spectacle Rushdie explores in Midnighťs Children and have been admirably explored elsewhere by critics such as Prem Chowdry, Neil ten Kortenaar, and Michael Trussler. Rushdie relies heavily on the photograph, however, to stage moments of resistance to the spectacle. This is due, in part, to the historical role photography has played in the batde for dominance between colonial and nationalist hegemonies, as well as the strong influence of Debord s account of spectacle on critiques of photography by Sontag and Berger that have informed Rushdie's work. It is this recovery of social reality from the distortions of the spectacle that Rushdie strives to achieve in his fiction and non-fiction, a task that he accomplishes by "replaying" and satirizing the rhetorical and visual discourses circulating within Indian society. The Taj Mahal, a widely photographed architectural icon that has served as both a revered image of national identity as well as the tourist kitsch of countless postcards and advertisements, is the subject a brief piece in Rushdie's most recent collection of essays. In encouraging his readers to continue to visit this site in person, Rushdie appears to corroborate the claims of postcolonial theorists who accuse him of market- ing India for Western consumption. Far from colluding with travel agencies, however, Rushdie exhorts his readers to refuse to allow the ubiquitous image - the "million mil- lion counterfeits" - of this building to substitute for the experience of beholding it in</page><page sequence="14">14 Mosaic 38/1 (March 2005) person. Decades after writing Midnight's Childreny Rushdie is still weaning a world full of Saleems off of their peepshows, still reminding us "that the world is real, that the sound is truer than the echo, the original more forceful than its image in the mirror" (Step 172). Rushdie points us, like Benjamin, to the aura of the original that is lost among its countless reproductions and, like Deleuze, to the icon displaced within the modern simulacrum's "triumph of the false" (Deleuze 262). This critique of the cul- ture of spectacle persists throughout Rushdie's oeuvre and is the basis of any informed reading of Midnight's Children. WORKS CITED Ahmad, Aijaz.
