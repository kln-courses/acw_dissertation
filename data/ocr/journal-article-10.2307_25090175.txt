<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alexander Wilson Art, Geography and Resistance "In every perception of nature there is actually present the whole of society." ?Theodore Adorno, Aesthetic Theory "The bush is sitting under a tree and singing." ?Ojibway song In NORTHCENTRAL Ontario, at the height of land that separates the watershed of the Great Lakes from that of Hudson Bay, lies a region named Temagami. Like a good half of Canada, it is a relatively flat and thickly wooded place, here planted with the spruces and larches of the boreal communities to the north as well as the pines and deciduous species of the St. Lawrence lowlands away to the south. The woods open frequently to out crops of ancient granite, and in the low areas lakes, rivers and bogs connect with each other and provide a way through an otherwise difficult country. Over the past 150 years, Temagami has been stripped of gold, tin and timber. Today it is a sparsely settled, depressed area dependent on a fragile tourist economy. The Teme-Augama Anishnabai call this place N'Daki Menan, Our Land.1 Since they have never signed a treaty with any of the settler governments of Canada, their tenure in Temagami has been a matter of continual negotiation, litigation and direct action, particularly given that the policy of the federal government since the early Trudeau years has been to "extinguish" aboriginal land rights wherever possible. ll should mention in passing that all our names for the first people of this continent?native, aboriginal, indian, primitive, and so on? are unsatisfactory. They imply that these are people of the past, that they are not our contemporaries. They imply the superiority of European settlers. 233</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review Litigation has meant proving long term occupancy of Temagami and the importance of a land base for their cultural survival?an exercise settler societies have never had to endure. Among many other witnesses, geologists and archeologists have presented evidence about the ancient web of traplines and trails in the region, along which they have found 6000-year-old campsites, now buried under four feet of accumulated earth. As court proceedings about Temagami have moved from one jurisdiction to another?the case is now before the Supreme Court of Canada?the Ontario government has begun extend ing a logging road into a remnant old-growth stand of white and red pine on the disputed land. These 200- and 300-year-old trees, among the oldest in Ontario, would provide less than a year's supply of lumber for a local mill. Since last summer, the Temagami Wilderness Society has joined the Teme-Augama Anishnabai in organizing a blockade of the road. People have chained themselves to the bulldozers and buried themselves up to the shoulders in the roadbed. Collisions like this?involving the resource industry, aborig inal peoples, tourism and the environmentalist movement? have become commonplace in the past decade. On Columbus Day, 1988 (a day not celebrated in Canada)^ the Lubicon band of Cree declared themselves a sovereign people and blocked access to the oil companies who have working wells on their lands in northern Alberta. The Innu people and their many supporters across the country have been arrested for blocking runways on a proposed NATO base on their traditional lands in Labrador. These three bands were among the founding members of the Alliance of North American Aboriginal Nations, an organization formed only a year ago to provide for mutual assistance in the self-defence of aboriginal lands and cultures. Clearly these struggles are not only about power, wealth and legal rights. They are struggles over the social meaning of the earth. Trails, access roads, runways, traplines and camps are more than evidence of human settlement. They are inscriptions that are derived from and in turn shape our changing ideas about the land. The difference between a trail and a road, for example, is only superficially about the difference between walking and driving, about the level of technical development of a culture. Consider Hugh Brody's descriptions of hunting 234</page><page sequence="3">Art, Geography and Resistance parties among the Beaver people in the headwaters of the Peace and Liard rivers in northeastern British Columbia. Once the hunters leave their trucks and walk into the bush to set up camp, they begin to have dreams, narratives that reveal collective knowledge of land use, forest types, and animal society. Most of the hunters dream of the animals they will kill the next morning, and mark the dream-trails that will lead to them. Strong dreamers?good hunters?dream of the place all the trails to animals converge. The source of trails is the origin of game, and it is from there that the trail to heaven leads away. Maps and roads of these kinds don't translate very well from the three-dimensional space of an oral culture to the two dimensional codes of modern cartograpy, law, or journalism. As non-natives, many of us have to strain to see and hear these distinctions. Yet the attempt is instructive. A camp buried under millennia of decomposing trees and grasses, flesh and bones, suggests another way of thinking about history?natural and social?and how to represent it. To the colonizing Europeans, the Americas were not only imaged as wild and savage. The overarching drive to dom inate, extract and enslave was mediated by the remarkable im manence of the land itself. If in early accounts the Europeans described what they saw with revealing metaphors like "rich" and "bountiful," this land so unlike their own also troubled and lured them in ways their dominant spiritual traditions hadn't prepared them for. Many accounts suggest that the presence of indigenous people who lived mutually with nature met with a deeply ambivalent reaction from the settlers, whose Judeo Christian civilization had emerged in the inhospitable semi-arid zones of West Asia. Many of these initial tensions were submerged beneath the relentless conquest, enslavement and ecological transformations of the centuries to follow. Part of that conquest has been a cul tural one. In Canada in particular, our most familiar images of the land, whether in painting, photography or advertising, have more often than not been documents of an unpeopled resource. 19th-century tourist brochures, Group of Seven paint ing, contemporary corporate and government promotional literature: all image nature as rough and pure, inanimate, 235</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review uninhabited, unexplored?and in every important way separate from and subservient to human experience. Those images of Canadian geography still predominate. Yet today, this land is a very different place than it was as recently as 25 years ago. Much of North America?city and country? has in little more than a generation become unrecognizable to its inhabitants. Orchards have been replaced by shopping malls, sacred lakes by uranium mines, canyons by reservoirs. To get a sense of what is at stake with these ruptures, it is enough to ponder the collision of two forces: on the one hand, the ongoing modern project of progress and development, symbolized by the apparently limitless extraction of the earth's resources; and on the other, the broad resistance to this project which is most succinctly posed by current aboriginal land claims. This struggle has profound cultural implications. The social movements we've built in recent decades?among women, aboriginal peoples, environmentalists, to name only the most obvious?have nurtured a new culture that is critical of the long Western history of industrialization and the domination of nature. The debates that now rage in that culture?about how to represent the land, and about the philosophical implications of ecology?suggest that for non-native cultures these last years of the twentieth century might be a moment of "second contact" with the North American continent, a moment that allows us to approach this land as a subject. Landscape is a way of seeing the world, and imagining our relationship to nature. It is something we think, do and make as a social collective. Landscape is linked historically to the development of European science in the 16th century. The task of that science (initially called "natural"), was to establish a world of fact quite apart from human value and intention. But it was not until the rise of industrial capitalism in 18th and 19th-century Europe that landscape as a cultural practice? particularly in painting?became fully developed. Referring to the work of John Ruskin, Denis Cosgrove remarks that the relations between landscape as a way of seeing and the social relations of production became an explicit object of study. At the moment when a perception of the true nature of that 236</page><page sequence="5">Art, Geography and Resistance relationship seemed possible, however, it became too broad in its implications to be contained within the landscape idea. The intellectual division of art and science and the technological innovation of photography spelled the death of landscape as it had traditionally been conceived and as a subject of central cultural concern. At this time the science of geography began to appropriate landscape as its special area of scientific con cern while in photographs and tourist viewpoints landscape took on the properties of a generalized commodity whose con nections with the means of its production were once more mystified. Traditional landscape painting is today nothing if not a mys tifying endeavour. It has been largely absent from the 20th century artistic canon, not only because it has become banalized through tourist photography, but also because in modern society (and in Modernist aesthetics) the city has been under stood as the locus of history. The contemporary ecological crisis has changed all of that, socially and aesthetically. Today it is widely recognized that industrial society is unravelling the complex ecosystems of which human communities are a part: our rivers and lakes and oceans, the air we breathe, the delicate food web?all lie in tatters. This earth is losing its resilience; it may very well be dying. For all of these reasons the question of how to represent the land has become once again important, and thoroughly political. A growing body of Canadian visual art engages a broad and critical discussion of contemporary cultural geography, and allows us to glimpse social relations anew in landscape. Its historical antecedents would include, in very different ways, the work of Peter Pitseolak, Iain Baxter, An Whitlock, Jack Shadbolt, Paterson Ewen, and the shamanic and land art of the past twenty years, [figure 1] In the confines of a journal I cannot attempt a representative survey of this new work?which comprises painting and draw ing, photography, sculpture and installation, and goes under names as various as environmental art, earthworks, and new landscape. I can, however, give a very general sense of some of the aesthetic strategies it has adopted, and why these are crucial to a cultural politics of resistance. 237</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review /', ?*m. ?

As this separation has become more pronounced (and taken on new meanings) over the past century, landscape painting has become more melancholic and nostalgic. Much recent painting, however, positions itself against that tradition by actively annotating the environment with human activity. Some of this work offers a critical r??val uation of the Canadian landscape canon, working back through the aesthetics of Modernism and Romanticism, reintroducing history to the trite pictorial views of a (white) Canadian identity, reminding us of what has happened here, of the conquest of a land that has been inhabited "since the beginning/' as its first peoples tell us. [figures 2, 3, 4, 11, 13] Still other work explicitly addresses the relation of political economy to landscape: the changes and ruptures we continue to experience in North America as agriculture gives way to tour ism, as resource extraction becomes more frantic, as capital moves from city to country and back again, finally effacing the distinction between the two. [figures 2, 5, 6, 8, 10] In capitalist society, the commodity obscures the productive activities that link human communities with natural systems. A sheet of chipboard, for example, reveals far more about the nature of a global economy than it does about forest ecology. Subverting commodity culture in this case means understanding chipboard as a cultural artifact: recontextualizing it in a way that will make visible its many transformations from sawmill debris, to weekly special at a Home Improvement Centre, to aesthetic object, [figure 7] 7 RickGorenko It's a Long Story. . . acrylic on plywood 1986</page><page sequence="9">Art, Geography and Resistance Any discussion of how to represent the land in contemporary Canada must recognize how thoroughly technologized Canadian society is. We inhabit the margins of the American empire, and American modernity (and post-modernity) satu rates our culture. Living in the time and space that we do?an urbanized society strung along the United States border, with a vast and sparsely settled hinterland?our experience of the natural world is mediated by an accumulation of agricultural, industrial, resource and transport technologies. At the same time, Canadian and especially aboriginal and Qu?b?cois cultures have always struggled to speak outside of and against the American project?to emancipate modernity from within, or to preserve what is being lost to it. Resistance (or at least ambivalence toward) the globalizing tendencies of technology is part of the cultural self-identity of most Cana dians. This ambivalence has a geographical component as well. Canadians live uneasily in the place between the technological dynamo to the south and one of its objects: the great expanse of the North. I mean North as it's used casually by most people: the High Arctic of frozen seas and tundra barrens, and the sub Arctic of vast boreal forests, shallow lakes and bogs and muskeg. The North is a crucial site for the conflict between industrial capitalist society and everything that is pitted against it. It is an ancient landscape inhabited by the ancient human cultures of the Inuit, Athapaskan and Algonkian peoples. And today it too is highly technologized, its natural features overlain with oil drilling platforms, pipelines, military communications facilities, jet airfields, NATO flight ranges, lead, uranium and tin mines, hydroelectric projects, as well as radioactive garbage dumped from space. The Canadian north is also a test range for Cruise missiles and B-l bombers which rehearse for the day they will collide with Soviet weaponry. How do we go about imagining an altogether different set of relations with this land? Surely a start is to recognize that technology and geography alike are saturated with social rela tions. As political tactics, both Luddism and conservationism are thus inadequate. Beyond that, a radical opposition to the ongoing destruction of the earth must deconstruct a tangle of the truth claims of science itself. Visual art has an important contribution to make to this task, since it can directly intervene in the images, meanings and fantasies we have of nature. 241</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review 11 - Bob Boyer A Government Blanket Policy oil on blanket 1983 A remarkable amount of the art of the past generation has addressed itself to science and its history. The resurgence of earthworks in the 1960s reminded us that art, like science, is an ancient system of understanding (and inscribing) the natural world. Recent work is perhaps more directly critical of scientific knowledge, and its drive to control and dominate. Some of this work reintroduces subjectivity to science?by working with myth or narrative, or by attributing a body to the scientific gaze. Other work critiques scientific methodology from the positon of ecology, insisting that places or phenomena cannot be scrutinized without an understanding of the relations between them. This work has contributed to the heated debate about the implications of ecology for social theory, [figures 1, 2, 3, 9, 12] Common to much of this work is a desire to make visible the relations between human cultures and the natural world in a way that does not involve separation. We give those relations material form in the working landscapes that surround our cities, yet it's hard to see them. The generation of electricity, for example, is popularly represented in completely abstract terms, as if it were magic. Invisible and inaudible?especially in the case of nuclear power generation, a process too life-threatening to be witnessed?the energy paths that flow from the earth to us and back again are as mystified as the chipboard I mentioned earlier. It is within the resource industry, in fact, that conflicts over the social aspects of science and technology are perhaps most acutely felt. The current conflict in Temagami is only one of scores right across Canada.

At stake are radically different ideas about the earth, and our own survival on it. If this culture is really to come to terms with the crisis of the land, we will need to feel ourselves once again to be part of our environment rather than neutral observers (or masters) of it.

This is an anthropomor phic gesture, something that scientific rationalism would dis miss as sentimental and subjective. Yet by endowing our environment with the qualities of the only subjects we know? ourselves?we invest it with meaning. Those meanings are as often as not laden with sexism, colonialism and species hier archy; witness the number of cars, tractors and military machines named after animals. While it is not enough simply to project human behaviors and motivations onto the natural world, anthropomorphism is a means for making that world intelligible to human society. A radical cultural practice uses anthropomorphism in another way: to break down the ideology of "humanity vs. nature"; to breach on the symbolic level the well-policed boundaries between human and non-human, [figures 3, 9, 10] Such work begins to interrogate the ways we extend our bodies and identities out into nature?by thinking of animals as human, for example, or ourselves as animals. It re-evaluates hunting, agriculture, shamanism, and medical technology as part of the history of myth, a way of imagining ourselves interacting with an earth understood to be animated and sacred, [figures 4, 12, 13] 12 Bill Vazan Glaciar Meltdown Serpent conte'and pastel -1983 246</page><page sequence="15">Art, Geography and Resistance In all our thinking about the interface of contemporary culture and environment, it is critical that we understand the aboriginal demand for a land base. It is a demand that speaks about this earth in a way dominant social forces want us to forget. By asserting traditional occupancy of land, a human blockade stretched across a road or airstrip refuses human domination. It also refuses the further domination of nature. Its linked and buried bodies insert themselves into natural history in much the same way that land art inserts itself into scientific discourse. These are acts of resistance that imagine the earth resisting. 13 Domingo Cisneros * The Two-Headed One- young deer skulls, moose and deer jaws, moose bones * 1988 247</page><page sequence="16">The Massachusetts Review READING LIST Aronowitz, Stanley.
