Applications for membership should be made either through a Fellow or direct to the Honorary Secretary, Royal Anthropological Institute, 21 Bedford Square, London, wc i, who will gladly supply full details of its activities and of the rights and obligations of Fellows. Forms of proposal, obtainable from the Institute, should, in general, be signed by a Fellow having personal knowledge of the applicant. (The Honorary Secretary may be able to provide applicants who do not know Fellows with a list of those living near them.) Fellows receive the Institute'sJOURNAL free and may subscribe to Man at 30S instead of 36s a year; they may borrow up to ten books at a time from the Library, by post if desired, for a period of one month; and, among other facilities, they may bring guests to lecture meetings, which are held fortnightly from October to June. The annual subscription of three guineas (?3 3s) becomes due on election-unless this takes place in November or December-and on the first of every January thereafter. Annual subscriptions may be compounded for at any time by payment of fifty guineas (?52 Ios), which entitles a Fellow to membership for life. The entrance fee is one guinea (Li is). Associate membership, which includes many of the advantages of Fellowship, is open to persons under the age of twenty-six, at a lower sub- scription and withdut entrance fee. THE JOURNAL A volume of the Institute's JOURNAL is issued annually, price C2, in two parts which are published in June and December. NOTES TO CONTRIBUTORS Papers should be submitted ready for the printer. Later corrections and additions can be accepted only at the discretion of the Honorary Editor. Papers are accepted on the recommendation of the Honorary Editor and the Associate Editors, which is subject to the approval of the Institute's Council. They should be sent to the Honorary Editor, Royal Anthropological Institute, 2I Bedford Square, London, wCi. Con- ditions of acceptance, waived only in exceptional instances, are that the material submitted has not already appeared in print (apart from quotations and illustrations of which the source is acknowledged), that it is not under consideration elsewhere, and that, if published, it will not be reproduced in whole or substantial part without leave of the Honorary Editor or his Deputy. Before preparing their papers, authors are urged to study the JOURNAL'S conventions, particularly in regard to the way in which authorities are cited in the text and to the style and detail required for the Reference List. Titles ofjournals and monograph series which appear in the list should be abbreviated according to the system used in the World List of Scientific Periodicals (see the JOURNAL, vol. 85) . When in doubt as to the recognized abbreviation for a Journal, it is better to write the title in full. Papers offered for publication should not normally be of less than 4,000 or more than I2,000 words. They should be typed double-space, and a carbon copy should be kept. Notes should be placed at the end, before the Reference List. Words should be underlined only to indicate italics; titles of books and Journals (but not of articles) cited in the Reference List should be underlined, and not written in capitals or placed between inverted commas. Non-European names and words should be written in roman letters, since the JOURNAL does not normally use phonetic letters. Figures and maps should be drawn in black Indian ink with lettering in soft pencil, about twice the intended final size. Photographs should never be smaller than the intended final size. Galley proofs will be sent to authors, but not normally page proofs. Since the proofs sent to authors are 'page on galley', it will not be possible to allow alterations or additions which will involve over-running. Any addition which the author considers really essential may be allowed if there is space on the last page of the article to fit it in as a postscript. Authors receive 24 free copies of offprints. Additional copies can be supplied at cost price, and authors are asked to notify the office of the Institute of the number of additional offprints they require when returning corrected galley proofs. JOURNAL SERIES For convenience of reference, all volumes of the imperial octavo series which began in I898, as well as the demy quarto series which began in 193I, and the present crown quarto series which began in I960, are numbered in continuation of the old demy octavo series. Thus, vol. I of the imperial octavo series= vol. XXVIII of the old series, and vol. XC (I960) is the sixty-third volume of the new series.</page></plain_text>
