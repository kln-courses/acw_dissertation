<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moliere's Don Juan and The Space of the Commedia dell'Arte Franco Tonelli I. Text and Content Written in the aftermath of the quarrel about Tartuffe, Moliere's Don Juan opened in Paris, at the Palays Royal, on February 16, 1665. The text was written while Moliere was preparing The Misanthrope because his company needed new material to perform. At the time, Tartuffe had been banned, The Misanthrope was not yet quite ready for the stage and the company was experiencing a period of both artistic and economic depression. Since 1658, Don Juan's legend had been playing the theatres of Paris with increasing success. Documents of the time tell us that audiences unfailingly filled the theatre to see Italian troupes performing this Spanish legend with the support of extraordinary stage machinery such as a statue riding a horse, lightning, thunder, and the burning flames of hell invading the stage of the "H6tel de Bourgogne" where they were playing.' Thus, at one level at least, Moliere's decision to write and to produce Don Juan is historically framed in a well-defined show business context: competition from a highly acclaimed success, a troublesome rapport with contemporary critics and necessity to prepare a comeback with material that could assure some success. We have no evidence at all that Moliere was acquainted with the original Spanish version, El burlador de Sevilla, written 35 years before his own (1630). Though Moliere was familiar with Spanish theatre, it appears highly unlikely that a copy of Tirso's text circulated in France by 1665. We do know, however, that he was familiar with the Commedia dell'Arte performances and that through them he became ac- quainted with the legend of Don Juan. Moliere, in other words, either saw it in per- formance, or read "scenarios" which were, as we know, notes for performing in a Franco Tonelli teaches in the Dept. of French and Italian, and in the Film Studies Program at the University of California at Irvine. He is the author of L'Esthetique de la Cruaute, Oedipus and the Tale of the Theatre, La Caduta della Sfinge. 1Moliere, Oeuvres completes, Vol. I (Paris: Garnier, 1962), p. 707. 440</page><page sequence="2">441 / DON JUAN'S SPACE specific style and with a specific perception of theatre based on the concept of im- provisation.2 The reading of Moliere's text I should like to propose here does not attempt to restore an original meaning which might have escaped the innumerable commen- tators; rather, it attempts to ask the text what are the relationships between its fic- tional strategies and the tradition of a Commedia dell'Arte performance. If such con- nection informs the text, if we can read it in the context of the tradition of a popular genre, Moliere's Don Juan provides us with a theatrical ontology which might give us as well a renewed critical reading of his dramaturgy. Moliere's text today, just as when it first appeared, continues to puzzle critics, if for no other reason than its odd structure. The play is in fact composed as a free collage of scenes that undermines any causal linking. As the action unfolds, it appears to be struggling to find a suitable "END," at any rate an end grounded on univocity of meaning. It actually ends on a flamboyant coup de theatre with the protagonist sent to burning hell by a statue, while his servant Sganarelle remains on stage screaming that he has been cheated out of his salary. Furthermore, the text is characterized by an unusual approach to language. Scene after scene, words are destabilized as conveyors of truth and/or knowledge working against the linear unfolding of the action. In short, this Don Juan is constructed as a complex metaphor of transgression, subvert- ing all possible mimetic underpinnings. Within the spectrum of French seventeenth-century dramatic writings, Don Juan is perhaps the text that most radically disregards Aristotle's theory of mimesis, then con- sidered still the principal authority. At the heart of Aristotle's mimetic theories, there resides the positing of an ideality and univocity of meaning issuing from an assumed universal status of the soul identical in all men. Through a return to a more popular, carnivalesque theatrical tradition informed by the criteria of pleasure and communal celebration, Moliere breaks open such presumed stability and stages a theatrical universe of infinitely poliferating meanings undercutting any principle of mimetic identity. He thus pits pleasure against intention or transcendental signifiers, making of theatre a utopian space where ideology finds a dissolution into spectacle and pleasure. Most readings of Moliere's text take their point of departure from this strikingly ab- normal structure and attempt to critically translate such abnormality into a disguise for a much more stable content. Consequently, Don Juan is understood - to mention 2G. de Bevotte, La Ikgende de Don Juan (Paris: Cornmly et Co., 1906), pp. 151-56. Also O. Mandel, The Theatre of Don Juan (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1963). "Just at this time [1658], the Italians were required to make room at the Petit Bourbon for Moliere's company, newly returned from a twelve-year tour of the provinces. Since the foreigners played on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays and Moliere's company on other days, there is no mystery about the manner in which Moliere became ac- quainted with the Don Juan story - if, indeed, he had not read or seen versions of it at an earlier date" (pp. 102-4). On "improvisation" see also S. Th&amp;rault, La Commedia dell'Arte vue a travers le Zibaldone de Perouse (Paris: CNRF, 1965). The improvization was most of all a technique of the trade based on an unpredictable use of passages learned by heart, uttered at the right moment as a security blanket against lack of imagination or against a sudden lack of suitable reply. The illusion of creation came more from gesture, intonation, context than from the actual content of what was said.</page><page sequence="3">442 / TI, December 1985 but a few interpretations - as the victim of a grand delusion, of a utopian notion of freedom, as an ironic portrait of Moliere himself who after the opening of Tartuffe was described by his enemies as a "heretic who must be burned in hell," as the pros- ecutor of a hypocritical society or as the great master of intellectual comedy.3 In a different key, but with the same critical preoccupation, Don Juan is seen also as a theorist of his own mythic being, as a highly complex theoretical text on speech acts, as a disruptive force subverting the social laws governing the circulation of debts, as well as a fertile ground for psychoanalytical investigation. In M. Foucault's words: "The existence of Don Juan ... subverts the two great legal systems conceived by Western culture to rule on sex: The law of alliance and the order of desires. Let us leave to psychoanalysts to determine whether he was homosexual, narcissistic or impotent."4 In spite of such a plurality of meanings, it seems clear that the cornerstone of these critical approaches remains remarkably similar inasmuch as they all aim at inscribing a meaning into a theatrical text that does not in fact seem to deliver any. Furthermore, all these critical readings succeed in assigning to the text a seemingly necessary alterity for, in last analysis, they reconstruct a variety of referential systems that the text is subsequently assumed to display. Through an archaeological critical work - archaeo- logical because it points toward unveiling origin and meaning - the ultimate message of the play is found in a space other than the theatre and, by and large, in a pre- established ideological system. Consequently, the play is understood on the basis of an assumed separation between the real and the theatrical and of a reading of the latter against the former. It strikes me, however, that this necessary archaeological work disregards the very simple fact that the text was created for professional needs and that its history shows the presumed "other" to be nothing else but the stage and a successful communication with the audience. Even a superficial look at the play unquestionably shows that the dynamics of Moliere's Don Juanism reside in the theatrical act, of seducing for the sake of entertainment, however narcissistically oriented. Furthermore, a comparative reading of Tirso's work, and of the preceding French version 5 with Moliere's makes it apparent that in the latter a considerable shift of focus has occurred whereby the religious and moral content of the story is radically translated into sheer spectacle. 3R.

The Commedia dell'Arte Don Juan's legend came to Moliere through the mediation of the Commedia dell'Arte. Benedetto Croce in his essay on the Commedia emphasizes that "commedia dell'arte" is not a primarily artistic or aesthetic concept but simply a professional one.6 Commedia dell'Arte signifies the industrialization of the theatre with the formation of professional itinerant companies who took their shows throughout Europe selling entertainment as their best product. The materials of their shows (plots, fragments) were admittedly sometimes drawn from the more serious theatre (such as the Spanish drama). These borrowings, however, were simple canvases, exterior elements and not the substance of their work. Their performances were deeply grounded on plastic figurations, on mimic, on the preponderant importance of the mask, on gestures, on acrobatics, in short, on all those elements that we call today "lazzi" (i.e., Action). The specificity of the Commedia dell'Arte resided in the shifting of the theatre's center of gravity from words to mimic and action. The spoken word became but one element among all others, often improvised, created, readapted, at any rate condi- tioned by a theatrical mode more akin to the "happenings." Thus, the specificity of the Commedia signals that the matrix of their entertainment was a blatant transgression of the dominant theatre's norms; for here it is not the text that becomes action, rather it is action that becomes text. As forms of entertainment, their performance privileged movement over linear narrative, space over temporal development. The mask, therefore, had to be the most essential prop of their performance. Besides the powerful effect produced by the mask's grotesque qualities, as a theatrical prop the mask had the basic function of providing the character with general consistency and continuity so that the actors were not only and solely themselves in a given perform- ance, but, at once, the popular Harlequin, Pulcinelle, Pantalone the Doctor, and so on. By virtue of appearing on stage masked with their traits and stories already known and told, actors and characters merged in perfect theatrical synchrony facing an audience who from these demiurgical geniuses of laughter expected no explanation, no character development, no causality but simply one more performance, for the sake of entertainment. These actors-masks were admittedly theatrical and metaphorical em- bodiments of themselves. As they belonged to the stage and not to the written text, the masks of the Commedia performed symbolically, for they replaced a bygone oral tradition and popular narrative, with their fictional content synthetically visualized and now etched primarily in space.7 As a result of a metaphorical displacement from its narrative content, the mask's theatrical value resided, by and large, in the repeti- tion of itself, in its being a metaphor of a metaphor. The meaning of the mask, therefore, could only be plural and beyond narrative because, unfailingly, these meanings were only an expression of their impact on the imaginative power of the perceiving subjects. Harlequin remained always Harlequin. But as the effect of his 6B. Croce, "Intorno alla Commedia dell'Arte," in Poesia Popolare e Poesia d'Arte (Bari: Laterza, 1946), pp. 503-14. 7On the mask's popular origin, meaning, and use during carnival celebration see P. Toschi, Le origine del Teatro Italiano (Torino: Boringhieri, 1955), particularly pp. 166-227.</page><page sequence="5">444 / TI, December 1985 stage presence kept shifting according to the context in which he was placed and the audience for whom that action was performed, theatrically, Harlequin remained a centrifugal force, proliferating meanings which were never equal to themselves and always beyond him, yet framed by the same style. The mask functioned theatrically as a highly enigmatic form sustained by an unresolved tension between sameness and diversity, symbol of a primordial theatrical space where presence is not yet discourse, where signifier and signified are inseparable, where space generates time.8 The Commedia's privileging space consequently created a multifocused theatrical structure. Instead of focusing all the interest on a single central character, following its evolution, the Commedia generated a cluster of unpredictable theatrical situations, acted out on stage by equally known masks who required of the viewer to be sensitive less to chronology and progression than to simultaneity, comparison, and to contrast. Essentially, the Commedia dell'Arte performance was structured by an unresolved tension between syntagmatic (i.e., sequential) and paradigmatic (i.e., parallel) rela- tionships opening up a different mode of theatrical reading. Lastly, the Commedia dell'Arte was an enterprise conceived, by companies and audience alike, as entertainment. Those companies were in the business of producing spectacles and conversely in the strongest position to determine their forms. Because of the Commedia's commercial nature, companies needed success and their success depended upon effectively delivering the illusion of a more pleasurable world, at any rate of a world other than the one lived in, which more often than not was the target of puns and of laughter. In short, through comic means, the product they were pro- posing to their audiences was the enjoyment of such utopian feelings as escape and wish fulfillment. A product that manipulated audiences' sensibility to make them feel utopia rather than making them contemplate utopian models. Furthermore, the illu- sion of escape had to be based on countercultural impulses in order to sustain the illusion of breaking away from contemporary cultural and historical oppressing deter- minations.9 III. Don Juan and the Mask When we consider the Commedia's mode of being, it appears clear that the media- tion of the Italian professional entertainers brought to Moliere not so much the legend 8 About Harlequin and his origin see P. Toschi, ibid., pp. 196-208. On the relationship between mask and spectator, the comment made by L. Riccoboni in his Histoire du th'atre Italien (Paris, 1720 [circa]) as quoted by P. Toschi, ibid., is particularly significant: "la premiere chose que le peuple demande gne'ral- ment c'est de savoir si l'Arlequin est agile, s'il fait des culbutes, s'il danse." Riccoboni describes also the theatrical function of the "lazzi," performed by the mask. In Volume I of the Histoire he writes: "L'im- promptu donne lieu a la variete du jeu, ensorte que revoiant plusieurs fois le meme Canevas on peut revoir chaque fois une piece diff&amp;rente" (p. 61). Riccoboni later speaks of a very ancient Canevas called "Harlequin house burglar" in which while Scapin dialogues with Flaminia, Harlequin simultaneously breaks into all sorts of "lazzi," and he adds: "ces Lazzi .... quoi qu'absolument inutiles ne s'dloignent point de l'intention de la scene, car s'ils la coupent plusieurs fois, ils la renouent par la meme badinerie, qui est tir&amp;e du fond de l'intention de la schne" (p. 68). 9See F. Taviani, La Commedia dell'Arte e la Societa% Barocca, La Fascinazione del teatro (Roma: Bulzoni, 1969). ". .. La commedia dei comici di professione appare fuori posto nella citta anche perche contravviene al programma delle Arti tese almeno teoricamente-fra il delectare e il docere" (p. lxvi) and</page><page sequence="6">445 / DON JUAN'S SPACE of Don Juan as a fashionable story, but rather Don Juan as a mode of theatrical representation, as a metaphor of the very medium from which it sprang, namely the stage. The Don is first of all an entertainer. His central impulse is unquestionably escape and wish fulfillment. Even at a simple thematic level, Moliere's adaptation can be read as an interchange between these two complementary movements. The action begins in medias res, with the Don running away from the place of his last adventure (Naples perhaps) and moving on without a well-defined direction. We are never allowed to know with any degree of precision his past (only the most recent misdeed); he never speaks of his future. His escape is textually atemporal because neither does he know time nor is the audience allowed to situate him temporally. What we do know and see is that he is caught in a kind of no-man's land, a sort of limbo - the stage - from which, in the last anaylsis, he cannot escape yet derives the substance of his perennial theatrical present.'0 His final disappearance from the stage is a symbolic transfer from a given space to a larger one, burning hell, brought about by a blatant theatrical prop: a statue. While the statue pronounces what appears to be the moral indictment of Don Juan: "Obstinacy in sin brings on a sinister Death; and Heaven's mercy rejected opens the way for its Thunder,"" the very fact that such a pronouncement is made by a purely theatrical entity creates a calculated tension between verbal and visual representation, weakening meaningful words with the interference of the fantastic and recycling language itself into the theatrical world of entertainment. The exit of Don Juan does not lead outward into the wings (left to right as it were) to create the illusion of time passage, but rather occurs vertically. As Moliere tells us: "Thunder and Lightning, with a great noise / Fall upon Don Juan, the Earth opens / and swallows him up and Great Flames / Rise from the Place he sunk into" (p. 776). He never leaves the stage, he simply moves from one set to a more flamboyant one, with a downward spiral movement within a spectacular, illusion-making machine. Thus, by means of theatre, the concept of "escape" is here semantically and otherwise destabilized to become a theatrical signifier that bears no relation to any other reality but itself. From the very beginning, the Don is characterized, or so it appears, by a high degree of mobility. But in his case, movement does not imply change, it rather implies repetition. The more it moves, the more his character repeats itself. If at a sequential or syntagmatical level a story is seemingly told of a seducer on the run who will even- tually be caught, then, this story is simultaneously undercut by a parallel or paradigmatic movement of repetition that forces the reader/viewer to understand the later Taviani adds: "Gli elementi sensuali ed osceni che comparivano negli spettacoli dell'arte non erano sentiti come rappresentazione di una realta umana ricca di umori terreni . . . ma come rappresentazione di ci6 che nel mondo appariva fallace e alienante, effimero e mascherato, invito a dimenticare opere e giorni, 'maleficio sonnifero' dove il sonno, secondo il dire di Tertulliano, 4 inteso non piui come riposo, ma come una dissimulatio praesentiae" (p. lxvii). 10 A.

The translation is mine.</page><page sequence="7">446 / TI, December 1985 action not causally - for nothing ever changes - but by comparison and by juxtaposi- tion. In the case of the final scene just mentioned, the moral indictment and punish- ment as the denouement of the story can only be perceived and understood in com- parison to what actually occurs on stage. Seemingly final, the change is not a true change being framed, as it is, and for no causal reasons, within the same space (his home, his stage). It should be remembered that the preceding scene has prepared us for the exit of Don Juan who had promised to join the statue at another place. But then, not knowing where to go, he childishly gives his hand to the statue asking to be led away. And the statue sinks him. As an end, Don Juan and the prop/statue have here performed together another theatrical stunt, another "lazzo" for the pleasure of an audience caught now between amazement and laughter. At any rate, the overriding concern of spectacle generates for the audience such exhilaration and disbelief that not only Don Juan is sunk into hell but so is all the moral and transcendental meaning such a finale could possibly have. This finds confirmation in the short scene following Don Juan's sinking. Sganarelle facing the audience, while smoke and flames serve him as backdrop, cries: "My wages! My wages! There you have it. By his death everybody is satisfied. Offended heaven, violated laws, seduced women, dishonored families, abused parents. Wives reduced to misery, husbands to desperation, everybody is happy, I alone am miserable. After so many years of service, I have no other reward than to see my master receive the most terrific punishment in the world. My wages! My wages!" 12 (p. 776). In this final speech there are clearly two movements. On the one hand, Sganarelle separates himself from the fictional weaving of the story and contrasts his presence with the sequential order of what has been presented, listing all those fic- tional entities who now as a result of the action should be happy. On the other hand, he seeks the complicity of the audience to contrast the world of victims, punitive flames and talking statues with his own: the fictional world of a traditional mask (the servant) whose endless picaresque inventiveness is constantly motivated by the lure of money. As a mask, what Sganarelle is telling the audience is that the Statue's im- promptus cheated him out of his traditional script. No matter how terrific the wit- nessed punishment appears to be, to him it is not the right reward, consequently this end cannot be the right one. Hence, he does not accept it and runs off after the unknown claiming furiously his wages, searching for a more suitable scenario. Has Don Juan played on him one more of his tricks? Has he escaped for good, or will Sganarelle run into him again somewhere? We will never know the answer and perhaps, at this juncture, it is not important to know it. What has happened in the meantime is that theatrical fiction and its messages have been twice theatricalized (it clearly is here a case of theatre within the theatre) by paralleling two focal points on the same story, thus blurring clarity of meaning for the sake of entertainment but with the complicity of the audience, who at the end is directly asked to identify with Sganarelle and not with the spectacle behind him. The complementary movement to escape is wish fulfillment. There is perhaps no 12 This scene is already present in the scenarios of the Commedia. See 6. Macchia, Vita, Avventura e Morte di Don Giovanni (Torino: Einaudi, 1978), p. 7.</page><page sequence="8">447 / DON JUAN'S SPACE other character in the history of dramatic literature whose motivation is so unques- tionably denounced as pure sexual wish fulfillment. As he explains to Sganarelle in the first act: What! Would you have me faithful to the first object that takes me, to renounce the world for that and have no more eyes for anybody? A fine thing indeed to parade this false Honour of being faithful . . . and to be dead from one's very youth to all other Beauties that may strike our eyes ... For me, beauty ravishes me wherever I see it, and I easily give in to the sweet Violence with which I am overpowered ... I cannot refuse my heart to any pleasing object I see, and when a handsome face demands it of me, if I had ten thousand, I would give them all. [p. 719] Yet, while he boldly states to both servant and audience his creed, his rhetoric betrays him. What in fact surfaces from this first monologue is the image of a seducer who is con- stantly looking around himself and who straddles between being an active and a passive agent. For him, to take is to be taken, is tantamount to being ravished by sweet violence and to give himself endlessly, promiscuously, undiscriminately to whoever calls on him. The parallel use of the I/eye of the speaker, merging Subject and means, sketches a highly self-reflexive and mobile portrait where the activity of scanning is privileged over the inner qualities of the observing subject. The seducer is none other than a subject seduced by his own quest for one and all Beauties, seduced by his own action, by a potential fictional content that paradoxically is always to come. If anything characterizes, in Moliere's text, the protagonist's action, it is the fact that despite his rhetoric, sex is systematically removed from his world as though theatrical presence denied what is otherwise claimed. The personage is constantly self- defined by a paradoxical split that separates theatricality, gestures, from fictional con- tent. As a known legend, Don Juan repeats here what he is expected to be and do, repeats the outer traits of his already constituted mask, but the text or stories that should give it full narrative content are displaced, always ahead of him and, probably, beyond his abilities of performance. Not accidentally his monologue ends with this statement: "My heart wants to love the whole Earth; and like Alexander, I wish for new worlds where I could perform my amorous conquest" (p. 720). We are at the beginning of Act I, Scene II, when little has yet happened in terms of action, when Don Juan has not yet acted out any of his plans. His rhetoric already speaks of new spaces, as if to signal ironically the inadequacy of the present text to contain a fiction that in fact cannot be simply grounded in narrative terms. With a destabilizing rhetoric of utopian anticipation, the protagonist tells here the nucleus of his own legend, but a legend that, from the narrator's point of view, can only look inward and repeat endlessly the ongoing gesture of desire (objectified in the movement of the eyes), detemporalized and uprooted from any reality, for such fan- tasizing of the lover's self has no object on which to focus. His exposition, in other words, tells Don Juan's tale but the tale that is told tells of the impossibility of such a project. As a fictional character, he can only perceive that which is in the world of the story, but, here, that world is blocked out of sight by his own gestures, his own acting mask,</page><page sequence="9">448 / TI, December 1985 that is by a representation of a representation of himself. Thus, as a first-person nar- rative voice attempting to unveil and display the self, what he can perceive is but the icon of a disappeared content, and the future worlds contemplated are rhetorical substitutes for a vanished origin. Existing only upon the death of both narrator and narrative voice, having been already transformed into an agent of sheer entertainment incapable of meaningfully linking memory and representation, of giving adequate ex- pression to the inherent idealism of his unsatisfiable desire, he theatrically transforms time or the mode of temporality into space for improvisations. The rest of the text is in fact grounded on a system of improvisations whereby scenes are juxtaposed - irrespective of causality - to provide the protagonist with a context against which to react. In so doing, he not only thematically transgresses all established norms, but also textually moves to erase any situation that would lead into narrative continuity. Toward the end of Scene II, Sganarelle, to no avail, attempts to jolt him out of his absurd behavior and to bring him back to a more reasonable one: Sganarelle: Learn from me, your servant, that Heaven sooner or later punishes the im- pious, that a wicked Life leads to a wicked Death, that ... Don Juan: Peace! Sganarelle: What is the matter? Don Juan: The matter is that a Beauty has taken my Heart and that swept off by her charms I have followed her, here, to this City. [p. 721] Deaf to the warnings of Heaven, oblivious that he has just murdered the Com- mandeur, his only reply is that, presently, he finds himself seduced again by a new Beauty. Thus, he proceeds to devise a strategy to kidnap her and take her away on a boat. As for Sganarelle, realizing that to speak of punishment and reward is a mean- ingless endeavor: "Good for you; there's nothing like contenting oneself." Don Juan replies: "Then be ready to go along with me" (p. 722). They don't go anywhere. Unexpectedly, Elvira appears and her entrance delays the new plot, preventing the audience from seeing in action the hero's amorous deeds. Only later (Act II, Scene I), will we learn that the boat unfortunately sank (sinking indeed seems to be the only actual movement of this hero), and that nothing came out of his highly dramatic seducing tactics. Rescued by peasants who happened to be on the beach at that time, he is brought back to land, dripping, half dead, and promptly forgets what has just occurred. He then proceeds to seduce - we will see how - two peasant girls who accidentally happen to pass by. If the text, so far, has shown a progressive movement of fragmentation, it simultaneously shows a movement of accumulation of incidents that are in tension with any form of textual unity. We might begin to suspect that the polarity of seducer/seduced, I/eye, active/passive, past/future displayed in the first monologue is rhetorically and theatrically operative as a metaphorical construct that renders visi- ble an irreducible split between Action and Text, between MASK and linear fictional content. But then, at the very opening of Act I, the entrance of Don Juan already had been prepared in a Commedia dell'Arte-like fashion. Sganarelle and Gusman (Elvira's valet)</page><page sequence="10">449 / DON JUAN'S SPACE walk on stage in the midst of a conversation they are having about tobacco and its entertainment qualities: "In spite of what Aristotle says ... there is nothing like tobacco. ... Don't you see that as soon as one takes it, with what obliging manner one relates to everybody, and how glad one is to give it left and right, no matter where one is?" (p. 715). Though there is little, if any, relationship between what Sganarelle says here and the action to come the entertaining quality of tobacco stated here in a presumed anti-Aristotelian mode, operates at another level. While it provides the overture with a continuity between the outer and the inner world of the play so as to bring onto the stage through the wings a sense of contem- porary social reality, such continuity is expressed strictly metaphorically. The To- bacco image stresses the activity of a social community that revolves around pleasure and entertainment, however ephemeral they may be. Thus, at the outset, it establishes for the text a referential system rooted in a given social reality but a reality posited already as a theatrical world based on attitudes and gestures, seen as we would see it drawn in a caricature, or from the perspective of silhouettes against beams of light. Such social interaction is informed by no other morality than that of being an honest man in a community devoted to pleasure and to mutual gratification. Hence the great mobility and disponsibility of "tobacco" becomes quickly a comic symbol of entertain- ment, for the sake of a troubleless and happy community. No different, however, is Don Juan's heart ready to be given on all sides, be he where he will. The ephemeral, theatrical mode of being of his "heart" - stated in the immediately following scene - shows a striking parallelism with that of "tobacco" described by Sganarelle, thus foreshadowing an analogical reading of Don Juan's "heart" as the icon for the pleasurable forthcoming theatrical interlude devoted to the community gathered around him. Sganarelle continues then: "But let's resume the thread of our Discourse." The thread is resumed by sketching a portrait of Don Juan: "Just between us, I tell you that you see in Don Juan, my master, the greatest scoundrel the earth has ever seen, a mad- man, a dog, a Devil, a heretic ... one of Epicurus' swine, a true Sardanapulus who esteems all we believe as nonsense. You tell me he has married your Mistress; believe me, he would have done much more for his Passion, and with her he would have mar- ried also you, her Cat and her Dog" (pp. 716-17). Besides being presented as an im- probable character whose sexual passion knows no boundaries, whose whorish prom- iscuity and availability is barely legitimized by his overt abuse of the institution of marriage, whose fictional and irrational existence follows a witch-like course midway between earth and hell, the entire monologue of Sganarelle is marked by a pleonastic rhetoric of accumulation that somehow fails to sketch a fully developed portrait or to give to the portrait sufficient depth. The rhetorical expansion he attempts proves to be here somewhat reductive as to point to an actual impossibility of producing meaning out of this character. At any rate, there is a clear impossibility to read beyond ap- pearances and to go from them to their motivations with the result that Sganarelle unveils not Don Juan's true face but merely successive layers of masks as in a car- nivalesque carousel.13 The more the words attempt truthfully to represent reality, the 13 My reading is quite similar to A. Simon's. Simon sees Don Juan as a character whose mask is forever attached to his face. To try to remove the mask would result in uncovering what Rilke calls the non-face.</page><page sequence="11">450 / TI, December 1985 more they superimpose a symbol on another symbol, displaying not meaning but a mirror-like system of images that ultimately undermines reality yet reinforces legend- ary and popular beliefs. Sganarelle's compounding rhetorical effect cuts out a seman- tic field in which Don Juan is designated as a composit image of bodily pleasure, folly, and otherworldly powers. Such introduction constitutes a rather drastic shift from the text that preceded Moliere's own. In Tirso de Molina, Don Juan is on stage at the very opening of the play, thus by definition positioning all statements made by his servant Catalin6n as commentaries on the action of the protagonist, but after the fact. As for the French and Italian versions, they feature no such portrayal. This introduction, focusing on layers of effigies and on multiplicity of meanings, appears to be Moliere's own crea- tion, possibly inspired by what he had seen in the Commedia dell'Arte performances. 14 Interestingly enough, in the Dictionnaire Etymologique, first published in 1650 (Moliere's Don Juan dates February 1665), a work that Moliere must have known, the author, M nage, sees "le masque" as first of all an artificial face, an additional face (from the Spanish mas-cara) but following its Latin equivalent LARVA, it also designates a spectre, a ghost. Furthermore, according to an ancient Lombard legal text, the term mask designates also a witch. Menage reminds us also of a fourth meaning: "We call mask also a whore. ... in ancient Greece, brothels were located outside the city and women prostituting themselves wore a mask so that men sleeping with them would not recognize them. . . . today, apparently, we call whores 'mask' because of the extremely heavy make up used and we can say that they are masked." "5 False face, spectre, witch, 14 Among the scenarios of the Commedia dell'Arte left to us, there are several on the legend of Don Juan. Le festin de Pierre and La Suite du festin, transcribed from the Italian texts of the famous Harlequin, Domenico Biancolelli, are kept at the Bibliothique de l'Opera and at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. In it we read: "Dans la premiere scene j'arrive avec le roy qui me parle du libertinage de Don Juan. Je luy dis: 'Il faut, Sire, avoir patience; quand les jeunes gens deviennent un peu plus agez, ils changent de con- duite; il faut esperer que cela arrivera a Dom Jouan' . . . . Cette scene est de nuit. J'arrive seul et je m en- tretiens de la debauche de mon maistre qui ne songe qu'i deshonnorer les femmes ou filles qu'il trouve sous sa main etc." G. Macchia, p. 155; see also pp. 3-14. We don't know the year in which Biancolelli per- formed this scenario in Paris, but his performance certainly preceded Moliere's Don Juan. The theatrical mode of compounding effects is present in all scenarios of the Commedia. In L'Ateista fulminato which dates between 1600 and 1650, Don Juan has another name: Count Aurelio. At the opening of Act I he is introduced this way: "Re, Consiglieri, Corte [Re] sopra le sue disgrazie d'aver la regina moglie indisposta, e non aver speranza piui d'aver figli da lei, per la successione del Regno. Consiglieri lo consolano In questo Duca Mario essagera dell'insulto ricevuto dal Conte Aurelio, quale gli rubb6 la sorella Leonora dal serraglio delle vestali, e che ora di nuovo in campagna fa mille insulti al Regno ...." G. Macchia, p. 121. The schematization of the scenario shows how the performance aimed at surprising, at disorienting the au- dience rather than explaining events. 15 In "Le masque entre Carnaval et Commedia dell'Arte," Bouffonneries 1 (February 1980), 607. On the semantic field of MASK, see also P. Toschi.</page><page sequence="12">451 / DON JUAN'S SPACE whore, these seem to be the horizons of the semantic field of the term mask, horizons obviously already traced in the sixteenth century. Whether or not Moliere knew Menage's work, such semantic itinerary offers, however, a strong hypothesis about the dispersion, the perception, and the integration of the mask into the world of theatre fostered by the traveling performers of the Commedia dell'Arte who doubtless capitalized, for their popular art, also on the extraordinary semantic mobility of the word itself. By the same token, we can legitimately think of an elaboration of theatrical per- sonages, done by several generations of professional entertainers, who transformed their basic device, "the mask," and its meaning into a "type" that could serve as metaphorical embodiment of their trade, while remaining sufficiently open to a vari- ety of interpretations.16 This could very well be the case of Don Juan, as Moliere prob- ably saw it in performance. There is, at any rate, an unquestionable parallelism be- tween the variable semantic field of the word MASK and the characterization given to Don Juan in the opening of the play." We should remember that an Italian company led by the actor Scaramouche - in life Tiberio Fiorelli - played in Paris in 1639, 1640, and 1645, at the Petit Bourbon, with a Don Juan scenario in their repertory. The com- pany left Paris at the beginning of 1648 and in 1653 came back to the Petit Bourbon where they played again their scenario "I1 convitato di Pietra" or Don Juan. As Gendarme de Bevotte writes in his exhaustive study on the legend of Don Juan: "The Arlequinade of the Italian companies .. . attracted for a long time audiences at the Petit Bourbon and it is thanks to them that the fable of Don Juan was disseminated in France. Without their performance, probably the play would have remained in Italy, it would have been forgotten and most likely Moliere would have never known it." 18 The role played by the Commedia dell'Arte in the theatrical future of Don Juan seems crucial, not so much because it provided the legend with a new or different meaning, but because the adaptation of the original Spanish text by the Commedia dell'Arte signifies the passage of one theatrical system into a totally different one. Not only did such a different system de-emphasize the words in favor of action, but under the guise of creativity and improvisation, the Commedia dell'Arte had in fact rigorous formal laws that aimed at maximizing the importance of theatrical space. As Jean Rousset perceptively recognizes in The Myth of Don Juan: 16 This suggestive hypothesis is made by D. Febre, ibid., p. 9. 17 MASK &lt; - - -- - DON JUAN SPECTRE DEVIL WITCH HERETIC WHORE EPICURUS'S SWINE (or pleasure at the lowest level). A close reading of this passage shows that Sganarelle's list of epithets begins with "scoundrel" (in French Sc61erat), a person capable of crimes. It proceeds to expose this criminal attitude by listing a variety of ef- figies which point more to Don Juan's mode of appearing than to actual criminal deeds. The list ends with the epithet "Sardanapalus," a legendary king who burned himself and his court after having been besieged by his enemies, but whose identity remains a complete mystery. Thus, Sganarelle's catalogue foreshadows, through popular and legendary images the end of Don Juan in burning flames. Yet, such burning is not foreshadowed as a causal process but as an end built-in in the multiple appearances of such enigmatic, masked, theatrical character. 18 G. de Bevotte, p. 130.</page><page sequence="13">452 / T, December 1985 ... The written comedy, transformed and deformed by its passage through the stereotypes of a popular and semi-oral subgenre, will come back to the written text altered yet renewed. We are in the presence of an historical paradox: It was necessary that the myth - through a translation into a form that was not its own - be deformed and made into a parody in order to live and to propagate. Without the masks and the gags of the Commedia dell'Arte, the adventures of Don Juan would not have come to Moliere, to Shadwell, to Goldoni ... to Mozart.19 [pp. 107-8] Such renewal is clearly exemplified, in my view, by Moliere's text. Already in the expository segment, the text pits the mask against causal representation. Opening up a cleavage between acts and intentions, the text reinscribes within itself a new space. A utopian space of entertainment which is informed by a sustained interchange between two major themes: escape and wish fulfillment. These themes are theatrically operative by functioning at once as both text and context of the protagonist, who enters the stage already preceded by his own mask to which he will fit himself, in order to give it a live performance. The introduction given to Don Juan recalls, on a textual level, the famous entrance of the Commedia dell'Arte traditional mask, "il Dot- tore," who appeared on stage only after the first half of the long and voluminous hat he wore had entered the stage. Similarly, Don Juan enters, preceded by an accumula- tion of rhetorical effects which are larger than his own stage presence. Like the hat of the "Dottore," rhetoric here operates as a powerful theatrical prop for immediate au- dience consumption and not mimetically to ground its object. Furthermore, by under- mining the lover's potency and aggression, by eliminating any fixed, tangible object for the protagonist's desires, Moliere lures his audience to experience theatrical enter- tainment as a brief journey into the other side of the real, where laughter generates pleasure for its own sake. Thematized as "libertinage" the problem of dramatic representation then becomes Moliere's playful means of suggesting an indissoluble link between the sexual and dramatic, an inevitable crossing between sexual and representational desires. Moliere rewrites the legend of Don Juan "in pleasure," as Roland Barthes would have it. But the writing in and with pleasure has in turn a very specific status: "Does the writing in pleasure guarantee for me, the writer, the pleasure of my reader? Not at all. I must look for the reader (I must dredge him up) without knowing where he is. A space for pleasure is thus created. It's not the 'other' who is then necessary, rather it's the space: the possibility of a dialectic of desire, of unwary pleasure: . . . Let there be an ongoing play." 20 IV. Text, Language and the Mask The first act ends with the unexpected arrival of Elvira, the lady whom Don Juan has most recently betrayed. She was in a convent and fell victim to the hero's seduc- tion. Much to her dismay, she now finds herself in a discomforting limbo, having left 19 J. Rousset, II mito di Don Giovanni (Parma: Pratiche Editrice, 1980), pp. 108-9. On the "Commedia" and on Don Juan see also E. Kern, The Absolute Comic (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980), pp. 174-77, 200-204. 20R. Barthes, Le Plaisir du Texte (Paris: Seuil, 1973), p. 11 (my translation).</page><page sequence="14">453 / DON JUAN'S SPACE the convent for the sake of an unrealized marriage, thus bereft of both religious and civil status. Textually, her present limbo is due to having been deprived of an established context - moral or social - in which, as a fictional character, she could causally and mimetically relate. As she is forced now to move in a space of improvisation - i.e., the unpredictable world of Don Juan - she suddenly finds herself not only out of context but also, as a theatrical character, without a text. At any rate, the theatrical mode of representation that she embodies is in direct clash with the one embodied by her present antagonist. Confronting him in a completely foreign space (where does the first act take place anyway? In what city? Sicily maybe? But then why Sicily?), she addresses him in a language that directly reflects the world she comes from, yet a language unknown to Don Juan who can at best re-utter it without conviction as in a mime, caricature- oriented performance. Critics consider Elvira's character the most dramatic of the text. Her scenes are seen as segments in which serious drama invades the world of comedy, thus casting on Don Juan the threat of a moral judgment which he in turn defies. A closer look at this im- portant scene yields, however, a somewhat different reading, for the seriousness of Elvira is rife with contradictions and uttered in a rhetoric that undermines the character's assumed stance. Elvira: I marvel at my simplicity and the Weakness of my Heart to doubt a Treason which so many Appearances had confirmed to me. I confess I was very good, or rather very foolish, to try to deceive myself and contradict my Eyes and Judgment. .... I searched for Reasons to excuse to my Tenderness the betrayal of Friendship it perceived in you and I forged a hundred lawful causes for so hasty a Departure. .... I listened with Pleasure to a hundred ridiculous Chimeras which would tell to my Heart your Innocence .... Please, Don Juan speak, and let's see how you can justify yourself. [p. 7231 Echoing ironically the rhetorical mode of Don Juan's preceding monologue, Elvira undergoes here a process of self-analysis in which she clearly reveals the representa- tional mode she textually embodies. As in the case of Don Juan, her speech is uttered in first person. Her narrative moment is thus a highly reflexive one in which the nar- rator "I" speculates on the narrative "myself." Yet, what is revealed in this speculation is that Elvira has created a theatrical scenario in her head where the "I" is split in two characters narrating the same story - Don Juan's escape - from two different points of view: one that speaks of departure as a sign of deception and another that speaks of innocence and of legitimate causes. This mise-en-scene of a dual self has a clearly defined finality: to search for reasons, to excuse. That is to transform and then restore Don Juan to her world and to make him function as a readable text within which she might find her own character. In other words, fashioned into a necessary other, Don Juan is construed as a referential system - however idealized - that undercuts Elvira's first-person utterance, for inevitably it breaks the I- myself focus into I =you= myself. To be coherent with the theatrical world of Don Juanism, Elvira's reflexive moment is not reflexive enough, for it is flawed by the need for another text. Bringing these two characters face to face at the end of the first act, therefore, amounts to jux- taposing in the same space two different theatrical systems, two different modes of</page><page sequence="15">454 / TI, December 1985 representation. Essentially, Elvira misreads Don Juan as a theatrical entity whose stage presence derives from and mirrors back a clearly readable world. By applying to him her own code, she attempts to translate him reductively into linear narrative content and thus ends by misreading her hero. Don Juan does not answer but symbolically turns to Sganarelle - to the world of Commedia - and commands him to reply. And reply he does, by repeating a rather transparent truth, yet one meaningless to Elvira: "Madame, the Conquerors, Alexander and the New / Worlds, caused our Departure. / This is all I can say, Sir" (p. 724). Based on a manifest lack of communication, this scene stages also two different con- cepts of theatrical language. One (Elvira's) that sees it as a mediation system of sym- bols directly related to the outer world thus constituting dialogue as a sequence of messages linked by chronological development, the other (Don Juan and Sganarelle's) more theatrical and self-reflexive in which the uttered reply doubles itself with a hid- den one shifting the focus to different realities than the one in question. At any rate, the latter is a theatrical language that sees the exchanges in the dialogue as having multiple orientations and functions, as well as radiating at once multiple meanings.21 In the case of Sganarelle's reply, which gives Elvira nothing but Don Juan's theatrical- ity, while transgressing the presumed linearity of her discourse, it functions as a pleonastic iteration of what we already know of this mask-like character, yet such pleonasm clearly positions Elvira, in the eyes of the viewer, outside Don Juan's world. Elvira needs a text that neither Don Juan nor Sganarelle are willing or able to deliver. She proceeds then to create one for them: "Why don't you tell me - that you still love me - and that nothing will keep you from me but Death. . . . Why don't you tell me that Affairs of the utmost Consequence obliged you to depart without my knowledge?" (p. 726). Obviously Don Juan cannot tell her that, because to provide such an explanation - however hypocritical - would by definition imply the psychological depth and complexity that he cannot have. It would further imply the creation of a specific kind of dramatic situation that would divert the protagonist from the theatrical world in which he is grounded.22 It would ultimately imply the writing of Elvira's play: "I must confess, Madam, I have not the talent of dissimulation and wear a sincere heart," (p. 725) replies Don Juan who will tell her instead of his realiza- tion that to oppose Heaven's will and to violate her religious life would have been too great a burden. "Would you oppose so holy a Design Madam?" (p. 725) he asks her. Furious, Elvira leaves but not without warning him first of heaven's revenge, and then, as an afterthought: "If Heaven has nothing in it that terrifies you, be at least afraid of an offended woman" (p. 726). By returning to Elvira, the very same language she used but uttered from a different perspective, Don Juan destabilizes any presumed transcendental meaning of signs such as Heaven, Conscience, Reason, and thus uses 21 M. Bakhtin, Problhmes de la pobtique de Dostoievsky (Lausanne: L'Age D'Homme, 1970). As E. Kern correctly points out - ibid., p. 8 - Bakhtine's work cannot but influence our reading and under- standing of Moliere's character. 221 am using the term dramatic situation in its general sense as analyzed by E. Souriau, Les 200,000 situations dramatiques (Paris: Flammarion, 1970).</page><page sequence="16">455 / DON JUAN'S SPACE them for his own pragmatic purposes. He redistributes these signs within his own con- text, asserting ironically his rootings in a non-metaphysical, non-transcendental world. In the end, he eliminates from such world any spurious element that would en- danger his purely theatrical and entertaining being. Elvira's discourse has had a spec- tacular boomerang effect. Counting on a presumed stability of the meaning of signs she moved to occupy and reinterpret the world of Don Juan. He, in turn, uses signs and their meanings as always dependent on an interpreter and on the contextual con- tingencies of their reading which are not determined a priori, at any rate certainly not predetermined from the perspective of the Commedia dell'Arte performer. The result is that, while Don Juan's world is brought into a sharper focus, Elvira finds herself without a part to play in it. Hence, she exits. As the second act opens, such subversive use of language as a conveyer of truth and/or knowledge continues. Don Juan has been saved from drowning. On the beach, he is surrounded by Charlotte and Pierrot, soon to be married. Following an interlude in which these two characters play a typical Commedia's scene of lovers' quarrel in their peasant dialect, Don Juan proceeds to seduce Charlotte. He carefully looks at her and then exclaims: "What should such a one as you be wife to a Peasant! No, no, That's Profanation of so much Beauty. ... Heaven which knows it well, brought me hither on purpose... to do justice to your charms . . ." (p. 733). To which Charlotte, increasingly confused, replies: "I don't know what to do ... your words make me glad and I should be mighty desirous to believe you," (p. 737) and Don Juan: ". . . I confess, I would pierce my Heart with a thousand wounds, if I had the least thought of betraying you." Charlotte, still hesitant but totally exhilarated by the feeling of intensity expressed in Don Juan's rhetoric, can no longer resist the pleasure she derives from it: "Lord, I can't tell whether what you say is true or not, but you make a Person believe you" (p. 733). As in the scene with Elvira, the linguistic ex- change functions on two different and contradictory registers. For Charlotte, language is expected to be a transparent representation of truth. For Don Juan, on the contrary, language functions as pure performance, as a speech act in perfect keeping with his order of truth. With his rhetoric, he ultimately creates a linguistic space over which he has absolute control but from which true communication is, by definition, left out.23 In its stead, space is filled with feelings of intensity, of energy, of overflowing rhetorical abundance, of plenitude generated by a theatrical character whose dynamism is grounded on a sustained tension between what is said and how it is said. What is said is nothing else but a chain of blatantly cheap lies, yet they are masked by a tremendously energetic rhetorical machine that focuses on a controlled interplay be- tween plenitude and void, between presence and absence. Such interplay is not aimed solely to seduce Charlotte, for he will do nothing of the sort. A messenger will arrive unexpectedly to tell him that he had better move on, and fast, because some mysterious men are after him. More importantly, it is aimed to entertain us, the audience, and thus to position the viewer within the created space as a recipient of this form of entertainment, rather than of some ultimate message demonstrated by the action, for the action here is purely conventional. 23 See S. Felman, pp. 37-41.</page><page sequence="17">456 / T, December 1985 V. The Audience How is the audience, then, positioned? At first, following a long-standing comedic tradition, the audience is positioned outside the performance - on the other side of the proscenium - observing both the already known part of Don Juan, and the conven- tion of Charlotte as naive victim, doomed to fall in the trap. The laughter on the part of the audience, at what is being seen, is the effect of a calculated strategy that ultimately confirms the viewers in their stable and somewhat superior position of un- problematical readers of signs and meanings. While it is the effect of a complicity that the text establishes from the author's point of view whose message is: "I, author/You, viewer, share an omniscient position," it also posits such distance as an aesthetic one. By positioning the beholder outside, the theatrical text is also construed as a self- contained object with a narrative enclosure that by definition remains at all times in- tact. Though the narrative is known and predictable, the beholder's attitude vis-a-vis the work is that of looking from afar at an object, however familiar, from which to derive endless pleasure. The textual mechanisms of the classical comedy that give the audience a seemingly privileged position, in essence, privilege the text as an artistic monologue to be listened to and contemplated in admiration as it unfolds on stage. Such is our position as this second act begins. However, as Don Juan proceeds in his amorous deeds, the presumed narrative enclosure begins to break down. The servant Sganarelle, who thus far has functioned as a mediator between stage and audience, speaking out loud the viewer's foreseeable reactions to Don Juan's behavior, suddenly gets into a spot of trouble. Pierrot, Charlotte's groom to be, does not take kindly to the advances of Don Juan. He engages in a fight and Sganarelle tries to keep them apart. To Don Juan: "Sir, leave this poor man alone. It is a pity to beat him" (pp. 736-37). And to Pierrot: "Listen, my poor boy. Go home, don't speak to him" (p. 737). Don Juan nonetheless slaps Pierrot, who in turn lowers his head, leaving Sganarelle who stands behind him to receive a slap in his face; "You are now rewarded for your charity!" concludes Don Juan. The audience laughs but what is laughed at is on the one hand an unpredictable "lazzo" and on the other the ridiculous rational distance that Sganarelle, and the au- diences with him, have kept vis-a-vis the action. By means of Commedia dell'Arte "lazzo," narrative breaks its enclosed surface to address the audience directly in the person of its spokesman and to reshape its attitude by bridging the established distance. Although direct address is in keeping with the comedy's tradition, for asides to the audience have been used ever since the ancient comedy, there is a difference be- tween such traditional use and Moliere's. The traditional aside commented on the characters and their action, thus functioning as a suture that kept the fictional enclosure intact; here the very fictional content turns against itself to state how it should or should not be read. If we can't read it charitably, how can we then read it? Mathurine enters. She is a friend of Charlotte's and also a victim of Don Juan's relentless courtship. Communica- tion here totally breaks down, for the dialogue becomes an incredible trialogue (Charlotte-Mathurine-Don Juan simultaneously speak to one another) where the two peasant girls finally confront their hero, each asking to clarify and to tell the other who in fact the chosen one is. Promptly the Don gets himself out of the predicament</page><page sequence="18">457 / DON JUAN'S SPACE by whispering to one "I am all yours!" then whispering to the other: "One cannot bear others when one has seen youl" And then out loud to all: "I have a command to give, and I shall be back in a quarter of an hour" (p. 740). By making language the agent of a farce, simultaneously reflecting on itself at the expense of communication, narrative dissolves under the eyes of the viewer, who ends up being bombarded by an overabundance of contradictory dramatic signals. Constructed on a juxtaposition of "lazzi," this scene constitutes in the text perhaps the purest form of theatrical transgression of the act of reading. We can neither read it through the mediation of Sganarelle nor through the mediation of the other characters whose presence marks, if anything, the very dissolution of meaning. What we are left with is Don Juan's activity that, above and beyond meaning, does not cease to amaze us, to captivate our sensibility, to keep us victims of the seductive power of his theatrical being. Hence the privileged position of distance, where we were initially placed, signals nothing else but textual strategies to make us the direct recipients of Don Juan's aggressive spontaneity, the prisoners of a non-decodable energy springing out of the performative act itself. Distance is established only to be erased as we are drawn into sharing in a different kind of pleasure. The pleasure of a carnivalesque celebration proper to a popular form of entertainment that makes us watch, not Don Juan at a rational and moralizing distance, but rather watch the distance between per- former and audience being bridged. Such a theatrical mode does not posit the Art of theatre as an object to be con- templated and analyzed but as an experience to be felt. The self-reflexive nature displayed in the text does not jolt the viewer out of transparent identification with the action, it makes audiences perceive and experience the theatrical event as a story transcending any presumed origin, in forms and gestures. Conversely, such reflexivity theorizes the character as the metaphorical working through of a different theatrical system, at any rate one that follows another tradition, aiming at keeping the viewer in the bliss of an imaginary plenitude, in the bliss of laughter. A bliss that, ultimately, is directly related to the sexual/rhetorical bliss thematized in the play by Don Juan's performance. VI. Meanings, Origins, and the END Act III continues the text's own discourse by further dilating time, or temporal un- folding, through repetitions of the theatrical paradigms already established. Sganarelle, disguised as a Physician, performs a direct attack on medicine, in duet with Don Juan and much in keeping with Moliere's famous opinion on such science. (Moliere himself, by the way, played the role of Sganarelle.) Such duet has no bearing on the subsequent action. It stands at the opening of the act as a virtuoso performance radiating not from the story but from the theatrical presence of a famous comedian whose satirical style and material finds here space to perform. Nearing the end, however, the sketch quickly changes topic and attempts to reinscribe some deeper content in the character of Don Juan, Sganarelle: In life... one must believe in something. .... What do you believe in? Don Juan: I believe that two and two make four and that four and four make eight. Sganarelle: What beautiful faith! Your religion from what I see is the arithmetic .... [p. 745]</page><page sequence="19">458 / TZ, December 1985 Sganarelle then proceeds to tell him that anything in life has an origin, and that man in particular is a machine based on a determining cause and effect linking. To this, Don Juan replies with a silence broken only by his report that a pauper is passing by. Thematically, the value of this brief exchange resides in the contrasting of two possible theorizations of meaning. One is anthropomorphic and anthropocentric, in- asmuch as it is assumed to represent in man himself a transcending order, the other one is purely arithmetical, based on the evidence of facts, or more precisely on quanti- fication. While we could read such distinction as an iteration of the difference between Don Juan, and other fictional characters around him, like Elvira, the iteration of such contrast has, at this juncture, another function. It leads abruptly into the next scene, the famous exchange between Don Juan and the Poor Man. Don Juan blackmails as it were the Poor with the very signs of the Pauper's world: Charity, Pity, and Money, but uprooted from their metaphysical context. He will give him a golden ducat if the pious Pauper will curse. Consequently, the charitable act of giving would be accomplished as a transgression of both ethical codes and any causal- ity that could link the two characters. The curse is expected to operate, in other words, as the erasure of the very narrative context in which the "Poor" defines himself: namely, to accept patiently Heaven's will and to love and pray for his fellow men, while awaiting his eternal reward. Such is the rhetoric of poverty on earth, as the poor mimetically repeats it and which he seeks reflected in Don Juan. However, blasphemy uttered under the auspices of charity, rhetorically signifies an attempt on the part of Don Juan to articulate a metonymic reversal that pits the character against the very language that should portray him. It signifies the opening of an ironic cleavage and a highly theatrical bursting of a given referential system. If we were to read these two scenes (Don Juan / Sganarelle, Don Juan / The Pauper) syntagmatically we would have to bridge the gap between them by extrapolating the origins of Don Juan's behavior from a cynicism that consciously threatens the established order of the world. We would have to ask again Sganarelle's question "What do you believe in?" and fill in the silence of Don Juan with our own implicit iteration of the very order that the personage transgresses. In other words, we would have to translate the geometrical, space-oriented structure of the text into a chronologically ordered narrative. If, on the other hand, we read these two scenes paradigmatically, as they are arranged in the text, that is in a kind of parallel montage ante litteram, we are quickly confronted with a dual-focus system - Sganarelle&gt; Don Juan, Don Juan, The Poor - which in a different key, mirrors again the nexus of Moliere's text: the juxtaposition and contrast of two different modes of representation, two different theatrical systems. Essentially, Don Juan's stance vis-a-vis the Poor is not different from the one he took in the scene with Elvira. In a quite similar fashion, he destabilizes signs and their meanings to cast them back to a world where he does not belong. As he does so, he uses them in reverse as metonymic display of his own metaphorical theatrical being. Ultimately, such rhetoric of reversal splits the theatrical space in which it occurs into two qualitatively different spaces. One (Elvira's, the Poor's, and, to an extent, Sganarelle's) in which text is expected to become action; the other (Don Juan's) where action becomes text. The remainder of the third act shows Don Juan involved in a series of mishaps that</page><page sequence="20">459 / DON JUAN'S SPACE cause him suddenly to become the courageous defender of a man alone (Elvira's brother) fighting three attackers. Upon realizing that the man he just saved - Don Carlos - is looking for him to avenge the honor of his sister, he does not hesitate rhetorically to double himself into two characters as he tells Don Carlos, who does not yet know him: "I am so attached to Don Juan that he would not come to a duel without my duelling too . . . tell me when you want him to appear and oblige you" (p. 750). With this promise he leaves Don Carlos waiting, to no avail, for the fictional Don Juan who would perfectly fit both Elvira's and his own scenarios, while the other Don continues to cross his own theatrical space escaping those who chase him and thusly moving toward his own possible end. As we know, it is indeed a fantastic theatrical machine that will cause his end. A moving and talking statue to whom Don Juan will give his hand, from whom he does not and cannot escape, in whom he finds the only suitable end of a theatrical story with no true beginning. The statue is first met in the last scene of Act III where, by pure chance, the Don and his servant suddenly find themselves in front of the magnificent mausoleum built for the dead Commandeur. They enter, look in awe, and, as spectacle begets spectacle, the statue makes signs, nodding its head. First, Sganarelle sees this movement as he delivers a dinner invitation to the statue. Panic-stricken, stammering, he attempts to warn his master, who rather disturbed, ignores him and proceeds to extend a personal invitation. The statue nods again. This time, however, Don Juan does not know how to read, how to respond to a theatrical phenomenon as strange as himself. Here, the text takes a second and more radical ironic turn because it operates on the protagonist the same reversal he had played on other characters, namely returning to them the signs of their own world. Only this time, signs are those of pure spectacle. Here, ac- tion becomes action. The mask and the theatrical machine join in a transparent iden- tification: they both play the same game. But as a more powerful theatrical machine takes over, Don Juan runs out of space, undergoes a process of total de-realization, and the mask finds its final apotheosis in pure spectacle. Don Juan cannot reply to the nodding just as he could not listen to Sganarelle, for his rhetoric has no further power. The only listening agent is the audience to whom Sganarelle turns and says: "So much for strong minds who believe in nothing!" (p. 756). The end is already framed as a finale without a readable and meaningful closure. In Act IV, the initial great mobility of the Don is totally reduced, for we see him confined inside his own house where other characters come to visit him. These are: M. Dimanche, to whom the Don owes money, his father, Elvira, a ghost, and finally the Statue. Within the walls of his home he is confronted first with a microcosm of a bourgeois society whose stability is based on fixed values such as economic power, family and origins, love and marriage, and then with a symbolic microcosm of the theatre: ghostly appearances and machinery. The issue of debts and solvency is quickly disposed of, on a farcical key, for M. Dimanche who comes to claim his dues, is never allowed to speak being over- whelmed by an overabundance of words and obliging politeness: a mimicry of bourgeois conventionality. He enters the house of Don Juan as a shy and silly man who unknowingly enters the wrong space, with the wrong text, and thus is promptly expulsed from it.</page><page sequence="21">460 / TJ, December 1985 With the entrance of the father, however, the rhythm slows down considerably, shifting from a farcical tune to a more serious and reflexive one. Outraged by Don Juan's familiar conduct, his father Don Luis confronts his son in a desperate attempt to save him. By reminding his son of his noble family origins, Don Luis hopes to restore in the son a sense of moral responsibilities that family history should have imposed on him since birth. He attempts, in other words, to reinstate the son in a determining historical continuum from which, in the father's perspective, Don Juan has strayed: "The son which Heaven has granted me is the Grief and Punishment of this same Life which, I thought, he must comfort and rejoice. ... Do you believe 'tis a glory to be sprung of Noble blood when a Man lives like an infamous Wretch? . . . In vain you descend from the Ancestor you sprung from; they disown you for their blood and all their illustrious Actions give you no Advantage" (p. 763). Despite its clarity, this speech is at the outset characterized by an ironic displacement for it delivers at least two meanings. If it moralizes on the irresponsible behavior of Don Juan, it also develops a subtext on Don Juanism. As a mode of being, Don Juanism is represented as sheer transgres- sion. First the promise to "rejoice" that the birth of a son implicitly offers the father, is not kept. That promise is transgressed inasmuch as the expected comfort derived from a sense of temporal continuity through the creation of "generations" is transformed here, upon the appearance of a son, into Grief and Punishment. The content of this Grief is furthermore constituted by a seemingly unjustifiable rupture of temporal duration and continuity of meaning. Through time, the illustrious actions of Ancestors, in Don Juan's eyes, have lost their meaning to the point that they are totally unknown to him. Thus, Don Juanism is, in essence, the embodiment of the subversion of the genetic principle as a way to arrive at an identity.24 And, textually, Don Juan remains a mystery for his father just as much as he was probably an enigma for Moliere, just as he remains today an enigma for the contemporary reader/viewer. Threatening him with severe punishment, the father exists. Don Juan alone says both to himself and to the audience: "Oh well! Die as soon as you can that's the best you can do. To each his own, and I cannot stand to see fathers who live as long as their sons" (p. 763). Though shocking from the point of view of the father, this reply gives, for the first time in the text, a clear clue for a reading. Simply stated, faced with Don Juan, the reader cannot ask questions about who Don Juan is and what his origins are, because in his world "fathers are not expected to live as long as their sons." Construed as a son, Don Juan can at best exist only upon the death of the father, upon the disappearance of origins into the transparency of self- sufficient outer appearances and gestures. Thus, at one level Don Juan's function is to embody theatricality and/or theatre itself, but, at another level the personage em- bodies as well Moliere's own dramatic will to theatrical authority. Perhaps a more suitable question to ask is "what does he do?" His text, in other words, demands another kind of reading that places the critical act within the very process of staging the spectacle where both ideology and idealism achieve theatrical visibility, that is to say where history, origin, social status become unprivileged constituents of spectacle, carnival, and laughter. 24 Ibid., pp. 50-52.</page><page sequence="22">461 / DON JUAN'S SPACE Thus the father) son exchange placed near the end reflects on and theorizes the very concept of representation as posited in this Commedia dell'Arte-like theatrical system. What re-presentation means here is not to present anew, in the modality of time, but to present in addition to, in the modality of space. It means further, a utopian and metaphorical process of temporary liberation that Mikhail Bakhtin describes as: ". .. liberation from the prevailing truth and from the established order; . . . the suspension of all hierarchical rank, privileges, norms and prohibitions." A process the essence of which resides in: "the fantastic combination of heterogeneous elements of reality, in the breaking up of the established world order, in the free fancy of its images and in the 'alternate succession' of enthusiasm and irony." 2s Textually, representation means here that very "heteroglossia" that Bakhtin sees as the essence of the "carnivalesque," the "heteroglossia" of different voices and genres that is produced by transgeneric crossings or rhetorical catachreses. Elvira makes a last attempt to win back Don Juan: "Save yourself, I beg you for the love of me or for the love of yourself ... I ask you again in tears" (p. 765). Don Juan cannot read her tears, and she will have to remain fixed in a chiasmatic stance with her hero. The statue arrives and issues a new invitation to dinner but this time in its home. Is it the Mausoleum? Is it the theatre? Probably both, for as we have seen, the statue leads Don Juan both to death and to his final theatrical apotheosis. Textually, the statue's presence functions as a compounded metaphor. Already constituted as an am- biguous metaphor, as an unclear sign of Don Juan's past while being also an image of the theatre and of the will of God, the statue moves now on stage proliferating mean- ings which cannot be grounded in any truth. As it prepares to exit, Don Juan requests lights to show the way and the status replies: "One does not need light, when on is guided by Heaven" (p. 769). If Heaven is the originary source of the statue and this lat- ter, its representation, then Heaven speaks of its transcendence only metaphorically, through layers of representational forms which at no time can be read in any light of truth. Heaven, in other words, stages itself by means of a grandiose Mausoleum, by means of an extraordinary theatrical machinery not as luminous, primary source, but rather as a machine of representation, as a glittering mask behind which there remains an abyss of darkness. It comes as no surprise therefore that throughout this act Don Juan takes on an attitude of complicity with the statue shown with no other characters. As they both are metaphorical representations of pure spectacle, they are together enclosed within the same code.26 25 M. Bakhtin, Rabelais and His World (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984), pp. 10-41. 26 On Moliere and Mask see H. Gaston Hall, Comedy in Context, Essays on Moliere (Jackson: Univer- sity of Mississippi Press, 1984), p. 54. As he writes: ". .. Faire d'une tradition de masques qui identifie une persona dramatique, la source des masques d'hypocrisie qui cachent les veritables intentions d'un per- sonnage qui joue un r6le 'metathatral' en contradiction avec son vrai role, a toujours 4t4 un contresens." If we assume that behind the mask there resides a true identity, then the tradition of the Commedia dell'Arte is indeed of little importance to a reading of Moliere. The fact remains that neither in the Com- media nor in Don Juan the mask appears to hide any originary identity.</page><page sequence="23">462 / TJ, December 1985 Act V shows the protagonist making one last great performance before disappearing into the depths beneath the stage. He will play the hypocrite casting around himself a final network of confusion or a final statement on the impossibility of reading and/or narrating Don Juan. For his father, he will play the penitent giving him the image of the son he always wanted. In his words: "Heaven, suddenly, caused in me a change that will astonish everyone" (p. 769). The audience knows by now what Heaven means or rather what Heaven does not mean, thus emptying Don Juan's monologue of any moral or religious content and focusing the viewer's eyes on the extraordinary vir- tuosity of the character.27 To Sganarelle and to the audience, however, Don Juan subsequently theorizes hypocrisy as an "Art, the imposture of which is always well respected" (p. 771). As he explains, others may very well know the device of hypocrisy, may very well see through it, but they nonetheless remain - as per a tacit agreement - fascinated by it and translate it into true communication and meanings: "a little hanging down on the Head, a mortified Groan, a turning of the eye set all to rights" (p. 771) for the beholder. Art of mimic, of gestures and intonation, hypocrisy is in substance the theatrical space where language is created for misreading it or, more precisely, where language functions as rhetorical /metaphorical construct that privileges form over content. In the hypocritical performance, any given sign posits a multiplicity of mean- ing that depends on the beholder and on the contingencies of the act of speaking and listening. If then "hypocrisy" is the privileged and productive mechanism of theatre, by defini- tion one cannot define or conceptually ground either the signifying function of theatrical language or the signifying function of Don Juan and his masks. Further- more, the signifying system controlled by the personage's "hypocrisy" does not allow for a metalanguage that would have the language of "hypocrisy" as its object, for the character is already a mask, a metaphorical construct speaking only metaphorically, in our case hypocritically. And, in fact, nowhere in the text is a definition of the "con- cept" of hypocrisy given.28 Meaning, therefore, cannot exist as an abstract ideality, independent from the materiality of the theatrical signifiers which act mainly on the senses. Meaning in theatre is genetically inseparable from the medium of representation and cannot exist purely in the mind, independent from perception. The theatrical system of the Com- media dell'Arte - and perhaps of all theatre, as Moliere's Don Juan shows - is at best characterized as the creation of a space where subjectivist epistemology and materialist semiology play with and against each other.29 What the Commedia means 27J. Rousset, p. 67, discusses at length Don Juan as actor. 28 See D. C. Potts, "Don Juan" and "Non-Aristotelian Drama" in Moliere: Stage and Study (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973), pp. 61-72. My reading is quite similar to Potts's. We differ in our conclu- sions for the "critical awareness" in which Moliere provokes his audience, as Potts shows, finds, in my view, its dissolution into the theatrical communication generated by a different and perhaps more popular tradition. 29On Moliere and the Italian theatre see also P. A. Wadsworth, Molibre and the Italian Theatrical Tradition (Cooper Square: French Literature Publication Co., 1977).</page><page sequence="24">463 / DON JUAN'S SPACE will always depend on a system of interpretations without truth-value, since meaning is inseparable from its representational system and from sensuous perception. Any reading of it becomes of necessity a misreading, at any rate a betrayal of what appears to be an original meaning.30 It is neither surprising that the Commedia's theatrical system had no text (at least text as traditionally understood) nor that Moliere focuses his version of the legend on a sustained conflict between two groups of personages: those who want to reduce Don Juan to an ultimate meaning, to a readable text, and a Don Juan, who at no time will yield such meaning. The final monologue on hypocrisy is textually a compounded metaphor of the theatre looking at its own activity, ultimately looking at its own metaphorical essence. In conclusion, Don Juan fittingly disappears from our over- whelmed gaze, into the mechanical machinery that generated him in the first place. No need to search anywhere else to justify this end. As we have seen, the last address of Sganarelle to the audience casts it back to us not as an end but as question as to what could possibly constitute an end to the theatrical mode of Don Juanism. The only criteria left to justify it is that of pleasure. From the perspective of the Commedia, pleasure is the only measure of judgment for the theatrical act; there is no other ground on which to determine the ultimate truth value of Don Juan and his theatri- cality. At a time when Moliere was under heavy attack from his contemporaries, who saw or wanted to see in the author the subversive spokesman of libertinage and of counter- cultural values, he replied by returning more directly to his own theatrical sources and staged the ineluctability of misreadings in any form of spectacle. With Don Juan more so than with The Misanthrope, Moliere left perhaps a testament. As a will, the man of the theatre looks back with nostalgia at a popular theatrical art in the process of changing under the compelling pressure of the dominant ideology and of becoming what essentially it was not meant to be. In spite of the uproar that Moliere's dramaturgy created around itself, King Louis XIV granted Moliere a pension of ?6,000 a year. The King's bequest to Moliere is perhaps more meaningful than what it may seem at first. Such symbolic gesture signifies that the King looked suspiciously at a theatre of "pleasure" claiming to be an aestheticist defense (in Barthes's sense) against the incursions of the social-political. From the Monarch's point of view the theatrical/ carnivalesque pleasure always remains (as Bakhtin would have it) the means of art's intervention into the discourse of ideology. Yet, political power by attempting to legitimize spectacle ironically placed itself right at the heart of the theatrical power of Don Juan. Though the King - himself a great dramatist - may have understood the play in its fully hermeneutical implication, his gesture recognized that the play could exceed the control of the State. His seal, in other words, recognized that the play had achieved some power and authority with- out being fully co-opted by ideology. Thus Moliere's Don Juan remains historically 30 On Mask and Commedia dell'Arte see also A. Nicoll, Masks, Mimes and Miracles (New York: New York University Press, 1963) and The World of Harlequin: a Critical Study of the Commedia dell'Arte (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1963).</page><page sequence="25">464 / TI, December 1985 fixed in a highly ironic middle-ground. On the one hand it creates an aesthetic space that is protective of the artist, of Moliere and of Don Juan. On the other, the play keeps threatening the ruling order precisely because it convinced the ruling order to accept its "entertaining" spectacle as appropriate. But then the theatrical originality of Don Juanism and its Commedia dell'Arte sources may well reside precisely in this ironic stance. "Don Juanism" keeps framing any interpreting act as a peculiar attempt to displace a theatrical subject that instead of allowing itself to be a target of our critical sight, keeps looking at us, in the name of pleasure, from behind his mask, as we attempt to read and to displace him.
