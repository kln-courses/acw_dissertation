In 1946 it was Pavese who gave me Thorstein VeblenTs The Theory of the Leisure Class so that I could work on the Italian translation (after Vittorio Foa and Antonio Giolitti had declined). The translation was published by Einaudi early in 1949, and immediately Benedetto Croce's attack appeared in the Corriere della Sera of January 15. Naturally, there was a polemical exchange in Critica economica and other journals, and Pavese persuaded me to participate with two articles in the Rivista di filosofia. Nevertheless, the arguments and polemics of late idealism had already ceased to be of interest to me. I had other things to think about, for Pavese, with a certain amount of unconscious cruelty, seemed to amuse himself by getting me worked up. From the time of our walks in the hills of Serra lunga di Crea, in Monferrato, in the last years of the war (when we amazed the German soldiers on patrol by reading at the tops of our voices the "Chorus mysticusn from Faust: TtAlles Verg?ngliche ? ist nur ein Gleichnis.. .Das Ewig-Weibliche ? zieht uns hinan"), questions of sociology, cultural anthropology, and social psychology became part of our standard hiking gear. We were two inspired discoverers of new sciences. The breadth of PaveseTs knowledge and interests fascinated me. Besides the TTcomfortableTt or "easy" class, as we later decided to translate Veblen's "leisure class," we talked about FrazerTs "golden bough," ReikTs studies of ritual, Marx and Weber, and the fragility of human rationality and the meaning of myth as the dawning of consciousness. Later Pavese persuaded me to translate the psychoanalytical interpretations of the rites of primitive peo ples put forward by Theodor Reik, Freud's great disciple and "re former." In August 1948, when I was in England, he wrote about vii</page><page sequence="6">viii MAX WEBER this jokingly to me: MAnd howTs Reik? Have you stuck with him, or are you waiting for it to be done by parthenogenesis ?" He added: TTI am pleased that you're almost settled ? and at Hastings too, like William the Conqueror_ I admire your courage, but clearly I am too old to do the same. I prefer to know England from books. I believe itTs useful_ Enjoy the big ankles. A girlTs the best way of learning a language." Pavese was not a boy who had never grown up or who grew up only belatedly and turned out badly. He was just a peasant from the Langhe, moved to town but never completely Minsertedn in the big city, always in acute discomfort in his relations with his fellow citizens, their ease of manner, and their indifference to place and to the countryside. Like any peasant, he traveled unwillingly, holding it to be a useless waste. As he used to say, "We have China beneath our feet." He was taciturn, difficult, and could also seem shy, with his angular face and his mouth set partly like a teacher's, partly in irony. Yet he was one of the most open and candid men I have ever met, someone who, after hours of silence, could suddenly become jovial and chat, ready to drain the Barbera supply of one of the wine shops on the outskirts of Turin, where the main roads end and the fields begin (or used to). Between us there was an unconscious bond of complicity. Peas ants fall into two categories: they either serve, or burn, castles. But in either case they conspire, and sniff each other out. When Einaudi's administration fell behind in paying me for my transla tion, Pavese went on strike. This was announced in a few dry phrases in a note pinned on his study door. Balbo couldn't stop laughing at it. But Balbo, who understood everything, could not understand, man of the city as he was, our tacit agreement. I have already had the opportunity of describing elsewhere my dialogue with Felice Balbo ? a very intense one, almost uninter rupted, which lasted from a spring morning in 1945, in Corso Um berto in Turin, to a last meeting in the Fatebenfratelli Hospital in the calm of the Isola Tiberina in Rome. Even after long separa tions ? for my incurable nomadic habits took me far afield ? we resumed the conversation again precisely at the point where we had left off. We rapidly reconstructed the main lines of the argu ment and sometimes finished off an illustrative example as if we had parted only the previous evening. I am reminded of Plato's Phaedrus: the only possibility the eye has of seeing itself and recognizing itself is in reflection, in a friendly eye. Between us there were many basic differences, even serious ones, in addition</page><page sequence="7">PREFACE ix to the gap of a generation, and perhaps different origins and fu tures. Yet I cannot remember Balbo without feeling deeply the condition of fantastic, almost euphoric, receptiveness in our con versations, and also a condition of physical well-being, probably the consequence of a peaceful tension, not a competitive one, in a mutual, patient exploration. I cannot think of Felice Balbo without remembering first not his explicit philosophical thought or his work experience, both editorial and commercial, or his political militancy, but rather certain of his human qualities that are nowadays very rare and certain atti tudes that filled out his personality with a wonderful balance ? his ability to listen, his openness to others and to things alien, and his attitude of happy, almost childish surprise in the face of new ex perience. I remember the visit he paid us in Paris one autumn evening in 1958, when he was returning from England. We had just pro visionally settled ourselves ? my wife, my children, and myself ? on the hill at Suresnes, not far from the Bois de Boulogne, in a little house lost in a big, rather sad, abandoned park. It looked out on the imposing, ugly grey Hopital Foch and had behind it the un really geometrical war cemetery of Mont Valerien (during the Re sistance, Gabriel Peri died here after being tortured by the Nazis). I had decided on our move unexpectedly. In three days we had left Rome, bag and baggage, and settled in as best we could in the out skirts of Paris, on the Rue du Calvaire, Suresnes. This happened when I was sure that Adriano Olivetti had neither the intention nor the capacity to resist the "dynastic groups," as I called them then, that were preparing to eliminate the organizational structures of the Comunita movement, or at least reduce them to an instrument solely for the manipulation of workers. Felice Balbo came to Sur esnes one dark evening to look us up, carefully climbing the awk ward path that led to our house. It was a peaceful and unforgettable occasion. Balbo's enthusiasm was contagious. He sat upright against the back of the chair as he talked and told stories, enunciating clearly so that the children too could follow him perfectly. He told us about England. It had been his first visit there. He was very "impressed" by it. English architecture ? all those single-family houses, with their front windows ? had struck him as the perfect marriage of private and public aspects, of family and society. Then came a very acute ob servation: the English, unlike Americans or Italians, for example, did not work hurriedly, but rather slowly and constantly. They had</page><page sequence="8">x MAX WEBER a better staying quality; they went slowly, but continually; they had not yet discovered idleness. Then, there was tradition. The En glish were traditionalists. Happy, even a bit crazy, all of them. With such a solid tradition, they could certainly allow themselves an extra pinch of madness, of eccentricity. He told us about this with great refinement and openness. Then he spoke to me in the Turin dialect, just a few words to make me feel I was once more under the arcades of Via Po or Piazza San Carlo. I answered with some difficulty. I am not a genuine Tori nese. I come from the Bassa Vercellese, and am from Turin by adoption ? or perhaps not even that (with the passage of time has come adoption upon adoption, but then it is worth adopting the world). Balbo encouraged us. He was immediately aware of our difficult material and psychological situation, and restored our morale with a perfect imitation of Lora Totino or Pella or some other charac ter. In the house there was no furniture other than the essentials. I had set up my books in whiskey cases stacked vertically against the walls. He looked at them and said, with a quick gesture at once malicious and tender, as though he were drawing a seashell in the air, fTt reminds me of Mondrian. It would make an architect think of a new kind of shelf...." It is hard, perhaps impossible, to penetrate and understand the secret of a life. Yet this capacity for listening, an exception in a world that identifies happiness with self-affirmation and has for gotten the virtue of sacrifice, seems to me one of the keys to the understanding of the destiny and the contribution of Felice Balbo. I could also add to this humility (a quality to which he dedicates a whole chapter in his Idee per una filosofia dello sviluppo umano). However, I do not wish to be misunderstood. BalboTs ability to lis ten was only the premise, the existential and philosophical precon dition, for a dialogue in which there was nothing less than rigor, nothing indulgent or vulgarized (in the pejorative sense in which this term is commonly used). In other words, his ability to listen not only served to indicate the philosophical refusal of monist reduction, the Hegelian posses sion of the Absolute, and the reflection of a recognized common ality, essential between all "participant beings." It was a generous and unyielding capacity to listen which forced others to be authen tic, not to cheat. In terms of behavior, it was above all the conse quence of respect for the "otherness" of others, their needs and their questions. Balbo was constantly waiting for the question,</page><page sequence="9">PREFACE xi because he realized himself in seeking the reply. Thus, his cease less dialogue was not only, or rather was not at all, an idiosyn crasy, an individual approach ? it was his life. It was not a de vised program, but his mode of self-realization, his self-image, his conception of the intellectual. One sees this very clearly in an interview with him published years ago in Tempo Presente: The intellectual is a man who rejects prefabricated truths, who does not doze over dogmas but who poses questions and seeks re plies. He continually reopens arguments that were believed closed, closed forever_ This was a problematic consciousness, but not problematic for its own sake; not, that is, a romantic catastrophism, with the hybrid foundation of complacent narcissism and sado masochism which is natural to it. Rather, in Balbo, there was a problematic consciousness that took on the sense of a calculated rejection of the automatic rationality of history proposed by his toricism. Historicism... of necessity argues that the rationality of history is given and basically automatic or even mechanical. And yet the present course of human history presses in as an objective and demanding difficulty for the historicist philosopher. Today, in fact, it is not men but man's products, cut off from him and turned into social machines, which determine the course of history. These products, rather than being a means, have become a growing obstacle to the rationality and humanity of the historical process, to which every day larger masses of men are enslaved (Idee, pp. 34-35). This is a basic point in the radical critique Balbo made against historicism, and I am largely in agreement with it. Balbo wrote: men can make their history, but only if they know and want to act according to the laws and determinacy of human nature; otherwise, though they may accumu late culture, things, machines, and despite the greatest possible activism, they suffer history (Ibid.). Whereas Balbo talks of human nature, I speak about middling senti ment, or common consciousness. This is something that can be established not through deductivist reasoning but by means of posi tive social research techniques. I am talking of the meaningful human situation, of community judgment, participation, authentic inter subjectivity. BalboTs reasoning, even though he declared that for him Thomas Aquinas "is neither a starting nor a finishing point," still seems to be Artistotelian-Thomist, restoring and re absorbing all possible experience within the large, given, cate</page><page sequence="10">xii MAX WEBER gorial and ontological structures. I do not believe that man has a nature as a table or a chair does. Man has, makes, history; he cannot avoid it. He lives and becomes real not in a history that is already historical, penetrated and resolved in rational thought with out "residues," but in a history that is made in and for individuals and is unpredictable; history as a responsibility for rational man agement, without preconstituted guarantees, a responsibility to be permanently discharged. The only plausible definition of man is that he is not a perfectly definable being. Hence arises the drama of human existence: every man every moment makes a gesture that saves or damns him. The intentionality of human action must be continuously rediscovered and reaffirmed. Balbo declared: "The unreasonable rationalist trust in the spontaneity of history, in its automatic rationality, becomes clearly absurd." In this perspective, the paradox of our time could not escape Balbo: in the very moment when poverty is about to be conquered and abolished (that is, when we have the technical means to defeat it), the demand for the higher values whose satisfaction was be lieved to be hindered, or at least postponed, by the existence of poverty, has diminished. The affluent society seems to present it self as a one-dimensional society that believes in development for its own sake and sees man's task as "doing for its own sake." It has separated production from real needs and thus condemned it self to creating imaginary needs; it has lost the models and criteria of judgment needed rationally to listen to, and manage, itself. Balbo remarked: "What is especially grave and exceptional in the situation is the paradoxical historical coincidence of an extreme need for philosophical orientation.. .with an increasing diminution of the demand for such an orientation." He was aware of the com plexity of the question. His books are spare sequences of notes ? they suggest an attitude typical of the brilliant amateur. In Balbo's work there certainly are statements that should be revised and critically qualified. In my view there are also interesting develop ments, particularly with reference to technique and its influence on human coexistence, that require evaluation. There also seem to me to be some gaps, and whole logical expositions that are in sufficiently explicit. The historical information needs to be broad ened ? Balbo!s sharp intuition is no substitute for this. Balbo asks himself: Is it possible to undertake this research today, seeing that, given the breadth and depth of the crisis, it will mean reopening, at least to some extent, not only</page><page sequence="11">PREFACE x?i all the basic problems of philosophy normally regarded as having been resolved or overcome, but also all the basic problems of the social and historical sci ences? .. .1 believe one must answer preeminently along the lines of the clas sical fable of the giants and the pygmies, and with particular emphasis. What the giants cannot see, the pygmies will because they can, and know how to, climb onto the shoulders of giants (Ibid., p. 37). Thus Balbo decisively began a radical critique of what I have termed the "organizational myth," or the tendency to resolve the major human and social problems of our time in terms purely of organization, of know-how. This is the inevitable result of the technocratic mentality that manages the unilateral, rigid processes of planning in East and West, a mentality justified by a common belief in history as an impersonal force endowed with automatic organizing powers. The history that is here criticized at its roots is not the real history of real men, but the history of idealist his toricism, whether of the right or of the left. It discounts research before doing it, and speaks in the name of the transcendental Ego in order to limit its own interest to existence not as it is, but as it is thought; the real, all reality, is equated with known, or rather thought, existence. Balbo went from the transcendental Ego of modern philosophy to the omni-existential ego of the philosophy of being which, in total freedom of the spirit, beyond the usual Thomist Schemas and those of neoscholasticism, prepared to elaborate a philosophy as activity; that is, the elimination of the myths and fantasies of childhood; the complete experi enced acceptance of history; the sense of liberty, risk, inventiveness; the sense of the division of roles and functions in work and defined responsibilities, the duty of social production;.. .and above all, the elimination of the concealed, but for that reason more serious, rationalism found in various forms in the scho lastic tradition (Ibid., pp. 63-64). Balbo's elimination of historicism may seem hasty, and in my view it needs a better-articulated mediation. The philosophical knowl edge he maintains and advocates is an existential, that is, an his torical, historically determined, knowledge. The historicism that needs destroying is the dogmatic kind that dissolves all possible human experience in itself and reduces existence to the essence of things. Yet despite our differences, which were deep, I came to feel close to Balbo's attempt at a philosophical reconstruction be cause of the shared conclusion of our inquiries ? that scientific (rationalist) knowledge is not the only possible knowledge, and that</page><page sequence="12">xiv MAX WEBER it does not exhaust all knowledge. If taken as incorporating and absorbing all possible wisdom, scientific knowledge falls into sci entism, sanctions the divorce between facts and values, and ends up by being technically perfect and humanly irrelevant. It is a fact of common daily experience that we are tempted by the impossible. This is not just a moralistic nitimur in vetitum. It is a temptation that goes deeper and ultimately is confused with a promise of omnipotence. That is, the impossible seems within oneTs grasp. What science fiction imagines is reality a week or a year later. Jules VerneTs fantasy does not hold back human ex ploits; rather, it is too conservative. Like every temptation, the temptation of the impossible simul taneously fascinates and frightens us. Undoubtedly it is a victory, but it is also a loss, if not a condemnation. Why? I shall try to answer this very schematically. To say that the impossible now seems within one's grasp means that the impossible no longer exists. Yet the collapse of the sense of the impossible brings with it a lessening of the sense of dramatic tension and intentionality which defines the destiny of every human being. Indeed, the defini tion of the destiny of man, his place and meaning in the universe, cannot be given once and for all. It is a permanent endeavor, an ever-open responsibility that is presented anew to everyone each day. I have already stated that every man every moment makes a gesture, determines on a choice that saves or damns him. There fore, to speak of a human nature in the dogmatic sense is pro foundly contradictory. The moment one declares that man is this or that, one denies precisely what makes him a man ? his ability to place himself in a problematic, and thus not exactly predict able or constrained, relation to his surroundings. Man does not have a nature the way plants or stones do. Man is something not perfectly definable. Man has history ? but what history? What does it mean to say that man is an animal who produces history ? "When I scratch man," said Marx, "I discover the German." But the aphorism can also be reversed: tTWhen I scratch the German, or the Russian, or the American, I discover the man." That is, I find in the actions of individuals and groups a common need for meaning, which I feel is not easily reducible or connectable to any fixed, deduced, or revealed model, but rather reflects ? if I may be permitted a highly elliptical expression ? the median conscious ness of men as derived from their intersubjective dialogue in a given historical epoch. This consciousness has no fixed, dogmatic</page><page sequence="13">PREFACE xv content, or enforced points of reference. The common humanity of human beings must not be sought in something given, but rather in their ability to place themselves in a meaningful relation, both as regards themselves and in their relations with the world. The humanity of the worker on the production line, who day in, day out, repeats the same movement, without being able to understand its meaning in the general economy of production, is seriously threat ened; equally seriously threatened is the humanity of the militant closed off from understanding others. Thus, the basic condition for the survival and continuation of humanity is the perception of ourselves as having the possibility of making history through de ciding on meaningful actions whose outcome is not initially foreseen and through nonstandardized intersubjective communication based on concrete human experience. In other words, making history means, in my judgment, to abandon the conception of history as an impersonal force. It means also to recognize in human behavior an element of indeterminacy which makes it not reducible to any formal explanatory scheme that claims to exhaust it completely, without residues. This makes for a serious uneasiness in a period like ours, an age that believes itself to be scientific. An age is scientific pre cisely because it leaves nothing in darkness, eliminates the myste rious, and claims to be able to clarify everything, but does not realize that whatever is too clear is no longer clear and risks be coming humanly irrelevant, deprived of meaning. This is the fron tier, and the point of contact, for scientistic positivism, historicist and panlogistic idealism, and historical materialism conceived dogmatically, that is, abstractly. When progress and development are the same, and the best becomes synonymous with the different, the meaning, and even the objective possibility, of every authentic human telos is lost. Acting humanly is made equivalent to the ani mal's doing for its own sake. And man ? a being who produces history, inasmuch as he is capable of teleological behavior ? sees himself condemned to progress, as his fate. That is, he is sen tenced to pure movement (production, consumption, exchange, etc.) with no necessary connection to his aspirations and his operative needs ? the only motivations that could give it meaning. Formal rationality ? as expressed in the technical correctness of the movement of a machine, repeated ad infinitum, with each movement identical to the previous ? obscures and blocks the transition to substantial rationality. The recovery of control over his own means of making history, and the recapture of science</page><page sequence="14">xvi MAX WEBER through its humanization, are possible for man today only insofar as he once more expresses, individually or in a group, the con sciousness of his own ends, affirming their absolute and noninstru mentalizable priority. The instrument of that awareness is culture. But what culture? Traditionally, one speaks of the man of culture as a carefree man of leisure, and of culture as the product of an educative process, paideia (Plutarch). Thus, the cultured individ ual is a member of a narrow elite in a social condition of objective privilege, sustained by an economy that presupposes the existence of slaves. This traditional notion of culture, in which culture amounts to an irresponsible solo trilling, cannot help us in the present situation of mankind; rather than being a critical instru ment it is a powerful element of mystification, in that it inevitably translates and reduces ethical problems to aesthetic attitudes, and objective questions to literary perorations. Nor can the notion of culture as a mere superstructure ? the sounding echo of objective socioeconomic structures ? be of much assistance. Culture is neither individualistic solipsism nor simple passive reflex. In reality, for human groups, culture is the irreplaceable instrument of self-consciousness and self-development; it is the means by which they grasp their own past and construct their own future. In this understanding and this construction there is nothing automatic or foreseen. This is the meaning of the new integrated culture, at once tech nical and humanist. It is capable of ending the dichotomy between facts and values, or between what is correct and what is opportune. This does not just mean making engineers read Shakespeare and explaining the second law of thermodynamics to men of letters. It means concretely, objectively, enabling individuals to realize them selves, their vocations, and the reason for their coming into the world. This is always true, but it is especially true today. We are living in a human-limit situation, one in which we no longer have an automatic guarantee against the self-annihilation of humanity. The problem of technology, or of the application of scientific technical discoveries on a large scale, is the basic problem of our times. Although it manifests itself in different forms, it is deter mined by the fact that technical judgment finds its justification (the origin of its juridical validity, so to speak) in the internal verifica tion of the mechanical correctness of its own operations. However, that judgment cannot go beyond itself, transcend itself: it creates no values, it cannot provide meaning for movement, or a direction for movement. More precisely than Heidegger's formulation,</page><page sequence="15">PREFACE xvii this is but the everlasting return of the identical. Scientific, spe cialist, utilitarian, calculating, and functional society, seemingly rational, loses in this way the sense of intentionality ? the TtwhyM of its own movement ? and tends to wear itself out in its own func tioning. Once the function has been discharged, this is, literally, a defunct society. In this sense, one can say it is floating in space; that certainly it has objectives, goals, indices of development or stagnation, but it has no aim beyond itself, toward which to move and against which to measure itself. It has objectives but these concern internal goals and cannot create even the illusion of a real alternative. In the real sense, it is a society without opposition, a society without a utopia. This problem, which could also be expressed as the problem of transition from formal to substantial reason (as in Mannheim), in volves what is generally formulated in psychological terms as mass apathy and alienation; these seem to be diffused at the same rate as the prosperity of technically and industrially developed society. In the situation and the context of such societies, alienation as estrangement, as a lack of personal participation, can become inevitable: one does not participate because there is nothing to participate in, nothing humanly significant. To clarify the specific terms of such a human situation is the pressing, most important, task for contemporary sociology. This task should never be forgotten or left out, for otherwise sociology becomes mere operational technique interpreted as research, or sterile formalism. However, the alternative implies a continuous, rigorous, and critical review of its historical perspective. Socio logists, equipped with survey techniques that they believe to be interchangeably useable, are generally too eager to dive into the ocean of objectivity, never pausing to question themselves in all conscience about the bases of their research. It is no wonder that the results are disappointing: "I hear the noise of the mill wheel, but I don't see the flour." One cannot always refute those many critics of sociology in whose eyes (even if they haven't looked) sociology borders on seeming no more than the illustration of the obvious, or the mere reorganization of common sense. The real treason of the intellectuals, and above all of the sociolo gists, is their refusal to introduce "into the problem" that which seems obvious to conventional wisdom. My reading of Weber is tied in to this perspective. It brings together ideas and interpreta tions with which I have been involved in recent years through the activities of the Institute of Sociology at the University of Rome,</page><page sequence="16">xviii MAX WEBER and with the collaboration of some of its members, especially Professors C. Antiochia and A. Catemario, and M. Di Giulio. More recently, I have had great benefit from discussions with Professor Kurt H. Wolff (Brandeis University) and from frequent correspon dence with Professor Alfred McClung Lee (Brooklyn College, City University of New York) ? a rich stimulus that would lead me to develop themes and problems mentioned here only in passing. In some ways these ideas have already drawn the attention of well known Italian scholars such as N. Abbagnano, F. Battaglia, N. Bob bio, P. Filiasi-Carcano, F. Lombardi, P. Rossi, C. Pellizzi, P. Prini, and R. Treves. Sociology only regained its academic citizenship in Italy a few years ago. However, a big victory is a great danger. Sociology raises expectations that it does not presently seem capable of sat isfying. Moreover, it tends to be coopted by the prevailing eco nomic interests, as a technique that by definition is instrumental. Sociologists react to their essentially uncertain practical and con ceptual situation in the classical manner: they invoke professional ethics while at the same time taking refuge in the no-man's land of a rarefied neutrality that is at once obscure without being rig orous. Ex-Marxists are converted to Talcott Parsons Ts systematic formalism only to rediscover, in anti-American terms, the fluid and problematic nature of social facts; they then try the "great synthesis" between ParsonsTs "static system" and Marx's "dynamic system." To remedy such enormous confusions, it is pertinent to reread Weber. Franco Ferrarotti Rome, September 1964</page><page sequence="17">Max Weber and the Destiny of Reason</page><page sequence="18">Weber 's Intent In our day Max Weber has been "embalmed.f? The modern systems theorists led by Talcott Parsons and the natural law theorists alike have leveled against him the facile charge of relativism. They have cleverly smoothed off his sharp corners and downplayed his uncertainties, leaving us with what amounts to a photogenic carica ture. This crude "positivization" of Weber has gone a long way, but a rereading of his texts settles certain questions with no room for doubt. For Weber, a methodology was like a pair of shoes: if it isn't good for walking, it should be thrown out. The object and the meth od of investigation are inseparable. His focus is always on social essence. There is no dichotomy between analytical concepts and basic theory. The third chapter of his Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, which sets out in a few pages the theory of power (traditional, ra tional or bureaucratic, and charismatic), is not simply a frame of reference. This is Weber's attempt to understand the society of his day, a Germany that had turned its back on agrarian Junkertum and had begun to industrialize, but lacked a real modern industrial ruling class ? open, cosmopolitan, rational, and democratic. This was a Germany that in a few years would develop a massive indus trial economy without a competent ruling group ? one liberated from the ghosts of feudal darkness and ancestral myths, and cap able of rationally managing its might. Weber's methodology ? that is, his reflections on his own work and his efforts to clarify conceptually precise, individual problems ? has been built up into a system via a process of abstraction and formalization that severed its direct link with Weber's concrete, specific research. Naturally, this did not happen by chance. In Europe as in America, though in different and even opposing ways, the sociologist is still seeking professional solidity, to guarantee 3</page><page sequence="19">4 MAX WEBER his security, social respectability, and immunity. "Value-free dom," as Weber supposedly theorized it, is an ideal platform from that point of view. It is at once the precondition and justification of a neutrality that allows the sociologist, as a new type of profes sional, to maintain a "clean hands policy" and avoid taking stands on controversial questions, restricting himself to a purely legal responsibility toward clients. My argument is that this interpretation of Max Weber cannot be sustained. It blocks off the possibility of the development of an integrated science of man, and destroys the conditions essential for giving direction and meaning to research. It reduces social analy sis to a wholly instrumental technique with no inherent justification for its own theoretico-conceptual or operational autonomy. The level of maturity of a science depends not only and not so much on its systematic character as on its operative and instrumental au tonomy and its research projects. Weber's influence, still very strong among devotees of the social sciences, should not therefore cause us to be misled. His is an exceptionally comprehensive in fluence, encompassing the fundamental contents of theories that explain society, as well as truly methodological problems, but it is not exempt from misinterpretation. I have pointed out elsewhere how Weber himself must be held responsible for some misunderstandings of his work and the meth odological and substantial positions he proposed in it.1 This is not only because of the complex, composite nature of his work, which is little concerned to display a mechanical unity or to present the appearance of formal exposition. Rather, it is because of his work's internal uncertainties, unresolved problems, the contradic tions between the ideographic-subjective element and the need for scientific standardization, and the dichotomy between means and ends, fact and value, of whose essential consequences Weber does not seem fully aware. These together make Weber's thought a necessary but highly ambiguous transition for the social sciences, tortuous and suggestive at the same time, hard to evaluate cor rectly, and yet indispensable for formulating a sociological analy sis that can be both scientifically grounded and humanly meaningful. As is well known, Weber's work appeared for the most part in the form of essays and articles collected later, generally after his death, in volumes whose content is arranged according to a logical order it could not originally have had. Only the essays on Reli gionssoziologie (Sociology of Religion) and the unfinished book Wirtschaft und Gesselschaft (Economy and Society) were conceived</page><page sequence="20">WEBER S INTENT 5 by Weber himself as organic wholes. The volume on Wissen Schaftslehre (Theory of Science) is made up of articles published in various periodicals, especially the Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft undSozialpolitik, of which Weber was co-editor. As for the other organic works and specific sociological investigations ? such as The conditions of agricultural workers in Germany east of the Elbe, thelnquiry on natural selection, adaptation, professional choice and social conditions of workers in large-scale industry, the interna tional study On the financial, political and moral conditions in journalism, and the famous analysis of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism ? these methodological pieces, written in the context of the Methodenstreit which marked an important phase of late nineteenth century German culture, do not give us a complete "doctrine of science." They are simply the methodologi cal reflection of a lively commitment to research. Their impor tance lies in their presentation as an attempt at theoretical-con ceptual elaboration and at the same time as the preliminary con struction of a frame of reference that constantly refers back to ongoing research. Consequently, what might easily be taken for a mere erratic fragmentariness finds its critical rigor and organic design in the constantly renewed contact with active research, viewed not merely as the mechanical application of interchangeable research tech niques but a conscious selection of problems, and hence as a human experience directed toward specific values.2 Weber's rejection of "system" is thus a conscious one. As he attacks and destroys the idea of system with its implicit closure, Weber puts forward the notion of an "open system." What may seem to be the raptus of a polymath of genius, busy simultaneously with politics, economics, historiography, religion, and so forth, in the name of an eclectic and basically irresponsible encyclopedism, is in Weber a pains taking, radical attempt to ground an "understanding sociology" (verstehende Soziologie). This would be a science aiming for the interpretative understanding of social action, with the objective of achieving a causal explanation of its path and its results. Concep tual categories cannot be established a priori; any relapse into metaphysics must be avoided. Categories must spring from re search as the origin of their validity, and must grow and develop along with the research itself. In this, one can see the unifying purpose of Weber's manifold and varied activities, and the focal point of his experience as man and scholar. The enormous range of his scientific interests, and his</page><page sequence="21">6 MAX WEBER remarkable erudition, make him a forerunner of the interdisciplin ary approach. Jaspers called this his "excessiveness," a kind of illusion-free, heroic dedication which made him "suffer through" problems, even as he asserted the need to dominate them by rea son. At different times, these qualities could make him appear as a man of action and man of politics, as an historian, or philosopher, or pure methodologist. His disciples, particularly Karl Jaspers and Gy?rgy Lukacs, have themselves added to the confusion. Among others, his wife, Marianne Weber, bent on making him the representative figure of a whole era, also stresses the encyclopedic aspect, which is clearly misleading.3 Weber is not a man of politics; or, better, if regarded as a man of politics he must be recognized as a man of politics manque, and necessarily so. This is the tragic aspect of Weber's life. He had a high degree of political sense, and understood politically what others desire; that is, he could translate their aspirations into plans for action. However, in a wider perspective he was aware of the need to understand, as well as to act. This was understand ing in a general sense, not immediately connected with problems of the utilization of understanding and of specific knowledge mas tered. His politics could be none other than the science of politics. When he once tried to found a political party on the premises of his science of politics, he had quickly to acknowledge that such a party was impossible, that in reality it was a "utopia."4 He could only withdraw and resume the habits of the traditional Gelehrter, how ever personally repugnant, returning to his studies convinced that "the qualities that make a man an excellent scholar and academic teacher are not the qualities that make him a leader to give direc tions in practical life, or, more specifically, in politics." In fact, it is pure accident if a teacher also possesses this quality.5 This is not just frankness. Weber is perfectly aware that politics is action; not commentary, not initiative, and not scientific des cription. He knows it is "violence," "force," exclusivity, a faith that excludes other loyalties, a pact with the devil. In this contrast between ethics and politics there is a good dose of naivete, but all the same we must give Weber credit for a remarkable consistency. Once he had identified the radical wickedness of the world and politics, Weber did not take the shortcut of the "beautiful spirits"; that is, he resisted the temptation of an aesthetician's evasion or a "thinning out" in abstract dialectical terms. As against the im practicable absolute ethic of principle he set up his dramatic "ethics of responsibility," the capacity of taking decisions for</page><page sequence="22">WEBER S INTENT 7 which one would pay personally, and the courage of "dirtying one's hands."6 Why? Certainly not for a mere professional ethic. Weber knows perfectly well that the perfect functionary, once his function is discharged, is literally "defunct." Those who see in Weber basically a man of politics and a theorist of the priority of politics in a sociological key cannot comprehend the basic problem of his thought, which marks it in an original manner. This refers to the possibility of making political judgment scientific, thus cor responding to the wider problem of how it is possible to account for in rational terms, or to explain by way of relatively standard ized causal or conditional explanatory Schemas, human action and social behavior. This means including their "subjective," irre ducible ? historic ? element as regards those of its aspects which are uniform and more or less recurrent, while at the same time clarifying the terms (the "cost," the objective consequences) of human choice in relation to values and its selective criteria. Max Weber's politicization is a serious obstacle to the under standing of his thought and his efforts, which constitute the lasting reason for our interest. This is true for Lukacs, who improperly politicized all Weber's work, proposing an interpretation that is a model of narrowmindedness and ideologico-doctrinaire sche maticism, and is also true for other commentators.7 It seems to me indisputable that Weber's strictly political ideas and the posi tions he adopted as regards specific questions of European and German politics of the time can be criticized profoundly, and that these rather crudely modify his proclaimed liberal-progressive, if not quite prosocialist, attitude. There are sociopolitical limita tions, linked to his family background and the cultural environment of his youth, which he never managed to overcome.8 However, his "nationalism," or more exactly his "national imperialism," cannot simply be reduced to that nationalism ? "the last refuge of scoun drels" ? which Lukacs correctly believes to be typical of the Phil istine petty bourgeois, terrified by the imminent egalitarianism of socialism.9 Jaspers not only convincingly revealed the limits of the anti-Wilhelmine policy which Weber had pursued for years, and his concern that "European politics should no longer be determined in Berlin," but also demonstrated that Weber was fully, sadly, aware of the deficiencies of the Prussian agrarian ruling group, which was still basically feudal, in leading Germany toward its responsibilities as a world power.10 In fact, there had to be a rational choice between industrial society and a static agrarian world, and one that guaranteed social unity in the country in the</page><page sequence="23">8 MAX WEBER void created between the fall of Bismarck and the dominance of the bureaucracy.11 Weberian nationalism has none of the aggressive or pseudovictimized rhetoric characteristic of fascist nationalism. Rather, it is the expression of a civic commitment, seen as an ab solute moral imperative. Jaspers commented: Max Weber was the last genuine national German; genuine, because he repre sented the spirit of Baron von Stein, of Gneisenau, of Mommsen, not the will to power for one's own empire ? at any price and above all others ? but the will to realize a spiritual and moral existence which holds its ground by power but also places this power itself under its own conditions. Max Weber, who very early saw the tremendous danger into which the Germans came due to the course of the empire of William, knew that there is a limit which means ruin, after which the survivors continue, but in a vegetative state which is without political meaning and therefore without common greatness. Politics can exist only in freedom.12 Weber wanted to save the "realm of ideas." Throughout his life he was obsessed and spurred on by the imposing shadow of Marx. His research on the Protestant ethic and world religions does in fact tend specifically to support the Marxist hypothesis, to test its level of credibility, and to calculate its potential one-sidedness. What distinguishes it is a profound intellectual honesty. In his in troduction to the comparative essays on Religionssoziologie, Weber wrote: No economic ethic has ever been determined only by religion. Obviously, it contains an element of specific legitimacy, determined by geographic-economic and historical facts.. .however, certainly one of the determinants of economic ethics ? and in fact only one of them ? is the religious conditioning of the con duct of life. However, this too, naturally, exists again within given geographic, political, social and national limits, deeply influenced by economic and political elements. Weber's attempt to provide an integrated, global explanation of social action that would escape the deficiencies of closed sys temic constructs and the classical fallacy of the sociologies based on the "dominant factor," seemed to Lukacs no more than a spuri ous, mechanistic universalism. He wrote: Weber attempted to achieve a general knowledge of social history. We start a new science of the age of decadence: sociology. It emerges as an autonomous science, as bourgeois ideologists want to study the laws and history of social development while separating them from economics.. .therefore, as Max Weber</page><page sequence="24">WEBER S INTENT 9 was a sociologist, an economist and an historian, but produced an ? acritical ? "synthesis" of this sociology and this economics and this historiography, the specialist separation of these sciences had to remain intact in his head as well.. .here it is already obvious how the capitalist division of labor insinuates itself into the soul of the individual, and deforms it; and how it ended up by transforming a man both intellectually and morally much above the average into a philistine.13 What is really "obvious" in this analysis is nothing more than Lukacs Ts arrogant inability to understand, and his application in a hur - ried and rather mechanical manner of criteria of judgment that in fact are extraneous to Weber's endeavor. One notes his remark able lack of understanding of a man, a scientist who, irrespective of any evaluation of results, had the courage and intellectual rigor to set in continuous, problematic juxtaposition both theory and in vestigation, empirical datum and interpretive schema, beyond any specialist "disciplinary patriotism" or established assumption, so as to make his work a necessary step toward the construction of the science of man in society. For Lukacs, on the other hand, Weber is and remains essentially a philosopher: "Thus, as a philosopher and follower of neo-Kantianism, he learned to give the sanction of philosophy to this separation and this methodological isolation. Philosophy was 'deepened' in him. The conviction grew that in this instance it was a matter of an 'eternal structure' of human intellect."14 It is a fairly common misadventure for sociologists to be regarded as philosophers, but in Weber's case this involves a total misunderstanding. It is not even surprising that with the passage of time, Lukacs's lack of understanding should become worse.15 Then too, there is a fairly common ambiguity. Even the most alert commentators on Weber seldom manage to avoid the tempta tion to look in Weber for what he himself, from the beginning, never tired of saying was not there.16 The generalities he tried to es tablish cannot be found at the level of conceptual generalizations in the properly philosophical, or essentialist, sense. He is not in terested in essences, and is not concerned ? knowing in any case that it is impossible ? to extract all the connotations of a particu lar object of enquiry. One is limited ? and this, if one thinks of the mistaken ambitions of the founders of sociology, is a remark able quality in Weber ? to the construction of verifiable, or at least plausible, typologies for the systematic organization of the mass of elementary empirical data. As for the basic question re garding the essence of the objects of analysis there is no state</page><page sequence="25">10 MAX WEBER ment, and for a sociologist, there is no responsibility to make one. That question goes beyond the level of an intersubjective discus sion in a scientific sense ? one that has the binding character of a public procedure once its methodological postulates are accepted, and controls its correct application. The basic question, according to Weber, is decided on the grounds of personal preferences. Thus, Merleau-Ponty is certainly correct when he states that one has to give a loose interpretation of Weber in order to be able to locate a philosophical system in him: "Such is the philosophy without dogmatism which one discerns all through Weber's studies. To go beyond this, we must interpret freely. Let us do this without imputing to Weber more than he would have wished to say."17 Merleau-Ponty's advice has gone unheeded. Tacitly or openly, Weber has still been seen as having, or at any rate having been endowed with, a speculative tendency that is purely philosophical ? as a philosopher connected with Rickert or Windelband, the so called Bavarian, or Heidelberg school, the "philosophy of values," or with Dilthey, Kant, or Hegel, and there are even those who link him with Plato.18 These are wayward interpretations. Clearly, Weber did not exist outside the cultural debate of his time. Karl Jaspers wrote of him that he was "the real philosopher of the times he lived in," and also that "he did not teach a philosophy but, rather, he was a philos ophy."19 However, this cannot justify an interpretation that ends up identifying sociology with philosophy, and a philosophy "of exis tence," moreover.20 Still less can this lead to thinking of Weber as a pure methodologist.21 His intention was different. It was to ground the autonomy of sociological judgment. The time for this was certainly ripe. In the last two decades of the nineteenth century, German culture had pursued a wide-ranging debate on the nature and function of the historical and social sciences, the Kulturwissenschaften. One of the open questions was definitely that of the autonomy of sociology. Denied the status of a science in its own right by the German his torical school, sociology had first of all to define its task, research projects, and methodological tools. This problem was made more acute by the fact that English and French culture were aligned with Comte and with Spenser in the direction of the systematic, all inclusive type of sociological research. German culture, on the other hand, though trying to free itself from the legacy of the historical school, maintained the connection between the social sciences and historical considerations. Hence</page><page sequence="26">WEBER S INTENT 11 it maintained the link between the historical, descriptive approach and the nomothetic, standardizing, systematic approach. Particularly in its polemic with positivist sociology, it stressed the difference be tween historical and social research and the natural sciences. Thus was raised the problem of the grounds on which the social, or cul tural, sciences could be regarded as objectively valid forms of knowledge ? the problem of the basis and meaning of their objec tivity. We know how the "Marburg school" carried to extremes the Kantian distinction between objectively valid knowledge and percep tions or experiences to be seen as merely psychic facts. Science and knowledge are reduced to their objective content, their logical validity, wholly independent of the subjective aspect by means of which they intrude into the life of an object. So, by contrast with post-Kantian idealism which saw in thinking subjectivity the only reality, the Marburg school saw the only reality as "thinkable ob jectivity." Dilthey on the one hand and Windelband and Rickert on the other provided different solutions to this problem. For Dilthey, the his torical, "cultural" sciences enter the area of sciences of the Spirit (Geisteswissenschaften), as distinct from the sciences of nature, both because of the difference in their sphere of enquiry and be cause of the different relationship between the subject of enquiry and the reality examined. In the world of nature, the reality ana lyzed is extraneous to man, while in the case of the historical and "cultural" sciences it is the human world itself, to which the sub ject belongs. On the methodological plane, the distinction between the two kinds of science is established by the antithesis between explanation and understanding, causality and intention. Windelband and Rickert suggest a different solution by putting the problem in logical terms. Windelband distinguishes between sciences directed toward constructing a system of general laws and those directed toward defining the specificity of a given phe nomenon. The theoretical distinction made by Dilthey between "nature" and "mind" loses its significance, as every phenomenon of nature or mind can be studied either by including it as a specific detail in a uniform whole or by isolating its individual character istics. Rickert on the other hand distinguishes the areas of study of natural science and historical knowledge on the basis of the presence or absence of a "value relation," that is, of the criteria which allow historical research to consider an object as "specific." We have briefly summarized the terms of the cultural debate in Germany at that time, since that is the world of thought in which</page><page sequence="27">12 MAX WEBER Weberian sociology took shape as an attempt to mediate between Dilthey's and RickertTs positions, characteristically by way of con crete research. RickertTs influence as regards Weber has, in my view, been especially overestimated.22 According to Jaspers, it was MMax Weber's influence which protected what was good in Rick ert,M and which "curbed his vanity."23 However, there can be no reasonable doubt that for Weber, as for his contemporaries, the central methodological problem was that of the critical basis and validity of those sciences that did not seem easily reducible to a "physique sociale" pure and simple ? to use Comte's term, which in addition, profoundly remodified, was taken over by D?rkheim.24 It should be stressed that for Weber the problem is never present in purely methodological terms. This indeed is the problem of a researcher grappling with specific, determinate phenomena to be interpreted critically, and whose interrelations must be analyzed not merely intuitively but scientifically. That is, they must be analyzed in an empirically relevant manner which can guarantee perfect intersubjective communicability and validity for everyone. It does not become the rhetoric of the pure ? that is, the abstract ? methodologist. Leo Strauss Ts surprise when he said that tTWeber, who wrote thousands of pages, devoted hardly more than thirty of them to a thematic discussion of the basis of this whole position," is injudicious.25 In Weber the critique of the remaining legacy of romanticism becomes an explicit rejection. All the work of the historical school seemed to him to be undermined by the introduc tion of metaphysical assumptions, which do not permit objective study in that they discount the results of research before it has been undertaken in practice. From a theoretical-conceptual, political point of view, Weber is closer to the "socialism of the chair" of Schmoller, Wagner, and Brentano, even though he clearly distinguishes his own position from theirs. The "socialists of the chair" had in fact commenced the task of throwing off not only the metaphysical assumptions of the historical school but also the latter's implicit political posi tions. In their view, the first place must go to scientific research. Weber's methodology, on the other hand, was indeed built up in the course of concrete research and arose from a practical neces sity, that of defining the function of social science and defining its instruments of investigation. Antoni puts it well in this regard when he says that "in a Germany divided by partisan pas sions, questions of principle, radicalism and fanaticism, Weber's sociology was intended to be a foundation for rational discus</page><page sequence="28">WEBER S INTENT 13 sion and thence for consensus." Weber freed his science from the task attributed to it by naive positivism ? that of increasing human happiness, of being the new faith as replacement for the old revelations. It has been rightly observed that it is not an exaggeration to place Max Weber right alongside Albert Einstein. Both came out of the great Methodenstreit and the empiriocritical corrosion of fin du siecle scientism; one showed the historical, the other the physico-natural, sciences the same escape from dogmatism in the wholly positive meaning given to the relativity of the whole product of experience. 27 Weber's critique of the dogmas of naturalism goes to their roots. He wrote: the so-called historical event was a segment of the totality of reality, since the principle of causality which was the presupposition of all scientific work, seemed to require the analysis of all events into generally valid "laws," and in view of the overwhelming success of the natural sciences which took this idea seriously, it appeared as if there was in general no conceivable meaning of sci entific work other than the discovery of the laws of events.28 Weber argues that it is primarily in the natural sciences that the practical evaluative point of view was linked with the hope of reach ing a monistic type of knowledge of all reality by way of general abstractions, a knowledge at once objective and rational. Insofar as German idealist philosophy "since Fichte" opposed the spread of these dogmas, Weber argued that "Among these problems we find the relationship between 'theory' and 'history,' which is still problematic in our discipline."29 In order to understand Weber's methodology it is useful to keep in mind the viewpoint, the "frame of reference," to use a term of his, from which he surveys reality in its historical development. Weber said: The stream of immeasurable events flows unendingly towards eternity. The cultural problems which move men form themselves ever anew and in different colors, and the boundaries of that area in the infinite stream of concrete events which acquires meaning and significance for us, i.e. which becomes an "histor ical individual," are constantly subject to change.30 For Weber it is thus impossible to accept the ideal that the aim of the sciences of culture, as well as those of nature, can be the elab oration of a closed system of concepts in which reality can be con fined in a definitive interconnectedness from which, therefore, it</page><page sequence="29">14 MAX WEBER could also be deduced. In fact, as historical development changes, so too will the conceptual connections on whose foundations it is presented and interpreted scientifically. A closed system of the science of culture, and the definitive identification of questions and areas for investigation, would for Weber be nonsense, or at most lead to congeries of different, separate, points of view. "Reality" is not a monolithic entity, but always appears differ ently and problematically. We must, says Weber, abandon the hope, and consequently the claim, in the scientific field, of under standing and defining reality in its entirety by stipulating laws and modes of development. Tendencies toward the knowledge of the general and the formation of abstract concepts or "law-like con nections" have no scientific justification in the area of sciences of culture. Culture, in Weber's terms, is not an area of study that can be defined once and for all, but rather a grouping of autonomous areas of research which, though they may be interconnected, are related in a way that changes according to the historical development of the various disciplines. Weber's dynamic conception of reality leads him to reject one of the basic, typical assumptions of positivism ? that of not regarding a discipline as scientific if it does not estab lish laws. He, on the other hand, sees the "cultural sciences" as equally scientific as those termed "exact." Sociology itself is basically rooted in an explicit acknowledgment of "cultural sci ences" as "objective" sciences of development. Raymond Aron, with his usual exactness (which nonetheless does not always pro tect him from crude simplifications), points out how Weber's so ciology is progressively distinguished from history: "it is not dis tinguished as a discipline which establishes laws, or as a genuine science as popularly conceived; it is a complementary discipline, defined by another direction of man's desire for knowledge."31 On the other hand, Weber accepts Windelband's distinction be tween natural and historical sciences, in that they tend toward dif ferent kinds of explanation. The former try to enclose the diver sity of phenomena into a system of general laws, while the latter are inclined toward the specificity of phenomena and their analysis within the particular process in which it originates and the rela tion of cause and effect which determine them. In addition, in the historical, and more generally the cultural sciences (Kulturwis senschaften), there occurs an inversion of the method of study in which, for them, nomological knowledge becomes a heuristic in strument instead of being presented as the goal of enquiry. As he</page><page sequence="30">WEBER S INTENT 15 said: MLaws are important and valuable in the exact natural sci ences, in the measure that those sciences are universally valid. For the knowledge of historical phenomena in their concreteness, the most general laws, because they are most devoid of content are also the least valuable." However, there is a unity of the sciences resting on the general observance of the principle of causality as an instrument of knowl edge. This feature is basic both to the logical structure of histori cal knowledge and to that of the natural sciences. Yet it takes on a different form in the two areas, as we shall see later. It is also true that both the natural and the historical sciences aim at the dis covery of concrete relations and the formulation of norms, either as laws or as general concepts in which individual facts are con tained. In this context, we must add to the traditional causal schema based on the causal chain the "conditional" interpretive schema, which tries to ascertain and interpret the conditions pre vailing in the substantiation of the phenomenon being analyzed. It is important to note that all the sciences involved in achieving knowledge of the modifications to which man is subject are cultural sciences, or sciences concerned with describing and interpreting the social action of individuals or groups insofar as it seems to be historically determined. Weber thus sees as impossible any "ob jective" treatment of cultural processes in the sense of reducing the empirical to laws. This is not because cultural or mental pro cesses behave less "objectively" in a rational or "lawful" manner, but because knowledge of social laws is not knowledge of social reality, but rather of one of the many instruments needed for that task. Weber concludes that knowledge of cultural events is inconceivable except on a basis of the signifi cance which the concrete constellations of reality have for us in certain indi vidual concrete situations. And again, restating this fundamental point, he affirms that in the chaos of the theoretically inexhaustible multiplicity of phenomena, order is brought into this chaos only on the condition that in every case only a part of concrete reality is interesting and significant to us, because only it is related to the cultural values with which we approach reality.34 Hence, from the point of view which stands firmly on the ground of methodology, the</page><page sequence="31">16 MAX WEBER circumstance that certain individual components of reality are selected as ob jects of historical treatment is to be justified only by reference to this factual existence of a corresponding interest. 35 He continues: All the analysis of infinite reality which the finite human mind can conduct rests on the tacit assumption that only a finite portion of this reality constitutes the object of scientific investigation, and that only it is "important" in the sense of being "worthy of being known."36 Thus he concludes that the sciences of culture are attempting to understand the phenomena of life in terms of their cultural sig nificance. What exactly does he mean by "culture"? He defines it as "a finite segment of the meaningless infinity of the world process, a segment on which human beings confer meaning and significance."37 In other words, the concept of culture is a "value" concept, and thus the exact sciences, and more generally the sciences of nature, reenter the sphere of culture. Weber is not interested in the event as such, but rather the event as it appears as an individual phenomenon, as a historical but culturally meaningful occurrence. Thus, in the last analysis he is not interested in the individual, the unrepeatable phenomenon or the historically particular in the first instance, but the collective, the repeatable, the multiple ? in a word, the "typi cal" ? which is still in its own way also individual, sociologically individual. In fact, Weber believed that the social-scientific interest has its point of departure, of course, in the real, i.e., concrete, individually structured configuration of our cultural life in its universal relationships which are themselves no less individually structured, and in its development out of other social cultural conditions, which themselves are obviously likewise individually structured.38 Culture in WeberTs sense pertains to a specific context and mode of observing empirical reality, from which it takes on meaning (Sinn or Bedeutung), or becomes culturally meaningful. Culture is thus made up of a mass of historical objects, of isolated ele ments within the complexity of the historically given, intercon nected on the basis of reference to some value on which the task of conceptual selectivity rests. This selective process is decisive</page><page sequence="32">WEBER S INTENT 17 and definitive. Man has no "nature" the way a plant or a rock does. He has, and makes, a history; he lives, realizes himself, and cannot escape history. However, it is a history whose effects are indeed neither taken for granted nor predetermined. It is nothing else but the end result, an ever open and continually occurring cumulative process of human decisions, the sedimentation of the results of consciously reflected choices. Every person every moment makes a gesture which saves or damns him. This is the source of the pathos in Weber's thought. To see in it only the justification of a nonevaluative neutrality and the logical, historical prem ise of nihilism is a polemical interpretation that is hard to sus tain. By means of the concept of culture, or more precisely, of the culturally meaningful, one comes to the heart of Weber's intention, and has come upon the principle of value and all that implies. To Weber, all phenomena are cultural to the extent that their existence and their historical form affect our cultural interests, or arouse our "cognitive drive," directed according to "value ideas" that make a specific part of reality meaningful for us. All knowledge of reality is thus always a knowledge of specific points of view. Every historic object is so classified by virtue of a "relation to values," which corresponds to its cultural significance. There is no "purely objective" scientific analysis of cultural life, and es pecially of social phenomena, "independent of special and 'one sided' viewpoints according to which ? expressly or tacitly, con sciously or unconsciously ? they are selected, analyzed and or ganized for expository purposes. "39 Indeed, the determination that something is meaningful to us "is the presupposition of its becoming an object of investigation."40 Weber explains that there is no characteristic inherent in things themselves which can enable us, in the infinite number of causes that determine a particular phenomenon, to isolate one part of them so that it alone is taken into consideration. The "relation to values" not only makes the object of study meaningful but it is the criterion that allows us to distinguish the object itself. Weber recognizes the need for historical knowledge to refer to values. Regarding the meaning of value relations, Weber paid tribute to Heinrich Rickert's work and wrote that it was sufficient, therefore, only to note that the expression "value rapport" merely represents the philosophical interpretation of the particular science "interest" which determines the selection and formulation of the object of an empirical study.41 He concludes that, to be sure, without the investigator's evaluative ideas, there would be no prin</page><page sequence="33">18 MAX WEBER ciple of selection of subject matter and no meaningful knowledge of the concrete reality. Just as without the investigator's conviction regarding the significance of particular cultural facts, every attempt to analyze concrete reality is ab solutely meaningless, so the direction of his personal belief, the refraction of values in the prism of his mind, gives direction to his work.42 Confronting the problem of the significance of an historical phe nomenon, Weber argues that the process whereby the historian at tempts to isolate the basic historical elements of an event presents us with two perspectives. The first is that after subtracting an in finity of elements, within which one could zealously isolate all eter nity, one would not have made a single step towards the question of what is indeed historically essential in these details.43 The other is that of assuming that no science in the world can, even as its ultimate ideal, set itself the goal of absolutely complete insertion into the causal chain of development. Weber concludes that every comparison in history implies that it is already completed, by way of its relation to natural meanings which, setting aside the infinity of the "general" as well as "individual" characteristics, can deter mine in a positive direction the aim and direction of causal imputa tion.44 Ideas about value direct the work of the researcher, and deter mine what will be the object of study and thus the specification of the conceptual and methodological tools he utilizes in the effective pursuit of the investigation. Their basic characteristic is their being "extraneous to any subjective question," even though this does not imply the conclusion that the products of investigation into the sciences are subjective. "Only the degree to which they interest different persons varies."45 It is clear that the impossibility of a systematic organization of the sciences of culture also reveals the distance of Weber from Rickert's theory of method. For the latter, relationship to values serves as a base for the definitive organiza tion of the conceptual structure of the sciences of culture. If for him, too, the relationship toward values is a principle of choice, then it is also at the same time the absolute guarantee of the valid ity of historical knowledge insofar as the values that operate in making the choice are universal and necessary. Relation to values in Rickert's sense thus performs a double function: to select ob jects relevant to historical science from a given group of facts, and to transcend the tangible universe by means of those values that all sciences accept as valid for attaining knowledge. In Weber, too, relation to values preserves these two functions; but he does not</page><page sequence="34">WEBER 'S INTENT 19 accept that the objectivity of the social or cultural sciences can be based on such a system of universal values. Weber believes that referring the empirical datum to values is no longer an uncondi tional guarantee, as the criteria for choice are no longer universal and necessary but are themselves the result of a choice. This means that, as against Rickert, the determination of the values that allow the cultural sciences to produce authentic knowledge, or make the empirical datum "speak" beyond its pure and immediate given - ness, is no longer valid with reference to a metaphysical principle, even though the tTrelativisticTT interpretation is overly hasty and basically superficial. That validity for Weber is fundamentally guaranteed by the specific orientation of the cognitive interest that guides the investigation, the viewpoint that defines the area. As Aron remarks, in Weber's sociology "the relation to values is a means of subjecting a cultural reality, made up of human desires, to objective study."46 However, it should be noted that for Weber the question cannot be regarded as closed in such a simplistic fashion. The relation to values on which sociological knowledge is based is theoretical and clearly distinguished from value judgment. It is only a princi ple of choice that makes it possible to isolate specific elements within the empirical datum, not a criterion that can evaluate ac tion. In his methodology, the contrast between scientific enquiry and value judgment corresponds to that between value-relatedness and value judgment, in that relation to values is the basis for an analysis of relations between phenomena undertaken on the basis of empirical testing, not the setting-up of normative evaluation. There cannot be a system of values, even formally, as for Rickert, on the basis of which one can discover a system of sciences of cul ture, since the very choice of value as a leading criterion is his torically conditioned, and these values are in mutual conflict. Fur ther, from the moment when sociological knowledge is grounded on a choice by means of which the field of study is mapped out in re lation to the variations in cognitive interests, it becomes impos sible to determine the sphere of a discipline a priori. The cri terion of closed definitions is ended, and the open, operative defi nition is born. If reference to values implies a choice all the same, this means it cannot provide human action with any guarantee of validity. Man decides from time to time, according to the various situations in which he functions, what values to accept or reject. At this point it must be emphasized that for Weber there is a conflict between values ? and not only between the different</page><page sequence="35">20 MAX WEBER "spheres of value," but also within each one. Ethics, for instance, cannot claim to lay down imperatives valid for every field of action and does not even seem able to formulate a system of imperatives coherent in itself. The values according to which individuals align their own moral attitude, and the types of ethics following thereby, are manifold, and conflict is always possible within this multi plicity. Weber said that between values there were no simple al ternatives but a struggle without possibilities of reconciliation,47 and that this is because only on the assumption of belief in the validity of values is the attempt to es pouse value-judgments meaningful. However, to judge the validity of such val ues is a matter of faith. It may perhaps be a task for the speculative interpre tation of life and the universe in quest of their meaning. But it certainly does not fall within the province of an empirical science in the sense in which it is to be practiced here.48 The superficiality of everyday life exists precisely because man is not, and does not want to become, aware of this mixture of hos tile values. However, the fruit of the tree of knowledge, which is distasteful to the complacent but which is, nonetheless, inescapable, consists in the insight that every single im portant activity and ultimately life as a whole, if it is not to be permitted to run on as an event in nature but is instead to be consciously guided, is a series of ultimate decisions through which the whole soul ? as in Plato ? chooses its own fate, i.e., the meaning of its activity and existence.49 Human choice of values on whose basis attitudes are given direc tion occurs between values that appear in mutual conflict, so that to select one or more values always implies the rejection of other values from different spheres, or from the same one. By recognizing the problematic relation between values Weber does not, as it might appear, take up a relativist position, which in deed he rejects. The crudest misunderstanding which in his view the supporters of this "collision of values" are always encountering is that represented by the interpretation of this viewpoint as "re lativism." Even if values are the products of the course of history, this does not provide an obligatory relation between them and the individual historical moment that produced them, and consequently eliminates any influence from a human stand on values. In my view, Weber on the contrary insists on that human choice which can mod ify the relation between human action and values, and that this in any event would be concerned with a "positive" relativism, so to speak.</page><page sequence="36">WEBER S INTENT 21 The ideas about value which determine our action are for him objectively valid, but only for the sphere of our individuality. "Cer tainly, the dignity of the 'personality' lies in the fact that for it there exist values about which it organizes itself."50 In addition, one must at all events believe in values in order to try to formulate others beyond ourselves. In this connection, the empirically demonstrable fact that these ultimate ends undergo historical changes and are debatable does not affect this distinction between empirical sci ence and value judgments... .even the knowledge of the most certain proposition of our theoretical sciences, e.g., the exact sciences or mathematics, is, like the cultivation and refinement of the conscience, a product of culture.51 The concept of value as Weber sees it, as a product of culture and thus relative to man, involves a completely new relation be tween man himself and the world of values. The latter is no longer in existence on its own account, provided with its own, unconditional validity. Rather, this is replaced by a relationship between norma tive criteria, which are valid insofar as they can be realized, and human action. The latter, by choosing between them, determines their validity. What, then, is the meaning of the science based on this new rela tionship, which obviously presupposes both on the methodological level and in its analysis of human action, a human choice of values ? on the one hand as the criteria that guide the research, and on the other as the normative criteria of attitudes? In other words, how can one achieve an "objective" knowledge, valid in the domain of the social sciences ? In the latter, what is the function of the value ideas of the investigator, and how is the relation between in vestigator, and the object to be investigated, structured?</page><page sequence="37">Sociological Objectivity There follow questions that are central for Weber's problematic, but are widely and seriously misunderstood. What is the meaning, for him and us, of sociological objectivity? In other words, in what sense can we speak of sociology as an "objective" science? When the naive positivistic notion of objectivity as the simple existence of facts has been demolished, how may we reconcile concepts and reality? How may we avoid the danger of reification, hypostasizing the two terms, in purely formal heuristic modes of classification for the sake of convenience? How may sociological theory be dis tinguished from the basic theories of society? Is such a distinction tenable? In a word, what is sociology, and what is its use? Is it an impartial relationalization of every decision by eliminating any judgments concerning its merit ? that is, a new instrument of power? Is it a systematic formal construct, with a tendency to closure, able to foresee and take for granted any possible human behavior that is intelligible in the system's terms ? that is, non deviant behavior? Or is it an attempt to establish the meaning of human action insofar as it is potentially endowed with intersubjec tive, and thus rational, validity? Two interpretations of Weber's thought seem to me particularly worth mentioning. These assume directly antithetical positions, but nonetheless both present a characteristic failure of understand ing. The first is Leo Strauss's. He devotes a long chapter in Na tural Right and History to a critical analysis of Weber's position. Strauss maintains that Weber has not only failed to ground and guarantee the objectivity of social science through the meth odological principle of Wertfreiheit, or value freedom, but on the contrary has contributed significantly toward depriving it of its human and social significance. Thus, that he had made it lose the significance of important problems, reducing it to erratic positions 22</page><page sequence="38">SOCIOLOGICAL OBJECTIVITY 23 of absolute ethical relativism. Thus the positive social function of the social sciences was crushed and their cognitive, demystifying charac teristics were repressed by their simple instrumentalization in the service of the powerful of the age, be it by Hitler or by a leader democratically elected and democratically inclined in his deci sions.1 We owe the second definition to Talcott Parsons. He accused Weber of being satisfied by occasional methodological reflections during the living act of research, rather than formulating a com plete methodological system that could validly have guided sociolog ical study by providing it with heuristic models and specific pro jects.2 At any rate, it is just this task which Parsons assigns him self, in order, as he explicitly says, to bring to fruition the work interrupted by Weber as well as by Pareto and D?rkheim. I argue that both Strauss and Parsons are unjust to Weber. The first does not seem to take into account the fact that the criterion of value freedom, or nonevaluation, so strongly established by Weber, helps him ? historically ? as a polemical weapon against those university colleagues, like Treitschke, who used their posi tion to disseminate their own convictions.3 For Weber, the princi ple of nonevaluation was far from being an alibi. It was a means of waging a hard and important battle of ideas against the enslave ment of social science, and especially of sociology, to ideological doctrines and doctrinaire positions that lacked a scientific base in any proper sense of the term.4 As for Parsons's critique, it must be pointed out that this reveals an even more basic misunderstand ing, though we recognize its subtlety and often the un equaled acute ness of his analysis. What Parsons chastises in Weber is his very historical merit: the fact that he clearly rejected the formulation of abstract methodological procedures not associated with concrete research, which might lead to a pseudosociological formalism con stitutionally incapable of understanding the problems of group exis tence in their real uniqueness, that is, their historically determined nature. Weber's position avoids these facile Schemas. He is talking of an objectivity that is not positivist or naturalistic, as those who interpret nonevaluation or value freedom as absolute neutrality seem to believe. Nor can it be reduced to the objectivity of dog matic idealist historicism, which resolves the real, the whole real without any residue, into thought, and ontologically hypostasizes it. Sociological objectivity, and in general that of science, is produced for man in reference to his need to enter into meaningful relations</page><page sequence="39">24 MAX WEBER with the world and other men. It is an objectivity for man himself, concretized not in a relativistic drift but, on the contrary, in taking positions in full awareness, and rationally (scientifically) testing his own potentialities in a given situation. In particular as regards the notion of objectivity, one must never overlook the fact that this task of logical systematization primarily and as usual arises from the concrete foundation of the sciences themselves and their applied methodologies, rather than from a wholly speculative, abstract reflection. There is no intention thus to minimize or even to deny the fact that Weber sought on the the oretical and abstract level a justification for observations born in a problematic closer to the concrete investigations of the sciences themselves. However, this justification too seems to be stamped with the character of the work of the empirical scientist, rather than that of the logician or pure philosopher. The abstract consid erations are never mistaken for absolute ends in themselves. Even terms or ideas that may easily bring to mind typically philosophical (especially Kantian) terms or ideas end up by losing their original meaning and content, that of abstract philosophy, and by remaining linguistic forms that acquire an empiricoscientific content. On the other hand, to consider that Weber's logical forms could already have a preconstituted, or hypostasized, content would mean clearly going aginst his conviction, reasserted to the point of exasperation, that no idea or thought ? in an empiricoscientific sense, of course ? could ever be put forward as true before accurate, rigorous test ing or empirical verification. Besides, even after that they could never claim to contain in themselves a measure of absolute, exclu sive validity. Precisely this is the whole core of Weber's meth odology, insofar as it can be taken as the methodology of a science (social science). Once more, there is in this the confirmation that such logical forms, since they are never to be considered for their own sake, are rather a simple theoretical elucidation of concrete investigation. It is well known that Weber's attitude and logical or methodolog ical polemics have their origins in the German "juridical-histori cal school," the "German school of political economy," and con sequently also, indirectly, in the "Marxist" school and the so called "school of classical economics."5 One can stress here, among other things, that close to the deutsche historische Rechts - schule were men such as Gustav Radbruch, who theorized the cate gory of "objective possibility," and Georg Jellinek, whose close friendship with Weber was the source of many contributions and</page><page sequence="40">SOCIOLOGICAL OBJECTIVITY 25 exchanges of opinion on the basic question of the "ideal type." It is thus fair to stress that a logical method of such importance in volves from the beginning the field of methodology of law and not merely that of Rickert's and WindelbandTs or Dilthey's philosophy, of which generally Weber's thought reminds one. Concerning the historical school of political economy, one should consult especially Weber's Roscher and Knies: The Log ical Problems of Historical Economics ? which must be viewed primarily, despite the many philosophical reflections and those on the history of philosophy, as a clarification of the method of the "cultural sciences," here delineated only in a polemical, and thus negative, mode, one not yet constructive and positive.6 We have already discussed Weber's involvement in the polemic and the clear contrast between the "historical school of political economy" and the school of "classical political economy."7 After leaving the chair of law, in which he replaced Goldschmidt, Weber, still very young, moved to the chair of political economy in Berlin. He had to confront the polemic and take a stand, between Schmoll er and Menger, between the Berlin historical school and the theoreti cal one of Vienna.8 Indeed, this was a polemic concerning the methodology of all the sciences of "culture" in reference to their mutual definition and their distinction regarding the natural sci ences. Weber felt himself facing two excesses: on the one hand, the overestimation of history, and on the other that of abstract theory. In this atmosphere of thought Weber's additional polemics against "historicism," "psychologism," "naturalism," "socialism" or historical materialism, and "positivism" in general, were born. At length, when he finally saw himself basically as a sociologist, all these polemics were reincorporated into that of the radical critique against "sociologism," and in the foundation of the distinc tion between sociology, the other social sciences, and the natural sciences. Each "school" proceeded to a general classification of the sci ences, a cosmology (globus intellectualis) in Bacon's phrase, in order to clarify critically the position of their own science in rela tion to the others. On the other hand, a study of the different meth odologies arose then not only "inside" but also outside (that is, in a general logical-philosophical consideration of the classification of the various disciplines), especially strongly, at that time in Wil helmine Germany, on the part of specialists in logic. During these methodological polemics (which took the global, classic name of Methodenstreit, battle of methods) as might logi</page><page sequence="41">26 MAX WEBER cally be supposed, every methodologist and scientist sought support in the abstract generalizations of pure logicians and philosophers, even while recognizing in a general sense the distance between con crete scientific, or methodological, research and pure philosophical speculation. For Weber, this meant taking a position between these views and at the same time seeking another logical aid, or a methodological position that could guarantee and justify his sociological research. He realized that this meant first establishing at the methodological level what were Mthe logical function and structure of the concepts" and "what is the significance of theory and theoretical conceptuali zation (theoretische Begriffsbildung) for our knowledge of cultural reality?"9 He knew that it was above all necessary to clarify in a critical sense the limits and extent of theoretical-abstract knowl edge as an instrument of social science. In other words, this meant retaining the basic insight of the "classical school of economics," that related to "laws" ?"the fundamental question of the signifi cance of theory in the social sciences."10 Further, in a typically penetrating statement: "The elementary duty of scientific self control and the only way to avoid serious and foolish blunders re quires a sharp, precise distinction between the logically compara tive analysis of reality by ideal types in the logical sense and the value judgment of reality on the basis of ideals."11 However, the danger of formal abstract theory, he warned,, lies in its frequent mistaking of the conceptual instrument for the ob jective of knowledge itself, that is, in the introduction into social science of a wholly naturalistic notion of law, with the inevitable result of making forms, and generalizing, exclusive propositions, absolute. These, instead of arriving at their sole objective in the field of social science, that of instilling order into a disordered reality, would end up by a priori closing social science itself in the face of the understanding and contact of concrete reality. For that reason, Weber always struggled against the spectre of "naturalism." He did this first in order not to repeat Comte's mistake of intro ducing the alien methodological rules of physics into the study of society and thus coming to abstract hypostatizations. Second, he wished to avoid the fallacy of reducing the study of society and its causality to a single determinant factor; that is, to fight sociolog ism along with the methodological, basic positions that, despite their heterogeneity, draw close to it ? psychologism, dogmatic historicism, positivism, and more or less biological evolutionism. One must therefore above all avoid the basic misunderstanding</page><page sequence="42">SOCIOLOGICAL OBJECTIVITY 27 of the "deducibility of reality from 'laws, 12 which logically leads to interpretive Schemas of the social process that are of a monistic kind, basically proof against the needs of a constricted social research and its tests of validity. At the root of Weber's position there is the need to promote and support the notion of "individuality" as the concept that qualifies research in the social or cultural sciences, primarily sociology. What then is required is the reformulation ? correctly this time ? of the ill-conceived notion of the "relation between 'theoretical' and 'historical' work in the context of our discipline" (sociology), or the relation between theoretical-conceptual frameworks (logical instruments) and history (concrete individual reality ? in this case case, individual concrete society). Weber thus mounted a frontal attack against any "monistic knowl edge of the totality of reality in a conceptual system of metaphysi cal validity and mathematical form." From that general standpoint, Weber polemized implicitly against the father of evolutionism: When modern biology subsumed those aspects of reality which interest us his torically, i.e., in all their concreteness, under a universally valid evolutionary principle, which at least had the appearance ? but not the actuality ? of em bracing everything essential about the subject in a scheme of universally valid laws, this seemed to be the final twilight of all evaluative standpoints in all the sciences.13 Thus what is wanted is a criticism of these "laws of general valid ity," or "laws of development" in order to defend individuality in the sphere of the social sciences. Weber's intention is nothing more than a reconciliation of the "theoretical abstract method" and "historical-empirical" research. In other words, as cited above, to reconcile "concept and reality." This means that one must, as a preliminary, examine critically the construction of "generally valid laws" and thus the ambiguity that arises once certain a priori laws are established, consisting of a confusion between "laws" and reality and reality with "laws." In addition, one must oppose both idealism (or Hegelian "panlogism"), which basically identifies the concept with reality, and naturalistic positivism, which likewise ends in a confusion between reality and the concept, at the methodological level. However, Weber believed that although the "abstract theoretical method" may lead to the same confusion of problems as positivism, nonetheless "the propo nents of this method recognize in a thoroughly correct way the method</page><page sequence="43">28 MAX WEBER ological impossibility of supplanting the historical knowledge of reality by the formulation of laws, or, vice versa, of constructing 'laws' in the rigorous sense through the mere juxtaposition of historical observations." 14 Not only from the point of view of method but also from that of concrete "historical-empirical" research, one must maintain as the "first, exclusive distinction" that between "theoretical abstract method" and "historico-empirical research." In idealism this is resolved by hypostasizing the laws themselves as the sole reality. However, what "abstract theoretical method" does not see is the possibility of "mediation," though it maintains a critical distinc tion. The "theoretical abstract" method sets itself up against his torico-empirical research with an unmediated sharpness and seemingly unsurmountably. To escape from the impasse one has to "place in question," or critically reexamine the dogmatic faith in, "generally valid laws," under which is subsumed ? hypostati cally ? reality, along with the monist-naturalist conception of reality. One must, that is, rediscover in Weber the meaning of objectivity, which can be reduced neither to that of positivism nor simply to that of historicism. The misunderstanding of the concept of Wertfreiheit has, tradi tionally for students of the social sciences, deeply compromised a clear understanding of the idea of sociological objectivity. "Value freedom" is never conceived, and is never to be conceived of in Weber, as an absolute freedom, almost a "liberation" from values. Rather, it points to the freedom of one who has achieved a clear, effective knowledge of values and value judgments as distinct from one another ? even if, in my view, they cannot "scientistically" be separated by means of a naturalistically dichotomous formula. Such a person is free to "choose" responsibly any perspective or evaluative point of view precisely because he is conscious of them and tends also to make others aware of them.15 However, Wert freiheit is such only insofar as it allows the social scientist to make use of a freedom of selection or choice (Auslese or Auswahl) as regards any possible "relation of values" (Beziehung auf Werte, Wertbeziehung). He argues: "A chaos of 'existential judgments' about countless individual events would be the only result of a serious attempt to analyze reality 'without presuppositions.' "16 That is, one has to be aware of the "assumptions" of the sci ences of culture. The most important of these is that "a finite part alone of the infinite variety of phenomena is significant" and it has meaning only insofar as it "means" something for us,</page><page sequence="44">SOCIOLOGICAL OBJECTIVITY 29 for the current human condition. He continues: Order is brought into this chaos only on the condition that in every case only a part of concrete reality is interesting and significant to us, because only it is related to the cultural values with which we approach reality. Only certain sides of the infinitely complex concrete phenomenon, namely those to which we attribute a general cultural significance ? are therefore worthwhile knowing.17 Perhaps it is never sufficiently emphasized that neither "value" nor the "idea of value" ever lead Weber to a metaphysical level. These terms simply refer to what is valued, or to what is given credit, or to what one believes "valid" in the sphere of immediate, practical life, which obviously completely lacks reflective or cri tico-theoretical knowledge peculiar to science.18 Now, since it is precisely the cultural sciences which deal with values, or, more precisely, with phenomena in which values are inevitably in volved, these have the task of determining the terms of reflec tive or critico-genetic knowledge as regards values themselves. In Weber's view, this task can only be performed on the basis of a "relationship," that is, "a pure theoretical process of reference of what is empirical to values" (rein theoretischen Vorgang der Beziehung des Empirischen auf Werte).l9 To grasp his argument, going beyond the misunderstandings that push it back to Kantian or neo-Kantian formulas and which, given an interpretation of his ob jectivity as lacking evaluative properties, cannot avoid giving it a crudely naturalistic or positivistic slant, one has to bear in mind the relation of unity /distinction between values and objectivity ? that is, the double function of value. This double function is (a) the value of the experience of practical life, and (b) value incorporated in the formulation of scientific propositions. To assume that prac tical life is the realm of value whereas science is "objective" be cause it is "extraneous" to values, which are replaced by "laws" or scientific "truths," would mean making experience blind, and at the same time would remove from science its essence as a hu man undertaking, reducing it to a gratuitous exercise, perfect and empty of meaning. In addition, Weber remarked penetratingly, "faith in science," or in other words "faith in the value of scientific truth," is not more than the product of particular cultures.20 There is thus no clear break, no dichotomous or problematic separation between science and life. Both have values in common. On the other hand, there is no simple "logico-historical bloc," no confusion between the analytic and the practical instance, between interpretation and action. To invoke a synthesis between life and</page><page sequence="45">30 MAX WEBER science means risking a lapse into an illegitimate romantic posi tion, basically uncritical, unless there is a guarantee of "distance" from the "lived," "clarity" and "distinction" as regards the object of investigation. Such an assumed synthesis risks leading to an empty totalization. "He who yearns for seeing should go to the cinema.. .whoever wants a sermon should go to a conventicle."21 Distrust of "amateurism" in science and of "immediate intuition," which seems to allow one to enter immediately into things but is in reality an illusion inasmuch as it lacks the awareness of being sub jective, is crucial here. In the concept of "nonevaluation" it discovers its outlet and at the same time its rigorous formulation. On that basis a responsible, fully conscious choice is possible for the real individual. That is, the individual can choose responsibility in that no "point of view" can be imposed as scientifically binding from outside, or without taking into consideration his own aims, inter - est, and "point of view." Far from inhibiting, Weber's "nonevaluation" contributes to individual initiative. In particular, as against current interpretations, the concept of nonevaluation cannot properly be s een as the presupposition for an essentially nihilist relativism, just as one cannot derive from it any plausible justification for the neutrality of the sociologist.22 In Weber's terms, to be neutral means to be irrelevant, condemned to nonunder standing, and to be absorbed into the "infinite richness" of reality. The concept of nonevaluation in his epistemology is thus the methodological grasp that permits conscious, that is, rational, com mitment.23 It also marks, in my view, the moment of passing from a still metaphysical rationalism, abstract and deductivist, to an articulated, positive rationalism. This is based on objective or empirically determined knowledge which nonetheless knows that that which it values cannot be empirically, or scientifically (in the traditional sense), demonstrated as a value. In this sense, Weber's concept of nonevaluation is a critical one. His service was that of putting in crisis the philosophical tradition within which rational choices sufficient for the individual in a given historical situation are no longer possible. However, for him there remained a whole series of value assumptions and criteria of eval uation that remained intact and beyond discussion, and which only an inadequately historical reading of his work can see as con sciously relativized by him, or "transitorized" (freedom, justice, honesty in human relations, keeping one's word, sense of honor, the personal worth of the individual, and so on). The probably impassable limit of Weber's thought lies in his not</page><page sequence="46">SOCIOLOGICAL OBJECTIVITY 31 having made these value assumptions or criteria explicit. These not only are isolated from purely individual decisions and the ever lasting, profound conflict between the various value positions on which an individual's choice rests but, more importantly, influence his decisions and ultimately guarantee their meaning and the pos sibility of making them. Obviously, Weber is completely aware of the systematic requirement, indeed the need, for a "conceptual sys tem," which, he states explicitly, we can only produce in order to penetrate the occasional significant elements of reality24; but such a system does not go beyond the strictly methodological level. Just as Marx spoke of "alienation," "exteriorization," and "reification" as regards history, precisely because he felt himself deeply em bedded in it and fully able to understand its course and master its development conceptually, so Weber was equally sure of the eternal stability of the basic value criteria of the European liberal tradi tion, of which he was the legitimate offspring. Thus it seemed to him wholly natural to avoid spelling them out.25 Any other attitude would probably have seemed to him the result of a simple meta physical deposit, or even a useless formula of exorcism. He could not know that the day after his death the monsters would be un leashed.</page><page sequence="47">The Conceptual System For Weber, a conceptual system (Gedankensystem or Gedanken apparat) is simply an attempt Mto bring order into the chaos of those facts which we have drawn into the field circumscribed by our interest."1 To some extent it is thus an arbitrary or "subjec tive" construct. As such it is "critical" insofar as one does not forget its subjective nature and its instrumentality as regards the "chaos of facts," the "infinite multiplicity" of immediately given reality. Its objectivity, and hence its operative autonomy, are in deed linked with its acknowledged "subjectivity." This in turn comes to manifest itself as the differentiating element of social sciences, or sciences of culture, vis-?-vis the natural sciences. "Subjectivity," or the will ? the concrete initiative of individuals who through their historical action transform reality, driven by their interests and aspirations ? guides them by means of their particular "points of view." As Weber says: The intellectual apparatus which the past has developed through the analysis, or more truthfully, the analytical rearrangement of the immediately given re ality, and through the latter's integration by concepts which correspond to the state of its knowledge and the focus of its interest, is in constant tension with the new knowledge which we can and desire to wrest from reality. The prog ress of cultural science occurs through this conflict.2 The progress of the social sciences, or sciences of culture, is thus dependent on the conscious taking on of particular "points of view" on the part of the social investigator, and his "specific re quests," his concrete concerns determined in relation to a reality which left to itself is amorphous and "chaotic." This must be stressed. It involves in a critical sense the two basic conceptions that dominate the field of contemporary social science and reveal its basic, methodological deficiencies: (a) the conception of the closed conceptual system, either at the middle range as in 32</page><page sequence="48">THE CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM 33 Robert K. Merton,3 or fully, as in Talcott Parsons4; (b) the con ception of the progress of knowledge in the social sciences by way of standardization and accumulation of research findings. In fact, these conceptions presuppose in their different ways an essentially immobile social reality which is absolutely intelligible, authoritatively valid. It is translatable, and may be fully expressed (though only gradually and with the right logical-linguistic grasp) by means of the accumulation of partial findings arrived at from time to time, in a complete conceptual system at least tendentially logically closed. It is this claim which Weber destroys. There can undoubtedly be a particular kind of accumulation in the social sci ences. This concerns natural aspects and elements of social phe nomena. However, this should not be taken as equivalent to the whole of the nature of social "reality," which seems on the contrary distinguished by a special type of cumulability, one that is highly problematic. This has to be critically rethought ab imis, and re assessed in every new situation by the standard of the new values ? interests, aspirations, and "points of view." This cumulability is a genuine dialectical movement, by definition not a mechanical but an historical one that rejects juxtapositions and is not simply nomothetic, conventionalist, and "external." In other words, the investigator, far from being neutral, is con stantly called into question: this challenges his very being, in the center of the problem, and this gives meaning and relevance to sociological analysis. In several places Weber stresses the need for the researcher to have at his disposal points of view that are indispensable to determine what is and is not important throughout the research. However, this comes with the warning not to try to construct a complete conceptual system ? not to fall victim to the presumption of thinking history before knowing it ? thereby taking for granted in advance all possible outcomes of the study and thus nullifying it. To avoid any kind of scientistic misunderstanding, Weber argues: "An empirical science cannot tell anyone what he should do ? but rather what he can do ? and, in certain circum stances, what he wishes to do."5 Value judgment regarding a sub ject means my "taking an attitude" in a certain concrete way to the object in its concrete individuality; the subjective sources of this attitude of mine, of my "value standpoints" which are decisive for it, are definitely not a "concept," and cer tainly not an "abstract concept" but rather a thoroughly concrete, highly indi vidually structured and constituted "feeling" and "preference"; it may, how ever, be under certain circumstances the consciousness of a certain, and here</page><page sequence="49">34 MAX WEBER again, concrete kind of imperative (sollens).6 The basic assumption of sociological analysis and the sciences of culture is thus not that we possess a particular culture endowed with value but rather that we are cultural beings, capable of as suming a position vis-?-vis the world, and giving sense to it. This means that for Weber the investigator must not be a tabula rasa but, on the contrary, must have points of view, which are indis pensable, as explained above, for distinguishing what is and is not important in a material world amorphous in itself. By virtue of these ideas about value we isolate in the real world what is meaningful for us. Weber does not conceal the fact that in the sphere of the social sciences various "personal ways of under standing the world" come into play. However, it is not the job of an empirical science to make judgments regarding the validity of these values. Between the level of actual existence, which is rightly that of scientific enquiry, and that of ideal validity, which is properly that of value judgment, there can be no passage, since one would thus meet with arbitrary confusion. For Weber, personal values are a point of departure. Once their initial function has been discharged they must not influence or obfuscate scientific research in any way, even in the area of determining simple causal connections between facts. In his polemic with Eduard Meyer, Weber accused him of simply confusing "valuable" with "causally important."7 It is not by chance that Weber speaks of "feeling" and "seeing" concretely. Indeed, the subject assumes a position vis-a vis reality on the ground of the sphere of ideals ? ethical, aesthe tic, and religious values, ideas about value. These are always rela tive to the subject, and not necessarily mutually harmonious, be cause they are historically conditioned. Weber noted that "Endless misunderstanding and a great deal of terminological ? and hence sterile ? conflict have taken place about the term Tvalue judg ment.'"8 He continues: What is really at issue is the intrinsically simple demand that the investigator and teacher should keep unconditionally separate the establishment of empirical facts (including the "value-oriented" conduct of the empirical individual whom he is investigating) and his own practical evaluations, i.e., his evaluation of these facts as satisfactory or unsatisfactory (including among these facts eval uations made by the empirical persons who are the objects of investigation).9 Independent of the content of this "position taking," the scientific interest of phenomena rests on the cultural meaning they hold for</page><page sequence="50">THE CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM 35 us. Weber says that a specific practical rule, an objective estab lished a priori, may certainly be the presupposition of discussion and enquiry, and thus only discussion of the means for carrying it out would be required. This is indisputable, but precisely in that discussion of means it will become clear that the same aim is de sired on very different grounds. TTn other words, in what sense can the evaluation, which the individual asserts, be treated, not as a fact but as the object of scientific criticism?" 10 Nothing can guarantee that the object of a particular enquiry is worth being known, just as nothing can guarantee that the objectives of a particular technical elaboration have an effective validity. This holds also for the natural disciplines, for physics, chemistry, and biology. These help us technically to master life, but the problem of whether or not all of that has meaning must be either assumed in their aims or completely ignored. The same happens in the social sciences. According to Weber, these tell us nothing about the validity of the object of their en quiry. In the same way, by itself the technical function tells us nothing about the meaning of science. It is the result of verifica tion as regards functional correctness, within its own operations. As for the problem of the meaning of science for man and his place in the universe, it is impotent and has no suggestions to offer. Any discussion of the "worthiness" of practical evaluations, es pecially ethical ones, is thus for Weber out of place in the field of science, as it "belongs among the tasks of social philosophy."11 He does not deny the possibility of a technical critique of value judgments in the sphere of science, but this can lead the investiga tor only to "self-reflection." The social sciences can take on values as their own object only on the factual plane, by considering the relation between means and end implicit in their realization and performing the task of critical analysis on an empirical basis. "To apply the results of this analysis in the making of a decision, however, is not a task which science can undertake."12 The inves tigator will translate the "measurement" of value into decisions on his own account, since this is certainly not the job of science but his personal affair, concerning his will and conscience. The in vestigator weighs and chooses from among the values involved according to his own con science and his personal view of the world. Science can make him realize that all action and naturally, according to the circumstances, inaction imply in their consequences the espousal of certain values ? and herewith ? what is today so</page><page sequence="51">36 MAX WEBER willingly overlooked ? the rejection of certain others. The act of choice itself is his own responsibility.13 The objectivity of the knowledge of the social sciences, as Weber never tired of saying, rests on the fact that "the empirical data are always related to those evaluative ideas which alone make them worth knowing, and the significance of the empirical data is derived from these evaluative ideas. But these data can never become the foundation for the empirically impossible proof of the validity of the evaluative ideas."14 By this, Weber does not seem to wish to ignore the importance of these "supreme values," which are always decisive for the direc tion taken each time by the ordering activity of human thought. However, these represent only the initial stimulus for the research, which must then proceed objectively ? that is, rationally. He clar ifies this: The capacity to distinguish between empirical knowledge and value judgments, and the fulfillment of the scientific duty to see the factual truth as well as the practical duty to stand up for our own ideals, constitute the program to which we wish to adhere with ever increasing firmness.15 The scientist confronted with some particular problem in which different values are involved cannot have recourse to science to make his decisions. According to Weber: In practice, you can take this or that position when concerned with a problem of value ? for simplicity's sake, please think of social phenomena as examples. If you take such and such a stand, then, according to scientific experience, you have to use such and such a means in order to carry out your conviction prac tically. Now, these means are perhaps such that you believe you must reject them. Then you simply must choose between the end and the inevitable means.16 The outcome of science is thus the taking of a conscious position in the face of human action as regards the specifying of the condi tions for testing the values which give significance and sense of direction to that action. Thus, for Weber, political philosophy becomes the methodology of political science, entrusted with the important function of forc ing or at least helping the individual to come to terms with his own appreciation of the matter.17 In his view, philosophy, in dis charging this important responsibility, also places itself at the ser vice of ethics, since it promotes clarity and the sense of responsibility.</page><page sequence="52">THE CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM 37 Weber's science is thus essentially a technical one of means and costs, so arranged, that is, as to foresee the possibilities, limits, and the inevitable consequences, even the undesired ones, of a pro cedure begun in the name of a specific value judgment. Research, and the conceptual system in which it is expressed, seems to be dominated by the initial, and at the same time basic, dimension of choice. Weber takes an obvious risk, that of theorizing a science that has ceased to be one, a science reduced to technique. He fends off this risk by arguing that the dualism of science value judgments does not mean that the empirical sciences should stop when faced with any type of factual evidence at all, while at the same time stressing the problematic character of science. Choice and inten tion: the problematic nature of Weber's methodology rests on these. As we have already pointed out, closed and hypostasized definitions of science are destroyed by them. Every science cre ates its own object and elaborates its own procedural rules without in any way thus returning to the metaphysical plane. Scientific procedure has its own self-justification, the criterion for evaluating its own correctness, and the possibility of an autonomous process of conceptual self-correction on the basis of empirical data meth odically explored. "The specific function of science," concludes Weber, "is just the opposite: namely, to ask questions about these things which convention makes self-evident."18 Just as certain ethical and religious convictions cannot be main tained as "imbued with value" or shared because they are causally highly efficacious, so too with the affirmation of the value of an ethical or religious phenomenon, one does not qualify the enormous consequences its realization has had or might have. "The empiri cal-psychological and historical analysis of certain evaluations with respect to the individual social conditions of their emergence and continued existence can never, under any circumstances, lead to anything other than an 'understanding' explanation."19 Sociology does not console. It can render to politicians and parties only the "inestimable service" of telling them that "(1) these and these 'ultimate' positions are conceivable with reference to this practical problem; (2) such and such are the facts which you must take into account in making your choice between these posi tions."20 It tends, that is, to demystify the taking of positions. However, the question cannot be dealt with so summarily. There are some problems regarding Weber's distinction between "knowing" and "valuing," or judgment of the fact seen as knowledge and value judgment seen as evaluation. How can one know without</page><page sequence="53">38 MAX WEBER evaluating, and vice versa? He seems not to grasp the dialectical link, the connection of reciprocal influence, which necessarily con nects these two moments. That would explain the current interpre tation of a rupture between fact and value as guarantee of the ob jectivity of research, and the Utopian claim, grossly misleading in any case, of an absolute neutrality on the observer's part. In other words, the question is whether we, by way of knowledge, can achieve an ethical transformation. What is sociological knowl edge? Can it really be reduced to a simple question of unmotivated (or idle) curiosity, to use Veblen's formula? Weber himself seems to believe that social science is not without a specific operational efficiency when it formulates a science that, stripped of any pre suppositions, can probe the depths of reality ? especially its more "inconvenient" aspects. Why "inconvenient"? The use of that word cannot be fortuitous. It is probably supposed to mark a possible process of review of social reality. On the other hand, evaluation, while deriving from a function separate from that of "understand ing," is only possible on the basis of science, which is the first to recognize it as its own. In fact, through them one expresses what scientific research is concerned to attain. In a mood of neoromantic fatalism (which should be remembered in the light of contemporary efforts to "positivize" him) Weber ar gues that in every age there exists, and will exist, an insurmount able difference between what relates to our feelings and "ability to be enthusiastic over practical goals or cultural content," and what instead centers on our power and need to order empirical reality conceptually. He is thus aware, and periodically stresses, that without the "point of view," or the individual's ideas of value, themselves the product of a human choice, empirical reality would still be amorphous, and no science would be possible. Both object and method of research are based on human "attitudes." To recog nize the dimension of choice as basic in the process of knowledge clearly involves the further problem of clarifying by what proce dure it is possible to prove a cause-effect relation in its appear ance in a given phenomenon. Weber argued for the infinite multiplicity of elements which lead to the production of a phenomenon and postulated the criterion of choice as the only way of delimiting the field of investigation. Causal explanation is thus delimited and enclosed in a finite series of elements, as the totality of causal elements made up from an in finite multiplicity inevitably escapes investigation. We arrive at the basic problem of grounding the scientific autonomy of sociologi</page><page sequence="54">THE CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM 39 cal investigation. Once a series of relations has been defined by means of a choice, how can one manage to establish that it is these and not others which have determined the given phenomenon? Weber's answer lies in recourse to a system we might call indirect testing, through the use of hypothetical processes or conceptual ideal types, obtained by excluding a specific element from the real process, and which permits a comparison between the real process and the potential process hypothetically constructed. From this comparison it should be possible to establish the cau sal importance of a particular moment in the context of the process under investigation, and to isolate in the multiplicity of the empiri cally given some elements that could be included in a noncontra dictory framework. By this means Weber arrived at the construc tion of his most important heuristic instrument, the ideal type. This was a difficult construction, prepared and made possible through a particular conception of sociology as "understanding so ciology" (verstehende Soziologie), and by resolving the antithesis between "general" and "individual" by means of the notion of the "typical." For Weber, sociology and the conceptual system that guarantees its scientific character manifest themselves characteristically as suspended between nature and history; that is, between a systematic discourse logically closed, standardized and (ahistorically) no mothetic, and the opening toward the unforeseeable and unique, produced by the process of history ? not wholly standardizable and basically ideographic. Sociology is the science of culture, and the reality of Kultur is none other than history, Geschichte, or, more precisely, the history present in it, "history" in the broader sense as "historical life." In contrast to social science, natural science only aims at isolating "general" laws, and is not concerned with "understanding" the individual. Social science on the other hand wants "to understand by explaining" the individual. Weber brings out the fact that our "lived," "intuitive," "evident" life (Erlebnis), abstractions and connections of a conceptual-gen eral type, are always present in an intuitive manner.21 The task of the social scientist lies in explicating the whole of the "intui tiveness" implicit in "experienced" life, to bring it to full "aware ness" (Bewusstsein) of itself. In other words, Weber does not see why social science should not be able to develop clearly the "gen eral" part intrinsic in concrete existence itself. Therefore there is no reason for a sharp contrast between "intuitive" and "con ceptual," even though a distinction must be kept between them,</page><page sequence="55">40 MAX WEBER one that indeed marks out the distinction between life and science ? the latter being simply the conscious development of the "gen eral" component of life itself. It must be remembered that for Weber the "intuitive datum" is the "content" of the concept which it delineates, only one level lower than that of the "critical knowledge" of the concept itself. One sees that this is why the basic problem is what he points to as the logi cal problem of the relation between the concept and its content.22 In the field of cultural sciences, the difference of their logical structure as against that of the natural sciences derives from the basis of values. In the natural sciences "valid laws" are sought and established. On the other hand, in the social sciences, in their "logical" aspect there exists the "conceptual possibility," while in their "effective" aspect there is an "objective possibility" of "test able connections capable of interpretation." While in the natural sciences there is, so to speak, a lawfully valid picture of reality, in the social sciences there is simply an "interpretation" of it. This interpretation involves the "relation to values," the "awareness" of values, which are always manifested in an individual manner. The ultimate aim of the social sciences is thus the knowledge ("consciousness") of these values and the "individual," seen as contents, or as expounded in specific terms of structures and historically determined attitudes. In this respect, it should be pointed out that for sociological analysis, "evidence," or "interpreting the evidential," can only have the weight of an hypothesis or "ideal-typical conceptual forma tion." This is the most interesting feature of Weber's crea tion. In fact, we may see from this, as will be clarified later, that the "typical-ideal concept" does not have the same value as a "natural law," assumed to be universally and necessarily valid and thus incontestable, but is rather one of many "possible evidential interpretations" of reality, with which the concept cannot simplistically, naturalistically be identified. On the other hand, in this regard Weber's analogy between cul tural and natural sciences concerning the categorial-cognitive dual ism of "evidence" and "empirical validity" must be emphasized. The social or cultural sciences can also have "empirical validity," though with all the qualitative differences mentioned above, bearing constantly in mind also that this "empirical validity" is not the same as ? and indeed, as a "psychological," individual element, con flicts with ? the "evidence." To achieve "empirical validity," referral of the phenomenon under investigation to the conceptual system of the researcher ? that is, to his value assumptions ? is essential.</page><page sequence="56">Sociology in Relation to Nature, Biography and History From the standpoint of the evolution of sociological thought, Weber Ts historical merit lies basically in his having restored to the individual the responsibility for choice on the basis of his per sonal interests. After ComteTs socio-centrism and the "factualism" of D?rkheim, and in opposition to the pretentious universalism of the sociology of the "determinant factor," Weber rediscovered the importance of individual decisions and the initially basic function of personal interest. At the same time he tried to repair the frac ture between the sciences of nature and those of culture, made by the romantic tradition. He was the first to grasp that "social facts are not things," that they are unitary realities, both very real and ambiguous. They are mixed realities in flux, more actions in progress than congealed and completed facts, in which contradic tory, standardized and unique, quantitative and qualitative aspects are manifested as mixed together and confused. Seen in this light, they make up the object of the sociology of understanding. The first definition of the "understanding sociology" (verstehende Soziologie) appeared in the 1913 essay "Some categories of 'under standing' sociology." He referred to it also in "The meaning of 'ethical neutrality' in the sociological and economic sciences" (1917), but it is above all elaborated in the posthumous Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, a work published in 1921 but reflected upon and studied in the years 1911-13. What is the task of sociology as a science? At the beginning of Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft Weber states: "Sociology (in the sense in which this highly ambiguous word is used here) is a science concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social ac tion and thereby with a causal explanation of its course and conse quences."1 Further on he says that "the specific task of sociologi cal analysisorof that of theother sciences of action, ... is the inter 41</page><page sequence="57">42 MAX WEBER pretation of action in terms of its subjective meaning."2 The most interesting element, the real "understanding" of sociology, con cerns this "action in terms of its subjective meaning." One arrives at an "understanding" of what Weber describes as "subjectively intended" or "subjectively referred" meaning by means of "gener alizations from experience." What is involved here is the "under standing" of connections of meaning ? that is, the comprehension (Verstehen) of an intelligible "sequence of motivation," clarifica tion (El&gt;kl?ren) of which can serve as "an explanation of the actual course of behavior." Thus, "explanation" ? in a discipline concerned with the meaning of behavior ? requires that the researcher under stand the Sinnzusammenhang, the "connectionof meaning, "the "com plex of meaning in which an actual course of understandable action thus interpreted belongs."3 The object of "understanding" sociology is thus an "action" en dowed with a "subjectively referred meaning." This action is none other than the action of "individual persons." (Further on in fact we read: "But for the subjective interpretation of action in so ciological work these collectivities must be treated as solely the resultants and modes of organization of the particular acts of in dividual persons, since these alone can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action.") Only individuals can give "subjective meaning" to social action, which thus, being the action of individuals, is itself individual and always manifest in a singular manner. However, while this social behavior does indeed have a meaning subjectively related to certain individuals, it is naturally social in that it is "directed toward the past, pres ent or intended future of other individuals."4 The "interpretive understanding" of sociology is directed toward the "meaning, "or "the average of, or an approximation to, the actually intended meaning." 5 Social science is distinguished from natural science in that its subject matter is not nature but society, not the objective but the subjective, not the mechanically standardizable but the nonrepeat able, not an immobile, fixed structure but the behavioral variable, action; not the unrelated but the related and the relationship. How ever, social science and natural science do have one thing in com mon: both impose order on their objects through general concepts. Insofar as they propose themselves valid for everything, as con ventions of abstract thought, these general concepts permit univer sal agreement. However, to clarify, one stresses that this is above all a clarity and awareness of the nature, limits, and logical and cognitive scope of these concepts; and thus the possibility of</page><page sequence="58">SOCIOLOGY 43 disagreement and polemics, though always on a plane both critical and clear for all. By virtue of these cognitive means sociology is presented as a science, as valid as any natural science. There is thus a difference in subject matter; however, this does not mean total heterogeneity on the logical level. The means are the same (concepts), but the aims are different. While for natural science, concepts and general laws are ends in themselves or are identified with the end of research itself, in sociology (as for all the sciences of "culture") they are instruments for attaining the subject matter ? that is, social action in its specific configuration. Sociology helps us to acquire a clear awareness of social reality with all its historical implications, and thus also of the past as well as the present and future, though always in relation to con temporary, actual implications. Of course, full understanding of the latter also involves that of the past, history as historiography. However, if history cannot provide us with a scientific, detached view of the present, either for want of specific investigatory tech niques or of a critical "distance" from it, sociology may be suc cessful in this. For this reason too, one cannot say that Weber takes sociology to be a science auxiliary to historiography. Weber's constant referral to "in der Gegenwart" (in the present), his continual reference to contemporary social issues in his sociolog ical studies (these indeed always aspire to be a function of today and today's society; see, for example, this expression in the essays in Religionssoziologie), confirm my interpretation. They also demon strate that when Weber speaks of history and historiography, he is really talking about history in the "broader sense of the term," in the sense of "historical life." This expression broad ens the scope of "history" to make it coextensive with the "re ality" to be studied, which in turn is Kultur, to be explained according to the understanding of its internal connections and genesis. Historiography, on the other hand, is a distinct, autonomous sci ence, which, like sociology, may be included in the area of the other sciences of "civilization" and also shows some connections with them. However, Weber is principally concerned with estab lishing the relations and differences between historiography and sociology. Both aim at "interpretive understanding" ? the former, of the meaning and connection of the meaning really intended in the particular case, and the latter (as already noted), of the meaning or connection of meaning on the average, approximately.6 "We have taken for granted that sociology seeks to formulate type con</page><page sequence="59">44 MAX WEBER cepts and generalized uniformities of empirical processes. This distinguishes it from history, which is oriented to the causal analy sis and explanation of individual actions, structures, and person alities possessing cultural significance."7 One should not be taken in by the mistaken interpretation of this passage whereby there is almost a theorization of a contrast be tween sociology and historiography in terms of the contrast be tween the "general" and the "individual," according to a contempo rary interpretation of the relation between history and sociology. We have in fact already seen that sociology too is a "science of individual reality," and thus aims at the explanation and "under standing" of reality. As we have mentioned, one can only say that if it is true that "concepts" or the "general rules of development" are rightly those of both types of science, they are elaborated directly and according to specific techniques only by sociology, which aims at understanding individual, singular reality, inasmuch as "The empirical material which underlies the concepts of so ciology consists to a very large extent, though by no means exclu sively, of the same concrete processes of action which are dealt with by historians."8 Thus sociology provides the "laws," the awareness and "unequivocalness" of concepts, to the "historico causal knowledge of phenomena of cultural importance." Why, then, is sociology able to elaborate these "laws" or "con cepts"? Whence this unusual privilege? Basically it is because in sociology's systematic approach one finds a distinction between the two meanings of "general," or "allgemein," namely (a) in the sense of "general" concept, hence with a logical value, better ex pressed in the German "generell," and (b) in the sense of "univer sally valid," that is, of the unconditional "universal" validity of values, well expressed in the German "universell," and thus of "normative" value. Sociology indeed is concerned with discovering "within the realm of social action certain empirical uniformi ties. .. , that is, courses of action that are repeated by the actor or (simultaneously) occur among numerous actors since the sub jective meaning is meant to be the same."9 The true subject mat ter of sociology is indeed marked by this "homogeneity," the "uni versal" referral or relation to "norms" and "values." Clearly, history and sociology have two points in common (the concept, and the subjective, or individual or "intended meaning," to be understood differently, however, in the two disciplines), which end up interfering in the logical process of "understanding" (or interpreting) by explaining the actually intended meaning for</page><page sequence="60">SOCIOLOGY 45 concrete historical action.10 "Both for sociology in the present sense, and for history, the object of cognition is the subjective meaning complex of action."11 As for historiography, this is concerned with "the average of, or an approximation to, the actually intended meaning."12 The elaboration of general concepts is, however, a logico-instru mental question that concerns both disciplines. Sociology gives us the "homogeneous," the "typical," while historiography provides the "individual." From an abstraction, the concept is derived as a logical tool to penetrate and grasp the realities studied by his toriography as well as by sociology. Sociology, like historiography, works out and uses a system of concepts. Both sciences also have a common subject matter ? social action and human initiative ? in their specific historical determination. However, these basic common characteristics can not justify any summary reduction of one to the other. The reduc tionist claim, as I have had occasion to remark elsewhere,13 is the result of a misunderstanding. This involves on the one hand a con ception of sociological analysis that is still Comtean in nature, systematic in the omnicomprehensive sense, which puts itself for ward logically as the "science of sciences"; and on the other, his torical research that actually coincides with the whole of man and all his possible creations, or all reality. The latter is seen as raised up in the various phases of its development into the supreme manifestation of absolute spirit. Sociology as a closed system has for some time now yielded in the face of the demand for specific social investigations centered on circumscribed and scientifically relevant phenomena. Something analogous has happened in the case of historicism, with new critical demands to do justice to the com plexity and basic indeterminateness of the human world, to make absolute the moments of time in which the absolute spirit might mate - rialize; a founding characteristic of romantic-idealist historicism has been eaten away at the roots. That is, it presents itself as both the conclusion and the closure of the course of history, and at the same time argues, at once contradictorily, for the need of transcending what it affirms, on the basis of that very proposition which should be negated.14 Once this reduction of sociological analysis has been digested into the context of historical development, sociology takes on a purely instrumental value while at the same time it loses any really cognitive value. It is demoted to a convenient system of classification. As Antoni usefully reminds us, "as earlier for</page><page sequence="61">46 MAX WEBER Vico, for Croce too the only form of knowledge was historical knowledge."15 The other sciences did not provide knowledge; at the most they could provide classes and laws useful for summariz ing experience for practical purposes, and for cataloging phenom ena. The bias towards totality is basic and helps to explain the ten dency to reductionism. This bias has found a particularly skillful critic in Karl R. Popper.16 He notes that there is a basic ambi guity in the use of the word "whole." In fact, the term is normally used in two senses. The first indicates the totality of all the prop erties or aspects of something, and especially all the reciprocal relations between its constitutive parts. The second points to some special properties or aspects of the thing in question ? that is, those that make it appear as an organized structure rather than a mere conglomeration. In this second sense, the term has been used as an expression of a key concept by psychologists of the form, or Gestalt. For them, the objects possessing such an orga nized structure are something more than the sum of their parts. The ambiguity of total or global conceptions, which by definition tend to ingest all of reality in certain Schemas without leaving any thing behind, rests basically on the confusion between the two senses.17 In these conceptions, the two meanings of the term "whole" are used interchangeably. In other words, while one recognizes that every scientific analysis is necessarily selective, and thus is unable to consider all aspects and properties of a given thing or phenomenon, one nonetheless tends on the other hand to present the analysis of the "whole," viewed as a group of meaning ful aspects and not all aspects of the thing, as though in fact it were the positive, conclusive inclusion of all the known characteristics making up a given historico-social phenomenon. It is thanks to this logical leap that it is possible to speak of absolute historicism and that to consider totality as an object of scientific analysis, both from a sociological and a historiographic point of view, is ex pressed as a new theology. The collaboration between sociology and history may, in this re gard, be presented not only as a natural consequence of the princi ple of division of labor between neighboring disciplines, but also as a useful antidote to the conception of history as a flux of happen ings, endowed with automatic organizational powers, something necessary and necessitating. For such a conception, precedent and consequent are justified in so absolute a way as to leave no margin for unforeseeable individual initiatives and to allow of no recogni</page><page sequence="62">SOCIOLOGY 47 tion of biographical data. On the other hand, there is no doubt that personal documents and autobiographies may, for the historian and sociologist, constitute empirical material that is fundamental for purposes of description and interpretation. As for sociology, much time has elapsed since the era when Thomas and Znaniecki argued: We are safe in saying that personal life-records, as complete as possible, con stitute the perfect type of sociological material, and that if social science has to use other materials at all it is only because of the practical difficulty of ob taining at the moment a sufficient number of such records to cover the totality of sociological problems, and of the enormous amount of work demanded for an adequate analysis of all the personal materials necessary to characterize the life of a social group.18 I have noted elsewhere that Thomas's and Znaniecki Ts monumental work ? though its limitations are obvious in light of the criticisms of Herbert Blumer and other scholars ? may still constitute a valid example of the use of personal documents on a huge scale. Thomas in the United States and Znaniecki in Poland were able to collect, put in systematic order, and then publish seven hundred and sixty-four letters, focusing their attention on the changes and adjustments imposed on primary groups of Polish peasants by the process of industrialization, their gradual proletarianization, and finally the emigration of relatives. Critical analysis of the letters, autobiographies, and other personal documents produced results of great interest from a substantive point of view, which have not, however, escaped the expression of severe reservations from the methodological point of view. Among others, Herbert Blum er ob served that the autobiographical material and the letters and docu ments of various kinds that Thomas and Znaniecki collected cer tainly helped to back up ? and to some extent better to define ? their theoretical propositions and hypotheses. However, one cannot argue that empirical material of this kind can prove these propo sitions and hypotheses in any way. In other words, Blumer argues that the autobiographical material collected only complemented the knowledge the authors already possessed about the world of the Polish peasant and about the effects of emigration and industrial ization on preindustrial human groups. 19 In my view, the use of autobiographical material and personal documents as spontaneous, first-person descriptions of the experi ences, beliefs, and actions of an individual, is of great importance in casting light on the background of a problem or particular social</page><page sequence="63">48 MAX WEBER phenomenon, situating it in its correct perspective; and, further, in focusing the theme of research and laying out the basic, quanti tatively measurable data that will be included in the formulation of the hypothesis to be tested. In this sense, autobiographical mate rial and personal documents are precious, even indispensable, for "background research," in that they provide indications of behavior and attitudes that may be expressed in rigorous terminology, which lends itself to classification and quantitative testing.20 Autobiographical material thus constitutes a body of primary data which, in the economy of research, has a basic function. It is in fact true that a highly elaborated statistical analysis can in some cases lead to the mathematical determination of interesting correlation indices between very dissimilar empirical variables: only mathematical instruments can unearth these, giving rise to new, significant hypotheses. However, it is rather rare to create hypotheses on the basis of correlation indices. These indices in fact, for the most part, help to test hypotheses already formulated according to the general model of probability theory. The auto biographical element brings sociology back to a discourse that in certain significant ways is naturalistic. In fact, autobiographies make important tendencies "break through" the raw magma of un differentiated behavior. As Harold D. Lasswell rightly observes, "The life history is a natural history, and a natural history is concerned with facts which are developmentally significant."21 The question sociological analysis then faces is that of deter mining a nonarbitrary periodization of a life history viewed in such a way as to see its principal periods of development and identify its characteristic matrices of behavior. What makes the greater part of autobiographies and life histories collected by sociologists meaningless, if not scientifically misleading, is precisely this lack of heuristic concern. Autobiography thus be comes presented and evaluated as a suggestive tranche de vie, in teresting for its curious or exceptional characteristics rather than its heuristic value, and rarely free from a second-rate literary tone. Such a result is largely inevitable when life histories are not collected with attention to the economic, social, and cultural context in which they are placed. However, this awareness is im possible if the researcher does not hold a theory of personality that can provide the essential points of reference to describe and understand the complex, interwoven body of relations that bind the biography of an individual ? seen as the meaningful record of his development ? to the basic characteristics of his personality and</page><page sequence="64">SOCIOLOGY 49 also to the family and other primary social groups to which he be longs as well as to the broader framework of the institutional structure of the society in which he lives. Without this integrated approach it appears difficult to avoid one or another of the classic fallacies that have marked the development of sociology. On the one hand, we have a macrosociological, structural analysis, by definition unable to grasp the meaningful psychological element, and thus continually exposed to the danger of pseudo-systematic formalism. On the other, we have sociological research concerned with collecting and evaluating individual behavior, but basically unable to provide us with anything more than a gallery of carica tures, if not indeed the dilution of every real sociological problem into a series of psychologistic formulas, basically unverifiable and arbitrary.</page><page sequence="65">The Ideal Type Weber used a specific conceptual instrument to permit sociology to grasp the unique, characterizing element of social action in the framework of the structures that condition it institutionally and historically: this is the "ideal type." The theory of the "ideal type" is the supreme moment in Weber's methodological thought, the instrument used in his famous studies; yet, at the same time, it brings out unresolved difficulties, ambiguities, omissions, and con tradictions. Talcott Parsons, among others, has capitalized on the traditional criticisms leveled against Weber. What are "ideal types"? Is it enough to define them as points of reference or as deliberately emphasized aspects of human behavior? Are we dealing with an experimental category drawn out by empirical research, or a con cept properly so-called, and thus provided with its own internal, rigorous logic? If it is only an instrument, how can it be elabo rated? If "type" has the aspect of uniformity and repeatability, what does "ideal" mean in this context? Can it be understood as "rational" or "abstract," or does it mean "desirable"?1 As it is impossible to find exhaustive responses to such questions in Weber, Parsons finds confirmation for his own conviction as to Weber's insufficiently systematic nature ? seeming not to realize that he is reproving Weber precisely for his real merit. For Weber, in fact, the conceptual apparatus of sociology must be capable of grasping the "typical" or "homogeneous" element in historical phenomena in order to deal with them scientifically ? that is, to provide an "explanation" or "causal imputation." How ever, a logic or methodology of concepts cannot serve this purpose, as this simply repeats the traditional principle (Aristotelian in origin) genus proximum ? differentia specifica, characteristic of "axiomatic disciplines which use syllogisms."2 50</page><page sequence="66">THE IDEAL TYPE 51 It is therefore necessary to establish a new method capable of guaranteeing the designation "sciences" to the disciplines of cul ture, especially sociology. Weber confronts this requirement by constructing "ideal types." Ideal types are "conventional types" (that is, established abstractly and conventionally), "clear and understandable by reference to an ideal type."3 They are intelli gible because one sees in them a conscious contact between "un derstanding" (verstehen) and "experiencing" (erfahren), here syn onymous with "explanation" (erkl?ren), between "value" and "con cept," between tThaving to be" (or tThaving to behave") and em pirical "being." First, however, it is necessary to specify the sense in which the ideal-typical concept, by way of which one obtains a synthesis of "objective" and "subjective," "general" and "individual," passing through the plane of the "typical," is really "ideal." In fact, there are in Weber two meanings of "ideal" ? a normative and a logical one. The qualification of "typical concept" by "ideal" has only a logical value, in that it is presented as abstract from the reality of which "values" and "norms" ? that is, "having to be" ? are part. tfIdeal types," however, aim at showing only "what is" on the empirical level, not "what should be." If "values" enter into their consideration, they enter only by way of the checking and "distance" of what Weber describes as the "technical critique of values." In other words, this is the "knowledge" or "awareness" at which empirico-objective science aims and whose "ideal-typi cal" concepts are the instruments and means of investigation. As Weber says: "the scientific treatment of value-judgments,... of these ultimate standards, which are manifested in concrete value judgments to the level of explicitness is the utmost that the sci entific treatment of value-judgments can do without entering into the realm of speculation."4 As an example of the "ideal" contrasted with the "real" one could take "commander," and set up a "type" who could act "without error" in a given situation if he had a "representation" and "knowl edge" of it that was ideally, logically, and rationally coherent. A comparison between the given "general situation" and the "ideal typical construction" (the "type" of the commander) could give us the differences between them, as well as the extent of the "ap proaching" (Ann?herung) or approximation of the "real" action of the commander to that of the "ideal-typical construction." To clarify the nature of the relation between "value" (or "norm"</page><page sequence="67">52 MAX WEBER as evaluative "ideal") and "ideal-type concept," it would be useful to read the passage in the Wissenschaftslehre where Weber asserts that "the term 'value' ? that unfortunate child of misery of our science ? can be given an unambiguous meaning only as an ideal type."5 When one is faced with a given reality, it is obvious that in order to see it in a "distanced" manner one can take up various points of observation, from which other different perspectives, all partial and nonexhaustive, are revealed. On the other hand, in order to formulate a hypothesis about the nature and real causal value of a given phenomenon, one must proceed by way of various "ideal-typical" perspectives, that is, "unilateral" ones insofar as they are abstracted from the complete reality of the phenomenon in question. Indeed, the ideal type is not a hypothesis but rather tends to formulate or suggest hypotheses. Obviously, from a "unilateral" point of view one "stresses" cer tain "features" or "elements" and passes over others as secondary. In other words, some features are isolated from a context or com plex of elements. As a result of this process of "isolation" and "abstraction," some connection is established between the "isolated" or "stressed" features and certain of their relationships ? whence, from a "unilateral" point of view, there is produced what Weber describes as an "ideal frame," "model," or abstract "schema," i.e., one that is a "utopia," "unreal" in that it is partial and also a "heuristic means" to understand a reality that itself is much more complex and polyvalent than the "fantastic picture." This "ideal frame" or "model" gives us a "genetic definition of the content of the concept."6 It is not reality, but aims at its un derstanding. Its goal is to illustrate and make pragmatically intel ligible the specific character (Eigenart)7 of a particular phenome non. The sociologist can obtain this only by elaborating various unilateral "ideal-type concepts" constructed from different points of view, since the discursive nature of our chain of intellectual modifications postulates such a conceptual shorthand.8 The ideal type is a conceptual construct (Gedankenbild) which is neither historical reality nor even the "true" reality. It is even less fitted to serve as a schema under which a real situation or action is to be subsumed as one instance. It has the signifi cance of a purely ideal limiting concept with which the real situation or action is compared and surveyed for the explication of certain of its significant com ponents.9</page><page sequence="68">THE IDEAL TYPE 53 With respect to the ideal type, we can establish the measure of the "deviation" (Ablenkung or Abweichung) of reality from the "type," or its approximation to it. The advantage of the "ideal typical concept" lies in the clarity it offers, as it aims at providing representation with a univocal means of expression. It has the advantage of a clear, critical terminology insofar as it is univocal. But how is the "ideal type" constructed? An ideal type is formed by the one-sided accentuation of one or more points 01 view and by the synthesis of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less pres ent and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are ar ranged according to those one-sidedly emphasized viewpoints into a unified analytical construct (Gedankenbild).10 It is clear, therefore, that the "ideal type" is a heuristic means for the purpose of investigating a certain type of phenomenon and is oriented in a particular "direction"; it is valid until the need arises to elaborate a better one, i.e., one that better corresponds to the needs of the researcher. In fact, these "ideal-typical concepts" have the advantage of "univocality of the conceptual content," but they vary as "our sci entific interest" varies and with the change in the "meaning" of our "relationships to values." They do not propose anything other than the critico-genetic investigation of values and their relation to the historical world and preconstituted "methodological knowledge," or the complex of "general empirical rules" or "rules of experience" already known, the known ideal types, valid and accepted. Determining the ideal type for Weber is thus tied to emphasizing a given aspect of empirical reality at the expense of others, a process of "utopian rationalization" that avoids the generalization of common features. The ideal type is thus something other than empirical reality, though it appears in relation with it as the instru ment of explanation of phenomena in their individuality. Weber cites as an example the idea of "urban economy." Here is an ideal type reached not by making a selection of the economic principles that actually obtained in the cities observed, but rather through unilateral emphasis on certain points of view and through the joining together of specific phenomena corresponding to those points of view, enclosed in a conceptual framework unitary in it self. Because of its abstract character this conceptual framework appears as a utopia, since in all its purity it cannot be located in reality. According to Weber,</page><page sequence="69">54 MAX WEBER It is a conceptual construct (Gedankenbild) which is neither historical reality nor even the "true" reality. It is even less fitted to serve as a schema under which a real situation or action is to be subsumed as one instance. It has the significance of a purely ideal limiting concept with which the real situation or action is compared and surveyed for the explication of certain of its significant components.11 He argues that for a "representation" the use of such concepts is indispensable, even if our "fantasy" can dispense with them. Syn theses of historically operative ideas such as "liberalism," "meth odism," or "socialiam" have an ideal-typical nature, which we elaborate on the basis of fundamental directing principles, and which have come to us only in an incomplete form, without clear conceptual connections. According to Weber: All expositions, for example, of the "essence" of Christianity,are ideal types enjoying only a necessarily very relative and problematic validity when they are intended to be regarded as the historical portrayal of empirically existing facts. On the other hand, such presentations are of great value for research and of high systematic value for expository purposes when they are used as conceptual instruments for comparison with and the measurement of reality.12 The language spoken by the historian, he continues, by reason of its need for discursive clarity, expresses these conceptual frame works in hundreds of words. Weber takes the battle of Marathon as an example of the use of ideal types in historical research. This battle decided between two possibilities: on the one hand the development of a religious theoretical culture under the aegis of a Persian protector, and on the other the victory of the Hellenic spiritual world, for which it represented the indispensable precondition. Without evaluating this possibility it would be impossible to understand the phenome non, and "there would in truth be no reason why we should not rate that decisive contest equally with a scuffle between two tribes of Kaffirs or Indians."13 Already, the first step toward historical judgment is one of abstraction, of analysis and conceptual isolation of empirical elements. "Even this first step thus transforms the given 'reality1 into a 'mental construct' in order to make it into an historical fact. In Goethe's words, 'theory' is involved in the 'fact.'"14 For Weber, the historical significance of a fact is not established by the setting out of what the historian finds before him. The fact</page><page sequence="70">THE IDEAL TYPE 55 acquires validity only insofar as it adds to reality the patrimony of our knowledge, our nomological type of experience, on the basis, that is, of a conceptual framework, abstraction in the double sense of isolation and generalization. The sociologist too, like the historian, uses these conceptual frameworks; but "theoretical concepts of sociology are ideal types not only from the objective point of view, but also in their application to subjective processes."15 In fact, sociology tries to formulate and express in theoretical concepts even ir rational, mystical, and affective phenomena. "In all cases, ra tional or irrational, sociological analysis both abstracts from reality and at the same time helps us to understand it, in that it shows with what degree of approximation a concrete histor ical phenomenon can be subsumed under one or more of these concepts."16 Real action generally develops in semi-consciousness of its "in tentional meaning." The individual agent is mostly instinctive, or acts from habit, save in sporadic cases of homogeneous mass ac tion. Effectively aware and clear action is for Weber the ultimate case. Nonetheless it is the task of sociology to elaborate its con cepts by way of explanation and classification of the possible inten tional meaning, as if action was in fact proceeding in a consciously oriented manner. This does not mean that the theory of the ideal type presupposes the rationality of the world. Rather, by using the theory, the re searcher approaches concrete reality as nearly as possible, re vealing the irrational deviations and the causes that determine them as they interfere in the ideal rational operation. Weber ex plains: "We should emphasize that the idea of an ethical impera tive, or a 'model* of what 'ought* to exist is to be carefully dis tinguished from the analytical construct, which is 'ideal* in the strictly logical sense of the term."17 This, consequently, does not give rise to a new break between the ideal types of pure rationality and concrete historical material. For Weber, the construction of "conceptual frameworks" is not dangerous for the purposes of un prejudiced research, since it is not an end but a means of research. However, one must take care that the ideal type not be ascribed empirical validity (as is the tendency) invading the sphere of inter pretation and thus becoming a value judgment. An ideal type has no connection with "perfection" save in the purely logical sense, and it is independent in relation to evaluative judgment. To the extent that the ideal type relates to historical "individualities," it</page><page sequence="71">56 MAX WEBER has the function of revealing typical features in general character istics. Its application should further clarify any confusion, in the field of reality, between the idea and the ideal of any historical fact. Weber gives as an example the ideal-typical construction of the phenomenon "liberalism." We may regard the liberal phenomenon either as a political regime or as a human attitude; that is, we may construct an ideal type of the "idea" or of the "ideal" of liberalism, and hence gain knowledge of the distinction in the sphere of ideal conceptions between how they were thought of by men in the past and our own current ideal types. Once more, it is Weber's concern to distinguish clearly between the spheres of being and of what should be. The concern rests on the fact that Weber is wholly aware that the distinction is precari ous. Faced with the danger that conceptual frameworks may be transformed into value judgments, Weber warns: "the elementary duty of scientific self-control and the only way to avoid serious and foolish blunders requires a sharp, precise distinction between the logically comparative analysis of reality by ideal types in the logi cal sense and the value judgment of reality on the basis of ideals."18 Ideal-typical formulations should not contain, con sciously or otherwise, ideals to which the researcher refers the facts studied, for purposes of valuation. But is this possible? When he argues that the way these syntheses are made ? the way contemporaries in various historical periods construct their ideas ? is of eminently practical importance, Weber seems to stress the Utopian nature of his distinction. In several places he observes how the practical idea in which one believes, insofar as it is valid or should be valid, and the theoretical ideal type constructed for cognitive purposes, draw near and tend to be transformed into each other. For example, ideal types can be concerned with lines of develop ment, but precisely from that there arises the danger of confusing ideal type and reality. For this reason, he stresses, in order not to confuse theory and history, or even conflate them, one must rigorously maintain the distinction between ideal-typical construc tion (which permits us systematically and validly to refer a his torical process to its causes) and history itself. The ideal-typical concept is thus a "unitary framework," "imag inary," logically constructed on the basis of the principle of "non contradiction." "This conceptual framework joins determinate relations and determinate processes of historical life in a cosmos</page><page sequence="72">THE IDEAL TYPE 57 of conceptual connections, without contradiction."19 This too shows the "unreality" of ideal-typical concepts, which present only some abstract "analogies" and are based on a logic of "as if" (als ob).20 Nonetheless, it might be possible that an "ideal type" could be con cretely verified; but that is highly improbable and must be estab lished each time. If, as we have said, ideal types have as their purpose knowledge of individual reality not only in its specific elements but also in the connections between these, that is, their causal and historical re lations, then we must clarify how the process of "causal imputa tion" (in which the system of ideal types originates and toward which it tends to move) develops. When we speak of these "con nections" we move from consideration of simple ideal-type ele ments to ideal-typical links between them, which means that from simple "ideal types" we move to "relations between ideal types." What is presented to the sociologist as an object of knowledge is, as we have seen, the tfworld of culture as historically given." This involves knowing concrete "historical individuals," the con crete forms of given historical reality. As Weber says, for knowledge of reality we must refer to the constellation in which the elements of reality are to be found, "ideal-typically" presented and gathered into a cultural phenomenon that is historically mean ingful for us. If we wish to explain this individual grouping causally, we must always refer to other groupings, equally individ ual, as a basis for explanation ? naturally, through the use of ideal-typical concepts. Once certain "laws" have been established by ideal-typical methods (that is, those that make up "nomological knowledge"), and certain factors have been discovered by ideal typical means, the establishment of those laws and factors is in every single case the first of the many operations that lead us to knowledge. "The analysis of the historically given individual con figuration of those 'factors' and their significant concrete interac tion, conditioned by their historical context and especially the ren dering intelligible of the basis and type of this significance," is the second task of scientific knowledge, which "must be achieved, it is true, by the utilization of the preliminary analysis but.. .is none theless an entirely new and distinct task."21 In other words, a certain "nomological knowledge" is given in the science of culture, but it must not be taken as an absolute. Fur ther, insofar as it helps us to know analytically "a historically given individual group," it is multifunctional, provisional, and ab stract. The third task lies in the return to the specific individual</page><page sequence="73">58 MAX WEBER characteristics of such groupings as are meaningful for the pres ent, going back into the past as far as possible, and in "their his torical explanation by antecedent and equally individual configura tions." The fourth task consists in "the prediction of possible fu ture constellations."22 To clarify the method of development of the process of "causal imputation," one must first grasp the meaning of the categories "adequate causation" and "objective possibility." The scientist asks himself: "How in general is the attribution of a concrete ef fect to an individual 'cause' possible and realizable in principle in view of the fact that in truth an infinity of causal factors have conditioned the occurrence of the individual 'event.1 "23 Further on he says: "The possibility of selection from among the infinity of the determinants is conditioned, first, by the mode of our his torical interest." This involves, then, "causally imputing" only those "elements" or "aspects" that from specific points of view offer a "universal meaning"; that is, "essential elements." Thus, causal imputation involves a "series of abstractions." In fact, finding these "essential elements" really means selecting some that are interesting from our points of view and passing over others. Essential elements thus become "causally relevant" for us. The "ideal-typical concept" really is involved in a "series of abstractions" of this kind. The sociologist merely continually formulates "judgments concerning possibilities."24 In order to establish the "causally relevant" event, in the sense that this be the "real cause" of a given fact from among infinite conditions, the sociologist creates "imaginative constructs" by the disregard ing of one or more of those elements of "reality" that are ac tually present, and by the mental construction of a course of events that is altered through modification in one or more "con ditions." 25 These "conceptual frameworks" and this "conceptual construc tion" are the same as "ideal-typical concepts." In fact, the "first step" toward "causal imputation" is already a process of "abstrac tion" and "conceptual isolation," which breaks down the "empirical given" into "elements" viewed as "a complex of possible causal relationships." The most interesting observation is this: we so decompose the "given" into "components" thac every one of them is fitted into an "empirical rule"; hence, that it can be determined what effect each of them, with others present as "conditions," "could be expected" to have, in accordance with an empirical rule. 26</page><page sequence="74">THE IDEAL TYPE 59 The category of "objective possibility," the logical basis for every judgment of possibility, is an abstraction ? or, in other words, a reasoning ab absurdo, which tries to establish fTwhat would have happened" in the case of excluding or changing certain conditions. Here, the "as if" of the ideal type returns, as has been discussed above. A judgment of "possibility" in the sense in which the expression is used here, means, then, the continuous reference to "empirical rules" (Erfahrungsregeln). The category of "possibility" is thus not used in its negative form. It is, in other words, not an expression of our ignorance or incomplete knowledge in contrast with the assertive or apodictic judgment. Rather, to the contrary, it signifies here the reference to a positive knowledge of the "laws of events," to 27 our "nomological" knowledge, as they say. The given facts belonging to the "historical situation" are, on the other hand, our "ontological" knowledge. We are dealing with a verification or a test that follows the nor mal procedures of scientific research. One attempts to isolate an element within the context of an historical connection, then to eliminate or modify it, and finally to estimate, on the basis of a "general rule of experience," whether the process thus changed would have been able to develop in the same way. If it could have done so, then it is clear that the element excluded had no causal "relevance," and if not, the reverse is true.28 Thus one goes on to exclude or in various ways to modify first this and then that ele ment, until one manages to find the "causally relevant" element and establish the process of "adequate causation" of an effect to a cause which can provide us with a clear, objective, and valid pic ture of a historical connection. Here it is worthwhile stressing that the process of "causal imputation" has a teleological value, insofar as the "cause" is presented as a "means" and the "effect" as "end."29 This is due to the fact that in the social sciences one is dealing with human action and a "subjectively referred action," which cannot therefore be explained simply by a naturalistic type of causal concept. Rather, this must be seen in terms of "mean ing," i.e., the teleology of the actors. Finally, one must consider the question of "conditions" and his torical "conditionally" in the broad sense. In some scholars' view, Weber replaced the naturalistic notion of "cause" with that of "conditionally," and in such a way that he would never be able to know the concrete "cause" of a concrete fact but only its infinite "conditions," which "reciprocally condition" each other. In the</page><page sequence="75">60 MAX WEBER light of this interpretation, one must bear in mind that his discus sion of "conditions" and their "infinity" is not a fact established "from eternity," in the sense that to this individual shape all the varied, infinite historical conditions have contributed. Rather, it is only the reproduction, in causal explanation, of the idea of reality as "intensively and extensively infinite multiplicity." This only has a heuristic value ? one, that is, of an "ultimate concept of the ideal-typical kind," to which no effective truth and reality corre sponds, precisely because it is constructed only logically and "imaginatively." The same holds good for the "infinity" of condi tions. If this were not so, we should have an absurd regressus in indefinitum. One would never reach the end in an infinite process of "causal imputation," and never, in any individual case, be able to discover a particular, concrete, real cause. However, for Weber, there is always such a "cause." His discussion of "infin ity" is useful only as a heuristic means for not prejudicing from the beginning, through any preconceived idea of cause or causal "element," the "objective" course of causal imputation. We may say that there are historical "conditions" and historical "causes." Using the two categories of "causal imputation" we dis cover the "cause" or the "causes" (the relevant element or ele ments) of an individual, concrete historical process, isolated by a specific, individual point of view. As a result one deduces an ideal-typical, sociological law, which is hence partial and nonab solute. We might thus also say that history lives within sociology and that as far as its historical-individual element is concerned, sociology uses a concrete "causal" process, which then becomes "conditional" to it. However, this "condition" exists relative to a potential general, abstract theory of society, a systematic, phe nomenological science of society itself, beyond individual concrete sociological investigations whose potentialities and validity are not, as we have seen, to be sought in an omnicomprehensive, closed system which runs the risk of falling into arbitrary formalism. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, for ex ample, Weber tries to indicate the causal relation between re ligious and economic elements in a well-defined "historical in dividual phenomenon," capitalism. The relation between the Protestant ethic and the "spirit of capitalism" is a question for sociological investigation, to be worked out at the level of positive research. Weber analyzes only one aspect of that relation, the in fluence of ethics on economics, but not the reverse. He admits that economic conditions can also become determining causes, as</page><page sequence="76">THE IDEAL TYPE 61 treated in the other studies in Religionssoziologie. Here too, how ever, the causal connections only serve comparatively better to characterize Western development. Indeed, it is through this "comparison" that we find that the Protestant ethic is an important factor. Weber wants to find a "general law of experience," "the influence of certain religious ideas on the development of an eco nomic spirit, or the ethos of an economic system. In this case we are dealing with the connection of the spirit of modern economic life with the rational ethics of ascetic Protestantism."30 One might direct concrete investigation toward the establishment of a "general law of experience" contrary to that set up by Weber, but in such "laws" one will always be dealing with "conditions" and never with "causes." For causes are to be found not in "general laws" (which might be able to "generalize" causes, but without recognizing other important facts in reality and so, hypostasizing a single cause), but in the concrete, exemplary, specific investiga tions into determinate "historically individual phenomena." Here it is acceptable to find a cause after the conscious establishment of an "historically individual phenomenon," one that is isolated precisely because one knows, is aware, that this cause is not universal but individual and concrete. In our case, there is no "general law," excluding the others, concerning the superiority of the religious factor or religion itself over economics. There is only the discovery of an "ideal-type" correlation between the two factors, which remain quite distinct from one another and unmis takable. Weber calls this "to some extent equivocal," as indeed one is not referring to a "general law" but to those religious ele ments of Western economic ethics that are peculiar to it, as dis tinct from others that are not. Here Weber provides an important example of the interdisci plinary collaboration between historiography and sociology, in which the two kinds of explanation, historical and sociological, the causal and the conditional, come together to provide precious reciprocal aid. First, we proceed to establish "a general rule of experience" of a sociological kind, which may show us a conceptual link between a religious fact and an economic one. This can be shown only at the level of a concrete example, a causal-historical imputation of a particular individual fact like that of the "Protes tant ethic," and another individual fact such as modern "capital ism," or, more precisely, its "spirit." In order to establish the stability of this "causal imputation," Weber was to go on (in the essays in Religionssoziologie) to a</page><page sequence="77">62 MAX WEBER comparison of the same kind of correlation, this same general rule of experience, in its two relations of conditioning, each reciprocal with the other, insofar as it is "historically" established outside Europe ? in China, India and so on ? as regards not only the econ omy but all the other structures that together make up society. The relation of conditioning, or a different type of relation be tween phenomena, is consequently the conclusion he draws in de fining the explanatory schema of the social sciences. The concepts of "connection" and "condition" make it clear that in the sphere of the social sciences, especially sociology, facts cannot be facts as such, in their static condition, but are rather facts as actions. The object of Weber's sociology is social actions, not collective but individual ones. Even in social formations of a collective kind ? e.g., the state, companies, etc. ? "Action in the sense of subjec tively understandable orientation of behavior exists only as the behavior of one or more individual human beings."31 These collective formations are the representation of something present in the minds of real men, on the basis of which they direct their actions. Collective formations are thus reduced to the specif ic actions of individuals, and concepts such as "state," "associa tion," "feudalism," and so forth designate categories of specific forms of human action in society. "We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the sub jective understanding of the action of the component individuals."32 All this, Weber adds, is not in fact the case for other forms of ex planation. He criticizes the "organic" method of sociology which explains social action by moving from the totality in order to in terpret individual attitudes within it, just as one looks in physiology at the position of an organ in terms of the functioning of the whole organism. The battle against the organicist approach, as is rightly observed, "was the first defence of the essence of causal explana tion to be attributed to historical knowledge, so as to be able to discover within it an internal guarantee of validity and appear as an empirical test of relations of cause and effect."33 Weber's sociology thus defines itself as "understanding1' as it looks at the social fact in all its complexity; moreover, the task it sets itself is the understanding of the behavior of individuals, not simply as predetermined by their official function in the frame work of the social system, but rather as regards the meaning they confer on and recognize in their activity. "Meaning" for Weber means grasping the meaningful connection into which one inserts an immediately intelligible action. He also decisively modifies the</page><page sequence="78">THE IDEAL TYPE 63 notion of "meaning," freeing it from the field of immediate, lived experience, and confirming its superiority over intuition. "Under standing" is no longer regarded as a simple "sympathetic insight," but an interpretation that must be tested at the empirical level. "Meaning" does not entail literal explanation, but taking relevant facts into consideration, though these may differ from those con sidered by history. Once more, inevitably, Weber returns to the concept of value. At the root of understanding there is an analysis of value which makes us understand the historical conditions and causal frameworks from which the phenomenon originates. Thus, "Every interpretation attempts to attain clarity and certainty, but no matter how clear an interpretation as such appears to be from the point of view of meaning, it cannot on this account claim to be the causally valid interpretation."34 In fact, human action is complex. There can be connections of meaning that conceal even from the active agent himself the real interconnections of his action. External processes of action that seem the same or similar to us may in reality arise from con nections of meaning that are very different, inasmuch as men are driven by antithetical drives, conflicting motives, which we grasp in their entirety only in their final, effective result, post factum. For sociological interpretation, functional consideration of the parts of a totality is only a point of departure" for purposes of practical illustration and for provisional orientation. In these re spects it is not only useful but indispensable. But at the same time if its cognitive value is overestimated and its concepts illegiti mately 'reified,T it can be highly dangerous."35 Here Weber clearly takes his distance from Rickert's distinction between natural sciences and those of culture, which rests on the heterogeneity of cognitive orientations (natural, legal, social and individual sciences). In his view, the social sciences are distin guishable not because they have spirit as their object rather than nature, or because they incline toward the internal understanding of a phenomenon rather than its causal explanation; what distin guishes them is their particular orientation toward individuality. It is not the object, but the end for which it is examined; thus it is not understanding as immediate intuition but the way in which it arrives at an empirical validification, by translation into a specific form of causal explanation, which makes the social sciences dis tinct and autonomous. We have already remarked that Dilthey's position should also be reinterpreted. In fact, Weber does not deny that the social sei</page><page sequence="79">64 MAX WEBER ences have their own field of enquiry and special procedure. He simply denies that either of these is sufficient to characterize their logical structure. What might distinguish the cultural from the natural sciences is no longer the presence or absence of gener al concepts, but the different function nomological knowledge dis charges in their context. In fact, one might say that the theory of the ideal type is presented as an attempt to bring out the instru mental function of nomological knowledge in the context of the sci ences of culture. For Weber, the interpretive procedure of sociology, as we have said, is individualist. That is, it rests on the action of individuals as "functioning types" who emerge in society. Thus, The real empirical sociological investigation begins with the question: What motives determine and lead the individual members and participants in this so cialistic community to behave in such a way that the community came into being in the first place and that it continues to exist?36 This individualistic method, he specifies, does not mean individual istic evaluation, just as the conceptual-rational elaboration of the ideal type does not involve a belief in the prevalence of rational motives. By referring concepts concerning collectivity to concrete human operations, or the action of individuals differentiated in typical ways, he clearly does not want to destroy human bonds or links but rather to rediscover their real roots. The action that is of special interest to "understanding" sociology is, as Weber terms it, "intelligible on the grounds of its meaning." It is the attitude referred by the agent to the attitudes of others, codetermined by this meaningful reference, which can thus be ex plained intelligibly on the basis of that meaning. For him, action is Buddhist contemplation and Christian asceticism, linked mean ingfully for the actor with internal objects, as much as it is the economic concern of one dedicated to material goods, tied to exter nal objects and to the financial and economic workings of the mar ket. By this Weber does not mean that only action that is rational as regards its ends is intelligible, and that by definition the abnormal eludes explanation. "Understanding sociology" can also grasp situ ations and affective states, and their typical consequences for be havior: "The interpretation of a coherent course of conduct is 'subjectively adequate' (or 'adequate on the level of meaning')</page><page sequence="80">THE IDEAL TYPE 65 insofar as, according to our habitual modes of thought and feeling, its component parts taken in their mutual relation are recognized to constitute a TtypicalT complex of meaning,"37 precisely so as to be able to determine what is "irrational regarding the aim." The process of understanding in itself leads to no scientifically valid result. Understanding has scientific validity only when the guiding hypotheses that have been formulated establish an empiri cal basis of confirmation; when, that is, understanding becomes simultaneously a causal explanation. Thus, in Weber's view, the evidence for an explanation does not imply its validity. In other words, the process of understanding is legitimate so long as it does not involve immediate understanding, but rather the formulation of interpretive hypotheses that must be empirically tested. The so cial sciences, by making use of the process of interpretation, tend to verify causal relationships between individual phenomena. Thus the understanding of the significance of a phenomenon coincides with the determination of the conditions of its occurrence. The connection between understanding and causal explanation as the basis for research in the social sciences is thus made clear. It allows us to determine the meaning of behavior, or the intended reference of behavior to that of others, and to understand what directs the activity of man in one direction rather than another. "Understanding" sociology, whose object is not human behavior as such, but rather meaningful behavior, does not therefore exclude causal explanation but, on the contrary, necessarily presupposes it.</page><page sequence="81">Weber and Marx Weber's attitude toward Marx is important for the understanding of the man himself and the meaning of his work. In fact, he sees Marxism as a practical example of ideal-type construction and of confusion between the spheres of "being" and "should be." Histor ical materialism is considered as above all a historical-evolu tionary hypothesis to be tested against experience. It is thus not a Weltanschauung but a working hypothesis, which ought to have empirical value. According to Antoni, Weber "overcame historical materialism the moment he discovered that irrational motives in fluenced economic activity in what was sometimes a decisive fashion, and recognized that irrational forces, great Utopias, sug gestions, and intuitions dominated men and moved history."1 This, however, is not a simply ideological or reductive "over coming," of the sort that counterposes system to system. The view of Albert Salomon, who sees Weber as a "bourgeois Marx," seems to me untenable. Weber's position is intended to be more comprehensive than, and not symmetrical with, the Marxist one. Weber takes a position vis-?-vis historical materialism when he rejects the Marxist assumption of a determined direction of con ditioning ? one that runs from structure to superstructure and has the character of a general interpretation of history. As against the Marxist assumption of an irreversible determination by the economic instance of every other personal or social state, material or immaterial, Weber proposes a three-part division of social phenomena on the basis of their relation with the economy: Within the total range of social-economic problems, we are now able to distin guish events and constellations of norms, institutions, etc., the economic aspect of which constitutes their primary cultural significance for us. Such are, for example, the phenomena of the stock exchange and the banking world, which, in the main, interest us only in this respect. This will be the case regularly (but 66</page><page sequence="82">WEBER AND MARX 6 7 not exclusively) when institutions are involved which were deliberately created or used for economic ends. Such objects of our knowledge we may call "eco nomic" events (or institutions, as the case may be). There are other phenom ena, for instance, religious ones, which do not interest us, or at least do not primarily interest us with respect to their economic significance but which, however, under certain circumstances do acquire significance in this regard because they have consequences which are of interest from the economic point of view. These we shall call "economically relevant" phenomena. Finally there are phenomena which are not "economic" in our sense and the economic effects of which are of no, or at best slight, interest to us (e.g. the develop ments of the artistic taste of a period) but which in individual instances are in their turn more or less strongly influenced in certain important aspects by economic factors such as, for instance, the social stratification of the artis tically interested public. We shall call these "economically conditioned phe nomena." 2 This three-part view of social "reality" makes clear the breadth of Weber's approach, and the analytical scheme to which this cor responds. On the basis of this approach, Marx's scheme based on the "material" interests of life into which contemporaries must of necessity enter is clearly rejected: Undoubtedly the selection of the social-economic aspect of cultural life signifies a very definite delimitation of our theme. It will be said that the economic, or as it has been inaccurately called, the "materialistic" point of view, from which culture is here being considered, is "one-sided." This is true and the one sidedness is intentional.3 However, with this clear rejection, there comes also a renewed trust in his own scientific method, which ultimately recognizes the importance of the economic function in the coordinated whole of structures and motivations on which the setup and dynamism of the social process are dependent. Liberated as we are from the antiquated notion that all cultural phenomena can be deduced as a product or function of the constellation of "material" interests, we believe nevertheless that the analysis of social and cultural phenomena with special reference to their economic ramifications was a scientific principle of creative fruitfulness and, with careful application and freedom from dogmatic restrictions, will remain such for a very long time to come. The so-called "materialistic conception of history" as a Weltanschauung or as a formula for the causal explanation of historical reality is to be rejected most emphatically. The advancement of the economic interpretation of history is one of the most important aims of our journal.4</page><page sequence="83">68 MAX WEBER Weber is thus not opposed to seeking an explanation of history in economic terms. What he rejects is the absolutizing petrifaction of this explicative criterion, its solidification into a dogma. In the face of this danger, Weber is sharply polemical: The so-called "materialistic conception of history" with the crude elements of genius of the early form which appeared, for instance, in the Communist Mani festo, still prevails only in the minds of laymen and dilettantes. In these cir cles one still finds the peculiar condition that their need for a causal explana tion of an historical event is never satisfied until somewhere or somehow eco nomic causes are shown (or seem) to be operative. Where this however is the case, they content themselves with the most threadbare hypotheses and the most general phrases since they have then satisfied their dogmatic need to believe that the economic "factor" is the "real" one, the only "true" one, and the one which "in the last instance is everywhere decisive."5 Weber is aware that this phenomenon is not unusual. Almost all the sciences, from philology to biology, have occasionally claimed to be the sources not only of specialized scientific knowledge but of T"Weltan schauungen" as well. Under the impression of the profound cultural signifi cance of modern economic transformations and especially of the far-reaching ramifications of the "labor question," the inevitable monistic tendency of every type of thought which is not self-critical naturally follows this path.6 The same holds for anthropologists, who strongly believe that " Tin the last analysis' all historical events are results of the interplay of innate 'racial qualities.' "7 Nonetheless, Weber accuses those who have accepted the economic interpretation of the historical process of an "unparallelled lack of critical sense." If, following a period of boundless overestimation, the danger now exists that its scientific value will be underestimated, this is the result of the unexampled naivete with which the economic interpretation of reality was applied as a "uni versal" canon which explained all cultural phenomena ? i.e., all those which are meaningful to us ? as, in the last analysis, economically conditioned.8 Weber backs this up with precise critical demands, offers sub stantiated examples, and brings out the most serious ambiguities and unresolved difficulties in economic reductionism. Its logical form does not seem to be unitary; indeed, reference to causal explanation does not seem possible. However:</page><page sequence="84">WEBER AND MARX 69 Wherever the strictly economic explanation encounters difficulties, various de vices are available for maintaining its general validity as the decisive causal factor. Sometimes every historical event which is not explicable by the invoca tion of economic motives is regarded for that very reason as a scientifically insignificant "accident." At others, the definition of "economic" is stretched beyond recognition so that all human interests which are related in any way whatsoever to the use of material means are included in the definition. If it is historically undeniable that different responses occur in two situations which are economically identical ? due to political, religious, climatic and countless other noneconomic determinants ? then in order to maintain the primacy of the economic all these factors are reduced to historically accidental "conditions" upon which the economic factor operates as a "cause."9 There is another common attempt to justify the predominant significance of the economic element in interpreting the constant correlation and succession of individual moments of cultural life in terms of a causal or functional dependence of the latter on the former, or rather, all the remnants on one factor ? the economic. When a particular noneconomic institution has historically per formed a specific function for economic class interests ? for ex ample, where particular religious institutions let themselves be and indeed were used as "black police" ? the whole network of institutions is viewed either as being created precisely for this function, or, wholly metaphysically, as directed fundamentally to a tendency derived from the economic element.10 In Weber's view, the unilateral and exclusive determination of historical processes by economic ones, the state of production and the use of material resources, and especially the determination of the historical action of men by material interests, in no way satisfies more serious scholars. In no field of cultural phenomena nor of economic pro cesses does reduction to economic causation appear exhaustive, or even merely sufficient. Ideas and the various intellectual, artistic, and religious manifestations in general are not simply echoes of economic situations. For Weber they are forces working in history which condition economic development itself, just as in turn they are conditioned by it. The determination of the extent of that reciprocal influence cannot be decided a priori, by speculation. It can only be the object of an investigation that must from time to time take a particular direction. It is unnecessary nowadays to go into detail to prove to the specialist that this interpretation of the purpose of the economic analysis of culture is in part the expression of a certain historical constellation which turned its scientific in terest towards certain economically conditioned cultural problems, and in part the rabid chauvinism of a specialized department of science. It is clear that</page><page sequence="85">70 MAX WEBER today it is antiquated at best. The explanation of everything by economic causes alone is never exhaustive in any sense whatsoever in any sphere of cultural phenomena, not even in the "economic" sphere itself. In principle, a banking history of a nation which adduces only economic motives for explanatory pur poses is naturally just as unacceptable as an explanation of the Sistine Madonna as a consequence of the social-economic basis of the epoch in which it was cre ated. It is no way more complete than, for instance, the explanation of capi talism by reference to certain shifts in the content of the religious ideas which played a role in the genesis of the capitalistic attitude; nor is it more exhaus tive than the explanation of a political structure from its geographical back ground. In all of these cases, the degree of significance which we are to attri bute to economic factors is decided by the class of causes to which we are to impute those specific elements of the phenomenon in question to which we at tach significance in given cases and in which we are interested.11 Weber's criticism is not purely negative. Historical material ism is rejected as a general conception of history, but it is valued as indicating a specific direction for research. Among Marxists Weber's thesis found its most valuable and suggestive interpreter in Gy?rgy Lukacs. Countering the criticisms made of historical materialism's unilateral nature, Lukacs emphasizes the dialectical basis of the Marxist view of history as its fundamental character istic. In a polemic against Engels's positivistic travesty of Marx's thought into a mechanical relation of determination, it is related to Hegelian categories, which are reinterpreted and provided with new meaning. Marxist orthodoxy is no longer defined in a sys tematic theory, but rather by the rigorous acceptance of, and faith fulness to, the dialectical method. Historical "facts" are not to be studied and explained in their empirical, specific form, as isolated entities. They must rather be placed in the wider framework of the historical process seen as a totality. Historical understanding thus comes to act as a fulcrum, and is identified with this referral of every "fact" to the "global" process. "Dialectics insists on the concrete unity of the whole. Yet although it exposes these appear ances for the illusions they are ? albeit illusions necessarily en gendered by capitalism ? in this 'scientific' atmosphere it still gives the impression of being an arbitrary construction,"12 though there is a concrete, not abstract, dialectical method, not viewed in the sense of undifferentiated identity, but as the "whole," the concrete reality immanent to all its parts and their foundation. Lukacs establishes the relationship between Hegelian dialectic and historical materialism in favor of the latter, as the authentic sig nificance of Hegelfs insight; and, by reference to the writings of the young Marx, he sets the terms of the "particular objectivity" of</page><page sequence="86">WEBER AND MARX 71 relations between men. Man as "social being" is the subject of the historical process, and for him history is indeed "the succession of those processes in which the forms taken by this activity and the relations of man to himself (to nature, to other men) are over thrown."13 Thus, to understand a specific moment in the real functioning of the process, as regards the totality, means establishing its affinity to a determinate form of objectivity and, in relation to this form, also to the others that have preceded it and made its development possible. In the historical process, as it is realized through the succession of the forms of objectivity, the dialectical structure in which those "forms" are "relativized" is revealed. The forms are relativized insofar as they discover their significance in their connection with totality in such a way that economic "structure" and politico-ideological "superstructures," to use Engels's terminol ogy, come to coincide and essentially to converge in the composi tion of a particular historical phase. While recognizing equally with Weber the element of technical and procedural rationality in particular reference to modern capi talism, Lukacs immediately connects this organizational rationality with the "reification" of modern life and the "dehumanization" of economic relations. The price of capitalist rationality is the "alienated," "atomized" individual, reduced to an object of ex change and deprived of his essence. Thus the complex phenomenon called "capitalism," rather than being explained in its particular individual nature by means of empirical investigation of its distinc tive characteristics and the historical conditions that made it pos sible, is related "dialectically" to the self-development of "total ity." What Lukacs has to establish is the objective transformation of relations between men which determined capitalism's birth. However, this transformation is assumed on a global level, specu latively, and is not investigated. In that transformation, besides, Lukacs immediately reads the fate of capitalist society itself ? being led by its own contradictions to negate itself dialectically, to dissolve into a new society beyond exploitation and alienation. Thus Lukacs replaces Weber's reciprocal conditioning of capital ism by the other basic aspects of the modern world with the prior ity of the economic order. To this are related an essence and functions of an original kind, an objective, constructive form to which must be connected ideological constructs, psychological motivation, both individual and group, and class consciousness, in which they find their nourishment and ultimate explanation.</page><page sequence="87">72 MAX WEBER Given these premises, the decisively negative judgment Lukacs brings to bear on sociology, and Weber in particular, is not sur prising. For Lukacs, the birth of sociology as an independent discipline has its methodological starting point in the proposed independence of social from economic questions; this claimed independence is in turn tied to deep structural crises in the bourgeois economy. The very naturalistic bases of the first sociology conceived of as scientia scientiarum have "the function of eliminating, by means of economics, the contradictory nature of social being, and this is the basic critique of the capitalist system."14 Sociology's abandonment of the characteristic of "universal sci ence" is related to its link with the concept of progress, which in any case was primarily set up in conformity with the needs of the bourgeoisie and was supposed to lead to an "idealized capitalist society, as though at the summit of human evolution."15 Thus, after a short time, "the scientific, especially biological basis, in step with the general political and economic evolution of the bourgeoisie, is converted into a methodology, and an ideology hostile to progress, and one reactionary in many ways."16 It turns toward specific research, scarcely opening up the major questions of the structure and development of society. Lukac's critique is especially directed toward a fault he regards as particularly that of very rigorously specialized sciences, derived from their re sponsibilities as conditioned by the division of labor in capitalism itself. This involves the need which grows spontaneously and never becomes self-aware in bourgeois methodology ? that of transferring the decisive problems of social life away from a special discipline, which is not competent to resolve them, to another specialized discipline which in turn and for the same reason declares itself in competent. This involves, naturally, the decisive questions of social life, as regards which decadent bourgeois society has an increasing interest in prevent ing their being clearly formulated and ultimately resolved. Social agnosticism as a form of ideological defence of positions with no hope thus comes to have a methodological tool which, unconsciously, is functional.17 Moving on to a more specific confutation of sociological theories, Lukacs does not manage to break out of the core of materialist doctrine, against which he says that there is (as opposed to "bour geois ideologies," and beyond "simple, total ignorance" or "gross, pedantic refusal") a "more subtle rejection" being imposed; and "even though distorted," some aspects compatible with their postu</page><page sequence="88">WEBER AND MARX 73 lates might be accepted. Therefore, as regards Weber's rejection of the primacy of the economic element, Lukacs replies with a similar reproof, noting that "historical materialism also admits that there are complicated relations of reciprocal dependence in concrete social reality (as Engels says, economic causes are only determinant in the last instance)."18 Lukacs observes that "the structure of reciprocal dependency, quite acceptable to modern relativism, must not be upheld; this is just a polemical advance against historical materialism. Max Weber's views lead him to at tribute to ideological phenomena (religion) an immanent develop ment derived from within: this tendency is continually transformed into the point of view of those for whom these have priority as the cause of the whole process."19 After making it clear that the central problem of German so ciology was one of transcending historical materialism with its own theoretical notion of the origin and meaning of capitalism, and after dealing with Sombart's and Weber's efforts, Lukacs observes that their methodology does not deal with the real economic prob lems, such as the question of surplus value and exploitation, and "only apparently" grasps the essence of capitalism. The fact of the separation of the workers from the means of production and the fact of free labor are certainly recognized by Weber and play an important part in his sociology. The decisive characteristics of capitalism are still rational ity and calculability.... This idea means necessarily that the economics of capitalism is understood backwards, in that superficial phenomena interpreted simplistically take on the main role as regards the problem of the development of the productive forces. This abstract deformation gives German sociologists the chance of attributing to certain ideological forms, especially law and reli gion, a decisive importance equal and even superior to that of economics. From this it follows that in an ever-increasing manner analogies replace the method of causal explanation.20 However, where Luk?cs seems to show a radical misunderstand ing of sociology as an empirical science, not speculative but con ceptually oriented, is the point at which he brands it as "formal ist," "subjectivist," and "agnostic," remarking that consequently it "only manages to point to determinate 'types,' to build typologies and make the phenomena themselves part of them." Later he argues: It is clear that Weber's sociological categories simply reflect the abstractly formulated psychology of the calculating individual in the capitalist system. The concept of "chance" is on the one hand based on Mach's (empirio-critical)</page><page sequence="89">74 MAX WEBER interpretation of the phenomena of nature, and on the other is derived from the psychological subjectivism of marginalism. It transforms objective formations and their metamorphoses, and events themselves, into a chaotic network of "presumptions," confirmed or not, of "expectations" (in the sense of waiting for...) satisfied or not. And the evolutionary laws are no less than the "chance," more or less probable, of seeing each time one or other of these "presumptions" or "expectations" coming about.21 For Weber, the subjectivist character is supposed to be ex pressed, therefore, "with the greatest clarity" in the concept of law, precisely viewed as "chance," in which "not only is all objec tive social reality resolved in a subjectivist manner, but these same social situations come to take on a complexity which is ap parently precise, but really extremely confused."22 Lukacs in sists on explaining, very didactically, how German sociologists cannot manage to understand or indeed to know "Marxist eco nomics, since they place themselves on the terrain of the new sub jectivist vulgar economics. Within this polemical attitude, so ciology can only be a specialist science, essentially ancillary as regards history and yet incapable, because of its formalism," of any historical explanation. Weber's sociology thus leads to a still greater irrationalization in restricting the field of action to a mere technical criticism, or looking for "those means that are appro priate in view of a specific end" and establishing "the consequences that the application of the means required would have.. .besides the eventual achievement of the desired goal," with the subsequent ex clusion of the normative judgment, the object of faith: "the exclu sion of value judgments from sociology, and its seeming purifica tion from all irrationalist elements, only lead once more to the derationalization of the historico-social future."23 On the same line of understanding the level of research in Weber's sociology, there is another emphasis which takes its in spiration from a phrase in his Politische Schriften concerning the impossibility of "scientifically" sustaining practical commitments because of the different orders of value in the world, which he sees as in unresolvable conflict. In this regard, Lukacs is forced into an immediate return to the Marxist theory of class struggle. Lukacs says: Max Weber runs into the problem dealt with in the Communist Manifesto, ac cording to which history is the history of class struggle. However, since he could not and would not, because of his Weltanschauung, recognize this as a fact, as he was not inclined to do so, and, since he was not prepared to draw the</page><page sequence="90">WEBER AND MARX 75 logical dialectical consequences from the dialectical structure of social reality, he was forced to take refuge in irrationalism. This shows very clearly how the irrationalism of the imperialist period gave birth to false solutions to problems which were legitimate in themselves, as they were presented by reality itself. That is, reality, with increasing insistence, poses dialectical questions to the ideologues: these, however, are unable to resolve these dialectically, for so cial, and thence methodological, reasons. Irrationalism is thus the way to avoid the dialectical solution of a dialectical question. This seeming scientific quality, the exclusion from sociology of value judgments, is thus really the highest point so far reached by irrationalism.24 The opposition between Weber on one side, and Marx and Lukacs on the other, is therefore radical. Weber, though with the aid of a multiplicity of orders of explanation, believes that he cannot and should not achieve a total explanation, while for Lukacs, and Marx ists in general, there is no other explanatory scheme aside from that which connects every phenomenon with a particular stage or level of development in a direct, unambiguous manner. From the sociological point of view, the inadequacy of historical materialism as a "model" for the explanation of the "spirit" of capitalism is derived from the lack of possibility of explaining the way in which the economic subject places himself in relation to conditions that have in fact changed. In fact, it is not sufficient to presuppose avarice or, even worse, human wickedness to explain how someone who became a capitalist could actually do so. We are always con cerned with psychological categories and, so to speak, "spiritual" motives. The rejection of a critique in terms of the content of Marxist theory is what interests economists like Schumpeter and sociologists like Dahrendorf, who draw attention to those real developments of capitalist society that are empirically determin able. It would be better, however, to emphasize the deep meth odological differences (conceptual and analytico-instrumental) that separate Weber from Marx and directly influence their view of the destiny of reason in modern society. I have already noted that Weber did not reject Marxism in order to propose another sys tematic, closed theory as alternative. He opposed the dogmatic claims of a total explanation of history by way of economics. In expressions like "authentic causes," or "ultimate causes," and "in the last analysis," used in relation to economic facts, he saw a naive justification, without any scientific value, and endowed with a metaphysical outlook, political or ideological. As regards the "causal explanation" of a particular phenomenon, one may put forward the Marxist reference to an immanent</page><page sequence="91">76 MAX WEBER "totality" and the absolute, unilaterally "determining" economic element. This can be contrasted with Weber's model of the em pirical establishment of "conditioning." This occurs through a process of choice within the multiplicity of the empirically given and its causal relations. One chooses a finite series and specific orientation of relations ? which means isolating only one among the many series of relationships. EngelsTs explanation, accepted by Lukacs himself, that economic causes operate only "in the last instance," changes nothing and involves no substantial limitation; on the other hand it represents a clear confirmation of the pres ence of a metaphysical type of argument arising from a substra tum. However, the accusation leveled against Weber by Lukacs, that the former was responsible for an immanent emphasis on ideological phenomena which would thus be predominant over the whole process, was unfounded. The reason for this was that, as we have seen, especially in analyzing religious phenomena, Weber was always concerned to proclaim the interdependence and inter action between "world" and "religion," and even accepts the eco nomic "conditioning" for the growth of the latter. The bidirectional conditioning for which Weber argues makes Lukacs Ts criticism of an "idealist and spiritualist interpretation of history" untenable. Weber does not believe in an absolute manner that ideas move the world. The case of capitalism simply offers the example of a pos sible tendency of conditioning, in whose context, however, Protes tantism is not "the cause" but one of the causes of capitalism, or, better, of certain aspects of capitalism. As we have seen, the theory of "ideal type" itself, though insuf ficiently clarified, is alien to a preconstituted systematic doctrine and points only to a provisional "criterion of comparison" with merely instrumental functions. It is hypothetical, prior to being empirically established; by contrast, Marx and Marxists tradi tionally rush to use the deus ex machina of the dialectic and to tality to arrive at an explanation of everything "in the last anal ysis." At the same time, the ideal type is distinguished from natural istic presuppositions and metaphysical claims. Far from consid ering the more general characteristics as "essential," it proposes setting out the "original" nature of each historical phenomenon. To the extent that it applies to historically individual cases (as, for example, modern Western capitalism), its function is to bring out the characteristic elements, the "unique," not the general traits. While starting from a specific analysis of contemporary</page><page sequence="92">WEBER AND MARX 77 society, Marx, by contrast, hopes to be able to propose large scale historico-evolutionary hypotheses which, by reason of their macroscopic character, run the risk of being transformed into "essences" of all society, all possible history, and thus being solidified into eternal dogma. Weber regards historical materialism as having a relative val idity, but only if it is viewed as a sociological law or hypothesis that must be tested at the empirical level. It is a heuristic prin ciple or "ideal type" which, while it is as unilateral as any other point of view that delimits the field of research, may be valid as a conceptual schema or reference point for specific research. Weber's attempt to stress the ideologizing one-sidedness of the Marxist schema is more intense and evident in his studies of the sociology of religion. Here, in fact, reciprocal conditioning achieves a result of special importance. In his analysis of types of religious community ? along with conditioning by class situa tions, ideological interests, and determinate social strata ? there is an attempt to grasp the reciprocal and significant influences of the "lived ethic" on the economy. I have no intention here of ex pounding a detailed analysis of Weber's studies on comparative religion, with which I deal elsewhere. Here, I shall restrict my self to observations of a general methodological sort which are important for setting up sociological analysis. It should first of all be clear, and should be carefully borne in mind, that Weber proposed to carry out his research on the level of historical re construction and empirical observation. He wished to study "the conditions and effects of a particular type of social action. The external courses of religious behavior are so diverse that an under standing of this behavior can only be achieved from the viewpoint of the subjective experiences, ideas, and purposes of the individu als concerned ? in short, from the viewpoint of the religious be havior's 'meaning' (Sinn)."25 Moving on to trace the original form of "action religiously or magically motivated," Weber refers back to a "mundane" process, one that is at least relatively rational: "religious or magical behavior or thinking must not be set apart from the range of everyday purposive conduct, particularly since even the ends of the religious and magical actions are predomin antly economic.... The person performing the magical act.. .will instead distinguish between the greater or lesser ordinariness of the phenomena in question."26 From the strictly naturalistic or pre-animist notion, there is an abstractive development toward more complex, animistic forms by</page><page sequence="93">78 MAX WEBER way of Mthe notion that certain beings are concealed 'behind* and responsible for the activity of the charismatically endowed natural objects, artifacts, animals, or persons. This is the belief in spirits."27 "Spirit" is still conceived of initially in an indetermi nate manner, being neither soul, demon, nor god, "but something indeterminate, material yet invisible, nonpersonal and yet some how endowed with volition. By entering into a concrete object, spirit endows the latter with its distinctive power. The spirit may depart from its host or vessel, leaving the latter inoperative and causing the magician's charisma to fail. In other cases, the spirit may diminish into nothingness, or it may enter into another person or thing."28 This process of abstraction ? for which the demonstration of a specific economic condition as its precondition is problematic ? is most advanced "in those societies within which certain persons possess charismatic magical powers that inhere only in those with special qualifications..., the foundation for the oldest of all 'voca tions,' that of the professional necromancer.M The magician, by contrast to the layman, is "permanently endowed with charisma. Furthermore, he has turned into an 'enterprise' the distinctive sub jective condition that notably represents or mediates charisma, namely ecstasy. .. [which] occurs in a social form, the orgy,... the primordial form of religious association. But the orgy is an occasional activity, whereas the enterprise of the magician is con tinuous and he is responsible for its operation."29 It is precisely "on the basis of the experience with the conditions of orgies, and in all likelihood under the influence of his professional practice" that there "evolved the concept of 'soul' as a separate entity present in, behind or near natural objects, even as the human body contains something that leaves it in dream, syncope, ecstasy, or death."30 The specific aspect of this evolutionary process is not so much "personality, impersonality, or suprapersonality" of the extra sensory powers, but the fact that, apart from the things and mate rial events that impinge on our senses, other factors acquire more importance "insofar as and because they mean something." Magic is thus transformed from being a direct action into a sym bolic one3l; at the same time, the idea that all the personal goods of the dead should accompany them in the tomb takes on a decisive eco nomic importance. This idea is gradually watered down, to the point of being reduced to the requirement not to make use of the goods of the deceased, at least for a certain period, or also often of not using their possessions so as not to arouse their envy.</page><page sequence="94">WEBER AND MARX 79 Primitive naturalism thus is submerged in a complex of symbolic actions through the faithful, ritualistic repetition of magical atti tudes proven to be effective, and in this magic circle all fields of human activity become involved. For this reason the greatest contrasts of purely dogmatic views, even within religions that have undergone rationalization, may be tolerated more easily than innovations in symbolism, which threaten the magical efficacy of action or even ? and this is the new concept supervening upon symbolism ? arouse the anger of a god or an ancestral spirit. Thus, the question whether the sign of the cross should be made with two or three fingers was a basic reason for the schism of the Russian church as late as the seventeenth century. Again, the fear of giving serious affront to two dozen saints by omitting the days sacred to them from the calendar year has hindered the reception of the Gregorian calendar in Russia until today. Among the magicians of the American Indians, faulty singing during ritual dances was immediately punished by the death of the guilty singer, to remove the evil magic or to avert the anger of the god.... The first and fundamental effect of religious views upon the conduct of life and therefore upon economic activity was generally stereotyping. The alteration of any practice which is somehow executed under the protection of supernatural forces may affect the interests of spirits and gods. To the natural uncertainties and resistances facing every innovator, religion thus adds powerful impedi ments of its own. The sacred is the uniquely unalterable. 32 As for the gods, Weber holds that at the beginning they are not regarded as "anthropomorphic" beings, but may often represent an unordered mixture of chance creations accidentally preserved by the cult. A pantheon evolves only when "systematic thinking concerning religious practice and the rationalization of life gen erally, with its increasing demands upon the gods, have reached a certain level, the details of which may differ greatly from case to case. The emergence of a pantheon entails the specialization and characterization of the various gods as well as the allocation of constant attributes and the differentiation of their jurisdic tions."33 These processes of anthropomorphization and establish ment of areas of competence, though partly related to the divinities already in being, involve "the tendency to propel ever further the rationalization of the worship of the gods as well as of the very idea of god,"34 and exercise a direct influence on the specific characteristics of a people's customs and practices of life. As for the reason that one of many kinds of god should have had predomi nance over the others: while we have insufficient knowledge of the economic situation and historical conditions that have determined the development of individual peoples, Weber does not hesitate to</page><page sequence="95">80 MAX WEBER accept the relationship with economic and generally "worldly" con ditions, even though only hypothetically. These may lie in objects of nature that are important to the economy, such as stellar bodies, or in organic processes that the gods and demons possess or influence, evoke or impede: disease, death, birth, fire, drought, rainstorm, and harvest failure. The outstanding economic importance of certain events may enable a particular god to achieve primacy within the pantheon, as for example the primacy of the god of heaven. He may be conceived of primarily as the master of light and warmth, but among groups that raise cattle he is most fre quently conceived of as the lord of reproduction.35 On the other hand, the gods (especially the celestial ones who are masters of the stars in their course, which, according to an cient belief, fixes earthly laws) become lords and masters of what has or should have precise rules, particularly as regards "the de termination of judicial rules and morality." "Yet there is no con certed action, as there is no individual action, without its special god. Indeed, if an association is to be permanently guaranteed, it must have such a god. Whenever an organization is not the person al power base of an individual ruler, but genuinely an association of man, it has need of a god of its own."36 Even though mono polistic religions have existed and still exist, and "the path to monotheism has been traversed with varying degrees of consis tency, ... nowhere ? not even during the Reformation ? was the existence of spirits and demons permanently eliminated.... The decisive consideration was and remains: who is deemed to exert the stronger influence on the interests of the individual in his everyday life, the theoretically supreme god or the lower spirits and demons?"37 The relationship between the god and the charismatic magician itself turns on this collusion between spiritual and material. The action of the god through magic formulas becomes, as it were, pressed into the service of man. In place of strictly magical for mulas, in terms of a natural evolution toward more perfect forms, more in harmony with material conditions, there develops a cult which is rationalized as an individual "invocation." In this, "such prayer has a purely businesslike, rationalized form that sets forth the achievements of the supplicant in behalf of the god and then claims adequate recompense therefor,"38 while, however, there comes into view in the characteristic results of the increas ingly broad, rational systematization of the conception of god a certain</page><page sequence="96">WEBER AND MARX 81 recession of the original, practical and calculating rationalism. As such primi tive rationalism recedes, the significance of distinctively religious behavior is sought less and less in the purely external advantages of everyday economic success. Thus, the goal of religious behavior is successively MirrationalizedM until finally otherworldly noneconomic goals come to represent what is distinc tive in religious behavior. But for this very reason the extraeconomic evolu tion just described requires as one of its prerequisites the existence of specific personal carriers.39 Analogous to the distinction between "cult" and "magic" is the separation of "magician" from "priest," whose characteristic is no longer the restraining of demons by magical means but rather influence on the gods through "veneration" and regular practice of the cult linked to determined norms, places, and times, and re ferred to specific groups which comprise the priesthood. "There can be no priesthood without a cult, although there may well be a cult without a specialized priesthood,"40 just as rationalization of metaphysico-religious ideas, and a specifically religious ethic, is lacking where one of these two terms is missing. "The rationaliza tion of religious life was fragmentary or entirely missing wherever the priesthood failed to achieve independent status and power."41 Rationalization of individual meanings into a logical system, together with a comprehensive interpretation of the world and of man's place in it, are immediate needs for the spirit when the problem of meaning is posed. At a certain point the process of rationalization implies a crisis of traditionalism and, vice versa, every acute crisis of traditionalism involves a process of ration alization, as whoever shatters tradition through his own action is forced to clarify his attitudes in relation to those from which he has diverged. On the other hand, the development of what is radi cally novel, and was counterposed to magic, "generally presup posed the operation of one or both of two forces outside the priest hood: prophets, the bearers of metaphysical or religious ethical revelation, and the laity, the nonpriestly devotees of the cult."42 The prophet is important as initiator of a major process of ra tionalization in interpreting the meaning of the world and the atti tudes individuals should adopt in its regard. Weber defines the prophet as "a purely individual bearer of charisma, who by virtue of his mission proclaims a religious doctrine or divine command ment."43 He is always a man with a mission, who feels himself to be in close relation to a supernatural being or order. The proph et's mission is taken on and carried out without the authorization of any human institution ? indeed, often in conscious opposition</page><page sequence="97">82 MAX WEBER to institutions. The figure of the prophet, differentiated from the wizard and the priest by virtue of his special authoritarian and doctrinaire ethico-social characteristics, through his prophesy ings always provides us with Ma unified view of the world derived from a consciously integrated meaningful attitude toward life. To the prophet, both the life of man and the world, both social and cos mic events, have a certain systematic and coherent meaning, to which man's conduct must be oriented if it is to bring salvation, and after which it must be patterned in an integrally meaningful manner."44 The appearance of a prophet does, however, have immediate social consequences. The fact that prophecy itself implies a rup ture with traditionalism means that the relation of the prophet and of his followers with the society in which they emerge is very problematic ? especially as regards the religious tradition, but also for the other elements of that society. Furthermore, in the course of its development this community inevitably undergoes internal changes, especially at the point of the passage from the founder to his successors, as prophetic religion is the source of social organization independently of the spontaneous development of the traditional order. In fact, the structure of the unitary "mean ing" provided by prophesying ? though this can be radically sub divided, and can gather together into a unity motivations that seem logically heterogeneous ? in Weber's view always involves an at tempt to systematize all the phenomena of life. Insofar as the con struct is not primarily dominated by a need for logical coherence, but rather for practical judgments (even if at different levels and with different consequences), it subsequently involves a synthesis of the practical attitude in order to form a way of carrying on life, however this might manifest itself in individual cases. Weber's description and interpretation of the figure and social role of the prophet sound amazingly close to those of the entrepreneur as "dynamic innovator," as outlined by Joseph A. Schumpeter. The prophet, like Schumpeter's entrepreneur, is a factor that contri butes to the breaking up of the routine of the status quo. Yet the act of innovation may be self-limiting ? consolidating only if the innovation can translate itself into daily practice rather than being a charismatic fact. Prophesying revelation is not enough: it must be translated into institutional form in order to become the very basis of the community. This occurs historically, Weber observes, when "Such a transformation of a personal following into a per manent congregation is the normal process by which the doctrine</page><page sequence="98">WEBER AND MARX 83 of the prophets enters into everyday life, as the function of a per manent institution. Consequently, in this kind of situation they endeavor to create a congregation whereby the personal following of the cult will assume the form of a permanent organization and become a community with fixed rights and duties."45 The consequences of a prophetic movement on the social plane, however, depend on the means it uses to realize its religious in terests. Every form of religion appears, in fact, as linked to the interests and demands of particular social strata, privileged nega tively or positively. However, this does not mean, as Weber often warns, that there is an unequivocal correspondence between "stra tum" or "class" and religious orientation. The same condition of a stratum or class can create different forms of religiosity, just as the same form of religion can be accepted by different strata and even be the consequence of their cooperation. The clearest example of the possibility of multiple relations is provided by re ligions of redemption. Aspiration toward redemption, "the content of which will be different depending upon what one wants to be saved from, and what one wants to be saved for,"46 is characteristic of many religions, especially as regards the notion of god and sin and, further, the moral sphere, and contacts with the world, especially at those points where specifically sacred religious relationships often go together with the "most serious utilitarian expectations." Thus, wealth is promised to the "ritually pure followers of the Eleusinian mysteries," to the Chinese by "exact observance of the official cult" and personal fulfillment of religious duties, to Zoro astrians, to those practicing the lay morality of Buddhism, to the devout Jew, and, in special cases, to the followers of the ascetic branches of Protestantism. The worldly consequence, with its sub sequent practical attitude toward life, is well illustrated by Weber in this particular instance of religious evolution. Redemption is most likely to acquire such a positive orientation to mundane affairs as the result of a conduct of life which is distinctively determined by religion and given coherence by some central meaning or positive goal. In other words, a quest for salvation in any religious group has the strongest chance of exerting practical influences when there has arisen, out of religious motivations, a sys tematization of practical conduct resulting from an orientation to certain inte gral values.47 This relationship, which is able to condition the conduct of life, and especially economic attitudes, should not, however, be seen as a necessary determinant, but rather as one simple element. In any</page><page sequence="99">84 MAX WEBER case, "The influence any religion exerts on the conduct of life, and especially on the conditions of rebirth, varies in accordance with the particular path to salvation which is desired and striven for, and in accordance with the psychological quality of the salvation in question."48 Weber notes two principle paths to redemption. The first, espe cially important, regards redemption as "the accomplishment of the individual himself without any assistance on the part of super natural powers."49 In this case, religious practices and purely ritual ceremonies, which are indispensable means for achieving redemption if they are inspired and rigidly maintained as a total regulation of life, would exclude any possibility of reconciliation with a worldly existence that is devoted, in exemplary fashion, to intensive economic gain. Of special importance indeed, above all for defining oriental religions, which are generally ritualistically hypertrophied, is that in ritualism the psychological condition striven for ultimately leads directly away from rational activity. Virtually all mystery cults have this effect. Theii typical intention is the administration of sacramental grace: redemption from guilt is achieved by the sheer sacredness of the manipulation. Like every form of magic, this process has a tendency to become diverted from everyday life, thereby failing to exert any influence upon it.50 When, however, the ritual state of mind is restricted to a mere sentimental attachment, discharged as regards the emotional con tent in the moment of devotion to produce a lower, transitory state, there is a "doubling" which makes possible greater freedom in "worldly" affairs. The rite is then really only a means for influ encing action outside the rite, and it is action which really is pri mary. "Then the works of salvation are primarily social achieve ments, distinctively differentf rom cultic performances, "51 deriving from the characterization of the ritualistic sense of religion in terms of the regulation of day-by-day ethics, through which the individual works out his religious destiny through the effective ser vices he renders seen as "symptoms and expressions of an under lying ethical total personality."52 The religious person who is conscious of realizing the will of god through his personal rational activity in this world (a god who remains inscrutable nonetheless as regards his ultimate meaning, combined with the understanding of the "meaning" of the world, in perfectly rational terms, seen as a unity transcending every factual reality) can demand as confirma</page><page sequence="100">WEBER AND MARX 85 tion of his state of grace his real confirmation as regards the order of the world. For him then, this "order" becomes a "vocation." In the conflict between certain elements of the earthly order with religious values, caused by the fact that no traditional body can fully respond to the requirements of a rationalized notion of the meaning of the universe, which thus produces the need for salva tion, Weber sees two possible attitudes, both compatible with a logical, rational understanding. These are the ascetic attitude in which earthly things are to some degree controlled and mastered in the interests of the religious ideal, and the mystical attitude in which these same earthly things are radically downgraded and insignificant. Both these positions are lived out in a radical form by only a minority of individuals. The first may be achieved, on the one hand, via "the mystical practice of the rejection of the world," wherein "concentration upon the actual pursuit of salvation may entail a formal withdrawal from the Tworldf: from social and psy chological ties with the family, from the possession of worldly goods, and from political, economic, artistic and erotic activities ? in short, from all creaturely interests,"53 and the formation of a "self-sufficient poverty" in the face of a concentrated activity in search of salvation. On the other hand, "inner-worldly ascetic ism," as has been noted, may require "participation within the world (or more precisely, within the institutions of the world but in opposition to them) on the basis of the religious individual's piety and his qualifications as the elect instrument of god."54 The second position, in which the particular gift of salvation is "a subjective condition of a distinctive kind, the most notable form of which is mystic illumination,"55 uses a systematic technique, "contemplation." It cuts itself off radically from mundane inter ests, and so achieves an indifference vis-a-vis the world, either by fleeing from it or by living in it but not being of it; this is "rejec tion of the world." Like the stereotyping action of symbolism as regards specific elements of culture, religion as the depository of the sacred, un changeable nature of a divine imperative works on the whole do main of the worldly order; by means of its absolute and changeless supremacy it checks the intense activity of rationalizing human institutions from law to economics. On the other hand, Weber notes how the breaking of magical norms or stereotypical rites by proph ecy may involve radical, acute, or gradual revolutions in the or dering of daily life, and especially the economy, as well. This may happen either through the dissolution of the "stereo</page><page sequence="101">86 MAX WEBER typing" of specific ritual norms, or through the setting up of a "holy consciousness," pliable and to some extent adaptable in dif ferent situations to reciprocally influencing relationships. Again, it may operate from within, on the basis of a management of be havior in life that is determinant, showing itself through a radi cally researched and internalized problematic. The more a religion of salvation has been systematized and internalized in the direction of an ethic of ultimate ends (Gesinnungsethik), the greater becomes its tension in relation to the world. This tension between religion and the world appears in a less consistent fashion and less as a matter of principle, so long as the religion has a ritualistic or legalistic form. In these earlier stages, re ligions of salvation generally assume the same forms and exert the same ef fects as those of magical ethics.56 The religious ethic enters into the terrain of the social order at very different depths. In this, not only differences between magical or ritual bonds, and those between different religions matter: 1Tln this stage, the religion exercises a stereotyping effect on the entire realm of legal institutions and social conventions, in the same way that symbolism stereotypes certain substantive elements of a cul ture and prescription of magical taboos stereotypes concrete types of relationships to human beings and to goods."57 Religious development thus seems relatively autonomous as re gards real economic conditions, and at the same time it acts on the development of economic structures through the various attitudes different forms of religion assume toward the world: these may be attitudes of indifference, rejection, or simple acceptance, or of action that transforms in a particular direction. The distinction between a world-rejecting asceticism and a worldly asceticism marks another stand taken by religion as regards economic life, and thus different economic ethics with a sequence of different economic results for the development of various forms of the econ omy. Weber's work on the sociology of religion abundantly demon strates his attitude. Different sociocultural contexts should be investigated without a priori hypostatization of any Gestalt or omnicomprehensive totality. In this sense, the contrast between the approaches of Weber and Marx could not be more basic.</page><page sequence="102">The Destiny of Reason In other works I have dealt extensively with the meaning of so ciology. My point is simple: The meaning of physics is humility before the power of nature (as Bacon said, TTNatura nonnisi parendo vincitur"). The meaning of sociology is dissatisfaction with the status quo, with the hope of its radical transformation. The des tiny of reason is thus central to sociological research ? it is its basic concern. However, this destiny can be no more than illu minated, and certainly not resolved, on the basis of a radical critique of the current social situation in order to transcend, and conceptually master, it. So, this critique requires assumptions. Once tradition goes into crisis as a source of formal, basic legiti macy, sociologists start to look for the bases of the new morality. Spencer's spontaneism is certainly insufficient. His society, which he still defines in terms of cooperation, is only the unstable equi librium resulting from a violent struggle between individual ego isms, a temporary fusion of individual appetites in the competition for the survival of the fittest. The problem should be put in differ ent terms: How does a society live; how is it formed? Where does it find its moral rules, its norms? How does one "invent" a so ciety? This is D?rkheimTs problem. How can one have a lay so ciety, an efficient social order, based on an organic, not simply mechanical, solidarity, when revelation and the supranatural basis are declining? D?rkheim makes a fundamental criticism of Comte's model, because it is too broad, generic, untestable, and, in short, not "positive" enough. Like Comte, on the other hand, he is afraid of the "anarchy" of individual judgment, and its opposition to psychology in the name of the "specificity of the social" ? in fact, because he is afraid of the dissolving of social bonds through the fleeting, capricious instability of individual tastes. Comte saw before him the ruins of the old regime. D?rkheim saw, every day, 87</page><page sequence="103">88 MAX WEBER bitterly, the decadence of civility and public morality behind the pomp and fatuousness of the Third Republic. C. Wright Mills, who as a good Texan admitted that he knew little about French sociology, is right all the same when he sees the concept of "anomie" as D?rkheimTs most important contribution to contemporary sociologi cal thought. Anomie describes a social situation in which literally the "laws," the norms of society have collapsed ? those points of collective reference for directing individual and group behavior. This is the negation of organic, conscious solidarity. According to D?rkheim, human groups, moving from simple, primitive so cieties toward forms of sociality that are more complex and dif ferentiated, based on social division of labor and its subsequent functional interdependence, find in mechanical solidarity a differ ent, organic solidarity. This is not only the condition for survival and progress, or a Hobbesian social contract, but a basic ethical value. Mechanical solidarity does not depend on choice. It is a fact of nature, the chance whereby one can be born in one family or another, in a given culture, in a particular period. Cold and unyielding, mechanical solidarity, like "the morality of the vil lage," is an extraneously imposed control from which one cannot escape; there are no alternatives. Organic solidarity, on the other hand, is not nature, but history. It originates from real human needs and develops on the basis of conscious choices. It is the ex pression of a common set of values and systems of meaning em bodied in the daily life of the group. Anomie is the pathology of organic solidarity, its withering and finally its disappearance. Hu man groups continue to live, but their cohesion is only apparent. They are united as an aggregate, in purely spatial closeness, elbow to elbow, but they do not feel themselves bound up in a common destiny; they have no shared values, experienced in common, and are only a "lonely crowd," in David RiesmanTs imaginative phrase. One thinks of Lewis Mumford and his "megalopolis," which be comes a "necropolis," or of Georg Simmel and the whole question of "intellectualization," the intellectual, "dessicated" quality of metropolitan life, and also of returning to the antiurban polemic of the English romantics; the latter lived through the first "indus trial revolution" and thus anticipated its human problems with ex traordinary clarity, destined to nourish legions of boring imitators. Here again there is a basic question. The primal misunderstand ing of sociology, in fact, is to be found in the postulate that ration ality coincides with preciseness, the mathematizing raison of the Enlightenment. The whole methodological, basic effort of post</page><page sequence="104">THE DESTINY OF REASON 89 systemic sociology, as I see it, was to try to get away from that misunderstanding. It is true in the first place for Max Weber. He was linked to the great tradition of German historicism, and cen tral to the Methodenstreit, which painfully seeks a mediation be tween nature and history, an existential, biographical experience, unique and unrepeatable, and a scientific "law" ? an explanatory causal or conditional scheme, capable of explaining phenomena and predicting their development by means of their relatively uniform aspects. In the light of this, Weber seems torn by contradictions. The thinker who seems to have placed the neutrality of the scholar on a theoretical plane, via the almost universally misunderstood principle of "value freedom," suffers from the problems and shares in the destiny of Wilhelmine Germany with unusual intensity. Weber replaces D?rkheimTs "social fact" with "social action" or even "acting" (Handeln) as the strategic theme of sociological research. This is always individual, fluid, problematic action, in tension, which becomes social indeed insofar as it continuously considers, during its concrete unfolding, the possible reactions of others. The interests of the individual, his assumptions and ideas, are the point of departure. The function of social science, or cul ture, as he preferred to call it, lies in clarifying for the individual those rational alternatives that lie before him, or connecting the ends desired to the means at his disposal. Industrial society, in sofar as it appeared to be based on the relation between means and ends, was seen by him as a basically rational one, formally orga nized in an impersonal fashion, anonymous, whose function continu ously developed through time and was discharged independently of the individual, or the official, to whom it was entrusted. However, Weber was quite aware that this involved a fragile, indeed a formal, rationality. Throughout his life he was obsessed by a question which recurs in all his work, explicitly or implicitly: What if Marx was right? What if the economic structure, on its own or as a basic prius, was the decisive force in social development? What would happen to the "realm of ideas"? What would be the destiny of reason? This is the profound meaning of the investigation of relations be tween ethics and the economic world, between religions and pro ductive and distributive systems. This does not involve a petty anti-Marxist polemic, as Lukacs seems to think. It is an attempt to test the Marxian hypothesis by concentrating on its unilaterality, its grandiose design of seeing social reality as the meeting point of a multitude of physical, economic, psychological, and ethico</page><page sequence="105">90 MAX WEBER cultural factors which interact in a connected and global manner. However, the more important question, that of the rationality of industrial society, its nature and limits, is still open. It was to be the task of the great demystifiers of the first half of this century to establish its real terms and identify its specific modes of devel opment. The guiding thread is the idea of progress. This binds and unites the sociologists of the "systematic" age. The means for guaranteeing and realizing progress may diverge to the point of mutually contradicting each other, but the end is not to be con tested, and it is shared. The diversity of means proposed does not interfere with the conventional notion that a new saturnia aetas may be possible ? means such as the rational organization of society, the scientization of political decision, or the idea of justice, which needs to be transformed into a power idea, or the spontaneity of private initiatives, or the translation of scientific interpretation into projects for political struggle and the winning of power. Sys tematic sociologists, even when they speak of injustice and aliena tion, still have the nice feeling of being firmly inserted into history, of knowing exactly what one wants and why, and of having no doubts about the final outcome. On the other hand, what representative sociologists of the first half of this century have in common is the wary attitude of one who has learned not to trust in ideological prophecy and is not burning to put forward proposals and schemes for tomorrow's world; in stead, a cautious tendency, shot through with skepticism, to ask oneself what is "behind" a doctrine, and the need to see clearly the practical origin of a theoretical position. Having rejected the idea of putting forward plans for social reconstruction, the sociologists "demystify" and restrict themselves to asking for further investi gation. The arrogance of yesteryear is but a memory. This task of demystification was begun very rigorously by Marx. It has been noted that all Marx's important works express their critical intention in their titles ? The Critique of Hegel's Philoso phy of Right, the Introduction to the Critique of Political Econ omy, and so forth. But what is striking and makes us think is the extraordinary continuity of that underground critical current which finds unexpected outlets, infiltrates various areas of thought and obviously contrasting intellectual tendencies, establishes subtle, mysterious links of intellectual complicity ? Marx with Veblen, Pareto, Michels, Mannheim, and Marcuse. Veblen first: The great provoker, sly, allusive; a resourceful writer, in an English that is polysyllabic, Latinizing, and sinuous,</page><page sequence="106">THE DESTINY OF REASON 91 and unexpectedly sometimes dry and withering, as though all the previous passages had only been patient preparations for an am bush. Dos Passos put it well in Big Money ? that he wove a long rope for society to hang itself on. The expansive Marxist hope for a genuine workers' internationalism beyond national frontiers, and the rationality of economic behavior, are the myths Veblen meets head on. With exceptional insight, and much before the profes sional political observers, Veblen foresaw the breakup of interna tional working class solidarity even before World War I. In his Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution he argued (as against the optimism of the current Socialist International) that any exploitation of the "predatory and sporting attitudes" of the German working masses would easily suffice to bind them to the bellicose, "barbaric" designs of the small groups that controlled big finance capital and were at the root of recent European political adventures. Reading Veblen, and however distant and "anthropolog ico-cultural" it may sound, one is forced to remember the spectre of the choral totalitarianisms of our day with their clever manipu lation of "sporting loyalties" among the mass. More: In the United States of Wilson's "new freedom," of the twenties, a country that had only recently discovered mass produc tion, a country that contained in its Puritan foundations a cult of efficiency, this languid son of Norwegian farmers rose up to attack, indeed with the peasant's concern for detail, the typical "heroes" of American society, the businessmen, whether captain of industry or financier ? Dreiser's Titan and Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Veblen's attack is more comprehensive and penetrating than Marx's. It is not limited to structures, but follows its victim to the roots of his psychological motives. He demonstrates these for the enlight enment of the reader, but without excessive illusions: the erratic decisions, the almost congenital irrationality, "honorific consump tion," and "conspicuous consumption," but primarily the old "bar baric," "predatory" custom of doing business on the backs of others, either by war or by economic crises (the fluctuations of that supreme smiling Providence, the market). Veblen's analysis leads to a black-and-white picture. On the one hand we have the "engineer," ready to promote technical progress and able to understand its logic, but without fixed interests which might lead him to speculate on the scarcity of goods and be come a parasitic absentee owner (many of the praises Veblen sings of the engineer return almost literally, if with less elegance, in C. P. Snow's contemporary discussion of the scientist in The Two</page><page sequence="107">92 MAX WEBER Cultures and the Scientific Revolution). On the other hand, we have the negation, and the caricature, of enterprise ? not so much the captain of industry as the mere speculator, the "captain of busi ness," who makes money from the fluctuations and subsequent re adjustments (interstitial adjustments) in difficult economic situa tions and who buys and sells businesses and firms without ever having set foot in a factory. He is the manipulator of the "neutral flow" of money, in Georg Simmers term, through which everything is reduced to a homogeneous, grey and uniform quantity. In the solitude of Palo Alto, where he died, Veblen was too disenchanted to claim to know where we were going. Only silence and the bitter defense of irony remained. VeblenTs demystification of classical economics has its analogy in the work of Pareto and Michels on political democracy. Espe cially in Anglo-Saxon countries, Pareto, after an initial period of popularity in the thirties (his Trattato di Sociologia, translated and abridged with the title The Mind and Society, was a best-seller), had the misfortune to become regarded as a fascist ? the theorist of the use of force in social relations and by definition the critic of democracies. Those who meddle with popular myths always run certain risks. The truth is that among sociologists the only one who can measure up to Pareto is Marx. These are two great "un maskers." Obviously, they are different. One is an Italian aristo crat, the other a German professor. The first was Voltairian, un conventional and naturally iconoclastic, but also an industrial man ager, a real organizer and meticulous administrator (one need only read the letters he sent to the administration of the canton of Vaud regarding his salary increases as professor of economics at Lau sanne). Marx was an Hegelian malgre lui and a revolutionary, serious but capable of unforgettable sarcasm and biblical outrage. The common point is provided by the need to clarify the real con ditions of relations, breaking through the crust of "ideal super structures." Reading Pareto one sees clearly the great amusement he derives when he wittily overturns the progressive, humanitarian ideals of the enlightened bourgeoisie of his day. Subdividing men's actions into logical and nonlogical, he shows that the typical activity of man is the nonlogical, especially when it comes to politics. The numerous examples of nonlogical social actions Pareto adduced in the Trattato betray all too clearly his taste for socking liberal democratic rationalism. He implicitly seems to say: It is all quite different from rational choices by the individual, and from the general progress of humanity guaranteed by the struggle against</page><page sequence="108">THE DESTINY OF REASON 93 illiteracy and by universal suffrage. In every culture and every period, basically the same taboos and magic, the same personal abstractions, evidence of the nonlogical tendency in man, exist. The forms may change, but the basic part remains unchanged. Ancient divinities like Athena and Janus are replaced by others such as "Progress" and "Humanity." The hymns to Jupiter become today's invocations to the people and to democratic institutions. The magic of the vote and electoral manipulation supplant the magic of "wax dolls" and "sorcerers' wands." Faith in progress replaces revealed religion to all effects. Man is not a rational animal. Un der the thin film of rationality there slumbers an instinctive, non logical being, swinging between the poles of craftiness and force, alternately fox and lion. Later, a not unworthy successor to the tradition of the Italian elitist school (Mosca, Pareto, and if you wish, Machiavelli before them), Roberto Michels, posed the theory of "the iron law of oli garchic tendencies." Michels writes skillfully, but his "law" is such only by means of gross approximation. It is more a happily summarized formulation of organizational phenomena of which he had direct experience and which could be read in the newspapers than a law, a well defined and tested working hypothesis. It has been said that Michels wrote with scissors, that he collected as evidence newspaper cuttings, anecdotes, and odd or in any way sug gestive facts. Certainly, he can be seen as a precursor of Vance Packard. The success his book Political Parties now enjoys in the United States, based on his 1912 La sociologia del partito politico nella democrazia moderna, is not fortuitous. The new fact to note is that Michels touches on the internal life of organizational struc tures with an eye for the discrepancy between official ideological credo and real power and authority relations. The masses are in capable of autonomous, first-person expression. Democracy is necessarily a regime of organizations, but they are tendentially oligarchic, antidemocratic. The reply made by the democrats to this argument is well known: that Michels was looking for democ racy within individual organizations, such as the parties and the unions, which as a whole, not singly and still less in terms of their internal relations, make up democracy. An organization is an or ganism with precise ends that must be achieved. The level of its functionality can be determined on the basis of its ability to realize its own specific objectives ? which can never be democracy as such. On the contrary, democracy and the democratic order are the result of interaction ? of the competitive interchange and recip</page><page sequence="109">94 MAX WEBER rocal control among the different individual organizations, such that no one of them dominates at the expense of the others, and above all at the expense of the concrete possibility that any one might achieve domination. According to the defenders of multi party competitive democracy, it consists essentially in the possi bility, institutionally guaranteed to all citizens, of choosing between alternative forms of servitude. In my view, MichelsTs interest for us lies elsewhere, in the first glimpses of the question Mannheim and Marcuse were to locate at the basis of the development ? or the involution ? of industrial society and its human significance. This is the question of the re lationship between the original guiding function, which is not fore seen and is of necessity unforeseeable, and the standardized re quirements of centralized organization, between creativity and ef ficiency, the intellectual and the bureaucrat. Where is industrial society going? What is the role, the function of the intellectual in this kind of society? Is his function still definable, or is the intellectual simply someone who has not yet found a job? The technological unemployment, so to speak, of the intellectual in a society that has resolved, or is resolving, all its problems gradually, without ever needing to go beyond itself ? to counterpose itself to itself, hypothesizing and presenting radical, qualitative, global alternatives ? is largely an inescapable result. Yet it is difficult now to believe in an optimistic construct ? that this is a case that calls only for technical retraining, as in the case of workers who lose their jobs as a result of automation. It is true that intellectual labor is the last artisan-type work; but one must ask, with Marcuse, if its disappearance does not represent a dead loss for human life, its irreversible impoverishment and its re duction to "one-dimensional humanity." This is still Weber's major problem: the passage from formal to substantial rationality. In dustrial society is rational from a formal legal point of view; that is, it is rational in the sense that, like a machine, it can take ac count in terms of efficiency, calculation, and prediction of its own movements, but cannot tell us much about the reasons for the move ments themselves. As with the movement of a machine, which in Heidegger's phrase is but "the everlasting return of the identical," the rationality of industrial society does not go beyond the inherent correctness of its own operations. It has only internal goals, and cannot escape from "doing for its own sake," just as it cannot pose objectives outside itself without denying its own logic, without transcending itself. It is a society that spreads out horizontally,</page><page sequence="110">THE DESTINY OF REASON 95 tolerates no residues, and coopts everything; it is a society without utopia, and thus without opposition. The task of sociology today is to put this society in crisis by means of research directed toward specific, circumscribed human needs. The destiny of reason, or to put it another way, reason's capability of becoming reasonable, depends on the "recapture" of these real needs, needs not inspired by propaganda or pursued and satisfied only on the basis of a canon of honorific waste for purposes of social prestige. Weber links this question to points of view, the "interests" of the individual. However, where do these points of view or subjective interests find their justification? This is the basic difficulty which underlies Weber's whole project. For instance, Weber classifies the pure types of sovereignty on the basis of the principles on which they are founded. Sovereignty is the "chance" of finding obedience in a human group based on the possession of economic goods, but above all on authority. Power should be seen as "the probability that certain specific commands (or all commands) will be obeyed by a given group of persons. It thus does not include every mode of exercising 'power' or 'influence' over other persons."1 In other words, custom and the system of interests cannot form "a sufficiently reliable basis for a given domination. In addition, there is normally a further element, the belief in legitimacy."2 Every authority seeks legitimacy according to the type of legiti macy its power claims. Thus a different power structure, and a different form of obedience on the part of the people, is produced. The principles of legitimacy derived from this premise are tradi tional, rational, and charismatic. But why isolate and select the motive of legitimacy rather than another, by means of which a dif ferent theory of power could be formulated? Both the criterion of selection and differentiation, and the construction of "utopian," abstractly rational conceptual frameworks are to a large degree arbitrary. Weber confirms these doubts when he argues that the whole question of science can be reduced to the factual thesis that there are "many, indeed countless, practical questions in the dis cussion of which there seems to be general agreement about the self-evident character of certain goals."3 Weber's scientific ideal is purely "rational." However, this is not Kantian rationality, morality, but rather a practical one of "adequacy." For him, whatever the rational impulses and suggestions men experience, actions exam - ined on the basis of the criterion of coherence or conformity of means and end, always partake of the rationality of concrete knowledge, and the intelligibility of social action in all its complexity.</page><page sequence="111">96 MAX WEBER The other basic characteristic of science is that involving its problematic nature: TTt is not the 'actual' interconnections of things1 but the conceptual interconnections of problems which de fine the scope of the various sciences. A new Science' emerges where new problems are pursued by new methods and truths are thereby discovered which open up significant new points of view."4 Science, in Weber's view, must first of all confine itself to ex pounding the possible points of view whence one may arrive at oneTs object, to discuss the different paths that can lead to the chosen goal, and weigh the consequences ? including the unwanted ones ? that of necessity follow from them. Furthermore, it must express a judgment concerning the greater or lesser adequacy of the tech nical means used to realize the choice made, and propose means in view of the goals and values chosen, thereby committing people to see the facts ? especially the embarrassing and "inconvenient" ones. What is the basis of these limits, and why should science see its own "law" in them? Weber argues that science cannot avoid re specting them. From the moment when its judgment on the appro priateness of the technical relation between ends and means passes over into a value judgment on the choice or the value chosen, it finds itself "embroiled" in "affairs of faith," personal ideals. By restricting itself to detail, it would deny itself. As has been observed, science should not and cannot pronounce on taking sides as it cannot set up any criterion for accepting or rejecting any stand. Science has nothing to say in this respect because, as Weber repeatedly stresses, choice precedes, rather than follows, scientific work; the mistake most threatening to the objectivity of science is to believe that the taking up of a position follows, and thus that it might be the result of scientific analysis. Furthermore, as regards the correctness of a choice, one cannot refer to science since then indeed it has completed its task. Weber says that there are many gods to whom one can pray. Since the "savior," the "prophet," is not yet here, rather than becoming tenured professors we must wait. In the darkness surrounding us, the only possibility we have is to serve a science that abstains from judging, and rejects the claim of being basic to the construc tion of a W eltans chauung. It has been observed that Weber's distinction between judging and knowing, value judgments and science, slips into evasion, if not "neoromantic rhetoric." However, one must acknowledge that it may yet thereby conceal "the most rigorous, effective criticism</page><page sequence="112">THE DESTINY OF REASON 97 of the values of its time, since that abstention from every judg ment reveals a deep distaste for the existing dominant beliefs in the cultural world of his time, and because he devotes to that dis tinction his most bitter and severe judgment on the switch effected by his contemporaries between ideology and truth."5 However, he does not manage to effect the transition from formal to substantial rationality. He states that it is not only intellect that is committed to the attempt to understand the world of experience, but the whole man, just as the historical world is intelligible only through this total participation. As against the neo-Kantians, he argues that the premises of "understanding" are not pure a priori forms, but con crete, determinate interests. However, the concern to save science from confusion and ulti mate failure leads him to believe that the only certainty science has is that of the "modes," the "formal structures," of its proce dure. Thus, at the very instant he affirms its importance for modern society, Weber voids it. Bureaucratic rationality is es sential for satisfying the normal, daily needs of the community. However, when it is faced with historical crises and extraordinary needs that can no longer be confronted with the traditional weapons of simple legality, then there emerges the natural, charismatic leader who is not an office holder nor the holder of a professional qualification. This notion of the charismatic leader also marks the limit of Weber's contribution. It does in fact mean a rejection of a rationality that is not purely formal in favor of one that makes the judgment of the community react on the leader's decisions by way of a kind of social feedback, through which, historically, a humanization of power emerges. This task cannot be done properly and discharged positively in terms of bureaucratic rationality, which reaches its peak in unilateral technocratic decisions, from the summit to the base. It is certainly one of Weber's great merits that he saw clearly the problem presented by the bureaucratization of modern society. To him, this process cannot be arrested, nei ther does history provide examples of bureaucracies which have moved towards decomposition independently of the decline of a civilization as a whole. We can only stem this process by slowing it down, and we must do this. It is terrible to think that the world might one day be full of nothing more than little cog-wheels, little men clinging to little occupations which set bigger ones in motion.... This bureaucratic travail leads to despair.. .and the world could one day see only men of this type: it is in the development of such a state of affairs that we are already entangled, and the major problem consequently does</page><page sequence="113">98 MAX WEBER not revolve around how it is possible to advance and accelerate it, but the means, on the contrary, by which to oppose this mechanism so as to keep part of humanity from from such a dismemberment of the soul, this absolute domi nation of a bureaucratic notion of life.6 Weber was not able to elaborate on the means he evoked, nor to provide them for us. However, he gave a decisive blow to the traditional viewpoint of the social sciences, which was satisfied with formal, systematic constructs based on one-way relations between active subjects and passive objects. His pessimism re garding the intelligence, and his optimism regarding the will, are still exemplary for todayTs sociologist.</page><page sequence="114">Postscript This book had the good fortune to inspire many, particularly polemical, reviews both in Italy and abroad. There emerged a wide debate, wholly spontaneous and not confined to the modest dialogue of specialist reviews. It rapidly overflowed into the col umns of the dailies, and managed, in my view, to dust off and ex plore the basic problems with which contemporary sociological analysis must come to terms. I do not wish to nourish illusions, in myself or in the reader. This is not the place to sum up such a settling of accounts. At any rate, as I am afraid I shall not be able to reply to all the reviewers, I must content myself as far as possible with replying only to those points on which a clarification by the author may seem useful. This, to begin, is the case as regards the very acute comments of Kurt H. Wolff.1 Wolff criticized me basically on two matters: for not having dealt exhaustively with Weber the politician, or the politician manque, and then for not having explicitly considered the value assumptions that constitute the nineteenth-century notion of the European liberal tradition (individual freedom, dignity, the sense of fairness, respect perhaps not for justice as such, but for the rules of the game). Weber, even when speaking of the "poly theism of values," took this for granted and as beyond discussion ? as a permanent acquisition of mankind, within whose limits in dividual choices must necessarily have free play and expression. This criticism is only partly justified. As regards the first point, I should just make clear that I cannot be held to account for something I never intended to do. This book evaluates, "uses," Weber as an emblematic figure, even as a personalized, polemical intention, but within a group of problems that go beyond the facts of his biography and are in fact more alive for us than for him. The specific political positions adopted by Weber seem to me today 99</page><page sequence="115">100 MAX WEBER to be devoid of theoretical and practical interest, except retro spectively. This is his general, almost obsessive concern: What will happen to the realm of ideas in a bureaucratized society that is "disenchanted," and whose soul is "dismembered" and "prole tarianized"? We have been accustomed to considering a rational - positivistic Weber, a Weber as cornerstone for the worked-out designs of Talcott Parsons. It seemed correct to me to choose a term like "destiny" ? the destiny of reason ? to restore the gen eral sense of his wholly unsystematic enquiries. These were open to the problems of the present (the phrase in der Gegenwart crops up like a leitmotiv), shot through with intuition, erudite tours de force, crises and retractions, and in places almost anxious, and moving. Weber the politician certainly has his importance, and I shall shortly return to this. The elitist limits of his makeup will be clarified so as to show the falseness of the dilemma he places in the path of democratic development, beyond the nineteenth cen tury formulas of a democracy of notables: that is, either democ racy led by the Fuhrer or a government by faction, disarticulation and a fall into the swamp of the camarilla. That Weber should have seen no way out except by magic, through the charismatic leader and the divine inspiration he embodies, seems to me a crude, ir rationalist residue whose tragic, immanent reality he was not able to evaluate. It is only with greater difficulty that I can shake off Wolff's sec ond criticism. This concerns the insufficiently illustrated analysis of Weber's value assumptions. I recognize that I am impatient and sometimes tend to treat important thinkers strictly according to my own aims, without much ceremony and even with an element of irreverence. Indeed, it has never occurred to me to write a book in the frame of mind of someone who is writing a dissertation. I am almost contradictory in my liking for digressions and short cuts. Let's call it a chaos with aesthetic justifications. More pre cisely ? and here I think Wolff will agree ? I follow an internal problem, one that dominates and grows day and night into an ob session to which I firmly subordinate everything, and for which everything becomes fuel for the experiment, expendable. A thinker and philologist of Wolff's refinement, able to follow a thought ? always the same one ? patiently and subtly through the undergrowth of different periods and authors ? like the tail of a comet ? can only turn up his nose. However, at the same time he cannot be unaware that I have a plan, and that Weber, D?rkheim, Mannheim, Parsons, and Marcuse do not in this case stand for themselves,</page><page sequence="116">POSTSCRIPT 101 but rather have their own part to play. Wolff knows and states this, when he argues that the answers I am seeking are to be found in the theoretical, conceptual framework of "sociology as participation"; and for this I am grateful to him. He has seen very clearly what I am looking for, the "substantial reason underlying recognition of human needs insofar as these change historically only within de finable limits," within, that is, an "historical horizon." However, the conclusion, putting me brusquely in the company of Marcuse ("a radical social critique of the Marcusean type"), needs a correction. I have great respect for Herbert Marcuse and for his attempt at an impossible reconciliation (a kind of lay Trin ity) of Hegel, Marx, and Freud. Elsewhere I have remarked that the critique against industrial society that Marcuse has been devel oping for some time, especially in Eros and Civilization, and more recently in One-dimensional Man, contains cues that must not be exhausted and discarded. However, I have always hastened to add that in this critique there is also present the mortal danger of philosophical presumptuousness, which, in order to transcend the empirical given, ends up by neglecting it as useless, an irrelevant stumbling block in the path of the enquiry. This aspect of Mar cuse's work, which, after all is its characteristic approach ? this urgent, violent hubris which makes it impatient in the face of the tiny details of circumscribed, historically determined experience, the fascinating mixture of swift intelligence and aristocratic dis tance ? has an immediate correspondence with the man himself. Tall, with a youthful complexion, big but not fat, with the still thick, silver hair of a celebrated Middle European conductor, he has an upright, almost solemn stance, strangely bent back like one who always keeps his distance, or like a poplar against the wind. It is no wonder that with him conversation is difficult, discon nected, like a tete-?-tete with a beautiful woman. Clearly, he is a man who knows how, and wants, to say "no," who explains and subtly defends the liberating power of negative thought; but it would be simplistic, perhaps even ingenuous, to rush into arguing that this concerns only someone with a facility for protest. I am flat tered that Wolff should put me with Marcuse, though I must im mediately make my position clear. Were he not almost wholly immersed in historicity, and if human experience did provide at least a metahistorical margin, I should see in Marcuse a compat ible fellow-traveler of Camus Ts homme revolte. As it is, he is still, among all modern writers on social matters, the most genu ine representative of dialectical impatience: more rigorous than</page><page sequence="117">102 MAX WEBER Adorno, more logical than Horkheimer. It is the paradox of an existence naturally pushed to marginal situations, where the con tradictions mature, are aggravated, and explode, that he should thus have chosen (as against the Dioscuri of the Frankfurt school) to carry on living and working in the United States. In the heart of that suburban sadness and pullulating flatness which seem to him the sign of internal American stagnation, in that political and cultural situation, every problem tends to be seen and tackled in a framework of judicious minimalism ? scientifically, that is, on the basis of a positive estimate of the means available and their adequacy as regards the ends desired. The book in which one can most clearly see the reasons for dif ferentiating Marcuse's positions, and that which in my view, allows one to get out of the shallows of abstract, or mystified, dialectical reasoning, is probably Reason and Revolution. This is a passion ate defense of Hegel. It is also, in retaliation, an attack (so fierce as to emerge as sophistry) on positivism and on Auguste Comte in particular. The defense of Hegel is difficult, especially for anyone undertaking the elimination of the practical political implications of Hegelian thought, the justification and glorification of Prussian absolutism ? an anticipation, more than a little disturbing, of the "ethical State." Above all it is difficult now that the memory and experience of this century's totalitarianisms are still fresh and present. At the biographical level, the defense is impossible. Karl Rosenkranz, the official biographer of Hegel who was com missioned by the widow, himself abstained from getting involved in biographical data and from setting out the caprices and the in credibly shabby animosities of Hegel the academic. This need had already been foreseen by his great contemporary, Schopenhauer (see especially The Philosophy of the Universities). Sidney Hook has recently come back to this theme, in an essay titled "Hegel's Apologists."2 To his and other similar demands, however, Marcuse can always propose a simple fin de non recevoir. Indeed, he is dealing with ideas, not biographical curiosities, with theory, not psychology. His basic thesis is quickly expressed. Hegelian dialectical thought, in its genuine interpretation, is a cor rosive acid, transcending the pure givenness of experience. It does not stop at empirically revealed facts: it directs one in principle to the totality, to the global meaning, and is thus critical, antidog matic, and liberating. The exposition of this thesis is a bravura piece and occupies the whole of the first part of Reason and Revolution.3 The second part</page><page sequence="118">POSTSCRIPT 103 is devoted to the exposition of the perversion of those needs that lie at the basis of Hegelian thought; in other words, the "fall," connected with the confusion between "reason" and "intellect," or between dialectical thought and "abstract scientific," "positivistic" thought, which precedes the rise of "social theory." With the same eagerness with which in the first part he takes care to free Hegel from the reputation of being a "fascist totalitarian," still less a justifier of the Prussian state, Marcuse then tries to establish the conception of Comte as the prophet of reaction and political dogma tism. However, the attempt does not seem to me to go much be yond an interesting collection of quotations cobbled together for polemical reasons, out of context. The overall result is a harsh attack launched against sociology and generally against all the so cial sciences. The violence of the attack can be seen in Marcuse's language. For example, "Comte begins his propaganda for posi tivism. .." (p. 345). Yet this "propaganda" must be fairly well thought-out if a thinker like Marcuse devotes dozens of pages to it. These are MarcuseTs lines of argument: "Resignation is a basic note in ComteTs writings, deriving directly from the acceptance of the principle of the invariability of social laws" (p. 381). This res ignation, or submission to the real (the recognition of empirical facts as absolutely fundamental), is opposed to the traditional the ological and speculative notions. But Marcuse, echoed in his own way and in various keys by Adorno and disciples, argues that this recognition of the facts, common to positivism and to sociology, as to all modern sciences of nature as well as "culture" (to use the formula Rickert and Weber prefer to Dilthey's "sciences of the spirit"), in reality means digestion, absorption, or annihilation of the facts that are no longer conceptually capable of being mastered. Indeed, "Positivism.. .gradually substituted for thought understood as free spontaneity, a thought whose functions were predominantly receptive" (p. 343). The skill with which Marcuse makes his argument, using pre cisely selected quotations, is undeniable; but his conclusion is un tenable. Far from being consumed by elementary facts, Comte never tires of invoking "the clear indication of a preliminary theory... without which the observer would not even know.. .what he has to examine in the fact appearing before his eyes."4 Far from wanting to justify, if not install, a totalitarian dictatorship, Comte, in the disturbed postrevolutionary world, was concerned to find a new basis of social consensus; he thought he had identified it in the "scientization" of political judgment, or in a political judgment</page><page sequence="119">104 MAX WEBER removed from personal idiosyncrasies, as though from the weight of the dead hand of tradition. Is it excessive to see in Comte the precursor of the processes of rational socioeconomic planning now in existence, or at least being planned, both in the East and the West? Possibly, though it is hard to deny that even today his importance is linked to a pre cise, incontestable fact ? that he saw with extraordinary acuteness the connection joining science and society. Marx correctly fore saw massive industrialization. Proudhon has the undoubted his torical value of having underlined the advantages of federalist polit ical structures. Comte grasped the social importance of science, and described the essential character of industrial society as one based on rational, all-inclusive calculation in which class struggle itself came to be included as part of the pluralistic interplay of interests: an organized and socio-centric society. Above all, he understood that science could no longer be seen as an individual fact, suspended between esoteric practice and witchcraft, but rather as a most powerful instrument of social analysis and transforma tion. It is strange that on this aspect of Comte Ts thought Marcuse has nothing to say. The problems that he raises are by no means phantasms, but his conceptual frame of reference, his perspective, and the general direction of his enquiry do not seem to me to avoid the sorry re sult of an almost decadent catastrophism. They remain as re minders, danger signals, and pedagogic warnings rather than sci entific propositions. Their very suggestiven ess in any case places them outside any attempt to verify them empirically in the strict sense. The need for totality, the necessity for a global vision, the withering of human reason into the purely taxonomic faculty of ab stract intellect, the dehumanization of science and so forth, are concerns that turn up in different periods and authors, from John Ruskin to Horkheimer (The Eclipse of Reason) and von Hayek (The Counter-revolution of Science). I do not want to set them aside with a gesture of distaste, as has been attempted. They in volve real problems, though even with the scientific means now at our disposal we cannot fully express them in operative, verifiable terms. A piece of evidence like that in Darwin's Autobiography cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed: My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of that</page><page sequence="120">POSTSCRIPT 105 part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive... if I had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intel lect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature. I do not know if Marcuse would be pleased were we to use Dar win's words as a comment on and criticism of his theory of "one dimensional" man, man so integrated as to appear flattened, so bonded to the "given," so careful to "accept facts" as to reduce himself ? now distant from really human problems, from the sense of technically nonresolvable tensions ? to a "fact," a thing, a num ber, a stage in a standardized process whose terms and motivation, if there are any, escape him and fall outside his control. I should subscribe to Wolff's definition of me as "Marcusean" had Marcuse undertaken his own analysis to give more detail and awareness to the basic contradiction of our times ? the pressing reality of the physical sciences, which have, in the name of objectivity, lost sight of their human aim; and, at the same time, the humanistic sciences, which, at the very moment they are entrusted with the "noble values" and human content, can no longer speak the words of everyday truth. All the more, too, because I hear in Marcuse here and there the subterranean murmur of notions and formula tions I find in the young, less well-known Hegel, from time to time mystical and demoniacal, shadowy and prophetic. Instead, it seems clear to me that in One-dimensional Man Marcuse, in passages that often indulgently skip from the meta physical plane to the journalistic-impressionistic or from the theoretical level to that of the most disconnected and deficient empirico-descriptive observation, has polemized against posi tivism ? historical, logical, and linguistic ? without, however, offering alternative solutions in the last resort. He acknowledges the value of positive thought, which puts the principle of authority in crisis by recalling one to experience and empirical validation and thus laying the basis, historically, for rational struggle against obscurantist myths and mystifications. However, he does not go beyond the untenable conception of positivism as the mere accumu lation of fragmentary empirical data. As a good romantic revolu tionary, he sniffs out the limit in the fact ? in every fact, in the voice of factual commonsense, in the reasonableness of concrete things. Above all, he fears that the investigation of the fact might</page><page sequence="121">106 MAX WEBER rise up before thought as an impassable limit. He is afraid that the analytical datum that has not been transcended, experienced in its dense "factuality," may lead thought to reject a total perspective, conceptually capable of dominating the globality of the social pro cess and of connecting human ends to this without suffering their mechanical logic, without deluding oneself that the ends are already present, necessarily implicit in the mechanical rules of its func tion. I share this concern for totality. The empirical "given" has no cognitive value; in its isolation, left to itself, it is literally absurd. It has a value, it "speaks," if placed systematically in relation to social totality and if it is seen in dialectical relation to the position of the social system, viewed as a global system of forces that con front each other dialectically and mutually condition each other. This, after all, is the basic condition that provides social research with its orientation and saves it from a baseless fragmentation and manipulatory temptations. On the contrary, what seems to me unresolved in Marcuse, as in Adorno and others, concerns the question of the relation between analytical datum and dialectical synthesis, empirical enquiry and connection with global society. The theorist's impatience here leaves us open to grave danger. When, in the Critique de la raison dialectique, Sartre invokes totalization in order to escape from the realm of reformist reasonableness, and talks generically about patron, ouvrier, and so forth, without specifying or bothering to define the level of skill or the stage of development of ownership with which we are dealing, he is talking in elemental archetypes and is expounding nineteenth-century platonism. Totality runs the risk of being reduced to an empty totality; the synthesis is more willed than achieved. It remains a verbal game, saved by its literary sug gestiven ess. It seems to me that Marcuse does not emerge from this much better. His bits of empirical backing are often quotations from the New York Times, or occasional statements by union leaders, in dustrialists, and so on. This is too little: it is too fragile an em pirical basis to support that imposing theoretical superstructure. We are still in an essentially idealist, "conceptuological" perspec tive. The demand for totality is of pure Hegelo-Marxist origin. Today, we recognize that this is a major qualification for seeing Marx as one of the founders (and not the least of them) of sociology. The synoptic framework of research, characteristic of sociological</page><page sequence="122">POSTSCRIPT 107 analysis, owes much to him. The most acute Marxists ? the stu dents of a nonpetrified Marxism, those who do not limit themselves to seeing it as a bloc of propositions solidified into dogma ? are well aware of this. It is this awareness that permeates the critical comments on my book by Mario Spinella,6 Stefano Garroni,7 Cos imo Pergola,8 Luciano Vernetti,9 and Aldo Zanardo.10 Clearly, their intellectual perspectives are different. However, one element in common seems to me to be the intention of freeing Marxism from the reputation of being a nineteenth-century, metaphysical type of Weltanschauung. They do not, nevertheless, lose sight of the methodological and substantial need for totality, which I see, even in Marx, as being logically closed off for obvious instrumental objective reasons; they propose to interpret this as a relative to tality, to avoid confusion. They are naturally in agreement with a total, conclusive, arid knowledge. Yet, to my great satisfaction, Spinella and Garroni in particular emphasize the need for the ori entation of sociological research not only, and not so much, as an ethical requirement or a generically human one, but primarily as a basic prerequisite of the cognitive kind, that is, as a methodolog ical requirement. Certainly some time it will also be necessary to resolve to clar ify why Marx is so decisively important for sociological analysis and in what sense there burns in Marxism (especially in the young Marx, but also in Capital) a sociological priority directed toward tackling the social phenomenon globally and in a coordinated man ner, so as to relate every specific analysis to the state of the sys tem as such. Merleau-Ponty puts it well: If we referred not only to Marx's and Engels's formulas but to Marx's work it self, we would see that he set no limit to the immanent study of diplomacy, to the effectiveness of diplomatic action. He spent long days at the British Museum digging through diplomatic manuscripts concerning the Anglo-Russian collaboration of Peter the Great up to the end of the eighteenth century, and devoting a detailed study to them in which economic and social history play only an unobtrusive role. How could it be otherwise? Marxism did not want to be one of those "points of view," those "conceptions of the world," those "philosophies of history" which order reality about an arbitrarily chosen principle, but the expression of reality ? the formulation of a movement of history which animates ideas, literature, morality, philosophy, and politics at the same time as relationships of production. How could it limit its investigation to one sector of reality? How could it help being pluralistic? How could it help finding the same truth everywhere? There is nothing in principle which prevents us from having ac</page><page sequence="123">108 MAX WEBER cess to history through several entrances: they all lead to the same road junction.11 Merleau-PontyTs eloquence seems for a while to cloud the difficult question of the continuing causal model of historical Marxism, the unresolved problem of the substructure and superstructure, and the material relations of life as a priority element or "factor." And in fact Merleau-Ponty is quick to retrace his steps: A philosophical, rigorous, and coherent Marxism admits the plurality of causes in history, deciphers the same dialectic in all of them, and integrates "personal conceptions" instead of excluding them. But to the extent it does so, it is trans formed into another philosophy which is quite different than vulgar Marxism, and which Marx undoubtedly would not have wished to recognize as his own. What an odd, unobserved metamorphosis! How could that be? Undoubtedly, language, the instruments of enquiry, the whole of Marx's methodological system are those of his time. They can be criticized as excessively "simplifying" of historical human expe rience, "unilateral" as regards the plurality of "causes" (which today we know also to be effects), and "prophetic" rather than sci entific as regards the area of generalization of historical-evolu tionary hypotheses. However, the global, "synoptic" nature of Marxism remains, and it is this attitude toward sociological analy sis that still counts. It is an approach that those sociologists who do not wish to be restricted to the formal working-out of a new scholasticism, mis taking model building for theory and confusing analytical schemes with historical reality, will never be able to do without. In fact, one knows that precision in the measurement of social facts (be havior and institutions) has its price, imposes drastically reductive procedures as regards the variables involved, and puts the deci sion of a political leader on the same plane as that of an individual buying his particular brand of cigarette. Concrete human experi ence emerges impoverished from this. The multidimensional, objective richness of the world of material interests, historically determined, tends to be fragmented, mutilated, and "dominated" in the name of some feature believed indeed to be "dominant." At the same time, historical reality is armored, deformed, and crumbled in a series of fragmentary enquiries, in which both tech nical perfection and the lack of connection with human ends are equally astounding. In other words, reductionism ends up by wel coming naturalism, by inclining, as a tradition, to give up concrete,</page><page sequence="124">POSTSCRIPT 109 specific understanding of human experience, which can only be his torical experience, in favor of a need for systematic standardiza tion fated to turn indefinitely around itself. The Marxist attempt to provide a dynamic, integrated vision of "civil society" as a global whole of interacting variables, or as a developing totality of reciprocal, interdependent conditioning, is highly instructive even today. In the face of the state of extreme fragmentation in contemporary sociological research, it should be constantly recalled. This reminder implies, above all for Italian culture, a task particularly difficult in itself. Here, in fact, per haps more than elsewhere, MarxTs plan has been viewed and ex pounded in historicist-dialectical terms and according to a ba sically idealist perspective, which damages its sociologico-experi mental composition. In my view, it is not so important in Italian culture to establish Tthow theoretical Marxism was born and died" as to make clear the fact that Marxism remained for so long "the oretical" in the speculative sense. That is, it remained a doctrine, instead of being proposed and realized ? correctly, in my view ? not as a doctrine of the traditional kind (omni-comprehensive, metaphysical, ideological-personal), but rather as an abstract syn thesis of concrete ways of being, as circumscribed empirical re search, in which its own method is realized. In Italy, after being a philosophy for professors, or a "concep tology" without empirical controls, Marxism became a "popular philosophy," a mass political force contradicting Croce's assess ment giving socialism up for dead on the basis of a theoretical ac count of the "death of Marxism" after 1912. However, it directly related itself to the natioanl-Neapolitan tradition of idealist his toricism, and thus paid a heavy tribute to CroceTs ferula. Labriola had a nice saying that "ideas don't fall from the clouds." It is a fact that research "on the ground" was lacking, that the great de mystifying impetus of Marxism remained a kind of "prologue in heaven," that there was something of an inclination to counterpose myth to myth, and that when there were empirical studies, these were largely set aside at the outset ? dogmatically instrument - alized. The hurry to "totalize" has led to empty, wholly verbal totalizations ? in other words, to abstract, mystified syntheses. From being an instrument and criterion for directing the living study of historically mature problems, Marxism has become the pretext for exegetic exercises, the occasion for a flight from real ity, masked by philological passion and the talmudic, conceptu ological love of glossing for its own sake. Once more there is a</page><page sequence="125">110 MAX WEBER claim to "thinking history" before knowing it in its empirical, cir cumscribed form. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that the revolutionary process itself should suffer grave, unavoidable involutions of a bureaucratic, "commissar" kind. The Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman said to me some years ago in Warsaw that Stalinism had not yet found its Newton. Possibly. However, since then it has been clear that a monstrous degeneration has taken place, and that the dictatorship of the proletariat has been transformed into dic tatorship over the proletariat. In other words, the technical instru ments of social transformation of Soviet reality have inverted the order of priorities: from being a means of rational articulation be tween desired objectives and available resources they have been presented as an end, even as an end in themselves, taking on the paradoxical nature of a basic irrationality covered up by highly ra tional procedures, which in reality masked an unlimited despotic power. From this precise point of view, what Spinella said about the "struggle against bureaucracy as a system, bureaucratic rational ity, and the processes of bureaucratization which to a growing ex tent involve modern, complex societies," seems to me exception ally interesting. Here we are very far from simplistic, dichoto mous and essentially reactionary visions of a modern world cut neatly into two squares of black and white, East and West, capital ism and socialism. We are brought summarily face to face with a tendency that confronts both East and West, though in different ways from the institutional point of view and that of intellectual orienta tion. This also rudely reveals the sophistic and purely formal na ture of similar manichaean contrasts. The theme is important and should not be allowed to slip out by the convenient sidedoor of a discussion abstractly conceived of as a moralistic recipe good for all contingencies, or as cover for a void of ideas and an irrational - ist, brotherly need for an embrassons -nous. Lack of distinction in theory is only the premise for gratuitous spreading of confusion. It seems to me today ever more urgent to restore the clarifica tion of positions in their specific terms, together with the intellec tual and moral courage to recognize as such the problems that are truly common, problems that concern the very possibility of the survival of humanity. Mario Spinella returned to this subject12 to adjust, from the Marxist side, the aim as regards sociological research; this seems to me to be important. He says he does not feel like contradicting</page><page sequence="126">POSTSCRIPT 111 me when I reproach "contemporary Marxism for the deficiency of its research 'on the ground/ and the too-long-maintained tendency to replace it by convenient definitions of an idealistic nature." After this frank acknowledgment, Spinella passes to the kernel of his argument, trying to demonstrate that "to oppose bureaucratiza tion in capitalist countries, there is no other possibility, in the last analysis, but class struggle, that is, the struggle to reduce and remove the very framework of the process of bureaucratization. In the socialist countries, on the other hand, it is development it self, the internal dynamics of the system, which tends to produce this result." I shall make two observations: 1) It is indeed the emphasis on the systematic, macrosociological aspect that leads Marxism and the analysis traditionally related to it to leave the whole problem in obscurity. Today this problem is clearly seen to be of basic importance, a problem of motivations and incentives to action at the level of individuals and primary groups. That means that global analysis at the systemic level falls back into a position of naturalistic stagnancy, even of mechanical automatism. 2) There is a tendency to absorb and to reduce the permanent critical func tion of the intellectual into the project of class struggle ? the pro duction and organization of dissent. This naturally involves an un comfortable function. However, we know historically that without such a function, society runs the risk of a "commissar-type" in volution and bureaucratic hypertrophy through the withering of the intellectual function ? by way of, and because of, the blocking of the production and circulation of ideas not predicted by organi zational schemes or the letter of the rules. Here, perhaps, the tension between the technician-scientist and the humanist intellectual becomes clear. It is in this perspective that the discussion about the "two cultures" may hope to achieve something more than a debate over terminology or the expression of academic vanity. Marxist analysis tends to collapse one into the other. When Gramsci argues that even the lowest-skilled technical labor could form the basis for the education of the new type of in tellectual, he provides us with the essential elements for the new conception of the intellectual as service intellectual, active if not an activist, distrustful of nonmotivated "gratuitous" thought not connected in some way to the "cause." Yet the technician-scientist and the intellectual, whom for convenience we shall call humanist, cannot be equated without doing violence to things as they are and to the profound needs of social development.</page><page sequence="127">112 MAX WEBER It is clear that culture is singular and that what is needed today is a culture that we can very elliptically describe as "integrated," but that this concerns, as always, a concept-boundary, an ideal, desirable situation, at all events not to be smuggled in, as a posi tion already secured so cheaply as to turn out as a perfect equa tion. In fact, the technician-scientist is first of all an expert, a specialist. The worth and legitimacy of his contribution is founded on a specialization. He has his Fach, instrumental like the adi aphora. In that sense, he is already in the agora, already tied to the scheme of organization and its logic, nor does he dream of putting the type of society to which he belongs into crisis. Essen tially I do not share his attitude, but I cannot do less than recall a passage in Nietzsche which, after all the nonsense about the "two cultures," has at least the merit of originality. He writes, in Thoughts Out of Season,13 that the scientist has qualities much to be appreciated: above all, honesty and a sense of simplicity, if this is to be more than waffle, and an inability to simulate which requires a little wit_ On the other hand, this honesty is mostly of little value, and for science too is seldom fertile because it concerns commonplace things and usually tells the truth only as regards simple things or inadiaphoris, since in this respect it suits idleness better to tell the truth than to keep quiet about it.... In the second place, there is an acute grasp of immediate things, linked with an enormous myopia as regards what is distant and general.... If the scientist wishes to pass from one point which has already been explored to another, he concentrates all his in vestigating powers on the latter. He breaks down an image into many pieces, like someone who uses opera glasses to view the stage and sees now a head, now a piece of costume, but never a complete whole.. .hence he never has a strong sense of everything in general (the scientist is also believed to be daring, but in fact he is not ? he is just like the mule who does not suffer from gid diness). Nietzsche's prejudices are out in the open; in comparison with those of C. P. Snow, the author of the short work The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution, they have at least the positive quality of genius. They bring us back, polemically, to a basic truth: the instrumentality of the scientist's research does not mean that he, as an individual, has no ear for ethical questions. He may also suffer from these to the point of internal torment and neurosis ? the Oppenheimer case was sufficient to demonstrate this. More simply, it means that he deals with an object incapable of meaning</page><page sequence="128">POSTSCRIPT IIS ful reactions. The technical perfection of his work does not place him, directly and initially, face to face with the problem of the aims of the society in which he lives. The case of the intellectual is dif ferent. Here, the ethical option does not arise in the face of re sults already obtained, and does not concern only the good or bad use of a discovery. It is present from the beginning, determining the instruments used; it continuously questions the very bases of the regime and reserves a doubt, a permanent skeptical demand and a critical questioning as regards the basic legitimacy of any kind of coexistence. In this sense, it is the antidogma, the grain of sand able to interrupt the logic of the system, even if this means coming away crushed by it. It is unnecessary to say that the question, far from being obvious, is presented as complex and tortuous, a real experimentum crucis of the social sciences. For a recent profession of scientistic faith, it is enough to read Joseph LopreatoTs review of this very book.14 This empirical sociologist's lack of understanding when faced with Weber resembles, paradoxically ? or perhaps we should say sym metrically ? that of Carlo Antoni. They attacked Weber because he did not give us an accurate philology of the Protestant theologi cal texts. Lopreato reproaches him, after Kurt Samuelsson's critique,15 for having used Offenbach's defective statistics. It is like saying that D?rkheim's Suicide and concept of anomie have no value and are totally discounted because Morrato's statistical se ries and the registers on which D?rkheim worked now seem to us to be unreliable. A more important point escapes the American crit ic: the methodological design of Weber, in which finally the two major groups into which sociological studies are traditionally divided ? the "structural," systematic, macrosociological, and the "relational," sociopsychological, microsociological ? meet or problematically try to link up. After Weber, despite all the uncer tainties from which it would be too easy to escape, as did Lopreato, arguing that these concern only metaphysical fears ? German, even ? one can no longer propose research under the rubric substruc ture versus superstructure, culture versus personality, or institu tion versus behavior. I understand Lopreato's concern: he wants to ensure, by way of the divorce between "fact" and "value" (though facts do not speak of their own accord.'), the "scientific" nature of sociology. He wants it to be clean, neutral ? castrated, even ? just as long as it is scientific. For this reason, he sets up the dis tinction or "fence" between sociology and "social criticism." There is no argument if this is intended to emphasize the distinc</page><page sequence="129">114 MAX WEBER tion between the analytical and the therapeutic-committed moment, though only with the basic reservation that the very exposition of empirical data always implies, for the contemporary observer, a movement from the positionof distanced observer to that of partici pant analyst. However, there is complete, total disagreement if by this formula there is a tendency to counterpose sociology as "pure science" to so-called "social criticism." I gladly leave it to the psychologists and sociologists of science to discover what is hidden by the myth of "pure science"; that is, if it involves only a fear of manual (labor) contamination, deter mined by the need to have the recognition of a certain "social re spectability," or if, on the other hand, it represents an indispen sable means of defense and protection against the pressures of other social, professional groups ? the equivalent of hieroglyphs for the priests of ancient Egypt. I am anxious only to clarify the danger that such a deficient understanding of sociology, theoreti cally speaking, may bring about the viewing of the field of sociolog ical studies as a smooth, harmonious reality in which theory and research complement each other beautifully, and empirical data and the analysis of the theoretical social system go along together, and everything disappears into a monodic, unmemorable idyllic atmosphere. Things are different. In my judgment, every sociological investi gation that questions reality concretely, not gratuitously, is proper ly an act of social criticism, and cannot avoid so being unless it falls into pure, and thus interchangeable, technique. In other words, the decision as to whether sociology is critical analysis, or is made into a new technique of conformism at the expense of the highest bidder, is tested in real ? determinate and circum scribed ? problems of the historical situation in which, in the broad sense, they are developed. This means that in the United States, where there are seven thousand sociologists, not one has anything new to say about the risings of blacks in Los Angeles, Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago, that none has predicted these up risings and real insurrections, and that their "scientific" explana tions are not too far from the police ones. All this tells me much more about the state of sociology in that country than all Talcott Parson's or Paul F. Lazarsfeld's books put together. I know that when expressed in these terms, the discussion of so ciology goes beyond the confines of the purely theoretical and involves questions of substance. Mino Vianello seems convinced of this when he says 16 that my argument "can take us very far." Indeed,</page><page sequence="130">POSTSCRIPT 115 if the central theme in Weber is that of the rationality of industrial society ? and of this there is no doubt ? and if, then, Weber's concern for organization theory should be viewed in this light, as many have observed, one basically has to have recourse to a conception of history. Ferrarotti sees this clearly ? so much so that he turns his attention to the faith in progress that underlaid the last cen tury's sociology, in order to stress the difference in the starting points of the most sensitive sociologists of this century, from Weber to Michels, and from Mannheim to Marcuse. It is the dilemma of the intellectual in industrial so ciety. ... Weber linked the question to the point of view of the individual; but whence can these subjective points of view draw their justification? The question raised by Vianello repeats that posed to me by Wolff, and which in any case I myself raised for Weber, if only in a foot note, though it probably seemed superfluous to him, both because of his certainty about the values of the liberal tradition and because of his intermittent attachment to the world of Values with a capital "V," typical of Rickert. In Weber's works there are methodological passages that rather take the edge off the defense of Weber from the charge of "du alism" and "metaphysics of values." For example: In the empirical social sciences, as we have seen, the possibility of meaningful knowledge of what is essential for us in the infinite richness of events is bound up with the unremitting application of viewpoints of a specifically particularized character, which, in the last analysis, are oriented on the basis of evaluative ideas. These evaluative ideas are for their part empirically discoverable and analyzable as elements of meaningful human conduct, but their validity cannot be deduced from empirical data as such. The "objectivity" of the social sci ences depends rather on the fact that the empirical data are always related to those evaluative ideas which alone make them worth knowing and the signifi cance of the empirical data is derived from these evaluative ideas. But these data can never become the foundation for the empirically impossible proof of the validity of the evaluative ideas. The belief which we all have in some form or other, in the m eta-empirical validity of ultimate and final values, in which the meaning of our existence is rooted, is not incompatible with the incessant changefulness of the concrete viewpoints, from which empirical reality gets its significance.... The light which emanates from those highest evaluative ideas always falls on an ever changing finite segment of the vast chaotic stream of events, which flows away through time.17 Here, the influence of Rickert would seem to be overwhelming, but one must resist the "slashing" temptation to capitalize on such cracks, so as not to be aware of Weber's deep involvement; at the same time it is important not to take the direction of hagiography. In this context, I find very well-founded the observations in the reviews by Gottfried Eisermann,18 Franco Crespi,19 Armando</page><page sequence="131">116 MAX WEBER Catemario,20 and, with special reference to WeberTs famous argu ment on the genesis of capital, Carlo Tasca.21 But it is in Aldo ZanardoTs remarks that I find once more the thread of my basic argument. Zanardo starts from a radical critique of my formula of "alienation by technology," and brings out in it a supposed decadent, existentialist foundation, finishing up with a generous act of faith in the future of humanity. I share the act of faith, but the linear character of ZanardoTs reasoning seems less convincing. I feel like saying "too good to be true." In short ened form, here are the lines of the argument: To talk of indus trial society does not mean, today, to talk of human society. How ever, the dishumanity of industrial society does not involve its structures, rhythms, and ways of development ? in a word, its logic. It concerns, rather, its contemporary, transient, forms, its historical formulation; these are not to be hypothesized as the only possible ones. Hence, it is not industrialization as such, but rather an insufficiently extreme form of industrialization, an incomplete one, that may be the source of new forms of alienation. I do not believe in the thesis whereby inhumanity ? the "floating in a void," "doing for its own sake," "mass apathy," and "lack of personal participation" that distinguish modern society ? basically derives from industrialization and the modernity of the productive apparatus. Certainly, it is legitimate to leave aside relations of production; and, if many forms of alienation are derived from anachronistic relations of production, others are certainly rooted in a deeper sphere ? in industrial reality itself. Nevertheless, I cannot understand exactly what is meant when it is argued that this industrial reality is industri alization tout court, the peak development of the productive forces, rather than a particular form of development of these forces, a particular industrialization, confined to certain countries with particular productive capacities.... In other words, I cannot envisage an alienation tied to industrial production itself, one that cannot be removed thanks to the increase in production and greater pro ductivity by human labor. The sociologist who in his abstract analysis cuts the link that joins his correct analysis to historical totality, in my opinion finds himself exposed to the danger of mistaking for the particular contradictions of modernity or of the affluent society precisely those of nonmodernity or of per sisting poverty; and for problems typical of a mythical homo industrialis those typical of an aristocracy or of a historical (American) society, defined and situated in a determinate world.22 ZanardoTs position is peculiarly close to MarcuseTs conclusions. As the latter says in One-dimensional Man, the technological pro cesses of mechanization and standardization could liberate individ ual energies in a realm of freedom beyond necessity unexplored until now. Though this seems scarcely credible, we are still deal</page><page sequence="132">POSTSCRIPT 117 ing with the (to me, fatally illusory) idea that there is a homeo pathic cure for industrialization, given, of course, that it be taken in increasingly larger doses. This involves serious efforts; but they are viewing the problem from the outside. The same misun derstanding colors current observations on Mfree time," as though a man who is a slave for most of his days could regain his real humanity at the factory gates or the office door, by changing his shirt. The "human recovery" referred to will not be given us by technique, or by full industrialization. It is only possible by inter rupting the technical process from within, at the very moment it occurs, by humanizing its rhythms and repersonalizing its logic, even if this means a loss of productivity. Zanardo and Marcuse, on the other hand, seem to me to be stuck in the old argument about the use of technique ? which can be good or bad according to the macrosocial ends it serves, independently of its effective functioning. Marx had already intuited the sophistic nature of this argument. For Marcuse, it is transformed into a dythrambic hymn to automation, optical illusions of the mystified dialectic. What is inevitably the result of a political decision is, in the last instance, made to appear derived from technical super concentration. The instrument that can perfect the repressive, deeply tyrannical nature of technically advanced societies, and can indeed, through the rapid elaboration of information and its sys tematic centralization, supersede the "delegation of authority" (which in large-scale productive and distributive apparatuses has been, at least for practical purposes, regarded as necessary), is transformed by Marcuse into the catalyst of the liberation of hu manity. It would allow human beings to conquer the "aesthetic di mension." It is in this dimension that Marcuse sees the two Freudian principles of reality and pleasure finally reconciled. The individual once more contains in himself the "higher" and "lower" human faculties. He is once more an "integral" being; no more, as in Plato's phrase in the Symposium, like someone dancing on one leg on a wine skin. However, I do not see how such human "integration" can, sic et simpliciter, flow out like a gift, from technique ? which has always served precisely to produce things in the mass and to limit human experiences, thus making them "functional" and "practical." Timeo Danaos ... I must also make a profession of faith: I believe in the future of humanity and I am ready to pay the price of that belief. In fact, I know that faith in happiness is seen as vulgar. However, I do fear the gifts of tech nical progress. I don't know how to imagine them as free and painless.</page><page sequence="133">118 MAX WEBER Marcuse correctly sees in technique a system of dominance at the structural level. One would need to go deeper and discover what the flow of production, the "roundabout" of advanced forms of the production line, the calculating devices in offices, repetition and boredom, mean for the blue-collar and the white-collar work er. What does it mean to have one's own gestures and movements mortgaged to the time-and-motion-study department for the next twenty or thirty years ? for a lifetime? Technical progress and technology in general are organized so as to guarantee the coercive cohesiveness of the existing system ? from the movement of the apprentice, and from the early morning clock punching. Now Mar cuse believes, states, that technique can be adapted for a different use, on a different organizational basis, and that socialism should wait for that. But there is only one technique, one scientific orga nization of labor. Taylorism and Stakhanovism are equal to one another as regards procedures and even immediate psychological reflexes. What changes is the destination of the surplus value produced. The rhythms, the methods, the human factor, in other words, the relation of domination-submission, or the system of domination implicit in the spurious collaboration that permits the technical apparatus to function ? these do not change. What emerges as the decisive element (which I have tried to explain for years) is not the juridical system, but the planned mechanism, the modes of effective, specific, daily control, beyond the various juridical fictions, whereby my life is controlled, "lived" by others. It is in other hands than my own, it doesn't depend on me and per haps not even on others as others ? that is, as persons ? but on the whole mechanism, the reality-screen, whoever controls and pulls on the reins of power and sits far away, unknown, unas sailable, immovable, and serene. Deus absconditusl Marcuse is thus faced with an alternative he cannot resolve: either to preserve nothing from repressive society and be regarded as a Luddite, sentimental and rather archaic, or to accept the in struments that make the world what it is by preventing its trans formation. He cannot explain how the world of technique, which is clearly not all contained in "industrial design," can be reconciled with the "aesthetic dimension." Need one refer to Freud to be con vinced of the impossibility of that reconciliation? Finally, Marcuse repeats his hopes for automation. It seems to him destined to free the individual from needs, from alienated la bor, and hence from aggressiveness. And from reason too? In fact, the world of automation will easily do without reason: art</page><page sequence="134">POSTSCRIPT 119 becomes life, and thought is transformed into action. Once the ends proposed by imagination and fantasy have been attained, once the new age of Saturn has been achieved, and when the problem of the survival and preservation of the human species by means of ra tional calculation has diminished, reason is smitten by obsoles cence and is on the way to technological unemployment. But Mar cuse hesitates in the face of a potential distancing of reason from the "aesthetic state." It seems that in the new saturnia aetas, in stead of feeding ourselves by hunting and fishing we shall be able to stretch out in the sun with canned meat within reach. Recently, Marcuse has returned to the problem of the transition from technico-formal rationality to substantial rationality, and in this regard he has tried to redefine the concept of social revolution as a historic moment and the instrument of the major transforma tion of society as global system. Yet here too there emerges from his arguments a basis that is still romantic and basically static. In fact, MarcuseTs vision of one-dimensional society can be per suasively presented and interpreted as the result of an unconscious convergence with the integrationist theses of Parsonian structural - functionalism. The latter does indeed postulate a society wholly concentrated around certain consensual values, deeply internalized by way of different techniques in individuals and groups, to the point of obliterating the capacity to reject, which exists alongside that of adapting, and thus of not being able credibly to explain social change. There is here something very suggestive, if not surpris ing, in the criticism against the best-known representative of a strictly Hegelian reading of Marx, for a lack of dialectic. However, the charge does not seem to be easily shrugged off. Further, can a totally alienated bureaucratic apparatus be efficient? Can it be efficient to the point of producing, preserving, and self-perpetuating an integrated society, by definition without an opposition? Where will change come from? Or perhaps there is no longer any need even to think about it, in the mood of total, apocalyptic pessimism, which did indeed, until very recently, mark MarcuseTs attitude? Marcusers reply to these questions does not contain new ele ments. He has once more evoked protest and confrontation move ments now occurring in the world, consisting of marginal groups (third world, blacks, hippies, students, etc.), disparate certainly as regards their social position and motives, but all converging on the "global rejection," the total negation of the system. In fact, from the point of view of Marxism itself, the answer seems par ticularly weak ? for two reasons. First, Marx does not by chance</page><page sequence="135">120 MAX WEBER select the working class as the general revolutionary class; he chooses it because it stands in a direct relation to the means of production. Now, what is the position of the marginal groups evoked by Marcuse in relation to the means of production ? in re lation to the functional needs of the productive structure, the mo tive power, for Marx, of every society? Second, certainly negation is creative insofar as it does not dilute the contradiction between relations of production and social form, and it pushes the latter toward the liberating explosion; but in Marxist terms, total rejec tion means putting oneself outside history. Negation is creative on the condition that it present itself as a determinate negation and a specific abstraction. Only on the basis of these general methodological assumptions is it possible to understand how useless it is to pose the problem of human consciousness, and the possibility of transforming it, in the abstract. Rather than asking the generic unanswerable question tTWhat is man?" one must establish the essential features of the system and the dominant characteristics of which man, historically dated and living, is a derivative function. In this perspective, it is also possible to see that the problem of the individual is not a sin gular fact. Explicitly beginning with my interpretation of Weber, Carlo Tullio Altan has put before students of the social sciences a number of intelligent observations.23 They concern the problem of other ness, and what he calls "the universals of the human condition." From these he derives the concept of "situation," seen as a para meter for testing the functionality of a structure or system. Through this, both on the semantic and the historical and experi mental levels, he arrives at an identification of functionality and functioning. With that one certainly cannot say that he has resolved the problem of TTWhat is to be done?"; but we have undoubtedly reached a critical level of discussion in which it is no longer ad missible to smuggle in purely tautological propositions. The truth is that faced with the problem of trWhat is to be done?" we have no exhaustive answers and we cannot trust hurried, doctrinaire for mulas. When the all-inclusive nineteenth -century Weltanschauungen have collapsed, it is pointless to try to replace them with swift, superb tours de force by a dialectical intelligence that lacks the instruments for bringing out the empirical data and the everyday quality of human experience, without thus being overcome, and digested, by it. The connection between the macrosociological level of analysis and microsociological, empirical elaboration is not the</page><page sequence="136">POSTSCRIPT 121 only basic methodological problem of sociology today. It involves, also, a group of operative possibilities, which, logically, may tend toward the total liberation of man by way of projects directed through social initiative, which can involve him at the level of his immediate experience and connect him with his neighbor ? to other men ? with the tension of middle-range Utopias in which news and history merge and the impulse to a new relational dialectic is born. I know very well that this is not a short-term perspective, one that consoles. I do not, however, count "consolation at all costs" among the many duties of sociology.

Concerning the Rickert-Weber connection, especially in a light</page><page sequence="139">124 NOTES unfavorable to Rickert, Jaspers gives important evidence (in Philosophische Autobiographie, pp. 59-63). Rossi (Lo storicismo, p. 437) is likewise to some extent inclined toward a philosophizing interpretation. Nevertheless, he must be credited with presenting Weber to Italy as a sociologist in a precise sense; see his "La so ciologia di Max Weber," Quaderni di Sociologia, 1954, nn. 12-13. Alexander von Schelting suggests (in Die logische Theorie der historischen Wissenschaften von Max Weber und im besonderen sein Begriff des Idealtypus, Tubingen, 1922) that there was a theo retical development of the notions of "possibility" and "reality" in Weber, by way of a comparison with Kant. Antoni argues (Dallo storicismo, p. 179) that tTWeber never managed to free himself completely from these philosophical-psychological pretensions." Antoni also proposes a fierce confrontation between "ideal type" and "Platonic idea," which is seriously misleading, insofar as it runs the risk of immediately identifying a methodological argu ment about concrete sociological investigations with an absolute, metaphysical kind of argument.

BaumgartenTs introduction to Max Weber, Soziologie, Weltgeschichtliche Analysen, Politik, Stutt gart, 1956, p. xi. 21. Aron tends to view Weber in the perspective of the philosophy of history (German Sociology, p. 67 ff.), while F. Lombardi, with occasional uncertainties, sees him primarily as a sociologist (see especially F. Lombardi, II piano del nostro sapere, Turin, 1958, pp. 107 and 112-16). 22. See in this regard the penetrating comments of A. Cavalli, TtWeber e Sombart e la disputa sui giudizi di valore," in Quaderni di Sociologia; vol. xiii (January-March 1964), especially pp. 35 ff., where, however, Rickert's influence on Weber and his methodology is seen as basic. 23.

Leo Strauss is ironical about what he wittily calls the re duct io ad Hitlerum: "A view is not refuted by the fact that it hap pens to have been shared by Hitler" (Strauss, Natural Right, p. 42). However, he also argues that 'Weber's thesis necessarily leads to nihilism or to the view that every preference, however evil, base, or insane, has to be judged before the tribunal reason to be as legitimate as any other preference" (Natural Right, p. 42-43). 2. See T. Parsons, The Structure of Social Action, New York, Free Press, 1949. 3. Weber speaks of "value freedom" for the first time in the essay "Der Sinn der 'Wertfreiheit' der soziologischen and ?konom ischen Wissenschaften" (1917) (collected in Methodology of the So cial Sciences), but he had already used the adjective "value-free" (Wertfrei) in Roscher and Knies. 4. The neonatural-law position of Strauss has generally met with</page><page sequence="141">126 NOTES severe criticisms in Italy. See among others, N. Bobbio: "Unclear in design, somewhat confused and rhapsodic in its exposition,... it unleashes a fierce attack against historicism and the ethical doc trine that separates values from facts (which he sees typified in Max Weber), in order to propose a return to classical natural law, outside which there is supposed to be nothing but a running toward the precipice of fanatical obscurantism, nihilism" (Rivista di filo sofia, 1954, p. 429). See also G. Fasso: "To mistake historicism for an ingenuous ethical, empirical relativism either signifies ig norance of the terms of the problem or alternatively is a miser able, polemical, dirty trick which one refuses to believe could have been employed by a scholar such as Strauss" (II Mulino, 1958, p. 239). 5. See Weber, Methodology of the Social Sciences, p. 86, ff. 6. For references to this school see Gesammelte Aufs?tze zur Wissenschaftslehre, T?bingen, 1951, pp. 2, 171, 187, 208, 217, and 385; on the school of "classical political economy" see pp. 7, 8, 30, 31, 32, 39, 41, 104, 115, 118 ff., 130, 131, 188-89, 375 note 87, and 412. 7. The founder of the first school was G. Roscher, and his fol lowers were B. Hildebrand and C. Knies; it must be distinguished from the "Young Historical School" founded by the historian Schmoller around 1870. The key figure of the "classical" school is K. Menger. 8.

Ibid., p. 110. 21. See Weber, Protestant Ethic. 22. In 1921, Honigsheim, who had known Weber well, remarked: "nothing Max Weber had said, done or written was so discussed, commented upon, poorly interpreted, and derided, as his doctrine of value freedom in the science of sociology" (P. Honigsheim, "Max Weber als Soziolog," K?lner Vierteljahreshefte f?r Sozial - Wissenschaften, vol. 1, no. 1, 1921, p. 35). 23. The basic problem is unresolved: What is the basis, the source, the "presupposition" of commitment itself. However, as we shall see later, Weber is not interested in this, as these value assumptions or "universal imperatives" he takes for granted. 24. Weber, Methodology of the Social Sciences, p. 104 ff. 25. In this respect the frequent evaluations that "escape" Weber during his analysis are revealing, and have been collected and com mented upon, ironically, by Strauss (Natural Right, pp. 54-55).
