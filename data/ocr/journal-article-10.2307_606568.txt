The fact that Pancatantra stories are found in the KSS and the BKM can tell us little, if anything, about the source of Bana's Kadambarl.

Studies in Asian Art and Archaeology, vol. 20. Leiden: BRILL, 1997. Pp. x + 355, plates, $151. Images of Brahmanic (or Hindu) deities begin to be made in India perhaps in the second century B.C. These beginnings persist through a period of several centuries as artistic forms develop and change, leading to the iconography that becomes fairly standardized for Siva, Visnu, and other gods by about the fourth or fifth centuries A.D. Srinivasan's truly magisterial book asks what forms did these earliest images take and why. She is interested in beginnings, a focus art historians often have due to the conundrum of how the first images can appear as if out of nothing, and the understanding that the earliest images are the basis for all later images in the tradition. Just identifying the earliest images can be helpful. The beginnings for Hindu images are marked further by a specific puzzle: "While the earliest phase (of images), religious in nature, is archaic in style, the iconography is not primitive" (p. 185). In other words, the early images reveal a complicated and already advanced iconography, but with styles that are, on the other hand, according to Srinivasan, awkward and appear experimental. Srinivasan thus argues that the images are not coming from a previous image tradition (which would mandate more concretized and developed styles, and for which there is indeed, no extant evidence); yet what then explains the com- plex iconography? Srinivasan's answer is that it is coming from the very long and very extensive Indian textual tradition, one that begins with the Rig Veda, a text some of whose parts were composed as early as 1500 B.C. and thus over a millennium be- fore any images were made. For scholars who work primarily on texts, that the early Hindu images are "based" on the rich plethora of religious texts may seem obvious. Perhaps for art historians as well. But using the texts to understand the images is a methodology taught to us primarily, as so much else, by Ananda Coomaraswamy. Particularly the need to look to the Vedas, or as he wrote in 1935: "these compositions [early Indian sculptures] are com- prehensible only with reference to Vedic notions, and the early Indian art is essentially the continuation of a mainly aniconic 'Vedic' style."' Further, it is Coomaraswamy who told us that it is the "meaning" of the art with which we should be concerned, and that meaning lies in what the texts tell us. This association of text and image was then applied by Stella Kramrisch in her interpretation of the Hindu temple. What comes first is the text, and the image and temple are visual interpretations of the texts, or what Coomaraswamy calls "a visual theology."2 Art is thus a symbol system to be read as a theological statement, and it is this approach that Srinivasan uses. The hook on which she hangs this comprehensive look at the earliest Hindu images is one of their most intriguing icono- graphical features, the multiplication of body parts, usually heads and arms, which she calls "the multiplicity convention." This visual feature of the imagery has a simple explanation, one that begins in the Rig Veda: The Rig Veda envisions the birth of the universe as analo- gous to human birth through labour. In this view, the creator god creates the universe by emitting all forms which lie dormant in the middle.... Being thus pregnant with the forms of the phenomenal world until he is ready to give birth, the creator god is with multiple body parts and/or forms much like a mother is "with child."

It is from this simple seed that the next three hundred tightly packed and argued pages will unfold. It is often said in reviews that an author's work cannot be adequately conveyed in a brief review, and that is certainly true for this study. In what follows I can only indicate the very basic outline of Srinivasan's arguments. The book is divided into two parts, the first dealing with meaning and text, the second with form and iconography. The textual studies trace the develop- ment and change of the notion of cosmic birthing and the deities associated with it-such as Prajapati, Purusa, and Rudra-Siva-through the vedas, brahmanas, upanisads, and the Mahabhdrata. Srinivasan's use of the texts differs in this from their use by Coomaraswamy and Kramrisch, who treated texts as ahistorical and cultural-wide truths, while Srinivasan's in- tent is to show developments and shifts over time and by geo- graphical location. One important change is the emphasis in the upanisads of "the idea of a large Cosmic Person whose body is creation..." (p. 86). Thus, while the Vedic notion of creation being indicated by multiple body parts continues, added to it is that creation can be indicated by the colossal size of the being, a size that indicates fullness. This characteristic will appear in the size of enormous yaksa images. Most concepts essential for understanding why the early images take the forms they do Srinivasan finds in the textual analysis. I will mention only two. One is associated with the Agnicayana ritual. Prajapati, the Pregnant Male, gives birth by emptying out his "extended middle," which leaves him ex- pended. The Agnicayana sacrifice involves building a huge bird- shaped altar which Srinivasan interprets as reimpregnating the god. The sacrifice itself is seen as a form of Prajapati, his pratima, a word often used later to indicate a physical image. In looking for sources for the creation of deities in anthropomor- phic form, Srinivasan suggests that the sacrificial ritual itself can be seen as an "icon" that will be translated into an image. She takes this theme up again in the second part, where she focuses on the objects (chapter fourteen); it is an argument she has made before, but I find it very suggestive, and the one attempt to find a connection between the ritual of the Vedic religion with the images of Hinduism. As she will say later in the book: "Ritual in ancient India may have been the experi- ential connection between ideas we now consign to texts and iconography we now confirm in imagery" (p. 196). A second essential concept read in texts that will be made concrete in both Saiva and Vaisnava iconography is that of the god manifesting himself through a three-part unfolding, going from a numinous and unmanifest form to a concrete and defined form and from a heavenly realm to an earthly one-these two aspects linked by a third, in-between form. The numinous form of the god is fearsome, and thus the human worshiper yearns for an earthly and approachable form, an anthropomorphic form that raises its hand indicating to the devotee to "fear not." In the Saivite context, for example, there is in the texts the yoni (formless body), the linga (subtle body), and munrti or tanf (earthly body), which will concretize into three aspects of Siva beginning with the all-linga or subtle form, to the five-faced Sadasiva (this includes the single mukha lingas), and then to the fully manifest body of god, Mahesa (pp. 110, 118, 121, 256, 272). In all this discussion of texts and doctrine Srinivasan is attempting to construct a "bridge from words to forms" (the title of her chapter eleven), or to make a "transition from ideo- logy to iconography" (p. 137). In part two, she takes up the detailed study of the sculptures, that is, their forms and icono- graphy. She is building this part on a long list of her previous studies, which is very helpful to the reader who desires further discussion of the often complex arguments. She starts by re- moving Siva's beginnings from association with Indus Valley culture and art, and along with them any links to the multiplicity convention. Srinivasan's arguments rejecting an Indus "proto- Siva" seal image have, I think, been widely accepted by schol- ars. She places the Hindu god Siva's roots squarely in Vedic sources, with the Vaisnava pantheon being (not Indus) but more outside the Vedic fold, a turn-around from the accepted wisdom of just a few decades ago. A second significant shift in image interpretation is that of the yaksa (chapter fifteen). When Coomaraswamy published his two-part study of Yaksas in 1928-31,3 he called them tutelary deities, patron saints, guardian angels, Lords of Life- beings associated with specific locales and water, guardians of life, and so forth. Srinivasan's Yaksas are, on the other hand, "cosmic entities empowered with animating energy" (p. 209). They come from the notion of the Pregnant Male, like Purusa- Prajapati, and that of the upanisadic large size and swollen middle, indicating paturition. When they begin to be made as iconic images in stone in around the second century B.C., they are often huge, massive males with enormous girth (mahiyaksa). They do not have multiple arms or heads, expressing their cos- mic animation through their size alone. There are, of course, other types and sizes of Yaksas. Srinivasan shows some that are in the form of round clay pots, with the association to the purnaghata or full womb-chamber, while others are carved in relief with vines and foliage issuing from their mouths or navels. Perhaps her interpretation of the yaksa is not all that different from that of Coomaraswamy, but should be consid- ered in a hierarchy of importance rather than one of intention. There are several chapters dealing with the very complicated unraveling of the early Saiva and Vaisnava images, many issues of which have been brought up in part one and also discussed by Srinivasan in previous articles. The overlapping of discus- 3 Ananda K.

Coming into play are not only the textual imagery, but also, particularly for the Vaisnava images, non-textual in- fluences-for example, that of the cult of heroes (vrsnivira), located primarily at Mathura (the topic of chapter sixteen), the four successive emanations of Niaryana (caturvyFha), and the avatara (chapter eighteen). The last of the important early deity types is the goddess who kills the Buffalo Demon (chapter twenty). Srinivasan calls her an enigma, for she is the only Hindu deity that does not have any reference or explanation in the textual tradition Srinivasan has so painstakingly analyzed. Who she is for this early time is simply not known (although she will be later called Mahisasuramardini), and so Srinivasan prefers to call her the "Warrior Goddess." Her connections are to the art of northwest India, although this in some ways only deepens the enigma. What it does tell us is that some iconic images arose at this early time completely outside of the textual tradition. There is more. I have not said anything about Srinivasan's discussion of the numerological significance of multiple arms and heads. I have not said anything about her theories of why Mathura was the location for much of this early image making. I have not said anything about her interesting comments about the Buddhist and Jain images being made at the same time which did not use the multiplicity convention. I will end by pointing out areas of her study that will pro- bably produce contention and debate. One is the dating of some of the images. Srinivasan has illustrated or referenced most of the early Hindu images, which is very helpful. But the period covered is some five centuries, and the exact dating of some of the images seems to me debatable. For example, the Siva image form RsikeSa (pl. 17.10) which she dates to the Sufiga period appears to me to be much later, probably the second century A.D. The very important Malhar Vaisnava image, which Srini- vasan says is dated by inscription to the first century B.C., is based on paleographical interpretation, not a date. It may be from the first century B.C., but has been recut and could support further discussion. Of course, the precise date for this early material is very difficult to suggest, and may not be that impor- tant for most of her arguments. Still, the textual evidence can- not help us, if at all, in dating the images; this can only be done by stylistic evidence. A second area of contention will certainly be her interpre- tation of the texts. The texts she discusses are not attempting to describe images. They have to be interpreted, and Srinivasan spends a great deal of time proposing and reconstructing their intent and implications for imagery. She is one of the very few art historians who has the linguistic skills and knowledge to undertake such detailed and technical analyses of these texts. And she differs from Coomaraswamy and Kramrisch in this as she is undertaking a hermeneutical study, while they felt texts spoke for themselves. Certainly, other scholars may read these texts differently from Srinivasan, but this discussion will only help to further our understanding. And finally, the very idea of the image as a theological state- ment will strike many art historians of India as questionable. Can these images be read as if they are word statements? Sri- nivasan makes an interesting argument in this regard. She says: If I had to distinguish between the main general character- istics marking early and later Hindu images endowed with the multiplicity convention, I would say that the latter relate mainly to lila and the former relate mainly to veda, that is, theological knowledge. Pre-Gupta Hindu images, regardless of sect, betray a great desire to gain knowledge (veda) of the nature of the godhead. Therefore I view these early represen- tations, in the main, as theological statements. (pp. 12-13) This has implications for the nature of narrative art, and, as she points out (p. 238), for differences between Hindu and Buddhist art. The book must be read by everyone who works on the art and religion of early India. Coomaraswamy and Kramrisch (who was one of Srinivasan's teachers) would be proud of her work. ROBERT L.
