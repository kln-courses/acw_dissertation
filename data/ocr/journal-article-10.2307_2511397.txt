<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leopoldo Zea and Mexican Positivism: A Reappraisal WILLIAM D. RAAT* HE NAME which Auguste Comte gave to his system of philosophy was positivism. He chose this name for the simple reason that philosophy for Comte had to be derived from and based on the "positive" sciences: mathematics, as- tronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and social physics. It was a philosophy of science-or rather, a synthesis of the particular "truths" of the individual sciences which were all considered to be manifestations of natural phenomena. Yet, for Comte, it was not enough to study and develop a system of philosophy for its own sake. The positivist philosopher was to ap- ply his knowledge actively to the human condition and all of its prob- lems, for his positivist understanding placed him in the best position to serve the cause of mankind. Thus it was that Comte's whole phi- losophy of science involved political, religious, and ethical consider- ations, as well as the strictly logical and scientific, and he called it collectively the Religion of Humanity.1 Comte's Religion of Humanity was based on both theory and prac- tice. Theoretically it involved a philosophy of government in which positivist elite groups organized and influenced a sociocratic state. In practice it involved worship by orthodox positivists in secular temples, the deification of Comte himself, a priesthood, a group of disciples and followers, a missionary program, the symbol of the Vir- gin, and many other ritualistic traits. Positivism, either modified or orthodox, was the system of thought adopted by hundreds of disciples, missionaries, and believers in many countries of Europe and Latin America. In France, Pierre Laffitte and Emile Littre were the main directors of the movement after * The author is Assistant Professor of History at Moorhead State College. 1 Comte 's philosophy of science was formulated in a six-volume work, Cours de Philosophie Positive (Paris, 1830-1842), and his Religion of Humanity appeared in the four-volume Syste'me de Politique Positive (Paris, 1851-1854). For some of Comte 's writings available in English see The Positive Philosophy (3 vols., London, 1896) and A General View of Positivism (London, 1865).

Positivism also found adherents of one variety or another in the United States, Germany, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, and, of course, Mexico. Excepting Social Darwinism and Marxism, prob- ably no other system of philosophy was as important as positivism for the intellectual history of nineteenth-century Europe and Latin America.2 The writing of intellectual history is a fairly recent development in Mexican historiography. This is especially the case concerning the social role of the ideology of French or Comtean positivism in the context of Mexican history during the Porfiriato. Early accounts contemporary with the era of Porfirio Diaz, 1876-1911, were for the most part polemics either defending or attacking the philosophy it- self, with little or no attempt to relate positivism to a historical con- text.3 Although the writings of one of Mexico's most orthodox posi- tivists, Agustin Aragon,4 were a major exception to this procedure, it was not until the 1940s, through the efforts of Samuel Ramos and Leopoldo Zea,5 that this basic trend was changed. 2 One writer has gone further to suggest that the influence of positivism dom- inated many of the social studies in Latin America throughout the twentieth century, including much contemporary thinking. See Harold E. Davis, "Trends in Social Thought in Twentieth-Century Latin America," Journal of Inter-.Amer- ican Studies, I (January 1959), 58 ff. 3From the listed titles in the bibliography of Emeterio Valverde Tellez it is obvious that most of the early writings relating to positivism were purely philo- sophical, theological, or polemic in content. See Valverde T6llez, Bibliografia filos6fica mexicana (Mexico, 1907). For examples of the polemics of the 1880s see the following: Porfirio Parra, "La l6gica Bain y los profesores sus enemigos," La Libertad, July 16, 1880; Hilario S.

' See especially Arag6n 's Essai sur I'histoire du positivisme au Mexique (M6x- ico and Paris, 1898) and his many articles and editorials which appeared in Mexico's positivist journal, Bevista positiva, I-XIV (Mexico, 1901-1914).

Although Mexican writers have sometimes been critical of Zea, some of the most recent writings on Mexican positivism by Victor Alba and Abelardo Villegas have not only based their own research upon Zea's works, but have also re- tained the Zea scheme intact. English-speaking writers have shown even less inclination than their Mexican counterparts to question Zea's method and conclusions. Such studies as those produced by Harvey Salem, Sam Schulman, and Patrick Romanell have all been based on the secondary authority of Leopoldo Zea.6 To date no general revi- sion or investigation of Zea's account of positivism in Diaz Mexico has appeared, so that the most important and comprehensive history of Mexican positivism remains Zea's classic volumes, El positivismo en Mexico and Apogeo y decadencia del positivismo ent Mexico. Major contentions and justifications of this essay are that Zea 's histories were at least partially inadequate in both methodology and content and therefore demand both reappraisal anad redirection. Samuel Ramos was the first of his generation to write in the area of intellectual history as usually defined. Both his philosophical and his historical writings had a great influence upon Leopoldo Zea's work. Zea borrowed from Ramos both his notion of perspectivism and his general outline of positivism in Mexico as an ideological expression of Mexico's special circumstances. Ramos learned from Ortega y Gasset that ideas were philosophical perspectives relative to any and every Haven, 1949), 166-191. Needless to say, the major schemes outlined by Zea's El positivismo en M6xico and Apogeo y decadencia have remained intact and are repeated in the later works, including the very recent article "El positivismo," in Estudios de histo-ria de la filosofi,a en M6xico (Mexico, 1963), 243-267. The latter citation has recently been translated into English as Major Trends in Mexican Philosophy (Notre Dame, 1966). 6 For examples of Mexican writers see the following: Eli de Gortari, "Ciencia positiva politica 'cientifica,' " Historia mexicana, I (April-June 1952), 603-616; Eli de Gortari, La ciencia en la historia de M6xico (Mexico, 1963), 305-308, 337; Victor Alba, Las ideas sociales contempordneas en M6xico (Mexico, 1960), 73-96; Abelardo Villegas, "Esquemas para una historia de la filosofia en M6xico," Re- vista de historia de las ideas, I (1959), 191-215.

RAAT particular culture. A Chinese perspective was intellectually as valid as Western philosophy because every ideology was an organic expression of each society 's practical needs. This was also true for Mexican philosophy, he said.7 In 1934 Ramos published El perfil del hombre y la cultura en Mexico. In this work he explored the "Mexican circumstance" along psychoanalytic lines. His psychoanalysis of "lo mexicano" indicated that Mexican society, as an imitator of Anglo-Saxon culture, was suf- fering from an inferiority complex. The clinical solution was for Mexicans to engage in a process of self-analysis and become Mexicans. In order to arrive at self-understanding the Mexican must turn away from the instrumentalism and pragmatism of North American culture and arrive at a humanistic orientation which would be truly Mexican in nature and therefore solve the Mexican's spiritual crisis.8 Ramos incorporated some elements of this philosophical scheme into his fHistoria de la filosofica en Mexico. According to him, posi- tivism, as introduced by Gabino Barreda and modified by the followers of Spencer, served the needs of an educated and cultivated elite of middle-class Mexicans. Their popular interpretation of positivism was nothing other than a superficial sensualism. Losing all ethical con- tent, it became a rationalization of the animal instinct in man. Prior to 1910 the major opposition to positivism was found within or- ganized Catholicism, but after that time it was the skepticism of Justo Sierra and the activities of the Ateneo de la Juventud which suc- ceeded in overthrowing the tyranny of positivism. Mexican society could now find its owni salvation through a nativist philosophy which did not imitate the materialist and positivist attitudes of the Anglo- Saxon mind.9 Like many other Mexican writers of the 1940s, Leo- poldo Zea was exposed to Ortega's perspectivism through his associa- tion with Ramos. Ortega's themes of historical relativism and cul- tural pluralism were complemented by Zea with the type of "his- toricism" found in Karl Mannheim.10 'For a discussion of Ortega 's influence upon Ramos see Romanell, Making of the Mexican Mind, 163-166. 8 For his ideas of "imitativeness," "inferiority," and the "necessity of nativist philosophy," see Ramos, Proftie of Man and Culture, 15-43, 54-72, 151-156.

Carr in his What is History? (New York, 1962) 119, fn. 8, I feel no obligation to avoid using the term simply because Karl R. Popper has robbed it of any precise meaning in his Poverty of Historicism (London, 1957). I use the term in Mann- heim 's sense, i.e., the belief which denies the validity of absolute principles in history and insists upon the relational nature of ideas to social or historical cir- cumstances. For a discussion of the various meanings of historicism see Dwight</page><page sequence="5">LEOPOLDO ZEA AND MEXICAN POSITIVISM: A REAPPRAISAL 5 During the 1930s Spanish intellectuals in exile added a third ele- ment to the milieu of Mexican thinking, that of Heidegger's brand of German existentialism. Jose Gaos was particularly important in exer- cising this and other types of German philosophy upon Zea, who was his student. By 1948 Zea and others had formed a group called the Hiyperion. Employing an existentialist method, the Hyperion's main objective was to describe the peculiar Mexican situation and to dis- cover a national ethos.'1 This, then, was the intellectual climate of the 1940s in which Zea wrote his histories relating to positivism in Mexico.12 Zea's outline of positivism in Mexico was most fully developed in the two works, El positivismo en Mexico and Apogeo y decadencia del positivismo en Mexico. In the former book he investigated the theo- retical content of Comtean positivism and its role during the revolu- tionary movements of the nineteenth century. Comte's Mexican dis- ciple Gabino Barreda had introduced positivism to Mexico in an at- tempt to help create a new middle-class order along the lines of progress and peace. Zea argued that in due time the philosophy failed because the positivist notion of "order" became outdated and utopian and thereby no longer served Mexican needs. In the latter work Zea recounted the apogee and decline of positivism during the age of Diaz, 1876-1911. This second volume attempted to show how a Spencerian type of positivism was adapted to the political needs of "Porfirismo," and how the doctrine decayed into a crass rationalization of unre- stricted economic individualism which exploited the Mexican masses, especially the Indian. And finally Zea, like Ramos before him, pointed to the active role of the Ateneo in overthrowing Positivism after 1910. From these two major histories and from later articles Zea's his- tory of positivism can be constructed along the following lines. He began his outline in the early 1830s with the activities and thought of Mexico 's first theorist of the middle class, Jose Maria Luis Mora. Mora's theoretical sources were the utilitarian ethics of Bentham and Mill. According to Zea, Mora thought that the Mexican government of his day promoted only the narrow interests of clergy and army and was therefore the major source of Mexico's chaos and incessant revo- lutions. As the theoretician of liberalism, Mora believed that the only solution for Mexico's ills could be found in the adoption of English E. Lee and Robert N. Beck, "The Meaning of 'Historicism,' " American His- torical Review, LIX (April 1954), 568-577. " John L. Phelan surveys a group of Mexican writers who seek to discover a national ethos in his essay, "Mexico y lo Mexicano," HAHR, XXXVI (August 1956), 309-318. 12 See above, footnote 5.</page><page sequence="6">6 HAHR FEBRUARY WILLIAM D. RAAT and American political theory. This political theory represented the interests of the industrious middle class and taught that the role of government was to promote the ideals of the bourgeoisie in the areas of morality and industry. Mora also developed a theory of edu- cation which would help to lead Mexico along the road of progress and peace. In pushing his reforms, Mora was, as Zea called him, a "positive man." But, alas, Mora's liberal reforms were thwarted by the efforts of the reactionaries. It was only after the French were expelled in 1867 and their clerical supporters defeated that a new gen- eration of liberals could realize the educational ideals of the middle class. This was the work of a later generation of liberals who were Mexican positivists.13 Zea asserted that liberalism and positivism emerged triumphant from the Reforma in 1867. In the same year when Ju'arez had Em- peror Maximilian executed, Barreda, disciple and student of Auguste Comte, delivered his famous "Civic Prayer" in Guanajuato. Ac- cording to Zea, Barreda 's oration interpreted Mexico 's history in terms of Comte's "law of three stages." Mexico had evolved from the theological or colonial period through the metaphysical or revolu- tionary age to the contemporary epoch of victorious liberalism and positivism. During the following year Barreda was the most impor- tant force in the founding of the Escutela Nacional Preparatorita, which educated Mexico's second generation of positivists in Comte's hier- archy of sciences. Thus it was that Barreda fulfilled the tradition of Mora by introducing positivism to serve the class interests of the Mexican bourgeoisie.'4 The type of positivism which Barreda introduced to the educa- tional system of Mexico differed, however, from that about which his master Comte had lectured in Paris. For example Barreda made a major alteration in Comte's slogan, " Love, Order, and Progress." Although Comte had considered French liberalism a negative force, Barreda looked upon Mexican liberalism as a positive influence in the history of Mexico. He therefore changed Comte's slogan to "Lib- erty, Order, and Progress" to emphasize the liberal's past concern with liberty and freedom.15 According to Zea, from the very begin- ning the conservative ranks of clergy and army opposed Barreda's positivism. Also by 1868 Barreda's modification of Comte's philoso- phy led to a split in the liberal camp. The basic ideological issue was the meaning of "liberty" in Mexican life, for Barreda rejected the 3 Zea, "Positivism and Porfirism," 166-177. "Ibid., 177.

To him, true liberty had to be compatible with order, and individual freedom was limited by physical and social laws. Arguing by analogy, Barreda noted that when an object falls in nature, it is not truly free but sub- ject to the law of gravity. Accordingly the liberty of an individual consists "in his acting in accordance with these laws." This new eoncept immediately alienated the radical or "Jacobin" branch of combative liberalism, while the so-called moderates, accepting a re- stricted definition of freedom, became more positivistic."6 From 1868 to the late 1870s the Preparatory School educated a new generation of leaders in the "truths" of Comte and of Darwin, Mill, and Spencer as well. Thus there emerged a new generation of positivists who abandoned Comte for what Zea implied was the ma- terialistic or extreme positivism of Spencer. In 1877 Barreda's stu- dents organized the Asociacion Metoddfila "Gabino Barreda" to ex- plore the nature of organic society using positivist methods. As early as 1878 Justo Sierra and others published an organ called La Libertad, which proclaimed a new concept of "liberty" in terms of Spencerian positivism. La Libertad argued that Mexico had not yet evolved far enough to be ready for liberty, and that economic progress, based on political order, was a necessary prior condition to freedom. Thus, as Zea argues explicitly, the younger positivists left to the school of Barreda the task of contemplating the "metaphysical" nature of liberty. Barreda's chief agent in this task was none other than Agus- tin Aragon.'7 To continue Zea's narrative, the period between 1876 and 1892 was characterized politically by the rise of young positivists to important positions in the Diaz administration. By 1880 Justo Sierra's public pronouncements had gained him a place in the Chamber of Deputies. During that same year Pablo Macedo, Francisco Bulnes, and Rosendo Pineda followed him into the chamber. By 1889 Pineda had joined forces with Romero Rubio, Diaz' father-in-law, to organize a group of intellectuals in support of the Diaz regime. By 1892 this group had created a political party called the Union Liberal. It was at this time that the young positivists first started to come to political maturity.18 During this same period the major ideological issue was the con- " Zea, "Positivism and Porfirism," 180.

RAAT troversy over the role of logic in the Preparatory School. Justo Sierra and Porfirio Parra defended the logic of Mill and Bain from the at- tacks of Jose Maria Vigil. Vigil argued that posivitism was nothing other than an anarchistic doctrine, and that it was not even truly scientific. He insisted that positivism was an anti-social doctrine based upon sensualist notions of psychology and contrary to the liberal institutions of Mexico. As early as 1882 the positivists were nominal-- ly victorious with the adoption of Luis E. Ruiz' Nociones de l6gica, but the debate continued on through the next decade.19 The year 1892 was especially important in Zea's reconstruction of! Mexican history. This was the year in which the Union Liberal called a national convention to popularize the return of Porfirio Diaz ta the presidency. The party also published a manifesto, the purpose of which was to analyze the social problems of the country along scien- tific lines. Because of this emphasis on science, their political opposi- tion dubbed them the Party of Scientists, or the Cientificos. This: name was first applied only to the small group of intellectuals who formed the core of the party, but it was later expanded to include, those individuals influential in the Diaz administration who adopted the positivist credo. The spirit of the manifesto seemed to indicate that the Cientificos were simply heirs to the liberal tradition. However, a closer examina- tion revealed to Zea that although the authors of the manifesto insisted on the preservation and continuation of liberties by government,, they attached least importance to the right to vote. In other words, freedom of economic action, i.e. the right to invest, gather capital, and trade, was more important to them than the right to choose the gov- ernment. Positivism had now entered the political arena so as to ex- ercise some influence in orienting the Diaz dictatorship toward its, economic and social goals. Traditional Mexican liberalism had been transformed, at least in part, into a technical movement based on scien-- tific theories about economic progress.20 Zea was certain that the founders and signers of the Union Liberal manifesto of 1892 were in the same positivist tradition as the posi- tivists who had written for the newspaper La L2ibertad in 1878. Citing the authority of Aragon's Essai, he noted that such government ad- ministrators as Limantour and Fernandez Leal consciously employed techniques of positivism in making decisions. On the vague authority 1' Zea gave extensive treatment to the Parra-Vigil polemic in his Apogco y decadencia, 103-202. 20Apogeo y decadencia, 207-216; "Positivism and Porfirism," 185-188; "El positivismo," 263-267; Esquema, 22-24.</page><page sequence="9">LEOPOLDO ZEA AND MEXICAN POSITIVISM: A REAPPRAISAL 9 of Aragon alone, he assumed that Porfirismo was government which responded to the needs of a middle class and which sustained its position through a process of rationalization based upon positivist ideology.2' In 1910 and 1911 revolution swept away this corrupt form of Spencerian positivism which had justified a small political elite in its unregulated economic exploitation of the country. The perversion of Mora's tradition had finally brought about a political and intellectual movement which ended the rule of Diaz. In the ideological realm this revolution grew out of the positivist movement itself through the ac- tivities of the Ateneo de la Juventud. Jose Vasconcelos, Antonio Caso, and other revolutionary writers attacked positivism at a par- ticularly vulnerable point by calling it dogmatic and unscientific. Sue- ceeding where both Catholics and Jacobins had failed,22 this new gen- eration of philosophers would help to build a new society upon a phi- losophy which was strictly Mexican and not simply another Euro- pean or American imitation. Both Ortega y Gasset and Benedetto Croce influenced the shape of Zea's critical philosophy of history. From Ortega he learned that ab- solute ideas did not exist in an eternal sense but only in a circum- stantial way. Thought existed as a dialogue with the social circum- stances, i.e., ideology was merely the form in which a human being or a social group reacted to particular circumstances. The value of phi- losophy was to be found in its historical content. All philosophies were equally true in the sense that they were speculative constructs about reality which related to a particular social setting.23 From Croce Zea took the notion of the relation between the conceptual process and history. History was not possible without a concept of history formed by man in the process of thinking. Synthesizing the com- plementary views of Ortega and Croce, Zea said: "History is not possible without some element or concept, and, likewise, neither is philosophy possible without the intuitive, historical element. "24 Zea reasoned, therefore, that the proper study of philosophy was that of its origins, i.e., the historical circumstances. And since philosophy was not universal in any eternal sense but was rather a particular ex- pression of individual cultures, the study of positivism as an ideo- logical perspective of Mexican society was a justifiable pursuit. Thus 21 See either of Zea's works, El positivismo en Mexico, 188ff or Apogeo y de- cadencia, 15. 22 Zea, Apogeo y decadencia, 259-268; Zea, "Positivism and Porfirism," 189- 191; Zea, Esquema, 24-28. 22 Zea, El positivismo en Me6xico, 24-27. 24 Ibid., 25.</page><page sequence="10">10 HAHR I FEBRUARY I WILLIAM D. RAAT Zea set out to analyze the ideology of positivism in its relationship to Mexican historical events and in so doing undertook a type of intel- lectual history. How successful was he in employing the methodologi- cal techniques of intellectual history? To answer this question an investigation of Zea's methodology is necessary. Along with Croce's idealism and Ortega's perspectivism and ethical relativism, Zea adopted the fundamental assumptions behind Max Scheler 's and Karl Mannheim 's " Sociology of Knowledge. " The synthesis of these views formed the basis underlying Zea's assump- tions concerning the role of ideology in history. Mannheim's "his- toricism" taught that ideas were relational in nature. By that he meant that ideology was a relative mental construct designed to relate to and meet the needs of social circumstances. A similar concept could have several manifestations in the same culture. These different mani- festations would all relate to different social groups experiencing various social conditions. As Zea quoted Mannheim, "each group will attempt to interpret a particular concept in accordance with its in- terests. " 25 This meant for Zea that positivism was nothing other than an ideological justification for Mexico's rising middle class. When positivism came to lose its functional character and ceased to meet the social needs of Mexico's middle class, the middle class (especially the Ateneo) replaced this philosophy with a nativist one related to Mex- ico's peculiar situation. Any critique of Zea's method would have to take into account Zea's uncritical reliance upon Mannheim's historicism. The central theme of Mannheim's philosophy of history was that there could be no such thing as the classic liberal conception of an objective, unbiased truth. Man's thinking about social problems was selective in that it always represented a particular point of view and served some special interest. Mannheim went further than Marx in stating that all think- ing, including the ideology of Marxism, was socially determined. Yet Mannheim's skepticism was not purely negative. He believed that this type of relationalism or relativism could lead to a new definition of objective knowledge. Mankind could embrace a different type of ob- jectivity through an awareness of the limited and partial view of all ideology. With a realization of the limitations of ideology man could enter sympathetically into ideologies other than his own. Sympa- thetic imagination woud enable man to gain objective truth in the psychological sense of unifying all individual perspectives. To create 25 Ibid., 30.</page><page sequence="11">LEOPOLDO ZEA AND MEXICAN POSITIVISM: A REAPPRAISAL 11 this condition of objective truth was the role of a special class in so- ciety, the intellectual elites.26 Zea 's entire typology fitted well in Mannheim 's scheme. Posi- tivism, like all ideologies, had to serve the interest of a special class. From Mora in the 1830s through Justo Sierra in the 1880s to the Cientificos after 1892, the role of positivism was one of attending the needs of Mexico's middle class. In general, positivism had to be a passive factor reflecting the material and social forces of Mexican society. Committed to this philosophical position, Zea's histories were more speculative than historical in the empirical sense. Zea rarely at- tempted to demonstrate the active role of positivism in shaping Mex- ico's history. And his treatment of the overthrow of positivism tended to overemphasize the role of the intellectual in society. Zea's history gave credit to the intellectual elites of the Ateneo for the downfall of positivism and the rise of a mystical and universal philosophy which defined objectivity in a spiritual or psychological form. Given Zea's reliance upon the relationship of ideology to social classes, it would be reasonable to assume that Zea would have in- volved himself in some type of class analysis of Diaz' Mexico. Zea, like many Mexican writers, did not employ a sociological approach to his study of positivism's role in Mexican society. In other words, Zea made no attempt, either through personal research or by reference to other sociological studies, to demonstrate his fundamental assump- tion-that ideology, especially positivism, correlated in its expressions to specific social groups and as such served the special needs of these groups. Zea was content with the vague expression "middle class" and did not concern himself with the fact that this overused phrase was devoid of any special meaning. In none of Zea's many books and es- says was there an attempt to develop a structural analysis of Mexican institutions such as the Catholic Church or of such formal groups as the Cientifico clique. Zea was also unaware of the subtleties of deci- sion-making and the possibility that formal groups such as the Cien- tificos might coalesce into some tangent group of an informal nature like the Sociedad Amigos del Presidente for purposes of policy-mak- ing. A structural analysis of the Porfiriato is an undertaking of the first magnitude, and because of this it should be understood that Zea's mistake was not so much one of aberrance as of simple omission.27 28 For a critique of Manaheim 's philosophy of history see Charles Frankel, The Case for Modern Maan (Boston, 1959), 117-145. 27 The classical sociological analysis of the DI'az era was done by Andr6s Molina Enrfquez. See Los grandes problemas nacionales (M6xico, 1909). A re- cent study of A. Gonztlez Cosio is in agreement with the traditional picture.</page><page sequence="12">12 HAHR I FEBRUARY I WILLIAM D. RAAT Zea was also uncritical concerning the problem of social change. For decades "muckraking" and liberal historians, in an attempt to justify the Revolution, had peopled the prerevolutionary scene with underworld characters such as Porfirio Diaz and Jose' Limantour, who, with others, had engaged in a conspiracy to exploit Mexico's human and natural resources. Zea's discussion of the revolutionary Ateneo was filled with implications about the unethical character of the posi- tivism of an entrenched bureaucracy. The possibility that positivism was a constructive force leading to economic development with inher- ent social dislocations was not considered by Zea. It can be noted that recent writers have entertained the hypothesis that revolution in Mex- ico was more a result of higher standards of living than of political suppression.28 Although Zea did make extensive use of La Libertad and other Mexican newspapers, his documentation was often based upon either literary or philosophical sources, or upon the secondary authority of Aragon and Ramos. Because of this, his pursuit of Mexican "circum- stances" has to be considered as either history of philosophy or as internal history of ideas. Possibly one explanation for this tendency is that Zea more often asked the ontological question, "What is the Mexican?" rather than the sociological one, "What is the social status of the so-called Mexican positivist? "29 Several critics and reviewers have commented upon this aspect of Zea's methodology. In reference to El positivismo en Mexico, Alfonso Gareia Ruiiz noted Zea's preoccupation with internal analysis of philo- sophical texts and his neglect of the Mexican " eircumstances. " Stan- ley Stein, although content with Zea's earlier works on positivism, did suggest that Zea failed "to detail the cultural matrix, the national 'urgencies' and 'historical circumstances' shaping the adoption of positivism in each country studied." And finally, Moises Gonzalez Navarro stated that Zea's method relied upon secondary sources and as such was based upon a few personalities such as Mora and Justo Sierra to the exclusion of a realistic historical picture.30 Another re- This work noted that a small national bourgeoisie used its privileged position to work against the interests of the peasant, the proletariat, and even the discon- tented elements of the middle elass.

This inclined Zea to the use of stereotyped notions which were devoid of precise meaning. Charles Griffin remarked in a review of one of Zea's recent works that his view of the past "opens the way to tendencies that Huizinga has referred to as 'inflation of terms, stereotypes, and anthropomorphism.' "31 Precise language, important for all historical disciplines, is es- pecially critical in the writing of intellectual history. All too often we encounter such fuzzy terms as "the Mexican Mind" or "the Spirit of the Age." Zea did not always choose his terminology carefully. The most obvious example was his peculiar and ambiguous use (or mis- use) of the term "positivism." Taking his lead from Horaci4 Ba- rreda, the son of Gabino Barreda, Zea argued that positivism had to be considered only as incomplete or complete positivism. A positivist should not be called a Comtean positivist, because Comte himself was an incomplete positivist. To Zea positivists were simply those individ- uals who in all of their investigations applied the positive method.32 Positivism was not to be defined as a doctrine formulated and de- veloped by Comte and his French disciples, but rather as a method of investigation which was universal in nature. It would seem to fol- low that this method was more that of the scientific approach in general than of Comte's positivistic procedures in particular. One difficulty with this definition was that it categorized as posi- tivistic the very different philosophies of Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer. As noted above, Zea said that the second generation of positivists had been schooled in the doctrines of Mill and Spencer. The age of Diaz was characterized ideologically as the age of Spencer's Social Darwinism or extreme positivism. Yet a very superficial reading of Mill's critique of Comte's phi- losophy would indicate the obvious, i.e., Mill's brand of thinking was quite different from that of Comte's. Even Mill himself noted a ten- dency in England for thinkers to be erroneously labeled "positivist" and their philosophy, "positivism." Differing in attitude from Comte, Mill asserted that Comte's last volume in his Systeme de Politique Positive was "in some respects a still sadder picture of intellectual vista de Bistoria de Am6rica, XVI (December 1943), 223; Stanley J. Stein, "CThe Latin-American Mind, by Leopoldo Zea, " Political Science Quarterly, LXXX (March 1965), 156; Moises Gonzalez Navarro, "Educacion y trabajo en eI Por- firiato," BEistoria Mexicana, VI (April-June 1957), 620-622. 31 Charles C.

RAAT degeneracy than those which preceded it." In the conclusion to his criticism of Comte's Cours de Philosophie Positive, Mill insisted that Comte had "done nothing in Sociology which does not require to be done over again, and better." And finally in a letter to the French positivist Littre, he confessed that most of Comte's sociological opin- ions were "diametrically opposed to mine." Although Zea was aware of these differences between Mill and Comte, his imprecise use of the term "positivism" did not always indicate this awareness.33 The same can be said for those particular differences which placed Spencer's system in opposition to Comte's. Spencer, unlike the ideo- logical determinism of Comte, considered human emotions and psy- chological forces as central determinants in the evolutionary movement of society. To Spencer, emotions are "mainly predetermined," while beliefs are "mainly postdetermined.' 34 Another major distinction between the two thinkers was that Comte's philosophy was a theory of history which was quite different from Spencer's theory of biologi- cal growth. Comte believed that although biology could provide guide lines to human nature, the actual course of social development was ul- timately found in a study of historical evidence. The result of Comte's method was a history of science based upon his dubious "law of three stages. " It was also unfortunate that Zea often equated "positivism" with ideas and activities which writers today would call "scientism." Zea assumed, especially in his review of essays appearing in La Libertad, that authors who accepted the scientific method and shared an atti- tude of admiration for the use of the scientific method in the study of society were either inspired by Comte or accepted his philosophy of positivism. Yet positivism was much more than a method, it was a philosophy of history which postulated stages of history directing themselves progressively towards a scientific end.35 One other observation should be made concerning Zea's method- ology. This was Zea's failure to record instances of negative results. A cursory examination of the literature of the Porfiriato would indi- cate that in most instances newspapers and government materials were 3 The first two quotations were taken from John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte and Positivism, 190, 124.

Limantour, a key Cientifico and thereby leader of the so-called political positivists, is a good ex- ample of a personality whose correspondence indicates little which could be considered Comtean philosophy.36 At this point it is necessary to outline Zea's speculative philosophy of history and to see how his treatment of positivism fits neatly into his dominant world view. As has been already observed, he borrowed gen- erously from the perspectivism of Ortega and the historicism of Mann- heim. To these fundamental positions he then added some of the themes which are to be found in Heidegger's type of existentialism. His philosophy of history was first consciously developed in 1945 in a monograph entitled En torno a una ftlosof'a americama. Zea ar- gued that a truly continental American philosophy was possible if and when the American circumstances demanded it. Zea believed that the Americas could not only produce a circumstantial philosophy which would meet the needs of America's vital situation, but could also achieve a universal truth through awareness of the common circum- stances of "humanity. " The history of Mexico and of all America had been characterized by the cultural dominance of Europe. Mexicans during the Porfiriato "anglicized" their own values in a desperate attempt to imitate North American and European standards. The result was a failure and only revealed that Mexico was suffering from a national inferiority complex. The only solution for this situation, and his diagnosis and treatment applied equally well to North America, was for Mexico to mature and become conscious of her own peculiar circumstances. With maturity would come a new philosophy of the Americas. This philosophy would at first be national or Mexican in content but would soon develop into a truly continental philosophy of universal validity.37 Zea conceived of Mexico's history, from the conquest to the Revolu- tion of 1910, solely as a tendency towards indiscriminate Europeaniza- tion. Early Christian missionaries, the creole leaders after Indepen- dence, and the Cientificos of the Diaz period all sought to Europeanize the natives without taking into account Mexico's conditions. This trend was first reversed in 1910 when Mexico left Europe behind and So See Jose Ives Limantour, Correspondencia, 1848-1911, 402 1., Garcia Collec- tion of the University of Texas Library.

Mexico was now repudiating the Occidental's claim to universality by offering to the world a uni- versal philosophy which found its origin in a discovery of the "Mexican. " 238 The tone underlying this philosophy was existential. Anguished man could only achieve his realization through recognition of the temporality of the human condition. The themes were those of meta- physical despair and the necessity of human freedom achieved through individual or particularistic decisions. The existential quality of Zea's writings meant that man was an entity whose being consisted not only in what he was, but in what he may become. His task as an ex- istential historian was to use history to illustrate how past conditions delimit future alternatives. Zea's point of departure was himself, or man as an individual, or "lo mexicano." His orientation was the future.39 To the existential mood of his writings Zea then added an ingre- dient common to Ramos and other Mexican writers, i.e., psychoanalysis of Mexican culture. His survey of Mexico did delimit future alterna- tives in that Mexico had suffered an inferiority complex from her experiences with Europe and the United States. Mexico could only achieve her realization through an awareness of her past imitative condition. Through a knowledge of her own history, Mexico could liberate herself from subconscious resentments which had thwarted Mexico's self-expression. This, then, was the speculative thought which pervaded Zea's his- tories of positivism. The exercise of positivism during the days of Diaz was an artificial and soul-damaging experience. Like Ortega, Zea really believed in metahistory, rather than history proper. His histories suffered not so much from that which plagues most history writing, namely presentism, but rather from futurism. Because of the inadequate methodology employed by Zea in his research, it is unfortunate, although understandable, that Zea's his- tories should have become the archetype for subsequent writings on Mexican positivism. It would be unfair and incomplete to present a critique of Zea without attempting to derive several lessons about how intellectual history writing of his type could be improved and re- directed in the future. The following observations make no claim to either originality or authority in any final sense, but are only intended S8 See Phelan, " M6xieo y lo Mexieano, " 314. 1 Ibid., 314-315.

The historical significance of any idea in any historical circumstance is an open question subject to investigation. No formula must as- sume that ideas are strictly passive or mere reflections of social cir- cumstances, nor can any mode of analysis simply assign "influence" or "causation" to ideas without an attempt at demonstrating the same. Zea not only committed himself to the historicist assertion concerning the passive and reflective role of ideas, but, in spite of the apparent contradiction, also asserted a special active role for positivism in the history of Diaz' Mexico, based, for the most part, on the inadequate testimony of Agustin Aragon (an orthodox posi- tivist) and Justo Sierra. 2. As in all history writing, intellectual history writing should employ proper internal criticism of available documentary material. Since the possibility exists that positivism as a formal ideology had only a very limited and academic role to play in Mexico's history, any investigation of documentation should be very inclusive and note instances of negative results. If one implies that positivism was the political and official philosophy of Mexico, then extensive treatment of political publications (such as La Libertad, El Imparcial, El Mundo llustrado, El Mundo, etc.), as well as the private and public writings of the several so-called Cientificos (i.e., in addition to Sierra, the writings of Limantour, Pablo and Miguel Macedo, Fran- cisco Bulnes, Joaquin Casasu's, Ramon Corral, Manuel Flores, En- rique Creel, etc.) should be worthy of investigation. 3. If ideas be considered as intellectual devices by means of which a social group deals with the events it experiences and if therefore the social context of ideas be a proper object of analysis, then no ap- proach is complete which does not attempt to develop a valid model or framework. Unlike Zea's speculative and ontological model, this framework should be more historical and/or sociological in nature. Conceptual schemes, whether chronological, structural, or functional, should be considered only as aids to research and should never be given the status of "objective realities," apart from their use as aids in investigation. A major difficulty of Zea's works was that his re- search started with the methodological assumptions of "historicism' and "perspectivism," but in the process of writing these investigative assumptions were transformed into a theory of being. 4. Any approach to the history of thought, like Zea's, which examines ideas apart from questions of their social origin and influence and is characterized by a philosophical or literary approach, should be considered as "philosophy of ideas" rather than as intellectual his- tory proper. In this respect the value of Zea's works is found in his contributions to contemporary "nativist" trends in Mexican phi- losophy and to modern social psychology. 5. And finally, terminology in the discipline of intellectual history writ- ing (which is infamous for its glossary of "influences," "currents,'</page><page sequence="18">18 HAHR j FEBRUARY I WILLIAM D. RAAT "the Mexican Mind," and "the Spirit of the Age") should be con- structed carefully. Before the historical impact of positivism can be measured, the historian should be aware of the object of his in- vestigation and not define positivism in a diffused way, so that as an ideology it is indistinguishable from Social Darwinism, social evolution, physical determinism, or scientism. By way of conclusion, it must be stated that the present effort to evaluate Zea's works does not call into question his integrity as a historian or his high standing in the community of scholars. Rather it has been based on the assumption that history writing is a partial and continuous process characterized by constant revision of open questions. The fact that Zea's studies are worthy of a critical audi- ence testifies to the importance and significance of his classical con- tribution to the field of historical thought in general.</page></plain_text>
