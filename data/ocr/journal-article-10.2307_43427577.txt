<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFLUENCE OF THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT ON MODERN POETRY By E. A. FISHER Balliol College , Oxford ; and S.E. Agricultural College , Wye " Poetry," says Leigh Hunt, " is the utterance of a passion for truth, beauty, and power, embodying and illustrating its con- ceptions by imagination and fancy, and modulating its language on the principle of variety in uniformity. Its means are what- ever the Universe contains ; and its ends, pleasure and exaltation. Poetry stands between nature and convention, keeping alive among us the enjoyment of the external and the spiritual worlds ; and, next to Love and Beauty, which are its parents, is the greatest proof to man of the pleasure to be found in all things, and of the probable riches of infinitude. . . . Poetry," he con- tinues, " begins where matters of fact or of science cease to be merely such, and it exhibits a further truth ; that is, the connec- tion science has with the world of emotion, and its power of producing imaginative pleasure. Inquiring of a gardener, for instance, what flower it is we see yonder, he answers, ' a lily.' This is a matter of fact. The botanist pronounces it to be of the order Hexandria monogynia. This is a matter of science. It is the 'lady' of the garden, says Spenser; and here we begin to have a poetical sense of its fairness and grace. It is ' the plant and flower of light,' says Ben Jonson ; and poetry then shows us the beauty of the flower in all its mystery and splendour." This was written some eighty years ago, when science was in its infancy, or rather in that embryo stage in which all science is purely descriptive, but it shows us clearly enough that, even in those early days of scientific thought, the best literary minds of the time saw clearly that in matters of poetry, as in matters of fact and of science, we see " the same feet of nature treading in différent ways " ; that the most scornful and dullest disciple of fact should be cautious how he betrays the shallowness of his philosophy by discerning no poetry in its depths. It is indeed 738</page><page sequence="2">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 739 not too much to say that science and poetry are twin sisters, so intimately bound up are they each with the other. That there is some real connection between science and poetry - some direct and real influence of what we call the scientific movement upon poetry - is easily discernible and be- comes very evident when we remember, as we must, that although the poet, like all genius, is born, not made, that is, although genius is largely independent of time and place, he is never- theless and necessarily, and to no inconsiderable extent, a pro- duct of his age, both as regards form and content. For example, Mrs. Browning, Tennyson, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold - to take a few at random of the greatest of the Victorian poets - have indelibly impressed the poetry of their era. But it must not be forgotten that their greatness - even though it be the greatness of genius - does not alter the fact that what they thought and what they wrote was in large measure determined for them by the circumstances and ideas of the time in which they lived. This fact, though obvious, is often obscured in the minds of those people who talk of great men as being not of an age, but for all time. It is undoubtedly true that great poets, philosophers, artists, statesmen, and great men of all kinds, if they are only great enough, are for all time ; but it is equally true that they are, in a sense, of their own age first of all. Shakespeare is perhaps the first example, as well as the best, that comes to one's mind. His literary form, the atmosphere of his poetry - what one might call the mental dialect in which it was written ; that is, the presuppositions which he carried with him to his work and which he owed entirely to his education and environment - many of his characteristic interests are Elizabethan. His morality, too, is essentially that of the age of the later Tudors - so much, indeed, is this the case that there are not wanting Mrs. Grundys at the present day who would willingly banish some of his plays altogether from the stage. Again, the drama was the most popular form of literature ; and he wrote mainly dramas. Subjects from English History possessed a special interest for his audience and had a special fascination for writers of his time ; and he wrote English historical plays. The fact, therefore, that Shakespeare is for all time does not prevent his being, in a very real sense, of an age, and of his own age. Similar considerations apply to all writers of every age and clime. However great a man may be, the world is</page><page sequence="3">74Ö SCIENCE PROGRESS greater, and we can only hope to understand the man and his- work in so far as we view him in his relation to the spirit and thought of his age. This being so, it is easy to see that the influence of science on poetry is not a mere figment of a perverted imagination, but is as real as it is lasting ; for the spirit of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was, and is, essentially scientific ; and by " scientific " one must not be understood to mean " materialistic," which is a philo- sophical and not a scientific term, and so outside the scope of this article. By the scientific spirit is meant merely submission to the conception of universal law. The greatest intellectual triumph of the early part of the nine- teenth century was the establishment of the two laws of the uniformity of Nature and of universal causation on a firm basis of experience, and the consequent elimination of the supernatural from natural phenomena. Such an intellectual revolution could not fail in leaving its mark upon contemporary literature, for the simple reason that it altered our whole con- ception of the relation of man to the Universe. This influence has sometimes been deplored on the ground that science means the disappearance of mystery and of super- stition and so takes away from the poet a great deal of his raw material. The idea is quite a wrong one. It is true, indeed, it is universally admitted that natural science has had the greatest possible influence in the extirpation of superstition; but this in no way limits the activity of the poet. The error is based on a confusion in thought. Superstition is not a necessary nor a permanent possession of mankind ; it is but a phase - although an inevitable one - in human history. During the period of infancy - alike of the race as of the individual - in which the power of thought is but slightly developed, and the reason hardly more than a rudiment, the form given by this faculty of thought to the impressions of the senses is very imperfect and only superficially correct. But during his development man acquires a considerable knowledge of himself, and his know- ledge of himself has, and must necessarily have, an immense influence on his comprehension of the world. He embodies all his feelings, his desires, his fancies into the sensible world, and imagines that everything around him is living, feeling, and desiring as he is. He, in fact, does and can only regard phenomena in terms of his own consciousness. He does the</page><page sequence="4">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 74 l same in religion. It was once said by a Frenchman - I forget his name - " In the beginning God created man in His own image, and since then man has returned the compliment by creating God in his." The jibe - for jibe it was- is really the expression of a fundamental truth : among all the lower and early religions, even as in our own, the conception of God is- essentially anthropomorphic like primitive man's conception of Nature. This inner world, which man thus creates for himself, is a world of poetry and is very different from that which he afterwards acquires from his thoughts, but neverthe- less this childish comprehension of the world is in peculiar harmony with things as they appeared to our ingenuous ancestor. We may say, in fact, that if poetry could be the pre- vailing sentiment in the world, the life of man would be one harmonious whole, but at the same time his comprehension of the world would be vague and dreamy. He would not be fully conscious, if at all, of the rational connection between phenomena. He has to be led, so to speak, by knowledge - that is, by science, which is only organised knowledge - to the point where thought and poetry will no longer be opposed. This intellectual development is forced upon man by the very constitution of Nature. Nature does not permit man to bury himself in a world of poetry and he is prevented from doing so by external influences; objects intrude themselves which require his constant consideration. Irresistible impressions and thoughts appear in prominent distinctness, and oblige him to look at things in a new manner. This induces one of twa opposite sensations : either joy and satisfaction at the new idea that he finds revealed to his ken, or discontent at the. encroach- ment which has been made into his habitual view of the world. Either will have a direct influence on the expression of his thoughts and ideas in poetic form. It is the latter idea that dominates those who deplore the disappearance of mystery and superstition on the plea that it means a serious loss to the poet, and hence to the world. It is not so. The muse of the poet is the eternal beautiful - and, surely, truth is the highest expression of the beautiful ; as Browning has it : Ah ! world as God has made it ! Truth is beauty, And knowing this is love, and love is duty. I think we may say, then, that the poet not only cannot, but</page><page sequence="5">742 SCIENCE PROGRESS ought not even to attempt to, get away from contemporary life and activity on the mistaken idea that he serves the eternal beautiful ; or, rather, under a misapprehension as to what the eternal beautiful is. Whatever men think, do, suffer, hope is the poet's theme. Poetry therefore must change with life and grow with thought and will never suffer from a scarcity of subject-matter until life and thought alike have disappeared. It is true that only recently have we begun to awaken to this ■conception of the function of poetry. In the middle of the nineteenth century a materialistic anti-poetic movement swept over the intellectual world to the great detriment of poetic expression. One must always be thankful that such a move- ment was transient, even evanescent, in its nature and in its •effects on poetry; but this movement again was an inevitable phase in the intellectual development of mankind, and to it we owe our present firm belief in the universality of law and our rejection of the old theological ideas of the causeless, the arbitrary, the capricious in the government of Nature. It arose out of an attempt to correct the false perspective of previous generations, and like all attempts at re-adjustment erred through its very exaggeration ; we find the same exaggeration to-day in the ideas of such writers as Tolstoi and G. B. Shaw. We see then that there are two ways of regarding the natural world - first, as it appears to the bodily eye and to the normal untutored imagination ; secondly, as we know it actually is, having sought out the truth of its phenomena, and the laws which underlie their beauty or repulsiveness. The former, although purely empirical, was formerly the raw material on which the poet worked ; the latter is due to that spirit of inquiry which we call the scientific movement. The materialism of the middle nineteenth century was due to an attempted transition from one point of view to the other - an attempt, however, which from its very violence carried the intellectual pendulum far beyond its point of equilibrium into a position in which it was as unstable as it was before. Thus Huxley in a lecture on " Scientific Education" in 1869 deplored the fact that " at present, education is almost entirely devoted to the cultivation of the power of expression and of the sense of literary beauty." The spirit of the conflict is aptly summed up by another writer who says : " The truth is that our school-girls and spinsters wander down the lanes with Darwin, Huxley, and</page><page sequence="6">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 743 Spencer under their arms ; or if they have Tennyson, Longfellow, or Morris, read them in the light of Spectrum Analysis or test them by the economics of Mill and Bain." Such a conflict, however inevitable, was necessarily short-lived. Many of the greater minds of the time regretted it and looked forward to the day when reconciliation should come and " so far from being unfriendly to the poetic imagination, science will breathe into it a higher exaltation." The poets themselves recognised the necessity of the struggle, while looking forward with calmness, serenity, and certain hope to reconciliation and mutual help. The poets' feelings did not belie them - we are growing to recognise the fact that poetry is largely the expression of thoughts, ideas, feelings, many of which are founded and generated by science. The essays of Tyndall and Huxley are, the question of form apart, poems in themselves ; and there are both philosophers and poets who feel that no absolute antagon- ism can exist between them. The mission of science is to struggle against the unknown; while in letters it is enough to give an expression, and in art a body, to the conceptions of the mind or the beauties of Nature. In other words, science kindles the imagination with new conceptions and new beauties which it has wrested from the unknown, and thus becomes the ally of poetry. On the other hand, although, as has been pointed out, science is the ally of poetry, it must not be forgotten that poetry is, in no less real a sense, the ally of science. The intuition of the poet often anticipates scientific discoveries ; we see this in fiction in the novels of Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, and in those of H. G. Wells. In poetry a single example will suffice: when the theory of Evolution had been definitely established in science it was regarded merely as the process by which man and the Universe in general had arrived at their present condition, and inferences from it with regard to the future were put forward in a purely tentative manner, merely as suggestions containing perhaps a certain amount of speculative interest. The poet, however, with his prophetic insight seized on the theory and pushed it at once to its logical conclusion ; he Dipt into the future far as human eye could see ; Saw the vision of the world and all the wonder that would be ; and many of his speculations are now accepted as beliefs by men of science, if not as scientists at any rate as thinkers. 48</page><page sequence="7">744 SCIENCE PROGRESS One must not forget, in passing, the independence of the poet - as the scientist has his own independent field of work, the investi- gation of the laws of Nature, so also has the poet. In his case it is the expression of the spirit of Nature. It is where these two spheres of activity - the investigation of the laws of Nature and the expression of the spirit of Nature - overlap that we find the common ground of science and poetry; but whereas science reaches it by an analysis of natural phenomena, poetry attains it by that direct intuition which is the poetic characteristic par excellence. Then again this common ground, where science and poetry meet and join hands, is an elusive thing, which though easy to recognise is by no means easy to describe without taking personal factors into account ; it is so largely a matter of temperament. It has been said that " visible beauty exalts our emotions far more than a dissection of the wondrous and intricate systems beneath it. The sight of a star or of a flower, or the story of a single noble action, touches our humanity more nearly than the greatest discovery or invention could ever do and does the soul more good." The passage is a striking one and expresses a belief that is all too general ; but though true in a sense it contains a confusion in thought which it is not difficult to point out. Although a noble action may appeal to us and to our human sympathy more strongly than the latest scientific dis- covery, say that of aërial locomotion, it is because its very nature is human, it pertains of the very essence of humanity ; while the latter is something extraneous, without which the world would probably be as well off. The world was no less beautiful in the days before artificial means of locomotion came into being, but we can scarcely conceive a world so ugly, so repulsive, so utterly devoid of beauty that nobility of thought, word, and deed was unknown ; we cannot conceive a humanity so inhuman as to be devoid of human sympathy and utterly unresponsive to nobility and beauty of thought and action. The former part of the argument, however, belongs to quite another plane, and I think one may say safely that " the sight of a star or of a flower " does not " touch our humanity more nearly," or anything like as nearly, as a " dissection of the wondrous and intricate systems " that lie beneath the object ; or as an analysis of the processes underlying its growth and development ; for by the very act of dissection or analysis new beauties and fresh wonders are revealed to our ken which far surpass those laid bare by a</page><page sequence="8">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 745 mere sight of the object. The poets themselves realise this; when Tennyson said, Flower in the crannied wall, I pluck you out of the crannies ; - Hold you here, root and all, in my hand, Little flower - but if I could understand What you are, root and all, and all in all, I should know what God and man is, it was not the mere sight of the beauty of the flower that touched him, but the thought that that same little flower was an integral part, however small a one, in a more wondrous whole we call Nature ; it was the innumerable beauties laid bare by thought and reflection founded on investigation and knowledge that touched the poet's nature and enriched our language with a poetic gem of such surpassing beauty ; and it is the same know- ledge in us, likewise based on a study of Nature's laws and processes, that alone enables us to recognise its beauty. But enough of the general nature of the influence of the scientific movement on poetry. One comes naturally to inquire into some of the more direct effects of scientific ideas on the form and expression adopted in modern poetry. Such an inquiry can only be carried out by an appeal to the poets themselves and by a study of their works. For this purpose we will take Tennyson as our chief example, since it is better to make a detailed examination of one poet than a diffusive and cursory glance at many. Moreover, besides being one of the greatest and one of the most typical of modern poets, Tennyson was a scientific observer of no mean order and his scientific knowledge, if not profound, was at least exact and of unusual width ; while he enjoyed the extra advantage (for our present purpose, at any rate) of being a friend of Darwin's - of all modern scientists the one most deficient in, I had almost said devoid of, poetic feeling; a defect which no one deplored more than he did himself. Perhaps the first real scientific idea introduced into poetry was the idea of vastness - vastness of space, and later still the vastness of time. One might at first think that the conception of mere immensity is, emotionally speaking, a barren one ; it is not so in reality. Who does not know, who has not felt the awe and wonderment, the subdued reverence with which we gaze up at the starry heavens in the darkness and silence of the night !</page><page sequence="9">746 SCIENCE PROGRESS How insignificant and even humble we ourselves are compelled to feel, even against our wills, when we realise how small a part we, and our earth on which we live, play in the totality of things ! Or, to change the point of view, how happy we feel, what a quiet sense of pleased satisfaction we get when we realise that the part we play, even though it be so small, is an essential one and that we form an integral part of that scheme of things we call the Universe. This sense of awe is admirably expressed by Byron in his dramatic poem Cain ; Cain is being borne through space by Lucifer and is overcome with awe as millions of stars seem to flash past him and he loses sight of earth - O thou beautiful And unimaginable ether ! and Ye multiplying masses of increased And still increasing lights ! what are ye ? What Is this blue wilderness of interminable Air, where ye roll along, as I have seen The leaves along the limpid streams of Eden ? Is your course measured for ye ? Or do ye Sweep on in your unbounded revelry Through an aerial universe of endless Expansion - at which my soul aches to think - Intoxicated with eternity? O God ! O Gods ! or whatsoe'er ye are ! How beautiful ye are ! how beautiful Your works, or accidents ! or whatsoe'er They may be ! Let me die as atoms die (If that they die), or know ye in your might And knowledge 1 My thoughts are not in this hour Unworthy what I see, though my dust is ; Spirit, let me expire, or see them nearer ; Lucifer . Art thou not nearer ? Look back to thine earth ! Cain. Where is it? I see nothing save a mass Of most innumerable lights. Lucifer . Look there ! Cain . I cannot see it. Lucifer. Yet it sparkles still ! Cain . That! Yonder! Lucifer. Yea. Cain . And wilt thou tell me so ? Why I have seen the fire-flies and fire-worms Sprinkle the dusky groves and the green banks In the dim twilight, brighter than yon world Which bears them. The idea of the vastness of space was first introduced into science by Copernicus and was afterwards extended by such</page><page sequence="10">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 747 intellectual giants as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. To the immensity of space was added the immensity of time by Darwin and his co-workers. Perhaps no scientific idea has been so fruitful of results in its effects upon philosophy and religion, for it was a discovery which at once caused a vague disquietude in the minds of men. The universe ceased suddenly to be homocentric. Man seemed to become at once utterly insig- nificant ; a mere speck of animated dust ; a parasite of one of the meanest of the planets. As Tennyson says : What are men that He should heed us ? cried the King of sacred song ; Insects of an hour, that hourly work their brother-insects wrong, While the silent Heavens roll, and suns along their fiery way, All their planets whirling round them, flash a million miles a day. And again, in that awful, gloomy, pessimistic poem Despair , he says : And the suns of the limitless Universe sparkled and shone in the sky, Flashing with fires as of God, but we knew that their light was a lie - Bright as with deathless hope - but however they sparkled and shone, The dark little worlds running round them were worlds of woe like our own- No soul in the heaven above, no soul on the earth below, A fiery scroll written over with lamentation and woe. And yet again, in a more cheerful vein, he writes : For tho' the Giant Ages heave the hill And break the shore, and evermore Make and break, and work their will ; Tho' world on world in myriad myriads roll Round us, each with different powers, And other forms of life than ours, What know we greater than the soul? The immensity of time, too, is realised : Many an aeon moulded earth before her highest, Man, was born, Many an aeon too may pass when earth is manless and forlorn. It is small wonder indeed that the greatest minds have been frightened and have recoiled in blank dismay from the concep- tion of such immensity as this ! " Man began to wonder how far he could still maintain moral laws and ideals of life formu- lated under other and different conditions, conditions when he was able to regard himself not only as the centre but as the</page><page sequence="11">748 SCIENCE PROGRESS object of creation. ' The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth His handiwork,' said the Psalmist ; 4 the heavens declare no glory but that of Newton and Kepler' seemed to be the conclusion of modern science ;* and Laplace, in his great treatise Mécanique Celeste, admitted that in his system he could find no place for a God." The situation has been aptly summed up by Haeckel when he said, 14 We have learnt to look upon the sun shining out of a godless heaven upon a soulless earth." It is quite evident that our apprehension of man's littleness and the greatness of the Universe has a disquieting effect upon the human mind and tends to point out the futility of moral effort and the absurdity of mental speculation. All these questions and problems were raised and suggested by this one scientific idea. The answers, if answers there are, must be sought in philosophy and in the works of the poets; this is neither the place nor the time for such philosophical disquisitions - the object of this article is to point out that such questions were raised by science ; we must go to the poets for an answer. The next idea which has been introduced by science is the conception of law and order in the Universe. This question has already been touched upon, so we may pass it over here, and proceed at once to a consideration of its greatest offspring - that master thought of the nineteenth century the idea of Evolution. This idea, more perhaps than any other scientific conception, has had most influence on modern thought ; it, more than anything else, has altered man's outlook on life. The reason is obvious - it revolutionised men's conception of life, and their chief interest, whether scientist, poet, or philosopher, must necessarily be life. It meant the substitution of a dynamic for a static conception of the Universe; it meant the replace- ment of the idea of a product by the idea of a process. The idea itself is by no means the exclusive property of science; on the contrary, the earliest, widest, and most satisfactory expression of it was given in philosophy. Nevertheless, the idea would not have had a tithe of the influence it now possesses if it had not been put on a firm scientific foundation by Darwin and his successors. It is really very difficult for us to realise fully the whole effect of Evolution on modern thought ; we are so used to the idea, having grown up, as it were, in its shadow, that it has</page><page sequence="12">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 749 almost become a part of our mental constitution ; it has become one of the presuppositions which the human mind carries with it in its onward march. We can scarcely imagine the intel- lectual outlook of people, including the poets, who lived before the inception of this idea. We have to imagine an intellectual atmosphere in which the law of the uniformity of Nature and the law of universal causation were only accepted to a very limited degree. Law itself was hardly more than partially recognised. Theories of the special creation of species held general sway, and immutability, rather than mutability, was regarded as their main characteristic. In man the idea of development, of social and intellectual progress, was of academic rather than of practical interest. Many, indeed, believed that retrogression had set in ; that the highest attainment of humanity had occurred in some Golden Age of the past. If there was any social progress at all it was looked upon as the result of an artificial social machinery ; the idea that that social machinery itself was the result of a natural development of the race was only dimly perceived, if at all. Evolution changed all this. Society must be regarded as continuous from age to age - it is an organism, not a manufacture. The idea of the individual being " the heir of all the ages " was seen to be merely the expression of a fact. Moreover, the philosophy of development is essentially a hopeful one - it finds for a large amount of pain and evil a place and a significance more satis- factory to the reason than most of the arbitrary theological explanations of previous generations, and affords a natural incentive to moral effort. Of all modern poets Tennyson was the one who perhaps made most use of this conception,1 though all were under its influence. In fact Tennyson's principal point of contact with science was his acceptance of evolution as a fact. All his philoso- phical and nature poetry is written from this point of view. His most emphatic references to evolution are in the two poems Locksley Hall and its sequel. In Maud too we find it - He (man) felt himself in his force to be Nature's crowning race. As nine months go to the shaping an infant ripe for his birth, So many a million of ages have gone for the making of man ; He now is first, but is he the last? is he not too base? 1 For a more extended treatment of this part of the subject see Mr. Master- man's book on Tennyson, to which I must acknowledge my indebtedness.</page><page sequence="13">75° SCIENCE PROGRESS And again in The Princess : This world was once a fluid haze of light, Till toward the centre set the starry tides, And eddied into suns, that wheeling cast The planets : then the monster, then the man ; Tattoo'd or woaded, winter-clad in skins, Raw from the prime, and crushing down his mate ; As yet we find in barbarous isles, and here Among the lowest. This evolutionary faith runs all through Tennyson's works ; In Memoriam is permeated with it. In one part of this poem he speaks of the succession of types in Nature and speaks of a gradual development from age to age, man being but an intermediate link in the chain of progress to higher and higher types : Star and system rolling past, A soul shall draw from out the vast And strike his being into bounds, And, moved thro' life of lower phase, Result in man, be born and think, And act and love, a closer link Betwixt us and the crowning race Of those that, eye to eye, shall look On knowledge ; under whose command Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand' Is Nature like an open book ; No longer half-akin to brute, For all we thought and loved and did, And hoped and suffered is but seed Of what in them is flower and fruit. It is significant that though this was written before the Origin of Species was published, the ideas expressed are practically identical with those in Prof. Ray Lankester's Romanes Lecture on "Nature and Man" - the latest word that science has yet said on man's position in the Universe. After the appearance of the Origin Tennyson's grasp of the principle of Evolution became much firmer. Henceforth two main points in the theory seem to have struck him with special force. One was the slowness of the change combined with the fact that though slow there seems to be no logical limit to its power;</page><page sequence="14">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 751 so that man may develop into something much higher than he is- Man as yet is being made, and ere the crowning Age of ages, Shall not aeon after aeon pass and touch him into shape. Or, on the other hand, he may pass away altogether : Many an ason moulded earth before her highest, Man, was born, Many an aeon too may pass when earth is manless and forlorn. The other point that seems to have struck Tennyson was the possibility of a reversion. This becomes much more marked in his later poems in which he looks back on life; they are naturally less optimistic than the earlier ones. In the earlier poems he regards man as being an intermediate link in a chain of an ever-progressing development. Later he is less confident, and his lack of confidence is due to his wider experience and completer knowledge of the complex relationships of life. In Locksley Hall, Sixty Years After , we find this conception of reversion quite clearly stated : Evolution ever climbing after some ideal good, And Reversion ever dragging Evolution in the mud. He then goes on and gives the idea in its full significance : All the full-brain, half-brain races, led by Justice, Love, and Truth ; All the millions one at length, with all the visions of my youth? All diseases quench'd by Science, no man halt, or deaf, or blind ; Stronger ever born of weaker, lustier body, larger mind ? Earth at last a warless world, a single race, a single tongue - I have seen her far away - for is not Earth as yet so young? Every tiger madness-muzzled, every serpent passion-killed, Every grim ravine a garden, every blazing desert tilFd, Robed in universal harvest up to either pole she smiles, Universal ocean softly washing all her warless isles. Warless ? when her tens are thousands, and her thousands millions, then - All her harvests all too narrow-who can fancy warless men ? Warless? war will die out late then. Will it ever? late or soon? Can it, till this outworn Earth be dead as yon dead world the moon? And this reversion, he fears, has even now set in, for he continues - Is it well that while we range with Science, glorying in the Time, City children soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime? „</page><page sequence="15">752 SCIENCE PROGRESS There among the gloomy alleys Progress halts on palsied feet, Crime and hunger cast our maidens by the thousand on the street. There the master scrimps his haggard sempstress of her daily bread, There a single sordid attic holds the living and the dead. There the smouldering fire of fever creeps across the rotted floor, And the crowded couch of incest in the warrens of the poor. And yet in spite of all this he realises that it is a possibility only and no more, and that we are really quite ignorant as to the future - Far away beyond her myriad coming changes Earth will be Something other than the wildest modern guess of you and me. Earth may reach her earthly-worst, or if she gain her earthly-best, Would she find her human offspring this ideal man at rest? On the whole, however, he agrees that Evolution instils hope into the human heart ; his last word is one of exhortation, and he ends the poem by pointing out the necessity of hoping and striving : Follow you the star that lights a desert pathway, yours or mine, Forward, till you see the highest Human -Nature is divine. Follow Light, and do the Right - for man can half-control his doom - Till you find the deathless Angel seated in the vacant tomb. Forward, let the stormy moment fly and mingle with the Past. I that loathed have come to love him. Love will conquer at the last. Tennyson, as we have seen, kept pace with the advances of modern thought. He of all the poets made most use of the results arrived at by modern science without making his work at all prosaic, or anything other than the highest and the best. It is, in fact, this advance of Tennyson in keeping pace with the strides of modern science and modern thought that makes him the best example one can offer of the influence of science on poetry; from an examination of his work we can trace the development of his mind with increasing years and that know- ledge, wider experience, and fuller understanding that advancing years alone can bring. It has been said that Browning had a firmer grasp of the principle of Evolution, and that the science and philosophy of the time probably made a deeper impression on him than it did on Tennyson. Be this as it may, £oy rate it is less apparent,</page><page sequence="16">SCIENCE AND MODERN POETRY 753 for Browning never advanced beyond the position taken up in his first really great poem, Paracelsus , which he published at the age of twenty-three. It is remarkable that although this poem was written a quarter of a century before Darwin's Origin was published, yet it contains what is perhaps one of the most precise, complete and satisfactory expressions of the principle of Evolution that has ever been put forward. As far as regards his position towards this theory and towards contemporary thought in general, his mind was as fully developed at this time as it was in any of his later poems, and his whole conception of the Universe was ruled by this one idea. Thus at the close of the poem, the speaker Paracelsus shows how God is immanent in all Nature and how finally all leads up to man ; and yet how " man is not Man as yet," but must develop into something far higher and nobler. The whole poem is wonderfully conceived and still more wonderfully expressed ; it is one of the wonders of the English language ; one of those precious things of litera- ture that humanity cannot afford to be without. It is also interesting from another point of view. It shows us that Browning arrived at the conception of evolution, not from science alone, but from the whole of contemporary thought, whereas Tennyson arrived at it mainly from the scientific side. It points out to us exactly the nature of any influence that science may have had on modern poetry. Science is not an extraneous thing which casts a halo, like some divine effulgence, over everything that comes within its influence. It is merely a mode of thought. It is one of the forms in which thought expresses itself. Philosophy is another, and so also to a large extent are poetry and art. All these are merely expressions of thought ; merely forms in which is expressed man's outlook on life and on the Universe. As such they are bound to influence each other, to overlap, as it were, and collectively they represent that " spirit of the age " which we are so prone to objectify and make the standard by which we judge and are judged, and by which, to use Hegel's phrase, we " re-evaluate all values " as human exigencies demand. This "spirit of the age," which is thus in reality but another name for modern thought, is itself a product of the human mind - like science, poetry, and art - and must therefore change with progress. This brings one naturally to the idea of the relativity of human knowledge and the impossibility of setting up absolute standards. This</page><page sequence="17">754 SCIENCE PROGRESS conception is a product of evolutionary science, in fact it follows from it as a necessary corollary and is perhaps the latest scientific idea that is old enough to have influenced poetry in any definite manner. The more one thinks about it the more is one convinced that the scientific movement must necessarily from its very nature have had a profound and lasting influence on modern poetry. In tracing such influence one can only generalise, pointing out tendencies and directions that the thoughts of men - poets in particular - have taken. The real meeting-point of the poet and the scientist is in the imagination and the emotions of men. We have too long been accustomed to regard these as being the exclusive happy hunting ground of the poet and as being but a sterile desert to the scientific investi- gator except in so far as he regards them objectively as parts of that Nature which it is his function to study. This, in fact, was the feeling in the materialistic philosophy of last century, but it has happily given place to another. Science can play on the imagination and emotions of men to an extent scarcely inferior to that of poetry, and it is only by so doing that science can become and remain a living thing and of real and lasting interest to mankind.</page></plain_text>
