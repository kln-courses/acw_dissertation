Eight of the ten essays gathered in this collection have been published else- where between 1961 and 1966. Although arranged in three sections, one on the Turner-Beard hypotheses about the class origins of the Revolution and</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 707 Constitution, the second on slavery and the Constitution, the third on the origins of Jeffersonianism, they are connected by Lynd's concern to give a sympathetic reconstruction of Beard's theories, and to provide an adequate New Left view of the meaning of the Revolution and Constitution. There is in this attempt an appreciative, although critical, homage to Progressivism, which for Lynd was morally culpable and wrong in its conclusions, but at least it had an advanced vision of the meaning of American history. Lynd's manner of argument is agreeably modest, and his assertions are made clearly and with a perspective on the larger issues that is usually well in view. But he is ringing changes on old bells on which countless changes have previously been rung; his do not seem new or very startling or, for that matter, of a decisive superiority. Lynd's arguments can be listed very simply: (1) The class interests of the American Revolution do not line up along rebel-loyalist lines; witness Dutchess County, New York, where the tenants were loyalists and the aristocratic land- lords were on the side of the Revolution. The American Revolution was not, therefore, a social revolution. (2) The coincidence of the slavery provisions in the Constitution and Northwest Ordinance suggests that there was a compromise by which Northern and Southern personalty and realty interests were brought to a common sup- port of the Constitution. The Constitution was therefore a "triumph" of prop- erty of all kinds. (3) Turner's frontiersman was usually a slave-owning planter; Jeffersonian and Jacksonian democracy was a continuation of the eighteenth-century Tory ideology conveniently labeled Whig by Franklin in the 1760's to make it more palatable. There was therefore no social revolution under Jefferson or Jackson. (4) America's lower classes were the slaves and certain (never identified) free poor left behind by the development of the country. Most of the working classes, including common labor, were not poor and therefore not a class with interests opposed to property most of the time. The mechanics or even the working class generally were not potentially revolutionary. Lynd's study of the tenant rebellions in Dutchess County, New York, is used to show that the Revolution was not a social revolution. Doubtless this is true, yet Dutchess County is a peculiar place from which to make generaliza- tion, since land tenure patterns that were unknown elsewhere in the colonies were just beginning to break down there. Other material should have been brought into Mr. Lynd's argument at this point. If the Revolution was not a social revolution, Lynd would have us believe that there still was one. But when? Not under Jefferson, because Jeffersonians, as slaveholders, were really property-owning opponents of central government in the tradition of early eighteenth-century English Tories. Under Jackson? No, because Jackson was a party to the removal of the Cherokees from Georgia and was a "representative" of the plantation aristocracy rather than of democracy, the frontier, or the Eastern workingman. The real revolution came with the Civil War and the "triumph of capitalism" over a landed aristocracy. Jefferson and Jackson represent merely the breaking up of the property coalition that made the Constitution. Thus America's revolutions</page><page sequence="3">708 Reviews of Books were either coalitions for independence or counterrevolutions-counting the Constitution and the Civil War as counterrevolutions and the periods of Jef- ferson and Jackson not at all. That industrial capitalism "triumphed" is a fact; that there was a dialectic with Southern slaveowners is not a fact or a reasonable interpretation. There is in economic interest no reason that the two could not have existed side by side until present times just as share- cropping and a certain amount of subsistence agriculture have existed without culminating in a civil war. If the "real" revolution were over slavery, it is strange that a stronger case could not be made from the Records of the Convention. Lynd draws back from insisting that a "deal" was made on the evening of July 11, 1787, or that Hamilton, fresh from New York, was the one who worked it out, but Lynd organizes all his arguments to point to this (not original) conclusion. Until he is more convincing, I will continue to believe that slavery was but one of the issues between Northern and Southern, large and small, and agricultural and trading states in the Convention. Race questions are assuredly important to our present-day national life, but the fact that the New Left can only find dialectic in early American society on the slavery question does not justify a new anthropomorphic reading of the past. History is little advanced when we must understand Beard's and Lynd's politics in order to understand history. The printing is by a modem process that consistently uses defective letters, and the editing is not of the highest order. But Mr. Lynd writes well and engages the reader's interest, even though he might have recast these essays into a more effective, less repetitious book.
