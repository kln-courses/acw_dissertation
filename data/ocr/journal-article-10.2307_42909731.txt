<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joyce and Contesting Priesthoods in Suttree and Blood Meridian Farrell O 'Gorman Robert Coles' 1974 characterization of Cormac McCarthy as "a novelist of religious feeling who appears to subscribe to no creed but who cannot stop wondering in the most passionate and honest way what gives life meaning" still rings true today (90). Unlike writers such as Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy, McCarthy has refused to elaborate on his religious views in lectures, essays, or interviews, and for many readers the great appeal of his fiction lies partly in the fact that it continually and brilliantly rearticulates religious questions without giving clear answers to them. But we do know for certain at least two facts that can help to illuminate the religious imagery so prevalent in his work, as well as its deeper dimensions. We know that he comes out of a Roman Catholic background which he apparently struggled to reject as a young man.1 And we know that in McCarthy's view, "books are made out of books. The novel depends for its life upon the novels that have been written," so that we might well seek to understand the religious dimensions of his work in terms of intertextuality (quoted in Woodward). When McCarthy made that remark in 1992, he listed Faulkner, Dostoevsky, and Melville among his own favored literary ancestors. But the novel that marks the culmination of his earlier work owes more, I believe, to three different authors: radically original as Suttree is, it reads in part like a strange conflation of Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , O'Connor's Wise Blood , and Joyce's Ulysses. My concern here is with the last novel, which has 123</page><page sequence="2">often been mentioned as an obvious influence on Suttree but not much elaborated upon in that regard. I will not argue that McCarthy's novel is derivative of Joyce's in any reductive sense, but rather that reading Joyce's two novels of Stephen Dedalus - A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses - alongside the two novels at the heart of McCarthy's oeuvre, Suttree and Blood Meridian , can help us to better understand what Edwin Arnold has called the "mosaic" of McCarthy's fiction (1). My reading - both intertextual and intratextual - focuses specifically on the figure of the priest in all four novels and speculates more generally on McCarthy's own quasi- Joycean identity as an apparently "defrocked" Catholic of Irish- American background (, Suttree 191). My thesis depends largely upon Stephen Dedalus' identification of himself as a "priest of eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life" {Portrait 221). Read sequentially, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses depict this aspiring priest of art in initial conflict with an oppressive Catholic priesthood but ultimately threatened by the naturalistic ideology of an eloquent "priest of the body," the playful but sinister medical student Buck Mulligan (Boyle 29).2 Similarly, McCarthy's Suttree and Blood Meridian depict first the artist-figure Suttree' s rejection of a seemingly "catatonic" Catholic priesthood, but subsequently a world wherein the Mulliganesque Judge stands in dominant opposition to art and to Christian tradition alike - represented in part by the Kid, who might be read as an impotent artist, and by the expriest Tobin. 124</page><page sequence="3">I. Suttree and Joyce: Or, Portraits of the Artist as Prodigal Catholic Schoolboy Others have made the case that Cornelius Suttree is an aspiring artist. William Prather has briefly suggested that Suttree is "to some extent a Kunstlerroman , chronicling the struggles and growth of an absurd artist" (15 In. ); John Vanderheide has more specifically examined Suttree and Blood Meridian in light of their common concern with "prodigal sons" whose roundabout searches for their fathers invoke "versions" of that search "deployed by some of McCarthy's modernist precursors ...who treated this theme not as a religious allegory, but as an allegory of writing and authorship" (177). Vanderheide specifically mentions Joyce's "prodigal" artist Stephen Dedalus, though he chooses to deemphasize the overtly theological dimensions of Stephen's (and Suttree 's, and the Kid's) roundabout quest for the father. But I think Vereen Bell is more accurate in his passing observation that Suttree' s protagonist is, "like Stephen Dedalus, an imperfectly lapsed Catholic, left impaled upon the wrong end of a coherent theological dogma in which the world can only be a place of death and suffering" (69). We must, I contend, understand this before we can fully understand Suttree' s artistic aspirations. Indeed, Suttree' s identity as a "defrocked" Catholic who views himself as a rebellious or failed priest is more readily apparent and pervasive than are his artistic aspirations (191). To begin with, we know that Suttree, like Dedalus, was once devout, spending "a thousand hours or more" in the Church of the Immaculate Conception, where "the virtues of a stainless birth were not lost on him, no not on him"; there, in classic pre- Vatican II Catholic fashion, he spent "so many black Fridays in terror of his sins. Viceridden child, heart 125</page><page sequence="4">rotten with fear" (253). Like Stephen Dedalus - who turns to prostitutes midway through Portrait and who has been drinking and whoring in Paris and then Dublin at the beginning of Ulysses - Suttree has indeed taken a radical prodigal turn from his inherited religious tradition. But both remain inevitably self-conscious regarding their earlier Catholic identity, Stephen in his Thomistic artistic theories, Suttree more existentially so. Stephen's friend Cranly tells him that "your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve," an observation that applies to Suttree as well (240). For example, after being coerced into a debauch with Reese, Suttree tells him woefully, "you would absolutely pull the pope under" (345); in the aftermath of Wanda's death he perceives her suffering mother as "an image of baroque pieta" (362).3 But Stephen Dedalus struggles specifically with an invitation to enter the priesthood; Suttree does not. So in what sense is Suttree a priest or a potential priest? If we recognize what J. Douglas Canfield and Thomas Young have briefly described as the rich "Christology" of Suttree , and we consider the priest as a surrogate Christ, the novel may indeed go further in its priesthood theme than does Joyce's (Canfield, 683 passim ; Young, 120).4 For Suttree himself is - problematically but insistently - a sort of stand-in for Christ in the novel. The son of a woman named Grace, he prefers the company of poor fishermen, criminals, and prostitutes to that of the apparently righteous. Two women mistake him for a holy bridegroom: his wife, we are told, "had taken [this derelict] for the son of light himself' (150), and Wanda accepts her first intimation of coming intimacy with Suttree as reverently as Mary accepted hers at the Annunciation. Told by Reese at the dinner table that she and 126</page><page sequence="5">Suttree will be alone together on a boat, "She did not look up. She seemed to be at grace" (349). Insofar as a priest is supposed to function as a surrogate for Christ (or other persons of the Trinity), then, Suttree seems to play that role, however poorly or ironically, and on occasion he may even envision himself as a Catholic priest. Towards the end of Suttree' s first major drinking binge, passed out in his own vomit, "a dream of shriving came to him. He knelt on the cold stone flags at the chancel gate where the winey light of votive candles cast his querulous shadow behind him. He bent in tears until his forehead touched the stone" (78). The image here is obviously that of a penitent Suttree in church; but in modern English shrive is a transitive verb. Is Suttree dreaming not of confessing - or not merely of confessing - but of hearing a confession, even if it is that of his own "querulous shadow"? Several actual Catholic priests appear in the novel. Suttree' s memory of anonymous priests from his childhood, "grim and tireless in their orthopedic moralizing," "filled with tales of sin and unrepentant deaths and visions of hell and stories of lévitation and possession and dogmas of Semitic damnation for the tacking up of the paraclete," suggests a repressive clergy akin to that which intermittently terrifies the young Stephen Dedalus in Portrait (254). Otherwise, however, the individual priests who appear in the novel all seem rather mild-mannered compared to the fiery evangelical preachers Suttree also encounters; but all are rebuffed by him nonetheless, as in the case of the gentle priest who wakes him and smiles "sadly, but a smile for that" when Suttree leaves the Church of the Immaculate Conception (255). The most significant priest - certainly the most frightening priest - is the one who does not speak. This 127</page><page sequence="6">mysterious figure, whom Suttree encounters in the ruins of his old schoolhouse, emerges in a doorway like an apparition and proceeds to watch Suttree "like a piece of statuary. A catatonic shaman who spoke no word at all." Leaving the schoolhouse, Suttree looks back to see "the shape of the priest in the baywindow watching like a paper priest in a pulpit or a prophet sealed in glass" (305). Now, Suttree himself, staying at Mrs. Long' s house at this point in the novel, has been spending his nights leaning "in the octagonal windowbay and look[ing] out over the switching yards and the warehouses like a child in a pulpit in the dark of an empty church" (304). Given this juxtaposition it seems that the silent priest Suttree encounters in the schoolhouse is in fact himself - a twinned image like those that abound throughout the novel, corresponding to his own dead twin and/or to some other potential self, some "doublegoer" or "othersuttree" such as he sensed during his trek through the mountains in the preceding chapter (2 8 7). 5 In that chapter and elsewhere in the novel, Suttree seeks some pagan counterpoint to the "Christian witchcraft" was taught in his Catholic school (304). As William Spencer has demonstrated, in the mountains Suttree engages in a version of the Native American vision quest, acting as a different kind of priest, one who administers his own pagan "sacrament" to himself (106). The nominally Saxon Suttree has been prepared for this priesthood by the "old distaff Celt's blood in some back chamber of his brain [which] moved him to discourse with the birches, with the oaks" (286). Suttree as druid-priest would seem to owe more to Yeats than to Joyce, and Barbara Brickman has documented McCarthy's familiarity with the Irish mythology that Yeats valued so highly; but it is more in keeping with Joyce's ultimately critical portrayal of his priest, Stephen Dedalus, 128</page><page sequence="7">that McCarthy shows Suttree continually tending to fail as priest, whether Catholic or pagan. This tendency is clearly demonstrated in Suttree' s role as reluctant fisherman. In the novel's opening chapter, on a Sunday morning, Suttree "said that he might have been a fisher of men in another time but these fish now seemed task enough for him" (14).6 This statement obviously suggests that Suttree will not be concerning himself with winning converts by preaching the Gospel. But, given that in the early Church the fish was a symbol of the Eucharist and of Christ himself, it also suggests Suttree' s priestly role with regard to the fish: he prepares them for consumption by gutting them, just as the priest breaking the bread during the Catholic liturgy reenacts the violence inflicted upon the body of Christ even as he prepares the eucharistie feast. Suttree wishes to strip his actions of such Christian resonance, of course, and given his interaction with the Indian Michael as well as his later vision quest we might think he is seeking to embrace the myth of the sacred hunter, wherein the hunter functions as a priest who reveres his prey (as with the young Ike McCaslin in Faulkner's Go Down, Moses or the veteran Nick Adams in Hemingway's "Big Two-Hearted River"). But Suttree never becomes such a hunter-priest in the course of the novel. He shows little reverence for the fish he kills, and when it comes to consuming this eucharist of the wilderness - well, he doesn't "much like fish" himself (205). Several critics have noted his failure to fully emulate the Indian Michael, and Spencer notes that even the later vision quest, while successful in some respects, seems to result in only limited growth for Suttree (106). So: in this tentative pagan priesthood Suttree has perhaps sought to forget the Christian God and reconcile himself to nature alone, but at novel's end he has done neither. The hounds and huntsman 129</page><page sequence="8">who pursue him are still present and they, whether representative of some grim Jehovah or of "mere" nature itself, will inevitably track him down and leave him dead like the "flayed man with his brisket tacked open ...and his skull peeled" that he imagined much earlier in the novel - they will leave him "like a cooling beef," gutted like the fish he himself has killed (86). Clearly, what Suttree has to confront that Stephen Dedalus does not so directly in his more overt quest for artistic priesthood is nature itself. In Portrait , at least, Stephen merely seeks to "fly by" the nets of "nationality, language, religion" that he fears his country has thrown around his soul (203); Suttree, arguably, seeks to fly by those nets as well, but he is more insistently defined by his felt need to "fly" by the inevitable trap of death itself, whether mandated by a cruel anthropomorphic God (the huntsman?) or a predatory Nature (the hounds?) (471). Nonetheless, the similarities between the two figures are apparent. Much as Dedalus refuses the call of the Jesuits to instead seek his vocation as a priest of art, Suttree repeatedly walks away from Catholic priests whom he fears might impose upon him some false notion of "God's house" and thereby of reality itself (254). Denying traditional religious beliefs, each ultimately finds his struggle to become an artist complicated by confrontation with death. At the beginning of Ulysses the novice poet Stephen is paralyzed by the death of his mother, while Suttree' s more general obsession with death - heightened if we note the "complicity of narrator and protagonist" in Suttree - might be said to necessarily define whatever artistic vision he might achieve (Prather 15 In.; see also Vanderheide 179). II. Blood Meridian and Joyce: Or, Stately, Plump Buck Mulligan Takes a Scalp 130</page><page sequence="9">Suttree is about a group of people living beyond the "pale" who are inevitably crushed or displaced by an advancing civilization of dubious comparative value, much as the "teutonic" settlers of the New World, "abrogate Semitic chapbook" firmly in hand, displaced Native Americans - and much as Anglo-Saxon invaders, most notably the Puritan Oliver Cromwell, displaced pagan- cum- Catholic Celts beyond the Pale in Ireland (4). The same patterns are obviously at the heart of Blood Meridian , which Nick Monk has rightly identified as most fully embodying McCarthy's "devastating critique" of a "modernity that owes its existence to the European Enlightenment" (83). Monk suggests such a critique exists "within the subtexts" of all of McCarthy's work, and indeed Suttree prefigures the Catholic and eucharistie imagery of McCarthy's first Western novel in a manner that helps to illuminate that critique. Suttree is haunted by memories of his childhood church with its "garish altars," of himself kneeling "before this tabernacle where the wise high God himself lies sleeping in his golden cup" (253); in Blood Meridian , the kid enters a church where "the altars had been hauled down and the tabernacle looted and the great sleeping God of the Mexicans routed from his golden cup." In this same church in Blood Meridian "a dead Christ in a glass bier lay broken in the chancel floor" (60). In the earlier novel, Suttree dreams of his twin, "a dead child in a glass bier" (80); he visits Turner's stall where he sees dead fish, including Michael's monstrous catfish, displayed on ice in "a long glass bier" (220); and, again, he encounters or envisions the silent priest in the window "like a prophet sealed in glass" (305), yet a third image that prefigures the "dead Christ in a glass bier" in Blood Meridian. 131</page><page sequence="10">The landscape of Blood Meridian is littered with mined churches, and the images cited above are among the earliest suggestions that the ruler of that landscape, Judge Holden, is not only the "supreme avatar" of European Enlightenment but also a thoroughgoing iconoclast in the manner of Cromwell, whose troops ravaged the Irish landscape and sacked Catholic churches in the seventeenth century. By portraying Holden in this light McCarthy might seem to be following the example of the Mexican War's San Patricio Battalion, composed of Irish-American conscripts who switched sides and began fighting for Mexico when they witnessed and experienced anti-Catholic bias on the part of the U.S. Army - a bias which inevitably carried racial overtones concerning Anglo-Saxon superiority as well (McCaffrey 71-5, 113). But McCarthy's concerns here are, as always, not merely historical or political. All of the images identified above have a more strictly religious, or ontological, significance as well, suggesting not only the apparent inefficacy of Christ's death but also the inevitable horror implicit in a Darwinian natural world where the only "eucharist" seems to be that which the Kid finds in the ruined church: "the scalped and naked and partly eaten bodies of some forty souls" who "lay in a great pool of their communal blood" (60). There are, to be sure, other intratextual connections to be made between the two novels, but these best prepare us to examine the continuation of the theme of priesthood in Blood Meridian in relation to Joyce's second novel of Stephen Dedalus. The first episode of Ulysses (set against the backdrop of Dublin Bay, wherein a boat searches for a drowned man, as in the Tennessee River at the opening of Suttree) clearly establishes the rivalry between Stephen and his roommate, the medical student Buck Mulligan, in terms 132</page><page sequence="11">of contesting priesthoods. The novel opens with Mulligan performing an elaborate parody of the Mass as he goes about his morning ritual of shaving - i.e., tending to his body. He summons Stephen, whom he deems a "fearful jesuit," specifically to witness his mocking of the Eucharist. Holding aloft his shaving bowl, Mulligan proclaims, "in a preacher's tone": "For this, О dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles" (3). Mulligan's undercutting of the doctrine of transubstantiation with the language of modern biology here establishes the most significant aspect of his identity throughout the rest of the novel. He consistently appears as the priest of the body, preaching that material reality is the only reality and accordingly mocking not only Stephen's former mentors - Catholic priests - but also Stephen's current aspirations to become a "priest of the eternal imagination," a priest of art. Mulligan's mockery is particularly threatening to Stephen because in Ulysses he has been forced to confront the body - nature, mortality - in a way that he did not in Portrait. Here, Stephen's mother has recently died; she returns to haunt him as a ghoulish corpse at points throughout the novel, and Stephen when looking at seemingly innocuous natural scenes like "the ring of bay and skyline" fronting his Dublin residence sees instead the "bowl of white china [that] had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting" (5). Such images might well remind us of Suttree , and like Suttree Stephen cannot, despite his professedly atheological bent, accept the death of loved ones dispassionately: of his mother's natural death he says, gloomily, "Someone killed her" (5). 7 His inability to pray at 133</page><page sequence="12">his mother's deathbed after she had asked him to is a subject of revealing conversation with Mulligan, who tells Stephen he might as well have pretended to pray because "it simply doesn't matter" one way or the other. In his longest speech of the novel, Mulligan goes on to say: "And what is death... your mother's or yours or my own? You only saw your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the [hospital] and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter.... To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning" (7). The powerful naturalistic ideology that Mulligan articulates here indicates how Stephen's challenges have changed since Portrait. Having attempted to escape his seemingly oppressive religious tradition, he nonetheless has become discouraged about life as well as the possibilities of art. In this initial episode Stephen says "with grim displeasure": "You behold in me. . . a horrible example of free thought" - a self-condemning remark that might also call Suttree to mind, as in his recognition that "my life is ghastly" ( Ulysses 17; Suttree 348). In the modernist moment of Ulysses Stephen has, perhaps, become less Romantic and more existential. In any case, his most threatening nemesis is no longer the Catholic priest - generally foolish and impotent here, much as in Suttree - but rather the dark priest Mulligan, who is identified in the last word of the episode as a "usurper." And indeed Mulligan, whose narrowly conceived science has usurped the high place Western culture once assigned to religion and art, seems to dominate the twentieth- century world Stephen must confront in Ulysses much as the Judge dominates the world of Blood Meridian. Mulligan does generally operate in a more forthrightly comic mode than 134</page><page sequence="13">McCarthy's Judge, who is initially amusing only to become increasingly threatening over the course of Blood Meridian. Nonetheless, the fundamental similarities are there, at least one of which is suggested at the end of the first episode. Mulligan, reminding Dedalus that the young artist is financially indebted to the medical student, openly affiliates himself with Nietzsche: "I'm the Ubermensch ," Mulligan proclaims. "He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake Zarasthusra" (19). Mulligan in fact has a number of attributes which seem to be reflected in the character of the Judge. Mulligan is physically imposing - "Stately, plump," and "wellfed" as well as clean-shaven (3, 5). His identity as a scientist is developed further in the "Oxen of the Sun" episode, which takes places at a maternity hospital where Mulligan is identified as having a special interest in hygiene and eugenics (341). One of his "disciples," a medical student named Lynch, comments on infant mortality as "an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless... in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest," for "Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does" (342). Mulligan's endorsement of this view is consistent with his general tendency to speak as an advocate of Nature and of "Hellenic" values as opposed to Judeo-Christian values (e.g., he speaks of the sea as "our great sweet mother," reads ancient Greek [4-5]). But despite his occasional forays into such high-minded discourse and the fact that he is a minor poet of sorts himself, Mulligan functions most consistently as a depriver of meaning, a mocker both of theology and of the serious art that Stephen aspires to; in the "Scylla and Charybdis" episode, for example, he relentlessly mocks 135</page><page sequence="14">Stephen's attempts to interpret Hamlet in light of Thomas Aquinas. This Satanic aspect of Mulligan's character is further developed when he is apparently aided by demonic spirits at points in the novel, beginning with the strange suspension of his nightgown during his opening parody of the Mass and culminating with Stephen's vision of him, in the expressionistic "Circe" episode, as the celebrant of a Black Mass (488-9; see Robert H. Bell, 366). In all of these respects Mulligan resembles Blood Meridian's Judge, a "scientist" who similarly preaches the crude naturalism best encapsulated in his statement: "the mystery is that there is no mystery" (252). Just as Mulligan is introduced via his parody of the Mass, the Judge is introduced making a mockery of the Reverend Green, the preacher whom he deprives of meaning and whose place he effectively usurps in Chapter I. Like Mulligan, the Judge - who is not only clean-shaven but hairless - values hygiene: early in Blood Meridian he is depicted cleaning himself, "routing small life from the folds of his hairless skin," throwing an insect into the fire in what "appeared to be a benediction" (93). And obviously there is a eugenic aspect to his suggestions that humans should "cull" themselves like wolves, not to mention his general views on race (146). He, too, speaks as a supposed advocate of Nature and of classical - not New Testament - values, well read in "certain passages from the Greek poets" and "declaiming in the old epic mode" himself at least once (84-5, 118). And he clearly functions as a dark priest, most obviously in his role in Chapter X as a false Christ who "saves" twelve scalphunters and as celebrant of a Black Mass that yields not the Christian Eucharist but instead gunpowder (Spurgeon 87-8). In Chapter XVIII - an apparent rewriting of Flannery O'Connor's story "The River" - the Judge perverts yet another sacrament via 136</page><page sequence="15">his reverse baptism of the Idiot; he is later described walking atop the Yuma ferry fortifications "wrapped in a mantle of freeflowing cloth," "like some great balden archimandrite," or abbot (273). And so on. None of this is to deny that the Judge is McCarthy's own unforgettably original creation - though he is also, to adapt a line from The Crossing , a dog who looks like he's been made out of other dogs (423). He is not entirely derivative of Joyce's Mulligan any more than he is entirely derivative of Melville's Ahab or Melville's Whale or the Old Testament Jehovah. But it is Mulligan, I believe, who can best help us to understand the Judge's identity as an essentially modern priest of naturalism, a mocking poet, and a sinister clown: horrifying as he is, the Judge - like Mulligan - is, at least initially, much funnier than Ahab or the Whale or Jehovah. Just as Stephen, the priest of eternal imagination, attempts to resist the priest of the body, so too do the Kid and Tobin attempt to counter the Judge as priest-figures. The Kid - a version of the Suttree who fled west from Knoxville, perhaps, albeit an inarticulate one - is not clearly a priest of art; only by inference, as regarding his near-visionary experiences in Chapter XV, can we surmise that he is supposed to be a Dedalus, or, better, an Ishmael. But unlike Melville's Ishmael, he does not survive to tell his tale. He is destroyed much as works of art themselves are destroyed throughout Blood Meridian , from the handsomely engraved shotgun Brown saws off in San Diego (265-8) to the Native American artifacts destroyed by the Judge (140 et. al.) to the "array of saints in their niches... shot up by American troops trying their rifles" at the novel's beginning - including the "carved stone Virgin" and "headless child" that foreshadow the ultimate fate of the Kid himself (26-7). Here art and the 137</page><page sequence="16">silent priest of art alike fall under the dominant sway of the violent, usurping, and relentlessly iconoclastic Judge. The lapsed Catholic priest Tobin, an Irishman who by his own account "was never a priest but only a novitiate to the order," likewise seems to remain under the sway of the Judge throughout the novel itself (250). But it is possible to ultimately associate Tobin with the mysterious man of the epilogue, a figure who seems to stands in successful opposition to the Judge and who - as Leo Daugherty has argued - may represent McCarthy himself. Though Tobin seems simply to disappear from the narrative, a careful reading suggests more. He is last described setting off in search of a doctor for himself and the Kid - which might seem to suggest his ultimate capitulation to the Judge's modern ideology, his all-encompassing faith in not simply science but a utilitarian science practiced for the sake of expanding human power over nature (303). Just prior to this disappearance, however, the expriest is depicted apparently lapsing back into some form of Christian belief, wandering through a field of bones and attempting to resist the Judge by "holding aloft a cross he'd fashioned out of the shins of a ram," "holding the thing before him like some mad dowser in the bleak of desert" (289-90). Given that a dowser is one who uses a divining rod, this image clearly prefigures the epilogue, wherein a man holds an "implement with two handles" and makes his way across a "plain" or "prairie," a landscape presumably more fertile than the desert; behind him are "the bones and the gatherers of bones and those who do not gather" (337). Though the bones here have any number of antecedents within the novel, if we read the epilogue with Tobin in mind they may well refer not only to the exorcism scene described above but also to the scattered bones of the long dead Christ-figure the Judge has described 138</page><page sequence="17">in his perverse parable in Chapter XI (143-5). Some seek his "bones," and some do not, but he seems effectively dead in the landscape of the post-Enlightenment West - which the man of the epilogue leaves behind for greener ground that might call to mind the Reverend Green usurped by the Judge in Chapter I. This reading, I think, complements Leo Daugherty's suggestion that the man of the epilogue is McCarthy himself, both carrying "the romantic conception of the artist-as-creator/progenitor...to a new apotheosis" and presenting himself as a kind of Gnostic priest (170). And if he is Tobin-cwm-McCarthy, then in Joycean terms he is the expriest successfully transformed into priest of art, wielding not the cross but, as Daugherty would have it, a typewriter. But insofar as McCarthy strives to be such a priest he, like Joyce, finally does so not by utterly rejecting the vision of the third priest - the priest of the body - but by seeking to incorporate that vision within his own. Robert Bell has convincingly argued that despite Joyce's own seeming disavowal of Mulligan, "the relationship between Joyce and Buck is much closer" than it might first appear; accordingly, the narrative of Ulysses finally seems to owe as much to mocking Mulligan as it does to deadly serious Stephen Dedalus (364). Mulligan - an "archetypal trickster" who suggests "both Eros and Thanatos, life and death, the elemental instincts of the body which include demise and decay," "mocks the possibility of resurrection" yet himself "defies death and makes eternal revivals" (370, 372). Accordingly, he is "central to the Joycean comedy" (377). The similar Judge is likewise central to Blood Meridian , though that novel - minus the epilogue - is overwhelmingly tragic. For despite the apparent final ascendancy of the man of the epilogue, McCarthy obviously gives great credence to the naturalistic vision of the priest of the body in Blood 139</page><page sequence="18">Meridian - much as he does in Suttree , where there are no scientists or medical students but where the huntsman (or whatever "dimly adumbrate" force animates nature) employs those predatory and/or scavenging "surgeons" who finally dissect all human beings (86). And he does so in a much darker vein than does Joyce, whose playful aestheticism in the latter half of Ulysses and in Finnegans Wake ultimately seems worlds removed from the grim existential themes of McCarthy's fiction. In any case, just as the mocking priest Mulligan seems to take over the narrative of Ulysses , so too does the vision of the Judge seem ultimately to encompass the fate of the Kid in Blood Meridian. Yet the epilogue finally subsumes that vision within a work of art which communicates what the Judge would seek to deny and destroy: a sense of the essential mystery of existence. So while I do not claim here that Suttree and Blood Meridian clearly exhibit the overarching vision of either a spiritual seeker (crypto-Catholic, Gnostic, or otherwise) or a worshipper at the altar of Art, I do contend that these two visions continually exist in conjunction with one another and with the harsh naturalistic vision that is also undeniably central to McCarthy's work. And I do believe that the expriest Tobin essentially speaks for McCarthy when, upon hearing the Judge's assertion that "there is no mystery," he whispers: "As if he weren't a mystery himself, the old hoodwinker" (250). For if we look at the whole of the novel the Judge, like Mulligan, finally belies his anti-mystical ideology simply by virtue of his own existence: certainly he is a mystery. Tobin senses it, and Suttree senses it, much as do Joyce and McCarthy. Despite the reductive claims of priests of the body, there is, as the conclusion to Child of God suggests, more to life than what can be seen in the dissecting room; there is a mystery implicit in nature itself, even if it 140</page><page sequence="19">might often seem to be the horrifying one Flannery O'Connor named when she wrote that "evil is not simply a problem to solved, but a mystery to be endured" (862). This is the mystery that McCarthy himself has clearly been most interested in exploring, a mystery that might be approached through religion or through art and that ultimately informs both. Notes 1 Knoxville friend Bill Kidwell suggests that Catholicism "embittered" McCarthy; his second wife, Anne DeLisle, speculates that he may have "felt guilty because he couldn't encompass [his family's beliefs] in his works" (quoted in Gibson). Whatever the case, the following comments by Don DeLillo, a writer of McCarthy's generation who has praised his fiction - and who greatly admires Joyce as well - seem like they might well be applied to McCarthy: "I think there is a sense of last things in my work that probably comes from a Catholic childhood. For a Catholic, nothing is too important to discuss or think about, because he's raised with the idea that he will die any minute now and that if he doesn't live his life in a certain way this death is simply the introduction to an eternity of pain. This removes a hesitation a writer might otherwise feel when he's approaching important subjects, eternal subjects. I think for a Catholic these things are part of ordinary life" (quoted in Pas saro). 2 My analysis of Portrait and Ulysses here draws on my unpublished M.A. thesis, "Preaching the Word: Priest, Poet, and Medicineman in Joyce's Ulysses ," completed under the direction of Weldon Thornton at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1996. 3 Linda Townley Woodson examined the influence of Catholic iconography on Suttree in her paper "Visual Rhetoric and Cognitive Identity in Suttree ," presented at the Suttree Silver Anniversary Conference in Knoxville in October 2004 (see below, pp. 210-25) . 4 Canfield also briefly considers that Suttree is "a double for McCarthy" who sees himself not only as an artist but "perhaps even a 141</page><page sequence="20">priest of art" (685). He further suggests that Suttree reveals McCarthy to be a "Catholic existentialist" (683, 686). Frank Dowling, who attended Knoxville's Catholic High School four years ahead of McCarthy and later became a Jesuit priest, told me at the Suttree Silver Anniversary Conference that McCarthy's younger brother Bill entered a Jesuit seminary in Louisiana in the late 1950s - i.e., at about the time that McCarthy began working on Suttree. 6 Suttree is apparently speaking aloud here, but to whom? Himself? An absent God? Stacey Peebles has rightly suggested in her unpublished paper "Irish Eyes: Joyce's Aesthetic and Ideological Presence in the Novels of Cormac McCarthy" - presented at the 2002 SCMLA Convention - that Suttree and Stephen alike tend to associate women with "the horrors of the grave" as well as "time itself," and both view female sexuality as "dangerous."
