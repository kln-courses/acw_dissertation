<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brigitte seifert, Metaphorisches Reden von Gott im Hoseabuch (FRLANT 166; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1996). Pp. x + 285. DM 98. This is a rigorous literary, exegetical, and theological study of metaphorical speech as it pertains to God in the Book of Hosea. Seifert divides her study into two main parts, "On the Theory of Metaphor," and "Exegesis," which she then subdivides. In chap. 1 of part 1, S. examines the classical concept of metaphor. She first outlines and discusses Aristotle's definition of metaphor and then gives lengthy consid- eration to the tradition of rhetoric, drawing attention to the thought of M. C. Beards- ley, H. Weinrich, C. Stoffer-Heibel, and A. J. Bjorndalen.</page><page sequence="2">556 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 59, 1997 Next, S. focuses on the phenomenology of metaphor. Here she examines closely the theories of R Ricoeur, M. Krieg, I. A. Richards, M. Black, and E. Jüngel. A brief summary and an assessment of the various theories on metaphor conclude chap. 1. In chap. 2 of part 1, S. deals with the theory of theological metaphor, distin- guishing between metaphor and theological concept, metaphor and simile, metaphor, allegory, and symbol, and metaphor and anthropomorphism. She then discusses the relationship between metaphor and analogy. In the last section of this chapter, S. devotes extensive attention to the metaphorical concept of God in relation to reve- lation. Here she highlights the contributions of J. M. Soskice, M. Hesse, and J. Koch, then presents the ideas of W. Pannenberg and E. Jüngel. In her remarks concluding this chapter, she raises the issue of revelation's role in determining theological meta- phors. She gives two examples from the Book of Hosea (Hos 1 : 1 and 12: 10), then uses these two examples to point out further that word and history, insofar as they pertain to revelation, interlock. Part 2 of S.'s work is an exegetical study of those passages in the Book of Hosea that contain metaphors related to the person of God and to one's understanding of God. In chap. 1 of part 2, "Deceived Life," S. provides a fresh translation, text- critical notes (where they are necessary), and a detailed exegesis of selected passages pertaining to specific topics. Topics and passages are "Israel as Untrue Wife and Sweetheart" (Hos 2:4-17,18-25), "The Marriage of Hosea as Symbol" (Hos 1:2b + 3a; 3:1-5), and "Whoring in Hosea 4-14" (Hos 4:11-14; 5:3 + 4; 9:1-6). In chaps. 2, 3, and 4 of part 2, S. considers the following topics and blocks of material: "Imminent Ruin" (Hos 5:12-14; 5:8-6:6; 7:11-12; 13:4-8), "Experiencing Care" (Hos 11:1-7; 11:4; 10: 1 l-13a; 11:3b; 7:1-2; 14:5), and "Incomprehensible Compas- sion" (Hos 11:8-11; 14:2-9). In chap. 5 of part 2, the concluding chapter, S. reflects on the Book of Hosea as a whole. Here, she comments on religious imagination in Israel in the eighth century b.c., the role that Baal played in the lives of the Israelites, and the need for the prophet Hosea to use metaphors apt for inveighing against Baal. In her final remarks, she summarizes the different metaphors for God in the Book of Hosea and argues that each contributes in its own way to a deeper understanding of who God is. The book ends with a short list of abbreviations and a very comprehensive bibli- ography. In sum, S.'s study is very detailed and thoughtful. Its fine style and organization make its reading both informative and pleasurable. S.'s methodical approach to the discussion of metaphor is to be commended. It would have been more helpful, per- haps, if at the end of every chapter or part, S. had included a summary not only of her major points of discussion but also of her own conclusions. While the focus of the work is primarily literary and exegetical, there are some key hermeneutical issues and questions related to S.'s exegetical study (e.g., in Hos 2:4-17; 4:11-14; 5:3 + 4; 9:1-6) that she does not raise. Such issues and questions have a direct impact on the use of metaphor and its relation to one's theological understanding of God and the prophets. On the whole, S.'s study is an important one for its insights and for the issues that it does and does not raise. It is a fine contribution to Hosean studies.
