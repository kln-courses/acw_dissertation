S. RCM. Classics A HISTORY OF GREEK RELIGION. By Martin P. Nilsson. Translated from the Swedish by F. J. Fielden. Oxford: Clarendon Press; London: Milford. 1925. 12s. 6d. net. PROFESSOR NILssoN has been long known as one of the foremost authorities on Greek religion, and has published standard works on Primitive Time-reckoning and on the Greek Calendar. In this book he, with his translator, supplies a want in English literature on the subject, for with the ex300tion of Dr. Farnell's valuable little Outline History, there existed previously no English work dealing in a systematic way with the development of pagan Greek belief and worship as a whole. His book is the more valuable in</page><page sequence="2">1925 Reviews 667 that it covers in brief scope all the various aspects from which Greek religion may be viewed-cult, myth, philosophic speculation, literary and artistic reactions, and so forth. In no other book is a more reasoned survey of growth and change in this most impor.. tant and all-embracing department of ancient life to be found. Greek religion has always tended to be the happy-hunting ground of doctrinaries who wished to see their own fads, from the " symbolism " of the eighteenth century to the " sociology " of modern times, mirrored in the wisdom of antiquity. From such mis leading dilettantism Professor Nilsson is refreshingly free, and his book may be relied on as a storehouse of sound historical doctrine. Unfortunately space, it would seem, has prevented him from giving as many references to his sources as one would wish, and the reader is puzzled here and there by inferences from unmentioned evidence. The translation is also a trifle on the heavy side, but having read some of Professor Nilsson's other work one is not sure that the blame attaches altogether to the translator. The present reviewer can only point to one printer's error, the accentuation of the word pharmako8 on p. 87. Perhaps the most striking feature of the book is its treatment of Greek religious origins. Another Swedish scholar, Pcrsson, had already pointed out evidences for the Minoan origin of the EIeu sinian cult. Professor Nilsson follows him boldly in showing what a large number of indications are already available for supporting the thesis that Greek religion as a whole has its roots in the Bronze Age Aegean. A natural thesis enough, one may say, but the fact remains that it has been for the first time systematically stated in this book. Anthropomorphism is noted as already a "Minoan" feature: the kinship between the Minoan goddess and such figures as Homer's Athene is attractively discussed; and in particular the probability is stressed that the hero-cult which was so prominent a feature in later Greek worship was already widespread in Mycen aean times. Professor Nilsson's discussion of Greek Mythology and its relations to folk-tale on the one hand and religion on the other is also noteworthy both to the classicist and perhaps to the student of folk-lore in general. In this connection, a fine paper by Sir Arthur Evans in a recent issue of the Journal of Hellenic Studies (1925), which shows us the Oedipus-myth on gems of the 15th century B.C., makes a useful commentary on what Professor Nilsson says. Towards such interesting fantasies as totemism in Early Greece and the tribal initiation cere600ies beloved by Cam bridge, he is healthily s300tical. He may perhaps be somewhat 2u2</page><page sequence="3">668 Studies [DEC. too much inclined to seek the origin of the gods in " nature-powers"; but his treatment of the Greek idea of divinity as power, and his iIutration of this by the well-known mana of anthropological jargon is very clear and helpful to the student. In his attitude toward the origins of individual god-figures Professor Nilsson is conservative. He ac300ts the German doctrine of Apollo's Asiatic origin and the explanation of Dionysos as " son Of Zeus," but he regards the latter god as ancient in the Aegean and has no mention of that obsession of most recent scholars, his Thracian origin and late date. An interesting derivation is that of the horse-god Poseidon from the Caiple bdna which belong to him in his function as god of the sea, and another is that of Pluto from the wealth of the stored corn. He agrees in the main with the view that Homer's religion is something special to either the poet or his place, and is not to be used as evidence for early belief; and he thinks that, Homer apart, we can trace a steady develop ment from the religious ideas proper to Bronze Age kingdoms and their high civilisation, to the cruder practices of the Greek middle age and the system imposed by the City State. Hero-worship in particular, as a widespread observance, he convincingly derives from private ancestor-cults of earlier times, and shows how the State tended generally to take over or suppress such private cults. There may lie in this evolution perhaps some possible explanation of the peculiar fate which befell the mystery-religions; originally private cults, they may have failed, at least in Athens, to have secured recognition by the newly organised State of the 6th century. Professor Nilsson is again wisely cautious on Orphism, and carefully avoids deriving it by the usual formula from a Thracian invasion, emphasising rather its ancient elements. He treats it, however, as an "epidemic" which was curbed by Apollo, and here allows himself to exaggerate somewhat. His chapter on "Legalism and Mysticism," dealing with these two opposing forces in sixth century Greece, is excellent on the whole and breaks new ground, as also does his general emphasis on the secular side of the State religion in the 5th century. He has many illuminating remarks on the effect upon men like Herodotus and Sophocles of the various tendencies-rationalistic, mystical, etc.-which played upon the mixture of Homeric mythology and State-ordered cultus that made up their religion. Few scholars have succeeded so well in assigning its due proportion to each of these influences, and especially in distinguishing things Homeric from things legal or customary. Perhaps in the failure of the State-cult organised by the demo cratic city-a cult which practically worshipped the State itself</page><page sequence="4">1925 Reviews 669</page></plain_text>
