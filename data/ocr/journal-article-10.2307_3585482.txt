<plain_text><page sequence="1">TESOL QUARTERLY Vol. 9, No. 2 June 1975 Values Clarification Theory in ESL and Bilingual Education Kathleen Green Because of the close relationship between language and culture, lan- guage learning necessarily involves culture learning. The culture of an individual or group is determined by his or its values. Bilingual/ bicultural education requires that student and teacher understand their own values as well as those of each other. One method of achieving this understanding is through the use of values clarification strategies. After presenting the basic theory behind values clarification, some strat- egies that have been used successfully in a college level English as a Second Language course for foreign students in the United States are discussed. The versatility of these strategies is demonstrated through examples of how the same strategies used with the college-level students can be adapted for use in a bilingual elementary school classroom. Few linguists or language teachers would disagree that there is a rela- tionship between language and culture. Whether language determines culture or culture determines language has been a subject of much discussion. Grammarians, like Fillmore, who is searching for deep structure linguistic similarities (Fillmore 1968: 1-88), and psychologists, like Lambert, who believes that psychological similarities between cultures are more evident than differences (Lambert 1974), admit that cultural differences do exist (Lambert 1974) and that language is the vehicle whereby a person acquires his knowledge of those differences. He learns these differences either indi- rectly by having someone tell him the differences or directly through his own attempts to communicate with people who speak different languages or dialects than he does. There is absolutely nothing like the failure to com- municate ideas or needs to another person to make us aware of our own differences, our own existential alienation and isolation from our audience. Conversely, success in communication, whether it be a baby's crying to be fed or changed or an adult's communication of his innermost feelings, creates a feeling of intimacy and unity with the audience. Thus, a person's failures and successes in communication, determine his feelings of "we" and "they," "us" and "them." It follows (though I have no statistical proof of this) that the more people with whom a person feels he communicates success- fully, the more people he will consider to be "we's," persons like himself. Thus, he widens his cultural boundaries. If his ability to communicate Ms. Green is an American Literature and Spanish teacher at Henry Sibley High School in West St. Paul, Minnesota. This paper was written while she was a teaching assistant in the English as a Second Language program at the University of Min- nesota in the Spring of 1974. 155</page><page sequence="2">TESOL QUARTERLY crosses certain linguistic, geographical, and socio-economical boundaries, he is considered to have become bilingual and bicultural. Values Clarification Theory How does values clarification theory fit into the communication process? First, let us look at what values clarification theory is. Values clarifica- tion is based on the principle that what we do is determined by our values and beliefs. Unfortunately, most of us are unclear about what our basic values are; so when we are faced with making a decision between two alter- native courses of action, we often find it difficult. Values clarification, as first proposed by Louis Rath, looks at values not from the stative point of view of content, but from the dynamic point of view of the process of valuing (Simon 1972: 3). It advocates strategies which can be employed to examine the processes people use to establish their values. Often these strategies are also a means whereby a person can discover what values lie beneath those values he consciously affirms. Values clarification strategies are not ends in themselves. They are meant to be used with other subject matter, for our beliefs as to the "value" of the subject matter determines what subject matter we learn.1 Use of values clarification in the classroom requires a teacher who (1) is willing to examine his/her own values; (2) can accept opinions different from his/her own; (3) encourages a classroom atmosphere of honesty and respect; and (4) is a good listener. As I see it, the qualities of a class in which values clarification is stressed are also the qualities that will foster enthusiasm for the subject matter and better communication among stu- dents and between the students and the teacher. These two criteria seem to me to be basic to motivating a student to learn a foreign language. Let us examine how the above ideas might be used in two different kinds of language learning situations. First, we shall look at the use of values clarification in a college grammar-based composition class for foreign stu- dents; then, let us look at some possibilities for its use with an elementary school class of bilingual students. College Level ESL One of the major problems in the college level English as a second lan- guage class is that foreign students with an ability to express the most complex ideas in their own language suddenly find themselves in the position of having to communicate in a language in which they have only a rudimen- tary knowledge of vocabulary and grammatical structures. The teacher must constantly find ways of convincing the student that he realizes that the stu- dent has intelligent, worthwhile thoughts, even though his ability to use the language is minimal. In a class with a values clarification orientation, this problem is partly solved as a part of the class. The teacher conveys the ILambert (1974) applies this concept to facility in language learning. 156</page><page sequence="3">VALUES CLARIFICATION THEORY idea that he himself does not know "everything about everything" and wel- comes his students' input into his knowledge about the world. One way that I have found to do this is by using various values clarification questions as composition topics. Simon (1972) states that values clarification pro- cesses involve. Prizing one's beliefs and behaviors 1. prizing and cherishing 2. publicly affirming, when appropriate Choosing one's beliefs and behaviors 3. choosing from alternatives 4. choosing after consideration of consequences 5. choosing freely Acting on one's beliefs 6. acting 7. acting with a pattern, consistency, and repetition Composition topics based on these processes require students to make choices and to affirm those choices. Because values involve a variety of sub- ject areas (Simon 1972: 15, politics, religion, work, leisure time, school, love, sex, family, possessions, race, war, peace, rules, etc.) there is always something about which each student has sufficient knowledge to write a com- position. Furthermore, because values clarification stresses choice-making, the student is free to choose what aspect of a topic he wishes to talk about and how much he wants to say. He is not forced to accept the values of the author of a text as he would if he were writing a supposedly "free" compo- sition like the following: "Write a paragraph beginning, 'The future of the world is perilous, but not hopeless.'" (Robinson 1967: 114). Finally, while values clarification topics allow the student freedom of choice in thinking, they also allow the teacher freedom of choice in their use because they can be adapted to teach a variety of grammatical structures. Here are some of the techniques I found successful with college-level students. The first exercise was called "The Moon Problem." In this exercise, stu- dents were divided into small groups (3-4 students) to discuss a sheet in which they were presented with the problem of being lost on the moon and having to decide, as an astronaut crew, which of fifteen things are important for their survival trek to their space ship (NTL Institute, 1970). Students rank order the items from most important to least important. While there is usually little question as to the most important item, the ranking of the other fourteen is largely a matter of personal choice with no right or wrong answers. As members of the group, students must convince the other stu- dents of what is important and be willing to listen to the expertise of fellow group members. Students in the sciences are able to use their technical knowledge, while students with other knowledge, such as English vocabulary or verbal persuasion skill, can use these talents in the discussion. The stu- dents combine their vocabularies for use in understanding the problem; they become involved in a task which requires communication with other mem- 157</page><page sequence="4">TESOL QUARTERLY bers of the group; they practice both reading and communication skills in an atmosphere where they are involved in helping each other learn. After the discussion of the Moon Problem, which should take at least thirty minutes of class time, students are asked to write a composition about the moon in which they condense their topic to a specific area that interests them or about which they are knowledgeable. Some areas I suggested were a scientific description of the moon, the value of going to the moon, the significance of the historical event of man's landing on the moon, and a legend about the moon from their country. The compositions I received ranged from an essay on the connection of the moon with poetry and love to a description of the moon's soil content, an essay praising the United States' technical progress, a biographical account of one student's activities at the time of the first moon landing, a review of science fiction about the moon, and a description of the in-class problem of moon survival. As can be seen, this topic offers an excellent opportunity for the teacher to discover the student's interests, rhetorical preferences (argument, description, anal- ysis, etc.), and their basic compositional skills. It also provides the teacher with an opportunity to reinforce the idea that all of the students' ideas are worthwhile and that corrections on themes will be based on how well English is used to convey the ideas, not on whether the teacher agrees with the ideas. Students obviously found the topic broad enough, most seemed to enjoy it, and at least one remembered it as his favorite composition topic. To teach adjectives and intensifiers in descriptions, the device of student- constructed riddles was used. First, students were arbitrarily assigned people to describe, such as their English teachers or commonly known world figures. A contest was held in which students guessed the answers to the riddles of their classmates. The student who gained the most points was the winner. (Points were given for being able to guess from other students' descriptions and for the number of people who could guess from the student's own de- scription.) After analyzing some of the mistakes made in this first exercise and after providing more explanation of descriptive techniques, I wrote an example of description of myself. In a second riddle contest, students had to describe themselves in such a way that others, although not given the obvious details of name or country of origin, could guess who they were. Thus, students had to make choices about what characteristics they felt would describe themselves and what characteristics others would see. The use of descriptive riddles led naturally to the making of comparisons. Basic comparative forms were presented in a sample essay about the physical and behavioral changes of a pet. (At least in the United States pets are a suitable subject for such attention!) Then, students were asked to write their own essays on something that was changing, comparing its past to its present. Another way to initiate this activity using values clarification strat- egies would be to list "Twenty Things I Like to Do" (Simon 1972: 30) and mark them for "things I liked to do five years ago" or "things my parents also enjoy." Students could then write a paper comparing their past pref- 158</page><page sequence="5">VALUES CLARIFICATION THEORY erences to their present preferences or the taste of their parents to their own tastes. Comparisons are an excellent method of examining values, but the use of comparisons should not imply positive or negative traits in an individual culture, or subject; however, a teacher can fall into this trap. To avoid this, one class was devoted to showing how comparisons could be used in para- graphs with different purposes. The paragraphs included one that presup- posed that the author's purpose was to convince his reader, another that was merely informative, and another that emphasized imaginative descrip- tion (poetic metaphor). Thus, the students could see how the writer's pur- pose determined his choice of comparative forms and his choice of what to compare in the paragraph. Of course, the most often employed use of comparisons, and especially superlatives, is persuasion. So, students were given an opportunity to use these forms in a composition entitled "The Best Country in the World." When assigning this composition, I stressed that students might choose any country, but that they should give reasons why it was better than other countries, and why they chose it as the best. Allowing students to choose which country they wanted gave them a choice of a wider range of values to express than if they had been asked to write on "My good experiences in the United States" or "Why I miss my country." Of course, many students chose to write about the United States or their native land, but many ven- tured into far-off places. (One Polish student wrote about New Zealand, and a French student titled his work "The Land of the Imagination.") An even more personal essay, in that it requires the student to examine what he values about himself, would be one on the topic of "What I Do Better than Anyone Else" or "What I Do Best."2 Both types of composition offer the student an opportunity to use both comparative and superlative forms. He also must decide whether he wishes to persuade his reader of his talents or merely describe them. Although the exercise is a type of forced choice (Simon 1972: 94), in that the student must decide what his primary talent is, he does have the option of comparing himself with other people (this may be highly objectionable in some cultures.) or simply comparing what he is able to do with what he is unable to do. One of the paralinguistic facts about American culture according to Christina Bratt Paulston (1974) is that Americans can ask each other all sorts of personal questions, but the person asked is allowed to evade or lie about the answer. This assignment offers the teacher an opportunity for teaching this cultural idiosyncrasy. The teacher should stress that any qualities presented, no matter how trivial (a value decision) or humorous (one student suggested that he would title his paper "What I Do Best Is Sleep") are acceptable as long as the student develops the idea fully with reasons to support his statements. 2Simon, based on the "I am Proud Whip," p. 134. A whip is a kind of rapid chain drill in which students must finish the sentence "I am proud that I can . . or "I am proud of . . 159</page><page sequence="6">TESOL QUARTERLY Another way of teaching students about American culture, and especially how we settle our differences, is to use worksheets based on news events which demonstrate conflicting values in our society. For example, as a work- sheet on subject-verb number concord, I wrote a description of the Wounded Knee Trial in St. Paul, Minnesota. The description emphasized how the different participants felt about choosing jury members and how the general public felt about the American Indian Movement. After discussing the worksheet in class, I asked students to write on "My First Encounter with the American Indian." The papers revealed that many students did, indeed, have stereotypes of Indians based on American westerns and James Fen- imore Cooper, but they also revealed that being in this country had influ- enced their previously held beliefs. Although for many students this was an exercise demonstrating how the media influence values, one student wrote an essay on his actual physical encounter with American Indians and how that influenced his beliefs. While it may seem that the primary purpose of the above exercise is to teach American culture or how our values are influenced by our experiences, it is a particularly adaptable method for teaching a variety of grammatical items. The teacher can construct the worksheet using either cloze or multiple-choice techniques to demonstrate the correct use of such diverse items as the use of articles, tense endings, passive versus active voice, con- cord, the use of modals, punctuation, etc. He can then concentrate on cor- recting the themes for those items which were practiced on the worksheet. Another extremely valuable use of values clarification techniques is in teaching the meaning of the modals and their correct use. Since modals are used to convey the speaker's attitudes, they are a necessity in a compo- sition where a student is asked to write about his beliefs and values. An especially good way to use value strategies in this area is to introduce the idea of wishing, of choosing preferred conditions. This is excellent for teach- ing the use of modals in the conditional. Two compositions were assigned with wishing as a basic theme. The first was "What Would You Be If You Could Be Anything" or "What Would You Do If You Could Do Anything" and the second was "If I Were President of the United States I Would . . ." The first two offered the student the opportunity to make use of were, could and would in conditional sentences. This second topic, "If I Were President of the United States I Would . . ." is an unfinished sentence (Simon 1972: 241) which elicited not only the would form, but also the student's opinion of the American political system. Obviously, other values could be elicited by changing the statement to "If I Were Rich, I Would . . .," "If I Were a Member of the Opposite Sex, I Would . . .," "If I Were Seventy Years Old, I Would . . .," or "If I Were Going to Die Tomorrow, I Would . . .". The teacher should take care when assigning this type of composition that the values elicited are not too risky for the student to express. For instance, some foreign students might feel freer about giving their honest opinion about the President of the United States than about their own leaders, 160</page><page sequence="7">VALUES CLARIFICATION THEORY others just the opposite. The teacher must judge for himself which "I wish .. ." or "I would . .." items would elicit a suitable volume of response. One final word should be said about using values clarification techniques in the ESL classroom. Public affirmation is an integral part of value forma- tion (Simon 1972: 19). Every opportunity should be given students to share their opinions in class, but they should not be penalized for wishing to keep their opinions to themselves. One method of sharing compositions is to invite those students who have written particularly good or interesting composi- tions to make corrections of their compositions and make copies to share with the whole class. It should be made clear that they don't have to share their work if they don't want to do so. It should also be made clear that the copies the class sees are corrected copies, so that other class members do not feel that they are so inferior in English ability as compared to other students that they might as well give up. Special skills that the writers do show, such as sticking to the topic, paragraph organization, sentence va- riety, can be emphasized as examples of why the work was chosen and the kinds of things all students should try to include in their writing. This sharing process accomplishes two goals: (1) it offers the student positive reinforcement of his communication act; (2) it assures students that they are able to communicate their ideas in English. My experience with basing my classroom teaching on values clarification theory and using the above techniques was very successful. The classroom atmosphere was exciting and enjoyable. Students were able to work to- gether, sharing their varied knowledge of English. They felt free to tell me when they were having trouble understanding what I was teaching and to ask questions about things they didn't understand about English. Although they were not always punctual about turning in out-of-class compositions, they did eventually turn them in, and they did their own work. Some of them made only average progress in improving their grammar, spelling, or punctuation, but they all demonstrated an ability to use the English lan- guage to convey not only thoughts, but also feelings. I learned a lot about my students which increased my enjoyment of my task and which I hope also increased theirs. Bilingual Education After reading the above, one might say, "Well, I'm convinced that values clarification theory works with college students learning English to further their studies in the United States, but aren't they a pretty sophisticated group? Do you really think this will work with elementary school bilingual students?" The answer is an emphatic "Yes!" One of the fascinating things about values clarification strategies is their amazing adaptability for any age group. Furthermore, a teacher who bases his teaching on values clarification must create the kind of classroom atmosphere that is conducive to learning. Studies have shown that it is the teacher's attitudes and expectations of the 161</page><page sequence="8">TESOL QUARTERLY child which most influence his ability to learn (Adkins 1971: 26). More- over, a class of Anglos and non-Anglos examining their attitudes in an atmo- sphere of mutual respect seems an excellent way to create bicultural under- standing of those cultural aspects Sancho refers to as "intangibles." (Sancho 1974) As examples of how values clarification strategies could be used in a bilingual elementary school classroom of Anglos and Chicanos, I would like to take some of the techniques I used in the college classroom and show how they could be adapted for the elementary level. (Some had already been adapted from high school materials for the college level.) In the Moon Problem, the technique of rank ordering is used. This can be adapted in several ways. First, instead of handing out sheets and having the students read the problem, the teacher might wish to tell a story using puppets or other illustrations. The story could be an imaginary tale about anthropomorphic animals, or it could be about children. The story need not be about the moon. It could be about other survival problems. For example, one teacher used this technique in a fourth-grade social studies class for a unit about the migration across the Great Plains. She asked the students which things they would carry with them if their covered wagon broke down and they had to abandon it. In a bilingual classroom, migrant children might find a situation in which they had to choose items to take on their migratory route especially relevant. Rather than personal survival, students might con- sider a story about societal survival in which they had to choose which workers of various occupations they would want to save in a disaster. It would be instructive to see whether they would save the traditional com- munity helpers: the policeman, doctor, teacher, etc. or the ranch hand, waitress, grape picker, plumber, etc. Children would find understanding the vocabulary of any of these rank order situations necessary, and a variety of rank ordering tasks could be used to teach different vocabulary, such as household items or occupational names, as in the above examples. A picture of the items to be ranked could be used with the word to teach its meaning. Besides vocabulary, the rank order task would also have subject matter content such as history, geography, science, or career education. In addition, the class would have a first-hand opportunity to see cross-cultural differences and similarities. (Would a Chicano boy prefer to take a guitar, a football, or a radio with him on the migrant route? What would an Anglo boy take? Would the girls make different choices altogether?) Riddles can also be used in the elementary classroom. The teacher might introduce them by reading some riddles in Spanish and English. If the students are beginning to read, he might put some of the simpler ones on the chalkboard or bulletin board with illustrations. Riddles could be used to teach question formation and adjective post-modification versus adjective pre-modification, both of which contrast in English and Spanish. If the teacher wishes to concentrate on question formation, he might try taping the name of a person or thing on a child's back and having the children ask 162</page><page sequence="9">VALUES CLARIFICATION THEORY each other questions about who or what they are. He might make the addi- tional stipulation that if the person or thing is a Spanish word, the student must use Spanish for the questions, and if it is an English word, the student must use English. If he wished to stress adjectival use, he might have the students make up their own riddles to describe themselves or an object they would like to be. Instead of using the "Twenty Things I Like to Do" list to teach com- parisons, the teacher might want to use it to teach predicate forms. Or it might be changed to "Ten Things I Can Do" and "Ten Things I Like to Do" or "Twenty Things I Want to Do When I Grow Up." With the last two, students could examine their expectations of themselves and what they will have to do to fulfill those expectations. Thus, they would get practice not only in the would like plus infinitive and want plus infinitive forms, but also in setting goals for themselves. Instead of using "What I Do Best" as a composition topic, students could use the "I am Proud Whip" (Simon 1972: 134). In this activity, the stu- dents rapidly fill in the blank, as in a drill, in the sentence, "I am proud of . . .". They can list a personal accomplishment, or they might be in- structed to list someone else's accomplishments. This activity can also be developed into a song (Simon: 327). (Where possible the teacher might want to use other "values whips" for oral drills.) The whip gives the student an opportunity to reveal what he thinks is an important accomplishment. If he chooses to participate, he also chooses to affirm his personal worth or the worth of another individual. For some students, this may be a risky ven- ture, so this kind of activity offers an opportunity for the teacher to stress acceptance of what people say and the ideas of not ridiculing others for what they believe. To illustrate this, he might want to tell or read a story beforehand about people or animals who say something that is ridiculed and show how they coped with the problem. Elementary students, too, can examine the effect of their personal ex- periences on their beliefs. Instead of writing about their "First Encounter with the American Indian," they might tell or write about "The First Time I Crossed the Street by Myself," "The First Time I Got Paid for Working," "My First Day at School," "My First Friend," "My First Teacher," or "The Best/Worst Thing That Ever Happened to Me." These could be the sub- jects of small sharing groups or trios (Simon, 177) in which the students compare and contrast their experiences. Such trios could be used for con- versation practice either in Spanish or English (or alternately for both from one session to the next) or as opportunities to consolidate experiences for background materials for short stories or skits to present to the class later. Students could use the skits to illustrate how they solved the problem in the situation or leave the situation open-ended for other students to sug- gest solutions. The development of skits could be expanded to include imaginary situations in the past (history subject matter) or imaginary sit- uations in nature (science subject matter). 163</page><page sequence="10">TESOL QUARTERLY The use of role-playing, as above, is a good method for beginning the activity of wishing. Students might choose not only the situations but also the characters they wanted to play. They could discuss which characters, people, animals, or things they would like to be and why. This is an ex- cellent way to examine cultural beliefs about animals and could also be used with nature films and texts to show that much of what we attribute to animals depends on our culture, not on scientific fact. Students might try playing both a character they admire and one they dislike. This affords a unique opportunity for the teachers to learn what paralinguistic features impress themselves on youngsters. It could also show what characteristics the children value in others. In these activities, students should become highly aware of cultural differences and similarities. If the activities are presented in an atmosphere of respect and tolerance, all students in the class should come to appreciate these differences and similarities and to feel that both their own values and the values of others have merit. I have mentioned only a few techniques for using values clarification strategies in the bilingual/bicultural classroom. There are many other strat- egies focusing on different areas of value conflict that also could be used or adapted successfully for the elementary bilingual classroom. If a teacher uses even a few of them effectively, I think his rewards will be great. He will find himself inventing his own strategies and adapting others; he will find also that he has a class that is open to examining its previously held beliefs and thus, open to learning.
