<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Hermeneutical Reading of Epipsychidion AGNES PETER HE critical response to Shelley's poetry has always been sub- ject to ever-changing literary canons and the political percep- tions shaping the intellectual climate of any given period dur- ing the past one hundred and fifty years: his poetical work and polit- ical thought have consequently been crudely distorted, or at least simplified, by both the pro- and the anti-Shelleyan critical statements that have come down to us. Any attempt made on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth to reassess the meaning and significance of his work will once again be necessarily caught up in Heidegger's "hermeneutic circle" and will be inevitably followed by a new reval- uation as soon as there is a perceptible change in the Spirit of the Age. After Shelley the incarnation of the spirit of revolution (Robert Browning, Swinburne), after Shelley the Neoplatonist in search of symbols to express his intuition of Intellectual Beauty (Yeats), after Shelley "an affair of our adolescence" (T. S. Eliot), after Shelley in whose poetry "the critical intelligence is switched off" (F. R. Leavis), after Harold Bloom's Shelley, the Blakean visionary, and after Northrop Frye's Shelley, the poet of mythopoeic imagination, it is easy enough to predict that Shelley-and Coleridge and Keats as well-will soon be generally seen as the first poets in the Western tra- dition to articulate the existentialist crisis. Some of the major poems of Shelley can be read as documents, and very poignant documents, too, of his awareness of"the break-down of the atemporal, Cartesian, anthropomorphic and ego-centric Renaissance tradition," "the dreadfully raging discord" diagnosed by Nietzsche between art and truth, and also as an anticipation of Heidegger's resolution of the dis- cord by its transference to the essence of truth itself.1 I.

Shelley seems to articulate in some of his poems his anxiety concerning the validity of the Platonic concept. Some hundred years later, Yeats, although he draws heavily on the symbolism, concepts and poetic strategies em- ployed by Shelley, emancipates himself from the influence of his "covering cherub" by destroying the Shelleyan tradition, and carries out, in the context of the history of poetry, "the phenomenological destruction of the metaphysical traditions," as Heidegger calls his own contribution to the history of philosophy.2 The very same process can be seen at the same time as the history of the conflict be- tween the claims of the sympathetic and the creative aspects of the imagination, or as the history of the increasing awareness in modern times of the limitations, the existential-ontological foundation, of language. For my analysis of these shifts I have chosen three texts: Milton's "I1 Penseroso," Shelley's Epipsychidion, and Yeats's "The Tower." The three poems are closely related, being all three attempts to ana- lyze the potential of the human mind, which in all of these texts is objectified in the image of the tower. They can be read as exegeses of the Biblical text: "Go to, let us build us . . . a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven" (Genesis, II). Babel, the Hebrew variant of the Assyrian Babylon, which means the gate of God, is symbolic of man's desire to attain divine status. The tower is destroyed by the Lord; the attempt to communicate with God is frustrated; and lan- guage (which Heidegger calls "the House of Being," implying that "a dialogue from house to house remains nearly impossible"3) is sent upon "the children of men" as a form of punishment for their arro- gant presumption. 2.

"L'Allegro" and "I1 Penseroso" are both analyses of the way the imagination can release the mind from the limitation of time and space and thus can supersede the dualism of mind and nature. "L'Allegro" is a descrip- tion ofa landscape dominated by the Sun: here the conflict between mind and nature is resolved in the sympathetic identification of the subject with the object; the individual mind can transcend its time and space limitations by becoming absorbed in the unreflective hap- piness of nature. By embracing the minute it attains a sense of per- manence. In the complementary "I1 Penseroso" the landscape, this time dominated by the Moon, is internalized. Here the senses are cut off from the visible world: in the gloom it is the creative imagination, the Platonic Contemplation, that enables the mind to leave the body behind, to "Forget [the] self to Marble" (line 42) with "looks com- mercing with the skies" (line 39). It is the Lamp, probably a symbol of the creative imagination, that illumines the path for the mind in its striving toward the Absolute: let my Lamp at midnight hour, Be seen in some high lonely Tower, Where I may oft out-watch the Bear, With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere The spirit of Plato to unfold What worlds or what vast Regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook. (lines 85-92) The mind eventually steps out of the moment and surveys history and nature, both emblems of the Eternal Mind, and the meditative expe- rience ends in ecstasy, the intuition of the Good. Milton is convinced that history and nature both cover up and disclose the Ultimate. He knows his Plotinus who claims: "That which is beyond this [the In- tellect] we call the nature of the Good, which holds beauty as a screen before it.4 4. Plotinus, Ennead 1.6.9, tr. A.H.

It is a most revealing document that seems to corroborate Plato's hypothesis that the creative impulse is very close to the sexual drive: an eloquent record of the psychology of self-transcendence as both an intellectual and erotic experience. What this analysis may of- fer as a new insight is that the poem can be interpreted as a profound realization of the paradox inherent in the quest for unity with Being outside time. Before the ultimate unity is described, with his charac- teristic gesture Shelley creates a vision of a paradisal islet, a wilderness of prehistoric, pastoral beauty. The scene is dominated by a tower:5 ... the chief marvel of the wilderness Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how None of the rustic island-people know. (lines 483-485) The Lamp of Milton is mentioned, but it is obscured: the withdrawal from the world of sense is more radical. Shelley probably recognized Milton's grandiose error, the separation of the sympathetic and the creative imagination, as well as Milton's sublime egotism. Shelley's tower is a correction of the Miltonic edifice of the mind; it represents the generic, collective consciousness: it was reared "ere crime / Had been invented" (lines 488-489), before unity was lost. The individ- ual mind can take refuge in the Platonic-Hegelian notion of recol- lection: tradition is to be begun again ("all the antique and learned imagery / Has been erased" in "the lampless halls" (lines 498-499, 503); instead of the egotistical solipsism of the Romantic stance, a re- turn to the primordial sense of truth is offered as a resolution of the conflict of the self-reflexive ego and atemporal truth. Shelley internalizes the Platonic quest for union with the divine. He creates an image, which ostensibly is a mortal woman, but actu- ally functions as a metaphor for his own immortal aspirations, "a soul out of[his] soul" (line 238), an antiself. 5. Compare "those skiey towers / Where Thought's crowned powers / Sit watching your dance, ye happy Hours!"

(lines 287-289) The epipsyche is an objectivization of the lofty hopes of the poet, an antinomy of his despair, the reification of his longing for perfection and permanence. The poet wants to embrace the creature of his own creative imagination, but the attempt is a frustrating experience. Shelley's frustration can be explained on three different planes. First, it can be attributed to Shelley's awareness of the conflict be- tween the creative and the sympathetic aspects of the imagination. The creative imagination both molds an epipsyche and expresses it in poetry. The sympathetic imagination moves toward union with the epipsyche and consequent transcendence of the world of the poem. Shelley reveals the dilemma in the concluding lines of his vision: Woe is me! The winged words on which my soul would pierce Into the height of love's rare Universe, Are chains of lead around its flight of fire- I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire! (lines 587-591)6 Second, the lines can be read as Shelley's realization of the inade- quacy of language, the error of identifying logos with ratio in the Western (as opposed to the Oriental) tradition. We may recall De- mogorgon's statement: "the deep truth is imageless" (Prometheus Un- bound, II.iv.i i6) or Plotinus' reiterated claim that silence is the only adequate form of communicating the mind's intuition of the nature of the One. The mysterious answer Plotinus' nature gives to the question about the ontological status of the One reads like this: "You ought not to ask, but to understand in silence, you, too, just as I am silent and not in the habit of talking" (Ennead 111.8.4). The human mind itself is limited by its being entrapped in the world of time. Or to use Heidegger's terms, 6. George Bomstein, Yeats and Shelley (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970), p.

Also because of Dasein's situation, all interpretation emerges out of and toward Dasein's interest or involvement with those things in-the-world which he intends to interpret. Dasein is necessarily predisposed toward the "object" of his interpretation, thereby making "objec- tive" interpretation impossible,. Epipsychidion is not the only document of Shelley's awareness of the inadequacy of traditional language, of Heidegger's thesis that "the au- thentic use of language to bring about disclosure becomes, through its repetition in an assertion, an inauthentic expression of something present-at-hand in which Dasein's disclosedness is covered up."8 In a letter of I8 I2 Shelley writes: "But words are merely signs of ideas, how many evils, &amp; how great spring from the annexing inadequate &amp; improper ideas to words .... [W]e only want one distinct sign for one idea;-do you not think that there is much more danger of our wanting ideas for the signs of them already made, than our wanting these signs for inexpressible ideas[?]"' Third, eventually the breaking off of the poem can be attributed to Shelley's fear that not only the traditional language is sadly limited by actuality, but that the Platonic dream that behind the actuality there is a realm of permanence is an illusory fixation of the human mind, that behind Plotinus's screen, behind the "painted veil" of actuality, behind the "dome of many-colored glass," or the subtle veil woven by the Witch of Atlas, the wizard lady of the creative imagination, there is only a vacuum, the void. The sonnet, "Lift not the painted veil," is one of the best-known documents of this anxiety. Where there are no words, probably there is nothing. In his essay on The Na- ture of Language Heidegger quotes Stefan George's poem The Word: "So I renounced and sadly see: / Where word breaks off no thing may be."'o The silence of Plotinus, the inarticulate cry of Shelley, is 7.

In Yeats's poetry there are three important poems where the tower image is used. Put side by side they illustrate his own painful wrestling with the Neoplatonic tradition. In a note to "The Winding Stairs" Yeats relates his own towers to Shelley's and explains that he has used them as symbols comparing "their winding stairs to the philosophi- cal gyres.""' In "Ego Dominus Tuus" Ille is "leaving the lamp burn- ing alone beside an open book" in the tower. In "The Phases of the Moon" the lamp is put out, and eventually in "The Tower," most significantly, the lamp is not mentioned at all. Here Yeats seems to reject the solidified dualism of Plato and Plotinus, the separation of the actual and the ideal: "I mock Plotinus' thought / And cry in Plato's teeth." He accepts the "winding stairs," the "philosophical gyres"; he re- signs himself to the idea of the inability of the mind to get released from the gyres. He understands that even supported by collective memory (the tower without the lamp) the mind is entrapped in the world of generation. Yeats comes to the conclusion that the conflict between the actual and the ideal, between the sympathetic and the creative imaginations, the conflict between Milton's Sun and Moon, the conflict between Shelley's psyche and epipsyche, can be resolved in the symbol, the sign that is seen as the simultaneous destruction and recreation of the tradition. The poet will grasp Unity of Being by developing a disinterested attitude, and while being supported by tradition, by the primordial sense of truth retained in the collective memory of his race, he will have to be content to remain within the confines of actuality: Now shall I make my soul, Compelling it to study In a learned school Till the wreck of body, I.

This is not the articulate Neoplatonic ecstasy of Milton, nor the inarticulate Neoplatonic ecstasy of Shelley: it is the realization "that authentic freedom is possible only within actuality,"12 that the discord between art and truth is part of the essence of truth, and consequently that art is a most authentic representation of truth.13 Eiitviis Lordind University, Budapest I12.
