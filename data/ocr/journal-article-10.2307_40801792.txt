<plain_text><page sequence="1">320 American Anthropologist · Vol. 112, No. 2 · June 2010 Website Review Confessions of an Aca-Fan: The Official Weblog of Henry Jenkins www.henryjenkins.org, accessed December 16, 2009. Teri Silvio Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica Henry Jenkins is one of the few humanities scholars whose work has been as influential outside of the academy as in it, opening up not only new fields in media studies but also new directions in media practice. He cofounded the inter- disciplinary Comparative Media Studies Program at MIT as well as a number of collaborative projects such as the Education Arcade, "a consortium of educators and business leaders working to promote the educational use of computer and video games" (www.henryjenkins.org/aboutme.html). Over the past quarter- century, Jenkins has become a cen- tral node in a vast network of academics (including anthro- pologists, sociologists, political scientists, economists, psy- chologists, film studies, cultural studies, and media studies scholars), media fans, game designers, marketing executives, artists, and activists. Jenkins' personal weblog (www.henryjenkins.org) is neither an online diary nor a simple collection of themat- ically related texts; it is more like the ongoing conference of a very large and interdisciplinary association - one where attendees can panel-hop at their own convenience and not miss anything. The blog is titled "Confessions of an Aca- Fan" (an aca-Jan being someone who is both a fan and an academic), and the posts vary widely in tone from the aca- demic and technocratic ("Crowdsourcing and Governance") to the intimate and fannish ("My Secret Life as a Klingon"). The issues under debate on this blog are also quite diverse: from whether social-networking media are democratizing or reinscribing class and race divisions in the United States to how cell phones are changing the experience of religious devotion in India and how intellectual property law is, and should be, applied to fan-made videos on YouTube. Posts include Jenkins' course syllabi; reports on events he's orga- nizing or has just attended; and scholarly reviews of films, games, and graphic novels. Most of the content, however, is provided by others and is more collaborative. For example, throughout 2007, Jenkins organized a series of dialogues on the topic of gender and fan studies, pairing male and female writers (academics, fans, and aca-fans) to reflect on issues such as the status of fan studies in the academy, the aesthetics and politics of slash fiction, and the globalization of Japanese popular culture. The conversations can get repetitious and reflect the obsessions and limitations of small areas of research, but there is a huge amount of material archived at the site, and because the blog is well -organized and easy to navigate, it is not difficult to find what interests you. The home page presents the most recent posts and a bar at the top of the page allows the viewer to click on and move to Jenkins's self-introduction, a list of links to related blogs and websites, the blog' s archives, and its search engine. The archived posts (since 2006) are organized by date, title, and category, and the search engine allows you to find all posts containing a keyword or phrase. In the posts themselves, wherever possible, Jenkins not only includes links to websites under discussion but also places video clips directly into the post. For instance, in one collaborative post, Jenkins provides clips of silent films to explain how he teaches his students to think about the similarities and differences between live action and ani- mation, and cinema narration and game narration, while Spanish media scholar Manuel Garin Boronat inserts clips from silent films in split screen with clips from video games (e.g., Buster Keaton and Super Mario) to critique the cur- rent game industry ' s "race toward anthropomorphic realism" ( www. henryj enkins.org /games_culture/). Thus, the blog manages to give readers the advantages of both a scholarly text (one can read, reread, and reflect at one's own pace) and a live multimedia presentation (one can experience the nontextual aspects of what is being analyzed as one gets the analysis). This blog not only offers an introduction to a very di- verse group of intellectuals trying to make a difference in one important area of collective life (how new media tech- nologies will be used), it is itself an experiment in what Jenkins calls "applied humanities." "Confessions of an Aca- Fan" is a very useful resource for anyone working at the intersection of anthropology and media studies. It is also an excellent place to start for anyone who wants to under- stand the potentials and limitations of new media platforms for building bridges between the academy and the public sphere.</page></plain_text>
