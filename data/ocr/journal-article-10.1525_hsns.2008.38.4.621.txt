Perhaps Simon Schaffer will forgive me if I mention that he has described him- self, in regard to his scholarship, as a “singles man.” By this he meant (these were still the days of vinyl) that his characteristic genre of scholarly writing is the article rather than the book. Charles Gillispie, by contrast, has always tended to prefer the longer form. The earliest of the papers in the present collection, however, contemporaries of shellac 78s, remind us that there has always been another side to Gillispie as a historian. Focused essays, each with a point to make and a determined technique for making it, render this collection, to use one of its author’s favorite phrases, “full of interest.” Since 1947, Charles Coulston Gillispie has spent his professional career at Princeton, where he founded the Program in History and Philosophy of Sci- ence (now the Program in History of Science) in 1960. He is therefore a mem- ber of the great founding generation of professional history of science in the United States. No doubt long overdue, the present volume assembles a mis- cellany of his shorter writings to place alongside the books on which his repu- tation firmly stands: Genesis and Geology (1951), based on his Harvard disserta- tion; The Edge of Objectivity (1960); Lazare Carnot, Savant (1971); Science and Polity in France at the End of the Old Regime (1980); The Mongolfier Brothers and the Invention of Aviation (1983); Pierre-Simon Laplace (1997); Science and Polity in France: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Years (2004)—all this besides his monumental labors as editor of the sixteen-volume Dictionary of Scientific *Department of History, 435 McGraw Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853; prd3@cor- nell.edu.

Of all these riches, probably the best known and most widely read is the still-in-print Edge of Objectivity, an undergraduate-level sur- vey of the history of European science since the Renaissance. In a way, it is Gillispie’s frankest statement of his beliefs concerning the history of science, and it has the biographical virtue of representing his views down to the pres- ent day: “If I were re-writing the book today,” he observes in the “Envoi” to this collection, “though I might be able to compose a subtler book, it would not be a different one thematically. It still seems to me that science has exacted a price, and the price is that anthropomorphic considerations of goal, purpose, suitability, and wish be eliminated from its formulations and statements” (410). This is a perspective expressed in Edge, following its similar expression in one of Gillispie’s most celebrated, and best, articles, “The Encyclopédie and the Ja- cobin Philosophy of Science: A Study in Ideas and Consequences” (1959, and here reprinted). Many historians of science find the words still echoing in their memories: science as “western man’s most characteristic and successful cam- paign, which must doom to conquer” (110). Gillispie regards the historical path of science as a tragedy: the successes of science doom what he calls the “sub- jective approach to nature” to ultimate failure, despite the attractions that he has always felt towards Romanticism, to the ultimately “tragic theme” instanced in Blake or Goethe (110–11; see also the reprinted “Science and the Literary Imagination: Voltaire and Goethe” [1972]). He has attributed much the same view to Alexandre Koyré in the latter’s From the Closed World to the Infinite Uni- verse: “The central theme is that of alienation, the alienation of consciousness from nature by its own creation of science” (296; see also 60). So the roman- tic impulse is doomed by the inexorable march of unforgiving science. “For my taste, however, the price is worth paying,” the closing passages of this vol- ume observe (410). Of course, the inevitability and necessity of tragedy make it none the less tragic. One of the pleasures of this book is that most of the pieces are preceded by introductory pages in which Gillispie discusses the context or significances of what follows. He hopes that “having done so does not lend an unduly autobi- ographical character to the collection” (vii). The wish is fulfilled by the fact that the autobiography is certainly not undue; it is what lends such value to the vol- ume, which begins with a retrospective from 1997 on the author’s “Professional Life in the History of Science.” The content and arrangement of the book con- tribute to this aspect: the opening articles date from the author’s earliest days as an English historian—including his first publication, from 1947, “Physick and Philosophy,” on the role of physicians in the formation and early years of </page> <page sequence="3"> HSNS3804_07  10/7/08  2:37 PM  Page 623 BOOK  R EV I EWS | 623 the Royal Society. Gillispie notes of it: “I am still embarrassed by the style” (4). One also learns of the pivotal event that directed his move into French his- tory (besides a piece on Lamarck that stemmed from Genesis and Geology), a Guggenheim fellowship in 1954–55 spent in Paris to investigate science dur- ing the French Revolution. Thus Part II of the collection is devoted to “French Science,” and includes most notably the aforementioned article on Jacobin philosophy of science and one from 1957 on “The Discovery of the Leblanc Process,” itself part of a set of studies on industry and science that stemmed from the Guggenheim year. Gillispie had studied chemistry in college and thought to bring history and chemical engineering together by such a focus, which also contributed to a more wide-ranging essay, on “The Natural History of Industry” (1957), inspired by the craft sections of the Encyclopédie. But the piece on the Leblanc process for making soda (sodium carbonate) from sea salt displays the meticulous scholar familiar from the two volumes on Science and Polity in France. It details the ups and downs of Nicolas Leblanc (1742–1806) in receiving a patent for his new process and setting up a factory out in St. Denis in the 1790s. The greater in- tent of the article, however, is to rectify the mythology that had surrounded Leblanc and his achievements in nineteenth-century hagiographical accounts. By using documents from the Bureau du Commerce, the archives of the Académie des Sciences, and other administrative records, Gillispie debunks the idea that Leblanc was done out of his just deserts by greedy competitors and political misfortune. Leblanc had indeed made the discovery in 1789, and re- ceived a patent for it, but he seems to have been disinclined to do much to ex- ploit it, especially in the absence of requested government financial assistance. What is noteworthy about this article is its meticulous use of archival sources to trace the exact path of the story, as far as it remains reconstructible; such is one of Gillispie’s major scholarly strengths. He has never stood in danger of being accused of mere antiquarianism, however. The moral of the Leblanc story takes the form, in part, of a demonstration of how the discovery of the process was not an example of industry’s debt to science, because a scientific under- standing of the process did not arise until much later. Instead, as “The Natural History of Industry” also details, the relation of science to industry should be seen in this period in terms of congruent intellectual attitudes and outlook, rather than the application of scientific results. There is no ambiguity in Gillispie’s historiography regarding the character of science. Science differs from technology or industry, it differs from any kind of scientistic ideology such as Comtean positivism, and it certainly differs from </page> <page sequence="4"> HSNS3804_07  10/7/08  2:37 PM  Page 624 624 | D EAR politics. Responding at the end of the book to Keith Baker’s criticisms of Sci- ence and Polity, he makes it clear that “in writing of science per se, I have in mind the developing body of knowledge concerning the structure, forces, and condition of nature. In writing of politics, I have in mind the process of gain- ing and exercising the power of government” (406). Acknowledging on the same page that this view of science (and, one could suggest, of politics) might be deemed too narrow, Gillispie remarks nonetheless that from this standpoint, “science and politics are distinct in their inwardness” (406–07). From that start- ing point is the investigation of their indirect relationship to be conducted. Gillispie’s view of science, then, is unabashedly essentialist: “science” is “natu- ral philosophy” rather than “instrumentality,” let alone “technoscience.”1 In keeping with such an approach, Gillispie has long been sympathetic to Robert Merton’s sociology of science—a sociology of scientists rather than of science, as he notes (365); that is how science and polity can be related. A review (chap- ter 18) of Merton’s 1973 collection Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empiri- cal Investigations discusses, there and elsewhere, the impact on him of Merton’s famous paper on “Priorities in Scientific Discovery” (355), a theme that Gillispie admits struck him at first as “unworthy” (356), until he saw how priority dis- putes expressed and were the concomitants of central norms in science. “At the same time,” he notes in “A Professional Life,” referring to more recent socio- logical trends in the history of science, “the emphasis on the practice, rather than the content, of science may entail certain drawbacks. Current authors [not Merton] often seem to lose interest in science once it is made” (xv). The complaint highlights another feature of Gillispie’s work: a concern with internal, technical content. This book contains one of his most celebrated ar- ticles, “Intellectual Factors in the Background of Analysis by Probabilities in Physics” (1962, here more perspicuously retitled “Social Science and Proba- bilistic Analysis in Physics”). Besides resurrecting the significance of Antoine Cournot, this article also alerted historians of science to the likely import of a piece by John Herschel on probabilistic analysis, appearing in the Edinburgh Review in 1850, for Maxwell’s adoption of Quetelet’s techniques in his treat- ment of gases later in the same decade. The formerly “intellectual factors,” nowadays broadened into a less specified role for “social science,” were clearly too broad for some of Gillispie’s colleagues at the “Scientific Change” conference where the paper was first presented. He notes with satisfaction in introducing 1. Peter Dear, “What is the History of Science the History of ? Early-Modern Roots of the Ide- ology of Modern Science,” Isis 96 (2005): 390–406, esp. 401–06. </page> <page sequence="5"> HSNS3804_07  10/7/08  2:37 PM  Page 625 BOOK  R EV I EWS | 625 the article that the suggestion has since become generally accepted among his- torians of physics, even though “it was then thought unlikely, not to say in- conceivable, that a technique could be transferred from social to physical sci- ence” (381). Like the article on Jacobin philosophy of science, such studies might currently be described as “cultural history,” although Gillispie, perhaps justifi- ably, leaves that term alone. Further understanding of his evident attraction towards Romanticism and (what is in fact a related issue) his concern for the essential “inwardness” of sci- ence may easily be gleaned from other essays in the collection. A review of Shmuel Sambursky’s The Physics of the Greeks (chapter 15, from 1958) shows whence came the theme of the dichotomy between continuum and atomistic approaches to nature that structures The Edge of Objectivity: Sambursky’s ac- count of the Stoic pneuma evidently struck a resounding chord. This kind of grand sweep in Gillispie’s historical interpretations clearly never lost its appeal to him, but it becomes less obvious over time. Thus, one of the earliest pieces in the collection is “The Work of Élie Halévy: A Critical Appreciation” (1950), an absorbing discussion of the historian of nineteenth- and earlier twentieth- century England, in which Gillispie approvingly paraphrases Halévy’s conclu- sion that, “whatever the effects of systems of ideas, their formation is to a great extent the product of environmental circumstances” (256). What applies to po- litical philosophy may well be held to apply to scientific ideas. There are many riches in this book, including several essays either not pre- viously published or published only in remote places. They are all worth read- ing. The most recent (“Science in the Eye of the Beholder, 1789–1820”), which has appeared almost simultaneously in a Festschrift for Paolo Rossi edited by John Heilbron, concerns the emergence of scientific disciplines in France in the decades around (and especially after) 1800. This important theme of Sci- ence and Polity is here pursued through examination of contemporary journal articles with an eye toward what may be learned, and what missed, through a determined anti-Whiggish ignorance of what happened later. The answer, in brief, is held to be—significance of events. But the significance of the career and scholarship represented by the older essays in this book can scarcely be overestimated, because we already know what happened later in the extraordi- nary work of Charles Coulston Gillispie. </page> <page sequence="6"> HSNS3804_07  10/7/08  2:37 PM  Page 626 </page> </plain_text>
