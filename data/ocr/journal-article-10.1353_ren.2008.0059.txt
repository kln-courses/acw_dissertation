      <p>For the last fifty years or so, a steadily increasing interest
has developed in the study of the so-called “emergence of a
new subjectivity” in the early modern period. Although the word <italic>subjectivity</italic> has been used with somewhat different meanings
by scholars ranging from Blumenberg to Garin, Greenblatt, Taylor,
and Toulmin, the representation of landscapes has generally been a
major field of inquiry in the assessment of the period’s psychologizing
tendencies. Starting with Petrarch’s “Ascent of Mont Ventoux,”
there has been a number of important studies on the subject (see Karlheinz
Stierle’s <italic>Petrarcas Landschaften: zur Geschichte ästhetischer
Landschaftserfahrung</italic> [1979]). Indeed Renaissance landscapes
lend themselves particularly well to the study of symbolic projections
of the poetic self, and a study of their configurations constitute
a most productive approach to the emergence of an unstable, tottering,
and often poorly articulated expression of early modern subjectivity.</p>
      <p>The fourteen seminar papers assembled in this book by Dominique
de Courcelles, the <italic>grande dame</italic> of Spanish culture
and <italic>directrice de recherche</italic> at the Centre National
de la Recherche Scientifique, represent a worthwhile attempt at circumscribing
the countless interpretive problems presented by the heterogeneous
corpus of literature and the arts in Renaissance Europe. For nature
is never a given, but a fictional construct meant to convey the facets
of authorial selves as they are caught fashioning themselves for the
better or the worse. Hispanic culture is, of course, given the lion’s
share here, as half of the papers deal with Iberian topics and consider
the treatment of “wild nature” in fifteenth-century Castilian
literature and politics (Santiago López-Ríos); the interior
landscape of the soul in Rodríguez del Padrón’s <italic>Siervo libre de amor</italic> (Juan Carlos Conde); the authorial
masked and unmasked virtuosity in Góngora’s <italic>Soledades</italic> (Mercedes Bianco); El Greco’s use of a deformed vision to
affirm his subjective grasp of the world (Lizzie Boubli); sacred elements
syncretistically reinvested into pagan texts of the Andes (Chantal
Caillavet); identity search through birdwatching in Bernardim Ribeiro’s
poem “Menina e Moça” (Helio J. S. Aloes); and,
finally, Spanish mystics’ creative use of landscapes as “natural
magic” to access divine wisdom (Dominique de Courcelles).</p>
      <p>French literature comes second as a field of exploration for self-expressivity
through the depiction of nature. Clément Marot’s “Temple
de Cupido” is reexamined as a parody of allegorical landscape
leading to the author’s spiritual quest (Danièle Duport).
Other sixteenth-century poets with evangelical leanings, like Marguerite
de Navarre, use natural elements as a symbolic invitation to interior
reformation (Rosanna Gorris Camos). Pierre de Ronsard’s famous
roses are seen as flowers of rhetoric meant to enhance the poet’s
claim to creativity (Cathy Yandell). Traditional categories borrowed
from the classics or the scholastics, like the macrocosm/microcosm
figure, are recycled to emphasize human anthropomorphism in Belon,
Rabelais, and other writers (Frank Lestringant). Two papers deal with
Montaigne, either to explore the figure of insularity in the <italic>Essais</italic> (Tom Conley) or the self-appropriating quality of
Italian gardens in his <italic>Journal de voyage</italic> (Philippe
Desan). Only one study touches upon Italian literature with Sannazaro’s <italic>Arcadia</italic> as a wishful dream of harmony between nature and
civilized society (Carlo Vecce).</p>
      <p>To be sure, as in all colloquia of this sort, one might argue with
the choice of speakers or the selection of topics. Yet all the contributions
point in their own way to some hidden side of landscape depiction,
namely its capability for authorial self-representation. In the end,
one wonders if the Romantic cliché once denounced by theorists
as <italic>pathetic fallacy</italic> (“la nature est un état
d’âme”) should not be rehabilitated, <italic>mutatis
mutandis</italic>, as an important component of a rising self-consciousness
as European culture sails toward modernity. One final regret, however,
that will probably be shared by all readers: this collection of scholarly
articles would certainly be put to better use if it contained a bibliography
and an <italic>index nominum et rerum</italic>.</p>
