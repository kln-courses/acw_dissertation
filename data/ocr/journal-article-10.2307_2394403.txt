<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GRAIN AMARANTHS: A SURVEY OF THEIR HISTORY AND CLASSIFICATION" JONATHAN DEININGER SAUER"" Since man first began digging, clearing, and burning the natural vegetative mantle of the earth, certain plant groups have multiplied and spread as others declined and retreated; they have thrived in the midst of the general destruction as weedy followers or cultivated allies of civilization. In the great story of how such plants and human civilizations have consorted, migrated, and evolved to- gether on the earth, the amaranths have played a part which is of uncommon ethnological and botanical interest. For the ethnologist, the amaranths present problems of curiously widespread and ancient culture traits. The plants are firmly entrenched in the religious and economic lives of various Old and New World peoples as wild or cultivated grains, pot-herbs, dye-plants, fetishes, and ornamentals. Insight into their culture history should help in understanding the larger problem of the origin and diffusion of cultivated plants. For the botanist, the amaranths present a problem of strikingly contrasting responses to man by different members of a single genus. Some species have re- mained aloof as unobtrusive wild endemics. Others have moved uninvited into clearings and fields; with the unintentional help of man they have become aggres- sive and widespread weeds. Still others have entered cultivation and become de- liberately propagated wards of man. Insight into the unlike behavior of these different amaranths should help in understanding the larger problem of changes in character and distribution patterns of plants since the coming of man. In spite of its uncommon interest, the story of the amaranths has remained neglected and obscure. Perhaps this is partly because the problem cannot be readily attacked either by a strictly ethnological or by a strictly taxonomic ap- proach. The ethnologist is confronted by near chaos in the classification and nomenclature of this group; he can make little headway until there is clearer definition of the botanical entities which have entered into culture history. The taxonomist is confronted by a dim and fragmentary picture of the relationships of man to this group; he can make little headway until there is clearer recognition of the effects of artificial processes in the evolution and distribution of the botani- cal entities. A combined ethnological and botanical investigation would seem to be the only way to escape from the dilemma. In this paper these two complementary lines of approach will be tried on a limited sector of the general problem. The full story of all the wild, weed, and cultivated species of this genus is much too massive a problem to be attacked here. This paper will focus on the cultivated grain amaranths; even within this restricted *An investigation carried out in the graduate laboratory of the Henry Shaw School of Botany of Washington University and submitted as a thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Washington University.

The grain amaranths are an attractive starting point for several reasons. Of all the amaranths, the grain species seem to have been most closely and most an- ciently allied with man; they have left the deepest imprint on human cultures and received in return the clearest marks of human selection and dispersal. A fund of basic information on them has long been accumulating, both as historical records and as herbarium collections. The few existing general statements of the story have exploited only a small part of this fund and have made no attempt to com- bine botanical and ethnological evidence.

I. HISTORY OF CULTIVATION AND USE The imperfectly known culture history of the grain amaranths will be fol- lowed in geographic sequence through four continents. The trail begins very faintly among the Indians of the southwestern United States, becomes gradually more distinct through northwestern Mexico as the great central Mexican strong- hold of the crop is approached, and gradually fades again in southern Mexico. A small isolated center is found in Guatemala, and a larger one in the Andes extending from Peru through Bolivia into northwestern Argentina. On the other side of the Pacific an indistinct trail runs from Manchuria through interior China to a major center in the Himalayas and disappears gradually into Afghanistan and</page><page sequence="3">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 563 Persia. There is a small outpost in southern India and Ceylon. Finally, there are vague traces of the crop in Africa. UNITED STATES The role of grain amaranths among the Indians of the United States is an un- solved puzzle. The enormous literature on aboriginal cultures contains only a few hints and fragments of information suggesting cultivation of the plants. Caches of seeds identified as amaranths have turned up in various archaeologic sites, such as Snaketown in Arizona (Castetter and Bell, 1942, p. 35) and the Bluff-Dwellings of the Ozarks (Gilmore, 1931, p. 97). The Ozark material was identified for Gilmore by Safford, who ventured no guess as to whether the amaranth seeds were from cultivated plants (Jones, letter'). In his published report on this material, Gilmore surmised that the plants were cultivated, but in 1936 in a letter to Edgar Anderson he wrote that this was doubtful. It is well known that, in recent times and presumably in the past, a great many American Indian tribes gathered wild amaranth seeds along with almost everything else fit to eat in their regions. Unfortunately, the seeds of cultivated and wild amaranths are often indistinguishable, so that the prehistoric seed caches are inconclusive as evidence on the question of cultivation. Volney Jones informs me that all of the archaeologic seed finds he has seen, including the Snaketown material, are so small that they probably represent wild plants. There are some puzzling historical records which report grain amaranths in the Southwest. In 1875 a new species, Amaranthus leucocarpus, was described on the basis of plants grown at Harvard from a mixture of various seeds collected in Arizona by J. W. Powell (Watson, 1875, p. 347). The only information ac- companying the description was that the seeds were used by the Arizona Indians for food. The seeds are light-colored and therefore almost certainly from a culti- vated plant; I know of no example of a wild or weed amaranth with pale seeds. Although Powell had traveled widely in the Southwest prior to 1875 he worked mostly in northern Arizona, so it seems likely that he collected the seeds there. They may have been grown by the Paiutes. Edward Palmer, a contemporary of Powell, wrote (1878, p. 603) that the Paiutes regularly cultivated two species of amaranth, one of which was A. leucocarpus; they called the plants camoot, and made a bread or mush from the meal. Some later writers made cryptic statements that the Arizona Indians cultivated amaranths for seed (Watson, 1880, p. 41; Uline and Bray, 1894, p. 314), but gave no details. Various of the southwestern Pueblo peoples still cultivate amaranths as dye plants but make no use of the seeds (J. D. Sauer, in press). Ethnically and botan- ically, this crop seems to be distinct from A. leucocarpus and will not be discussed here.

He wrote that the heathen idols of the Aztecs were made of a dough of various seeds, milled and kneaded with the blood of human sacrifices (1520, p. 33). Cortes attempted no identification of the seeds included in the recipe, but there is reason to believe that grain amaranths were an essential ingredient. It has been known for a long time that the ancient Mexicans made idols of a dough called zoale and that this dough was made from the seeds of an important crop plant called huauhtli by the Indians and bledo, by the Spanish colonists. The botanical identity of this crop remained a mystery until the 20th century. Gallatin (1845, p. 117) mentioned the crop but was unable to imagine what it might have been. He wrote: "I cannot discover what is meant by guatli. It is interpreted as being semilla de bledo, but I am not aware of any other native grain than maize having been an article of food of such general use, as the quantity mentioned seems to indicate." Payne (1892, 1:354) believed huaubtli was a cereal grass and called it "wheat of Michoacan." Bourke (1892, p. 522) came to the bizarre conclusion that huauhtli must have meant tule pollen. Finally, Urbina (1903, p. 589) and Safford (1917, p. 290) decided that huauhtli was a grain amaranth and most later investigators have agreed with them (Bukasov, 1930, p. 504; Matschat, 1935, p. 26; Martinez, 1936, p. 24; Carl Sauer, 1936, p. 290; Caso, 1937, p. 46; Nuttall, 1937, p. 19; notations by Nicolas Leon in 1938 edition of Sahaguin, 3:338, 364; Anderson and Barlow, 1943, p. 416; Hendrichs, 1945, 1:236). PROBLEM OF BOTANICAL IDENTITY OF HUAUHTLI.- A few recent workers have dissented from the majority interpretation and have suggested that huauhtli was a grain chenopod (Emmart, 1940, p. 321; Hunziker, 1943b, p. 319; Reed, 1944, p. 211). This possibility requires serious considera- tion. At the present time, the Mexicans cultivate some chenopods which look so much like grain amaranths that the two are often confused by casual observers. Modern records of the two crops can usually be clearly separated on the basis of recent herbarium specimens, photographs, and trustworthy field observations. How- ever, the story of these plants cannot be traced very far without leaving the firm ground of certain identification. Many of the relevant modern records and practically all of the older accounts were written by persons who knew little botany and used popular rather than scientific names. Only one of the early accounts (Hernandez, ca. 1575c-see Appendix-D) gave Latin generic names for hImauhtli; unfortunately, it was written before the time when such names had a consistent and definite meaning and in different passages huauhtli was identified as both Atriplex and Blitum, names which suggest both chenopods and amaranths. The occasional plant descriptions in the old accounts are almost useless in identification; some mentioned plant color, but both amaranths and chenopods</page><page sequence="5">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 565 may be green or reddish. The few references to seed color give a better clue. Some of the chenopods and amaranths grown in Mexico today have dull whitish seeds, but many of the chenopods have dull reddish seeds and many of the amaranths have shiny black seeds. I know of no cultivated red-seeded amaranths or black-seeded chenopods in Mexico. Sahaguin (ca. 1570b-see Appendix-C) reported ceremonial use of whitish, red, and black zoale or paste of bledo seed. Pomar's report (1582-see Appendix-F) of two kinds of huauhtli seed, one like a flattened turnip seed and the other smaller and white, also suggests that both chenopods and amaranths were involved. The best clues in the early literature to the identity of huaubtli are the crude drawings; in two 16th century writings (Sahagu'n, ca. 1570a; Hernandez, ca. 1575b). Sahaguin's drawings show definitely that he applied the name huauhtli or rvauhtli' to more than one kind of plant. Some with dentate leaves (pl. 10 A-B) appear to be chenopods; others with entire leaves (pl. 10 C-D) look much more like amaranths. Hernaindez used a single illustration, apparently of a cheno- pod, but his text explains that he considered huauhtli a general term for a group of different plants, some used for grain, some for green vegetables, and some just weeds (see Appendix-D). The Indians themselves probably used the name htauhtli for a variety of plants, grown for different purposes. Some of the compound names may well have been restricted to particular species. Xochibuauhtli (flower buauhtfi) may have meant a chenopod whose inflorescences were cooked in the bud stage as a green vegetable as is commonly done in modern Mexico. Nexhuaubtli (ash huau1tli), like the common Spanish word for chenopods, cenizol, probably referred to the whitish appearance of some chenopods. Tlapalhuaubtli (red buauhtli) might have meant either a red-seeded chenopod or a red-leaved amaranth; similar names are used ambiguously for both plant and seed color by Mexicans at present. Michibuauhtli (fish uaubtli) and tezcahuubthi (mirror huauhtli) probably referred to light- and dark-seeded amaranths, respectively, the former with pale seeds like little fish eggs, the latter with shiny black seeds. Information on these specific plants would be required to determine which were grown as grain crops. Unfortunately, the early accounts ordinarily used the simple name huauhtli with no prefix. Only micbibuaubtli, which seems to have been an amaranth (p1. 10 C), was definitely regarded as a grain crop (Her- nandez, ca. 1575c-see Appendix-D; Pomar, 1582-see Appendix-F). Her- nandez has a rather ambiguous statement which implies that the seeds of tlapal- huaubtli and nexhua'uhtli were also used. There is another approach to this question, beyond the direct but hardly satisfactory internal evidence of the historical records; that is by comparison of the grain huauhtli picture with the distribution, uses and popular names of cheno- pods and amaranths grown in Mexico today. The chenopod enthusiasts rest their case primarily on the cultivated species, Chenopodium Nittalliae and C. pueblense, which they regard as surviving relics of</page><page sequence="6">[VOL. 37 566 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN the once great grain crop (Emmart, 1940, p. 321; Hunziker, 1943b, pp. 319-322; Reed, 1944, p. 211, 1950, p. 139). It is assumed that a modern name, huauhzontli, sometimes reported for these plants, is derived from huauhtli (Robelo, 1904, p. 577). Actually huauhzontli may be a corruption of an entirely different word, cuauhzointli, which can be found in various early and recent writings and which I have often heard given to cultivated chenopods in modern Mexico. In any case, the great weakness of the argument for chenopods as the major component of the ancient buauhtli crop is the poor correspondence between their present distribution and uses and the historical record of grain huauhtli. The ranges of the two overlap, but the coincidence is scarcely impressive. Cultivated chenopods have been found in the Federal District, the states of Mexico, Guana- juato, Michoacan, Puebla, Oaxaca, Vera Cruz, and Tamaulipas (Safford, 1918, p. 524; Reed, 1944, p. 211; collections by Kelly, Carl Sauer and myself). This range excludes various states where &amp;bauhtli was an important crop and includes three states where the ancient grain crop was never reported. The known uses of cuaubzontli bear little resemblance to the ancient uses of grain huaubtli. We shall see that huaubtli grain was commonly prepared for use simply by toasting. Powdered and stirred into water, the seeds made a drink which was considered delicious even by the early Spaniards. Mexican grain amaranths are quite palatable when toasted, but all the cuaubzontli seeds I have sampled have an extremely nasty bitter taste, which is not improved by toasting. They probably contain the same bitter substance present in the Andean Chenopodium quinoa. Quinoa grain is considered inedible when raw and is prepared for use by long boil- ing in many changes of water (Cook, 1904, p. 492). Chenopods are ordinarily cultivated in Mexico today not as grain crops but as green vegetables. The original account of the species C. Nuttalliae (Safford, 1918) reported that the immature tops of the plant were cut when in bud, dipped in batter, and fried. The only cultivated chenopods cited by Reed (1944, p. 211; 1950, p. 141) were used in exactly the same way. These plants have been collected by Isabel Kelly, Carl Sauer, and myself at seven other places in Mexico and in all cases the use was identical. There is one Mexican state in which the seeds of cuauhzontli are known to be used as food. Hernaindez X. wrote me that in Michoacan the seeds of C. Nuttalliae are sometimes milled for tamales, although the plant is normally grown as a green vegetable. West (1948, p. 42) reported that white, black, and red-seeded amaranths are used as grain in Michoacan; all three are planted and harvested together and the seeds separated according to color only after threshing. Both the black and red seeds are usually milled for tamales. West has permitted me to grow his seed collections; of these the black and white seeds were all amaranths but the single collection of red seeds turned out to be a chenopod. West worked in this area in the dry season before planting time and had no chance to observe the plants, but he believes that all the red-seeded "amaranths" may turn out to be chenopods. Outside of Michoacan, grain chenopods seem to be unknown in Mexico today.</page><page sequence="7">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 567 In contrast, the present range and uses of grain amaranths are strikingly like those of grain huuhtli, and the case for amaranths is strengthened by the records of popular names. It seems significant that the early writers consistently identified grain 1ntauktli as bledo, the ordinary Spanish name for amaranths, rather than as cenizo, the ordinary name for chenopods. For example, Sahaguin (ca. 1570b, see Appendix-C) wrote that huauhtli was bledo, but that it was similar to cenizo. He identified only huauhtli polocayo, whose seeds were used as a starvation food, as cenizo. Slight variants of the words huauhtli and zoale have persisted in a few parts of Mexico as names for grain amaranths. In most of the country the name huaubtli has been gradually replaced by synonyms and is no longer applied to any plant.2 The various synonyms can be traced down through the historical records as a continuous chain and finally tied to the present-day names of grain amaranths. The details of the story appear in the following historical review. The indi- vidual pieces of evidence are often ambiguous and fragmentary, but they combine to give a strong impression that most of the writers were recording a single great grain crop, strikingly uniform in names and uses throughout its wide range. In some areas, we can be reasonably certain that this crop was a grain amaranth, pure and simple. In other areas, it may have been a complex of amaranths and cheno- pods, mixed in names, cultivation, and use as they seem to be in Michoacan at present. If so, the two plants have probably been so confounded that their stories may never be disentangled, and we can only hope that the confusion is confined to a fraction of the records. It seems almost inconceivable that plants which have left so faint a trace as the grain chenopods were more than a local and minor com- ponent of the great huauhtli crop. HISTORY OF CEREMONIAL USE.- Pre-Conquest.-The strange idols, great temples, and barbaric rituals of the pre-Conquest Mexicans fascinated many of the early chroniclers, particularly the priests. They gathered a wonderful amount of detailed information on heathen ceremonies and wrote long descriptions which contain much information on cere- monial plants. One of the oldest and most copied documents on Aztec ritual is the so-called 'Ramirez Codex,' which describes the May festival honoring the war god, Huitzilopochtli (Anonymous, ca. 1550, pp. 128-135). The festival was observed throughout the empire, but the chief ceremony was at the temple pyramid in Tenochtitlan, the capital. The whole city attended, all the state and temple of- ficials dressed in ceremonial garlands, feathers, and colored robes, according to rank. The intricate ritual involved dances, processions, singing, much noise of flutes, shell-trumpets, and drums, and human sacrifices in greater number than on any 2Huauhtli means nothing but fish eggs or insect eggs to most Mexicans at present. This two-fold meaning, apparently based on the roe-like appearance of chenopod and amaranth seeds, can be found in the earliest chronicles.</page><page sequence="8">[VOL. 37 568 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN other day. The focus of all the activity was a huge idol of the god made of dough, as large as the regular idol of wood. The temple maidens, two days before the festival, had "milled a quantity of seed of bledos together with toasted maize, and after it was milled, kneaded it with honey, and made of that dough an idol." (See Appendix-B). The idol was carried on a litter in a great procession through the capital and the suburbs and then returned to the temple. At the close of the ceremony it was broken up, with other chunks of the same dough, and all the pieces were consecrated as the bones and flesh of Huitzilopochtli. The pieces were handed out to the populace and were eaten in communion with reverence, fear, and tears. On this day "it was a strictly observed rule in all the land that no other food was to be eaten except that dough with honey of which the idol was made. All those that participated were obliged to give a tithe of that seed of which the idol was made." One of the most magnificent of the early chronicles was written about 1570 by Sahaguin. This Spanish Franciscan compiled a monumental record of the langu- age, beliefs, and ancient customs of the Indians of central Mexico, drawn from years of discussion and collaboration with groups of Indian informants. Over and over again Sahaguin mentioned a ceremonial paste called zoale, or "tzoalli," made of seeds of bledos. Idols of zuale appeared in at least seven regularly scheduled cere- monies and various irregular observances scattered through all seasons of the year (see table i). Most of these rituals culminated in a ceremonial breaking and eating of the idols. Sahaguin confirmed the 'Ramirez Codex' account of a great idol made of zoale for the May festival to Huitzilopochtli, and described an almost identical cere- mony in November: "They took seeds of bledos and cleaned them very well, removing the chaff and eliminat- ing other seeds which they called petzicatl and tezcahuaubtli, and they milled them care- fully, and after having them milled, the flour being very fine, kneaded it into dough of which was made the body of Huitzilopochtli" (see Appendix-C). Sahagu'n identified petzicatl as the black seed of a plant called quiltonilli, which was sometimes cooked for greens. It and tezcahuauhtli may both have been weed amaranths (pl. 10 D-E). Quiltonilli is a common name for weed amaranths cooked for greens in central Mexico at the present time. This reference is of particular interest in suggesting that cultivated buaubtli, like most modern grain amaranths, was pale-seeded and, therefore, readily distinguishable from the dark- seeded weed amaranths. Sorting out the pale seeds from the dark seeds accidentally mixed in during the harvest is still common practice. Zoale was not only used to make the idols of Huitzilopochtli but was also fed to slaves about to be sacrificed to that god. In a final midnight ceremony the temple fire was put out and in the darkness each slave was given four mouthfuls of a soup of zoale (see Appendix-C).</page><page sequence="9">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 569 TABLE I AZTEC FESTIVALS INVOLVING HUAUHTLI OR BLEDO, ACCORDING TO SAHAGUN (CA. 1570) Aztec month Gods honored February 1 2 March April 4-ueytozoztli Chicomecoatl, goddess of crops 5-t6xcatl Huitzilopochtli (Tlacauepan), war god May _ _ ~~~~6 June 7 8 July August 1 O-x6cotlhuetzi Xiuhtecutli, god of fire 11 September 12 October 13-tepeilhuitl Tlaloques, rain gods 14 November 15-panquetzaliztli Huitzilopochtli, war god December 1 6-atermoztli Tlaloques, rain gods 17 January 18-izcalli Xiuhtecutli, god of fire Variable date Macuilxochitl (Xochipilli), flower god Omacatl, god of feasts The fire god, Xiuhtecutli, was also honored by a formal and bloody ceremony, that of xocotlhuetzi. This also involved an idol of zonale, with tortillas of bledo seed on its head, which was tossed down from a tree, with the people scrambling for pieces (see Appendix-C). A slightly later chronicler, the Dominican friar Durain, attributed this festival to a non-Aztec group, the Tepanecs of Coyoacain: "The day of their festival they made a bird of dough of bledo seed which we have called tzoally, which dough perpetually served them for effigy of idols and flesh and bones of their gods, that dough to be eaten afterward." (See Appendix-E). Sahaguin described another annual festival to the fire god in which amaranths may have been used, that of izcalli. All the women made tamales of huauhtli, or huauhquilitl, which they offered in the temple and in home ceremonies and also placed on the graves of their dead (see Appendix-C). These ceremonial tamales may have been made from vegetative parts rather than seeds. Sahaguin identified buauhquilitl as bledos eaten as cooked greens and illustrated the young seedlings being gathered below a mature huuthtli plant (pl. 10 F).</page><page sequence="10">[VOL. 37 570 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN The Tlalocs, mountain and rain gods, were honored by the formal ceremony of tepeilhuitl, by the milder household ceremony of atemoztli, and in irregular indi- vidual offerings when the weather required them (see Appendix-C). In all these rain rites, the centers of attention were anthropomorphic figures of the mountains fashioned of zoale. Sometimes zoale was also made into votive tortillas and smeared on tree roots and branches to represent snakes. Pomar (1582, p. 15) reported similar offerings to the Tlalocs at Tezcoco. In the festival of ueytozoztli, an idol of the crop goddess was made of zoale. All the women presented ears of maize to her for blessing and took them home to keep for seed for the next year. She received offerings of maize, beans, and chia, because "she was the creator and giver of those things that are the sustenance of human life" (see Appendix-C). This ritual is strikingly like one practiced by the Tarascans in Michoacan, far beyond the limits of the Aztec empire (fig. 1). The Tarascans too had an earth goddess who was considered the mother of all the gods and the giver of grains and seeds (Anonymous, ca. 1540). For her festival at Tzintzuntzan, they made little figures of animals, called tuycen, of bread of bledos. When the Spaniards first came, the Tarascans called them gods and they called their horses tuycen (see Appendix-A). Figures and offerings of zoale appeared again during the occasional festivals for the god of flowers and the god of feasts. Some persons mixed the flour of bledo seed with honey and meal of toasted corn for their offerings (see Appendix-C). Finally, there was the new fire ceremony, held at the close of each 52-year calendar cycle. This rite insured the return of the sun for another 52 years; other- wise, the sun and earth would perish and horrible creatures would descend from the sky to devour all the people. A slow procession of priests, dressed as gods, marched to a particular hilltop, followed by an awed and silent multitude. There the new fire was kindled in a midnight ceremony. Torches lighted from the flame were carried by runners to all the waiting villages where people were gathered on the hills and house-tops watching for the first glimpse of light in the distance. When the torch-bearer arrived, everybody relit their fires, all of which had previ- ously been put out. Their joyful celebration culminated in eating "tzouatl, which is food made of bledos with honey" (see Appendix-C). Many other accounts of pre-Conquest ceremonies mention use of buauhtli or bledos (Durain, ca. 1580; see also Appendix-E; Acosta, 1591, p. 234; Torque- mada, 1615, pp. 71-89; Serna, 1656, pp. 320-321, 357; Vetancurt, 1698, p. 86; Bancroft, 1875, 3:323; Bourke, 1892, pp. 523-525; Safford, 1917, pp. 286-289; Seler, 1927, p. 190; Bukasov, 1930, p. 149; Matschat, 1930, p. 26; Martinez, 1936, pp. 27-29). All these appear to be derived, directly or indirectly, from the 'Ramirez Codex' or Sahaguin and will not be discussed here. Colonial Period.-After the Conquest, ceremonial use of zoale was undoubtedly gradually suppressed by the church in its battle against heathenism and idolatry. Stubborn resistance by at least a few of the Indians is revealed by the writings of two 17th century priests. In 1629 Ruiz de Alarcon bemoaned the continuance of</page><page sequence="11">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 571 idolatry in the Atenango district of Guerrero. His Indians persisted in making offerings to the devil with the first fruits of the huauhtli harvest; they milled these seeds and kneaded the dough into little idols of zoale, which they broke and ate in what seemed to the Spaniards a satanical parody of holy communion (see Appendix-H). Similar deviltry near Cumpahuacain in the Valley of Mexico was revealed "by confessions of certain delinquents" (Serna, 1656; see also Appendix -J). In various pueblos some old men retained the office of starting the new fire, and had preserved this great pre-Conquest ritual into the 17th century, com- plete with offerings of "zoales, which is a seed of bledos." Recent.-Shortly before 1900 Lumholtz (1902, 2:47-50) visited the remote Huichol village of Haiokalita in the mountains of northern Jalisco and watched these primitive Indians celebrate their greatest feast of the year. Although he did not realize it, Lumholtz witnessed a ritual which was in some ways strangely like those practiced far off in central Mexico more than 300 years before: "In front of the drum was spread a blanket, and on this a great number of cakes were deposited, shaped to represent animals, such as the deer, turkey, rabbit, etc. They are made from a certain seed, which is ground and mixed with water. The seed, and the plant from which it is obtained, are called wa-ve; being yellow, it belongs to the god of fire. The tribe probably made use of this grain before they had corn. At present it is used chiefly for cere- monial purposes, except when the corn runs short. No one is permitted to eat it until the race is over." The festival culminated in a ceremonial race for life; as each runner finished, he pierced a cake animal with a straw and handed it to one of the elders, who "in eating it secured health and life for all." Wd-ve was cultivated on a small scale by the Huichols and Lumholtz recognized it as a species of amaranth. Farther south in Jalisco, where out-and-out pagan rituals have long since dis- appeared, grain amaranths have slipped into Christian ritual. In the late 19th century Edward Palmer visited an Indian village near Guadalajara and saw rosaries made of little balls of amaranth dough, called "suale", wrapped in maize husks (Safford, 1917, p. 293). In 1947 at Tlajomulco, another village not far from Guadalajara, we talked to a woman who was growing grain amaranths. She and her friends were accustomed to toast and mill the seed to make dough, which they called zoale. They made the dough into little ceremonial cakes and rosaries for something called the Feast of the Cat on December 8th. The Tarascans of Michoacan, who made tuycen of bledo seed in pre-Conquest times, seldom use amaranths in ceremonies today, but in a few villages they make special tamales and atoles of black amaranth flour mixed with black corn meal for the maize planting and harvesting festivals (West, 1948, p. 42). In the heart of the old Aztec Empire, no tangible vestiges of the once enormous ritual significance of huauhtli are known to remain. As will be discussed in the next section, the main modern use of grain amaranths in this region is for alegrias, little cakes of popped seed bound with syrup. These are in large part simply com- mercial confections, but for some reason they become particularly abundant and conspicuous on special saints' days.</page><page sequence="12">[VOL. 37 572 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN HISTORY OF CULTIVATION AND ECONOMIC USE.- The story of ritual use of huaubtli shows more clearly than any other evidence how deeply these plants were embedded in the memories and lives of various Mexi- can tribes. This is only part of the complete picture; beneath the colorful ritual usage lay a massive foundation of everyday practical use of the plants. This usage, not clearly the work of the devil, was largely ignored by the early Spanish writers; fortunately, it was recorded by the Mexicans themselves. Some of the Mexican hieroglyphic codices from before and after the Conquest are still in existence. As their deciphering has progressed, there has been gradual realization that they record not only rituals and myths, but also a great deal of historical fact (Caso, 1949, p. 145). Pre-Conquest.-Some of these records were exploited very early by the native historian Tezozomoc (ca. 1598). His history of the Aztecs before the Conquest undoubtedly involves errors and fantasies, but its credibility probably differs only in degree from most ancient history. Tezozomoc described the centuries of tribal wanderings down from the Northwest until the final settlement at Tenochtitlan. The tribe settled at many places and planted and harvested their crops, often re- maining for many years until their god Huitzilopochtli bade them move on. Even in the earliest legendary times, hutaubtli was among their crops; being light, the seed was carried by the boys whenever the tribe migrated (see Appendix-G). When the tribe settled at Xaltocan, huauhtli was sown in beds in the lake, like the "floating gardens" at San Gregorio Atlapulco in which amaranths are grown today. Acosta (1591, pp. 303-304) recounted another Aztec legend from these early times: Huitzilopochtli helped the tribe pay a crushing tribute, including bledos, to the king of Atzcapotzalco. Tezozomoc narrated mostly events of the 15th century. When the Aztecs conquered the Tepanecs of Coyoacan, the vanquished tribe ran up on a hill and shouted down pleas for mercy, promising all sorts of tribute, including hiauhtli "for your sustenance" (see Appendix-G). During the reign of the first Mocte- zuma (spelled Montezuma in popular English writings) and his successor, Axayacatl, both pale- and dark-seeded hbuauhtli was stocked in the imperial larder and was given as a reward, "with the other things pertaining to the necessities of their houses," to persons who had earned the gratitude of the emperor (Tezozomoc, ca. 1598, pp. 152, 161, 237). Later in the century, huauhtli was stated to be one of the four food crops of the Matlazincas in the valley of Toluca and was sup- plied as food to a Mexican colony at Teloloapan in Guerrero by the neighboring pueblos (see Appendix-G). A wealth of definite information on the Aztec Empire just before the Conquest is available in Moctezuma's tribute list, the famous hieroglyphic 'Matricula de Tributos.' From this document Barlow (1949) has mapped the provinces of the empire and summarized the tribute levied on each province. Huanuhtli was collected from all but three of the twenty provinces which contributed food staples. Each</page><page sequence="13">I v' J vJ SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 573 of these seventeen provinces filled at least one granary with hiuauhtli every year, and some were required to fill two. A single granary is believed to have held about 10,000 bushels of seed (Gallatin, 1845, p. 117; Safford, 1917, p. 286; Bukasov, 1930, p. 149; Anderson and Barlow, 1943, p. 416). Thus the annual levy of these tiny seeds added up to something like 200,000 bushels, a staggering total not far exceeded by any foodstuff. Computed on the same basis, the maize tribute was about 280,000 bushels and the bean tribute about 230,000 bushels. It is obvious from these figures that huauhtli was one of the great basic food crops of the empire. The provinces submitting h-uauhtli tribute cover the heart of the empire (fig. 1A). It may be significant that some provinces in the present states of Puebla and Oaxaca contributed maize and beans but not huauhtli. No significance can be attached to the absence of hiauhtli in the tribute of the rest of the empire, since the more distant provinces did not contribute basic foodstuffs of any kind. Colonial Period.-For a long time after the Conquest, the Spanish chroniclers seem to have completely ignored the more prosaic aspects of this great crop. Nuiliez Cabeza de Vaca (1555, p. 513), who had made a fantastic journey through the far northwest of Mexico in the 1530's, made a puzzling statement that "the coast has no maize and they eat powder of bledo and of straw and of fish." This cryptic remark has sometimes been taken as a reference to cultivated grain amaranths, which have been reported from this general area in recent times. However, it seems probable that in this particular passage Cabeza de Vaca was describing the territory of the non-agricultural Seri tribes (Carl Sauer, 1932, pp. 16-17). If so, the "powder of bledo?' may have been made from wild amaranth seeds. The first definite post-Conquest record of huauhgtli as a crop and everyday foodstuff was made by Sahaguin. There is some evidence that Sahaguin's original manuscript contained an extensive account of cultivation and use by the Aztecs of huauhftli and other crops. This section is not included in any of the available versions of the work. However, in another section Sahaguin reports huauhtli among the staple food crops of two non-Aztec peoples: the Matlatzincas of Toluca and the Tarascans of Michoacan (see Appendix-C). Francisco Hernandez, contemporary of Sahaguin and physician to the King of Spain, spent several years in Mexico preparing a catalogue of its natural history. His completed manuscript has been lost, although modified abstracts of it prepared by Ximenez (Hernandez, ca. 1575a) and Recchi (Hernandez, ca. 1575b) are preserved. Probably the most authentic version, quoted here, is that published by Ortega (Hernandez, ca. 1575c) from the original rough draft, rediscovered in the 18th century. Hernaindez wrote that there were many kinds of plants called hua~ultli, some wild, some carefully cultivated in the gardens of the Mexicans (see Appendix-D). He mentions various long Indian names applied to particular kinds, but makes no clear distinction between them other than coloration. The only use mentioned for most of the kinds was as boiled greens; some of these were probably chenopods, as has already been mentioned. However, from the seeds of</page><page sequence="14">[VOL. 37 574 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN | Provinces giving huouhtli tribute to Moctesuman * Cnters of pre-Conquest ritual use 0 Pre-Conquest 0Colonol records of cultivation ond nse 0Recent ,5 Svh+vrivO A Herbarium specimens 0 S ahuqrip*C'*s . ; ^ACusihuiri cvic / A Giuasvremosv Rurncho Trio, I tiieigiuchic I " * i uirocobvt NN~~~ tgiov Iz,,;,0 - .

Shortly after Hernandez finished his work, the famous relaciones began to appear, in response to the royal inquiry of 1577. These documents often included, among many other things, a listing of local crops. Only a limited number of these relaciones have been published and are available to me, but they show clearly that huauhtli was still important over a large part of Mexico a half century after the Conquest. Huauhtli or bledo seed appeared repeatedly among the three or four standard food crops of particular pueblos; at some it was described as an ancient crop or one which they have "always" had (see Appendix-F). One mention of seeds of "'quilites" probably also refers to grain amaranths; this corruption of an old Nahua word for herbs in general was adopted by the Spanish very early as a synonym for huaihtli (Hernandez, ca. 1575a, p. 235) and is a common name for amaranths in modern Mexico. Most of the relaciones merely confirm the persistence of the crop in the old htauhtli tribute area (fig. 1), but two report huauhtli cultivation far to the southeast at Chila and Guauhtla, along the Puebla-Oaxaca border, and another gives it as one of the two main crops at Xonotla, far off to the northeast, nearly on the border of Vera Gruz (see Appendix-F). Another relacion of this same period, unpublished but quoted by Carl Sauer (1948, p. 75), lists zoale among the major crops at Zapotlan and Tamazula, far to the west in present-day Jalisco. The relacion of Tezcoco reports in more detail the same uses described by Hernandez: dark huauhtli seeds were milled for a dough to be made into tortillas or rolled into little balls, which were wrapped in maize leaves and boiled; the whitish michihuauhtli seeds were used in the same way and also toasted and milled for a sweet drink (Appendix-F). Fifty years later, cultivated hiauhtli was observed around Atenango in Guer- rero (Ruiz de Alarcon, 1629). Here again the seeds were made into little zoale balls, cooked like tortillas, and made into a drink (Appendix-H). Toward the end of the century, Vetancurt ,1698, p. 45) wrote an apparently garbled and secondary account in which amaranths, chenopods, and salvias are confused. This account mentions the same sort of uses and is of interest mainly because it contains the first available mention of the name alegria in connection with huauhtli. The final records available from the colonial period are from far off in north- western Mexico. One document described the crops of the Jovas, who lived near Sahuaripa in Sonora (Anonymous, ca. 1760). These Indians grew a plant, known to them as coguet, to the Mexicans as zoale, which had a pale seed like quelite (see Appendix-K). The seeds were prepared for eating by submerging them in the river in a basket and stamping on them under water until they burst; they were then toasted, milled, and stirred into cold water to make a refreshing drink. The other document is an unpublished manuscript on the isolated Tarahumare pueblo</page><page sequence="17">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 577 of Gueguachic in Chihuahua (Anonymous, 1777). These primitive Indians sowed a seed resembling sesame which they called oguigui and the Mexicans called alegria. It was planted in August in the warm gorges and harvested in November. "When toasted it pops and swells greatly, and is of very good flavor." The popped seed was eaten dry or milled and mixed with water for a drink (see Appendix-L). Recent.-In the 1890's the Mexican government sent out an agricultural questionnaire, which, like the royal inquiry of 1577, requested a listing of local crops. A comparison of the replies to these two inquiries shows that the three intervening centuries brought many changes in Mexican crops, none more striking than the decline of grain amaranths. The replies to the later inquiry cover a great number of pueblos, including some where hnauhtli was a major crop about 1580. Although the crop lists are often quite long, not a single one mentions grain amaranths (Repuiblica Mexicana, Secretaria de Fomento, 1893-1895). Planting and use of htauhbtli was one of the ancient practices which suffered most heavily in the general disruption of Indian cultures. The very importance and ceremonial value attached to the plant in the old days worked against its sur- vival by making it a symbol of paganism in the eyes of the church. The decline of the crop was reflected by its increasing rarity in late colonial records; by early post-colonial times it seems to have disappeared completely from written history. In modern times, with the beginning of intensive botanical and ethnological field work, grain amaranths have been rediscovered in many parts of Mexico. Although reduced to an inconspicuous relic of the once great staple, the crop has been conserved by a surprisingly large number of Mexican communities. Sizeable fields of amaranths are planted by only a few pueblos today; generally a few plants are sown near the houses or scattered through the maize fields; often only a small minority of the families still grow them. A crop grown on such a small scale can easily escape notice, even in a fairly careful field investigation. We occasionally found persons who had patches of amaranths in pueblos where other inhabitants had said, and probably believed, that none were being grown. Although the crop has undoubtedly disappeared in many communities, it probably persists in many more than are indicated by the known present distribution (fig. 1). On a trip through Mexico lasting only a few weeks, we found cultivated amaranths in several areas where they had not been previously reported. Additional field investigation could be expected to round off and fill in the distribution pattern. For example, it is quite possible that there are spots of amaranth cultivation scattered along the almost unexplored western Sierra Madre, which would link the apparently isolated northwestern centers to the main range. However, there is no reason to expect grain amaranths to turn up very far outside the known range; most of the large blank areas on the map persist in spite of traverses by persons interested in the plants. For convenience, the post-Colonial records will be discussed by states.</page><page sequence="18">[VOL. 37 578 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN Federal District, State of Mexico, and Morelos.-Grain amaranths remain a more important crop in this area, the heart of the old Aztec Empire, than in most of the rest of Mexico. Some pueblos continue to make large-scale plantings, mostly to supply the demand for the popped alegria confections. Almost any kind of amaranth seed will pop when toasted, but the kind grown in this region puffs up to an unusually large size, suggesting long selection for this character. The prac- tice of using unmilled popped seeds cannot be traced very far back with any certainty, but the seeds have been toasted and presumably popped for as long as there has been any record, so that selection for popping quality may be very ancient. Detailed accounts of techniques of cultivation and alegria manufacture in the state of Mexico were prepared in the 1880's in response to a government request (Granados, Nogueron, and Zarza, 1886). At that time the crop was grown ex- tensively at Cocotitlain and Temamatla and on a small scale at Ayotzingo. Three different kinds of seed were distinguished: quitlacoche was small and black and was regarded as an inferior wild kind; ojo de pajaro was larger and pale; cacahua- centle was the largest and palest. The name cacahnacentle is shared with a variety of maize with especially large white kernels (Anderson, 1946, pp. 166-167). All three were often mixed in sowing and harvesting. Planting began with the start of the rainy season in late April or May. The fields were prepared just as for maize, but instead of being planted along the bottom of the plow furrow, the amaranth seed was sprinkled into a tiny furrow drawn along the plow ridges with a stick, and was lightly covered with a broom. The seedlings were thinned and the excess transplanted, leaving well-spaced pairs of plants. As the plants grew, the earth was hilled up around them by repeated plowing until the stems were covered to a depth of about 30 centimeters. Bloom began in August, and in late October or November the seed-bearing tops were cut and piled in windrows in the fields to dry. After threshing with horses or by beating with sticks, the seed was cleaned by a series of special screens. The seed was sometimes milled for dough, but the main use was for commercial alegria manufacture. The confections were made from December through May, after which the weather became too damp for the sugar binder to hold the cakes together. The seeds were moistened in a clay pot for a few hours and then spread on a cloth until partly dry before they were toasted. The popped kernels were mixed by hand with partly caramelized syrup and spread on a tule mat; the mix- ture was then compacted "with the greatest violence" into a sheet about 8 centi- meters thick, from which little squares were cut with wooden knives. These cakes were sold locally or in the nearby city of Tezcoco. More recently, the crop was reported a little to the west at Tulyehualco and Milpa Alta (Martinez, 1925, p. 27; Bukasov, 1930, p. 149), and it is extensively grown in this region to the present day (see pl. 11). Cultivation and alegria manufacture remain essentially as described in 1886. However, at San Gregorio Atlapulco the seed is often sown in March in the lowland chinamnpas, the so-called</page><page sequence="19">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 579 floating gardens; thus the plants are well started before the rains begin, when they are transplanted to the upland fields. We were told that the crop is exhausting to the soil and is usually heavily fertilized and rotated with maize. The seeds, almost all pale, are made into alegrias in the individual households; the confections are peddled locally or in nearby towns. Small-scale amaranth cultivation and alegria making are also carried on a little farther north at Chiconcuac and Tultitlan (Kelly, letter) and Zumpango (Hendrichs, letter), and also to the south and west of this region at Chimalacatlan, Tejupilco, Tlatlaya, Tonatico, and Texcaltitlan (West and Weitlaner, letters). At the last three places the seeds are sometimes milled to make dough and atole. Guerrero-Grain amaranths are still sown in the maize fields in the rough mountain country of northern Guerrero, although their cultivation seems to be declining (Hendrichs, 1945, 1:35). Hendrichs wrote me that it is his impression that the custom of sowing a little adegriao has persisted quite generally throughout these mountains. He particularly remembers the plants at Xochitepec and at Iscateupa, where seeds of quelites were an important crop in 1579. The mature inflorescences are cut and threshed on mats; the seeds, mostly pale, are popped over a comarl and milled in a special non-porous metate for atole (Hendrichs, 1945, 1:35). The crop survives in other parts of the state also. Hernaindez X. found a pale- seeded amaranth in cultivation at Chilapa and collected seed which I have grown. At Xochipala pale-seeded alegria is planted in the moist canyon bottoms and the seed is ground and mixed with sweetening to make little balls (West, letter). Weitlaner wrote me that he has unpublished records of alegria or bledo cultivation at a dozen other Guerrero pueblos, two of which lie well to the south of the old huauhtli tribute area (fig. 1). At only a few of these places are the plants care- fully cultivated; usually the plants are sown in the maize fields or in newly-cleared ground; at Tlacotepec the plants are said to seed themselves. The seeds, mostly pale but sometimes dark, are commonly toasted over the comal and milled for atole; alegria confections, sometimes called palanquetas, are made here and there; bledo seed is milled for tortillas at Atoyac. Tlaxcala and Puebla-All of Tlaxcala and much of Puebla were independent of the Aztec Empire and therefore excluded from the tribute list. However, the 16th century reports of the plants at Gueyapa and Chila and their scattered present distribution (fig. 1) suggest an old and once widespread crop. In 1947 we saw cultivated amaranths at the Tlaxcalan village of San Miguel del Milagro. Three plant color forms are distinguished but are not kept separate; all are pale-seeded. The plants are started in January or February in seed-beds protected from frost and are transplanted to unirrigated upland fields, either in solid stands or mixed into the maize plantings. The seeds are harvested in Sep- tember and made into the popped alegria confections, especially for the feast of the patron saint, Michael, on September 29.</page><page sequence="20">[VOL. 37 580 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN In 1948 Hernandez X. collected a predominantly pale-seeded amaranth culti- vated for alegria making at another Tlaxcalan pueblo, San Bernabe Amaxac; he has observed cultivation at several other pueblos in the state (fig. 1). In 1947, travelling south through Puebla, we heard the first rumor of grain amaranths near Huaquechula; alegria was said to be cultivated off in the hills at a village called Santa Clara Tetla. Weitlaner has also heard that alegria is grown near Huaquechula; at a place called Santiago Tetla the seed is said to be accumu- lated in quantity in large baskets and made into a confection, called palanquetas, with caramel syrup or bee honey. Later we found a few people growing pale-seeded alegria for confection-making at Acatlan; they said that the people of Tehuitzingo also grew the plants. The next year Carl Sauer obtained pale-seeded alegria from plants cultivated atTeocuiz- manalco in the northern part of the state. Oaxaca-After the single 16th century report from Guauhtla, Oaxacan grain amaranths seem to vanish from the record until Erwin (1935, p. 661) noticed the popped alegria' confections for sale in the markets of Oaxaca City. In 1947 we found the confections were still on sale in the city markets; they were made locally from seed said to be brought from Ixtlan de Juairez and Zimatlain. The samples we obtained were mostly pale, but a few dark seeds were mixed in. We could find no other trace of the plants on a traverse of the state, but a suggestion that they may be scattered through some remoter areas is given by the presence of amaranth cultivation and alegria making at San Miquel Suchistepec (Hernaindez X., letter). Michoacdn-Here in the old Tarascan Empire, the unrecorded story of grain amaranths may have been much like it was in the better-known Aztec Empire. We know that in the 16th century huauhtli or bledo seed was used ceremonially at Tzintzuntzan and was an important Tarascan food crop. After that the story is lost for centuries until the crop was rediscovered by modern field workers. In its uses and distribution the present crop looks very much like a relic of something more widespread and important. West (1948, p. 42) says: "The cultivation of amaranth is disappearing among the Tarascans; it would probably die out rapidly if women did not constantly remind men to plant it every year." He found that many pueblos which no longer grow amaranths still use the seed, brought in from mountain villages. Cultivation continues in quite a few Tarascan and mestizo villages (fig. 1). Most of these locations are based on West's records and seed collections, which he has permitted me to grow; the only other recent records are from Cherain and Chilchota (Beals, 1946, p. 52; Weitlaner, letter). I looked for grain amaranths in Tzintzuntzan in 1947, but could find only plants grown as greens or ornamentals. The Tarascans distinguish varieties on the basis of seed color; they are mixed in planting and the seeds are sorted by color after the harvest (West, 1948, p. 42). Grain amaranths are known as pari in Tarascan and as alegria, bledo, or qutelite in Spanish (Beals, 1946, p. 52; Rendon, 1947, p. 223; West, 1948, p. 42). The seeds</page><page sequence="21">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 581 are planted in small patches in the house-lot gardens or in the maize fields, par- ticularly in spots where logs have been burned. Sowed in late May, the crop is harvested in November and December; the grain is- threshed from the cut in- florescences in open spaces in the fields and stored in small pots (West, 1948, p.42). The black seeds are sometimes ground with black maize for atole but are mostly used in making tamales, locally called chapatas. These are made from a mixture of black bledo seed, red chenopod seed, and blue or black maize flour; water and sweetening are added to make a dough, which is wrapped in maize husks and cooked in a clay pot (Beals, 1946, p. 52; Rendon, 1947, p. 223; West, 1948, p. 42). Beals also saw chapatas made solely of black amaranth dough and brown sugar; the raw paste was spread on banana leaves and eaten at festivals. The white seeds are mostly popped on a coinal and made into bolitas, sweet confections commonly sold at fiestas, particularly in the mestizo towns (West, 1948, p. 42). Rendon (1947, p. 223) reports that these confections are peddled by the Indians, who make them from the produce of their own plants. Jalisco-In 1886 Edward Palmer found grain amaranths at Guadalajara and collected herbarium specimens which are still available. The plants were culti- vated alone or in the maize fields; the pale seeds were parched and sprinkled with honey to make alegrias to be sold in the city market (Watson, 1887, p. 446). At a nearby Indian village, Palmer saw little balls, called "suale", made from ground amaranth seed and brown sugar (Safford, 1917, p. 293). At about the same time in a more remote part of northern Jalisco, Lumholtz observed small- scale amaranth cultivation among the Huichols. There the plant and its pale seeds were known as "wd-ve." As we have already seen, the seeds were usually eaten ceremonially, but they also served as ordinary food when maize was scarce (Lumholtz, 1902, 2:48). More recently grain amaranths have been reported from Tlajomulco, Tlaque- paque, Zacoalco, (Bukasov, 1930, p. 149), and from Tuxpan (Weitlaner, letter), a town where zoale was a 16th century crop. In 1947 we saw small patches of grain amaranths in house gardens at Tlajomulco. Sown when the rains begin in May, they are harvested in December. The inflorescences are cut, dried in the sun for a few hours and then rubbed between the palms of the hands to free the seeds, which are cleaned of chaff by blowing. The predominantly light-colored seeds are toasted and milled to make zoale cakes; these cakes are primarily cere- monial, as has been mentioned, and are of minor importance as food. Sonora, Chihuabna, Sinaloa-In 1891 Edward Palmer collected specimens of a grain amaranth at Ymala; the plants were called bledos, the seeds "eguaute." The pale seeds were much used for food, particularly when maize was scarce, and the plants were sown or allowed to seed themselves in the maize fields (Safford, 1917, p. 292). Some puzzling amaranths, perhaps representing a grain crop, were collected by Wislizenus at the remote village of Cusihuiriachic, Chihuahua, in 1846. For</page><page sequence="22">[VOL. 37 582 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN some reason, Engelmann planted seed of this collection at St. Louis a year later from which he obtained an additional herbarium, specimen. These collections are accompanied by no data on habitat or use, but the plants are completely unlike any of the known wild amaranths of this region and almost identical to Palmer's grain amaranths from Ymala. In the remote canyons of the Sierra Madre off to the west of Cusihuiriachic, grain amaranths have recently been discovertd by Gentry (1942, p. 108). He collected plant specimens at Guasaremos and Quebrada de Manzana and sent me viable seeds from Rancho Trigo (fig. 1). The plants are cultivated in the house gardens of the Warihio Indians and a few plants are often seen around the houses of the Mexicans (Gentry, letter). The pale seeds are eaten whole or ground into pinole, which is mixed with water or milk, sometimes sweetened, to make a drink. The Mexicans call the plants quelite or bledo; the Warihios call them weywi. Carl Sauer recollects seeing large quantities of bledo or guegui seed stored at Guirocoba, the produce of plants cultivated by the Mayo Indians, neighbors of the Warihio. All the names (oguigui, guegui, weywi, wd-ve) for this crop among the various Indian tribes of northwestern Mexico are probably-merely variants of a single name. GUATEMALA If there are any ancient records of grain amaranths in Guatemala, I have been unable to find them. Even in recent literature, the only published reference to the plants seems to be the single statement that around Cobain the seeds of an amaranth are mixed with brown sugar to make a confection (Standley and Steyer- mark, 1946, p. 154). The crop is practically unknown to everybody except the Indians who grow it. After travelling halfway across the country and questioning not only Indian farmers but also professional botanists and ethnologists, I had drawn a complete blank and was convinced there were no such plants in Guatemala. Finally the ethnologist Rodas, a Quiche Indian himself, told me about cultivation at San Martin Jilotepeque. On the way out there, the bus driver, a part-time farmer who had driven the route for years, assured me that nobody grew any such plants in that area. When I pointed out some of the big gaudy red plants in the maize fields along the road, he stopped the bus to get out and look at them, and was astonished when the local people confirmed my strange notion that the seeds were good to eat. I saw grain amaranths at only three places, in the departments of Chimal- tenango, Guatemala, and Alta Verapaz, and heard definite reports of cultivation at only two other villages, both in Chimaltenango (fig. 2). Two amaranth speci- mens from elsewhere in Alta Verapaz may well represent grain plants. They were collected without information on uses, but belong to races ordinarily grown for grain. One, with dark seeds, was found in a maize field at Cubilquitz by von Tuerckheim in 1903; the other with pale seeds was collected in an unspecified habitat near Secanquim by Pittier in 1905.</page><page sequence="23">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 583 * Recent records of cultivation, and use i A HeTbwrium specimens -------- - - I- -- i II .1 / /~K I / / ~~~~~~~~~~~~A L_/ Te-~_&gt; // I (s AL ASecaftquim, _ A CubiLquitz A ACobr 9 ( A s~ Mar i~~ot p qu I' San JarL sltepequezO , ,i /~~~~~~~~C 0 10 20 30 40 50 KILOMETERS Fig. 2. Guatemala: Localities and regions where grain amaranth cultivation is indicated.</page><page sequence="24">[VOL. 37 584 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN Wherever I saw the plants, I was told that the crop was much more important, grown in entire fields, among the uncivilized Indians far off in some vague areas of the back country. The plantings seen were on a very small scale and made by only a fraction of the people in each village. They said that they grew large quantities only as a catch crop when maize was scarce; usually a few plants were grown in the house lots or in the maize fields. The seeds are often sown in a new burning or in heavily manured ground and occasionally the plants are irrigated. Sometimes the plants were simply allowed to seed themselves from year to year. I talked to one Indian for quite a long time while he was chopping weeds and hilling his maize, and noticed that in several places he carefully avoided disturbing some volunteer amaranths. The plants are generally called bledo in Spanish or some variant of tez in the Maya dialects. Varieties are distinguished on the basis of plant and seed color, but are not kept separate in cultivation. The crop is planted at the start of the rainy season in April or May and is harvested gradually from September to January. Much of the seed is made into popped confections, bound together with brown sugar syrup, just like the alegrias of Mexico. In Guatemala, they are called niguas, the Spanish name for chiggers, perhaps because the seeds look like tiny insects (pl. 12B). The paler seeds pop better and are preferred for nigua making, although some black seeds are usually mixed in. Popping is done in small batches in the huts of the farmers, using the family comal. Sorghum seed is often popped by the same people to make a very similar confection called alboroto, and some hybrid confections include both amaranth and sorghum. During the drier season, when the cakes do not fall apart from the dampness, the people of San Martin Jilotepeque and San Juan Sacatepequez peddle niguas and alborotos quite widely in the Antigua-Guatemala City area. Lots of the people who told me that no grain amaranths were grown in Guatemala had known about niguas all their lives, but they thought they were made from sorghum, like alborotos. In Cobain cultivation is extremely inconspicuous and confections, called jaleas, are made only for home use. There the seeds are usually toasted and milled for pinole. In San Martin Jilotepeque and San Juan Sacatepequez, in addition to making niguas, the people prepare the seed in various ways for home consumption. Although they regard the seeds as healthful and nutritious, they seem to be rather apologetic about these practices; maize obviously has more prestige value. They make the seeds into a gruel or mill them for flour, which, with sugar added, is baked into bread. More commonly, however, they soak the seeds in hot water and grind them into dough for tortillas, alone or mixed with maize dough. White bledo seed is preferred for tortillas, but the black seeds are commonly used, since they are not acceptable for anything else.</page><page sequence="25">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 585 PERU AND BOLIVIA Records of grain amaranths in European herbals are of little value in the case of the North American races; they cannot be recognized in European botanical literature until centuries after the Conquest (Thellung, 1914, p. 236). In con- trast, one of the South American grain amaranths, eventually named Amaranthus caudatus by Linnaeus, entered Europe very early as an ornamental plant. It can be traced through various late 16th century herbals (Thellung, 1914, p. 232), usually with no place of origin specified, until Clusius assigned it to Peru. Clusius apparently obtained some sort of evidence that the species was a South American grain crop; he presents a good illustration of the plant labelled "Quinua, sive Blitum majus Peruanum" (1601, Lib. 4:81). Clusius assumed that this was the same crop as the quinoa found in Ecuador by Pedro Cieza de Leon, which was un- doubtedly a chenopod. This confusion is natural, since the name quinoa has often been used ambiguously for grain chenopods and amaranths and is still applied to both in parts of South America today. Linnaeus (1737, p. 443) cited Clusius in describing the same species and agreed that it came from South America. In contrast to Mexico, the historical record of grain amaranths in the Andes is extremely poor. One reason may be that in western South America the activities and settlements of the Spanish colonists were concentrated on the coast, rather than in the highlands to which grain amaranths are almost invariably confined. Also, in the Andes grain amaranths may always have been a minor and localized crop, easily overlooked or confused with the similar and much more abundant grain chenopods. The tremendous ceremonial role played by hutauhtli in the Aztec Empire was taken over by maize in the Inca Empire. The Inca Feast of the Sun was in some ways startlingly like the Aztec feast of Huitzilopochtli. It too was the greatest feast of the year, held in the capital city with bloody sacrifices and colorful pro- cessions of all the chiefs and dignitaries. Just as in Mexico, the temple maidens on the night before the feast prepared a sacred bread, to be distributed and eaten ceremonially, but in Cuzco the bread was of maize (Means, 1931, pp. 368-372). Thanks to the Jesuit chronicler Cobo (1653), there is one record of grain amaranths in colonial Peru. He distinguished bledos from quinoa and wrote that red and white bledos were "very common food of the Indians, and in the city of Guamanga (fig. 3) very pleasing candies are made of the seed of the white bledos and sugar" (See Appendix-I). Until the present century no further notice of this crop seems to have been taken by anyone but the Indians. Finally Thellung (1914, p. 233) published a report by Spegazzini that the Chiriguano Indians around Tarija in Bolivia culti- vated a white-seeded amaranth under the name of Inca-pacbaqui, or Inca grain; they ate the seeds as meal or grits. In 1915 0. F. Cook collected a pale-seeded amaranth, called quihuicha, in the Urubamba Valley of Peru near Ollantaytambo. Cook later wrote that quihuicha was grown as a seed crop in the temperate valleys around Ollantaytambo and that the seeds popped like Indian corn (1925, p. 36).</page><page sequence="26">[VOL. 37 586 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN -. - .*Pcat\s' '. \% *Santiag'o sde C ucho Ha J8a ar'so __e wd ) "N ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ , \Huartcayo \ OPcsmpcss 0 :AL a\Mejor~ada, -O astrovirroino.

In recent years the crop has been observed by botanists in various parts of Peru and Bolivia. In Peru it is reported at Patas and Santiago de Chucho in Libertad, at Huara's and the Callejon de Huaylas in Ancash, at Huancayo in Junin, at Castrovirreina, Pampas, and La Mejorada in Huancavelica, at unspecified places in Ayacucho and Apurimac, at Anta, Paruro, and Ayusbamba in Cuzco, and at Sandia in Puno (Herrera, 1940, p. 229; Hunziker, 1943b, pp. 338-339; 'Weber- bauer, 1945, p. 619; Pulgar Vidal, 1946, 1:115; Arevalo, Cardenas, and Rick, let- ters). In Bolivia the crop has recently been reported in Tarija where it was first found by Spegazzini, and also in the department of Cochabamba (Hunziker, 1943b, pp. 337-339). Cardenas and Cutler have supplied me with seed collections from Sacaba and Angostura in Cochabamba. Herrera believed the plant was an important ancient, possibly pre-Inca crop of the temperate valleys of Peru, which has declined to a relic in recent times (1940, p. 229). Pulgar Vidal (1946, 1:115) reported that it was an ancient widespread crop of the highlands, "but it is unknown in the city markets, its consumption being limited to the small harvests that each person obtains from the fringes of the maize fields." Other persons who have seen the crop in Peru agree that it is grown only by the Indians in small plantings on the edges of the maize fields (Weberbauer, 1945, p. 619; Rick, letter). Cardenas gives a similar picture for Bolivia. He wrote me that the grain amaranth "is becoming a very rare and odd foodstuff", and later (1949, p. 115) described it as an "autochthonous cultivated species on the road to extinction." As in Peru, the plants are not grown in pure stands, but are sown along the edges of the maize fields. Both the Peruvian and Bolivian plants used for grain are mostly pale-seeded, but some dark seeds are usually mixed in. The seeds are prepared by toasting, parching, or popping; they are commonly eaten alone, sometimes in milk or in stews or mixed with other flour (Pulgar Vidal, 1946, 1:115; Arevalo, Cardenas, Rick, letters). The name quihuicha seems to be used only in the Cuzco area. Elsewhere in Peru the plants are called achis, achita, cizoito, coyo, or coimi; in Bolivia they are called coimi, cuime, millmi or quinua millmi (Cook, 1925, p. 99; Herrera, 1940, p. 229; Hunziker, 1943b, pp. 331-339; Weberbauer, 1945, p. 619; Pulgar Vidal, 1946, 1:115; Cardenas and Hawkes, 1948, p. 31; Arevalo, Cardenas, letters). In both countries, weed amaranths are given a different name than the grain crop, usually some variant of jataco. ARGENTINA In an archaeologic site, believed to be pre-Columbian, at Pampa Grande in the Argentine province of Salta, a funerary urn full of seeds was recently un- earthed. Mixed in with maize, bean, and chenopod seeds were a quantity of</page><page sequence="28">[VOL. 37 5 88 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN amaranth flowers and pale seeds, identified as A. caudatus by Hunziker (1943 a). Since this species is unknown in a wild state, this discovery is good evidence that the crop is ancient in the northwestern Argentine. Cultivation seems to have continued unnoticed by the outside world for many centuries. Finally, in 1897, Spegazzini visited the small Indian village of Amblayo in the mountains of Salta province and was "presented with some excellent little cakes which they said were prepared with Inca wheat of the locality." He took home some of the yellowish seeds and planted them; they grew into amaranth plants different from any known species, which he named A. edutlis (Spegazzini, 1917, p. 163). Since then A. edulis and the Andean A. caudatus, both often grown together, have been found repeatedly as grain crops in the four north- western provinces of the Argentine: Jujuy, Salta, Tucuman, and Catamarca (see fig. 3). Hunziker (1943b, pp. 325-339) gives a detailed summary of previous Argentinian records together with much new information from his own collections. The plants are usually called quinoa or chaclion, but the Andean name coimi is also used in the Argentine province of Jujuy. The plants are cultivated only in small quantities, often in the maize fields, and it has become rare to find even a few plants; "there is no doubt that the days of A. edulis are numbered and that in a little while longer its cultivation will have fallen into oblivion" (Hunziker, 1943b, pp. 328-329). ASIA Ancient History.-In later sections of this paper, we shall see that the Asiatic and American grain amaranths are very closely related and that there is reason to believe that the entire group must have been originally domesticated in America. The question of how long they have been grown in the Orient is therefore of con- siderable interest. The crop is scattered so widely through Asia and is so firmly entrenched among remote peoples that it gives a powerful impression of great antiquity in the area. Many investigators, from De Candolle ( 18 8 3, p. 3 57) and Hooker ( 18 8 5, p. 718 ) down to Ames (1939, p. 39), Vavilov (Darlington and Janaki-Ammal, 1945, p. 14), and Merrill (1950, pp. 16-17), have concluded that the crop has certainly been cultivated in southern Asia from time immemorial and probably originated there. Unfortunately, there is little direct evidence available on the early story of grain amaranths in this area, and it seems unlikely that there will ever be much more. The crop may always have been concentrated, as it is today, in inaccessible highlands, mostly unknown territory to the ancient Oriental writers and early European travellers. The best hope of finding early records would seem to be in India, where the crop is most widespread and important. So far as I know, no one has ever looked in the old Hindu writings for records of these plants. The ancient Chinese botanical sources have been carefully examined by Bret- schneider. It is hardly to be expected that grain amaranths would be recorded in</page><page sequence="29">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 589 these sources, since one can search long and vainly for any mention of them in modern botanical literature on China. Only one definite account of the crop in modern China seems to have been published (Hu, 1948). Therefore it is startling to find that Bretschneider (1896, p. 405) presents what seems to be a clear ref- erence to a grain amaranth in an ancient Chinese materia medica. This work, written about 950 A. D. for the Prince of Shu, modern Szechwan, lists six kinds of hien, a generic name for a group of related plants, mostly indigenous amaranths cultivated as pot-herbs. Among these were two whose seeds were used in medicine; one was called jen (man) hien, possibly because it grew tall and erect. We shall see that there is a modern record of grain amaranths from the same area which gives the same name. Recent.-Since early in the 18th century the grain amaranth species have been collected repeatedly in many parts of Asia (Martyn, 1728, p. 6; Linnaeus, 1763, p. 1406; Miller, 1768, p. 17; Willdenow, 1798, pp. 29-37; and many later sources). However, since these species have become widespread as cultivated ornamentals and occasionally as pot-herbs, their presence does not necessarily indicate cultivation for grain. Many of the collectors noted simply that the plants were cultivated, and there is no way of knowing whether they had found a few ornamentals in an Englishman's flower garden or the staple food crop of the entire region. Such cryptic records are of little value for our present purposes, although they suggest that the grain crop may be grown much more widely than the more definite records prove. The first European to take an interest in the Asiatic amaranths as a grain crop seems to have been Francis Buchanan-Hamilton. In the early 19th century he found the crop in two widely separated parts of India, the far south and the fringes of the Himalaya. South India and Ceylon-Buchanan-Hamilton named the white-seeded south Indian grain amaranth A. frumentaceus. He discovered it "on the hills between the Mysore and Coimbatore countries, where the natives call it kiery and cultivate it for the seed, which they convert into flour and which forms a great part of their subsistence" (Roxburgh, 1832, p. 609). Later Wight (1843, p. 720) wrote of A. frumentaceus: "In Coimbatore, Salem, and Madura I have frequently met with large fields of it, often on very steep slopes. The seed ground into meal forms the principal food of the wild inhabitants of these hills." Sykes (1838, p. 241) may have been referring to the same plant and the same area when he listed, among the crops of the Deccan, an amaranth called rajgeerah whose seeds were harvested in December and eaten unmilled. The crop has persisted in these hills into the present century. In 1912 the U. S. Department of Agriculture received seeds of a grain amaranth from the Mysore area (Safford, 1917, p. 297). Finally, Fisher (1921, p. 147) reported that on the Anaimalai Hills at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000 feet the hillmen cultivated a grain amaranth called kira.</page><page sequence="30">[VOL. 37 590 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN There are vague reports, with no details given, of cultivation of amaranths in Ceylon for the grain, locally called landesi (Hooker, 1885, p. 718; Church, 1886, p. 107; Trimen, 1895, p. 396). North India-Buchanan-Hamilton gave the name Amaranthus Anardana to the white-seeded plants he found cultivated in the fields of Nepal, Bhagalpore, and Cosala, modern Oudh (Wallich, 1828, No. 6903; Madden, 1858, p. 118; Haines, 1922, p. 1247). In his notes he also mentioned that one of the chief crops high in the hills of Kullu was a plant called chuya, which he had not seen but believed to be a grain sorghum (Madden, 1858, p. 118). Madden believed that chutyad and anardana were one and the same thing, and that anardana was an incorrect render- ing of amardana, as Buchanan-Hamilton once wrote it, meaning immortal grain. He had seen this tall crimson or yellow amaranth cultivated "all over the Himalaya" under various local names, including ramdana, grain of the god Rama. The names given this crop in different regions of the Himalaya are bewilderingly variable and will not be catalogued here; many, such as bathu and sag, are generic terms applied not only to grain amaranths but also to chenopods and the various indigenous amaranths used as pot-herbs. Later records show that grain amaranths are scattered widely across northern India and the neighboring states. Occasionally they are grown in the plains regions as an irrigated crop during the dry winter monsoon (Watt, 1908, p. 63; Bamber, 1916, p. 314). Little precise information is available on distribution of the crop in the lowlands. Kashyap, (1936, p. 205) reports them around Lahore in the Pun- jab. White-seeded specimens of species commonly grown for grain have been re- ported in cultivation at Manbhum, Singbhum, and Sambalpur (Haines, 1922, pp. 761-762), but the purpose for which they were grown was not stated. In these plains areas the crop seems to be grown only on a very small scale along field borders, and the grain has a minor use as one of the foods permitted Hindus on their fast days. Behind the plains, in the foothills and mountains of the Himalaya system, amaranths become an important field crop and a conspicuous feature of the land- scape. They have been recorded repeatedly along the whole length of the Himalaya from Kashmir to Bhutan. Important early collections of grain amaranth species were made in Baltistan, Hazara, Kashmir, and Ladak by the Schlagintweit Tibetan expedition of 1856. The available herbarium specimens bear no data on uses, but Thellung reported that one of their collections, at least, was known to come from plants cultivated for the seeds, which were ground into meal (1914, p. 243). Subsequently, cultivation of amaranths as grain crops has been reported in Kashmir, Chamba, Sirmur, especially around Simla, in Bashahr, Tehri, Garhwal, Kumaon, specifically in the Bhotiya and Almora regions, in the mountain tracts of Oudh and Bengal, and in Sikkim (Powell, 1868, p. 244; Watt, 1885, pp. 210-211; Church, 1886, p. 107; Duthie, 1893, p. 24; Lawrence, 1895, p. 338; Gammie, 1898, p. 184; Collett, 1902, p. 411; Bamber, 1916, p. 314; Pant, 1935, p. 46; 83; Millen, letter). Watt also reported the crop in the hills of Burma (1908,</page><page sequence="31">U | 9 ~~~~/ OUDH }~ '; &lt;&lt;\ HUPEH 2 .

He has heard that they are grown as a grain crop on the Bhutan border by a Tibetanized tribe. In Nepal there seems to have been no record of the crop since the time of Buchanan-Hamilton and Wallich until 1948, when Dr. Janaki-Ammal found amaranths cultivated as a grain crop near Sirsagarhi in the Marku Valley. She obtained samples of both pale- and dark-seeded kinds, which I have been able to grow. Throughout the Himalaya, the crop is planted in unirrigated land at the begin- ning of the rainy summer monsoon in May or June and is harvested from Septem- ber on (Watt, 1885, pp. 211-212; Church, 1886, p. 107; Duthie, 1893, pp. 23-24; Lawrence, 1895, p. 338; Watt, 1908, p. 63; Pant, 1935, p. 84; Millen, letter). The amaranth is a favorite crop in newly burned and cleared jungle, as it is not easily injured by wild pigs, bears, and deer (Watt, 1885, p. 211; Pant, 1935, p. 83) . In the Valley of Kashmir, it is a relatively minor crop, as in the plains, sown in rows among the cotton fields or on the borders of the maize plots (Lawrence, 1895, p. 338). Around Tehri it is grown in little plots near the houses (Millen, letter). It is planted more extensively as a regular field crop higher in the Himalaya, often at elevations up to 2500 or 3000 meters (Hooker, 1885, p. 718; Watt, 1885, p. 211; Church, 1886, p. 107; also many later writers). Pant (1935, pp. 40-46, 84) gives a fascinating account of the precarious agriculture practiced by the Mongoloid nomads around Milam on the Tibetan frontier of, Kumaon. The area is too high for permanent habitation. It is covered with six to twelve feet of snow for over half the year and the growing season is only about four months long. Crops are raised by primitive hoe cultivation in tiny steep plots studded with glacial boulders; the boulders aid growth of the plants by storing the sun's heat. The crops are always stunted, and often ruined by persistent mists or avalanches; sometimes they are buried by early snows before they can be har- vested. In spite of these tribulations, the people sow and usually reap barley, buckwheat, and grain amaranths, sometimes at elevations of more than 3500 meters. The Himalayan plants, like the Latin American ones, are rich and variable in color; their striking coloration is partly responsible for what little attention they have received in the available literature. Madden (1858, p. 118) was enthusiastic about the brilliant crimson and rich yellow of the plants: "The effect of a moun- tainside, terrace above terrace, covered with distinct fields of these colours, and glowing under the rays of the afternoon sun, is gorgeous indeed." Lawrence (1895, p. 338) described the amaranth as "the most beautiful of all the crops, with its gold, coral, and crimson stalks and flowers." Gammie (1898, p. 184) wrote that the amaranth, "with its ample red and yellow panicles, brightens the landscape, and its fields of vivid hue serve to mark the positions of widely scattered hamlets among the valleys, miles away from the traveller's standpoint."</page><page sequence="33">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 593 Many of the writers give more space to the esthetics than to the uses of the crop, particularly since the grain does not enter into commerce. "Visitors to the hills of India are inclined to smile at people who live very largely upon these minute seeds" (Watt, 1908, p. 63). Around Tehri the grain is popped and made into a dough which is patted between the palms of the hands to make thin cakes (Millen, letter). In Nepal the grain is roasted and eaten as balls like popcorn, held together by sugar syrup (Janaki-Ammal, letter). There are a few reports that the seeds are parched, ground to flour, and eaten as a gruel with milk or water (Watt, 1885, p. 210; Lawrence, 1895, p. 338; Pant, 1935, p. 46). Beyond that there are only such general statements as: this grain is "one of the most important sources of food to the hill tribes of India" (Watt, 1885, p. 211). Afghanistan and Persia-Referring to western Afghanistan and the Khorasan area of Persia, Atkinson (1891, p. 10) wrote: "The amaranth, taj-kharus, occurs only as a cultivated plant, usually seen thinly scattered through melon and tobacco fields, both the red and yellow flowered varieties. I never met with what I should consider a regular crop of the plant, but it occurred through fields rather as if the natives held, in superstitious veneration, the necessity of growing a few of these plants sparsely spread through their fields. The seed is eaten cooked." China and Manc/wtria-Shiu-ying Hu (1948, pp. 32-34) wrote that an amaranth is cultivated in western China: . as a supplementary crop in corn or cotton fields to fill in the spaces where young plants may have been destroyed by insects or along the margin of the field. The plant often grows to a man's height and is thus called manly shien. The crop is harvested when the leaves on the lower two thirds of the stem turn yellow. After the plants are gathered and dried in the sun, they are threshed." The seeds are known as tien-shu-tze, or millet from heaven; they are popped and mixed with a hot sugar syrup made from fermented rice or millet grain. When the mixture cools, it is "cut into thin slices. This candy is crisp, puffy, sweet and well flavored. On the Chinese New Year's Eve, in every farm-house quantities of such candy are made." The Chinese characters on Miss Hu's illustration of manly shien are identical to those given for man hien in Szechwan in the loth century (Bretschneider, 1896, p. 405). Miss Hu did not specify the parts of western China in which the crop is grown, but she suggested that I write M. C. Chang at Chengtu for definite information. Chang informed me that grain amaranths are not grown near Chengtu but in far-off mountain areas. He sent me samples of light- and dark-seeded tien-shz-tze, grown at elevations of 2000 or 2500 meters near Mowhsien in northwestern Szechwan and Muping in Sikang. The crop is probably also present to the southwest of Szechwan in Yiinnan; amaranths are reported extensively cultivated on the upper Mekong above Weisi and also around Tali (Handel-Mazzetti, 1929, 7:162). The fields are said to "appear generally red" from these plants. Although no mention of use is made, it is hard to imagine such large-scale cultivation as anything but a grain crop. It is conceivable that the crop may extend almost continuously through these poorly known parts of interior Asia from Szechwan to the Himalaya.</page><page sequence="34">[VOL. 37 594 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN - On the other side of Szechwan, the trail is not much clearer. Pale-seeded forms of species ordinarily grown for grain have been collected in cultivation in Kweichow and Hupeh, but with no data on use. Small-scale cultivation of amaranths for their edible seeds has been noted in Honan and Hopeh (Hsien-wu, 1935, p. 11; Beach, letter), but no details are available. These indistinct traces of the crop, extending across so much of the interior of China, finally come to an end in Manchuria. A pale-seeded cultivated amaranth belonging to a grain species was collected in the Hsiaoling area of southern Man- churia by Dorsett in 1925. In northern Manchuria there is a definite account of grain amaranth cultivation (Skvortzow, 1926, p. 15). The crop "is planted in fields by the Chinese for the sake of its small yellow or reddish seeds, which are used in the preparation of little cakes." AFRICA Baker and Clarke (1909, p. 32) claim that amaranths are "cultivated through- out warm Africa as a grain." This statement may be an exaggeration based partly on simple records of occurrence of grain amaranth species. In Africa, just as in Asia, some of these species have been widely diffused as garden ornamentals; oc- casionally they are also cultivated as pot-herbs. I am unable to find any confirma- tion of grain use of the plants in Africa, except for Dalziel's statement that in Sierra Leone an introduced amaranth "is said to be cultivated for the seed as food" (1948, p. 36). II. BOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION So far, in tracing the culture history of the grain amaranths, the problem of their botanical classification has been postponed and species identifications given in the literature have been deliberately ignored. The Latin names given the plants by different authors are bewilderingly variable. They include, for the grain amaranths of Arizona: caudatuts, leucospermus, leucocarpus, Powellii, and retro- flexus; for those of Mexico: caudatus, cruentus, hybridus, leucocarpus, leuco- spermus, and piaiziculatus; for those of South America: caudatus, edulis, and leucospermtus; for those of Asia: Anardana, caudatus, celosioides, cruentus, farina- ceus, flavus, frumentaceus, hybriduts, hypochondriacus, paniculhtus, sanguineus, speciosus, and strictus; and for those of Africa: Alopecuirus and caudatus. Con- flicting identifications are not confined to older sources but continue in recent literature and current herbarium determinations. A little investigation of the published descriptions of these many "species" immediately reveals one important fact: all belong to a closely related group, forming a relatively small section of the genus Amaranthus. This section, usually called AMARANTHOTYPUS, is distinguished by having monoecious compound in- florescences and 5-merous flowers with circumscissile utricles (Dumortier, 1827, p. 19; Moquin-Tandon, 1849, p. 255; Thellung, 1914, p. 230). Beyond this single fact, very little sense can be made of the classification of the grain amaranths from a study of the literature. The section AMARANTHOTYPUS is outstanding, even in</page><page sequence="35">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 595 the genus Alnaranthus, for its labyrinth of disputed synonymy and controversial taxonomy. The confusion is mostly traceable to two factors: the wide dispersal of the species and the subtlety of the differences between them. Their wide distribution is not due solely to their spread as grain crops; the grain species and their close relatives include most of the cosmopolitan ornamental and weed amaranths. Since there has been nothing approaching an adequate general treatment of the genus until the present century, the naming of amaranths has been almost entirely in the hands of persons working on local floras. It was inevitable that such widespread species would receive different Latin names in different regions. The result has been a rich heritage of problems in nomenclature. The second factor responsible for the confused classification has created a much more serious problem than the superfluous names. Species differences within the section are mostly quantitative and often easier to recognize than describe. Most of the earlier species descriptions are excessively brief and waste their few words on characters common to many species or such trivial characters as pigmentation. Before the extreme importance of flower characters was realized, the damage had been done. The species had been described and named, according to the rules, but many were completely unrecognizable from the original descriptions. Since access to many of the type specimens has been difficult or impossible for most botanists, it is small wonder that concepts of the species have become highly variable. The obvious solution to these difficulties would be monographic treatment, a formidable project which no one has yet attempted. The closest approach was made by Thellung in his treatment of Amaranthus for a flora of Europe (1914). Thellung's work is an admirable piece of scholarship, based on careful herbarium study, emphasizing microscopic flower characters, and on exhaustive bibliographic research. Unfortunately, the purpose of the work required Theilung to concen- trate his attention on the European flora, which has few native amaranth species. He concluded that all the species of AMARANTHOTYPUS present in Europe are recent immigrants, none of which arrived before the 16th century. The specimens he worked with consisted mostly of adventive weeds and a jumble of cultivated plants, often hybridized and usually of forgotten origin, which had been propa- gated for generations in European gardens. Considering these fantastic handicaps, Thellung's insight into the group was remarkable. His reduction of over forty "species" of AMARANTHOTYPUS to five and his detailed descriptions of the entities, often based on re-examination of Linnaean types, represent great forward steps. There have been two important taxonomic works involving this group since Thellung's work. Standley's treatment of the genus for the 'North American Flora' (1917) is particularly useful for the North American endemic species; his systematic treatment of the section AMARANTHOTYPUS is little more than a simpli- fication and modification of Thellung's treatment. Hunziker's morphological in- vestigation of the grain amaranths (1943b), is also of considerable value, par- ticularly for the South American crop plants, on which most of his work was done.</page><page sequence="36">[VOL. 3; 596 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN The best hope for fuller understanding and more convincing classification would seem to lie in a study of the entire section throughout its range. A start on this ambitious project is attempted here. METHOD OF INVESTIGATION The procedure adopted was to put aside all the conflicting identifications, both in published literature and on herbarium sheets, and make a fresh start by re- examining individual specimens. Specimens of the cultivated grain amaranths were mostly obtained by growing seed collections from many different sources in the New and Old World. Half a dozen to a dozen plants were grown from each seed sample in various greenhouse and outdoor plantings, both in Missouri and in Cali- fornia. I was able to make some field collections of non-cultivated amaranths in the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala. However, most of the wild and weed amaranths examined, as well as a few of the grain amaranths, were obtained from the collections of four herbaria: the U. S. National Herbarium, the Gray Her- barium, the University of California Herbarium, and the Herbarium of the Mis- souri Botanical Garden. Material examined from these institutions included their complete collections of the section AMARANTHOTYPUS from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, and a sampling of their collections from the United States. The specimens examined are listed on pages 620-623. A limited amount of material from Europe was examined, but is not included in the presentation, since the grain species and their close relatives are present in Europe only as recent immigrants. I had originally hoped that chromosome counts might be of some help in classi- fication. The few published counts indicate that there are two groups of species in the section AMARANTHOTYPUS, one with a diploid chromosome number of 32, the other with 34 (Takagi, 193 3, p. 556; Murray, 193 8, p. 317). I prepared root- tip sections of several species and obtained counts in the low 30's for all of them. In my preparations it was very difficult to obtain precise counts; the apparent num- ber of chromosomes varied considerably between different cells of a single section. I suspect that other persons have had the same difficulty. For example, Takagi reported a diploid number of 32 for A. caudatus; in 1948 Dr. Cairdenas wrote me that he had found the diploid number in both A. caudatus and its wild relatives in Bolivia to be 32, but in a later publication (Cardenas, 1949, p. 114) he reported counts of 34 for these same species. I am not convinced that the reported vari- ations in chromosome number actually exist. In any case, the numbers are too difficult to determine in this group to be of much use in classification. It seemed best to rely entirely on morphological characters, at least in this preliminary attempt at classification. Major attention was given to the morphology of the flowers, which were ex- amined under a low-power dissecting microscope. There is always much variation between flowers on an individual plant, so that characterization by examination of one or a few flowers is unsafe. When a sufficiently large number of flowers is examined, a single reasonably constant type can be distinguished, which appears over and over again among the many other inconstant and non-repeating variants.</page><page sequence="37">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 597 The abundance of flowers on an individual amaranth is one of the few consolations in studying this generally unattractive plant. Mature flowers of each specimen were scored for about two dozen different items, involving number, size, and shape of all parts. Exact scale drawings were made of all specimens that appeared even. slightly different from ones previously drawn. By means of such sketches several characters which have not received much previous attention are seen to be of distinct diagnostic value (see figs. 5 and 6). An attempt was made to score macroscopic characters, particularly configura- tion of the inflorescence, but these proved to be of little value in classification. Such characters are difficult to measure or express objectively and are extremely dependent on the age of the plant and on environmental variables. When examination and scoring were completed, it was found that the great majority of the available specimens could readily be sorted, on the basis of flower characters alone, into a few reasonably homogeneous groups. It then became evident that the vague and largely subjectively appreciable differences in vege- tative characters and inflorescence aspect fitted these groupings quite well. Finally, an attempt was made to determine the correct names for the major entities recognized; no attempt was made to give Latin names to the lesser entities. Where type specimens are not available, I have tried to do the least possible violence to existing species concepts, particularly those of Thellung and Standley. Stand- ley's numerous herbarium determinations are outstanding for their consistency among the ruck of carelessly given names. The following sections outline the distributions and the more distinctive char- acteristics of the entities recognized. Unless otherwise stated, the geographic distributions are based entirely on specimens examined. The grain species are con- sidered first, followed by the closely related wild and weed species. GRAIN SPECIES The cultivated grain amaranth species are so very much alike, not only in appearance but in many technical characters, that the prevailing confusion is not at all surprising. All are coarse annual herbs with similar leaves and branching habit, erect and tall, sometimes growing higher than a man. The obvious plant and seed color differences, which have been used as varietal or even specific char- acters by too many botanists, are of little taxonomic value. Amaranthus edulis plants apparently always lack red pigment and are always pale-seeded, but each of the other three species has dark- and pale-seeded forms, and in plant color each varies from deep red to bright green. These color characters seem to be freely exchanged within an otherwise homogeneous population and are commonly highly variable in a single seed lot. All the grain amaranths characteristically have great compound inflorescences, terminal on the main stem and side branches. The basic units of the inflorescence are little dichasial cymes, usually called glomerules, each ordinarily consisting of an initial staminate flower and an indefinite number of pistillate flowers.

When grown under unfavorable day- length conditions, the plants begin to bloom when only a couple of inches high and manage to produce only a simple small terminal spike. When grown under proper day-length conditions, all of the grain species are capable of putting forth a huge inflorescence, with a large terminal spike and fifty or a hundred lateral spikes, which may themselves bear branch spikes. In all the grain species each flower is subtended by a sharp-pointed bract (fig. 5); the perianth consists of five free tepals; the male flowers characteristically have</page><page sequence="39">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 599 five stamens, the female a single circumscissile utricle. Within this common frame- work, the following entities can be recognized. Amaranth-its leucocarpus S. Wats.- This species was originally described by Watson (1875, p. 347) on the basis of plants grown from a single seed lot, obtained in Arizona by J. W. Powell. So far as I know, the species has not subsequently been collected in Arizona, but very similar plants have been widely collected elsewhere, particularly in Mexico. As defined here, the species is divided into races, with the type collection of the species assigned to the Arizona race. The more common and widespread race differs slightly from Watson's type, but includes Mexican specimens identified as A. leuco- carpis by Watson himself (1887, p. 446). The species name was poorly chosen, since it was the color of the seeds, rather than the color of the fruit, which at- tracted Watson's attention. He later (1887, p. 446) attempted to change the name to A. leucospermus, but under the rules this later synonym is illegitimate. In published works, A. leuc-ucarpuns is commonly reduced to a variety or synonym of either A. cazudatus L. or A. hybridus L. Herbarium specimens of this group are commonly identified as either A. paniculatus L. or A. hypocho-ndriacus L. There are morphological and geographical arguments against identifying the group which includes Watson's type with any of these Linnaean names. However, it is quite possible that A. leucolcarpus may eventually prove to be a synonym of some other early name. For example, Wight's illustration (1843, p. 720) of A. fruinentaceuts Buchanan-Hamilton suggests that this poorly known species may be identical to A. leucocarpjts. In the meantime, it is expedient to retain Watson's epithet, as it is the only one in common use which can definitely be tied to this distinctive group of amaranths. Common Race of A. leucocarfts.-This race is perhaps more widespread and important as a grain crop than any other amaranth and also includes one of the common ornamental forms, sometimes known as Prince's Feather. As a grain crop its known distribution includes many places in Mexico: Guasaremos and Rancho Trigo in Chihuahua (see fig. 1), Quebrada de Manzana in Sinaloa, Guadalajara and Tlajomulco in Jalisco, Teremendo and Opopeo in Michoacain, San Gregorio Atlapulco and nearby villages in the Distrito Federal, Amaxac and San Miguel del Milagro in Tlaxcala, Teocuizmanalco in Puebla, Chilapa in Guerrero, and Ixtlan de Juairez in Oaxaca. The specimen from Secanquim in Guatemala, previously mentioned as probably representing a grain crop, also belongs to this race. In Asia the race has been collected in Iran and Afghanistan; in many regions of the Himalaya: Baltistan, Hazora, Kashmir, Ladak, Chamba, Bashahr, Sirmur, Garhwal, Kumaon (labelled A. Anardana), Nepal, and Sikkim; in various provinces of China: Sikang, Yfinnan, Kweichow, Szechwan, Hupeh, Kiangsu, and Shantung; and in Manchuria. Many of these Asiatic specimens bear the simple notation "cultivated" or "crop" but almost none are accompanied by any information on the purpose for which they are grown. Only the specimens grown from seed collected for me in Nepal by Dr. Janaki-Ammal are positively</page><page sequence="40">l VOL. 37 600 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN identified as a grain crop. However, the distribution pattern of this race in Asia coincides strikingly well with the area of grain amaranth cultivation reported in the literature. As an ornamental the race is widely grown in Europe and the United States. The only available African specimen is from Morocco and may represent an orna- mental brought from Europe. Outside of cultivation, the race has been collected only as an infrequent escape at widely scattered places in the United States, Mexico, Asia, and Europe. The mature inflorescences of this race are remarkable among the cultivated amaranths for their stiff appearance (pl. 13A). Both terminal and lateral spikes are usually long and thick and often erect. The bracts are especially large and long-pointed, giving the inflorescence a prickly appearance. The tepals also are longer than in the other grain amaranths, slightly recurved, and usually acute- tipped (fig. 5). The utricle cap is large and slopes gradually to the extremely thick bases of the recurved style-branches, which usually meet in a sharp cleft. The Mexican populations are overwhelmingly pale-seeded, although several have a small proportion of dark-seeded forms mixed in. In the Asiatic collections dark- seeded plants are more numerous but still in the minority. The plants grown as ornamentals in Europe and the United States seem to be invariably dark-seeded. There is minor but definite variation in flower characters within and between many of the Mexican collections. Some members of the Gaxaca and Guerrero collections show some resemblances to the Mexican race of A. cruentits, described below. All of the United States and Old World collections examined are virtually identical in flower characters and are exactly like some of the Mexican plants. Arizona Race of A. leucocarpts.-This race is known only from the single 19th-century seed collection from some mysterious Arizona Indian tribe. All the available specimens were grown at the botanical garden of Harvard University. The vegetative characters and inflorescence aspect (pl. 13B) of the plants were probably marked by this exotic environment. The less plastic flower characters are very similar to those of the preceding race, except that the parts are all notice- ably smaller and the style-branches less thick (fig. 5). The three available speci- mens are all pale-seeded. Aberrant Race of A. ieitcocarpus.-One of the Mexican grain amaranths is quite unlike any recognized species. It seems best not to give it a Latin name until it is more adequately collected and understood. It is placed here provisionally, since it is grown within the range of A. leucocarpus and may be nothing more than a cross between it and some other very dissimilar species. This race is known only from Dr. West's collection from Los Reyes in Michoacain, where it is cultivated as a grain crop. The inflorescences (pl. 13C) are much like those of the common race of A. leucocarpus, but the flowers are completely different. The stamen and tepal num- bers vary between 4 and 5 in an individual inflorescence. The bracts hlave a narrow lamina and an extremely long point, while the tepals are greatly reduced in size</page><page sequence="41">19501 SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 601 and often without visible nerves. The utricle cap is very rugose and flattened and the style-branches are extremely short. There is only minor variation between the half dozen plants of West's seed collection that I have grown. All are dark-seeded. Arnaranthius cruentus L.- Linnaeus described this species from Chinese plants (1759, 2:1269). His ambiguous description was clarified by Thellung (1914, p. 243) after re-examina- tion of Linnaeus' material. There can be little doubt that the species under con- sideration here is the same as Linnaeus' A. cruentus. The plants included here which were determined by Standley are consistently labelled A. cruentus. Never- theless, other taxonomists have given this species a variety of other names in her- baria; many of the Asiatic specimens have been labelled A. paniculatus L., a name reduced to synonymy with A. cruentus by Thellung and Standley. Common Race of A. cruentus.-This group is known as a grain crop only at three places in Guatemala: San Martin Jilotepeque, San Juan Sacatepequez, and Cobain. The specimen previously mentioned as collected in a maize field at Cubil- quitz, which may have been grown for grain, also belongs here. As an ornamental the race is cultivated over much of the world and is oc- casionally collected as an escape at widely-scattered places. Specimens have been examined from a few places in the United States all the way from Massachusetts and South Carolina to California; the states of Puebla, Vera Cruz, and Oaxaca in Mexico; British Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Porto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Barbados; the departments of Atlantico, Anti6quia, Cauca, and Cundinamarca in Colombia; Ecuador; Merida in Venezuela; the states of Pernambuco, Minas Geraes, and Sao Paulo in Brazil; Hawaii, the Fiji Islands, New Guinea, Sumatra, British North Borneo; the islands of Mindanao, Mindoro, and Luzon in the Philippines; Japan; the provinces of Kiangsu, Anhwei, and Chekiang in China; Annam in Indo-China; Kenya and Uganda in British East Africa; and Coquilhatville in the Belgian Congo. The inflorescences of this race are much more lax and usually more slender than those of A. leucocarpus (see pl. 13D). Though the slender bract points ex- tend well beyond the laminas, the bracts are very small, so that the inflorescence has a soft appearance. The tepals are characteristically much shorter and slightly less acute than in A. leucocarpus and they are not recurved. The utricle cap is unique among all the amaranth species I have seen, being contracted into a narrow tower below the bases of the style-branches; the style-branches are slender and erect. Except for some variation in tepal length, most noticeable in the Central American specimens, this race is very homogeneous. The Guatemalan grain speci- mens are both pale- and dark-seeded, in about equal proportions. All the other specimens are dark-seeded. Mexican Race of A. cruentus.-This group has a curiously scattered distribu- tion in Mexico: Acatlan in Puebla, Zimatlain in Oaxaca, Ymala in Sinaloa, and</page><page sequence="42">[VOL. 37 602 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN Cusihuiriachic in Chihuahua. It is known to be a cultivated grain crop at all these places except Cusihuiriachic, where it was collected without data. An amaranth very closely related to this group is cultivated by the Pueblo peoples of the southwestern United States as a dye plant (J. Sauer, in press). In inflorescence (pl. 14A) and most flower characters this race is very close to the common race of A. cruentus. It differs mainly in the shape of the utricle cap, which appears to be intermediate between A. cruentuts and A. leucocarpus or A. hybridus. All the grain specimens are pale-seeded; the specimen from Cusihuiriachic and the Pueblo dye plants are dark-seeded. Amaranthus caudatus L.- As mentioned in the discussion of grain amaranth cultivation in South America, this species was originally described from Peru. Thanks to the strikingly long and drooping tail-like inflorescence, which gives the species its name, the species has been more consistently recognized than most of the others. Nevertheless, speci- mens of A. caudttus are often mislabelled in herbaria, and at least one later synonym, A. Alopecurus, is found in the literature. The name A. Alopecurus was given by Hochstetter to a group of specimens collected in Abyssinia, which he apparently believed represented an endemic African species. All the collections cited in the original description of A. Alopecurus (Braun and Bouche, 1872) have been examined and found to be indistinguishable from South American collections of A. caudatus. This is the second of the great grain amaranth species; it is grown as a crop in both South America and the Old World. Specimens known to represent the grain crop are available from several Andean places: La Mejorada, Ollantaytambo, and Cuzco in Peru; Sacaba, Angostura, and Tarija in Bolivia; San Carlos in Argentina. As in the case of A. leucocar pus, most of the Old World specimens are marked as cultivated, but almost none are accompanied by any data on the reason for culti- vation. Janaki-Ammal found A. caundatus grown for grain in Nepal, along with A. leucocarpus. The known distribution of the species in Asia is strikingly like that of A. leucocarpus and of the localities in published records of grain amaranths. Specimens are available from Afghanistan, Baltistan, Ladak, Kumaon, and Nepal in the Himalaya; Yfinnan and Szechwan provinces in China; and Manchuria. The published records of grain amaranth cultivation in Africa identify the plants as A. caudatus or A. Alopecurus. The species has been collected not only in Abys- sinia, where it is apparently ruderal, but also in the Sudan and the Belgian Congo. None of the available specimens bear any data on use of the plants. The species includes the familiar ornamental Love-lies-bleeding, grown in many parts of the world and infrequently collected as an escape. The inflorescences are quite distinctive in that they usually have an extremely long, thick, trailing terminal spike. The individual glomerules become quite large and are relatively far apart, giving the spikes a peculiar knobby appearance. The "tail" is most conspicuous in the ornamental forms, which commonly have only a few lateral spikes. Many of the South American grain specimens also have the</page><page sequence="43">19 5 0] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 603 long "tail" with few lateral spikes (pl. 14B), but others have an inflorescence more like that of A. cruentus, with a relatively inconspicuous terminal spike and many lax lateral spikes. The bracts are usually fairly short and the laminas have broader bases than in the preceding species. The tepals are very broad toward the tips, often overlap- ping, and are strongly recurved. Even the outer tepals are somewhat obovate and the inner are definitely spatulate with a narrow claw. The inner tepals are obtuse- tipped or even emarginate. The style-branches are recurved, as in A. leucocarpus, but they are usually less thick and meet in a saddle rather than a cleft. The South American grain specimens are predominantly pale-seeded, but there are some reddish-seeded and some dark-seeded plants in most of the collections. The other specimens are mostly reddish-seeded, but a few of the Asiatic and African speci- mens have dark seeds. There is much minor variation in flower characters within this species, par- ticularly in the South American collections. One plant collected at San Carlos in Argentina deserves special mention. It is known to be derived from a mixed population of A. caudatus and A. edulis, grown together as a grain crop. Its in- florescence is approximately like that of other specimens of A. caudatus, and it lacks the polymerous staminate flowers which supply the key character of A. edulis. However, the pistillate flowers are almost indistinguishable from those of A. edulis. Amaranthus edulis Spegazzini.- This species was described by Spegazzini (1917, p. 163) from grain amaranths discovered at Amblayo in the Argentine province of Salta. The species has sub- sequently been found, always as a pale-seeded grain crop, only at a few other places in Salta and the neighboring provinces of Tucuman and Jujuy (Hunziker, 1943b, p. 325). Specimens are available to me only from Cachi, San Carlos, and another unidentified locality in Salta province. The inflorescence of this species is its most distinctive feature. Instead of the indeterminate thyrse common to the other species of AMARANTHOTYPUS, this species has inflorescence branches terminated by a peculiar 7- to 9-merous staminate flower. The non-terminal staminate flowers have the usual 5 parts. As a result of their determinate growth, the spikes become extraordinarily blunt and club- shaped (pl. 14C). In pistillate flower characters the species is not extremely dif- ferent from A. caudatus. The tepals are smaller and less strongly recurved and the style-branches are erect. A specimen from the mixed population at San Carlos is especially similar to A. caudatus. NON-CULTIVATED SPECIES Several species belonging to the section AMARANTHOTYPUS are recognizable among the wild and weed specimens examined. These share with the grain species the characters of the section: monoecious compound terminal inflorescences, 5- merous flowers, and circumscissile fruits. The non-cultivated plants are char- acteristically much smaller than the grain plants and have smaller flowers and</page><page sequence="44">[VOL. 37 604 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN A.

A distinction between weed species and truly wild species would be most desirable, but is not feasible since few of the available herbarium specimens bear adequate habitat data. Moreover, even in a field study such a distinction would be very difficult; throughout most of Latin America today, amaranths and other plants eaten by the ever-present livestock are difficult to find in natural habitats. Even the species which are not particularly weedy could be expected to be most abundant where they are protected by walls and fences. The non-cultivated species are here arranged, as were the grain species, in rough geographic sequence from north to south, as they occur in the New World.

Poweliji, with a wide latitudinal range will be consid- ered last. Another species, A. spino-sus, which is usually included in this section of the genus, is not discussed here; it is a widespread tropical weed quite similar in many ways to A. dubius (see below), but not very similar to. any of the grain species. It is readily distinguished from all the other species of the section not only by the peculiar spines but also by the- anomalous arrangement of staminate and pistillate flowers in the inflorescence. The peculiar distribution of sexes in the inflorescence of A. spinosus is discussed in detail by Murray (1940a). Anzaranthus retroflexuts L.- Linnaeus gave, the home of this species as Pennsylvania (1753, 2:991) ; his specimens were grown in pots from seeds collected by Peter Kalm. The name was suggested by a n"deformed example with backward-bent branches" (Thellung, 1914, p. 254). The original description was ambiguous, but has been amplified by Thellung and others. There is fairly good agreement as to the nature of the species, both in the literature and in herbarium determinations, although confusion with other species, particularly A. hybridus, is by no means unusual. This is one of the most abundant and widespread of the North American weed amaranths. It has been collected, almost invariably in disturbed habitats, over most of the United States and at scattered places elsewhere. Specimens are avail- able from: Ontario, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, West Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri; North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Oregon, and California; also from Coahuila, Mexico; from Japan; from Hopeh and Shantung provinces in China; Kashmir in India;</page><page sequence="46">I VOL. 37 606 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN Uzbekistan in the U.S.S.R.; Persia, Iraq, Armenia, Palestine, Algeria and Morocco. Thellung (1914, p. 254) cites numerous collections from Europe. The inflorescence of this species is extremely thick, stiff, and erect. The numerous lateral spikes are quite short and crowded together. (One small group of specimens from Coahuila, Mexico, is distinctive in having a small inflorescence without lateral spikes.) The bracts are large, with unusually heavy midribs; the points of the bracts, though not long-excurrent beyond the laminas, commonly extend well beyond the flowers and give the inflorescence a rough, bristly look. The tepals are much longer than the fruit, usually definitely recurved near the tips, and obovate or slightly spatulate (fig. 6). The tepals are somewhat indurated at the bases in mature flowers. The inner tepals, and often the outer also, are definitely obtuse or emarginate at the tips. The style-branches are erect or slightly recurved; their bases are moderately thick and usually form a shallow cleft. It may be possible with refined measurements of flower characters to separate some minor races of this species, but in the material examined variation between individuals scarcely exceeds variation within some single inflorescences. Amaranthn's viscidulus Greene.-4 This species was described by Greene (1898, p. 344) from a specimen collected in the Sierra Blanca south of Carrizozo, New Mexico. It has since been collected only in the same mountains and a little to the north, near Pecos. Standley con- sidered A. viscidulus as a synonym of A. bracteosus (1914, p. 508), but comparison of the type specimens shows little similarity in flower characters. Among other differences, A. viscidulus is uniformly 5-merous, while A. bracteosus has a reduced stamen number. A. bracteosus is here considered a synonym of A. Powellii (see below). This species has a small unbranched terminal inflorescence, with a very prickly aspect because of the large bracts. The bracts and tepals are much like those of A. retroflexus, but the tepals are more strongly recurved and more extremely emarginate. The utricle cap has a distinctive large tower below the style-branches, which are unusually long. Amaranthus Bigelovii Uline &amp; Bray.- This is another minor endemic species, described from western Texas by Uline and Bray (1894, p. 271). I have seen only the type specimen. As in A. viscidulus, there is only a small unbranched terminal inflorescence. The bracts are moderately large, with a narrow midrib. The tepals extend well beyond the small fruit; they are strongly recurved, definitely spatulate and emarginate, and somewhat indurated at the bases. The style-branches are erect and of medium length; their bases are slender and form a shallow cleft. Amaranthus Brandegei Standley.- This is another minor endemic species, described by Standley (1917, p. 109) from a plant collected in Sinaloa, Mexico. I have seen only the type and another specimen from Colima.</page><page sequence="47">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 607 The individual cymes of the inflorescence are predominantly monochasial rather than dichasial; as a result the entire inflorescence has a lax, spindly aspect. The bracts are short, with a heavy midrib which does not extend far beyond the lamina. The tepals are about as long as the fruit, acute-tipped, definitely recurved, and heavily thickened at the base. The style-branches are very short and have especially thick bases. The stamen number is uniformly 5, not 2-3 as stated in the original description. Amaranthus scariosus Benth.- The original description of this species (Bentham, 1844, p. 158) was ac- companied by good drawings of the flowers, which leave no doubt as to the species characters. The type specimen was collected on Isla Tigre in the Gulf of Fonseca off the Honduras coast. Specimens have since been collected in the states of Guerrero, Vera Cruz, and Yucatan in Mexico, in Guatemala, El Salvador, Hon- duras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The few specimens with habitat data were weeds of disturbed sites. The terminal and lateral spikes of the inflorescence are moderately thick, very long, and erect. The entire inflorescence is large and showy, so that the plants look much more like cultigens than any of the other weed species. Except for its totally different inflorescence, the species is similar to A. Bigelovii. The bracts are fairly long, with a slender midrib extending into a moderately long point. The strongly recurved tepals extend well beyond the small fruit; in the mature flowers they become heavily indurated at their bases. The outer tepals are obovate and acutish at the tips, the inner definitely spatulate and emarginate. The utricle cap is extremely rugose above the line of dehiscence. The style-branches are of medium length and slightly recurved; their bases are slender and meet in a shallow cleft. Amaranthuns dubius Mart. ex Thellung.- For a long time this species was erroneously given the Linnaean name A. tristis (Willdenow, 1798, p. 21; Moquin-Tandon, 1849, p. 260; etc.). Thellung's in- vestigation of Linnaeus' specimens showed that the name A. tristis was originally applied to an entirely different entity (Thellung, 1912, p. 203; 1914, p. 265), and that there was no valid name available for this species. Thellung gave a full description of the species under the name A. dubius, previously published only as a nomnen nudum by Martius (1814, p. 197). The name A. dubius has since been generally adopted for this species in herbarium determinations and published floras. Amaranthus dubius is the common weed amaranth of the Caribbean; specimens are available from Cuba, Grand Cayman, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Porto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Grenada, Trinidad, and Curagao. On the main- land it has been found in the states of Campeche and Yucatan in Mexico; in Guatemala; Costa Rica; Panama; the departments of Antioquia, Santa Marta, Valle del Cauca, and Bolivar, in Colombia; Nueva Esparta in Venezuela; British Guiana; and in Surinam. Only a few collections are available from outside this area: one from a boat landing in Massachusetts, one from the port of Mazatlan on the west coast of Mexico, and a few from Hawaii and the Marshall Islands.</page><page sequence="48">[VOL. 37 608 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN The spikes are quite variable in number and length; they are relatively slender and quite lax and soft-looking. The bracts are small, seldom exceeding the flowers; their midribs are slender and extend beyond the laminas in points. The tepals are about the same length as the mature fruits, incurved rather than recurved, and not indurated at the base. The outer tepals are oblong and acute-tipped, the inner obovate and obtuse-tipped. The small utricles have a relatively large tower below the style-branches, which are usually erect and long. Amaranthus quitensis H.B.K.- This species was described by Kunth (1817, p. 194) from plants collected in Ecuador. The original description is ambiguous and I have been unable to borrow the type material. The interpretation of the species here is based on the detaikd description by Thellung (1914, p. 252), who had access to the Humboldt and Bonpland collection. About half of the specimens here included were labelled A. quitensis on the herbarium sheets; the others were given a wide variety of names. This species is one of the most widespread weed amaranths of South America. It has been collected in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Formosa, Santiago del Estero, Tucuman, Salta, Jujuy, and Misiones in Argentina; in La Paz in Bolivia; in Ecuador; and in the Galapagos Islands. The mature inflorescences are comparatively large, with many long lax lateral spikes. The bracts are long, with a moderately heavy midrib and moderately long point. The tepals are longer than the mature fruits and definitely recurved. The outer tepals are oblong or slightly obovate, and acute-tipped; the inner are obovate or broadly spatulate, and obtuse-tipped. The style-branches are usually erect and fairly long; their bases are rather slender and meet in a shallow cleft. Amaranthus celosioides H.B.K.- This is another species rather ambiguously described by Kunth (1817, p. 194), for which the type material is not available. The type collection was made in Venezuela. I have seen no Venezuelan material which agrees with the description of this species, but four specimens are available from Peru and Ecuador which can be tentatively assigned here. All of these were determined as A. celosioides by Standley and two were cited by him in a published flora of Peru (1937, p. 484). All these specimens have the peculiar small bracts with very short points, used by Thellung (1914, p. 251) as the key character of the species. They also share a peculiar utricle cap, contracted into a narrow tower below the erect style- branches. In other characters the available specimens are extremely variable and some may be of hybrid origin. Additional collections and re-examination of the type are badly needed for better definition of this species. Amnaranthus hybridus L.- Up to this point, few obvious intermediates between species have been en- countered and definition of the species has been reasonably simple. Any hybrid- ization which may occur between the species considered so far must be too infrequent to obscure the entities.</page><page sequence="49">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 609 Nevertheless, the amaranths are notorious for their ability to hybridize. Acci- dental interspecific hybrids in great variety have been reported by many writers, from Willdenow (1798) and Regel (1849) to Thellung (1914, 1928) and Priszter (1949); various artificial crosses have been made by Murray (1938, 1940a, 1940b). Most of the accidental hybrids have been found in Europe, where species native to many different parts of the world have come into contact as weeds or been brought together in botanical gardens. In the regions under consideration here, few species have overlapping ranges, and the possible hybrid combinations are very limited. However, there is one species of section AMARANTHOTYPUS, A. hybridus, which has an especially wide range, overlapping that of various other species. Here, for the first time, we encounter variants which approach other species and cause serious difficulty in definition of the entity. In the original description of A. hybridus, Linnaeus gave its home as Virginia (1753, 2:990), citing also Ray's earlier report of the plants as wild in New Eng- land. Linnaeus' species A. hypochondriacus, also attributed to Virginia and New England (1753, 2:991), was distinguished from A. hybridus only by having reddish rather than green pigmentation; it is generally regarded as synonymous with A. hybridus (Thellung, 1914, p. 241; Standley, 1917, p. 111). About half of the specimens here included had been labelled A. hybridus; the rest had been given a wide variety of names, among which A. chiorostachys Willd. was prominent. This is one of the many names which Thellung reduced to synonymy with A. hybridus. Northern Race of A. hybridus.-This race is common as a weed in the eastern United States and has been found at scattered places in the Old World. Specimens have been examined from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas; also from Bermuda, the Bahamas, Japan, China, Algeria, Morocco, and Australia. The inflorescences ordinarily have a great many short, crowded, lateral spikes, as in A. retroflexus, but the spikes are much less stiff and much less thick. The bracts are quite long, and the rather slender midribs extend far beyond the laminas. The tepals are about as long as the fruit, slightly recurved and often lightly in- durated at the bases. The outer tepals are oblong and acute-tipped, the inner slightly obovate and acutish-tipped. The utricle cap narrows to a tower below the style-branches; the style-branches are erect and their bases are slender, meeting in a shallow cleft. Individual specimens often show definite divergence from the norm of the race, both in superficial appearance and in flower characters. I believe that much of this variation is produced by introgression from A. retroflexus. Mass collections from weed amaranth populations around St. Louis (J. D. Sater I473, 50 plants; I483, 30 plants; etc.) include a continuous series of intermediates between the two</page><page sequence="50">[VOL. 37 610 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN species. In some of these Missouri weed populations hybridization between A. hybridus and the genus Acnida is also indicated (J. D. Sauer I482, 25 plants; etc.). Hybrids between Amaranthus and Acnida have been produced artificially by Murray (1940a). Tropical Race of A. hybridus.-This race is a common weed from Mexico through Central America into northern South America and is scattered widely elsewhere. Specimens have been examined from the states of Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacain, Mexico, Puebla, Vera Cruz, Tabasco and Oaxaca in Mexico; from Guatemala; El Salvador; Costa Rica; the departments of Tachira, Merida, and the Distrito Federal in Venezuela; La Paz and Cochabamba in Bolivia; the states of Sio Paulo and Minas Geraes in Brazil; the Dominican Republic; and Algeria. In its inflorescence and flower characters, this race is much like the northern race of the species. The most tangible difference is in the utricle cap and style- branches. In the tropical race, the utricle cap tapers more gradually and is not constricted into a definite tower; the bases of the style-branches are farther apart and form more of a saddle than a cleft. There is more variation between individual specimens included in this race than in any other of the entities examined. Even within what may be regarded as the core of the group, there are many subtle variants. Ranged around this indistinct core is a bewildering variety of divergent individuals, scarcely any two of which are exactly alike, even within a single collection. These specimens, not clearly assignable to any species, are not cited in the Specimens Examined on pages 620- 623. A few of these divergent individuals appear to be intermediate between A. hybridus and the grain species: A. leucocarpus is approached by some Mexican specimens (e.g. J. D. Sauer I3I3), A. cruentus by some Central American speci- mens (e.g. Standley 59046). Other individuals approach some of the non-culti- vated species of the section: A. retroflexus in northeastern Mexico (e.g. Gregg 283), A. scariosus in southern Mexico and Guatemala (e.g. Pringle 6735), A. dubius in Central America (e.g. Pittier d Durand 3534), and A. quitensis in Bolivia (e.g. Bro. Julio I36). Moreover, there is a bewildering series of forms, often labelled A. hybridus in herbaria, which appear to be intermediate between A. hybridus and species in other sections of the genus. This heterogeneous group includes specimens from wide areas of North, Central, and South America. Some of them diverge from typical A. hybridus in habit and inflorescence aspect, some have indehiscent fruits, almost all have reduced tepal or stamen number or both. This complex of divergent forms related to A. hybridus cannot be satisfactorily analyzed here. Description and illustration of the collected variants, which prob- ably represent only a small sample of the actual diversity, would require more space than all the preceding entities. Moreover, a much greater density of col- lections, together with mass samples of critical populations, are needed for an</page><page sequence="51">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 611 understanding of this group. With the available material, I could do no more than speculate as to which variants are of hybrid origin and which are stable entities deserving taxonomic recognition. Amaranthus Powellii S. - Wats.- This species characteristically has fewer than 5 stamens and therefore would be excluded from the section AMARANTHOTYPUS as usually defined. However, in other characters it is too close to some of the species of the section to be ignored here. Like A. leucocarpus, A. Powellii was described by Watson (1875, p. 347) from plants grown at Harvard from Powell's wonderful packet of Arizona seeds. Unlike A. leucocarpus, this species has since been collected in abundance. It has been generally recognized by American workers (Uline and Bray, 1894, p. 313; Stand- ley, 1917, p. 112; and others). A minor species from New Mexico, A. bracteosus, has been described as distinct from A. Powellii (Uline and Bray, 1894, p. 314), but examination of the type collections of both species reveals no impressive dif- ferences. I believe A. bracteosus should' be reduced to a synonym of A. Powellii. The specimens included here had mostly been labelled as either A. Powellii, A. hybridus, or A. retroflexus in about equal proportions. Great Basin Race of A. Powellii.-This race, which includes the type of the species, is common as a weed and is occasionally reported in natural habitats over much of the western United States and northern Mexico. It has been found mostly at high elevations, often between 2,000 and 3,000 meters, in dry regions. Specimens are available from Wisconsin, Texas, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Oregon, California, and from the Mexican states of Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Baja California. The inflorescences characteristically have a quite long, erect, terminal spike and a few erect lateral spikes; the spikes are thick and stiff and have a very prickly appearance from the exceptionally long bracts. The bracts are similar to those of A. retroflexus, with a very heavy midrib and a large lamina extending well toward the tip. In other characters, this group is quite distinct from A. retroflexus. There are usually three or four stamens, although some flowers with five stamens can be found on a good many individuals. Tepal number in both staminate and pistillate flowers usually varies from four to five. The tepals are usually a little longer than the utricle, straight or slightly recurved, and somewhat indurated at their bases. The outer tepals are oblong or ovate, and acute-tipped; the inner are oblong or slightly obovate, and acutish or somewhat obtuse at the tips. The utricle cap tapers to the style-branches. The style-branches are of medium length and slightly recurved; their thick bases form a shallow cleft. Variation in flower characters within this race is not great.</page><page sequence="52">[VOL. 37 612 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN Cordilleran Race of A. Powellii.-This race is common as a weed in California and has been collected infrequently but very widely in Latin America, particularly at high elevations. Specimens are available from the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi, Tamaulipas, Michoacain, and Puebla in Mexico; Ecuador; Peru; Chile; La Paz in Bolivia; and Tucumain in Argentina. IThis race is very similar to the preceding race in most characters, and probably cannot be clearly separated from it. It differs in having somewhat longer and more acute tepals, which are seldom recurved, and longer style-branches with thicker bases. Other Closely Related Species.- The existence of reduced stamen and tepal numbers in A. Powellii, as well as in some aberrant forms of A. hybridus, raises a question about the definition of the section AMARANTHOTYPUS. The section was originally defined to include only a few adventive American species present in Europe; these were all sharply distinct from the native species. The section retains clear definition, as in Thellung's treatment (1914), only so long as consideration is limited to species present in the Old World. I know of no generally recognized or recognizable species peculiar to the Old World which is not distinguishable from all the species of AMARANTHOTYPUS by several qualitative characters. However, sharp definition of the section disappears when all the American species are considered. Among the New World endemics, there are a great many generally recognized species which are transitional; they are obviously closely related to AMARANTHOTYPUS, but lack one of the characters of the section. For example, A. Palmeri S. Wats., a common weed amaranth of the drier parts of the United States and Mexico, differs from species of AMARANTHOTYPUS chiefly by being dioecious; A. Wrightii S. Wats., a minor endemic of the southwestern states, differs only by its reduced stamen and tepal number; A. chihuahuensis S. Wats., a north Mexican endemic, only by its lack of a terminal spike; A. ataco Thellung, of Chile and Argentina, only by its indehiscent fruit. There are various similar examples of North and South American species which would be excluded from the section by. a single character. A considerable amount of material of these border-line species has been' ex- amined. None of it appears to be particularly close to any of the grain amaranths and it will not be discussed here. Once the rather arbitrary limits of the section AMARANTHOTYPUS are passed, there seems to be no natural stopping place short of a complete study of all the American species of Amaranthus. III. CONCLUSIONS The grain amaranths belong to several distinct but closely-related species, culti- vated by a curiously diverse and scattered group of peoples since immemorially ancient times. Only a rough outline of the complex history of these ancient plants can be given in this preliminary survey.</page><page sequence="53">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 613 In the Americas there are four major grain amaranth regions, each with its own peculiar cultivated species. Anzaranthus leucocarpus dominates the great Mexican center and its tenuous extension into the southwestern United States. Amaranthus cruentus is cultivated in Guatemala, A. caudatus in the Andes, and A. edulis in Argentina. There seems to have been some diffusion of species between the Mexican and Guatemalan centers and between the Andean and Argentine centers, but on the whole the ranges of the species in the New World are distinct. In Asia there is a great, vaguely delimited grain amaranth region stretching all the way from Manchuria through interior China and the Himalaya to Afghanistan and Persia. Amaranthus leucocarpus and A. caudatus are both grown throughout this area. The poorly known grain crop of Africa is probably also A. candatus. In mode of cultivation and use, the Old and New World crops are strikingly similar. In both areas the crop shows a special affinity for the highlands; so far as I know, its concentration at high elevations is not explainable by any natural barriers. Many wild amaranth species are common in the lowlands, and the grain species themselves are widely grown down to sea level as ornamentals. In both the Old and New World, the plants are usually grown on a small scale, mixed in the plantings of maize and other crops. The grain is ordinarily consumed by the growers and is prepared in similar ways almost everywhere. The seeds are first parched or popped; then they are either made into balls like popcorn, with a syrup binder, or they are ground to meal, which is stirred into a drink or baked into little cakes. Taxonomically, all of the grain amaranths cultivated in the Old World are indistinguishable from certain of those cultivated in the New World. Not only in terms of species, but also in terms of sub-specific entities, the available Old World specimens represent nothing but a small sample of the diversity present in the American grain amaranths. There is an important group of cultivated ama- ranths which are obviously natives of Asia, including A. tricolor, A. melancholicus, A. mangostanus, A. gangeticus, etc. However, these are grown exclusively as pot- herbs or ornamentals, apparently never for the seeds. This entire Asiatic pot-herb group is easily distinguishable from the grain group by important technical char- acters, such as number of stamens, number of tepals, and shape of the tepals. Few of these Asiatic species are even superficially similar to the grain amaranths; for one thing, none of them has a branched terminal inflorescence. The non-cultivated amaranths closely related to the grain species also show a striking concentration in the New World. There are many entities in this section of the genus which are endemic to the Americas; some are weeds, some appear to be truly wild. No evidence was found, either in the literature or in the herbarium, of any non-cultivated entity closely related to the grain amaranths which is peculiar to the Old World. Except in the Americas, members of this section of the genus are ordinarily found outside of cultivation only as sporadic adventive weeds.</page><page sequence="54">[VOL. 37 614 ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN The conclusion appears inescapable that the grain amaranths are all of New World origin. From which wild species they were derived is less clear. The grain species are all cultigens, unknown in the wild except as infrequent escapes. Amaranthus leucocarpus is morphologically fairly close to two non-cultivated species, A. hybridus and A. Powellii, both widespread in North and Central America. Arnarant/wts cruentus is more like A. dubius of Central America and the West Indies, while A. cactdahts and A. edulis are closer to a South American wild species, A. quitensis. I am unable even to guess as to whether the cultigens were derived from these or similar wild species by simple selection or whether they are of complex hybrid origin. The sharp taxonomic separation found between the cultivated species and their closest wild relatives was completely unexpected, since the frequency of hybridiza- tion in this genus is well known. The discontinuity may be explainable by the almost universal practice of selecting pale seeds for planting. No analysis of the genetics of the seed color is available, but it seems likely that the pale-seeded culti- vated forms are simple recessives. If so, elimination of dark seeds in planting should be an effective barrier against introgression from wild species, which are without exception dark-seeded. The cultigens differ from the wild species, not only in characters which are probably simple genetically, such as seed color, but also in quantitative char- acters, particularly those affecting grain yield. The higher yield of the cultivated species results mostly from the greater number of flowers and seeds produced, rather than from larger seed size. The cultigens are strikingly bigger in plant size than the wild species; they have more inflorescences per plant and the inflorescences are enormously larger and more compound. A well-developed grain amaranth produces such an enormous quantity of seed, though the seeds are individually minute, that the yield of the crop per unit area often exceeds that of maize, ac- cording to the few published statistics on yield and the opinions of Latin American farmers with whom I have talked. Development of these stable entities so distinct from their wild relatives would be expected to require long selection. The antiquity of the crop is also indicated by other evidence. In both Asia and the Americas the crop has almost invariably been reported as a declining and disappearing relic, conserved mostly in remote primitive communities. Abundant direct evidence of the antiquity of the crop is available for the New World. In addition to the archaeologic cache of A. caudatus fruits found in South America, there are the magnificent early documentary records from Mexico. These indicate that grain amaranths were one of the great food staples of Mexico at the time of the Conquest, regarded by the people as among their most ancient crops, and fantastically important in legend and ritual. The question as to whether the crop reached Asia before the European expan- sion cannot be answered with certainty. There is the 10th-century Chinese docu- ment which seems to refer to grain amaranths, but this is hardly absolute proof. If the crop was introduced into Asia after Columbus, it must be credited with a</page><page sequence="55">1950] SAUER-GRAIN AMARANTHS 615 remarkable achievement in making itself very much at home among strangers. within a few generations. Of course, if these people were accustomed to cultivate one species of grain amaranth, rapid adoption of a second species would not be so remarkable. Of the two species grown for grain in Asia, A. leucocarpus is the more common and widespread and might be supposed to be more ancient in the area. Strangely enough, plants resembling A. leucocarpus do not appear in the European herbals until about 1700, more than a century after A. caudatus had been brought to Europe as an ornamental. We have seen that the practice of cultivating grain amaranths is old and deep in various cultures. I believe these plants deserve special consideration by those willing to speculate about the very beginnings of agriculture. Various workers have inclined to the idea that the transition of plants from wild to domesticated was not always accomplished in a single step by deliberate domestication. In many cases wild plants may have become weedy camp-followers and entered culti- vation gradually through a long process of modification by largely unconscious human selection. One version of this concept has been well expressed by Frazer (1912, 1:128). He postulated that by digging up the soil in a search for roots, ancient man produced favorable growing plots for his wild food seeds, dropped accidentally during winnowing or other operations. A slightly different version than Frazer's would involve the accidental establishment of useful plants on village refuse heaps. In either case, by continued harvesting and accidental sowing, plants able to persist in such disturbed habitats might become domesticated by imper- ceptible degrees. The amaranths are attractive candidates for such accidental domestication; the seeds of the wild species are often gathered and eaten by primi- tive peoples and the plants are notoriously successful weeds of disturbed habitats. Following another line of reasoning, Carl Sauer (1936, p. 292) pointed out that the presence side by side in an area of two starch crops, one localized and the other of wide range, suggests that the local crop is older in the area; it can survive as a relic because of tradition and the inertia of habit. "Qualities that are insuf- ficient to cause the development side by side of two similar foodstuffs from dif- ferent wild ancestors may be sufficient to keep one in use if a more valuable crop is brought in from another area." This line of reasoning suggests that grain amaranths, at least in some areas, are relics of an ancient staple starch crop, largely supplanted by a later arrival, maize. Such speculations will obviously need additional support from factual evidence if they are to become more than hypotheses. Such evidence may eventually come from analysis of pollen deposits. Deevey (1944, p. 149) made a suggestive pre- liminary pollen analysis of sediments in Lake Paitzcuaro in Michoacan, Mexico. He estimated that the sediments are now accumulating at the rate of about one meter in 400 years, but that deposition was probably slower in the past. Maize and agave pollen were found down to depths of between four and five meters. About a meter lower, he found that there had been a sudden increase in deposition of a type of pollen identified only as coming from either chenopods or amaranths.

It may be derived from wild amaranths or chenopods, as Deevey assumes. On the other hand, it may mark the coming of an agriculture based on grain amaranth cultiva- tion. When the first Spanish conquerors arrived on the shores of this same lake, some thousands of years after this pollen was deposited, they found that the Indians had the custom of making little figures of amaranth meal for the festival of their earth goddess, giver of all crops.

A. ANONYMOUS, CA. I540.- (20). Iba esta diosa [Cueravaperi] dos fiestas con sus sacerdotes a la ciudad de Mechuacan por la fiesta de Cuingo y Corindaro . . . Era tenida en mucho en toda esta provincia, y nombrada en todas sus fabulas y oraciones, y decian que era madre de todos los dioses de la tierra, y que ella los envi6 a morar a las tierras, dandoles mieses y semillas que trujesen. (I08). Luego como vieron los indios los espanloles, de ver gente tan estrania y ver que no comian sus comidas de ellos, y que no se emborrachaban como ellos, llamaibanlos tucupacha, que son dioses . . . y a los caballos llamaban venados, y otros tuycen, que eran unos como caballos que ellos hacian en una su fiesta de Cuingo, de pan de bledos. B. ANONYMOUS, CA. I550.- Cap. I (I28). Las mozas deste recogimiento, dos dias antes de la fiesta deste idolo, Huitzilo- puchtli, molian mucha cantidad de semilla de bledos juntamente con maiz tostado, y despu6s de molido, amasabanlo con miel, y hazian de aquella masa un idolo tan grande como era el de madera . . . Hecho esto, salian todas las doncellas con el aderezo referido y sacaban de su recogimiento unos trozos de massa de maiz tostado, y bledos que es la mesma de que el idolo era hecho, hechos a manera de huevos grandes, y entregabanlos a los mancebos, y ellos subianlos arriba, y ponianlos i los pies.del idolo por todo aquel lugar hasta que no cabian mas: a estos trozos de masa llamaban los huessos y carne de Huitzilopuchtli.
