<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS THE LOOM OF LANGUAGE. By FREDERICK BODMER, ed. by LANCELOT HOG- BEN. Pp. 692. New York: W. W. Norton, 1944. The Loom of Language is the third in a series of books which have as their principal purpose the interpretation of science to the layman. Mathematics for the Million was the first of these; in it Lancelot Hogben attempted to describe the practical origins of mathematics as well as to present in non-technical lan- guage the essentials of mathematical procedures. Science for the Citizen, also by Hogben, had the same objective in regard to the natural sciences. It should be noted that these books, as well as the work under review, are neither simple popularizations nor mere 'self-help' manuals. They seek rather to steer a middle course. Mathematics, the sciences, and linguistics are to be presented as accurately as possible but in a language wholly free from merely academic technicalities, and from the point of view of the practical, everyday citizen rather than the cloistered scholar. In The Loom of Language, Hogben states this general purpose as follows: 'First and foremost The Loom of Language is a book which adults can use as a basis for sustained study, and a book from which teachers alert to new techniques of instruction to meet the needs of the ordinary citizen can get helpful suggestions with a direct bearing on their daily task. Its design is based on the conviction that in the past the orientation of studies in many of our schools and universities has not provided a sufficient equipment for the constructive tasks of the society in which we live, that radical changes in the scope and methods of education are a necessary condition of con- tinued social progress, that such educational reforms will not come about unless there is a vigorous popular demand for them' (ix). And later: 'Because this book is a successor to Mathematics for the Million and Science for the Citizen, its motif is social and its bias is practical' (x). The author of The Loom of Language, Frederick Bodmer, is described by his editor as a former colleague at the University of Cape Town. There he served as a Lecturer in German. Other than this he is not identified, either in terms of his scholarly publications or with regard to his present position. Reference materials available to the present reviewer fail to provide additional data. Hogben had a great deal more to do with the actual writing of the book than is usual for an editor. He and Bodmer discussed and reviewed every chapter in detail before it was put in final form, and Hogben even admits to having condensed and rewritten some of the chapters. Nevertheless, as he himself maintains, the 'erudition' displayed in the work is wholly that of the author. Hogben functioned solely as an interested layman whose principal task was to test the communicability of the author's expositiops. Primarily, The Loom of Language is designed to contribute to a major social problem: the persistence of linguistic diversity in a world more or less uniform in other aspects of civilization. 'In the pursuit of their tool-bearing activities, men and women have learned to co-operate on a planetary scale; but such co- operation is perpetually thwarted by local limitations of their speech habits. 100</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 101 What is characteristic of the intellectual achievements of mankind . . . is a common possession of all nations which encourage scientific research, but nations have no common idiom through which workers by brain or hand can communicate results of research or collaborate in applying them to human welfare. Modern technology is a supernational culture which ministers to the common needs of human beings, while language limps behind the human endeavor to satisfy needs which all human beings share' (3). One way of removing linguistic impediments to easier worldwide communica- tion is 'to canalize the interest of intelligent men and women into the constructive task of devising or of adopting an auxiliary medium to supplement existing national languages ...' (3). In order properly to achieve this task it is necessary to know something of how 'natural' languages have developed, so that we may 'recognize defects which we ought not to perpetuate, and merits which we should incorporate, in a language of world citizenship' (27). Much of the book is devoted to this end. The whole of Part One (called The Natural History of Language and containing a chapter each on the story of the alphabet, accidence, syntax, and the classification of languages) is liberally interspersed with the recognition of such defects and merits. Part Three is given over wholly to The World Language Problem. The first chapter of this part (Chapter X. The Diseases of Language) analyzes from Bodmer's point of view the defects and merits of Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic, Celtic, Semitic, Chinese, and, very briefly, Pidgin English. Chapter XI (Pioneers of Language Planning) contains a history of international languages as well as brief analyses of the advantages and disadvantages of those so far produced. And in the final chapter of this section (Language Planning for a New Order) arguments are advanced in favor of language planning, and specifications for an international auxiliary presented. An acceptable international language, devised in the light of Bodmer's analyses, should be: (1) Isolating. 'With the possible exception of a plural terminal, it would have no flexional modifications of word form ... its rules of grammar would be rules of word order. These would be as uniform and as few as possible. In short, the grammar of the language could be set forth fully with examples in half a dozen pages of print' (516). (2) 'essentially a language with Latin-Greek word materials, so chosen that the beginner could associate items of the basic word list with syllables of interna- tionally current words' (516-7). (3) Economical of words. 'That is to say, the entire list of words [not count- ing various specialized vocabularies] . . . might not be more than one thousand' (517). (4) Spelled regularly with a spelling 'based on the characters of the Latin alphabet' (517). (5) 'easily equipped [because of its word economy] with the type of simplified alphabetic shorthand embodied in R. Dutton's ingenious system of Speedwords' (517). Despite this great emphasis on language planning, The Loom of Language is not 'first and foremost a plea for language planning' (4). Indeed, language</page><page sequence="3">102 REVIEWS planning alone will not solve the problem of worldwide communication, for the author clearly recognizes the fact that an international language, however chosen, will in no sense replace existing national idioms. Further, as his pre- scription clearly indicates, an international auxiliary can only function as a minimal means of communication between peoples of differing national tongues. For a true understanding of world problems it is equally necessary that a means be found whereby ordinary citizens can gain, as quickly and as easily as possible, a working knowledge of at least the principal world languages. This objective, the author insists, is wholly possible, once we succeed in finding a proper method of teaching languages. Present methods of language teaching in American and British schools are, in the author's belief, wholly inefficient. For one thing, students rarely know why they are studying a language, and teachers are equally vague as to the objec- tives of their teaching. But: 'This is not the whole story. To sins of omission we have to add all the positive obstacles which early formal education places in the way of those who have no strong personal inclination for linguistic studies. The greatest impediment, common to most branches of school and university education, is the dead hand of Plato. We have not yet got away from education designed for the sons of gentlemen. Educational Platonism sacrifices realizable proficiency by encouraging the pursuit of unattainable perfection' (5). For these reasons, then, The Loom of Language is designed not only to explore languages toward the end of devising an efficient international auxiliary, but also to examine world idioms with a view to how they may best be taught. The knowledge about modern languages that we may gain from comparing them one with another and surveying the history of their development will 'help us to get clearer about the best way to begin learning any particular [language] . . . . We shall . . . be in a better position to judge whether it is best to concentrate on speaking, writing, or reading in the early stages, and to decide what course to pursue in writing or speaking in order to fix the minimum vocabulary and grammatical rules we have to use' (27). Bodmer insists that a careful distinction be made between learning to read, write, speak, and understand a foreign tongue. Each of these ends requires a different technique. With developing the ability to speak or understand, how- ever, he is little concerned. Once the student can read and write, his speaking and understanding will come easily enough when, but only when, he is exposed to native speakers. Bodmer's main concern is with reading and writing or, more fairly perhaps, with the problem of gaining the minimum necessary command over the dictionary and grammar of the language being learned. Thus he spends much time, particularly in Parts One and Two (Our Hybrid Heritage: How to Learn the Basic Word List, Our Teutonic Relatives, The Latin Legacy, Modern Descendants of Latin), in delineating what he considers to be the necessary and functional aspects of grammar for those interested in learning languages. Briefly, these include a knowledge of many 'derivative words not commonly listed in dictionaries' (122); i.e. pronouns in all their variations, plural forms of nouns, auxiliary verbs, tense forms of verbs 'necessary in ordinary speech or corre- spondence' (117), and other inflected forms 'which still affect the meaning of a</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 103 statement' (114). 'When we can recognize [these] . . . and can use those which are essential, without offense to a native, we still need to know in what circum- stances a word in one language is equivalent to a word in another, how the mean- ing of a sequence of words is affected by the way in which we arrange them, and what derivatives to use in a particular context' (122-3). The building of a vocabulary is important as well. Here Bodmer insists that this tedious task is much lightened if two or even more related languages are taken together. He holds that language teachers should exploit the similarities between related languages and teach their students at least the more regular of the phonetic correspondences which link one cognate language with another. Thus: 'This conclusion [i.e. that languages are related] is of great practical value to anyone who is learning a language. Sound transformations between related languages such as English and German, or French and Spanish, are not mere historical curios, like the sound changes in the earlier history of the Indo-Euro- pean group. How to recognize them should take its place in the technique of learning a foreign language, because knowledge of them is an aid to memory, and often helps us to spot the familiar equivalent of an unfamiliar word. Use of such rules . . . should be part of the laboratory training of the home student who is learning a new language. The reader who takes advantage of the exhibits in the language museum of Part IV can exchange the monotony of learning lists of unrelated items for the fun of recognizing when the rules apply, of noticing exceptions, and of discovering why they are exceptions' (179). The numerous pitfalls inherent in such methods are not mentioned, however. To this reviewer at least, the many qualifications of detail attendant upon even the most regular of phonetic correspondences, the inconsistencies arising as a result of analogic change and borrowing, and the many cases in which meanings change without a corresponding change in phonetic form and vice versa would make this type of training confusing rather than helpful to the beginning student. The 'exhibits in the language museum' to which the author refers are lists of basic words in several Germanic and Romance languages. Words equivalent (but not necessarily cognate) in English, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, and German are given in parallel columns in one section, while in another we find English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian words similarly grouped. Since the author gives no indication of how the foreign words are to be pronounced, and since cognates are not distinguished from borrowings or simple translation forms, it is difficult to understand just what the beginning student is supposed to do with the 'exhibit'. A third list provides the 'Greek roots in common use for technical words of international currency,' which is presumably for use as a reservoir of vocabulary for Bodmer's international auxiliary. From this brief survey of Bodmer's purposes in writing The Loom of Language, it is evident that he is not primarily concerned with the science of language per se but rather with the practical applications of such a science to the problem of international communication. He seeks to understand the reasons for continued linguistic diversity in a world which in other aspects of culture is becoming more and more unified. Basically, Bodmer holds that this situation has come about largely because languages have developed in a planless and disorderly fashion.</page><page sequence="5">104 REVIEWS The history of languages 'is not a record of deliberate and intelligent prevision. It is partly a story of confusion resulting from a continuous record of slovenliness and of obstinate complacency toward the mistakes of our grandparents. It is also a story of ancestor worship, and of makeshifts to conserve the ineptitudes of a supposedly heroic past' (3-4). Once we have recognized this cardinal point, Bodmer avers, we can then proceed intelligently to the task of learning languages and planning an interna- tional auxiliary. It is clear, then, that Bodmer is not writing as a linguist but primarily in a spirit of social reform. Since, in his opinion, languages have be- come littered, as it were, with the odds and ends of thousands of years of aimless development and careless use, the forward-looking linguist and language teacher should not carefully preserve these illogicalities and redundancies of language, but should abolish them. Linguists and language teachers have in the past failed to do this; they have instead functioned as ancestor worshippers guilty of 'makeshifts to conserve the ineptitudes of a supposedly heroic past'. As a result, languages are unnecessarily difficult to learn. Bodmer continually reiterates his charge that language teaching has purposely been made difficult by 'perfec- tionist pedantry' and so linguistic facility has become 'the cultural trademark of a leisure class' (6). This, to Bodmer, is inconsistent with, if not actually a danger to the establishment of a democratic world order. It is the purpose of his book to remove this inconsistency. There can be little doubt of the reality of the central problem raised by Bodmer. The increasingly evident trend in the modern world toward greater economic and political interdependence cannot be denied. It is also true that linguistic diversity, or better, the lack of an international means of communica- tion, together with the essential failure on the part of educators to teach lan- guages effectively, constitutes an important barrier (though certainly not the only or even the most important barrier) to international goodwill and under- standing. It is equally clear that solutions to this problem must come in part from a thoroughly scientific analysis of linguistic structures; must come, in short, from a well developed body of data on the science of language. In this connection the fact may well be marked that notable contributions to the methodology of teaching languages have already been made by scientific lin- guists in the Army Specialized Training Program (see Mary Haas, The Linguist as a Teacher of Languages, LANG. 19.203-8). Unfortunately, however, Bodmer is not a linguist in the sense in which we are using the term. He does know something of the comparative method; he very evidently has a wide though uneven knowledge of certain Indo-European lan- guage groups; and he has made a systematic and detailed study of both the his- tory of international auxiliaries and the numerous problems to be faced in the setting up of an international language. But very serious doubts may be cast upon the author's ability to treat the purely linguistic problems incident to his main end. It is clear, for example, that Bodmer has no conception of such basic and elementary distinctions as those differentiating letters and speech sounds, speech sounds and phonemes, syllables and morphemes, and words and mor- phemes. Hence we find such absurdities as the following: 'Thus we can dis-</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 105 tinguish between words of three kinds. Some are the smallest elements of speech of which ordinary people can recognize the meaning. Some, separated by careful study, are products of grammatical comparison of situations in which they recur. People of a preliterate community would not recognize them as separate elements of speech. We recognize others as separate, merely because of the usual conventions of writing. The missionary or trader who first commits the speech of a nonliterate people to script has to use his own judgment about what are separate words, and his judgment is necessarily influenced by his own language' (37). 'When highbrows want a word for all pronounceable constitu- ents of a printed page, each with a distinct meaning or usage of its own, they may speak of them as vocables. Vocables include words listed in dictionaries, and derivatives which are not' (37). 'It is an accident that the syllables man and age in the word manage have a meaning when they stand by themselves' (38). '. . syllables which have a meaning relevant to the meaning of the whole word are called roots, though root words are not necessarily single syllables' (38). 'The ultimate bricks of a vocable are represented by the vowel symbols (in English script a, e, i, o, u) and the consonants which correspond to the re- maining letters of our Roman alphabet' (40). 'When fusion of the final -s of the plural, and -ed of the past with the preceding consonant of the noun or verb stem took place, necessary changes occurred. We pronounce cats as kats and cads as kadz. We pronounce sobbed as sobd, and helped as helpt. Thus the grammatical rules of English would be a little more complicated, if we spelt all words as we pronounce them. We should have a large new class of plurals in -z, and many more past forms of the verb ending, like slept, in -t' (67). Our misgivings as to Bodmer's technical competence in linguistics are con- firmed by similar curiosa occurring throughout the book. Let us examine, for further examples, his chapter on accidence (subtitled The Table Manners of Language!), which is an attempt to study the development of flexions in the Indo-European languages as well as the circumstances which have led to their decay. Such a study, the author maintains, will help 'to learn languages in which the flexional system of the old Indo-European languages has decayed far less than in English' and 'also helps us to see characteristics to incorporate in a world medium which is easy to learn without being liable to misunderstanding' (82-3). Words grow, we are told, (1) by combining with other words to form com- pounds, (2) by fusing with other words constantly occurring in the same context through 'slipshod pronunciation' (this process is called 'agglutination'!), and (3) by taking over affixes borrowed from other languages. Once words have fused in the sense defined in (2) above, analogical extension enlarges the classes of derived words so formed. Dictionaries list some derived forms but others are found only in grammars. 'The real reason' for this distinction between one kind of derived form and another 'is this: vocables are put in grammar books instead of in dictionaries because they correspond to the class of derivatives most common in Latin or Greek.' And then: 'Grammarians call such deriva- tives, or their affixes, flexions. . . . Whether derivatives formed by adding affixes are called flexions depends largely upon whether they correspond to</page><page sequence="7">106 REVIEWS derivatives formed from a root with the same meaning in Latin or Greek' (81-2). Comment would appear to be superfluous. All flexions originated, it seems, in independent words which, through 'slip- shod pronunciation', became attached to verbs, nouns, or other words, and finally, through loss of significance and phonetic decay, became 'unnecessary linguistic luggage'. As an example of Bodmer's method we may quote the following two paragraphs purporting to describe the origin of personal flexions in the Indo-European languages (85-7): One thing the table exhibits is this. It was not customary to use the personal pronoun equivalent to I, he, we, etc., in the older languages of the Indo-European family. The ending attaching to the verb really had a use. It had to do the job now done by putting the pronoun in front of it. So the ending in modern descendants of such languages is merely the relic of what once did the job of the pronoun. This leads us to ask how the ending came to do so. A clue to a satisfactory answer is also in the table, which exposes a striking family resemblance among the endings of the older verbs of the Indo-European family. Of the five older representatives, four have the suffix MI for the form of the verb which corresponds to the first person singular. This at once reminds you of the English pronoun me, which replaces the first person I when it comes after the verb in a plain statement. Our table (p. 87) of corresponding pronouns of several languages placed in the Indo-European group, encourages us to believe that the correspondence between the English pronoun ME and the ending MI is not a mere accident. The meaning of this coincidence would be more difficult to understand if it were not due to a process which we can see at work in Anglo-American at the present day. When we speak quickly, we do not say I am, you are, he is. We say I'm, you're, he's .... The fact that the agglutinating, or gluing on of the pronoun, takes place in this order need not bother us, because the habit of invariably putting the pronoun before the verb is a new one. In Bible English we commonly meet with constructions such as thus spake he. Even in modern speech we say sez you. In certain circumstances this inversion generally occurs in other Teutonic languages as in Bible English. It was once a traffic rule of the Aryan family; and it is still customary in one group of Aryan languages. This group, called the Celtic family, furnishes suggestive evidence for the belief that the personal flexions which do the work of the absent pronoun in Latin or Greek were originally separate pronouns placed after the verb. Flexions of person, tense, number, comparison and adverb derivation, gender, case, mood, and voice are likewise treated. Personal and tense flexions are dis- posed of as follows: 'Clearly there is no tragedy in the removal of an overgrowth of mispronunciation that led to flexion of person. Similar remarks apply with equal force to the loss of tense flexion' (95). Number flexion, however, is a different matter: 'The number flexion -s of houses is not useless, as is the personal -s of bakes, nor pretentious like the luxuriant Latin tense distinctions. ... Num- ber flexion does not give rise to great difficulties for anyone who does not already know how to write English. Nearly all English nouns form their plural by adding -s or replacing y and o by -ies and -oes. As in other Germanic languages, there is a class with the plural flexion in -en (e.g. oxen), and a class with plurals formed by internal vowel change (louse, mouse, goose, man). The grand total of these exceptions is less than a dozen. They do not tax the memory. So we should not gain much by getting rid of number flexion' (98). Comparison, too, is a 'very regular and useful, though by no means indis- pensable' flexion (99), but adverb derivation 'is at best a convention of context,</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 107 and the complete decay of the adverbial derivative would be a change for the better' (100). The chapter is concluded with the following general verdict and a bit of advice: 'Though we cannot use a dictionary with profit unless we know something about accidence, we can lighten the tedium of getting a reading knowl- edge of a language, or of writing it intelligibly, if we concentrate first on learning: (a) flexional derivatives least easy to recognize, when we look up the standard form in a dictionary; (b) flexional derivatives which still affect the meaning of a statement' (115). One of the underlying misconceptions prevalent in the foregoing excerpts and running consistently throughout the book is Bodmer's curiously anthropomorphic view of language. Language, from his descriptions, is not an unconsciously developed set of habitual behavior patterns but a more or less carelessly made and slovenly construction of its grammarians and speakers. Its formal structure is in part 'unnecessary luggage' or an 'overgrowth of mispronunciation' pre- served by the 'ancestor worship' of grammarians and by the 'obstinate com- placency' of its speakers toward the 'mistakes' of their grandparents. One may just as well say that an earthquake or a violent storm is an error of a usually benign 'Mother Nature,' or that the peculiarities of dress and custom prevailing in a society are due to the vagaries of a 'group mind'. Another basic error is found in Bodmer's characterization of certain categories of language as 'useless', 'pretentious', or non-functional. Such categories, he maintains, are carry-overs from a period in which they were functional; they represent a lag in linguistic development similar to the 'cultural lag' of certain social scientists. But there is no real evidence, either in culture or in language, that traits persist without function. And to regard all flexions which no longer exist in English as functionless survivals adds the sin of ethnocentrism to that of linguistic naivet6. Despite, therefore, the significance of the problems posed by Bodmer and the numerous items of interest and value that may, albeit laboriously, be ex- humed from his book, it must be confessed that The Loom of Language con- tributes more to confusion than to clarity. This is particularly regrettable because the book is intended not for the specialist but for the layman. It is a great pity that Bodmer did not take the precaution of becoming somewhat better acquainted with the elements of linguistic science before he imposed upon an uninformed public his burden of linguistic misconceptions and errors. Indeed, it might very well be said that The Loom of Language will become a source of considerable embarrassment to the author should he ever gain an elementary knowledge of some of the topics on which he has elected to write. Though most conspicuous to the present reviewer, Bodmer's linguistic failings are not the only faults in The Loom of Language. Also questionable is his continued insistence that languages lacking flexions are easier to learn. Con- sider, for example, the following quotation (419): Because other Aryan languages such as Danish, Dutch, or Persian have discarded so much of the grammatical luggage which their ancestors had to carry, it is possible to simplify the task of transmitting a working knowledge of them by summarizing the relatively few essential rules with which the beginner must supplement a basic vocabulary. There is no</page><page sequence="9">108 REVIEWS royal road to fluency in a language which shares the grammatical intricacies of Sanskrit, Lithuanian, or Russian. It is therefore impossible to give the reader who wishes to learn Russian any good advice except to take the precaution of being born and brought up in Russia. Here the author is on very questionable ground. No one, to my knowledge, has ever succeeded in demonstrating that one language is intrinsically more difficult to learn than another. It is true, of course, that for a native speaking English, there are differences in the ease with which he may acquire other idioms. But it does not follow that these differences can be correlated with anything more than the degree to which such idioms differ structurally from English. To assume that learning to use Greek, Russian, or Navaho requires the student to acquire a greater total amount of lexicon and grammatical data than would be required of a Greek, Russian, or Navaho who sought to learn English is somewhat naive. We may conclude with a word of warning. Bodmer's book, with all its linguistic and educational shortcomings, has an immensely wider circulation than treatises on linguistics by scholars of recognized competence. This is because Bodmer has had the courage, if not the competence, to relate the study of languages to the wider social problems which alone can justify linguistic research. As long as linguists fail to recognize such problems, and as long as they persist in publishing books which are unintelligible to a non-professional audience, so long will the layman and the student have to depend on the kind of linguistics Bodmer has to offer.
