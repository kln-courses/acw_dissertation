In a region where such art was once believed to be sparse, more than 1,200 sites are now on record. These exhibit a remarkably diverse, intriguing and, in some cases, ancient array of artistic content. In Plains Indian Rock Art, two of the major contributors to the field, James Keyser and Michael Klassen, attempt a general overview of the subject. They claim, with justification, that their approach is both archaeological and aes- thetic. Moreover, they hope that the book will facilitate public learning about the origins, diversity, beauty and significance of the art, and that increased public appreciation will lead to greater concern for conservation. At the outset, I will observe that this book is more than an overview for the interested public, and less than a comprehensive study of Plains Indian rock art. In fact, the title is a mis- nomer. This is actually an examination of rock art in a portion of the Great Plains - specifically, the Northwestern Plains (i.e., the southern parts of Alberta and Sas- katchewan, Montana, Wyoming, and the western parts of the Dakotas). For that area, it provides a seminal study of deep scholarly interest, one that brings many lines of evidence together, forges them into a new synthesis of rock art styles and traditions, and bonds the results to an existing outline of Northwestern Plains culture-history. The book consists of two parts divided into 18 chapters. The first part, entitled "Introduction and Background," con- tains five chapters. The Introduction begins with a definition of the study area (the Northwestern Plains) and continues with: a brief history of rock art studies in the region; a definition of rock art as the art of petroglyphs and pictographs; a discussion of descriptive terms such as anthropomorph, zoomorph, and non- representational images; and finally, an explanation of the method and criteria used for classifying rock art into styles and traditions. This is backed up with chap- ters on rock art dating methods; descrip- tive and interpretive approaches (such as neuropsychological universals, semiotics, analogy, functional analysis, contextual analysis, and traditional explanations); plus a description of the region; an out- line of its archaeological history; and a summary of the historic Aboriginal cultures. Most chapters in this part, as throughout the book, are followed by a supplementary section containing a case study under the general heading "Interpreting the Art...." For example, after die chapter on "Dating Rock Art," there is a case study on "Superimpo- Canadian Journal of Archaeology/Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26: 199-202 (2002)</page><page sequence="2">sitioning at a North Cave Hills Site," which, by means of text and illustra- tions, explains how superimpositioning was used to establish a relative rock art chronology for that site. The second and largest part of the book is devoted primarily to the presenta- tion of 11 Northwestern Plains rock art traditions. Four of the traditions are new to this synthesis and three others are said to have received substantial documenta- tion only during the last decade. The 11 traditions, roughly from oldest to youngest, are: Early Hunting, Columbia Plateau, Dinwoody, En Toto Pecked, Pecked Abstract, Foothills Abstract, Hoof- print, Ceremonial, Biographic, Robe and Ledger Art, and Vertical Series. For each tradition, the authors provide: regional and continental distribution maps; a brief characterization of the tradition; a history of previous research; a detailed descrip- tion of the kinds of images and compo- sitional arrangements; a review of dating and chronology; an assessment of distri- butional and regional relationships; an attempt to determine cultural affiliations; and an interpretation of function and meaning. The art of each tradition is also well illustrated with elegant drawings and clear photographs. The second to last chapter of Part II contains a list of 15 rock art sites that have been developed for public visita- tion, plus a few museums whose collec- tions include rock art. This chapter ends with a plea for conservation. The final chapter of the book, entitled "Summary and Conclusions," indicates that stylistic diversity is what distinguishes North- western Plains rock art from that of most adjoining regions; only the Ameri- can Southwest has greater stylistic varia- tion. Northwestern Plains rock art is said to reflect nearly every aspect of Plains Indian life, from hunting, to instruc- PLAINS INDIAN ROCK ART • 200 tion of young hunters in hunting prac- tices and rituals, to vision and medicine quests, to mythology, to relationships between men and women, to family por- traits, to shamanism, initiation rituals, fertility rituals, combat records, arrival of horses and guns, and so forth. The book ends with an attempt to group the 11 Northwestern Plains traditions into four macrotraditions: Western Archaic, Eastern Woodland, Northwestern Plains, and Northwest Montane. In spite of its obvious relationship to past Aboriginal experience, rock art has tended to remain outside the main- stream of Northwestern Plains archaeol- ogy (cf. Frison 1978: 405; Francis 1991: 398-399). Two critical reasons for this isolation are the difficulties experienced in dating the art and in interpreting its meaning. In the absence of absolute dating methods, researchers generally have not been able to associate rock art with archaeological materials of known age in the same region, except for art of the historic period whose subject matter (e.g., horses, guns) was an indicator of age. This meant that rock art had little to contribute to one of archaeology's principal concerns - chronology. Fur- thermore, interpretations have tended to be speculative and beyond verifica- tion. It was widely believed that the symbolism employed was individualis- tic, that rock art could only be deci- phered by the individual who created it, and perhaps by other members of his/her community. Given these prob- lems, together with classification dif- ficulties and a spotty knowledge of the true extent of rock art site distribu- tion and content, it is no surprise that archaeologists have tended to give the subject only scant attention. With the publication of Plains Indian Rock Art, that may change. In one grand Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 26 (2002)</page><page sequence="3">201 • DYCK attempt, Keyser and Klassen have man- aged to tie credibly interpreted rock art styles and traditions to every major era of the Northwestern Plains archaeolog- ical sequence. Their work is built on an accumulation of many other stud- ies, which are duly acknowledged in the text. During the past 15 years there have been major advances in temporal anal- ysis, principally by the application of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating and cation ratio (CR) dating. Combined with older meth- ods, these have finally allowed the construction of fairly secure rock art chronologies. In addition, there have been advances in interpretive method and theory. Stylistic classification and analysis have become more potent. The- oretical approaches, such as the use of neuropsychological universals, contex- tual analysis and traditional explanations, especially when used in combination with one another, have shown that cred- ible (testable) interpretations of rock art are possible. With the accumulation of scattered advances in Plains rock art studies over the past decade, a general synthesis was certainly timely. And that, to their great credit, is what Keyser and Klassen have achieved. This is a dense book, full of interest- ing ideas and information. In general, it is well written, but it has not been care- fully polished. In several places there are misfits between text and associated illustrations. For example, the text on page 3 talks about 1,200 rock art sites and refers the reader to Map 1.1. How- ever, that map shows the locations of only 31 major rock art sites. Elsewhere, the text on page 78 refers to five dogs and one possible cougar as shown in Fig. 6.2. But when one turns to that figure, only one possible dog, and no cougars, can be seen. On page 183, the prob- Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26 (2002) lem is simpler; Fig. 12.6 is miscited as Fig. 12.4. I also noted a few errors in fact. For example, the La Vérendrye brothers were not the first Europeans to directly contact Plains Indians in the region (p. 53); that honour belongs to Henry Kelsey. Moreover, the first fur trade posts established on the Plains (proper) portion of the South Saskatch- ewan River (p. 53) date not from the 1820s but to 1800. In addition, written records pertaining to the Northern Plains (p. 59) cover not just the last 150 years, but actually the last 300 years. And if one is listing Northern Plains tribal confederacies (p. 62), the one that existed between Assiniboines and Crees was extremely important and should not have been excluded. I would also challenge some defini- tions and usages in the book. It strikes me, for example, that the definition used for Plains rock art should include not only petroglyphs and pictographs, but also petroforms. In areas of the Plains where rock outcrops suitable for petro- glyphs and pictographs are rare, the cre- ation of petroforms offered an alternative mode of artistic expression. Since some petroform styles are similar in form and subject, if not in size, to those described by Keyser and Klassen, the exclusion of this class of art seems unwarranted. At the same time, the inclusion of robe and ledger art among rock art traditions rep- resents a kind of fuzzy thinking. While it is very clear that such art is highly compa- rable to some of that which was pecked, scratched, and painted onto rock surfaces (and therefore is valuable for compara- tive and interpretive purposes) , still it is not rock art and should not be included among rock art traditions as Keyser and Klassen have chosen to do. Although there are a number of weak spots in this synthesis, my overall impres-</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS INDIAN ROCK ART • 202 sion is very favourable. The scale of cover- age is greater than anything attempted before in the Great Plains; the work of classification, documentation, contex- tualization, and interpretation is truly impressive. Indeed, some of the weak- nesses may be considered consequences of intellectual stretching and creativity by the authors, yet the results make very demanding reading. Consequently, I think that the authors' main goal - to reach past rock art enthusiasts to an inter- ested public - may have exceeded their grasp. Nevertheless, I also believe that archaeologists who take the time to read this volume carefully will find that rock art now has an important place in the study of Plains archaeology.
