Introduction: the context of these essays GRONBAUM, Adolf Simultaneity by slow clock transport in the special theory of relativity SALMON, Wesley C. The Conventionality of simultaneity After describing a new method of synchronising spatially separated clocks by means of clock transport, this paper discusses the philosophical import of the existence of such methods, including those of Ellis and Bowman and of Bridgman, with special reference to the Ellis-Bowman claim that "the thesis of the conventionality of distant simultaneity . . . is thus either trivialized or refuted." I argue that the physical facts do not support this philosophical con- clusion, and that a substantial part of their argument against Reichenbach, in particular, is misdirected. Finally, I suggest that Ellis and Bowman employ seriously unclear notions of triviality and "good physical reasons" that tend to obscure rather than clarify the basic philosophical issues. An objective criterion of nontriviality of conventions is advanced. van FRAASSEN, Bas C. Conventionality in the axiomatic foundations of the special theory of relativity In this paper we examine Ellis and Bowman's argument, that simultaneity in inertial frames of reference is not conventional, from the axiomatic point of view. In Part I we examine the role of conventions in an axiomatic physical theory, and in Part II the relation of simultaneity in Reichenbach's axiomatis- ation of the space-time theory of special relativity. JANIS, Allen I. Synchronism by slow transport of clocks in noninertial frames of reference The demonstration that slow transport of clocks can be used to define simul- taneity in inertial frames of reference leads to the question of whether clock transport can similarly be used in noninertial frames. It is shown that there are certain types of reference frames in which the clock-transport method cannot be used in a self-consistent manner. It is also shown that there are other types of noninertial frames in which the clock-transport method will succeed. The discussion includes noninertial frames in flat space-time as well as the case of curved space-times. FEYERABEND, Paul K. On a recent critique of complementarity: Part II</page><page sequence="2">84 Abstracts Philosophy of Science, 36 (1969), No. 2 SCHICK, Frederic Arrow's proof and the logic of preference This paper is a critique of Kenneth Arrow's thesis concerning the logical impossibility of a constitution. I argue that one of the premises of Arrow's proof, that of the transitivity of difference, is untenable. Several concepts of preference are introduced and counter- instances are offered to the transitivity of indifference defined along the standard lines in terms of these concepts. Alternate analyses of indifference in terms of preference are considered, and it is shown that these do not serve Arrow's purposes either. Finally, it is argued that in the single special case in which indifference could plausibly be held to be transitive, Arrow's thesis is innocuous. KRIPS, H. P. Two paradoxes in quantum mechanics The purpose of this paper is to resolve two paradoxes, which occur in quantum theory, by using the discussion of the theory of measurement presented in two earlier papers by the author. The two paradoxes discussed will be the Schr6dinger cat paradox and the Einstein, Podolski, Rosen paradox. An introductory section will be included which summarises the relevant results from the author's previous papers. Also a discussion will be made regarding the author's interpretation of the density operator. CORCORAN, John Three logical theories This study concerns logical systems considered as theories. By searching for the problems which the traditionally given systems may reasonably be intended to solve, we clarify the rationales for the adequacy criteria commonly applied to logical systems. From this point of view there appear to be three basic types of logical systems: those concerned with logical truth; those concerned with logical truth and with logical consequence; and those concerned with deduction per se as well as with logical truth and logical consequence. Adequacy criteria for systems of the first two types include: effectiveness, soundness, completeness, Post completeness, "strong soundness" and strong completeness. Considera- tion of a logical system as a theory of deduction leads us to attempt to formulate two adequacy criteria for systems of proofs. The first deals with the concept of rigor or "gap- lessness" in proofs. The second is a completeness condition for a system of proofs. An historical note at the end of the paper suggests a remarkable parallel between the above hierarchy of systems and the actual historical development of this area of logic. KELLEY, Hillary Jay Entropy of knowledge Entropy is proposed as a concept which in its broader scope can contribute to the study of the General Information System. This paper attempts to identify a few fundamental subconcepts and LEMMAS which will serve to facilitate further study of system order. The paper discusses: partitioning order into logical and arbitrary kinds; the relationship of order to pattern; and suggested approaches to evaluating and improving the General Information System. Philosophy of Science, 36 (1969), No. 3 HUNT, I. E. and SUCHTING, W. A. Force and "natural motion" Brian Ellis has argued that the assigning of forces is, in the final analysis, a matter of con- vention. This conclusion is backed by the premises (I) that forces and force-effects are necessary and sufficient for each other, and (2) that the classification of some state of affairs as a force-effect is at least partly conventional. We argue that the first premise is false, that the second premise is ambiguous as between several senses of 'conventional,' and finally that he has not established that force-effects are conventional in the sense required for the conclusion he wishes to draw.</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 85 CAUSEY, Robert L. Derived measurement, dimensions and dimensional analysis This paper presents a representational theory of derived physical measurements. The theory proceeds from a formal definition of a class of similar systems. It is shown that such a class of systems possesses a natural proportionality structure. A derived measure of a class of systems is defined to be a proportionality-preserving representation whose values are n-tuples of positive real numbers. Therefore, the derived measures are measures of entire physical systems. The theory provides an interpretation of the dimensional para- meters in a large class of physical laws, and it accounts for the monomial dimensions of these parameters. It is also shown that a class of similar systems obeys a dimensionally invariant law, which one may safely subject to a dimensional analysis. ULLIAN, Joseph S. Is any set theory true? This paper draws its title from the recent symposium of which it was part: it attempts to respond to the question raised by that title, taking current work in set theory into account. To this end the paper contrasts set theory with number theory, examines a severe brand of set-theoretic realism that is suggested by a passage from Godel, and sketches a first-order way of looking at the results about competing extensions of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. A formalistic sentiment may be detectable in some portions of the paper. SCHAFFNER, Kenneth F. Correspondence rules The traditional role which correspondence rules, coordinating definitions, or semantical rules, have in a logical analysis of a scientific theory is questioned by providing an alter- native analysis. The alternative account suggests that scientific theories are "meaningful" prior to the establishment of correspondence rules, and that correspondence rules are introduced to permit explanation and testing in the "observational" sector. The role of models is briefly assessed in connection with this prior or "antecedent theoretical meaning," and a causal sequence analysis of a class of correspondence rules is presented which makes explicit the interdependence of scientific theories. WILsoN, Fred Explanation in Aristotle, Newton and Toulmin: Part I The claim that scientific explanation is deductive has been attacked on both systematic and historical grounds. This paper briefly defends the claim against the systematic attack. Essential to this defence is a distinction between perfect and imperfect explanation. This distinction is then used to illuminate the differences and similarities between Aristotelian (anthropomorphic) explanations of certain facts and those of classical mechanics. In particular, it is argued that when one attempts to fit classical mechanics into the Aristotelian framework the latter becomes structurally incoherent. It is suggested that this, together with the fact that classical mechanics embodied the first piece of perfect know- ledge, accounts, in part at least, for the historical fact of the rapid demise of the Aristotelian patterns as the new science developed. On the basis of this discussion, the inadequacies of the attack on the deductive model on historical grounds by Toulmin come to be seen. Philosophy of Science, 36 (1969), No. 4 A Panel Discussion of Griinbaum's Philosophy of Science MASSEY, Gerald J. Towards a clarification of Griinbaum's conception of an intrinsic metric Much of Grtinbaum's work may be regarded as a careful development and systematic elaboration of the Riemann-Poincard thesis of the conventionality of congruence, the thesis that the continuous manifolds of space, time, and</page><page sequence="4">86 Abstracts space-time are intrinsically metrically amorphous, i.e. are devoid of intrinsic metrics. Therefore, to appreciate Grinbaum's philosophical contributions, one must have a clear understanding of what he means by an intrinsic metric. The second and fourth sections of this paper are exegetical; in them we try to piece together, from his sundry remarks about intrinsic metrics, what Griinbaum means by the term 'intrinsic metric.' We shall argue that, the customary care- fulness and precision of Griinbaum's writings notwithstanding, there are residual unclarities and difficulties which beset his conception of an intrinsic metric. In the fifth section we shall propose an explication of Griinbaum's notion of an intrinsic metric which seems on the whole faithful to Griinbaum's intuitions and insights and which also seems capable of performing the philosophical services which his work demands of that notion. The third section is a digression on Zeno's metrical paradox of extension. van FRAASSEN, Bas C. On Massey's explication of Gruinbaum's conception of metric Professor Massey's exposition and analysis of Professor Griinbaum's writings on metric aspects of space seem to me both very helpful in understanding those writings and to contain a considerable original contribution to the subject. Nevertheless I would like to argue that there is an alternative to Massey's explication which seems to me more faithful to Griinbaum's remarks; it seems at least to have the virtue of not forcing Gruinbaum to reject the usual mathe- matical definitions of the notions used. EVANS, Melbourne G. On the falsity of the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis The Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, proposed as an explanation of the Michelson-Morley result, fails to account for the Kennedy-Thorndike result. Hence, Gruinbaum argues, the hypothesis has been falsified. However, the contraction hypothesis as formulated by Lorentz is false for the very fundamental reason that it entails a contradiction, namely, the consequence that light waves must have a variable velocity along what by definition is taken to be a rest length. Furthermore, the attempt to resolve this contradiction by coupling the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction with the hypothesis that clock rates are a function of velocity, is open to a sound, methodological objection. The Michelson-Morley result is fully satisfied, provided only that the lengths of the interferometer arms, in the longitudinal and transverse positions, are thought to be related to one another in a certain ratio, and this ratio may be interpreted as a contraction in both arms. Since the twofold contraction hypo- thesis suffices to explain both the Michelson-Morley and the Kennedy- Thorndike results, and since it entails no contradiction, there is no need to correct both the length of rods and the rate of clocks. Therefore, the combined clock-rod hypothesis, and with it the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, must be rejected. BARRETT, Robert On the conclusive falsification of scientific hypotheses Adolf Griinbaum has introduced into the literature, and several times revised and restated, a description of a putative crucial experiment. The outcome of this experiment is supposed to be the conclusive falsification of an hypothesis to the effect that the geometry of a certain region of space, or of a certain surface, is Euclidean. Hereafter, in the paper, I shall refer to this example experiment, in any and all of the different versions of it that Griinbaum has articulated, along with the argumentation with which he has supplemented it, as 'Grtinbaum's Falsification Example.' I will be concerned with all versions of the experiment itself, but only with the most recent supplementary argumentation that Grtin- baum has offered, since the ways in which this differs from earlier arguments</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts 87 reflect a taking into account, on Griinbaum's part, of points critics have raised and flaws that they have purported to find in some of those earlier arguments. These are three separate important theses against which one or another version of Griinbaum's Falsification Example may be taken to have been directed. Each of these Grtinbaum has either explicitly claimed to refute or at least left himself open to the interpretation that he has sought to refute, by means of the example. I propose to try to make clear that none of these three theses is refuted, or even threatened with counterevidence, by Griinbaum's Falsification Example. WEDEKING, Gary Duhem, Quine and Gruinbaum on falsification In Chapter 4 of Philosophical Problems of Space and Time, Griinbaum sets out to refute Einstein's philosophy of physical geometry. The latter's theory is seen as lying within the tradition of "anti-empiricist conventionalism" of Duhem and Quine as opposed to the "qualified empiricism" of Poincar6, Carnap and Reichenbach. Consequently Griinbaum sets the stage for his critique of Einstein by discussing certain of the views of these other thinkers. But in these prelim- inary discussions the various theses are confused and misrepresented in such a way as to make it almost impossible to evaluate Grtinbaum's final treatment of Einstein's thesis. For this reason I will deal only with those parts of this chapter in which the roots of Grtinbaum's confusion are to be found. This will involve analyses of two theories which are not clearly distinguished by Grtinbaum. The first is Duhem's denial of the "crucial experiment" in physics; the second is Quine's version of "pragmatism." QUINN, Philip L. The status of the D-thesis Some of the controversy surrounding the Duhemian claim that in science falsification is as inconclusive as verification is reconsidered. The D-Thesis, a particular version of this claim first discussed by Adolf Gruinbaum, is formulated in a more precise and perspicuous fashion as a conjunction of two subtheses. Grtinbaum's attempt to refute one of the subtheses by means of a geometrical counterexample and some subsequent discussions of this example are examined critically. An argument designed to prove the other subthesis is analysed and shown to be unsuccessful. It is concluded that the D-Thesis is as yet neither proven nor refuted. WILSON, Fred Explanation in Aristotle, Newton and Toulmin: Part II Synthese, 2o (1969), No. 3 LEVI, Isaac Are statistical hypotheses covering laws? HANNA, Joseph F. Explanation, prediction, description and information theory The distinction between explanation and prediction has received much attention in recent literature, but the equally important distinction between explanation and descrip- tion (or between prediction and description) remains blurred. This latter distinction is particularly important in the social sciences, where probabilistic models (or theories) often play dual roles as explanatory and descriptive devices. The distinction between explanation (or prediction) and description is explicated in the present paper in terms of information theory. The explanatory (or predictive) power of a probabilistic model is identified with information taken from (or transmitted by) the environment (e.g., the independent, experimentally manipulated variables), while the descriptive power of a</page><page sequence="6">88 Abstracts model reflects additional information taken from (or transmitted by) the data. Although information is usually transmitted by the data in the process of estimating parameters, it turns out that the number of free parameters is not a reliable index of transmitted information. Thus, the common practice of treating parameters as "degrees-of-freedom" in testing probabilistic models is questionable. Finally, this information-theoretic analysis of explanation, prediction, and description suggests ways of resolving some recent con- troversies surrounding the pragmatic aspects of explanation and the so-called structural identity thesis. ROSENKRANTZ, Roger D. On explanation Two main themes unify this following discussion of explanation. First, explanations are essentially more or less efficient ways of recoding data. Powerful models are characterised in part by the dramatic reduction in the number of information units required for data storage which they effect. In addition, such models are sensitive discriminators of possible experimental outcomes. But, secondly, explanations are not mere reductions of data. The two features are related by the fact that interpretability insures overdetermination of a model's parameters, and thereby insures efficient recoding of the data. As a con- sequence, the logic of explanation exhibits a dual dependence on the relative strength of the probabilistic connections between explanandum and explanans and on the entrench- ment or theoretical assimilability of the explanatory hypotheses. GIERE, Ronald N. Bayesian statistics and biased procedures A comparison of Neyman's theory of interval estimation with the corresponding sub- jective Bayesian theory of "credible intervals" shows that the Bayesian approach to the estimation of the statistical parameters allows experimental procedures which, from the orthodox objective viewpoint, are clearly biased and clearly inadmissible. This demon- strated methodological difference focuses attention on the key difference in the two general theories, namely, that the orthodox theory is supposed to provide a known average fre- quency of successful estimates, whereas the Bayesian account provides only a coherent ordering of degrees of belief and a subsequent maximisation of subjective expected utilities. To rebut the charge of allowing biased procedures, the Bayesian mustattackthe foundations of orthodox, objectivist methods. Two apparently popular avenues of attack are briefly considered and found wanting. The first is that orthodox methods fail to apply to the single case. The second is that orthodox methods are subject to a typical Humean regress. The conclusion is that orthodox objectivist methods remain viable in the face of the subjective Bayesian alternative-at least with respect to the problem of statistical estim- ation. MACKLIN, Ruth Explanation and action: recent issues and controversies The paper surveys the recent philosophical literature on the topic of explanation of action. The issues are set forth in the form of a series of controversies between two opposing groups of philosophers, termed "the philosophical psychologists" and "the philosophers of science." The former group maintains that it is a mistake to look for causes of action and that hence, causal explanations of human action are not possible. Writers in the second group oppose this view, holding that the appropriate pattern of explanation for human action is similar to that found in the natural sciences and that an objective science of psychology is possible. Synthese, 2o (I969), No. 4 WOLD, Herman O. Mergers of economics and philosophy of science. A cruise in deep seas and shallow waters The developments of economics-econometrics since 1900oo have brought an array of fundamental innovations in the methods of nonexperimental model building. These</page><page sequence="7">Abstracts 89 innovations call for a partial reorientation of philosophy of science with its traditional affinity to natural science and experimental method. The situation is reviewed with special regard to the notions of model and cause-effect relationship, two key concepts in econo- metric research. The author emphasises the unity of scientific method as well as the need for specialised approaches to take into account the deepgoing differences in ends and means of model building that are marked by the twofold distinction between descriptive vs. causal-explanatory aims and experimental vs. nonexperimental observations. MARSHAK, Jakob On econometric tools It is common to all inductive studies that certain hypotheses are tested by facts while some "prior" assumptions (variously called 'specification,' 'model,' 'maintained hypo- theses') are not subjected to the test. But it distinguishes today's empirical economics (in degree, not in essence) that (I) the economist's "prior" assumptions are mostly based on "commonsense," sometimes on supporting field surveys, and almost never on controlled experiment; and (2) his results are generally expected to be useful for practical policy. The joint occurrence of these two characteristics creates the problem of estimating "structural functions" which describe in probability terms how each economic action variable (actions of consumers, producers, lenders, etc.) is determined by other such variables as well as by changes in environment; the latter includes changes in policies. FISHER, Franklin M. Causation and specification in economic theory and econometrics At the level of the individual decision-maker, causation in economics is generally con- sidered a matter of stimuli and responses with prices taken as given and quantities ad- justed. The lack of a good disequilibrium theory of price adjustment, however, has led to a blurring of the causal mechanism at the market level. Such blurring occurs in simul- taneous equation econometric models in which some variables apparently simultaneously cause each other. If one considers such models as limiting cases of nonsimultaneous ones with very short time lags between stimulus and response, fairly strong consequences as to the admissibility of models can be adduced. HANSSON, Bengt Voting and group decision functions This paper generalises Kenneth J. Arrow's well-known theorem about the impossibility of finding a rule which aggregates several person's preference orderings to an ordering representative of the group. It is here only required that the rule yields a group choice, which may be a single alternative or a set of alternatives (to reflect the case of a tie). Arrow's axioms are translated accordingly and it is proved that the impossibility result still holds in this more general framework. It is also proved that the theorem in 'Group Preferences' (Econometrica 37 (1969), pp. 50-4) about difficulties in finding rules which are neutral between both persons and alternatives admits a similar generalisation.</page></plain_text>
