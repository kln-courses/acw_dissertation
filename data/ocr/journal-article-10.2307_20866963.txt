<plain_text><page sequence="1">Uneasy Anthropocentrism: Cartesianism and the Ethics of Species Differentiation in Seventeenth-Century France An 1637, Rene Descartes declared in his Discours de la methode that animals have neither, emotions, reason, nor immortal souls, and that all of their actions are but reflexes of "la nature qui agit en eux, selon la disposition de leurs organes: ainsi qu'on voit qu'un horloge, qui n 'est compose que de roues et de ressorts peut compter les heures" ("the nature that works in them according to the disposition of their organs, just as one sees that a clock, which is made up only of wheels and springs, can count the hours"; (94).1 In the academic structure of so-called "French Classicism," the well-known notion of Descartes' "bete-ma chine" (animal-machine) has largely grounded the view that in seven teenth-century France, humans regarded nonhuman animals as soulless creatures created by God for their use, entertainment, and consumption.2 However, closer examination reveals that early modern France was far from coldly Cartesian in its views on nonhuman animals. There was a strong contradictory current of widely held beliefs that generated dis courses exposing anxieties over species boundaries between human and nonhuman animals, their respective rights and moral obligations, and the ethics of humans eating nonhuman animals. This discussion will address the manifestation of these apprehensions in philosophy (including the writings of Descartes, and Montaigne), law (particularlyjuridical proceed ings against nonhuman animals), literature (such as the writings of Mme. d'Aulnoy and La Fontaine), and prescriptions concerning food. Early modern views on nonhuman animals were grounded in two traditions: the Judeo-Christian, which constructed a Biblical approbation for the exploitation and slaughter of animals, and classical philosophy.3 In Desmond Hosford jac 30.3-4 (2010)</page><page sequence="2">516 jac the teleology expounded by Plato in Timaeus, all of nature is animated by a world soul (46-51), and in the History of Animals, Aristotle stratifies this soul on three levels: plants, animals, and humans, a hierarchy that supposedly justifies the human use of animals since, according to Aristotle, although animals have some anthropomorphic characteristics, only hu mans have reason and the capacity for speech (56-67). This approach constitutes the imperative of difference, stressing that human and nonhu man animals differ in kind. On the other hand, Pythagoras developed the theory of metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, which required vegetarianism (Steiner 45-50); Diogenes the Cynic, according to Dio Chrysostom, contended that it was best not to eat or wear animals (259, 263); Menander posited that humans are the most unnatural of animals since they alone intentionally invent misfortune (244), a position taken up by Pliny the Elder (60); and Porphyry, also a believer in metempsychosis, explained that nonhuman animals can speak, although people cannot understand them, so they are indeed rational (110-12), a position defended by Plutarch (539-79). This second strain of thought favoring nonhuman animals constitutes the imperative of similarity, stresses difference in degree rather than kind, and anchors the notion of theriophily, a set of beliefs asserting that nonhuman animals are rational, better endowed by nature, and more moral than humans.4 In early modern France, one of the foremost representatives of the theriophilic tradition was Michel de Montaigne, and he insisted, as had Porphyry and Plutarch, on the communicative abilities of nonhuman animals, positing that one could hardly blame animals for the human inability to understand them. In the "Apology for Raimond Sebond," Montaigne attacks the Aristotelian position that human reason is of any real value in relation to nonhuman animals: la presomption est nostre maladie naturelle et d'origine. La plus calamiteuse et fraile de toutes les creatures, c'est I'homme, et quant et quant la plus orgeuilleuse? C 'est par la vanite de cette mesme imagination qu 'il s 'egale a Dieu. ..qu 'il se trie soy-mesme et separe de la presse des autres creatures, taille les parts aux animaux ses confreres et compaignons, et leur distribuetelle portion de facultez et de forces que bon luy semble. (452)</page><page sequence="3">Desmond Hosford Presumption is our natural and original malady. Man is the most wretched and frail of all creatures, and so too is he the most conceited. ... It is by the vanity of this very imagination that he equals himself to God... that he selects and separates himself from the throng of other creatures, cuts portions for the animals, his brethren and companions, and distributes to them whatever portion of faculties and abilities he sees fit. Characterizing human reason as "presumption," "vanity," and "malady," Montaigne refutes the demand for difference that would claim universal dominion over nonhuman animals. Humankind, according to Montaigne, has no right to separate itself from "the throng of other creatures," who, far from being inferior, are "brethren and companions." He asserts a demand for similarity by insisting, Ce defaut qui empesche la communication d'entre elles et nous, pourquoy n 'est il aussi bien a nous qu 'a elles? . . . Ce n 'est pas grandmerveille si nous ne les entendonspas; aussi ne faisons nous les Basques et les Troglodites. (453) This fault that hinders communication between them and us, why is it not equally ours as theirs?... It is no great wonder if we do not understand them, and neither do we understand Basques and Troglodytes. In other words, human reason does not necessarily permit the understand ing of all tongues, and animals cannot be blamed for a "fault that hinders communication" any more than a Frenchman who might not grasp foreign languages. But neither does it follow, according to Montaigne, that the foreigner is inferior and that the Frenchman may claim dominion over other nations or races (and by implication, nonhuman animals) based on linguistic difference. Adopting a theriophilic position, Montaigne emphasizes the similarities between human and nonhuman animals. As he observes in "De la cruaute" ("On Cruelty"), the moral implications of this stance are clear: y a 'il un certain respect qui nous attache. . . nous devons . . . la benignite aux autres creatures_IIy a quelque commerce entre elles et nous, et quelque obligation mutuelle. (435)</page><page sequence="4">518 jac There is a certain respect that attaches to us. . . . We owe . . . benevolence to other creatures. . . . There is some relationship between them and us, and some mutual obligation. "Benevolence" and "mutual obligation," which connect the species and favor the imperative of similarity, are what Descartes seeks to eradicate with his demand for difference in order to defend the questionable anthropocentrism without which his Cogito?which places not only the human, but the individual, as an extension of the divine, at the center of the universe?could not function. In 1649, Descartes declared in a letter to Henry More that"// n y a pas de prejuge auquel nous ne soyons tous plus accoutumes qu'a celui qui nous a persuades depuis notre enfance que les betes pensent" (1318) ("there is no prejudice to which we are not all more accustomed than that which has persuaded us since our childhood that beasts think"). The notion that nonhuman animals are capable of thought contradicts Cartesian philosophy, and in order to legitimize his anthropocentrism, Descartes claimed that the belief in animal reason, although widely accepted, was merely anthropomorphic, maintaining that human and nonhuman animals differ not only in degree but in kind. He continues: Aucune raison ne nous a pousses a croire cela si ce n 'est que, voyant la plupart des membres des betes, dans leur apparence et dans leurs mouvements, ni differer que peu des notres, et croyant d 'outrepart qu 'ily a en nous unprincipe unique de ces mouvements, savoir I 'dme, lameme pour mouvoir le corps et pour penser, nous n 'avons pas doute qu 'une telle dme ne se trouve chez les betes. (1318) No reason has led us to believe this other than seeing that most of the limbs of animals, in their appearance and their movements, do not differ from ours, and furthermore believing that there is in us a unique principle for these movements, namely the soul, the same for moving and thinking, we have not doubted that such a soul exists in animals. Descartes asserts that appearance does not prove similarity and that although animals (and automatons [1319]) seem to manifest signs implying</page><page sequence="5">Desmond Hosford 519 that they have the same type of souls as humans, they do not. He seeks to prove this by invoking Aristotle's argument that "aucun animal en soit venu a ce point de perfection d'user d'un veritable langage" (1320) ("no animal has arrived at the point of perfection of using a true language"). Attempting to refute the imperative of similarity, Descartes returns to the supposed primacy of language intelligible to humans, a notion that had already been disputed by Montaigne, denying signs that strongly suggest similarity between human and nonhuman animals and declaring that since animals cannot speak as humans do, "ceci temoigne non settlement que les betes ont moins de raison que les hommes, mais qu 'elles n 'en ont point du tout" (Discours 93) ("this proves not only that animals have less reason than humans, but that they have none at all"). Descartes' linguistic benchmark as the signifier of reason ultimately attaches to the notion that only humans have a thinking soul, and he explicitly distinguishes between what he perceives as differences be tween animal and human expression, asserting that bien que toutes nous signifient tres facilement lews impulsions naturelles, telles que la colere, la crainte, la faim, ou autres etats semblables... exprimer soit par lavoix, soit par les gestes quelque chose quipuisse se rapporter a la seulepensee et non a I 'impulsion naturelle... est en effet le seul signe certain d'unepensee latente dans le corps... c 'estpourquoi il estpermis deprendre le langage pour la vraie difference entre les hommes etles betes. (CEuvres 1320) although all of them easily indicate their natural impulsions to us, such as anger, fear, hunger, or other similar states ... expressing, be it by the voice or by gestures, something that can refer only to thought and not to natural impulsion... is really the only certain sign of underlying thought in the body ... this is why it is permissible to take language as the true difference between men and animals. Descartes claims that in order for a soul to prove that it thinks, it must be able to refer to thoughts that are independent of what he posits as "natural impulses," the mechanical, survival-oriented aspects of the body that motivate the "bete-machine."5 Asserting that nonhuman animals are unable to achieve this, Descartes seeks to bulwark the imperative of difference by attempting to substantiate a material difference between the</page><page sequence="6">520 jac souls of human and nonhuman animals, which he alleges is tied to the impetus behind corporeal action: // faut distinguer deux principes de mouvements; Vun tout mecanique et corporel, qui depend de la seule force des esprits animaux et de la seule conformation des membres, et quipeut etre appelle dme corporelle; Vautre incorporele, savoir Vesprit ou cette dme que j 'ai definie substance pensante. (CEuvres 1318) One must distinguish two principles of movement, one completely mechanical and corporeal, which depends on the sole force of animal spirits and the sole conformation of the limbs, and which may be called corporeal soul; the other incorporeal, namely the spirit or this soul that I have defined as thinking substance. In attempting to assert difference, Descartes argues that animal souls are material, part of their blood, unlike human souls, which he holds to be immaterial and immortal (Discours 90), a notion that he never was able to prove and which Cyrano de Bergerac parodies in the "Histoire des oiseaux" ("Story of the Birds") (471). Pierre Gassendi, whose Syntagma philosophicum stresses the consanguinity of all animals, seized upon this incongruity in his objection to Descartes' "Deuxieme meditation" ("Sec ond Meditation"), countering that the ostensibly judicious Cartesian method is irrational in denying nonhuman animals a soul evidenced by the apparent ability to feel and think. By exposing this flaw, Gassendi strikes at the foundations of Descartes' anthropocentric "presumption": La faculte de sentir que vous rangezparmi les modes de lapensee n 'estpas differente en I 'homme de ce qu 'elle est chez les betes; or, comme I 'dme des betes est materielle, celle de I 'hommepeut I 'etre aussi. (CEuvres 471) The ability to feel that you place among the modes of thought is no different in man than it is in animals, so, since the souls of animals are material, those of men may be so as well. Gassendi attacks Descartes' unverifiable claim that animals lack imma terial souls by stressing the evident human and nonhuman similarities in the "ability to feel," which, according to Cartesian logic, would either suggest</page><page sequence="7">Desmond Hosford 521 that human souls are also material, or that nonhuman animals have immaterial, immortal souls.6 Both of these possibilities would cast human kind from the self-proclaimed ascendancy that it seeks to impose over nonhuman animals. Entangled in his inability to prove the validity of his anthropocentrism and its demand for difference, Descartes was obliged to admit to More, Bien que je tienne pour demontre qu 'on ne peut prouver qu 'il y a une pensee chez les betes, je ne crois pas cependant qu 'on puisse demontrer qu 'il n'yenapas, parce que I 'esprit humain nepenetre pas leur cceur. (CEuvres 1319) Although I hold it to be demonstrated that one cannot prove that animals think, I do not believe, however, that one can demonstrate that they do not, because the human mind does not penetrate their heart. Cartesian anthropocentrism, largely untenable because it was rooted in a demand for difference that could not be sufficiently validated and against which there is weighty opposing evidence, was no solution to the anthropocentric dilemma, which also appeared in courts of law. One of the most troubled manifestations of uneasy anthropocentrism in early modern Europe is the persistence of juridical trials and the capital punishment of nonhuman animals. Surviving records of such trials date from the early ninth through the early twentieth centuries, and there were at least 43 cases from the beginning of the seventeenth century through 1715.7 Several cases involve prosecutions that hold human and nonhuman animals equally responsible for an alleged crime. Exemplary among such trials were those for bestiality, which, in the theological discourse of seventeenth-century France, was designated a type of sodomy, and as such was punishable by burning. Between 1540 and 1692, there were about 50 trials for bestiality in France, of which most ended at the stake for both the human and nonhuman transgressors (Lever 94-95). In 1601, Claudine de Culam, 16 years old, was tried and convicted in Paris for repeatedly engaging in sexual intercourse with her dog, some thing to which the girl confessed after both she and her pet had undergone medical inspection. Condemned to death, Claudine claimed to be pregnant, which claim was dismissed after further medical scrutiny. On October 15,</page><page sequence="8">522 jac 1601, the Parlement de Paris declared Culam "bien etdument atteinte et convaincue d'avoir eu habitation charnelle avec un chien blanc tachete de roux" (Lever 98) ("well and duly accused and convicted of having lived carnally with a white dog with reddish spots") and sentenced her "a etre pendue et etranglee avec ledit chien blanc tachete de roux. Apres quoi, leurs corps seront jetes au feu et leurs cendres semees au vent (Lever 98) ("to be hanged and strangled with the said white dog with reddish spots, after which their bodies will be thrown in the fire and their ashes strewn to the wind"). In 1606 at Chartres, Guillaume Guyart was convicted in absentia for copulating with his female dog. The court declared that: Pour reparation et punition duquel crime condempnons ledict Guyard estre pendu et estrangle a une potence_Et auparavant ladicte execution de mort, que ladicte chienne sera assommee par I 'executeur de la haute justice audict lieu, et seron les corps morts, tant dudict Guyard que de la dicte chienne brules et mis en cendres ....(Evans 296) For amend and punishment for which crime we condemn the said Guyard to be hanged and strangled at the gallows_And before the said execution, the said dog will be struck on the head by the executioner of high justice of the said place, and once they are dead, the bodies of the said Guyard and the said dog will be burned to ashes. .. . These two cases share several emblematic elements that, in their anthropomorphism, reveal the mutability of seventeenth-century anthropocentrism and conflict with Cartesian precepts. In both instances, each defendant is convicted of interspecies copulation, and the method of execution is the same for both of the condemned parties. The proceedings that led to these admonitions assert an anthropomorphism that, in theory, accords equal judicial status to the human and nonhuman defendants and which is apparently predicated on the assumption that all of the defendants are reasoning subjects capable of reflection and of consciously choosing to transgress. In this juridical context, the imperative for similarity is applied in a strange fashion since no one, not even Porphyry or Montaigne, ever argued that human and nonhuman animals are so alike that they are</page><page sequence="9">Desmond Hosford 523 subject to the same civil laws. Yet, such similarity is implicit in these cases, and the Ordre et instruction judiciare (Judiciary Order and Instruc tion) of Pierre Ayrault confirms that proceedings and sentences against nonhumans for acts deemed illegal for humans were not rare (289-90). In cases of bestiality, if the judge chose to show clemency, the condemned animal, human or nonhuman, might be singed and strangled before being burned, but woe to the nonhuman who objected to the sentence.8 In 1565 a mule, condemned to be burned with a man for sodomy, kicked the executioner, who proceeded to hack off the incalcitrant's hooves before inflicting the mortal castigation (Evans 146). Bestiality, as a form of sodomy, was condemned by religious doctrine, but the irony of this situation is that although the Bible, among the principal authorities for the imperative of difference, prescribes that dangerous animals (a designation that does not apply to the nonhumans prosecuted in recorded bestiality cases) be put to death, it does not accord equal judicial status to human and nonhuman animals since this would support the imperative for similarity, which Biblical dogma contravenes.9 The two imperatives were being confounded. Nathaniel Wolloch suggests that animal trials asserted the "anthropocentric attitude toward animals . . . which clearly emphasized humanity's authority and power over the animal world" (28). Although this may be true, the situation is more complex since it suggests that if nonhuman animals could be tried and condemned in exactly the same manner as humans, even as co-defendants, then there must be something human about them. Neutralizing anxiety over this possibility required the violent performative reassertion of the anthropo centric order, which was effectively achieved through judicial proceedings against and executions of nonhuman animals. Philosophical discourse and juridical records are not the only sources of evidence that seventeenth-century French culture was not, as a whole, characterized by Cartesian anthropocentrism. A large corpus of literature in all genres from the Satires of Nicolas Boileau, to the Fables of Jean de La Fontaine is characterized by anthropomorphism and theriophily. Such works may embody of generally-held attitudes toward nonhuman animals since, as Wolloch observes, "It seems safe to assume that people in the early modern era read and understood fictional literature more than philosophical or scientific works" (117). Among the most popular genres</page><page sequence="10">524 jac of seventeenth-century French literary fiction was the fairy tale with its endless varieties of anthropomorphism in which transformed subjects retain their human characteristics.11 La chatte blanche (1698) by Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville d'Aulnoy (1650?1705)is emblematic of the anthropomorphic fluidity typical of fairy tales and reveals the proximity of human and nonhuman animals in the popular imagination of seventeenth-century France. In this tale, a young prince seeks shelter in a mysterious castle deep in the woods, where: 77 vit entrer une petite figure, qui... se couvrait d'un long voile de crepe noir. . . s 'approcha &amp;, levant son voile, il apergut la plus belle petite chatte blanche. . . . Elle avait I'air fort jeune &amp; fort triste. (169) He saw a little figure enter, who... was covered with a long veil of black crepe ... he approached, and, lifting her veil, saw the most beautiful little white cat_She appeared very young and very sad. The cat, whose name is Blanchette, is always described in human terms, first, in her "veil of black crepe" appearing "very young and very sad," and later voluptuously "couchee... sur un matelas de satin blanc.... Elle avait des cornettes negligees ..." (176) ("reclining ... on a mattress of white satin . . . she wore an informal bonnet . . ."). The prince immediately addresses the cat in a combinative anthropomorphism as "Madame la chatte," and the cat proves to be bilingual, speaking French and cat, notably in her command "que les musiciens se taisent, car le prince n 'entendpas ce qu 'Us disent" (169) ("let the musicians be silent, because the prince does not understand what they are saying"). Despite the anthropocentric claims of Cartesian theory, of which Mme. d'Aulnoy was undoubtedly aware, this cat can reason in two languages, and, in the theriophilic tradition, just as Montaigne had asserted, it is not the fault of the nonhumans that the human cannot understand them.11 Indeed, the cat shows her reason to be superior to that of the prince. She recognizes the linguistic divide, and, rather than blaming the prince, chooses to speak to him in French, a politeness that he is unable to reciprocate by speaking the language of cats.</page><page sequence="11">Desmond Hosford 525 Blanchette exceeds Cartesian limits on nonhuman animals. She writes poetry and "etoit plus savante qu 'il n 'est pas permis a une chatte de Vetre" (107) ("was more learned than it was permitted for a cat to be"). Beyond her linguistic and reasoning abilities, Blanchette, also contrary to Cartesian precepts, experiences the same passions as humans, and "elk avait le cceur tendre &amp; que I 'on ne pouvait parler comme elle faisait sans aimer" (172) ("she had a tender heart, and one could not speak as she did without loving"). Here Aulnoy takes up the Cartesian notion that only language evinces the understanding required to experience emotions as humans do, and it is the manner in which Blanchette speaks that reveals her emotional capacity and her ability to address that which is not restricted to the Cartesian boundaries of the mechanically corporeal. The prince falls in love with the cat, but in order for the tale to achieve its required happy ending, Blanchette must become human. This is accomplished when the prince cuts off her head and tail, thereby breaking a spell and allowing the princess to assume her true form (184). In simplest terms, the prince's mutilation of Blanchette is a violent performative anthropocentric affirmation, but La chatte blanche, with its erotic theriophily and its fluid anthropomorphism, is perhaps the most problematic tale of its kind, revealing grey areas of seventeenth-century French anthropocentrism. Although one might argue in a Cartesian vein that the young man only fell in love with Blanchette's human qualities or that she was never really a cat at all, the fact remains that the prince had no way of knowing this. He fell deeply in love with what he believed to be a nonhuman animal, and at no point in the narrative is the propriety of such a thing questioned. Short of interspecies carnality, the prince sets no limit on his love for the cat, and his exclamation "Ou devenezfille ou rendez moi chat!" (173) ("Either become a girl, or make me a cat!") reveals a binary anthropomorphism that calls into question the notion of corporeality as a signifier of difference. The relation between the bodies of human and nonhuman animals is the subject of a series of studies by Charles Le Brun, Premier Peintre du Roy to Louis XIV, in which he explores the physical similarities between men and nonhuman animals (Figure 1). These studies maybe interpreted in two principal ways, the first of which is mentioned by Foucault in Les</page><page sequence="12">526 jac Figure 1: Charles Le Brun, "Trois tetes de corbeau; trois tetes" engraved by Andre* Le Grand for Louis-Marie-Joseph Morel d'Arleux, Dissertation sur un traite de Charles Le Brun concernant le rapport de la physionomie humaine avec celle des animaux. mots et les choses, where he observes that, "on peut decrire certaines formes assez complexes a partir de leur tres visible ressemblance avec le corps humain, qui sert comme de reserve aux modeles de la visibilite. ..." (147) ("one may describe certain rather complex forms beginning with their very visible resemblance to the human body, which serves as a reference for models of visibility").12 This humanistic ap proach to deciphering the material universe functions largely through self referential processes that privilege the human. Keith Tester offers a second possibility, turning Foucault' s argument around, and emphasizing species conjointure with the observation that "animals are useful for</page><page sequence="13">Desmond Hosford 527 humans to be able to think human" (48), which is what Le Brun is arguably doing in his anthropomorphic or reverse anthropomorphic studies where the nonhuman characteristics of the human subjects are more discernable than the human qualities of the nonhuman subjects. Cartesian philosophy denies the validity of human signifiers in nonhuman animals and their behavior, but Le Brun confirms signs of the nonhuman in the human, which effectively upholds the imperative of similarity and illustrates species proximity. The prevalence of the imperative of similarity evidenced by Le Brun and Aulnoy informs the interpretation of seventeenth-century French prescriptions concerning meat. According to the anonymous Art de bien traiter (1674), "La delicatesse comprend la fine exquise maniere d'appreter les viandes" (173) ("delicacy comprises the fine exquisite manner of preparing meats"). One's manner of approaching meat was an indicator of sociability, "delicatesse," and, according to comportment treatises including the Nouveau traite de la civilite by Antoinede Courtin, touching meat with the hands was always forbidden, from the moment of the kill, when, at least in the hunt, hounds and servants are employed, to carving and eating, which must be accomplished solely with knives and forks (162). Beyond the prescription not to touch meant, the act of carving is significant. Norbert Elias notes in The History of Manners that during the seventeenth century in France, the practice of carving entire animals at noble tables ceased, and reminders that the meat dish has something to do with the killing of an animal are avoided to the utmost. . . . The animal form is so concealed and changed by the art of its preparation that while eating one is scarcely reminded of its origin... the curve running from the carving of a large part of the animal or even the whole animal at table, through the advance in the threshold of repugnance at the sight of dead animals, to the removal of carving to specialized enclaves behind the scenes is a typical civilization curve. (120) The artful preparation of food, which prevents the appearance of the recognizable animal form at table, may signal nervousness over degree in species differentiation. In La chatte blanche, the prince was loathe to kill the cat because she was human enough for him to love her passionately,</page><page sequence="14">528 jac and Le Brun's sketches show how easily human and nonhuman animals may be conflated. In this context, squeamishness over the carving of animal bodies, which, as Descartes observed, were widely recognized as having something human about them, is logical. Therefore, delicatesse required that the butchered victim no longer be recognizable as such, and early modern French culinary art was largely devoted to disguising corpses. This trait fits the patterns observed by Claude Levi-Strauss in Le cru et le cuit (The Raw and the Cooked), which indicate that the cooked is a hallmark of civilization. According to Levi-Strauss, "The raw/cooked axis is characteristic of culture... since cooking brings about the cultural transformation of the raw" (142). Particularly in early modern France, care was taken to disguise the flesh of nonhuman animals being served as food, and Elias posits that "people, in the course of the civilizing process, seek to suppress in themselves every characteristic that they feel to be ' animal.' They likewise suppress such characteristics in their food" (119). Suppressing animal characteristics in human food, making its forms less able to be interpreted as human-like through self-referential observation, invokes the imperative of difference, which grounds the "bete-machine" theory through which Descartes claims that he intends to ease anthro pocentric anxiety: Si bien que mon opnion est moins cruelle envers les betes qu 'elle n 'est pieuse envers les hommes qui ne sont plus asservis a la superstition the Pythagoras et qui sont delivres du soupgon de crime toutes les fois qu 'Us mangent ou tuent les animaux. (CEuvres 1320) Really my position is less cruel towards animals than it is kind to humans who are no longer subj ect to the superstition of Pythagoras, and who are delivered from the suspicion of crime every time that they eat or kill animals. Descartes' preoccupation with affirming the imperative of difference reveals his own uneasy anthropocentrism. Ironically, Descartes was primarily vegetarian, for health rather than ethical reasons (Stuart 135), but he was an active vivisectionist and apparently needed anthropocentric affirmation to absolve him of killing animals.13</page><page sequence="15">Desmond Hosford 529 Figure 2: "La folie des hommes ou le monde a rebours" Paris: Musee des Civilisations de l'Europe et de laM6diterranee. Credit: Reunion des Musies Nationaux, Art Resource, New York. Another indication of uneasy anthropocentrism in seventeenth-century France is the depiction of a "monde renverse" ("upside-down world"). As Mikhail Bakhtin has shown in a medieval context, carnavalesque inversion often has weighty anthropological functions, among which is alleviating fear of the unknown: The acute awareness of victory over fear is an essential element of medieval laughter. This feeling is expressed in a number of char acteristic medieval comic images. We always find in them the defeat</page><page sequence="16">530 jac of fear presented in a droll and monstrous form, the symbols of power and violence turned inside out, the comic images of death and bodies gaily rent asunder. (91) Mocking that which might be possible effectively reduces its menace, and as a support for the imperative of difference, this reaffirms the perception of anthropocentric dominion. Nevertheless, foreboding over the ethical and practical tenability of this stance is what reveals the human trepidation over species proximity and the imperative of similarity. Such is the case with the anonymous "Folie des hommes ou le monde a rebours" in which humans are forced to do hard labor, used for sport, hunted, killed, butchered, and roasted by nonhuman animals (see Figure 2). Some of the images (such as the horses riding men to joust and the horse shoeing the man) are perhaps meant to be humorous, but others (including the goat roasting a man and the steer preparing to halve the butcher) might seem particularly gruesome to the anthropocentric. However, all of these images exemplify popular culture alleviating its distress over the impera tive of similarity. Although some might propose that the "monde renverse" images are strictly comic, no such claim may be asserted for a scene from Thesee by Philippe Quinault and Jean-Baptiste Lully, a tragedie en musique. In Lully' s mature works, including Thesee, this genre admits no comedy.14 In act 5, scene 6, as Medee flies from the flaming palace in her dragon chariot, "les Mets du Festin prepare se convertissent en des Animaux horribles" (167) ("the food prepared for the feast changes into horrible animals"). If human and nonhuman animals are separated only by degree, then it might be unethical for someone to eat "the animals, his brethren and compan ions," which would explain the development of culinary art as a disguiser of corpses. The feast scene from Thesee achieves its dramatic effect by invoking anxiety over species boundaries and the ethics of humans eating nonhuman animals. If humans can eat nonhumans who are essentially similar to themselves, then the situation can be reversed, and being devoured by one's dinner would be an anthropocentric horror.15 Although Descartes rejected the imperative of similarity, his may not have been the dominant view of nonhuman animals in seventeenth century France where the imperative of difference and its attendant human claim to dominion were frequently challenged. Among the best</page><page sequence="17">Desmond Hosford 531 known seventeenth-century French literary works involving animals are the fables of La Fontaine. Although they are fundamentally anthropomor phic rather than theriophilic (many of the animals are essentially meta phorical), the representation of speaking, reasoning nonhumans in the fables favors scenarios that not only permit humans "to be able to think human," but which invite discourse addressing the relative moral status of human and nonhuman animals. In the "Discours a Madame de la Sabliere" ("Discourse to Madame de la Sabliere"), which precedes "Les deux rats, le renard et l'oeuf' ("The Two Rats, the Fox, and the Egg") in the ninth book of fables, La Fontaine attacks Descartes and his anthropocentrism: Ils disent done Que la bete est une machine; Qu 'en elle tout se fait sans choix et par ressorts: Nul sentiment, point d'dme, en elle tout est corps. Telle est la montre qui chemine, A pas toujours egaux, aveugle et sans dessein. L 'impression se fait. Mais comment se fait-elle? Selon eux, par necessite, Sans passion, sans volonte: L 'animal se sent agite De mouvements que le vulgaire appelle Tristesse, joie, amour, plaisir, douleur cruelle, Ou quelque autre de ces etats. Mais ce n 'est point cela: ne vous y trompez pas. Qu'est-ce done? Une montre. Et nous? C'est autre chose. Void de la faqon que Descartes Vexpose .... (237) So they say That the beast is a machine; That in it all passes without choice and by springs: No feeling, no soul, in it all is body.

According to them, by necessity, Without passion, without will, The animal feels itself agitated By movements that the vulgar call Sadness, joy, love, pleasure, cruel pain, Or some other such state. But it is not so: do not fool yourself. What is it then? A watch. And us? That is something else. Here is the manner in which Descartes explains it... . La Fontaine sarcastically summarizes the imperative of difference, decrying its self-proclaimed logic and denouncing its exponent, Descartes. He provides many examples of reasoning among nonhuman animals (23 8 40) and perhaps gestures to Montaigne by objecting to the "presumption" of the Cogito, which accords dominion to man who "selects and separates himself from the throng of other creatures" based on the anthropocentric claim: "Sur tons les animaux enfants du Createur, / J'ai le don de penser, et je sais que je pense" (238) ("Above all the animals, children of the Creator,/I have the gift of thinking, and I know that I think"). The "Discours a Madame de la Sabliere" is a summary of La Fontaine' s opposition to the arrogance of Cartesian anthropocentrism, and he illustrates this objection through his fables. A paradigmatic example is "L'homme et la couleuvre" in which a man, without having been provoked, captures a serpent, ties him in a sack, and, "On resolut samort, fut-il coupable ou non" (243) ("Condemned him to death, whether he was guilty or not"). Responding to the man's accusations of ingratitude and cruelty, the serpent responds: Toy-mesme tu te fais ton proces. Je me fonde Sur tes propres legons; jette les yeux sur toy. Mes jours sont en tes mains, tranche les: ta justice C'est ton utilite, ton plaisir, ton caprice; Selon ces loix condamne-moy: Mais trouve-bon qu'avec franchise En mourant je te dise,</page><page sequence="19">Desmond Hosford 533 Que le symbole des ingrats Ce n'est point le serpent, c'est I'homme. (243) You yourself make your trial. I base myself On your own lessons; casts your eyes upon yourself. My life is in your hands, sever it: your justice Is your utility, your pleasure, your caprice; Condemn me according to these laws: But see fit that frankly In dying I say to you That the symbol of ingrates Is not the serpent, it is man. La Fontaine invokes the imperative of difference, but his strategy is the opposite of Descartes'. Instead of privileging human reason (the man condemns the serpent without just cause), La Fontaine's serpent (along with a cow, a bull, and a tree who also testify to their mistreatment by humans) questions the morality of human dominion. The serpent contends that human law is grounded on personal utility, pleasure, and caprice, thus implying that it lacks ethical authority, an accusation that La Fontaine confirms: L 'Homme trouvant mauvais que I 'on I 'eut convaincu, Voulut a toute force avoir cause gagnee. Je suis bien bon, dit-il, d'ecouter ces gens-la. Du sac et du serpent aussitot il donna Contre les murs, tant qu 'il tua la bete. (245) The man, finding it bad that one would have convinced him, Wanted most strongly to win the case. I am very good, he said, to listen to those people. The sack and the serpent he struck Against the walls until he killed the beast. La Fontaine reverses Cartesian theory by referring to the cow, the bull, and the tree as "those people," which, by conferring personhood on the nonhumans, theoretically follows on and confirms their ability to reason. The man evidences no such aptitude, thus surrendering his alleged</page><page sequence="20">534 jac Cartesian superiority, recalling the tradition of the "monde renverse." Violent reassertion of the anthropocentric order is apparently achieved through the killing of the serpent, but this act ironically substantiates the imperative of difference in a strategy counter to that of Cartesianism and its antecedents. In La Fontaine's inverted discourse, the imperative of difference is invoked in favor of the nonhuman animals, essentially condemning anthropocentrism as brutish, unreasoning, and unjust. Although early modern France as a whole cannot be characterized as theriophilic, and human ascendancy was accepted as a natural part of life, there was an underlying anxiety over boundaries between human and nonhuman species. Despite Descartes' determined efforts to assert an imperative of difference that would justify universal human dominion, discourses of philosophy, law, visual art, civility, and literature deploy strong arguments for the opposing imperative of similarity, which may have been more deeply rooted in the popular mind, and which grounded the uneasy anthropocentrism that characterized much of seventeenth-cen tury France.

Although the notion of an epoch-defining seventeenth-century French "Classicism" is deeply entrenched in canonic academic discourse, the validity of the premise has been challenged, notably by Stanton. 3. Among the first Biblical texts often interpreted as such an approbation is Genesis 9:3: "Everything that lives and moves will be food for you" (18). For a discussion of Greco-Roman thought on nonhuman animals, see Steiner 38-111. 4. I draw these fundamental imperatives of human-animal relations from Tester, who articulates the notions of the "Demand for Difference" and the "Demand for Similitude," which ground his work on the status of animals in human society(88-93). 5. Descartes discusses at length the division of the mechanical human body (which parallelshis description of the "bete-machine") and the feeling, reasoning human soul in Les passions de I 'ante (1646-49). 6. According to Descartes, signs of nonhuman animal pleasure or suffering</page><page sequence="21">Desmond Hosford 535 do not reveal a human-like ability to feel because that capacity exists only in understanding, which, according to Descartes, nonhuman animals lack. Descartes explains this notion in a letter to Marin Mersenne in 1640 (CEuvres 1421). For a discussion of "Descartes on the Question of Feeling in Animals," see Steiner 144-48. 7. A chronological annotated chart of animal trials in Europe from 824 to 1906 is provided in Evans 265-86. Evans notes that there are also earlier references to such proceedings dating back at least to the seventh century. 8. Lever suggests that this practice stemmed from ethical religious concerns since, as Julius Clarus posited in the sixteenth century, a slow death by burning might lead the victim into despair that repentance would save his soul. Strangling nonhuman animals before burning them may have stemmed from humane con cerns, since animals were not deemed to have immortal souls capable of reason, a position that nonetheless conflicts with their implication in judicial proceedings (52). 9. See, for example, Genesis 9:5, "And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal" (18); and Exodus 21:28-9, "If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull must be stoned to death"(118). 10. Although I emphasize that human subjects changed into nonhuman animals remain fundamentally unchanged in their modes of behavior, there are also examples of nonhumans assuming human form, but retaining their natural habits. One example is La Fontaine's "La chatte metamorphosee enfemme" ("The Cat Metamorphosed into a Woman") from the second book of Fables (67-68), in which a cat, taking the form of a woman and seeming entirely human, nevertheless continues to hunt mice on her hands and knees. 11. For biographical information on Mme. d'Aulnoy, see Jyl. On Aulnoy's strategies to contravene Cartesian notions of the body, see Hannon 78-121. 12. Foucault never explored the continuity of human and nonhuman species in a meaningful way, beyond linking animality to madness. See Palmer. 13. For an overview of Descartes and vivisection, see Rupke 24-28. 14. On the tragedies en musique of Lully and Quinault, see Beaussant. 15. This is not to suggest that either Quinault or Lully favored the imperative of similarity or were themselves squeamish about eating nonhuman animals, only that they engage a deep-seated cultural uneasiness to incite horror in their audience. That such a strategy could have been deployed at a dramatic climax in a theatrical work suggests that it was indeed well established and wide spread.</page><page sequence="22">536 jac Works Cited Aristotle.
