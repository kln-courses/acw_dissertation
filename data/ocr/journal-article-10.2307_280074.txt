LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA The last area report for Lower Central America was published in July 1979. This summary will make up for the discontinuity by referring to projects undertaken over the last two years. Once again, no news is available from Nicaragua. COSTA RICA. The Museo Nacional de Costa Rica (Michael J. Snarskis, Director of Archaeological Research; Hector Gamboa, Administrative Director, Department of Anthropology and History) is contin- uing its national salvage program in several regions, aided by financing from the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo, the Instituto Costarricense de Electri- cidad (ICE), and a number of private companies and institutions. Recently graduated Costa Rican archae- ologists are beginning to assume supervisory research responsibilities, an indication of the effec- tiveness of the museum's training program. In the Bay of Culebra the survey and salvage proj- ect begun by Frederick Lange in 1973 and ac- celerated by the commencement of a major govern- ment tourist venture, continued under the direction of Silvia Salgado with the recording by 1979 of over 60 sites, and major exacavations at Nacascolo and Salinas. At Nacascolo, where Accola and Wallace had worked in 1978, Ricardo Vasquez and Silvia Salgado (Museo Nacional "MN") recovered shell mid- dens, domestic features, and cemeteries. The site was systematically tested by using a stratified sam- pling plan based on topography; temporal changes in the settlement pattern were observed, hearths and oven features of fired adobe were mapped, and a well-preserved sample of skeletons recovered. Vas- quez is himself undertaking the physical anthropolog- ical study of some 30 individuals. An adjunct team from the University of California at Los Angeles, under the direction of Brian Dillon, is aiding Vasquez and Salgado at the Nacascolo site. At the neighboring Salinas site (Playa Panama), Silvia Salgado G., Marlin Calvo M., and Leidy Bonilla V. conducted excavations in a deposit consisting of nine artificial mounds of different sizes, located near an alvina. As this important shore-line locality was due to be destroyed by the Tourist Project, salvage excavations were designed to test the different mounds, assess the site stratigraphy, and determine whether discrete activity areas could be identified. Three of the nine prominences proved to have been occupied in pre-Spanish times, spanning the Early to Late Polychrome periods (A.D. 300-1500). Ovens and/or hearths, and compressed lenses of shells and very coarse sherds were isolated, confirming intense (and, perhaps, exclusive) salt-boiling operations. Calvo and Bonilla are analyzing the pottery from the Salinas site. During the spring of 1979, Will 0. Finch (Beloit Col- lege) and Kim Honetschlager (Carleton College) sur- veyed Canfo Island off the southern Pacific coast. While the finding of obviously imported ceramic types from Panama and Guanacaste suggests that the island's geographical position made it an impor- tant trading settlement, the researchers concluded that Canio was firmly linked culturally to the adjacent coastal areas, having been occupied most intensively after A.D. 800. Winifred Creamer (Tulane Univer- sity) and Cathy Robison (Lawrence University) con- ducted surveys on the islands of the Gulf of Nicoya at the same time, while Creamer surveyed the periphery of the Gulf. In 1980 she excavated on San Lucas Island, and followed up in 1981 with a series of tests on Chira Island. The second site provided a large sample, and Creamer hopes to use these and 202</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH other data to arrive at an assessment of immediately pre-Conquest island adaptations. In May 1979, an exceptionally heavy, out-of-season rainstorm caused the Tempisque river to flood and expose the La Guinea site which was studied by Coe and Baudez in the 1960s. The locale was partially pil- laged before the Museum could get there, but salvage excavations recovered an impressive amount of in- formation. The site is mostly Middle Polychrome and has extensive habitation zones interspersed with cemeteries. Various features recovered included hardened sandy clay floors, cigar-shaped ovens or hearths, the foundation of an oval structure com- posed in part of preformed and fired adobe bricks, and sections of fired adobe with clear cane impres- sions. In addition, well preserved faunal remains were recovered. A number of artifacts (fishhooks, spear points, and net weights) bear testimony to a predominantly riverine subsistence orientation. Con- centrations of basalt and chert flakes would seem to indicate stoneworking activities, while pieces of ocher and unfired clay attest to local pottery manu- facture. A second flood in September 1979 destroyed the excavations, which were directed at different times by Silvia Salgado (MN), John Hoopes (Yale), and Edgar Allan Jenkins (UCLA). Julia Tavares (Yale) and Rebecca Gonzales (Tulane) also participated. For the last two years Jane Day (U of Colorado) has been studying a large collection of decorated burial ceramics from Hacienda Tempisque (Guanacaste), which date mostly to the Late Polychrome period (A.D. 1200-1530). Her analysis of design elements and decorative motifs suggests that a mutually under- standable iconography seen in imports and copies of trade pieces linked the Tempisque Valley very closely to the Rivas and "lakes" areas of Nicaragua in Late Polychrome times. The initial stylistic analysis has received tentative support from Ronald Bishop's neutron activation of control sets of sherds from Nicaragua and the Tempisque Valley (Brookhaven Laboratory, in collaboration with the Boston Museum of Fine Arts). It is interesting that, while trace mineral analysis of Late Polychrome sherds confirms Day's assessment of geographical differences in style, neutron activation studies of the earlier Middle Polychromes would seem to suggest geographical homogeneity for many of the ceramic types and varieties. In 1979 Lynette Norr (U Illinois) returned for a sec- ond season of fieldwork in the Rio Naranjo area where she conducted site surveys and recorded data from a number of petroglyph sites. She was assisted for part of the season by Wendy Hasselle (Memphis). Fifty-two burial mounds and surface scatters were mapped and collected, and test excavations were conducted at the Cabezas and Ramirez sites. The survey, excavations, and preliminary analysis confirmed the impression of the 1978 fieldwork, that the valley of the Naranjo was first occupied by at least 300 B.C. and abandoned by A.D. 800. The presence of manos and metates suggested to Norr that maize was an important dietary constituent of the valley from Zoned Bichrome times on, and prompt- ed her to embark upon a program of dietary analysis by reference to stable carbon isotope proportions in human bone. This ongoing study will include, in 1981, an analysis of human, mammal, and fish bone from inland and coastal, Preceramic, Early Ceramic, and Late Ceramic sites in the vicinity of Parita Bay (see Panama section), with a view to assessing the effects on local diet of marine resources, C-4 plants (like maize) and (by reference to the 15N/14N proportions) legumes. The final Guanacaste report comes from Laura Laurencich Minelli (Istituto di Antropologia dell'Uni- versita di Bologna, Italia) who directed excavations in 1979 in the Caverna Nicoa (Plain of Barra Honda, Nicoya) where work had begun in 1975. The second season revealed a number of new facts: (1) the cave contained at one time a cenote which had been used for primary and secondary "burials" from Zoned Bi- chrome to Early or Middle Polychrome times; (2) a new determination of 70 B.C. + 70 (sample C 222, Istituto de Ricerche Geotermiche, Pisa) was ac- quired, apparently for Zoned Bichrome ceramics; (3) a secondary burial found in a niche in the cave was accompanied only by shell and mother-of-pearl adornments (a possible preceramic date will be con- firmed or rejected by radiocarbon analysis of the carbonized bones by the laboratory at Riverside). In the Central Highlands the salvage excavations at Barrial de Heredia continued until March 1979, by which time the construction company could wait no longer and bulldozed many unexcavated features. (Credit should be given them, however, for allowing Museo Nacional crews to work for 10 months at the site.) Eight structural foundations marking the Curri- dabat-Cartago phase transition (A.D. 900-1100) were mapped. Four square or rectangular founda- tions contained at least one burial accompanied by several polychrome trade vessels from Guanacaste, while three elliptical foundations had extensive mid- dens and hearths but did not contain burials with trade vessels. Snarskis suggests that the shapes of the features reflect different uses: the squarish elements may have been domiciles, and the elliptical ones, domestic activity areas. A charcoal sample taken inside one of the square foundations yielded a date of A.D. 950 ? 60 (UCLA 2175-H). The Barrial de Heredia salvage operations recovered large quantities of carbonized plant re- mains from hearths and middens in and around the house foundations, and in two bottle-shaped pits, which belong to the deeper Pavas phase at the site (?200 B.C.-A.D. 400). Associated with the Cur- ridabat phase houses, a species of bean and at least two varieties of maize have been identified (by Walton Galinat, U of Massachusetts): Pollo, and Slender Pop. The former was at one time considered to be a race of South American origin which spread into Central America, but is now thought to have diverged from a primitive stock among the Nal-Tel, and to have undergone morphological changes which permitted its adaptation to humid, highland areas in general. Slender Pop is related to the more primitive popcorns like Confite Morocho and C. Puntiagudo from Perfu, and Pira from Columbia. The evidence from Barrial indicates that the inhabitants of the 203</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Costa Rican highlands around A.D. 1000 were inten- tionally maintaining specialized races of maize. During the last two months of the 1979 work at Barrial, sewer pipe trenches exposed two bottle- shaped pits of the Pavas phase component. One of them, cut almost in half, was, in Snarskis' own words, "chock-full of carbonized" floral remains, in- cluding beans and maize. Identifications are pending. Snarskis believes that these bell-shaped pits are not tombs, as Carlos Aguilar suggested to him, but storage pits like those described from many Pre- classic Mesoamerican sites. There were no traces of human bones in them, nor were any complete ceramic vessels recovered. Further, the horizontal distribution of the features coincides with fragmen- tary fired adobe floors which may form part of Pavas-phase houses. The ceramics recovered at the Barrial de Heredia site are being analyzed by Aida Blanco (MN), who directed the salvage operations, while Carlos Vall- depera (Ministerio de Cultura, Juventud y Deportes) is writing up the stone artifacts, by reference to macroscopic analyses of morphology and function, and microscopic edge-wear studies. At the La Fabrica site (A 10 LF), in the Central Highlands near Grecia, Juan Vicente Guerrero M. (MN) continued the salvage operations at the Na- tional Liquor Factory which had got under way in 1978. He was assisted in 1979 by David Herren (Grin- nel College). A number of circular habitation and mortuary features were defined. Part of the site may be coeval with the Tibas site (excavated by Snarskis) at which the now-famous Olmecoid jade was found. One of the tombs excavated by Guerrero had three lined-up metates underneath the occupant of the tomb, as well as mace heads and associated jade, suggesting that there was a widespread 6elite burial pattern throughout much of Costa Rica between A.D. 1 and 400. In 1980, Guerrero concentrated on sal- vaging materials belonging to the A.D. 400-900 com- ponent, to which belong at least 13 circular struc- tures, a stone walkway (calzada), and other features consisting of sherd concentrations, piles of cobbles and fired adobe floors. He hopes to present a dia- chronic and synchronic study of internal settlement patterns, as well as an analysis of the associated ar- tifacts. In May 1980, the Museo Nacional was informed of the discovery of an archaeological site at Ochomogo, a pass on the road between Tres Rios and Cartago. The site (C39-EC) is a Cartago phase (A.D. 1000-1500) cemetery possessing typical "stone-cist" tombs. The astounding number of 165 tombs covering an area of about 500 square miles was excavated by the field director, Aida M. Blanco Vargas (MN). Each unit consisted of a perfectly defined "cist" made out of cobblestones and/or upright andesite flagstones: some zones had 2 or 3 vertical levels of tombs. All the tombs were arranged in an east-west direction, being widest at the west where the majority of the skulls were found. Bone preservation was customarily very poor, but at least 25 individuals have been identified on the basis of the teeth, including children and adults. It is possible that both primary and secondary burials are present. Downslope from the burial ground, there is a semicircular line of stones which may have been a boundary or retaining wall similar to that reported by Hartman (in 1901) from Quircot de Cartago. The analysis of the materials is proceed- ing at the Museo Nacional, and it is hoped that research into ethnography and ethnohistory will clarify the demographic unit that is represented by the cemetery (clan, lineage, village, etc.). On the Atlantic slope, work carried on at the Severo Ledesma site, located near Guacimo in the eastern lowlands. The 1979 field season focused on the recovery of El Bosque phase (A.D. 1-500) house plans and was led by Carlos Enrique Herra (MN) and Robert Markens (Columbia U), assisted by Vic Brakke (UCLA) and Ann Peters (Yale). The two 12 x 4 m rec- tangular structures which were uncovered seem to be houses. Each had two hollowed-out cobbles near the center of one side, which probably served as mor- tars or offertory receptacles. A section of an El Bosque phase cemetery was also located. The typical corridor-shaped tombs, measuring 1.5 by 2.6 m, are similar in proportion to the houses. Arranged in neat ranks and files within a larger block, they contained grave goods which ranged from utilitarian (pots, manos, and metates), to the ceremonial (ocarinas, nasal snuffers, stamps, and jade pendants). Two carbon samples recovered in 1978 within a 30 x 15 m structure (which Snarskis now thinks to be two smaller houses sharing a common, stone-filled "patio"), gave determinations of 50 B.C. + 90 (UCLA 2175-D) and A.D. 350 + 60 (UCLA 2175-C). Both dates are associated with El Bosque ceramics. (The significant age difference between them could reflect patches of earth and carbon in one of the 1979 struc- tures, which might represent a second phase of ac- tivities-area editor's note.) Herra has been working up the materials from the 1973-1979 excavations, concentrating on establish- ing relationships between archaeological features and various social parameters (number of residents, domestic activities, work zones, and subsistence, etc.). In southeastern Costa Rica, Robert Drolet (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad) and Robert Markens spent a year (June 1980-1981) surveying the central portion of the Rio Grande de T6rraba (Diquis Valley). This represents the first somewhat underfinanced phase of what hopes to be a long-term, intensive study of Precolumbian settlement patterns over a 400 km2 area which will eventually be flooded by the Boruca Hydroelectric Project. About half of the 56 sites located by Drolet and Markens on their planned survey of three environ- mental zones (based on randomly selected 1 km2 quadrants over an area of 20 kmin2), can be related to the Aguas Buenas phase, dated from the end of the first millennium B.C. to about A.D. 600. The Aguas Buenas sites consist of small habitation-cum-ceme- tery locations dispersed exclusively within the upland 300-500 m zone. Three separate site clusters were found in the survey area, each representing 5 to 6 km2 of scattered occupation along flat hilltops close to small streams and secondary rivers. 204 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH At all these sites save one, the only recognizable in- ternal features were cemeteries (frequently badly looted). The exception was site P-90-BI, where numerous rectangular mounds and very dense areas of occupational d6bris suggest that this was a special location reminiscent of sites like Barriles and Sitio Pitti in western highland Chiriqui. Lithic and ceramic materials associated with the features indicate that P-90-BI may be contemporary with the later part of the Aguas Buenas sequence (i.e., the Bugaba Phase of Linares, dated to between A.D. 200 and 600). The sites that are found in the lower alluvial plains of the T6rraba valley date to the Chiriqui phase (?A.D. 800-1500), a fact which suggests that there was a rather drastic change in settlement patterns after the Aguas Buenas Phase. A survey conducted along a 17 km stretch of the valley pinpointed 3- to 4-km' sites located on alluvial fans. Hilltop cemeteries associated with the habitation zones ap- pear to be of two types, one having cobble-marked tombs arranged in lines, and the other containing ar- chitectural features, stone carvings and special of- ferings of ceramics. When the cemeteries are mapped, it appears that there were at least three population foci in the survey area. Drolet and Markens intensively surveyed one of the Chiriqui phase habitation sites-P-107-Mc (Mur- ci6elago)-and identified six residential sectors rang- ing in size from 5 to 7 ha and comprising cobblestone house floors 30 m in diameter, set in groups of two or three. Around the edges of the houses were refuse pits and other signs of domestic activity. Narrow causeways linked them to what appear to be cere- monial structures whose size and shape are different from those of the round house foundations. Prelim- inary analysis of the thousands of stone tools recovered on the surface (manos, metates, cores, scrapers, axes, hammerstones, etc.) suggests that the range of activities was similar in each of the houses of the residential sectors or barrios. Drolet and Markens suggest that maize-farming and woodwork- ing were very important activities at Murci6elago and conclude that the site's importance in the regional political network may well have been due to the benefits that accrued from exchanging surpluses of these materials. Increased financing has been promised by the I.C.E. for this important project which is under the general direction of Michael J. Snarskis (MN). The preliminary field data fit well with the developmental scheme proposed by Linares and Ranere for western Chiriqui: a burgeoning of maize-using villages in the piedmont zone some time in the first millennium B.C., colonization of the highlands as maize developed resistance to increasing humidity, and subsequent expansion to the coast and islands of the Pacific, perhaps as late as A.D. 200-600. Drolet and Markens may well be right in thinking that the Diquis valley played an important role in the origins and dispersal of the Aguas Buenas adaptive pattern. A research group has been evaluating new infor- mation about the presence and distribution of jade in southern Mesoamerica and lower Central America, especially Costa Rica. A conference was held at Dumbarton Oaks on December 2, 1980, to discuss the data that have been analyzed by the project. Ronald Bishop, Robert Coleman, David Friedel, Mark Graham, David Grove, Norman Hammond, Frederick Lange, James Garber, and Robert Sharer presented papers. Preliminary results suggest that the Motagua jade source was the only one used in Precolumbian times in Central America, and that it contains ex- tremely variable materials; however, a small group of artifacts has different characteristics from those of the Motagua source. These may reflect further variability in the Motagua materials or represent a completely different and as yet unknown jade source. PANAMA. In July and August 1979 a Temple University team conducted archaeological and geo- morphological research around Parita Bay. The ar- chaeological group, led by Anthony J. Ranere, includ- ed Steve Graff, Patricia Hansell, and Dolores Piper- no. Additional assistance was provided by Cathy Shelton Einhaus, Doris Weiland, Muriel Kirkpatrick, and Harry Hansell (Temple); Karen Stothert (Banco Central, Ecuador); Juan Jos6 Ortiz Aguilufi, Steve Gaber, Miguel Rodriguez, Andr6s Principe, and Bienvenido Castro (members of a Canal Area research group led by Ortiz Aguilu). Excavations were carried out at the Cerro Mangote shellmound, a preceramic site now situated about 10 km from the mouth of the Santa Maria River, where Charles McGimsey (Arkansas) had worked in the 1950s. The original plan of digging a small number of very carefully controlled test cuts with a view to extracting sediments for sieving through graded screens, was thwarted by the revela- tion that huaqueros had severely maimed the site (even though it had no pottery). Nevertheless, some pristine deposits were isolated, more burials located, and workable samples removed. Seven new radiocarbon determinations (two run on the inside and outside of the same shell) confirmed McGimsey's early fifth millennium B.C. date for the beginning of the deposit, and placed the end of the in- tensive occupation around 3000 B.C. (latest reliable date 3105 B.C. ? 155 (TEM-207). Preliminary analysis of the artifacts has confirmed the pre- ceramic nature of the deposit. As the earliest in situ date for Monagrillo type pottery in Parita Bay is 2850 B.C. ? 100 (TEM-119), at the Cueva de los Ladrones, Cocle, Cerro Mangote's abandonment as a living site would seem to mark the ceramic/preceramic boun- dary. A large faunal sample was recovered from Ranere's excavations. Preliminary analysis confirms the studies of the geomorphologists whose nearby drilling program indicates that Cerro Mangote was much nearer the active shoreline when it was first occupied (maybe as little as 1 km away). The 18 shell species identified by Patricia Hansell are all tidal mud-flat species. Cardisoma crabs, estuarine catfish, the White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and raccoon (Procyon) are by far the most common faunal species. Richard Cooke of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) will continue the faunal 205</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY analysis in 1981 with the aid of a Wenner-Gren grant. The Parita Bay geomorphological team was led by John Adams and aided by John Dere and John Barber (Temple). By using a Vibracore drilling rig they ob- tained core samples from a number of sites at the mouth of the Santa Maria river and in the southern part of the delta. Sediments are still being analyzed at Temple. A preliminary sequence of coastal events has been built up, however, establishing the follow- ing periods: (1) 10,000-8000 B.P.-rapid rise in sea level; (2) 8000-6500 B.P.-drastic decline in sea-level rate; (3) 6500-5000 B.P.-the coastline begins to pro- grade faster than the sea can rise; (4) 5000-3000 B.P.-transgression, as the sea again rises faster than the coast can advance; (5) 3000 B.P.-Present- the coast carries on prograding. It is hoped that in the future the geomorphological sequence will be very closely correlated with chang- ing site locations. Cores drilled in 1979 at the Mona- grillo site have indicated that the abandonment of the cultural deposit (last radiocarbon date 1295 B.C. ? 100 years (SI-2843) coincides well with the forma- tion of a mangrove swamp which was dated in the drill sediments to 950 B.C. ? 100 (TEM-149) (a mangrove swamp would have greatly reduced the productivity of the high-energy niches ideal for inten- sive Tivela clam collection). Dolores Piperno (Temple) is continuing her phyto- lith program. Having suggested that maize was being cultivated by about 1500 B.C. at the Aguadulce Shelter site she has continued extracting phytoliths from modern grasses in order to perfect her tech- niques. She is analyzing soils from the Sitio Sierra site (300 B.C.-A.D. 500) and the Cueva de los Ladrones (5000-?500 B.C.). At the former site there are large quantities of palm phytoliths, and to at- tempt to identify these beyond family level Piperno will be collecting modern materials in Panama for phytolith extraction and keying. In 1978 and 1979 Kathrine Shelton Einhaus (Tem- ple) conducted a survey and test excavations along the Chiriqui Viejo River. Her survey zone was divided into three ecological zones: (1) montane, (2) low hills, and (3) coastal plains. Sixty-two sites were located and test pits excavated at four of these. Analysis will concentrate on determining the spatial and chrono- logical differences between the Aguas Buenas and supposedly earlier "Scarified" or "Concepci6n" wares, and on assessing settlement pattern changes through time in the three survey zones. In April and May 1980 Richard G. Cooke (STRI) conducted a brief survey of the lower part of the Changuinola and Risc6 valleys of Bocas del Toro, where a large hydroelectric project is in the planning stage. Nine archaeological sites were identified. Materials recovered from the surface and small tests indicate that the area was occupied by agricultural communities that used Linares' Bocas Phase ceramics (A.D. 800 onwards). Some materials are similar to Bugaba phase pottery, dated to between A.D. 200 and 600. All the identified sites seemed to be single dwellings occupied over a relatively short period of time, or very sporadically. No extensive, deep, or obviously multicomponent deposits were en- countered, and no surface features were noted (with the exception of possible grave markers). It seems likely, then, that settlement patterns after the intro- duction of agriculture were similar to those of the present-day Ngawbere-speaking Guaymi (hamlets of three to six houses located on hills and spurs over- looking rivers, streams, or quebradas, and a high degree of mobility). Nevertheless, some of the sites had concentrations of stone tools, while a few types occurred only at certain localities, a fact which sug- gests that a carefully planned survey might well perceive intersite and intrasite patterns in artifact distributions up and down the valleys, notwithstand- ing the small size of the deposits. In 1980 the activities of the Patrimonio Historico (National Heritage Department of the National Insti- tute of Culture) were concentrated in Herrera pro- vince and the Canal Area. The return of Juan Yangiiez and Luis Almanza to Panama meant that the department could use the services of trained Pana- manian archaeologists for the first time in several years. In the dry season of 1980, Carlos Thomas Winter (Universidad de Chile) conducted a survey of the en- tire La Villa river valley, aided by Ernesto Barillas (under contract to the Patrimonio Hist6rico). Over 50 archaeological sites were located dating to the Cen- tral Region Period IV (300 B.C.-A.D. 500) and later. A follow-up season is projected. At the same time, Luis Almanza (under contract to the Patrimonio Hist6rico) excavated a shellmound near Palo Seco in the old Canal Zone. This site, known as Engineer's Hill, had been located by a survey team directed by Juan Jos6 Ortiz Aguilu (Tem- ple) between July and August 1979 on behalf of the Patrimonio Hist6rico. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, it contains about 100,000 m2 of extremely concen- trated cultural remains. Three separate stratigraph- ic layers were isolated. The first two layers may have been disturbed by bulldozers (they contain a lot of Colonial materials, however, and the locale could have been used after the Conquest for activities related to lime production-area Editor's comment). The third and lowest layer is intact and contains ceramics very similar to those described by the Stirl- ings from Taboga and Taboguilla in Panama Bay. Juan Yangiiez (Universidad de Panama/Centro de Restauraci6n de la O.E.A., Panama) is in charge of the analysis of the materials. At the other end of the Canal Area, on the Carib- bean, a Patrimonio Hist6rico team headed by Sebastian Paniza has been cleaning and making plans of the historic Fort San Lorenzo, at the en- trance to the Chagres River, as a prelude to the restoration of the site under the auspices and tech- nical advice of UNESCO. Arsenio Gonzfilez and Luis Caicedo (archaeological technicians) have been dig- ging at the site to locate original floors and architec- tural elements. Another historical area which has received the at- tention of archaeologists is the Old Quarter or "Casco Antiguo" of present-day Panama City (found- ed in 1673). From May 1979 to November 1980, 206 [Vol. 47, No. 1, 19821</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH Richard G. Cooke (STRI) was under contract to a private construction company (Fiduciaria Ad- ministrativa, S.A.) to direct salvage excavations at the Dominican Convent and the Church of the Com- pany of Jesus. The excavations were part of a large restoration project funded by the Banco Interameri- cano de Desarrollo (International Development Bank), and administered by the Panamanian Institute of Tourism and the Presidencia de Panama. Beatriz Rovira de Pacheco (Universidad de la Plata, Argen- tina/U de Panama) was both field assistant and laboratory aide, while Tomas Gonzalez Ruiz (U Santa Maria la Antigua, Panama) participated full-time on the project. At the Dominican Convent virtually the entire floor area of the Church, patio and pasillos, and adjacent living-quarters was stripped off to the Colonial levels (1678-1821), and several original features were ex- posed (flagstone floors, a cobblestone patio, wells, rubbish pits, etc.) Features belonging to later periods were cleaned and recorded; some were removed or covered by the restoration project's architects. Rovira de Pacheco and Ariela Dayan (Tulane) have been researching Colonial and 19th-century docu- ments, particularly newspapers, and have been able to relate various architectural elements to specific historical activities. This work has been financed by an Exxon Fellowship to Rovira de Pacheco. Analysis of the materials will continue through 1982. POSTSCRIPT: ADVANCED SEMINAR ON LOWER CENTRAL AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY. Between April 8 and 14, 1980, 10 archaeologists met at the School of American Research, Santa Fe, to discuss the archaeology of Lower Central America. Gordon Willey (Harvard), Frederick Lange (Illinois State U), and Doris Stone (Harvard, Tulane) formed the plan- ning committee. The other participants were: Richard G. Cooke (Smithsonian Tropical Research In- stitute, Panama), Wolfgang Haberland (Museum fur Volkerkunde und Vorgeschichte, Hamburg), Paul Healy (Trent, Canada), Allison Paulsen (Hartwick), Robert Sharer (University Museum, Philadelphia), Payson Sheets (Colorado), and Michael Snarskis (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica). Warwick Bray was asked to add an additional paper for the proposed volume, which will be dedicated to the memory of Samuel K. Lothrop, a pioneer of Lower Central American Research. Many aspects of chronology, regional develop- ment, exchange, and social organization were dis- cussed and a consensus emerged which generally re- jected certain hypotheses of the past: (1) while there were contacts and exchanges between the different regions of Lower Central America and the nuclear areas to the south and north, cultural development on the Isthmus was not totally dependent upon external influences; (2) the area was not dominated politically to any significant degree by outside forces; (3) Lower Central America represents a frequently unique adaptation zone with its own characteristics and idiosyncracies, and was not just a refuge for un- wanted migrants from south or north. Richard G. Cooke AMAZON BASIN AND EASTERN BRAZIL PERU. Thomas Myers (University of Nebraska State Museum) conducted a brief survey of archaeo- logical resources at Achual Tipischa, a Cocamilla village between Yurimaguas and Lagunas, on the lower Huallaga river. Three sites were identified, probably dating from the late prehistoric to early historic periods. Two were located on the floodplain, one on the levee at the edge of the floodplain. The levee site produced a Napo-Caimito polychrome type bowl, while the floodplain sites yielded pottery that may relate to a somewhat earlier time period. No written report was received from Rogger Ravines (Instituto Nacional de La Cultura), but the Revista del Museo Nacional of Lima, Peru, Vol. 44, reports on work carried out in April 1980 on the Rio Corrientes pertaining to the late prehistoric peoples who lived in the area. Only distant relationships to the well described late prehistoric ceramic (poly- chrome) traditions of the main river, Cumancaya and Caimito, can be recognized. The material probably represents a localized tradition, perhaps antecedent to the Jivaro who occupied the Rio Corrientes in historic times. BOLIVIA. Bernardo Dougherty (Universidad Na- cional de La Plata "UNLP") reported on continuing research in the Llanos de Mojos, Beni Department. The project is part of the Amazonian Ecosystem Research Program sponsored by the Smithsonian In- stitution with the general coordination of Betty J. Meggers and the late Clifford Evans. The project began in 1977 with the cooperation of the Smith- sonian Institution, the Instituto Nacional de Ar- queologia de La Paz, the Universidad Nacional y Museo de La Plata, and the Universidad Jos6 Balli- vian de Beni. The University of Cochabamba sent one student for the first year. The project is directed by Bernardo Dougherty. Other staff members are Horacio Calandra, Cristina Rolleri de Dougherty, Jorge Kraydeberg, and Hector Diaz. In the 1979 field season about a dozen sites were found and surface collected, and some test excavations were made. Preliminary classification of cultural materials was made with the advice and cooperation of Clifford Evans and Betty J. Meggers. A series of charcoal samples have been submitted to the Smithsonian In- stitution. Members of the research team are con- vinced that the habitational mounds are largely natural and at most may have been modestly re- modeled by those who inhabited them. Stratigraphic cuts into the mounds indicate that they were initially riverine ridges that were later raised through depo- sition of garbage and some piling up of dirt and natural deposition of sediments brought by nearby streams. Preliminary seriation studies indicate a number of phases may exist, perhaps partially over- lapping. It is hoped that the differential use of crushed sherd, cauxi and shell temper, and incised and punctate designs on pottery may eventually in- dicate geographical or chronological differences among the groups that inhabited the area. Treatment of the dead differs from one site to the other. So far 207</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the following varieties have been recognized, although these cannot be separated stratigraphical- ly: (1) primary, extended adult burials with offerings including pottery, bone needles, etc.; (2) primary, flexed adult burials with no grave goods; (3) adult urn burials; (4) a single isolated human skull covered with a large platter. URUGUAY. Silvia Maranca (Museu Paulista, Universidade de Sao Paulo) continued her study of ceramic material collected during salvage work at Salto Grande. Her work has been financed by UNESCO and the government of Uruguay. BRAZIL. Piaui. The French-Brazilian project coordinated by Niede Guidon (tcole de Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales de Paris) completed survey, mapping, and ethnobotanical research of the prehistoric cultures of the southeast portion of Piaui. Special emphasis was given the pictographs of the area. More than 200 rock shelters with pictographs have been mapped, and a series of new dates has permitted classification of the prehistoric art of the region. Several new dates were obtained in the beginning of 1980 for some of the pictographs. A date of 11,950 ? 300 B.C. (Gif. 4927) was obtained at Toca do Sitio, while a block with painting from the next level is believed to date to about 12,000 B.C. Cultural materials were found to a depth 60 cm below the level dated to 12,000; carbon from the basal level will soon be dated. As anticipated, early dates were found in other cave sites of the region. Level 13 of the Toca do Bojo site was dated to 5230 ? 90 B.C. (Gif. 4926), and level 14 of the same site was dated to 6130 ? 70 B.C. (Gif. 4928). A date of 5690 ? 140 B.C. (Gif. 4928) was obtained for the Toca do Banqueirao da Pedra Furada site where skillfully ex- ecuted paintings using up to 5 colors have been found. At Toca do Banqueirao da Pedra Furada 50 cm below a level dated at 6100 B.C. (Gif. 4625), a piece of painted stone from the wall of the cave was used in the border of a hearth. It was possible to confirm the hypothesis that cer- tain geometric figures not found in the Varzea Grande Style are the result of recent intrusions into the area. These are found only in certain caves dating to about 900 B.C. in which corrugated pottery occurs in the top levels. In the Toca do Perna shelter pictures in the Varzea Grande style are characterized by a great number of miniature figures forming elaborate scenes. Here test excavations revealed the existence of a long stratigraphic sequence with rich faunal remains, preserved wood, and a stone industry of silica, chalcedony, and quartzite. The tools of silica are of a type that suggests an age of about 8,000 years. Petroglyphs from 28 newly discovered rock shelters have been analyzed. The Northeast Tradi- tion and the Varzea Grande Style have been defined, as has the relationship between the previously de- scribed Northwest, Geometric, Itacoatiaras, and Central Traditions. During the 1980 season of exca- vations a new procedure of using movie film was tested, in hopes of allowing better review of the ex- cavated levels. Minas Gerais. Ondemar Dias Jor. (Instituto de Ar- queologia Brasileira) reported on research carried out in 1980. Work was concentrated in the cave sites discovered during the first part of the Sao Francisco valley project begun in 1970. The new program has been approved by the Secretaria do Patrim6nio Hist6rico and Artistico Nacional and is supported by the Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico Tecnol6gico, and the Latin American Archaeological Fund of the Smithsonian Institution and is to continue for 5 years. In the course of the year the Lapa de Foice site (MG-RP-8) was excavated. This site, located on the Canabrava River, a tributary to the Rio Preto, in a transitional zone between the thorny forest and the jungle, is easily accessible, and con- sists of three large connected chambers. One of these was completely filled with cultural deposits. Excava- tions were carried out in the two lesser filled rooms. A series of pictographs found on the cave walls, in- cluding small naturalistic and abstract figures, have been copied and photographed. Two trenches were cut through the chamber at right angles to a max- imum depth of 230 cm, revealing a thick bed of relatively recent material overlying more ancient layers. At the edges of the chamber the original rock floor was less than 70 cm below the surface. Arti- facts of the upper component consisted of stone tools, pottery of the Unai phase, flexed burials and hearths containing remains of mollusks of the genus Thaumastus. The more ancient lower levels con- tained little evidence of food remains, but some burnt remains of bone indicated hunting activities. Fossil- ized human bones were found, but the only artifacts were elongated plano-convex blades of jasper and silica. Comparisons with materials found by Pedro Ig- nacio Schmitz (Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisaa) in- dicates the early material may be 8,000 years old. Carbon obtained from the site has been submitted to the Smithsonian Institution for processing. Data ob- tained in these excavations generally complements previous work from the Gruta do Gentio in the same area and increases the understanding of the archaic occupation of the region. Research was directed by Ondemar Dias and Eliana Carvalho with the col- laboration of Paulo Seda and the participation of the Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira. S-ao Paulo. Dorath P. Uchoa reported on a number of projects being carried out by the Univer- sidad de Sao Paulo (USP) Instituto de Pr6-hist6ria. One of the studies involves the use of the abundant skeletal remains excavated from the sambaquis of Sao Paulo. Paleopathological studies of this popula- tion are being undertaken, including work on dental wear as well as electromicroscopy of cellular struc- ture of skeletal remains. Researchers include Mario de Francisco (Instituto de Ciencias Biom6dicas de Sao Paulo), M. C. de Mello E. Alvim (Museo Nacional da Universidade do Rio de Janeiro) and Dorath P. Uchba (USP). Uch6a is also continuing to better understand and organize the chronology and culture history of the sambaqui cultures of the coast of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Santa Catarina. Maria Jos6 Reis (USP) completed 208 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH her dissertation, A Problem6tic Arqueol6gica Das Estruturas Subterr6neas No Planalto Catarinense. The study of subterranean structures in the state of Santa Catarina utilizes a sample of 104 sites. Rela- tionships of shape, size, depth, associated artifacts, and geographical features were all studied. The ma- jority of structures are thought to have been human occupations of hunters and collectors of pine nuts who may have supplemented their diet by gardening. Ronald L. Weber VENEZUELA. During the period between January 1978 and December 1980, Jos6 M. Cruxent (Museo del Hombre), Adrian Hernandez Bafio, Fran- cisco E. Duran, and Nelson J. Matheus (Museo de Ceramica, Hist6rica y Loza Criolla) collected over 5,000 complete vessels belonging to modern tradi- tional potters from Western Venezuela, along with ethnographic data on methods of manufacture, stylistic norms, formal variation, and folktales associated with ceramics, in order to study creolle ceramic styles of Falc6n. From 1979 until the present, paleontologist Jean Bocquentin Villaneuva (Museo del Hombre) has been finishing the taxonomic classification of the Late Pleistocene megafauna associated with paleo-Indian materials from the sites of Muaco, Taima-Taima, and Tara-Tara. Substantial revisions of the number of in- dividuals per species present at the sites have been made, in contrast to preliminary reports by J. M. Cruxent, Casimiquiela, Ochsenius, Alan Bryan, and others. Late Pleistocene sites of the Urumaco Depres- sion were also classified. The megafaunal associa- tion with El Jobo points (14,000 to 16,000 B.C.) will prove to be of great interest to Early Man studies. Potential paleo-Indian sites in the Peninsula of Para- guana (Falc6n State) have been discovered by J. M. Cruxent and are to be investigated in 1981. The mastodon burial site of Quebrada Ocando will be in- vestigated by Bocquentin and Cruxent. Jos6 R. Oliver (Museo del Hombre; University of Il- linois-Urbana) will coordinate an intensive archaeo- logical site survey of the State of Falc6n, focusing on the Dabajuroid Series, with subsequent excavation of selected sites. The researchers expect to form hypotheses and models concerning the origins and migratory patterns of the Dabajuroid complexes, in relation to settlement patterns and economic (sub- sistence) modes. The immediate goal is the precise placement of Dabajuroid, both synchronically and diachronically. Jos6 R. Oliver (Special Correspondent) ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA ECUADOR. Institutional development and finan- cial support for archaeology continue in Ecuador. The Guangala Archaeological Project, directed by Karen Stothert (U of Texas "UT"-San Antonio), in- augurated a new permanent field station in Cautivo, built by the Anthropological Museum of the Central Bank. Stothert's work focuses on the settlement, sub- sistence, and exchange patterns of the Guangala peo- ple who inhabited the Santa Elena Peninsula in the Regional Development period. The first season saw the identification of 115 sites, mostly Guangala, in her survey of the Rio Tambo/Rio Grande drainage. In the town of Valdivia a deep, stratified Engoroy (Chor- rera) and Early Guangala midden was excavated. Helaine Silverman (UT), who has undertaken the ceramic analysis, reports that Guangala pottery is more varied than previously thought, but that close affinity and continuity between Guangala and Engoroy styles are confirmed. Eugene McDougle directed the excavation of a large earthern structure (albarrada) used until recently as a water catchment basin. This impoundment was in use, with its ar- tificial banks occupied by houses, as early as the Engoroy period. Stothert is also collecting informa- tion on the traditional water management strategies of the local people, to clarify problems of human adaptation to the environment, whether or not there has been significant climate change. Karen Olsen Bruhns (San Francisco State U) and Norman Hammond (Rutgers U) have begun work in the Paute Valley of the southern highlands, known to have been an important route of exchange between the Amazonian lowlands, the interior highland valleys, and the coast. The project is concerned with utilization of this route and its role in local economy, settlement, and politics. A test in the Late Formative site of Pirincay, near the town of Paute, yielded a Chorrera chert point associated with camelid bones and Early Narrio-related pottery. Material from clandestine excavations also indicates considerable interaction with Peru from the Middle Horizon on- wards, with trade in ceramics continuing through the early colonial period. The Central Bank has opened a colonial and ar- chaeological museum in Cuenca under the director- ship of Rene Cardoso. To augment the well-known collections of Padre Crespi, Jaime Iorovo has begun a large program of survey and salvage archaeology in the valley of Cuenca, while the remaining portions of the ruins of Inca Tomebamba have been purchased by the Central Bank and are under excavation by Ernesto Salazar. Jon Damp (U of Calgary) reports that the 1980 Ex- cavations at Loma Alta, in the upper Valdivia Valley, produced more Early Valdivia houses similar to those at Real Alto. Associated features include burials, hearths, food preparation areas, including carbon- ized seeds, lithic workshops, refuse pits, and prob- able cotton spinning areas. One house contained a clearly demarcated area of discolored soil, seemingly a decomposed sleeping mat. The hearth from this house gave a date of 2680 ? 160 B.C. (GX-7699), thought to mark the Valdivia I to II transition. Houses are arranged in a U-shape in the Early Valdivia village. An extensive, Late Formative, Chorrera oc- cupation was also identified. One of the burials ex- cavated was accompanied by a shaman's ritual para- phernalia: bone snuffing tube, bone spatula, and gourd-shaped lime residue, along with other symbols of drug use, rank, or ritual. 209</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Deborah Pearsall (U of Missouri) continues her re- search on phytoliths and ethnobotany in collabora- tion with several of the researchers affiliated with the Central Bank. An interior aspect of the Jambeli Culture (El Oro Province) has been identified by Jef- frey Quilter (Ripon College). He wishes to reevaluate its role in Ecuadorean-Peruvian relationships, during the Regional Development Period, suggesting that, while the coast may have been relatively isolated at times, north-south relations were fairly constant in the highlands. Collections made by Patricia Netherly (U of Massa- chusetts) in the Arenillas Valley are now being analyzed. In another aspect of the Tahuin Project, sponsored by the Central Bank, Elizabeth Carter (In- stitute of Archaeology) worked at the Guarumal shell mound near the mouth of the Jubones River. The Museum of the Central Bank in Guayaquil, directed by Olaf Holm, has overall responsibility for the work to be conducted in 1982. NORTHERN PERU. The North Peruvian Anthro- pological Research Group, founded to promote great- er cooperation and coordination among scholars working in that area, has changed its name to the An- dean Anthropological Research Group. Its news- letter, Willay, distributed by Izumi and Melody Shi- mada (Princeton U), details the work of geologists, ethnobotanists, archaeozoologists, and ethnohistori- ans, as well as archaeologists. The group has five aims: (1) rapid dispersal and informal exchange of data and ideas; (2) promotion of standardized data collection and systematics; (3) establishment of regional centers with libraries, floral, faunal, and ceramic type collections, and short-term storage and housing for visiting researchers; (4) pooling and rent- ing of equipment, furniture, and housing; and (5) greater collaboration between Andean and foreign scholars. Students seeking field opportunities are in- vited to list themselves with the Shimadas, who will try to match their experience and interests with those conducting research. Last season Izumi Shimada, director of the Batan Grande-La Leche project, uncovered the principal pyramid of Huaca Corte, a T-shaped structure known for its cemetery of large tombs with gold funerary ob- jects. Excavation revealed complex architecture atop the pyramid, including square, painted columns and painted walls. Concurrently, James Vreeland (UT) ex- amined burial and looting patterns, locating Classic Lambayeque murals (about A.D. 950) in the ceme- tery. He estimates that during this time some 750,000 burials were made, constituting the largest single mortuary precinct in the New World. Consequently, the Batan Grande sites have increasingly attracted more sophisticated looters. Continuing excavation by Shimada at Huaca Lucia (Cupisnique) showed that a U-shaped compound with gigantic painted columns was built on a two-tiered platform. A monumental stairway, in excellent condition due to its ritual burial with sand and clay seals, provided access from the north. Melody Shimada obtained organic materials at contiguous Huaca Cholupe to comple- ment her earlier analysis of materials from Huacaloma near Cajamarca. Together, the Huacas Lucia and Cholupe form one of the largest Cupisnique complexes north of the Moche Valley. Study of the mining and metallurgical center of Cerro de los Cementerios by Alan Craig (Florida Atlantic U) and Steve Epstein (U of Pennsylvania) shows an advanced prill extraction technique for copper previously unknown in America and of a sophistication unmatched by comparable Old World prill industries. Well-built smelters that could with- stand repeated use (as shown experimentally) and much crushed slag suggest that the site may have been a major producer of standardized copper and copper alloy ingots. Ceramics from Los Cementerios and nearby Cerro Blanco suggest that operations spanned the Middle and Late Horizons. Working on the ground and from aerial photographs, Craig also mapped the Raca Rumi and Apurle intervalley canal systems. Christine Pickett (U of Oregon) Carlos Elera (U of San Marcos), and Patricia San Martin (U of Trujillo) continued their work on Middle Horizon ceramics. Along with radiocarbon dates from Huaca del Pueblo, pottery analysis shows that genesis of Lam- bayeque style must be sought within Moche V cultural contexts and Moche-Wari syncretism in the early Middle Horizon, about A.D. 700 to 800, becom- ing formalized by A.D. 900 in the Classic Lambaye- que with its tradition of monumental architecture and elaborate burials. In collaboration with the Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa, Chris Donnan (Museum of Cultural History, Los Angeles) began work on Chotuna and Chornancap, just west of Lambayeque. Chotuna may be Chot, where Naymlap (a Precolum- bian lord) built his palace, while Chornancap might be the palace that Naymlap built nearby for his prin- cipal wife. Working mostly from colonial manuscripts, Susan Ramirez-Horton (Ohio U) is reconstructing economic patterns on the eve of the Spanish conquest on the north coast, between Pacasmayo and Motupe. Under investigation are (1) the territorial jurisdictions of local lords, with emphasis on mitimaes living apart from the main ethnic groups; (2) natural resources controlled by each ethnic group; (3) land tenure and labor specialization; and (4) exchange between coastal groups and between these and their highland counterparts. She is especially interested in deter- mining whether, aside from mechanisms of reciproci- ty and redistribution, there were specialized traders or merchants acting as individuals. Phyllis Martin (Columbia U) has returned from nearly 1 year's work at Gallito Ciego, at the neck of the Jequetepeque Valley, soon to be destroyed by the Zana-Jequetepeque irrigation project. Following mapping and systematic surface collection, excava- tions revealed several kinds of specialized architec- ture, including domestic and food processing areas, possible elite residences, and structures with public, ceremonial, and/or administrative functions. Parts of Gallito Ciego were used from the Early Horizon through the Late Intermediate period, but it may have been most important as an administrative out- 210 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH post of the Chimu state. The public sector contained a well preserved Chimu frieze, much like those at Chan-Chan, consisting of high-relief adobe figures set in niches on the front of a small structure. On the Pampa de Mojucape of the Jequetepeque Valley, Herb Eling (UT) has identified remnants of Moche fields, furrows, and canals fortuitously preserved as small monadnocks elevated 3 or 4 meters above the present valley floor. Severe downcutting and erosion, beginning in late Moche times, removed most of the former surface, except where sand dunes have covered and protected parts of the agricultural fields and sites. These are sporadically uncovered by the wind, only to be covered over again by the moving sand. Both the scarcity of remnants on the monadnocks and the fleeting appearance of the fields and sites suggest that settlement pattern studies may be seriously biased in other valleys where similar erosion and wind action are important. Michael West continues his analyses of nutrition, growth, and social structure in the Viru Valley. In 1980 human bones from a cemetery immediately behind the beach were sampled and compared with those from a nearby contemporary population. West believes that each burial ground was used by a distinct social component of an Early Intermediate population living in the lower valley. Both com- ponents suffered vitamin C deficiency, but one group appears to have been taller and better nourished. Further, West proposes that the less well-nourished group practiced selective female neglect in response to chronic food shortages. West also intends to con- duct carbon isotope fractionation studies to learn the effect of diet (maize, nonmaize plants, sea foods) on upper and lower valley populations. Richard Schaedel (UT) spent much of the 1980-81 year at the Hamburg Ethnological Museum, where he worked with the Bruning field notes, ethnohistoric transcriptions, and photographs. One of his tasks was the compilation of a Yunga (Muchik) dictionary, coordinating the vocabularies of Bastian, Bruning, Carrera, Middendorf, and Zevallos. Schaedel is also working on a synthesis and reconciliation of north coast iconography, as represented in the divergent interpretations of Hocquenghem, von Schuler- Schomig, and Berezking. NORTH CENTRAL PERU. Robert Bird (Institute for the Study of Plants, Food, and Man) reports a rather discouraging analysis of early maize, mostly from the north central coast. Archaeologically recovered corn is still of limited usefulness due to the effects of site component mixture and intrusion through human, animal, and physical processes. If the suggested age (older than 3,000 years) of several of the samples studied (from Aspero and Los Gavilanes) were accepted; botanically preferred models of the evolution of low row number, high cupule width, and other features would necessarily be altered. The preceramic presence of some traits would demand evolutionary events to have occurred before 2000 B.C., that by other measures should only have taken place in the last 1,500 years. David Wilson (U of Michigan) has finished his am- bitious survey of the entire Santa Valley below Chu- quicara, as well as parts of the Chao, the lower Quebrada de Lacramarca, and adjacent desert coastline. The distribution of 1,263 sites, plotted on 1:15,000 scale aerial photographs of the S.A.N., sug- gests gradual cultural development until the rise of state society by the end of the Early Intermediate period. Population declined in the latter part of the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate period, with a resurgence in numbers and cultural complexity dur- ing the Late Horizon. Among the more notable re- mains studied were (1) 20 of the Shippee-Johnson "fortresses" on the southern desert margin, mapped and tentatively assigned to the Early Horizon; (2) the Great Wall system along the northern edge of the valley, which probably dates to the early Middle Horizon; (3) figures traced in the desert pavement, in the form of llamas, birds, humans, and abstract figures; and (4) some 200 km of the Middle Horizon road system between the Santa and Chao. In addi- tion, Wilson mapped over 200 sites and architectural complexes at large scale. Above Chuquicara, on the banks of the Tablachaca tributary, Terence Grieder (UT) and Alberto Bueno (Museo de Pachacamac) have nearly finished their investigation of the La Galgada ceremonial complex. Excavations over the past 3 years indicate that, for the last 1,000 years of the preceramic period, small, round, kiva-like chambers with central firepits, benches, and wall niches were the basic ceremonial form. About the time pottery first appeared, these were consolidated into a single, larger, rectangular chamber, much like at Kotosh. Eventually, the U-shaped plan with rectangular rooms was adopted. Aside from a lesson in the evolution of ceremonial ar- chitecture, La Galgada yielded unexpectedly rich preceramic burial goods and abundant remains of food and fiber plants. As some of the remains have been identified as Old World cultigens there is a possibility of intrusion or disturbance. During the 1980 season Richard Daggett (U of Mas- sachusetts) surveyed the area around and below Jimbe, where most sites have Early Horizon com- ponents, marked by circle and dot pottery motifs, ceramic pan pipes, neckless ollas, and ground slate knives. House mounds were often reoccupied in the Middle Horizon, and sometimes by peoples using Recuay and Chimu vessels. Contrary to earlier reports, Daggett has now located a number of Early Horizon sites in the lower and middle Nepefia. He suspects that the settlement pattern extended the full length of the valley, with lateral pockets of early set- tlement in various quebradas. Early Horizon sites are scarce above Jimbe (1,550 m). Weather permitting, the survey will be extended up the Colcap drainage to test Daggett's thesis of a break between coastal and highland settlement systems. Thomas and Shelia Pozorski (Carnegie Museum) began work at six Casma Valley sites dating from Cotton Preceramic through Early Horizon. Strati- graphic cuts through the midden at San Diego yielded marine shells no longer typical of the area, but no cultivated plants. At Huaynuma they recovered 211</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY potatoes, other tubers, and lucuma from a terminal preceramic midden, while cotton, gourd, squash, beans, shell, and fish bone were found there and at Las Haldas. Tortugas and the inland mound complex of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke date to early Initial Period. Similar textiles, stone bowls, and subsistence inventories at the two sites suggest an exchange system like that proposed by the Pozorskis for the Moche Valley. Cultivated plants are common at Las Haldas, while architectural features and midden content suggest intensive seasonal shellfishing. The first evidence of maize comes from the Early Horizon, as found in the posttemple refuse at Las Haldas and at San Diego and Pampa Rosario, where cultivated plants are abundant. Michael Malpass (U of Wisconsin) has identified 68 probable preceramic occupations on and around the southwest slope of Cerro Las Lomas, 30 m south of Casma. Middens are shallow, with rare fish re- mains but abundant limpets, bivalves, sea urchins, and tillandsia. Perforators, graver tips, denticulates, and used flakes are common, but only 26 projectile points were found, usually of the large, flat-based, lanceolate type known first from Lauricocha; two of these sites had Paijan points. Another site with Pai- jan points located 50 m above Campanario Bay (where penguins and sea mammals still congregate), had no midden but 80 broken and unfinished points and much debitage. Malpass found no preceramic sites along the Sechin and Moxeke branches of the Casma but is continuing to survey around Lago Can- chiscocha, high in the Cordillera Negra, at the source of the Sechin, directly above Guitarrero Cave. The preceramic stage is also the focus of work by Joan Gero (U of Massachusetts) on lithic collections from the Callejon de Huaylas. She is now studying the worked stone excavated by Richard Burger (Dumbar- ton Oaks) at Huaricoto, where Preceramic through Formative period artifacts are seen to encode social information. Her analysis seeks to correlate economic change with stylistic change in the lithic assemblage; it appears that, as Huaricoto evolved in- to a nucleated village, the tools became more stan- dardized in materials and styles. Gero defines stylistic attributes as those that contrast in a regular fashion between functionally equivalent, but socially nonequivalent, contexts. The third (1980) season of Richard Burger and Lucy Burger at Huaricoto, in Marcara, concentrated on cuts as much as 5 m deep through the stratified midden. Early Initial Period ceramics of the Toril style (with similarities to Early Guafiape), first de- fined in Gary Vescelius' excavations for Cornell, were rediscovered in strata underneath those containing Huaricoto wares. Burger's collections from the well- stratified refuse should provide good control over the typological sequence from late preceramic through Early Horizon times; he also identified a preceramic stone platform that is one of the largest structures yet known at Huaricoto. In 1980 and 1981 Steven Wegner (U of California- Berkeley) worked at Balcon de Judas on the western edge of Huaraz, a strategic point along the main route between Huaraz and the Casma Valley from the Early Intermediate Period. Wegner dealt primari- ly with the major Recuay occupation dating A.D. 200 to 600. A significant sample of Recuay utilitarian pot- tery was recovered, consisting of coarseware; kaolin- ware pedestal bowls with painted decoration; highly burnished red and black bowls; and some slip-cast panpipe tubes. This inventory contrasts sharply with the elaborately modeled kaolinware vessels found in Recuay tombs, upon which the prevailing definition of the Recuay style is based. With the support of the German Volkswagon Foun- dation, Hernan Amat has begun a new investigation of Chavin de Huantar, planned to last 4 years and in- clude the publication of his earlier work at Chavin. Christine Rudecoff (Tucson, AZ) and associates have recorded 149 sites, about half with Formative occupations, in the upper Huallaga near Huanuco. Many have mounds and are located on terraces im- mediately above the floodplain. She has mapped and intensively collected 12 of them. Ramiro Matos (U of San Marcos) and John Rick (Stanford U) are conducting extensive excavations at Panaulauca Cave (Junin), while Deborah Pearsall (U of Missouri) is developing a new technique for the identification of the root and tuber fragments. Rick notes that the wider exposure used here, at least 5 x 6 m, ensures that scarce potsherds are recovered in all levels where pottery is present. He has also been able to identify and follow many structural features, including hearths, corrals, stone and post partitions, and an enigmatic (colonial?) post-lined trench across the mouth of the cave. Partitioning of floor space, and even alignment, vary from stratum to stratum, and suggest that occupation was intermittent or separated by lapses. In contrast to Pachamachay, potsherds are rare, domestic debris is important, and contemporary strata have stylistically distinct lithic assemblages. The Telarmachay (Junin) excavations, begun in 1975 by Daniele Lavallee of the CNRS, were conclud- ed in 1980 with her discovery of three burials associated with red ocher, artifacts, and ornaments. These were found at the bottom of the preceramic levels, but they will also be directly dated by radiocarbon. Some 100,000 faunal remains were analyzed by Jane Wheeler (Peabody Foundation) who thinks that camelids were domesticated here by 4300 B.C., based on the high percentage, at least 70%, of animals that died in the first few weeks of life. In modern llama and alpaca herds the equivalent rate is about 50%, due to bacillar diarrhea or enterotox- emia. This affliction, or something similar, is pre- sumed to have a long history in the Andes, perhaps dating from the beginning of domestication, corral- ing, and crowded conditions. Early reliance on camelids is also indicated by the high frequency of their bones identified at Telarmachay (90%), fol- lowed, in order, by those of taruga (a deer), viz- cachas, birds, small rodents, skunk, amphibians, and puma. In a northeastward extension of the Junin survey organized by Matos and Jeffrey Parsons, Charles Hastings (U of Michigan) spent a year in the Huasahuasi ceja de la montafia and montafia proper 212 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH of Chanchamayo. The object was to investigate prehistoric use of intermediate zones in the eastern Andes and to relate it to occupation of the adjacent sierra and montaiia at the same time level. Survey, mapping, and small-scale excavation along a 10-km wide transect, crossing puna, cloud forest, and mon- tafna, proved difficult. The earliest sites in the ceja appear to date to Late Intermediate times and evi- dence of Inca influence is surprisingly lacking. In the Chanchamayo lowlands a major trail linking Taruma and Campa territories, mentioned in seventeenth- century documents, has been located on the ground. Sites along the route and at either end were studied, but lack of a previously established ceramic chronology has impeded progress. Jorge Silva (U of San Marcos) and Kenneth Hirth (U of Kentucky) have been working in the middle Rimac since 1978, in a project which will eventually extend from one end of the drainage system to the other. They have been particularly interested in Late For- mative material from the middle valley and Jicamar- ca Quebrada. Laura Laurencich-Minelli (U of Bologna) writes that she has found, in the Ethnological Museum of Modena, an important collection of textiles from An- con dating from 1883; for which a catalog will be issued by the museum. She also found the field notes and other papers relating to the archaeological, ethnological, and ethnohistorical work in Bolivia of Federico Lunardi, papal nuncio to La Paz in 1937-38. Important parts of these will be published in 1981 in a symposium, held in Genoa, to honor Lunardi. Since 1976 Glendon Weir (Texas A &amp; M), Robert Benfer and Alice Benfer (U of Missouri) have studied preceramic Paloma, at the edge of the Chilca valley, a site formerly excavated by Frederic Engel (Na- tional Agrarian U). In addition to determining the prehistoric health, demography, and ecology of the village, they hope to advise Peruvian planners on the possibilities of reclamation of the desert lomas zone. It appears that increasing use between 6000 and 2500 B.C. degraded the fragile resources and en- vironment, and that the degradation was humanly, rather than climatically, induced. Palomans were then forced to emphasize exploitation of a wider range of resource zones, including the littoral, river valleys, and western flanks of the Andes within 50 km of the coast. Some 200 discrete skeletons suggest physical stress, marked by growth arrest lines and dental assymetry, despite intensive plant manipula- tion and food storage. However, mortality rates were moderate, except in infancy; population growth may have been controlled through infanticide and delay of childbearing. Maritime and riverine resources were utilized, but ultimately the problems of environmen- tal degradation may have produced solutions which included greater emphasis on sedentism and food production. SOUTHERN PERU. Numerous investigations at the city of Huari (Ayacucho) continue under the direction of William Isbell (SUNY-Binghamton). Isbell reports the discovery of a semisubterranean temple of cut stone blocks, built at the end of the Ear- ly Intermediate period, which likely predates the earliest Tiahuanacoid icons in Ayacucho. If so, an ancient and large interaction sphere may have linked Ayacucho with Cuzco and the altiplano. The earliest evidence of Huari on the south coast also precedes the appearance of Tiahuanacoid iconography, so Isbell considers that Huari was already the capital of a far-flung empire, even before altiplano religious themes appeared in Ayacucho. In Huari, Viracocha- pampa, Pikillaqta, and Jincamocco, the similarity of plans of temples and residences also argue for the in- tegrity of Huari and the polity it administered. Ex- cavations in the Moraduchayuq compound by Christine Brewster (SUNY-Binghamton) reveal a lack of artifacts associated with agriculture or known craft specialties. Data are said to suggest ritual drinking, implying occupation by administrative specialists. Immediately north of Moraduchayuq, Linda Spickard has found part of a circular building, other walls, and an area of probable luxury goods production. Spickard's cuts in the stratified refuse of various parts of Huari have not only yielded ceramics for detailed chronological studies, but they have also uncovered an Early Horizon building buried under 2.4 m of deposits. Jane Stone (Washington U) has studied the lithic artifacts from Huari with the aim of understanding both the technological process and the social and economic context. She hypothesizes long- distance trade for 85% of the materials used, specialized centers for stone tool production, and specialized production areas within Huari itself. Isbell proposes that technologically primitive tools segregated from the Huari boundary survey repre- sent an occupation by "early man." According to Isbell, Edward Lanning first suggested great antiqui- ty for these tools, relating them ot the earliest of R. S. MacNeish's lithic industries from Pikimachay. Katharina Schreiber (Arizona State Museum) has begun her intensive survey of the Carahuarazo Valley (Ayacucho) where Jincamocco is located. The purpose is to look at the impact of Huari and Inca im- perial expansion on the culture of a small and well- bounded valley. The valley of the Chicha River, which forms part of the boundary between the Departments of Ayacucho and Apurimac, is the scene of a project led by Monica Barnes and Frank Meddens, formerly of the University of London. From their work in 1978 and 1980, it is clear that the heavily terraced Chicha Valley has been an important population center since the Middle Horizon. According to Barnes, an unusual density of Late Intermediate sites, the terracing (much of which may be pre-Inca), and Cieza de Leon's naming of several towns as Chanca strongholds sug- gest that the Chica and Pampas valleys were impor- tant in the Later Intermediate Chanca confederation. They have also identified several important Inca sites, the large colonial mining town of Huayllaripa (which Guaman Poma placed "above Pampachiri"), and the sixteenth-century towns of Pampachiri, Lar- cay, and Soras. From Cieza and Guaman Poma it is known that Soras dates back to the Chanca con- federacy; San Pedro de Larcay retains its precolonial house walls, baths and ruined tambo; while Pam- 213</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY pachiri is especially interesting for its colonial cemetery with cist graves and sixteenth-century church surrounded by a massive stone wall and defensive ditch. A. Aveni (Colgate U) and R. T. Zuidema (U of Il- linois) have moved on to a study of the Nazca lines after completing their mapping of the ceque lines in and around Cuzco. These imaginary linear ray systems, emanating from the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, are reconstructed by connecting together Inca huacas that have retained their original place names or are located in postconquest documents. Some huacas and ceques are related to Incaic observations of the sun at horizon. To date, three astronomical observation centers have been identified, and the in- vestigators have pinpointed the placement of eight horizon pillars for marking the course of the sun. In their 1980 season Aveni and Zuidema also worked at Huanuco Pampa where similar ceque alignments were tentatively identified. With Luis Barreda (National U of Cuzco) Gordon McEwan (UT) plans to continue the project at the Huari site of Pikillacta 30 m south of Cuzco, extend- ing their survey to several other interacting sites in the Lucre Basin, in order to understand the impact of Huari on the Lucre Basin as a whole. They also will investigate the function of Pikillacta, particularly in light of the storage center hypothesis usually invoked to explain the absence of surface artifacts and the conjoined rooms (colccas) on the northwest side of the site. Michael Moseley and Robert Feldman (Field Museum) have begun feasibility studies for a long- term program of investigation and management of the patrimony of Moquegua which would draw upon international expertise, develop public education and tourism through the establishment of a regional museum and archaeological parks, and mature into a self-perpetuating Peruvian conservation program. Among the specific archaeological projects are the investigation of the famous desert line drawings and the mesa-top city of Cerro Baul. Just before his death Clifford Evans had been working with several members of the Institute of An- dean Research to plan a major project on the culture history of southern Peru. As he was a former presi- dent of the sponsoring institute, it is fitting that the collaborative project be named in his memory. John Murra (Cornell U and current president of IAR), Mario Rivera (U of Chile, Antofagasta), Elias Mujica (INDEA), Thomas Lynch (Cornell U), Heather Lechtman (MIT), and Craig Morris (American Museum of Natural History) will participate in the project, using anthropological, historical, and ar- chaeological data to examine coastal-highland in- teraction using Murra's concept of verticality. Thomas F. Lynch SOUTHERN CONE ARGENTINA. Northwest. Pedro Krapovickas (Universidad Nacional de La Plata "UNLP") is contin- uing research in the locality of Yavi, near the border with Bolivia in Jujuy Province. The current focus is the excavation of selected cave sites with rock art, to isolate elements for establishing a definitive chronology. A test pit in a large rockshelter called La Cueva, which itself lacked rock art, gave evidence of five cultural layers in 86 cm of deposit. The top layer pertained to recent historic times, but the other four are all preceramic. Most of the occupation in layer D seems to pertain to a lithic workshop for quartzite ar- tifacts, including triangular points with slightly con- vex sides, which Krapovickas associates with Late Preceramic times. Krapovickas also reports survey of a site 30 km west of Yavi, called Tafna, which has stone struc- tures and surface finds of ceramic pipes with conical feet, suggesting a rare Early Period agricultural set- tlement. Claudia Porgione de Pelissero and Norberto Pelissero (Instituto Interdisciplinario de Tilcara, Uni- versidad de Buenos Aires "UBA") undertook an ar- chaeological and ethnohistoric study of the late Pre- Hispanic village site of Quilmes in the Santa Maria Valley of Tucuman Province, with fieldwork directed by Norberto Pelissero and Horacio Difrieri. A museum at the site is due to open in 1981. Pelissero and Difrieri are also conducting excavations at the colonial site of Ibatin in Tucuman Province, to recon- struct the first Spanish settlement in Tucuman. Alicia Fernandez Distel (UBA), in collaboration, is completing an archaeological guide to Humahuaca Department of Jujuy Province and will be doing fur- ther work in Susques Department and in the eastern forests of Salta Province, including El Talar, previously excavated by Menghin. Her attempts to grow Lagenaria sp. at Tilcara (2,460 m elevation) in the Quebrada de Humahuaca were quite successful, demonstrating that such gourds, common in archaeo- logical sites there, can grow well at such elevations. Bernard Dougherty (UNLP and head of the Ar- chaeology Division, La Plata Museum) continues his research in the Las Capillas zone of Jujuy Province. He has found several single occupation sites on natural, shrub vegetation covered terraces. They have pottery assignable to the San Francisco Com- plex (ca. 600 B.C.-A.D. 300) of the forest zone just to the east, and other sites clearly tied to the Late Period of the Quebrada de Humahuaca, although they lack the stone constructions typical of the latter. Dougherty believes the earlier sites may pertain to groups regularly moving between the Western Forests and the mouth of the Quebrada de Huma- huaca, while the later sites suggest more sedentary groups linked to the Quebrada, the eastern Puna, and other sub-Andean zones. The research is being fi- nanced by the Secretaria de Ciencia y T6cnica, CONICET, and Buenos Aires Province. Under the direction of Dougherty, Ana Maria Fernandez and Elsa Leonor Zagaglia (Museo de La Plata) are surveying archaeologically unknown terri- tory in the Western Chaco between the Pilcomayo and Juramento Rivers, focusing on the early ceramic period and the possibility of significantly greater climatic variation in the past than the present, com- 214 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH plicating the reconstruction of extinct cultural pat- terns. They also suspect active communication be- tween central Bolivia and their region of study, around A.D. 900-1000. Pio Pablo Diaz (Director, Museo Arqueol6gico de Cachi) indicates several activities of his museum in Salta Province. Surveys registered two new sites in Luracatao Valley, six in the Department of Rosario de Lerma, and 14 in Cachi Department. Of these, four are preceramic, three are early ceramic, 14 are late ceramic, and one is of undetermined ceramic period affiliation. Working through the museum, Alberto Rex Gonzales and Maria Delia Arena have designed a plan of study for the Potrero de Payogasta Inca site in the Calchaqui Valleys for 1981. Pablo Diaz assisted John Hyslop in his study of the Inca road system through the region, where they recorded five new sites of apparent Inca affiliation. Hyslop (In- stitute of Andean Research, N.Y.) recently completed Inca road surveys in Chile and Ecuador, as well as at various localities in Argentina. Salvage work is continuing at the late Pre-Hispanic village site of Tero, near Cachi, where Pablo Diaz is being assisted by Diana Mazzanti and Marta Lo Celso; four radiocarbon dates were recently ob- tained for the site, provided by Gordon Pollard through a grant from NEH. The dates, which will help date ceramic styles of the Santa Maria complex, are among the first to be processed for a late site in the Calchaqui Valleys, and run from A.D. 1020 ? 130 (GX-7478) to A.D. 1435 ? 135 (GX-7477). Myrian Noemi Tarrag6 (Museo Arqueolo6gico de Cachi) reports that she is studying materials from several sites in the middle and upper Calchaqui Valley dating to early and late Pre-Hispanic ceramic periods. These include Campo Colorado, Potrero Ralo, Las Pailas, Huasa Ci6nega, Jaime, Potrero Guti6rrez, Tero, and Salvatierra. Preliminary results suggest a pattern in which the upper Rio Calchaqui settlements were culturally oriented to the puna and western forest zones around the time of Christ rather than to more central regions of northwest Argentina. Tarrag6 has also begun, with collaborators, a de- tailed analytical file on sixteenth-century ethnohis- toric documents for the northwest. Gordon C. Pollard (SUNY-Plattsburgh) is in the final stages of analysis of materials from 24 late Pre- Hispanic sites from the middle and upper Calchaqui Valleys, with support from NEH. Petrographic study, with the collaboration of James Olmsted, has identi- fied 13 ceramic wares which have localized geo- graphical and, perhaps, temporal distribution. A modal analysis of ceramic stylistic elements, which will give greater clarification to the internal and geographical variability of the Santa Maria ceramic tradition, is now in process. Six radiocarbon dates have been obtained for the Borgatta village site (SSalCac 16) near Cachi. Five are from a 1.6-m deep test pit into a refuse mound in an early sector of the village ruins, and range from A.D. 1095 ? 80 (I-11,290) to A.D. 1255 ? 80 (1-11,287) in a consis- tent series associated with polished and multicolor ceramics. The sixth date was for a black-on-cream child burial urn from another sector of the site, and was A.D. 1290 ? 80 (I-11,292). Surface ceramics in- dicate the site was occupied through the time of Inca presence in the region as well. Pollen study of the refuse mound test pit by Philip Walker is also nearing completion, with maize, grasses, and other plant species being represented. Lidia Baldini (UNLP) indicates her continued work on detailing and seriating ceramics, particularly burial urns, of the late Pre-Hispanic Santa Maria Complex of Salta and Tucuman Provinces. Baldini is finding several localized stylistic variations, and a complex pattern of tricolor versus bicolor decoration and form associations. Excavations are planned to provide additional contextual data. Baldini is also studying the early Hispanic period in the Santa Maria valley as well as Inca occupations in the Southern Andes. Rodolfo A. Raffino (UNLP) reports the systematic recording of sites in the middle Calchaqui Valley of Salta Province. For Molinos Department and the northern section of San Carlos Department, he and other researchers have located about 50 sites span- ning the entire sequence through Preceramic, Lower and Upper Formative, Regional Development, Inca, Indigenous-Hispanic, and Colonial. During 1981 the lower Calchaqui region will be surveyed. Raffino also has been investigating sites pertaining to Inca presence in various sectors of the northwest, including the Puna, the Quebrada del Toro, Suban- dean zones, the Calchaqui and Santa Maria valleys, Hualfin-Abaucan Valley, La Rioja, Mendoza, and San Juan, focusing on the effect of the Inca on house- hold manufactures, ceramics, religion, mining, and architecture. In 1980 the research was expanded to include zones of central Bolivia and northern and central Chile, resulting in a greater appreciation of Inca presence in the southern Andes. Raffino also has been analyzing aspects of the development of ar- chitecture and urbanism for different archaeological regions of Argentina, beginning with the Formative and tracing the process of increasing complexity to its height during the Regional Development Period. Considerable work is being carried out in the Ler- ma Valley, in Salta Province, by the Museo Arqueo- lo6gico de Salta which is directed by Leonor Nava- muel de Figueroa. Ercilia Navamuel, head of the scientific department, is studying the late Pre- Hispanic village site of Rinc6n de la Vifia, at the mouth of Las Conchas Quebrada, which has room clusters, paths, a plaza, altars, a metal workshop, a defensive wall, and an Inca component. A similar site, Tinti, in Rosario de Lerma Department, also is being investigated by Navamuel and Lidia Alfaro de Lanzone, in a joint project of the Salta Museum and the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia (INA). Both sites are undergoing stabilization and reconstruction for tourists and students. Between 1977 and 1980 Navamuel headed studies of Arawak sites of the Ler- ma Complex, particularly cultivation mounds and cemeteries of El Guayacan, La Pedrera, and other sites. As part of an effort to catalog sites for the Pro- vince, further surveys are being conducted in Luracatao, Amblayo, Guachipas, Lerma, and the Tastil and El Toro quebradas. Leonor Navamuel de 215</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figueroa has recently completed a study of rock art for the Province. Ana Maria Lorandi (UNLP) is studying Inca occu- pations in northwest Argentina, focusing on an ad- ministrative center called El Potrero, 4 km north of Andalgala in Catamarca Province. She is trying to determine the geographical and economic extent of the center's control, relations between the Inca and local populations, and the role of mitimaes brought from Santiago del Estero and installed in centers throughout the central Valliserrana region. Survey of El Potrero was carried out by Maria Elena Gonaldi, who recognized at least 3 groups of Inca architec- ture, as well as an aqueduct-the only one of Inca origin yet reported for the northwest. Lorandi hopes to identify the ethnic groups which produced the Yocavil and Famabalasto ceramics found in Inca sites, and to quantify the stylistic similarities be- tween those ceramics and ones from Santiago del Estero and southeast Bolivia, such as Mojocaya, Huruquilla, and Anco-Anco. With additional data drawn from sixteenth-century chroniclers, and iden- tification of Aymara and Quechua place names, Lorandi hopes to define the eastern frontier of Inca presence in the region of Tucuman. The work of Eleonora Mulvany de Pefialoza (UNLP) is centered on the El Alto and Santa Rosa Depart- ments of Catamarca Province. She is trying to test the hypothesis that the zone includes a cultural sequence transitional between the traditions of the Valliser- rana and Chaco-Santiaguefia subareas. Such a hypothesis is suggested by the geographically and en- vironmentally intermediate position of the zone. Survey and excavation have so far demonstrated the presence of some sites corresponding to the Chaco-Santiaguefio Tradition, while others pertain to a local tradition with stylistic ties to Early and Middle Period ceramic cultures of the Valliserrana subarea, evidenced at the sites of Las Canias (SCatRos 3) and Albigasta (SCatAlt 9). Mulvany is also working with Maria Semp6 de Gomez Llanes on a morphological typology of lithics of La Ci6naga, Hualfin Valley, corresponding to the La Cienaga Tradition defined earlier by Rex Gonzales. Hector Lahitte (UNLP) heads the Laboratorio de Analisis y Registro de Datos Antropolo6gicos, which addresses methodological problems of research and data recording in archaeology and other fields. The lab publishes a limited-circulation journal of its ac- tivities, recently including a punch-card code for recording and sorting archaeological architectural data for the early ceramic/agricultural period of the northwest, using the Cerro el Dique site as a model. Currently, Eduardo Berberian (Universidad Nacional de C6rdoba) and Horacio Calandra (UNLP) are for- mulating a research design for archaeological study of Tafi del Valle in Tucumfn Province, which will provide a wide range of descriptive data to resear- chers. Calandra and other personnel from the La Plata Museum began a second stage of research in the Sierras de Santa Barbara of Salta and Tucuman Provinces, involving intensive excavations at several previously recorded sites. Diana Susana Rolandi de Perrot (INA), having com- pleted a study of 150 Inca and early Hispanic textiles from the Rio Doncellas site of Jujuy Province, is now analyzing textiles from Inca Cueva in nearby Huma- huaca Department. The materials pertain to late preceramic hunter-gatherers with incipient agricul- ture, and have an associated C-14 date of 2130 B.C. In addition, Rolandi is undertaking a study of tradi- tional weaving on the puna of Jujuy, in a zone where two traditions coexist. One is the indigenous weaving done by women, which has maintained Quechua ter- minology and Pre-Hispanic motifs. The other tradi- tion is of Spanish origin, has different terminology, and is maintained by men. Lidia Carlota Alfaro de Lanzone (INA) has also been working in the Rio Doncellas Basin, on material from the Late, Middle, and perhaps Early ceramic periods. Work on the late Pre-Hispanic collections is complete, as is the archival documentation of the ear- ly conquest period. Maria Carlota Semp6 de G6mez Llanes (UNLP) is continuing research in the Hualfin and Abaucin valleys of Catamarca Province. Having previously de- fined the Saujil and Abaucan complexes, since 1977 she has been working in the Hualfin Valley, focusing especially on late Pre-Hispanic sites of the Bel6n Complex and its Inca connections. A stylistic analysis of the symbolism of La Aguada and La Cienaga ceramics in the La Plata Museum, is being assisted by Maria Ester Albek. The lab work is being supple- mented by excavations and cultural ecological analyses in the respective valleys of Catamarca Pro- vince. Sempe is also directing Cristina Scatolin's study of early habitation sites and burials related to Ci6naga in the western Aconquija region. West Central. Mariano Gambier (Universidad Nacional de San Juan) reports that the university's Museum and Institute of Archaeological Investi- gations has concluded excavations at early agricul- tural sites in San Juan Province, and the research results have been published in a volume entitled "La Cultura de Ansilta." A project focusing on later Pre- Hispanic farming and herding societies is continuing in the Valle de Iglesia of San Juan, involving 37 ex- cavations at various sites containing domestic herd animals, cotton, and peanuts, all below 30? south latitude. Excavations pertaining to late hunter-gatherers at nine sites falling between 30? and 37? south latitude, 70? west longitude have been concluded. Lab work is continuing on the huge quantities of recovered materials, and a final report on the findings will be entitled "La Cultura de Los Morrillos." Another proj- ect has been initiated, focusing on the Sierras Cen- trales of San Luis Province, seven sites having been excavated so far pertaining to farming and herding societies, with large associated polychrome rock art components. Study of the rock art is under the charge of Mario Consens, from Montevideo, Uruguay, who is using infrared, color filter, and monochromatic-light techniques to document and analyze the finds. The project is expected to conclude in 1982, and two monographs have already appeared on various aspects of the work. 216 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT RESEARCH Another ongoing project reported by Gambier focuses on sites with extinct fauna and possible human associations. To date, two cave sites have yielded remains of megatherium, including a skull, vertebrae, molars, and datable well-preserved feces. Two other cave sites contained remains of American horse, including feces, with Mylodon ribs and vertebrae also present. For each of these sites, Gambier indicates there are very doubtful cultural remains present. Survey in the San Guillermo Valley, always a preferred hunting zone and now a park reserve for vicufia, reveals artifacts estimated to be as old as 8000 B.P. The Museo de Historia Natural of San Rafael, directed by Humberto Antonio Lagiglia, is carrying out excavations at two sites in Mendoza Province. One of these, La Ventana de Puesto Viejo Cave, has yielded a layer pertaining to late ceramic-producing hunters. The other site, Ponon Trehue Cave, relates to a nonceramic, early agricultural occupation, possibly affiliated with the Atuel II tradition. One 60-cm layer encountered in the excavations yielded maize, zapallo (Cucurbita sp.), bones of armadillo, turtle, and birds, vegetable fiber, cordage, basketry, various lithics, and a stemmed point. In the course of these studies, Lagiglia recorded numerous other late hunter sites rich in lithics and ceramics in the zone of Nacientes de Los Leones. The Museum is also ex- cavating ruins of an early Hispanic mill and mining settlement, B6vedas de Uspallata, which was reused by General Jos6 de San Martin in 1817. J. Roberto Barcena (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo) is continuing his archaeological and bioanthropolog- ical studies, begun in 1974, of various sites in the nor- thwest portion of Mendoza Province. The work in- cludes detailed study of more than 100 km of Inca roads in the region, as well as the discovery of several tambos and other distinctive sites. The preceramic sequence, Del Tigre I-V, has been docu- mented with several stratified cave sites, with clear ties to traditions found by M. Gambier in southwest San Juan Province. The project has been aided by personnel from various institutes, including A. Cueto, E. Guercio, M. Ampuero, and A. Herrera. Patagonia. Hugo Daniel Yacobaccio (UBA) is undertaking several kinds of microwear studies related to various early hunting and gathering groups. One of these focuses on dismemberment pat- terns and butchering marks on mylodon and guanaco remains from Las Buitreras Cave in southern Patagonia, dating to about 10,000 B.P. L. A. Borrero and S. E. Caviglia are assisting in comparative ex- perimentation with carnivores, trying to duplicate marks found on archaeological bones. For the other end of the country, Yacobaccio is working on materials excavated under the direction of C. A. Aschero in 1978 and 1979 at the Inca Cueva c.4 cave site in the puna of Jujuy Province. The cave contains remains of a circular habitation unit dug into the natural sediments, the floor of which was formed by a covering of Stipa sp. Artifact associations are com- parable to those at Inca Cueva c.7 (4080 B.P.) and other south Andean archaic sites. The exceptionally good preservation permits microanalysis of artifact edges which still retain minute particles of the materials on which they were utilized, including camelid skin and wood, and should allow delineation of activity areas. Yacobaccio is also attempting to develop a model of zonal interrelations and group movement for the puna and adjacent zones of Jujuy and Salta Provinces during the late Pre-Hispanic period. Using rock art as an indicator, he is analyzing such variables as prox- imity to trails/roads, degree of visibility, and stylistic motifs to construct mobility models for known com- plexes/cultures. In mid-1980 Yacobaccio also con- ducted a survey of the Casabindo zone of the puna of Jujuy Province, where he recorded 18 sites. Three of these pertain to hunting groups who used lanceolate and triangular projectile points, five were rock art sites, and the others were late Pre-Hispanic, in- cluding one of Inca affiliation. Of this latter group, sites in the Quebrada de Tarante included a 6.5-km stretch of cultivation terraces, irrigation canals, sites with rectangular and circular habitation units, picto- graphs, and black-on-red ceramics. Similar finds were encountered in the Quebrada de Potrero. Luis Alberto Borrero (UBA) reports a number of activities related to his study of hunting and gather- ing groups of several localities of Patagonia in Argen- tina and Chile. In the lower section of the Rio Limay basin in Neuqu6n and Rio Negro Provinces, Argen- tina, he is investigating a simple lithic complex of mortars, small triangular points, and cutting instru- ments associated with a gathering economy, based on river mollusks, rodents, legumes, and rhea and other bird eggs. Unlike most other sites in Patagonia, the complex is practically devoid of guanaco re- mains. Radiocarbon dates place the industry be- tween 4500 and 500 B.P., with almost no change in technology or subsistence patterns through its entire span. In the Rio Gallegos basin of Santa Cruz Province, Borrero is studying materials from the Las Buitreras cave, excavated in collaboration with Sanguinetti. Lithic materials were recovered and associated animal remains, including mylodon, extinct horse and fox, guanaco, and dolphin (the site is some 70-80 km from the Atlantic coast). The materials are estimate-dated at about 10,000 B.P. Borrero is also attempting to find evidence of late guanaco hunters in a forest environment in the region of Seno de la Ultima Esperanza, Magallanes, Chile, especially in the Alero del Diablo rockshelter and Mylodon Cave. Immediate research is directed at recovering mylodon samples from levels 5 and 6 of Mylodon Cave to better document postglacial sur- vivals of that extinct mammal. Layer 7 of the exca- vations has guanaco bones associated with sharp- edged stone flakes and waste cores and has radio- carbon dates ranging from 5366 ? 55 B.P. to 5684 ? 52 B.P. Mylodon remains are found in layers above and below layer 7. In the Gulf of San Jorge region of Chubut Province, Argentina, Borrero is studying the coastal adaptation of hunters whose technology suggests they derived from the Patagonian interior. Their sites are shell 217</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY middens in which are found abundant remains of sea lions (primarily neonatals and perinatals, suggesting spring occupations), whales, dolphins, and fish. Borrero is also working in the northern section of Isla Grande of Tierra del Fuego, focusing on the system of territoriality of the Selk'nam who occupied the island as late as the beginning of this century. Ex- cavations at several sites in the old Elk territory near Bahia San Sebastian have yielded C-14 dates be- tween 900 and 100 B.P. All of these sites should help in understanding the peopling of Patagonia and transformations in diet and tool kits associated with different environments. Guillermo L. Mengoni Gofialons (UBA) has been working on the zooarchaeology of arid zones, partic- ularly southern Neuqu6n Province and the central plateau of Santa Cruz Province, Patagonia. In Neu- quen he has located 15 new cave or rockshelter sites, all with rock art. Two are planned for excavation in 1981, in a zone transitional between forest and steppe, in hopes of establishing a sequence for the region, which he expects to go back to ca. 9000 B.P. In Santa Cruz, by the time of this report Mengoni will have completed a third season at a central cave habitation with aceramic and ceramic phases of the Patagonia tradition. Maria Jos6 Figuerero Torres (UBA) is undertaking coprolite studies at the university's Instituto de Cien- cias Antropolo6gicas, using Callen's rehydration tech- nique on samples from both north and south Patagonia, along the middle Rio Limay and the lower Rio Gallegos, respectively. The only human coprolite so far comes from Las Buitreras Cave in Santa Cruz Province, in association with artifacts and probable mylodon remains which were dated at 9200 B.P. Carlos J. Gradin (Universidad del Salvador), a specialist on rock art, is currently in charge of in- vestigations in the area of Rio Pinturas, Santa Cruz Province. He is continuing excavations in the Alero Cardenas and Abrigo del Feo rockshelters, at other sites in the central plateau, and the southern zone of Chubut Province. He is also conducting excavations in an open campsite in the Rio Colorado basin of La Pampa Province, where he has obtained a culture se- quence related to that of the central sierras of San Luis. Carlos Aschero (UBA), also participating in the Rio Pinturas projects, is working at the Alero del Buho site, as well as at Cerro de los Indios, Lago Posadas zone, and Casa de Piedra, Lago Burmeister zone. He is also studying the Archaic in northern Jujuy Pro- vince. Ana M. Aguerre (UBA), another member of the Rio Pinturas investigations, is focusing on the earliest south Patagonian hunters. She is also searching the south central altiplano of Santa Cruz Province for stratified sites. In March 1980 she began work in the coastal zone of Puerto Deseado of the same province, attempting to study the cultural dynamics that operated between the precordillera, the central plateau, and the coast during postglacial times. Lidia R. Nacuzzi (Centro de Investigaciones Cien- tificas de Viedma) reports the continuation of the Pil- caniyeu Area Project of Rio Negro Province in north- ern Patagonia, initiated in 1978 with sponsorship of the CICV. The 1980 season involved two fieldwork periods of surveying and testing. Nacuzzi led one of these expeditions, with the main objective being to locate sites with topography, sedimentology, and rock art similar to those of the Abrigo de Pilcaniyeu rockshelter which had been studied by Nacuzzi and Maria T. Boschin through 1979. She found La Figura, a rockshelter whose rock art reproduced the petro- glyph footprints and pictograph geometric motifs of the Pilcaniyeu site. Test excavations demonstrate the existence of a distinct north Patagonian complex with a stone industry, including large implements and small, scrapers and stemmed projectile points. Luis Abel Orquera (Universidad Nacional del Com- ahue and Asociaci6n de Investigaciones Antropo- lo6gicas), in collaboration with Arturo Emilio Sala, Ernesto Luis Piana, and Alicia Hayd6e Tapia, is con- tinuing investigations in the Beagle Channel region of Tierra del Fuego. In early 1980 they excavated the Tufinel site on a large scale, obtaining many data to amplify the distributional and paleoenvironmental in- formation from previous field seasons. The Tfnel site has two cultural components dating about 6000 B.C. and 4100-3900 B.C., the younger of which inter- digitates with the subsequent Lancha Pakewaia se- quence as part of a tradition which continues into the ethnographically known Yamana Indians. Rita Ceballos (Universidad Nacional de Rosario) reports the continuation of a project begun in 1972 through an agreement between her university and the Centro de Investigaciones Cientificas of Rio Negro Province, involving survey and excavations along the Rio Pichileufu in Rio Negro Province, with the current focus being the Cueva Visconti site. Materials pertain to north Patagonian collectors and guanaco hunters. A primary focus of the research is to determine the Pre-Hispanic technological and resource procurement changes in the region. The 1981 field season will include the assistance of An- tonio Peronja, Maria Eugenia Astiz, and Ana Carmen Fernandez. Pampas. Gustavo G. Politis (UNLP), with colla- borators, has been investigating several cave sites in the Pampa Bonaerense region of Buenos Aires Pro- vince. One of these, Arroyo Seco 2, has at least three occupation layers, the oldest of which lacks projec- tile points and has associations of extinct Pleistocene fauna: megatherium, mylodon, macrauchenia, butatus, and American horse. Under this layer were 14 human skeletons, some with artifact inclusions, which appear associated with the immediately overlying deposits. The upper layers lack extinct fauna but have projectile points along with guanaco and deer remains. The other site, Zanj6n Seco 1, is also yielding guanaco and deer bones, which are be- ing studied to determine hunting and butchering pat- terns. Also from the UNLP, Maria de las Mercedes P6rez Meroni is beginning a systematic study of three zones in Buenos Aires Province: (1) the Lagunas El Maestro and La Limpia, (2) Laguna Sauce Grande, and (3) Lago Epecu6n. The first two are near the Atlantic 218 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT RESEARCH coast, and research is focusing on processes of cultural ecological adaptations for the Pampa Bonaerense region. Alicia Susana Castro de Aguilar (UNLP) is working in southern Buenos Aires Province, between the Sier- ras de Ventania and the lower Rio Negro. This poorly known zone seems to have been an important one for contact between Patagonian and Pampean groups, and sites pertaining to both complexes have been found. The Pampa-related sites are aceramic, while the others have arrow points and ceramics. A lithic typology has been established which systematically distinguishes the two complexes. Lowlands. For the delta regions of Argentina, Maria Amanda Caggiano (UNLP) reports intensive excavations in various "mound" sites along the lower reaches of the Parana Ibicuy and Parana Guazu. The testing has identified stratified occupation layers of diverse cultural and sedimentological materials, with asssociated human burials. Caggiano indicates the finds provide the first evidence of superimposed cultural strata in that region, which she has been in- vestigating systematically since 1975. Antonio Rizzo (UNLP) has begun a project in Mi- siones Province (departments of Eldorado and General Manuel Belgrano) to establish the Pre- Hispanic sequence. Sites investigated so far have evidenced a specialized hunting stage previously unrecognized for the region, as well as a poorly known ceramic tradition called Eldoradense. Lab study of faunal, floral, and pollen remains, plus radiocarbon dating, is being undertaken. In another interdisciplinary project, Rizzo is also working in the lower Rio Uruguay region where one site, Rinc6n de Landa, has proven to be Pre-Guarani and Pre- Hispanic, and promises to yield data on environment, diet, and hunting and fishing patterns. Rizzo has been designated Director of the Depart- amento de Antropologia y Arqueologia Regionales, created in 1979, of the Centro de Investigaciones Hist6ricas of the Instituto Superior of Posadas, Mi- siones. The department will develop research in the province, as well as seminars, exhibitions, and con- ferences. Similar functions will be provided by the Departamento de Arqueologia, also created in 1979, of the Escuela Nacional Normal Superior of Concep- ci6n del Uruguay, Entre Rios. The Museo Municipal de Eldorado, Misiones, has also been reactivated, with Maria Susana Mastrovito de Schiavo being Director. Carlos Ceruti (Museo de Ciencias Naturales y An- tropolo6gicas, Parana) reports his department's in- volvement in a large dam-site salvage project for the middle section of the Rio Parana between Villa Ur- quiza and Guayquirar6. The project began in 1978, will continue until 1990, and includes the collabora- tion of the Direcci6n de Cultura of Entre Rios Pro- vince, the municipality of La Paz, the Empresa Agua y Energia Electrica, and the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. The initial survey phase is now completed, and 1981 will begin a selected excavation phase. To date, La Paz Department yielded 30 sites, five of which pertain to the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies, and those remaining pertain to the Goya- Malabrigo Pre-Hispanic Tradition of hunters, fishers, and horticulturalists with Amazonian in- fluence, dated between A.D. 1000-1500. From the eastern side of Entre Rios Province, Jorge A. Rodriguez (Centro de Investigaciones Regionales, Concordia) sends word of another dam-site survey, that of the Salto Grande Project designed by him and coordinated by Amilcar Rodriguez. The affected area is the middle Rio Uruguay, and involves Argentina and Uruguay. Surveys between 1977 and 1979 located 70 sites on the Argentinian side, 75% of which will be inundated, and 20 of which have been excavated. Both aceramic and ceramic sites are present and seem to span from about 6000 B.C. to European arrival. Preliminary results include the identification of a series of "culture types" ranging in time from before 4500 B.C. to Tupi Guarani groups present at European contact, and comprising dif- ferent ceramic types and artifact classes. Studies will continue, analyzing geological, paleoecological, paleozoological, and ethnohistoric evidence. Maria Mercedes Podesta de Wechsler (INA) is undertaking a morphological study of lowland and coastal ceramics from Argentina, as part of a larger project with Antonio Austral on the major ceramic forms for the entire country. In 1981 Podesta began a field study of cultural development in the littoral zone of northern Corrientes Province, along the Rio Parana where a new hydroelectric dam will inundate a rich archaeological sector. Particular attention will be given to Guarani sites. CHILE. The Sociedad Chilena de Arqueologia, under the auspices of the Museo Arqueolo6gico de la Serena, will hold the IXth Congreso de Arqueologia Chilena in October 1982, in La Serena. The Univer- sidad del Norte, Arica, has reactivated the journal Chungar6 with issue no. 6, 1980. The new Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino in Santiago (Casilla 3687), established by the Fundaci6n Familia Larrain Echenique, was inaugurated early in 1981. The museum has an important private collec- tion of Pre-Columbian objects from all over the Americas and will carry out research and conser- vation projects in Chile. Its director is Carlos Aldunate del Solar. The Centro de Documentaci6n e Informaci6n (CEDOC) of the Universidad del Norte in An- tofagasta, directed by Drahomira Srytrova, is preparing a three-volume bibliography of all an- thropological and archaeological works pertaining to northern Chile, southern Peru, western Bolivia, and northwest Argentina, compiled by Liliana Cordero Vitaglio. The three volumes will be on the Preceramic Period, Ceramic Period, and General Topics, and will include ca. 11,000 entries. A systematic inventory also is being made of private and institutional libraries. Readers are reminded that CEDOC welcomes the receipt of reprints or copies of any publication or paper deemed of interest to research- ers in that area of South America. A second CEDOC project, headed by Juan Arturo Fuentes Villegas, involves the cataloging of the ap- 219</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY proximately 8,000 archaeological, anthropological, and historical works in the "Julio Montane Collec- tion" of the Archaeology Department of the Univer- sidad del Norte. The unique collection, to be updated with post-1973 materials, will be made available for use through the university. North. Guillermo Focacci A. (Universidad del Norte, Arica) sends word of his continuing research along the coast of Arica, where he is excavating a cemetery which is near the Pucara in San Lorenzo. Ivan Mufioz has done an evaluation of preceramic settlement patterns for the coast of Quiani and La Capilla, with emphasis on the role of various natural resources in generating the zone's economy. For the lower northern valleys he has also initiated a study of the Cerro Sombrero and San Lorenzo habitation sites and local rock art. Liliano Ulloa is analyzing and con- serving ceramic stage textiles from coastal and valley sites, with the objective of providing a stylistic sequence for that northern zone. Calogero Santoro has been working in the altiplano above Arica, in conjunction with the Corporaci6n Nacional Forestal. He has found and surveyed 80 sites, including preceramic rockshelters, pictograph sites, small en- campments of late pastoralists, and large defensive village sites in the sierra. Initial C-14 dates pertain to the late preceramic, around 2000 B.C. The joint paleopathology project of the Univer- sidad del Norte and the Medical College of Virginia, funded by the National Geographic Society, is con- tinuing and involves the multidisciplinary efforts of Marvin Allison and Enrique Gerszten (Medical Col- lege of Virginia), Juan Munizaga (Universidad de Chile "UC"), Guillermo Focacci, and Calogero Santoro. Using mummified human specimens from the Museo San Miguel de Azapa, as well as newly excavated re- mains from the coast and the Azapa Valley (dating from 1300 B.C. to A.D. 1100), states of health, pathol- ogies, and cause of death are being determined for various Pre-Hispanic populations. Hans Niemeyer F. (Santiago) and Virgilio Schiap- pacasse (UC, Santiago), aided by Silvia Quevedo K. (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural), have com- pleted their seventeenth field season in the lower Camarones Valley. The recent investigations includ- ed survey of a 12-ha late village site of the Arica (Pocoma-Gentilar) Culture Complex, the largest site yet recorded for the Complex. They also excavated several structures at the village site Desembocadura Camarones Norte, of unspecified ceramic stage affil- iation, which overlies a preceramic occupation. A third activity was final survey of the Camarones 14 site of the Anzuelo de Concha Culture of about 7000 B.P. Further work demonstrates a pattern of trans- humance between the lower and middle portions of the Camarones Valley. Schiappacasse, Niemeyer, Quevedo, and Patricio Urquieta have been excavating the preceramic coastal cemetery of Punta Teatinos located 10 km north of La Serena, Coquimbo Province. So far, 186 skeletons have been recovered and are still being studied. The site is dated between 3500 and 4000 B.P., and another field season is planned for 1981. Miguel Cervellino G. has been working with Niemeyer and Quevedo at another cemetery, in the interior of Copiap6 Valley, near the edge of a vega at El Torin. It consists of stone cairn burials similar to those of El Molle Complex, Rio Huasco Phase, most of which have multiple interments of flexed individuals. Some skeletons have lip plugs and scarce offerings of black ceramics. By the time of this report a third field season will have been completed. Niemeyer describes one other long-term project, a study of the Inca impact on indigenous cultures of the Rio Copiap6 basin, focused particularly on construc- tion techniques, metallurgy, transportation, and vega exploitation. Sergio Chac6n C. (UC, Arica) sends word of several ongoing projects: (1) investigation of early hunting campsites at the mouth of the Rio Camarones, which have C-14 dates of 6500 B.P., (2) restoration of rock art in the Lluta and Azapa Valleys, (3) restoration of the Pucara de Copaquilla in Arica Province, and (4) study of sites in the pre-cordillera of Arica, with a C-14 date of 7750 B.C. Chacon indicates that the Museo Regional de Arica is now known as the Museo San Miguel de Azapa. Chac6n, Luis Alvarez M., and Percy Dauelsberg H. had originally founded the museum in 1959. Julio A. Sanhueza Tapia (UC, Arica) is continuing a project begun in 1978 aimed at delineating the culture sequence for the altiplano de Isluga (4200 m elev.), Iquique Province. The research began under the auspices of the Universidad del Norte and is sponsored by the Universidad de Chile through 1981. In another project Sanhueza is beginning an ecolog- ically oriented study of the prehistory of the desert coastal zone south of Iquique, focusing on diet and nutrition in the period between 3000 B.C. and A.D. 1000. In conjunction with Alfredo Loayza B. and Rodrigo Avalos, Sanhueza has also begun a complete review and computerized cataloging of the Iquique Museum's holdings, which include collections from the sites of Cfanamo 3, Caleta Huelen 42, Tarapaca 40, lithics from Rinconada, and the Nielsen Collec- tion from various north coast sites. The Museo de Historia Natural de Valparaiso has a collection of artificially mummified human remains from northern coastal Chile which are associated with the Chinchorro Complex. These are the subject of research by Jaime Vera Villarroel (MHNV) and Jaime Rodriguez (Instituto Arqueolo6gico de Valparaiso) to document and describe the basic physical characteristics (including pathologies) and burial patterns associated with the unique group, and to date and conserve the specimens. In a separate note, Silvia Quevedo (Museo Na- cional de Historia Natural) indicates she has anal- yzed 22 artificially mummified burials of the Chin- chorro Complex as part of her work with Niemeyer and Schiappacasse in the Camarones Valley. C-14 dates for the material fall between 5440 and 4600 B.C. Quevedo has also been working on Pre-Hispanic skeletal remains of 93 individuals from three secondary-burial rockshelters in Toconce, upper Rio Loa region. Paleodemographic reconstruction is be- ing supplemented by a study of dental eruption pat- 220 [Vol. 47, No. 1, 1982]</page><page sequence="20">CURRENT RESEARCH terns and maxillary facial development of all children in the present town of Toconce. Further, she is studying age-related morphological changes in the pubic symphysis in contemporary specimens of known age and sex to refine the use of that feature for determining age at death. Working with H. Palomino, she is also trying to construct an evolu- tionary distributional model of prehistoric Chilean populations, based on measurements related to the masticatory apparatus, including dental and occlusal features. Horacio Larrain (Pontificia Universidad Cat6olica de Chile) is coordinating a multidisciplinary study of the use of various water sources along the Chilean coastal desert. The work includes the collaboration of a physical geographer, Pilar Cereceda T., and a hydrogeologist, Joaquin Sanchez R., with the assistance of Nazareno Carvajal and Carlos Oster- mann S. Within a 280 km2 area, they have so far located 12 water sources and are examining the possibilities of aquifer rejuvenation, and the capacity of coastal cloud banks to produce retrievable water. The archaeological component of the research has located 32 shell mound sites, which are found on the 20-25 m terrace and the 150-175 m terrace, those near the shore being larger than those further away. The latter sites are at permanent water sources or next to quebradas which are dry today. A research goal is the isolation of the cultural indicators of water source distribution. Victoria Castro R., Jos6 Berenguer R., and Carlos Aldunate S. (all UC, Santiago) have been working in Toconce, upper Rio Loa, at a chullpa site which has an associated habitation sector and rockshelter burials. Materials recovered so far pertain to the Late Period between A.D. 900 and 1450, and corres- pond to a society of pastoralists and agriculturalists of Bolivian altiplano origin. This identification is based on ceramics, chulipas, and small ceremonial structures, similar to ones described for southwest Bolivia. The upper Loa region shows an interaction with altiplano and circum-puna cultural elements, with the Toconce occupation suggesting a terminal expression of a process involving Wankarani and Tiwanaku influence. The researchers have under- taken a direct historical approach of comparison and interpretation with the largely Aymara-derived population of Toconce, crosscutting the archaeolog- ical, historical, and contemporary periods. Present religious and mortuary practices are seen as a par- ticularly useful source for interpretive projections in- to the past. The project includes an ethnobotanical study of the use and perception of wild flora by Toconce in- habitants, recently concluded by Carolina Villagran and Juan Armesto. This work has produced: (1) a demonstration of optimal knowledge and utilization of such resources, (2) an empirical definition of ecological units within the landscape, (3) a native categorization of environmental knowledge com- parable to the classification systems of botany and ecology, and (4) a standardization of environmental knowledge which is the basis of a pattern of resource utilization by pastoralists. A final component of the research is a study of rock art in the Santa Barbara zone of the Rio Loa, which has yielded representations of "sacrifices" and "double staff figures," and suggests Tiwanaku connections. Other scenes invoke visions of herders and llama caravans, while multicolored pictographs are said to be like anthropomorphic figures on Belen bronze discs in northwest Argentina. The Santa Bar- bara zone is thus viewed as an important route for early traffic from and along the altiplano. M. Antonia Benavente A. (UC, Santiago) has been working with Carlos Thomas W. in the ChiuChiu/ Lasana zone of the middle Rio Loa to determine pro- cesses of cultural change during the entire Pre- Hispanic period, as these relate to subsistence shifts, demographic effects, and the influence of nonlocal cultures. For the late preceramic period, they are correlating microenvironments with various "micro- lith" sites. For the early ceramic period, work has centered on a pit house site at ChiuChiu (site 200, previously identified as RAnL 88), from a pastoral group with connections to the Pacific Coast, the southern altiplano, and northwest Argentina. For the late Pre-Hispanic period they note the apparent im- portance of new ritual elements, including the snuff- ing complex (related to the Tiwanaku) and the "wall and box" ceremonial sites which may also have altiplano connections. In conjunction with personnel from the Universidad Cat6lica de Santiago, Bena- vente and Thomas are also working at a cemetery site in the Parque la Quintrala, La Reina, in central Chile, where they are doing a ceramic seriation of ex- cavated materials, and thermoluminescent dating. For several years, Gast6n Castillo Gomez (Museo Arqueol6gico de La Serena) has been involved in a study of the El Molle Culture Complex of the Coquim- bo region, and the transition between hunter- gatherers and early sedentary agriculturalists. Re- cent investigations include surveys of Valle del Hur- tado, Llano de San Agustin, Estero del Toro, Pabello6n, El Chafiar, El Farello6n, and La Turquia, 1979; survey and excavations in the Elqui Valley, La Fortaleza, and El Molle, 1979-1980; compilation of published and unpublished material on El Molle, 1980; production of a base map of work done, 1980; and revision and cataloging of all El Molle collections in the La Serena Museum (in progress). A second project of Castillo and Ivo Kuzmanic is a multidisciplinary study, with geographers, botanists, and historians, of the Coquimbo coastal basin, aimed at producing elementary and secondary educational materials fostering an appreciation of scientific pro- cedures and a concern for environment and cultural heritage. One such unit, on the prehistory of the Norte Chico, is in preparation. Miguel Cervellino Giannoni (Director, Museo Regional de Atacama, Copiap6) sends details of five projects being carried out through his newly formed museum. The first, with the participation of H. Niemeyer, A. Duran, R. C6spedes, J. Borquez, and L. Catalan, is a 2-year study of rock art in the entire Norte Chico region. Objectives include the register- ing, photographic documentation, mapping, cultural contextual analysis, and publication of materials 221</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY from as many sites as possible. Tours of rock art sites are planned, to attract specialists and educators as well as tourists. A second project is a full study of Pre-Hispanic set- tlement in the Copiap6 Valley. Project participants include Cervellino, Duran, C6spedes, Catalfn, D. Bruna, and A. Ferreira. A third project, with the same personnel plus Kuz- manic, deals with water resources and their relation to Pre-Hispanic settlement in coastal zones from Taltal to Huasco. Correlations are being sought be- tween types and location of resources, climatic and topographic factors in resource exploitation, group mobility, and inland resource exploitation by various archaeologically known groups. Comparative data on present coastal fishers in the region are also being obtained. Survey and excavation to detail Pre-Hispanic set- tlement patterns and ecological adaptations in the Finca Chanaral district will be directed by Angel Duran. Cervellino is also in charge of the restoration of the historic site known as Fuerte Juan Bohon in Los Loros district of Copiap6. Central. Jaime Vera Villarroel (Museo de Historia Natural de Valparaiso) gives news of the creation of a new private research organization in Vifia del Mar: the Instituto Arqueol6gico de Valparaiso (IAV). Formed in March 1980, its elected Director is Jorge Silva Olivares, a founding member of the Sociedad Chilena de Arqueologia and pro- fessor at the Universidad de Chile, Valparaiso. The Institute has as its main area of geographical con- cern the north-central zone of Chile, between the Choapa and Maule rivers. The IAV wishes to estab- lish contact with researchers interested in studies related to north-central Chile. It is located at the Museo de Historia Natural, Calle Valparaiso 155, Vifia del Mar, Casilla de Correos 925. One of the current projects of IAV, in conjunction with the Museo de Historia Natural de Valparaiso, is a program designed to document the prehistory and early history of the zone between the Choapa and Maule rivers, from ca. 15,000 B.C. to the mid 1800s, including physical anthropological studies. Eliana Duran Serrano (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural-MNHN) is chief investigator of the Museum's Anthropology Section, which has as a basic project "The Archaeology of Central Chile." Duran Serrano's particular focus is an overall study of the Aconcagua Complex, which has a C-14 date of A.D. 1000. She is also participating in a study of the biological evolution of populations of the Azapa Valley, especially the Max Uhle and Julio Montane Collection of cultural materials. Other researchers in the project are Silvia Quevado, Francisco Rothamer, Elena Llop, Jos6 A. Cocilovo, Osvaldo Mendonca, and M. Castro. Quevado adds that the group has exam- ined 200 osteological specimens from the Archaic and Formative periods. One other project is the con- servation of the Cerro El Plomo Inca child mummy, for which expert assistance has been requested through UNESCO. Rub6n Stehberg (MNHN), with financing from UNESCO, is in the final stages of a study and restora- tion of the Huechfn-Chacabuco mound cemetery. Field and lab study has been completed, and the final report is in press. Restoration and fencing has begun, and a possible site museum is planned. In a joint project with Carlos Maturana, Stehberg is in the second year of a 3-year study of human adaptations to the middle cordillera of Santiago. Ecological subzones have been identified, and results of excavations of rockshelters and surface collec- tions from lithic workshops are being supplemented with ethnohistoric data to bring the analysis into later historic times. This has included study of herd management of the nineteenth-century Condes Ha- cienda, with estimation of the native population that could have been supported by camelid herds in the zone. Another project with Andr6s Pinto Pic6 (Museo Hist6rico Nacional) involves excavations at El Salitral and El Carrizo rockshelters on the Cuestra de Chacabuco, north of Santiago, with funding from the Direcci6n de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos. Jos6 Berenguer R. (UC, Santiago) indicates his in- vestigation, with Osvaldo Silva G., of a settlement of the Aconcagua Complex in Lampa, the northern sec- tor of Santiago Basin and its relation to Inca and ear- ly Spanish groups. The project is in its early phases and has included surveys, test excavations, and ethnohistoric research. Marco Sanchez A. and Consuelo Vald6s Ch. (both Museo Araucano Regional, Temuco) indicate that their museum has combined with other institutions, such as the Dillman Bullock and Cafiete Museums, to begin a systematic program of survey and excavation for defining and dating the local sequence. The pro- gram has already identified the Tfimulos Cemetery site in the Cholchol zone of Cautin Province, soon to be excavated. Americo Gordon (Temuco) is involved in the study of the so-called Llaima petroglyphs in south-central Chile, which he suspects were made by hunters rather than by agriculturalists as has been suggested by Menghin and Schobinger. Gordon has also exca- vated the looted cemetery of Altos de Huimpil, Cautin Province, with ceramics of the Pitrense Complex. Several new ceramic types have come to light, in- cluding black on red, incised, and negative painted. An associated C-14 date is A.D. 660 + 80 (GIF-4984). BOLIVIA. David Browman (Washington U) reports on two phases newly defined in Chiripa research which are earlier than other Chiripa materials and were isolated on the basis of archi- tectural and ceramic features, and 22 radiocarbon and thermoluminescent determinations. The earlier phase, Condori (1350-850 B.C.), has the earliest recovered ceramics from the Bolivian area. The wares are predominantly polished dark brown, with mica temper, and decorated with slips and incised or grooved geometric designs. The second phase, Llusco (850-600 B.C.), marks the beginning of accumulation of the mound at Chiripa, and the beginning of painted decoration in both bichrome and polychrome, fiber tempering, and geometric designs with rectilinear motifs. The third phase, Mamani or Classic Chiripa (600-200/100 B.C.), marks the construction of the first Chiripa temple (later rebuilt in Tiwanaku III 222 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="22">CURRENT RESEARCH times, A.D. 125-375) and the appearance of pre- Chavin religious themes in stone sculpture. Long- distance trade in sumptuary goods can be identified in both Condori and Llusco periods and increases later. Trace element analyses have shown that (1) ob- sidian is not being secured from the reported flows 75 km east, but rather from two sources to the north: the Tumuku type, whose source is believed to be in Puno, about 150 km north, and the Titicaca Basin type, whose source is believed to be somewhere in Arequipa Department about 600 km north; in later times the latter type predominates; (2) copper in the early levels was not from the copper mine 30 km south, or other nearby sources, but rather was antlerite and brochantite, ores found only in northern Chile; (3) sodalite for beads came from the mines at Cerro Sapo in Cochabamba 175 km southeast; and (4) limestone used in part of the first temple construction was from sources on the other side of the "little lake," 30 km distant, representing an earlier (Chiripa phase) examples of the transport of building stone than that known from Tiwanaku around A.D. 300-400. All aspects of analysis, except the archaeo- zoological studies, are complete and publication is expected soon. Alan Kolata (Field Museum of Natural History) worked in 1979 in conjunction with Carlos Ponce Sanguines and the Instituto Nacional de Arqueologia. Focusing on the Pampas Koani and Wilajawira zones 10 km north of Tiwanaku near the Taraco peninsula on Lake Titicaca, Kolata conducted survey and ex- cavations in a 50-km2 area of ridged fields associated with more than 50 Pre-Hispanic artificial mounds. The latter ranged from small, perhaps seasonally occupied habitation mounds to a "twin pyramid" architectural complex (PCP-5 and 6) of tremendous size (terraced mound measuring ca. 120 x 75 x 3.5 m). Seventeen excavations were carried out in six of the larger mounds and in three fossil field plots with small mounds. Each of the large mounds yielded large quantities of high quality Tiwanaku 1, 3, 4, and 5 ceramics in Ponce's classi- fication, identified by Oswaldo Rivera (Instituto Na- cional), plus smaller amounts of Inca and possibly Mollo ceramics from the surface and near-surface strata in the excavations. Deeper strata in mounds PCP-1 and 3 yielded Chiripa ceramics. Preliminary evidence indicates the zone was occupied, and prob- ably farmed, beginning as early as 1000 B.C. URUGUAY. Wesley Hurt (Indiana University Museum "IUM") reports his 1980 survey of high ter- races and tributaries of the Rio Uruguay. Sponsored by IUM, the Museo de Historia Natural de Salto, and Intendencia Municipal de Salto, the surveys were a follow-up to the 1978 UNESCO project in the Salto Grande Reservoir, which had been confined to the floodplain. The recent surveys explored the Arapey River upstream from the Termas de Arapey, and the Tangarupa, Valentin Grande, and Valentin Chica tributaries, as well as the Cascades of San Niconar zone on the Rio Daymon. Near natural dykes along these rivers was found evidence of a lithic projectile point complex similar to one encountered in the 1978 survey, dated to a maximum age of 10,500 B.P. Higher terrace sites, however, yielded a lithic assem- blage named the Tangarupa complex, which appears related to the poorly defined Catalan industry fur- ther north in Uruguay. The new complex lacks pro- jectile points but includes large, quartzite, unifacial flake tools reminiscent of the Altoparanensa bifacial "boomerangs," as well as blades with pointed ends or single-worked edges, drills, and numerous scraper types. Hurt feels that the Tangarupa complex found on the higher river terraces is older than the industry with projectile points, but more information will be necessary to resolve the relationship between the two industries. Gordon C. Pollard SOUTHEAST ALABAMA. The University of Alabama and the Alabama Museum of Natural History Archaeological Field School conducted field investigations at Mound State Monument. Under the direction of J. 0. Vogel and David Alford the 1980 field season continued a research program designed to trace the fortifications which once enclosed the Indian town of Moundville. Evidence from the sequentially constructed en- closures should allow finer estimates of site pa- rameters, population size, organization, and social ordering of the Mississippian town. Although some sort of fortification system is to be expected at a major Mississippian ceremonial/ad- ministrative center, the main enceinte at Moundville has become known only as a result of the university's investigations during the past three field seasons. As of now, nearly 80 m of two distinct and separate for- tification systems have been uncovered. The earliest evidence (Fortification System I) consists of long stretches of curtain wall braced by stout posts- some of which apparently supported some type of elevated covered way-a simple gateway, and rec- tangular, three-sided bastion structures. A second, deep (2 m) wall trench, parallel to a por- tion of Fortification System I (although abutted at one point to the main curtain of F.S. I), is now thought to be not a simple ancillary structure but a curtain wall in its own right. Whether it was built before F.S. I, modified it, or was a rebuilding prior to the construc- tion of later structures was investigated in sum- mer 1981. The complex series of building stages designated as Fortification System II intersects and superim- poses upon the earlier fortifications. This system of curtain walls and projecting rectangular three-sided bastions was rebuilt at least three (or possibly four) times. In one of these reconstructions an elaborate bastion with walls across its gorge and some type of roofing supports was erected, suggesting an elevated covered way. A third system, newly discovered, re- mains to be investigated. Together, these palisade systems indicate at least seven stages of construc- tion, modification, and repair in this portion of the site. 223</page><page sequence="23">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FLORIDA. Research is being undertaken on submerged prehistoric sites in Tampa Bay and near- by bays on the central Gulf Coast of Florida. The drowned sites offer an opportunity to study aspects of aboriginal settlement systems now under water (and not represented on land today) as well as the ef- fect of Holocene sea level rise on adaptations. Work is being done by Albert C. Goodyear and Mark J. Brooks (Institute of Archeology and Anthropology, University of South Carolina) and a geologist, Sam B. Upchurch (University of South Florida). Sherwood Gagliano (Coastal Environments, Inc.) joined the study in 1981 to provide a perspective on Quaternary coastal processes. Sites are in relatively shallow water and were dis- covered over the past 20 years through hydraulic dredging of the bay bottoms. Lithic artifacts predom- inate and date from paleo-Indian through Late Archaic-Early Woodland. One site, Turtlecrawl Point, located on Upper Boca Ciega Bay, has been used as a pilot study to reconstruct the submarine geological context from artifact-bearing dredge soil sediments and from Army Corp of Engineers dredge plans. A clam shell (Mercenaria campechiensis) mid- den is suggested at the site by large numbers of very fragmented shells. Radiocarbon dates are currently being run on clam shells and columella gouges. Lithic artifacts include Early Archaic and Middle to Late Archaic stemmed projectile points. The site appears to be preceramic. Field agents from the Underwater Archaeological Research Section, Florida Department of State, Divi- sion of Archives, History and Records Management (FDAHRM), under the direction of Jill Palmer, com- pleted a 4-week underwater archaeological salvage excavation earlier this spring in the Hillsborough River, Temple Terrace, Florida. The mitigation ef- fort, one of at least 13 in the area, was organized when river bottom sediments were found to contain a heavy scatter of lithic quarry debitage and mastodon remains, suggesting the possibility of a late paleo- Indian/early Archaic kill site. Preliminary analysis has not substantiated the kill site hypothesis, but the lithic material is providing data on an Archaic quarry site, portions of which are not inundated by the fluctuating Hillsborough River. In addition, the frequent occurrences of large land tortoise and mastodon remains are being analyzed for relevant environmental and resource utilization data. Exploratory tests of the Sturdy/Smith cottage site were conducted by Henry Baker (FDAHRM) on In- dian Key, Monroe County, Florida. These tests verified the location of the cottage and reestablished the 1840 street grid on this nineteenth-century island county seat. Information recovered from the excava- tion is being used to relocate interpretive trails on the island. FDAHRM is also continuing salvage operations in the 1-75 right-of-way near Tampa, Florida. Archaic cultures have been but minimally investigated in Florida, and these excavations will aid in the reconstruction of Archaic settlement patterns in the inland Tampa Bay area. Twenty-one Archaic sites and site complexes are being salvaged. Projects in- volving excavation of other Archaic sites are in various stages of completion. Information may be ob- tained from B. Calvin Jones (FDAHRM). In the spring, 1981, Marsha A. Chance completed the excavation of one Middle Archaic site located on the slope adjacent to a sinkhole swamp. The broad range of lithic tool classes and debris recovered suggests a base camp operation. Analysis is being directed toward the in- tersite comparison of three artifact concentrations which were tested, as well as the definition of a cluster (17 m2) isolated within one area of concentra- tion. The spatial distribution of artifact classes within the concentrations is expected to delineate sets of functionally associated tools. Mitigation excavations at the Rock Hammock (8-Hi-556), Tampa Palms (8-Hi-557), and Priscilla (8-Hi-559) sites north of Tampa are being conducted by the 1981 University of South Florida Summer Field School under the direction of J. Raymond Williams, Robert Austin, and Dana Ste. Claire. There were two primary objectives of the project. First, to obtain data pertinent to the problem of classifying the large number of sites in the region which have heretofore been labeled "lithic scatters." Specifically, it was ex- pected that different lithic reduction sequences would characterize different site types. The re- searchers attempted to determine the reduction se- quences represented at each site and compare them with regard to hypothesized site functions. The se- cond objective was to study the variation in the ex- ploitation of different chert types in terms of their availability to prehistoric inhabitants and their func- tional efficiency. Excavations are complete and laboratory analysis is underway. Analysis of data at the Rock Hammock site has revealed a relatively narrow temporal range represented by a predominance of Hernando projec- tile points diagnostic of the Transitional period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 200) and possibly the later Weeden Island period (A.D. 200-1250). Material recovered indi- cates that lithic reduction activities represent all but the very earliest stages of the production sequence (i.e., procurement of raw materials and initial core reduction). Core fragments, blanks, preforms, and nearly completed Hernando points (both whole and broken) were recovered in addition to debitage characteristic of primary, secondary, and tertiary reduction activities. Several discrete areas of lithic concentration characterized by specific chert and flake types were revealed and probably represent in- dividual flint-knapping activities. One definite chip- ping "station" or work area was excavated and mapped in its entirety. Evidence recovered from the site will provide information on the process of stone tool production within a relatively narrow temporal range. During spring, 1981, the University of Florida Ar- cheological Field School was directed by Brenda Sigler-Lavelle (Florida State Museum). Students par- ticipated in the excavation of the Gauthier site (8-Br-193) which is near Lake Poinsett, Brevard County, Florida. This village and cemetery site were occupied from Preceramic Archaic through St. Johns 224 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="24">CURRENT RESEARCH cultural periods. Research issues addressed during this project included: the detailed documentation of the economic base for the successive occupations and techniques of production, and the exogeneous character of resource-fluctuations. These were seen as primary elements to be considered in an explora- tion of economic decision-making processes. First phase sampling evidenced extraordinary pre- servation of floral/faunal material across the site. After systematic sampling of the entire site, excava- tion was concentrated within the village midden. Upon completion of analysis this data base will be used to establish models of sectional economies within coastal lowlands regions. This is seen as a first step toward understanding the effect of economic decisions on the unevenness of sociopoli- tical development within Florida environments. GEORGIA. Under the sponsorship of Interagency Archaeological Services, National Park Service, William H. Marquardt and V. Ann Tippitt (Institute of Archeology and Anthropology, U of South Carolina) directed excavations at Gregg Shoals (9EB259), a deeply stratified site on the Savannah River, from August to October 1980. Preliminary test excavations were undertaken at the nearby Clyde Gulley (9EB387) site in April 1981. The investigation of these sites is part of a long-term study of human adaptation to the forest and riverine resources of the piedmont. Both sites will be inundated by the R. B. Russell Dam and Lake. A three-step plan of coring, precision backhoe testing, and large block excava- tion revealed stratified cultural deposits at Gregg Shoals (3.10 m in depth) including Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, and Early, Middle, and Late Woodland periods. The Early Archaic zone contains by far the greatest density and diversity of artifacts. Excava- tions revealed clear patterns of lithic raw material utilization, with a predominance of coastal plain cherts in the Early Archaic, local quartzes in the Middle Archaic, and quartzes, rhyolites, and argil- lites in the Late Archaic. The Gully site contains horizontally discrete deposits from Early Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. Reports of these in- vestigations are available from the institute. KENTUCKY. Survey efforts by the Kentucky Heritage Commission (now Heritage Division of the Department of the Arts [KHD] ) have focused on McLean and Webster counties in the western coal field region on Kentucky. An additional McLean County survey was performed by Charles D. Hocken- smith during 2 weeks in spring 1981. Efforts in McLean County by Hockensmith, aided part-time by Thomas N. Sanders, resulted in documentation of 72 new sites and the redocumentation of 14 sites (primarily shell mounds) recorded prior to 1940. During the spring and summer of 1981, Hocken- smith also surveyed in Webster County, locating 57 new sites. Additionally, sites were documented in Butler, Caldwell, Crittenden, Hopkins, and Ohio counties, and portions of a major Fort Ancient site (15BK200) were tested in Bracken County. The latter was excavated by the KHD staff and R. Berle Clay, office of the State Archaeologist. MISSISSIPPI. James Lauro, Archaeological Ser- vices, Inc. (ASI), has completed a 344-ha cultural resource survey for the Natchez/Adams County In- dustrial Development Foundation in the loess bluff area of West Mississippi. Twenty-seven sites were recorded, including seven protohistoric and historic Natchez Indian homesteads. Survey work was begun for a 30-ha proposed industrial site along St. Catherine's Creek in Natchez, just south of the vicini- ty of the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians. From December 1980 through February 1981, Mis- sissippi Department of Archives and History, Divi- sion of Historic Preservation (MDAH) archaeologists James Lauro and Geoff Lehmann completed con- trolled surface collections, minimal test excavations, and deep borings at the Slate Site, a Poverty Point lapidary site located in the southeast corner of the Lower Yazoo Basin. A special activity site represent- ing extensive manufacturing of nonutilitarian items of nonindigenous materials, the Slate Site occupies 13 ha in the neck of Wolf Lake, an abandoned chan- nel of the Mississippi River. Items are made of slate, quartz crystals (over 350 have been recovered to date; this is an exceptional amount as most sites con- taining quartz crystals have fewer than a dozen)., horneblende basalt, quartz diorite, bauxite, garnet schist, and phyllite. A high incidence of projectile points are manufactured from novaculite from Arkansas. Preliminary raw material distribution studies indicate a rather extensive trade network reaching throughout most of the Lower Mississippi Valley and beyond. Poverty Point studies in the Yazoo Basin continue with an assessment of private collections made at the Jaketown site in Humphreys County. Geoff Lehmann (MDAH) is principal investigator. The project began in July 1981 and will continue for 1 year. James Lauro has completed the fieldwork for an archaeological assessment of the greater Jackson Metropolitan area. The project aims at assessing the archaeological significance of a major drainage in an urban environment in the hopes of establishing a preliminary chronology for an archaeologically unknown area facing accelerated development. MDAH is carrying out a survey and recording proj- ect of historic Chickasaw sites in Lee County. The project is administered by Patricia Gallaway, and survey and recording work is being carried out by John Stubbs. A preliminary summary of data ob- tained through the project will be available by the end of 1982. MISSOURI. In 1979 Robert C. Dunnell (U of Washington) initiated a systematic surface survey in west-central Dunklin County, Missouri. Fieldwork has been limited to a few weeks in early summer each year to take advantage of local cropping schedules. Research goals are twofold. First, an ef- fort is being made to develop an optimal strategy for surface data recovery. Experimentation has included grid size, techniques of spatial control, methods of calibrating vegetation cover, and the value of an- cillary data sources such as remotely sensed vegeta- tion and soil characteristics and surficial soil chemistry. 225</page><page sequence="25">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Longer range objectives include documentation of the sampling fraction represented by surface ex- posures, collector biases, and effective size limits on recovery. The substantive focus of the research is on spatial patterning with particular attention being given to late Barnes and early Mississippian periods-al- though the Malden Plain is sufficiently ancient that Late Archaic (and more recent materials) are pre- sent on the surface in most locales. Over 4,000 4-m2 collection units have been examined along a natural levee of the Varney River. In this particular environ- ment, Archaic materials are limited to a low, rather uniform frequency of projectile points. Barnes and early Mississippian materials occur as small, dis- crete clusters of ceramics, debitage, and other lithic tools, all a few tens of meters in diameter. This distribution is taken to be indicative of a dispersed settlement pattern. Limited test excavation has demonstrated that the Mississippian clusters are associated with subsurface features which have pro- vided data on subsistence as well as material for car- bon dating. Preliminary analysis suggests that the early Mississippian is similar to, if not identical with, Morse's Big Lake phase in northeastern Arkansas, both in terms of ceramics and age (one C14 date is available at A.D. 840 + 130 [RL-1418] ). Carbonized plant remains include abundant maize as well as quantities of acorns, Carya, and persimmon. Middle and late Mississippian materials are locally absent; Anglo-American homesteads, in most respects similar to the early Mississippian clusters, begin around 1840. NORTH CAROLINA. During spring 1980, and again in spring 1981, Mark A. Mathis, Archeology Branch, North Carolina Division of Archives and History (NCDAH), conducted limited test excavations at over 40 prehistoric sites in the New River Valley in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northwestern North Carolina. The testing (initiated in 1979) is part of a long-term effort to develop a Multiple Resource Na- tional Register Nomination for the New River Valley. Although the majority of the sites being investigated are located in the floodplains, some additional survey and testing is being conducted in the upland areas, along ridgetops, and in saddles to provide a broader view of prehistoric occupation in the New River Valley. Testing indicates that there is a low probabili- ty of deeply stratified sites in the floodplains, with the majority of the identified cultural deposits falling into Late Archaic (Savannah River) and Woodland periods. Up to 25% of the sites tested still contain some undisturbed deposits, with as many as 50% re- taining sub-plowzone features. In 1980-1981, the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs sponsored a survey of a randomly selected sample of Sampson County, North Carolina. The survey was directed by Mark Hackbarth and Dale Hackbarth under an HCRS Survey and Planning grant, administered by the NCDAH. Sampson County is located in the Inner Coastal Plain. The purpose of the survey was to identify and evaluate a statistically valid sample of the sites in the county in order to develop effective predictive models and to relate those models and the archaeology as a whole to the contemporary Indian population in the region. The sampling design for the project involved the iden- tification of latitude/longitude intersections within the county, each of which served as the centerpoint for a 8.1-ha sample unit. In all, 1,453 ha were covered by the survey, which was conducted using a combination of both surface and subsurface tech- niques. A total of 196 prehistoric and historic ar- chaeological sites were recorded. Environmental in- formation was recorded in all of the sample units. This information was then used to develop models of site location which not only attempted to explain why sites tend to occur in specific locations, but also why sites do not occur in others. Specific problems addressed during the investigation included temporal variability in settlement distributions and lithic raw material procurement and utilization. Christopher D. Senior (Catholic U) has completed his analysis and prepared a report, "A Preliminary Analysis of Pisgah Phase Ceramics from the Ward Site, Northwestern North Carolina." Senior's research was conducted at Appalachian State University using collections from five seasons of ar- chaeological investigations at the Ward site, which dates from the Archaic through early historic periods. The primary focus of Senior's research en- tailed analysis of ceramics from the Mississippian stockaded village. The site is the only known prehistoric village in Watuga County and is one of the few villages to be excavated in the mountains of North Carolina. A major goal was to develop a ceramic classification system based on decorative and physical attributes which would serve as a basis for studies of distributional relationships across the village. Ceramics from the Ward site display Pisgah type rims (punctated, collared) and primarily Wood- land type decorative motifs (various types of looped and knotted net fabric impressed). Complicated, stamped varieties comprise a minority of the assemblage. Ward site ceramics are characterized by the presence of coarse to gravel size (.5 mm to greater than 2.0 mm) common-to-abundant aplastic inclusions, primarily quartz, although mica schist is also fairly well represented. It is currently hypothesized that all ceramics were locally manufac- tured; two clay sources have been located but not analyzed. L. Jill Loucks (Appalachian State U) has completed field research under contract to the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation for investigations in the New River Alleghany County Access Area (New River State Park) in extreme northwestern North Carolina. Research goals included an assessment of settlement pattern change and change in resource utilization through time. A total of 11 sites was tested, ranging in occupation dates from middle Ar- chaic through the early twentieth century. Prehis- toric sites included two river floodplain villages, two small cove/creek floodplain villages, one site of con- tinuous horizontal occupation along a ridge and sad- dle system, and four rockshelters. Of three historic sites reportedly within the park boundary, only one was located. The McMillan site consists of house and 226 [Vol. 47, No. 1, 1982]</page><page sequence="26">CURRENT RESEARCH barn foundation ruins dating from the mid-nineteenth century; occupation of the site continued through the early 1920s. Two historic cemeteries were also studied and mapped; the McMillan family cemetery and a possible slave/free Black cemetery. The com- plete use of local, crudely shaped stone markers in the latter and the presence of five similar stones in the McMillan cemetery suggests a link between the two cemeteries. From census data it is known that McMillan owned slaves prior to the Civil War and re- tained Black servants following the war. The Archaeology Branch, NCDAH, in cooperation with the New Bern Preservation Society, sponsored a 5-day salvage excavation of the Haslen-West House in New Bern, Craven County, North Carolina. The property consisted of a much-altered eighteenth- century structure which was located on an original town lot. New Bern, which was settled in 1710, was the colonial and state capital from 1746 until 1792 when Raleigh was established. Although the struc- ture is to be relocated, the proposed development of condominiums would destroy the archaeological com- ponent of the site. The salvage excavation was con- ducted under the direction of John W. Clauser, Jr., assisted by Thomas E. Scheitlin. Preliminary results of the research indicate that the original structure was divided into two areas of specialized use: first as a dwelling/tailor shop, and later as a dwell- ing/cabinet shop. During April 1981, Archaeological Research Con- sultants, Inc. (ARC), of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, conducted a testing phase for the proposed New Bern Main Branch Banking and Trust Company in New Bern, Craven County, North Carolina. Field director for the project was Michael Hartley. ARC's testing phase indicated that there are intact historic deposits which are highly significant for understand- ing the relationships between a seacoast town and its market interior. Fortunately, a May 1769 map drawn by Sauthier, indicating the probable location of most of the colonial period structures, was found to be accurate when the excavation took place. Historical documentation indicated that the wharf area of New Bern had been destroyed by a hurricane on September 7-8, 1769. Excavations revealed that there are intact deposits and features 2 m below the surface. These deposits are capped by a single-event deposition of storm sand that is about 30 cm thick, giving a terminus ante quem of September 8, 1769. Documentation and the Sauthier map indicate that there are no less than 17 structures whose foun- dations and associated features are more than likely intact. Artifacts from the testing phase all indicate a 1760s date for the deposit. In addition, the wetness of the sand deposits has preserved wood and bone. No further work is planned at the site in the near future. The reactivation of the Fayetteville Central Business District Loop project in Cumberland County by the North Carolina Department of Transportation initiated a retesting of that portion of the remains of the Fayetteville Arsenal within the proposed right-of- way. John Clauser, Jr., assisted by Thomas Scheitlin (both NCDAH), directed the work in November 1980. Although considerable research had been conducted on the site in the past, additional testing was recom- mended due to the historic significance of the Arsenal, which was constructed in 1838 and destroyed by Sherman's troops in 1865. Previous ex- cavations had exposed remains of the major struc- tures within the right-of-way. The interiors of these structures were tested to determine the presence of intact remains as an aid in the planning of additional salvage work. Evidence recovered related to the destruction sequence of the Arsenal, which consisted of burning and subsequent demolition of the remain- ing standing walls into the interiors of the structures. The intact remains still present within both the main arsenal building and the barracks show architec- tural details and suggest certain inaccuracies in the written record regarding building size and use. SOUTH CAROLINA. Recent research by the University of South Carolina Institute of Archeology and Anthropology (USC) into Middle-Late Woodland and Mississippian settlement-subsistence change has been reported in a draft (1981) entitled, "Modeling Subsistence Change in the Late Prehistoric Period in the Interior Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina," edited by Mark J. Brooks and Veletta Canouts. The study has modified substantially the traditional models of late prehistoric, coastal-interior, late fall transhumance patterns. The archaeological, ethno- historical, and environmental-ecological data suggest that the interior Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina was exploited on a year-round basis by Middle-Late Woodland and Mississippian popula- tions. Differences in the subsistence strategies be- tween the two groups were characterized by a series of interrelated hypotheses deduced from economic- ecological theory. The hypotheses were examined us- ing paleoecological data and archaeological measures of functional variability in the artifact assemblages. Using archaeological and geological sea-level in- dicators, Mark J. Brooks (USC), Donald J. Colquhoun (Department of Geology, USC), James L. Michie (USC), Larry Lepionka (USC), Walter S. Newman (Queens College Radiocarbon Laboratory, City University of New York), and Frank W. Stapor (Exxon Research and Development, Houston, Texas) continue to develop a Holocene Sea Level curve for the south- eastern United States, emphasizing the South Carolina coast. Present data indicate a series of 1-2-m fluctuations in sea level at 400-600-year inter- vals during the last 6,000 radiocarbon years. These changes appear to have occurred against a general background of very slowly rising sea level with major transgressions near 4,000, 3,000, and 2,100 radio- carbon years before present. At least two major regressions occurred at 3,100 and 2,300 radiocarbon years before present. Coincident with the 4,000-year date are: (1) the first general appearance of coastal-estuarine shell middens; (2) a transition from a Late Archaic to Early Woodland adaptation(s) along the estuaries and river valleys of the coastal plain; and, (3) the development of early beach ridges now associated with the ex- isting barrier islands on the South Carolina coast. 227</page><page sequence="27">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Preliminary evidence also suggests that extensive floodplains began to form along the Piedmont- draining rivers of the coastal plain at about 4,000 radiocarbon years B.P. A third field season on the Santa Elena Project at Parris Island began June 1, 1981. This is a part of the major Sixteenth-Century Research Program initiated in 1979 by Stanley South and Robert Stephenson as a long-range research program of the Institute of Ar- cheology and Anthropology, University of South Carolina. The National Geographic Society has fund- ed the work, which is directed by South. Santa Elena, located at the tip of Parris Island in Beaufort County, was established by Pedro Men6ndez de Avile6s as a Spanish colony in 1566. It was the capital of Spanish Florida before Saint Augustine rose to that prominence following the abandonment of Santa Elena in 1587. The settlement was protected by Fort San Felipe from 1566-1570 when Indians burned the town and the Spanish evacuated it. The next year they returned, rebuilt the town, and built Fort San Marcos. Santa Elena had a population ranging up to 400 Spanish residents, in- cluding farmers and their families as well as the military garrison. In July 1979, the outline of Fort San Felipe was identified and the town adjacent to it was located. That fall the town was tested, a small building was excavated, and tests were put in Fort San Felipe and Fort San Marcos. The latter fort, misidentified as the French establishment of Charlesforte, had been part- ly excavated by Major Osterhout of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1923. In 1981 a large excavation near the center of San- ta Elena revealed the remains of at least three more buildings; one comprised a large structure almost 9 m on a side. A barrel well identified in 1979 was ex- cavated. Artifacts recovered include two coins of the period, abundant Spanish majolica ceramics, olive jar fragments, Indian ceramics from the local area as well as from Georgia and Florida, Mexican ceramics, Oriental procelain, large Spanish nails, corn with the kernels still on the cobs, a small Maltese cross with crucifix attached, and numerous other metal and ceramic objects. Since the site excavated in 1923 turned out to be Fort San Marcos (of 1571), instead of the French Huguenot site of Charlesforte, the search for the location of Charlesforte continues. Stanley South, funded by a grant from the Explorer's Club of New York, will spend August testing locations on Port Royal Island where Charlesforte may be located. TENNESSEE. Archaeological research within the Tellico Reservoir area on the Little Tennessee River in southeast Tennessee has continued uninter- rupted since the inundation of Tellico Lake in late 1979. Primary emphasis has been placed upon ex- amining extinct settlement systems from a probabil- ity-based, regional perspective. Research is being undertaken by the Department of Anthropology, University of Tennessee (R. P. Stephen Davis, Jr., Larry R. Kimball, William Baden, and Jefferson Chapman, Principal Investigator), and is funded by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Analysis is oriented toward the recognition of functionally and temporal- ly specific surface assemblages and is designed to produce a testable model of aboriginal settlement for the 9,000 years of continuous occupation in the valley. Because this model is based solely upon sur- face collections (primarily lithic artifacts but also a minor quantity of ceramic artifacts), it is considered to be a first approximation. Data generated from the 13 years of previous investigations in Tellico, in- cluding over 15 major excavations of stratified Early Archaic to historic Overhill Cherokee sites, are being used extensively to develop temporal recognition models for artifacts and artifact assemblages, and behavioral models for understanding the implica- tions of artifact covariability among surface assemblages. In addition, certain excavated site data are being used to model the relationship of surface assemblages or subsurface plowzone, midden, and feature assemblages. Probabilistic survey within Tellico was initiated during fall 1979, just prior to inundation, and was completed in the fall 1981. Three phases of sampling were employed. The results, when combined and poststratified, provide a sizable data base for study- ing riverine and upland exploitation along a 52-km segment of the lower Little Tennessee River Valley. Over the last 2 years a number of papers and reports relating to this project have been produced. Detailed information may be obtained from Jefferson Chap- man. Reports completed in the past year pertaining to previous excavations in the Tellico Reservoir are "Tomotley, an Eighteenth Century Overhill Cherokee Village," by William Baden; "The Bacon Bend and Iddins sites: The Late Archaic Period in the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley," by Jefferson Chap- man; and "The Archeobotanical Record: Early Ar- chaic Period to Contact in the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley," by Chapman and Andrea Brewer Shea. In April 1981, a 2-year research program under the direction of Robert Mainfort (Tennessee Depart- ment of Conservation "TDC") was begun at Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Area, near Jackson, Tennessee. The site consists of approximately 24 mounds, a circular earthwork, and associated village areas. The overall research objective for the project is to determine the temporal and cultural affiliations of a number of the mounds. During the summer 1981 two mounds were investigated by the state crew, with assistance from a field school that was jointly sponsored by TDC and Memphis State University. Test excavations on top of Mound 5, a ramped mound about 9 m high, revealed an association of sand- tempered and sand/grog-tempered ceramics with the uppermost occupation levels. Mound 31, a small Mid- dle Woodland burial mound, yielded the remains of an extended adult in a submound pit. Surrounding most of the pit on the level of the mound floor was a C-shaped ring of cremations capped with red clay. In- vestigation of several occupation areas will begin in spring 1982. Jerald T. Milanich 228 [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982]</page><page sequence="28">CURRENT RESEARCH CALIFORNIA AND GREAT BASIN Recent research projects have run the gamut from studies of historical California Mission archaeology and excavations at an ethnohistoric Chumash site, to an iconographic study of rock alignments in the Cali- fornia Desert and investigations into the paleo-Indian and early Archaic periods at a time period of 10,000 B.P. and more. Several projects investigated Great Basin desert adaptations-both Archaic and horti- cultural. Survey work done in connection with the MX Missile project occupied several field teams, and obsidian distribution studies using x-ray fluoresence and PIXE techniques were continued. CALIFORNIA. Paul E. Nesbitt, State Department of Parks and Recreation, reports preliminary find- ings of the Rancho Olompali investigations in ethno- graphic Miwok territory. Breck Parkman has identi- fied the existence of pit-and-groove cupule boulders at an apparently early date (6000-2000 B.C. is sug- gested) followed by evidence of bedrock mortar use (from 2000 B.C.-A.D. 300). In one case a mortar was ground through an earlier cupule. Olompali, ap- parently a regional center for the ethnographic Miwok, has also figured recently in the ongoing con- troversy about Sir Francis Drake's landing place; an English sixpence, minted at the Tower of London, 1567, was excavated there by Charles Slaymaker. California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, completed its sixth year of excavations at Mission San Antonio de Padua (1771-1834) in Monterey County, California, under the direction of Robert L. Hoover. Excavations in the Soldiers' Bar- racks revealed two superimposed levels of construc- tion, one from 1776 and one from 1802. The earlier component contained many sherds of colonial Mex- ican majolica and lead-glazed wares, some Chinese porcelain, and some native Mexican Indian wares. The assemblage indicates a strong Spanish colonial trading network in the later eighteenth century and provides clues as to the origins of the soldiers' native wives. The 1802 ceramic assemblage consists primarily of English transfer prints and locally made Mission Ware, indicating the dominance of Anglo trading activities in early nineteenth-century Cali- fornia and the subsequent development of a local pot- tery industry at the Mission itself. The armory con- tained many musket balls, English gunflints, and a Miguelet flintlock mechanism. The abundance of these artifacts indicates the greater reliability of maritime supply in Spanish California, as compared to the tenuous overland trade into the Spanish South- west-where the military was sometimes forced to rely on the use of bows and arrows for defense against the Apache. A trench associated with the 1776 component contained an aqueduct lined on both sides with ladrillos and floored with slabs of shale. The feature dates to ca. 1780, when the earliest fired tiles were used at San Antonio. It may represent the earliest colonial water channel excavated in Spanish California. Robert R. Cartier reports that excavations con- ducted in 1980 and 1981 at CA-SCr-177 in Scott's Valley, near Santa Cruz, yielded C-14 dates of 7,180 ? 290 (RL-1374) and 10,080 ? 460 B.P. (RL-1373) on charcoal from two test units. The dates were associated with chert dart points, a large chert biface, obsidian flakes, charcoal, fire-altered rock, and ground stone artifacts. A similar collection was recovered at CA-SCr-244, some 400 m distant. These dates are congruent with a determination of 9960 ? 500 B.P. (UCLA 2329D) reported by the firm of ERA at CA-SC1-175, some 45 km to the east. These early dates compare well with the 7000-10,000 B.P. dates previously established farther inland at CA-Ker-116 and CA-Lak-380 for the "lower archaic." George A. Teague, Western Archeological and Conservation Center, reports NPS investigations in Wawona and El Portal, Yosemite National Park. John Whittaker investigated six sites in the Wawona Valley at the South end of Yosemite. Historic material included a dump and a slaughterhouse with associated bone dump belonging to the Wawona Hotel which was built in the 1850s to 1870s. Three sites, 4-Mrp-170, 4-Mrp-343, and 4-Mrp-8, had prehistoric components, representing both the Mariposa and Crane Flat complexes. Obsidian tools and over 10,000 pieces of debitage were analyzed, revealing that a major activity was the working of large obsidian bifaces. Small projectile points and scrapers were made on the waste flakes of biface manufacture, but the larger bifaces themselves were not found at the Wawona sites. They were presum- ably traded to the west where such specimens can be found in contemporary sites. The obsidian was prob- ably obtained by trade from the Owens Valley region; source analysis and obsidian hydration studies are still in progress. At El Portal, test excavations by Scott Carpenter at 4-Mrp-182 and 4-Mrp-250 are of special interest because of the depth of the sites, long cultural sequences extending from the Crane Flat period to ethnohistoric times, and good preser- vation of charcoal, bone, seeds, and charred nuts. At 4-Mrp-250, an ethnohistoric Miwok house floor with a hearth and ash pit has been partially uncovered. The final analysis will allow comparison of the El Portal site, located in the Upper Sonoran region and ethnohistorically occupied year-round, with the higher elevation, probably seasonal Wawona sites. A soil sedimentation analysis is underway to determine the processes which formed the middens. In 1980-1981 Michael J. Moratto (INFOTEC Develop- ment Inc.) directed an intensive survey of 27,303 ha on the Stanislaus National Forest, central Sierra Nevada, California, during which 188 aboriginal sites were located. Deep middens and bedrock mor- tar concentrations represent large villages at eleva- tions below snowline (- 1000 m), while lithic scatters mark warm-season camps in the higher mountains. Artifacts reflect Great Basin influence over a span of about 4,000 years. Moratto also has been Principal Investigator of the New Melones project, Phase X, conducted by INFOTEC for the National Park Service in the central Sierra Nevada. Holocene environmental and cultural changes were investigated at two sites. One of these, 04-Cal-S-286, contained several cultural strata, the lowest (as yet undated) being a compacted yellow 229</page><page sequence="29">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY clay (- 100-190 cm) with cores and distinctive large percussion-flaked bifaces and scrapers. Above the clay was a midden deposit including two components: one ascribable to the prehistoric Miwok and one used in the late nineteenth century by native Americans for mortuary purposes. Historical archaeologists directed by Co-Principal Investigator Roberta Greenwood in 1981 excavated eight New Melones sites selected for their potential yield of information about early habitation in placer mining areas, relationships between historic groups and the effective environment, and activities of iden- tified ethnic populations. Excavations were preceded by an active program of historical research. Green- wood and Moratto, along with Co-Principal Investi- gator William Singleton and a large staff, are prepar- ing the final report on the New Melones project. Moratto and Lynn Riley (1980) and Moratto and Steven O'Brien (1981) have also tested nine high-ele- vation (- 1980 m) sites near Balsam Meadow, east- ern Fresno County, California, on behalf of Southern California Edison Company. Artifacts indicate 3,000-5,000 years of seasonal occupation of high meadows as well as considerable trans-Sierran trade in obsidian. Chester King reports test excavations carried out during the winter of 1980-1981 at Talepop (Ca-LAn-229), a prehistoric and historic (ca. A.D. 1100-1830) Chumash village located in the Santa Monica Mountains. The project, carried out under contract with the California Department of Parks and Recreation, was necessitated by planned road construction at Malibu Creek State Park. Three discrete residential areas with associated outdoor food processing and projectile point manufacturing areas were distinguished. The largest of these areas was inhabited throughout the life of the village; the other two were first occupied around A.D. 1600. Preliminary data indicate that these smaller areas may have been occupied by migrants entering the Chumash territory. The entire site appears to have been abandoned in 1805 due to missionization, but was reoccupied between 1810 and 1825 by a small group of Chumash affiliated with the San Fernando Mission. A hearth which dates to this period yielded large amounts of burned historic beads and food re- mains including beans, corn, wheat or barley, acorns, and bones of cattle and possibly other domesticated animals. Flotation of all excavated soil recovered a massive quantity of charred plant re- mains. In addition to the species already mentioned, these include nut fragments of walnut and Islay (Prunus illicifolia), berries and seeds of manzanita (Arctostaphylos sp.), bulb and yucca fragments, wood fragments, and small seeds from sage (Salvia sp.), grasses and numerous other herbaceous plants. Fish remains recovered from the 3-mm mesh screens have provided the first substantive evidence that sar- dines were an important part of the Chumash diet. Emma Lou Davis reports that the Great Basin Foundation has been engaged in making aerial photographs of huge rock alignments in a pluvial lake basin of the southern California desert. It is speculated that the alignments relate to water con- trol at a now-dry lake, and to the spirit protection of the hunter-gatherers who made them. The figures discerned are said to display astonishing iconographic variety, and a plan is being formulated for continuing interdisciplinary geoarchaeological research in the area. NEVADA. Richard C. Hanes, Nevada BLM, reports several projects funded wholly or in part by the Bureau. A major excavation at Hidden Cave, Churchill County, Nevada, by David Hurst Thomas was com- pleted during the summer of 1981. The project was supported by the American Museum of Natural History, Bureau of Land Management and the Nevada Division of Historic Preservation and Ar- cheology. Peter J. Mehringer, Washington State University, has completed a coprolite analysis and pollen profile. Donald K. Grayson, University of Washington, has nearly completed an analysis of the faunal remains. Jonathan 0. Davis, Desert Research Institute, has completed an analysis of the sediments and a stratigraphic profile. Analysis of the material culture continues, including a reanalysis of earlier excavated materials stored at the Lowie and Nevada State museums. Cultural use of the cave was ap- parently restricted to an approximately 2,000-year period characterized primarily by Gatecliff series projectile points. Fifteen radiocarbon assays are now available, ranging from 17,580 + 240 B.P. (WSU2455 B) to 15,130 ? 400 B.P. (L-289AA) for the basal noncultural oolitic tufa deposits and from 5000 to 3000 B.P. for the "32 Inch Midden" deposits originally described by Roust and Grosscup in 1956. Nancy Botti, Carson City BLM, discovered a large cache of obsidian bifaces during a project survey in Smith Valley; systematic excavation yielded 37 specimens. These specimens, in addition to bifaces found recently in two other caches in western Nevada, are being analyzed by Richard C. Hanes. Two projects were recently conducted by C. Wil- liam Clewlow, Jr. Systematic surface collections and test excavations were executed at the Bird Spring Site, Clark County, in early 1980. Located only 32 km southwest of Las Vegas, the site, recorded in 1930, consists of five roasting pits, an associated small rockshelter, and a large, open midden with a high density of cultural material, including numerous complete stone tools, much faunal material, and six major groups of pottery. The site was apparently utilized coevally by Southern Paiute and Pueblo peoples for an undetermined length of time; in addi- tion, Lower Colorado Buffware indicates either tem- porary use by, or trade with, Yuman peoples. Radio- carbon and pollen samples were collected for further analysis. Excavations at Summit Twin Springs, Hum- boldt County, were conducted later in 1980. Abun- dant and varied artifacts were recovered throughout a deposit almost 1.5 m deep in this large open site, located at an elevation of 8,200 feet. A wide range of tasks was apparently performed at the site between about 4000 B.C. and A.D. 500. A joint crew from the American Museum of Natural History and Desert Research Institute, Reno, [Vol. 47, No. 1,1982] 230</page><page sequence="30">CURRENT RESEARCH under the direction of Lorann S. A. Pendleton, con- ducted a field survey and collected artifacts asso- ciated with a prehistoric antelope drift fence near Fort Sage Mountain, Washoe County. Gatecliff series and Rosegate series projectile points indicate possi- ble use of the site between about 2500 B.C. and A.D. 1100. An overview of the prehistoric and historic cultural resources of the Carson City BLM District is being conducted by the American Museum of Natural History under the direction of Lorann S. A. Pendleton. Similar efforts have been completed for eastern Nevada under the direction of Dennett, Muessig, and Associates of Iowa City. Richard E. Hughes, University of California, Davis, is completing major, minor, and trace element analyses of obsidian from sources in northeastern California, southern Oregon, and northwestern Nevada in conjunction with a study of prehistoric ac- quisition and exchange relationships in the area. Trace element concentrations (in ppm) in obsidian from parent geological sources are being matched with those generated from artifacts using nonde- structive x-ray fluorescence and, where appropriate, PIXE techniques. Major archaeological collections sampled include: Kawumkan Springs and Nightfire Island in the Klamath Lakes area; Iron Gate and other sites in the Salt Cave locality along the Klamath River; the Burrell site (CA-Mod-293) and CA-Mod-301 in the Goose Lake Basin; the Menlo Baths (CA-Mod-197), King's Dog (CA-Mod-204), Rodriguez (CA-Las-194) and Bare Cave (CA-Las-202) sites in Surprise Valley; the Karlo site (CA-Las-7) in Secret Valley; the Lorenzen site (CA-Mod-250) near Fall River Mills; and the Squaw Creek site (CA-Sha-475) near Redding. Results de- rived from analysis of time marker projectile points document differences in obsidian source use through time. In some localities, this temporal variability reflects a distinction between arrow points and dart points. Ertec Inc. carried out several surveys in Nevada and Utah during 1980 and 1981 as part of the en- vironmental studies for the MX Missile system. In Dry Lake Valley a total of 1,920 ha were examined and 139 cultural resources sites recorded. The pre- historic finds included 74 isolated artifacts, 42 lithic scatters, 4 milling stations, 11 temporary camps, and 1 complex of temporary camps along a playa edge. These sites indicate occupation of the valley by at least 5,000 B.P. and contain evidence of Fremont oc- cupation. Historic finds consisted of three isolated artifacts, one campsite, and three section corner markers. There were 700 ha surveyed in Pine Valley and 679 ha in Wah Wah Valley. The Pine Valley survey resulted in the discovery of 32 cultural resource sites. Of the 23 prehistoric finds, 20 were isolated ar- tifacts and 4 were lithic scatters. These sites indicate that the valley was used from the early Archaic through the Shoshone periods. Historic artifacts in- cluded seven isolated artifacts and one section cor- ner marker. In Wah Wah Valley 59 cultural resources sites were recorded. The prehistoric finds included 38 isolated artifacts, 10 lithic scatters, 2 milling stations, and 1 temporary campsite. These sites provide evidence for more extensive use of Wah Wah Valley than was expected. Occupation included the Archaic and may include Fremont and Shoshone. Historic sites consisted of six isolated artifacts and three campsites. UTAH. During the summers of 1980 and 1981 the University of Utah Archeological field school, sup- ported by the United States Forest Service, continued its excavation program at Nawthis Village, a Fre- mont habitation site near Salina, occupied between A.D. 900-1100. Structures investigated by J. F. O'Connell and K. T. Jones included a burned rec- tangular pit house, a rectangular, single room adobe surface structure, and a large adobe structure. Asso- ciated artifacts included Sevier Grey, Emery Grey, and Ivie Creek B/W ceramics; and Bull Creek, Nawthis Side Notched, Cottonwood Triangular, and Uinta Side Notched projectile points. Preliminary analysis indicates that two separate household groups are represented, one marked by the pit house and small adobe surface structure, the other by the large adobe. There is no evidence of specialized ac- tivity areas or secondary midden deposits associated with any of the structures. During the 1981 season Jones and D. Metcalfe sought to estimate the number of structures present in the central part of the site, a 60 x 150-m area con- taining at least eight shallow circular depressions and twelve mounds, the largest more than 2 m high. They mapped a 40 x 70-m area with a proton mag- netometer, then dug a series of test trenches to ex- plore the relationship between the configuration of the modern ground surface, magnetic anomalies, and cultural features. Preliminary results suggest that there may be many more pit houses present than the number of surface depressions would indicate. In ad- dition, Jones and Metcalfe cleared large parts of at least four rectangular pithouses and partly exposed a very large surface adobe, measuring 6 m on a side and containing more than eight separate rooms. Walls remain standing as high as 1.7 m. During 1980 and 1981 the University of Utah Ar- cheological Center worked on MX missile contracts under the direction of Richard N. Holmer and Joel C. Janetski. These involved systematic surveys of areas ranging from sand dunes in valley bottoms to the ponderosa pine zone on mountain peaks and provided the first systematic archaeological sample of a wide range of environments common to the southeastern Great Basin. Preliminary analysis of the data demon- strates strong environmental correlates with site distribution: Projectile points of the western Pluvial Lakes Tradition and Archaic commonly occur in valley bottom sand dunes; Archaic, Fremont, and Paiute remains occur near the Pinyon/sage ecotone; and Archaic and Fremont artifacts in the high moun- tains. Over the past 3 years the Archeological Center has developed a computerized site record system under the direction of R. Holmer and Alan S. Lichty. The ARI System (Archeological Resource Inventory Sys- 231</page><page sequence="31">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tern) consists of two integral parts: a data file of 13,000 known sites in Utah and eastern Nevada con- taining detailed information on over 100 site at- tributes; and approximately 25 totally interactive programs that allow rapid data entry, verification that all variables are reasonable, several options on site data listings, selection of sites by locational and cultural parameters, and numerous CRT/pen/dot- matrix plotting options. An important aspect of the system is its ability to interface with commercially available statistical and plotting packages, allowing a wide range of users to efficiently address the data. The ARISystem data base is designed to be com- patible with other systems and computers and is cur- rently shared with the BLM, Forest Service, and Utah Division of State History. The system also inter- faces with the museum collections system currently being developed by the Utah Museum of Natural History. IDAHO. The Idaho State University Archeology Field school continued excavations at the Double- springs site (10CR29) in the Lost River Range, east- central Idaho. Excavations during the 1980 season under the direction of Mark Druss, Max Dahlstrom, and Jim Woods recovered Clovis, Folsom, Haskett, Northern Side Notched, Pinto, Elko, Eastgate, Cotton- wood, Desert Side Notched and possible Humboldt projectile points. Fieldwork during the 1981 season, under the direction of Druss and Steve Wright, recovered additional material including several grinding-stone fragments and possibly a hearth. All of this material seems to be associated with a large, unfluted Clovis knife or preform recovered during the 1980 season. C.
