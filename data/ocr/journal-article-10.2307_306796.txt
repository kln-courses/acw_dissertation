Miinchen: Otto Sagner, 1968. 549 pp. Dagmar Burkhart's work, written as a Ph.D. dissertation under Alois Schmaus's guidance, is an important contribution to the study of the South Slavic heroic epic. Con- trary to the majority of the former scholars who have studied mainly the songs of the Dinarian area as represented in Vuk Karad'i6's collections, Burkhart has concentrated on the songs in the Macedonian and West Bulgarian region. The Macedonian-West Bulgarian songs are, according to her, the most archaic in the entire South Slavic area, being characterized by primitive and mythological traits. Burkhart's study is devoted primarily to two central themes of heroic poetry: the dragon fight and heroic wooing. While 2irmunskij had considered the dragon fight theme "a new motif" in the South Slavic epic, Burkhart shows that it belongs to the oldest layer of the Macedonian and West Bulgarian epic and is genetically connected with the same theme among the Greeks. From the dragon fight songs Burkhart derives the songs about vila brodarica, Bolen Dojain, and the black Arab (crni Arapin). She shows how the figure of the dragon gradually lost its mythological features and de- veloped into the vila, the black Arab, the hajduk, the Turk, the Tatar, and finally even into the waitress of the inn. However, all the latter characters have retained some typical dragon traits that betray their ultimate origin. The process of historicization that resulted in the metamorphosis of the dragon also caused the replacement of the originally nameless, archaic-primitive dragon fighter by some local hero (Marko, Relja, Momailo, and others). The other central theme of the South Slavic epic, the heroic wooing, with its characteristic courtship tasks, is shown as belonging to the secondary layer in Mace- donia and West Bulgaria. These songs have been received partly from Serbia and Croatia and partly from Greece. Burkhart deals also with other themes of Macedonian-West Bulgarian folklore, such as the fight against supernatural anthropomorphic enemies: Musa Kesed'ija with his several hearts, the yellow Jew with a body partly or entirely of stone, and the giant girl Arvatka. She analyzes in detail the Hungarian (which she calls "Ugric") heroes and themes in the Macedonian-West Bulgarian epic. Her final conclusion is that while the Macedonian-West Bulgarian epic songs are the most ancient among the South Slavs, those in the Croatian shore areas and especially in the islands are second to them in age. The so-called "classical" heroic songs of the Dinarian region are the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 251 youngest; they are completely demythologized, historicized, and psychologized. Because of their esthetic quality and their connection with historical events and persons, the Dinarian songs have overshadowed the more archaic Macedonian-West Bulgarian and Croatian coastal songs. The author has studied not only the South Slavic (Yugoslav and Bulgarian) heroic epic, but also the epic of neighboring Greece, Albania, Hungary, and Rumania. She follows the migration of the song plots or individual motifs from one country to another. Likewise, she gives due attention to the mythological beings in the songs (such as zmaj, lamja, krstnik, vila, zduhac, and others) and their models or counterparts in the folklore of the neighboring nations. Following Schmaus's suggestion, Burkhart has done a "microscopic study" of all the variants of the songs available. She has not classified the variants into types and subtypes, but has presented them in the order of their degree of originality. The full discussion of each variant results in much repetition. To prevent the reader's getting lost in the jungle of details, a summary of all the differing traits appearing in the variants would have been useful. The presentation of lengthy resumes of the songs from Petranovid's collections (356-357, 393-394, 403-404) is unnecessary, since- because the songs are termed to be individual creations of the singer-they are entirely discarded in the ensuing discussion. Conclusions are presented succinctly at the end of each chapter. Sometimes the conclusions are even given twice, at the beginning of the chapter, before starting the discussion (e.g., 118, 170, 234), and at the end of it. The general conclusions drawn in the work are given at the beginning of the book (pp. 43ff.) and formulated once more, in greater detail, at the close of it. The author is most familiar with the literature on the problems discussed, including that published in the West. Only very few works can be added to her bibliography, such as Maja Bo'kovi&amp;-Stulli's study of krsnik, kresnik, etc. in Fabula, III (1966), Vi'nja Huzjak's study Zeleni Juraj (Zagreb, 1957), and N. Bana'evid's article on the names of vila in SAN, Zbornik radova, XVII (1952). Burkhart shares the opinion of I. ,Simanov that the deseterac is secondary in the Macedonian-West Bulgarian area, having developed from an original 8-syllable verse, with the addition of 2-syllable filling words (36-39). This solution cannot be recon- ciled with the evidence presented by Roman Jakobson concerning the Primitive Slavic (and, ultimately, Indo-European) origin of the Yugoslav and Russian decasyllable. Dagmar Burkhart's Untersuchungen is a valuable study of the South Slavic heroic epic. It sets up and characterizes the different strata of the epic songs, discusses their interrelationship and their transformations in the course of history. It has its place among the fine contributions made to South Slavic folklore by such Western scholars as Albert Lord, Alois Schmaus, Maximilian Braun, and Karl-Heinz Pollok. Felix f.
