Helsinki: Suomen Historiallinen Seura, 1988. 320 pp. This Suomalaiset, English language outo Pohjolan edition kansa of Professor might better Kemiläinen's be titled "Race 1993 Theories, volume Suomalaiset, outo Pohjolan kansa might better be titled "Race Theories, National Consciousness, and the Origins of the Finns." Kemiläinen achieves three important tasks in this book: she presents a succinct summary of racial theories from the eighteenth century to the present and explains how these were applied to the peoples of Finland; she weaves into this story the findings of her earlier research on the origins of Finnish national consciousness; and she provides a useful synopsis of recent archeological, genetic, and linguistic research on the settlement of Finland. The result is a remarkably interdisciplinary volume of considerable use to students and scholars alike. This richly illustrated volume, organized into fifteen chapters (in addition to a bibliography, appendices, and an index), traces how scholars and literary figures have answered the familiar question, "Are Finns European or Asian in origin?" Kemiläinen argues that the early Enlightenment race theories that gave birth to the field of Anthropology identified Finns variously as Caucasian or as Mongoloid. She holds that these early race theories were not racist, although</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 273 they did differentiate between the "beautiful" characteristics of Europeans and the "ugliness" of non-Europeans. By the mid- 1800s the thesis that Finns were descendants of the Mongols and belief that this could be proven both linguistically (the supposed link between Mongolian and the Finno-Ugric languages) and physiologically (the supposed Mongolian features of the "real" Finns) dominated the views of scholars and literati outside Finland. The idea that Finns were dark Mongols (or Turanians) was so widespread that foreign visitors to Finland were usually surprised to find blond Finns. Most Finns themselves accepted the theory, and many Fennomans in particular celebrated the Finns' supposed non-Caucasian roots. Kemiläinen carefully walks the reader through an often dizzying maze of early anthropological (and pseudo-anthropological) debates before coming to the work of Gobineau and the mid-nineteenth century origins of modern racism. She briefly outlines main tenants of Aryan race theories with their rhetoric of racial superiority, and argues that these "shook" the Finns into reconsidering their own racial origins. Many Swedes and Swedish speakers in Finland rallied to the idea of Germanic Aryan racial superiority, and defined the Finns as backwards, uncivilized, Asiatic inferiors. Kemiläinen stresses the importance of Swedish racism against the Finns, which came at a time when Finns were becoming increasingly well-educated, as a factor in the origins of Finnish national consciousness and then in the Fennoman movement. By the late 1800s, members of the Swedish-speaking Svekoman movement who feared that their elite status was threatened by the Finnish speaking minority, defined Finland as a country with two races - the superior culture creating Nordic Aryans and the backward, herd-like Finns. The Fennoman movement, in contrast, argued that Finland had two languages but only one people - the Finns. Swedish-speakers' arguments about Finnish racial inferiority even extended to their explanations of the 1918 Civil War, which they blamed on the culturally retarded "asiatic" Reds. In the meantime, the advance of scientific methods of anthropology began raising problems with the theory of Mongol origins. Kemiläinen describes a long series of observational studies circa 1910 that investigated the hair colour, cranial measurements, and other physical characteristics of the inhabitants of Finland's various districts. These shattered earlier assumptions about the existence of two races in Finland - the characteristics of Swedish speakers did not differ dramatically from those of Finnish speakers. Comparisons of the characteristics of Finns and Mongols also shook the hold of the Mongol origins thesis, at the same time that anthropologists began questioning the linkage between language and race. Between the 1920s and the 1960s a new theory of Finnish racial origins emerged: Finns were reportedly derived from an Eastern Baltic race that had mixed with German and Nordic tribes. This new theory fed into political debates over language policy in the newly independent Finland, and between the wars the idea that Finns might be descendants of the Mongols rather than Germans was employed as a racial insult. Kemiläinen gives remarkably slight coverage (five pages) to Nazi theories regarding the Finns, and moves quickly to the 1950s, when the idea that Finns were an East Baltic-</page><page sequence="3">274 Journal of Baltic Studies Nordic mix became dominant among anthropologists. Kemiläinen seems to see the twentieth century as a steady movement away from theories of racial superiority - and indeed, the death of the anthropological concept of race. The last chapters are devoted to contemporary archeological, genetic, and linguistic findings. Anthropomorphic, blood group, and linguistic studies have demolished theories of the Finns' East-Baltic and Siberian origins. A major Finnish interdisciplinary project published in 1984 demonstrated that Finns are a mixture of pre-Indo-European "aboriginal" peoples and various Indo-European groups that began migrating to Finland in about 2500 B.C. Ancient Finland was home to many different cultures, some of which existed simultaneously. Major genetic studies in the 1990s have demonstrated that Finns are genetically Europeans, with far stronger genetic links to European populations than to any Asiatic peoples. Kemiläinen devotes considerable attention to the 1994 findings of Cavalli-Sforza, et. al. ( The History and Geography of Human Genes), although she criticizes some of that study's assumptions concerning Finns. Cavalli-Sforza determined that Finns were genetically European, but argued on linguistic grounds that they derived from Asia - thus returning us to a theory of Mongol origins that has been disproved by archeological and linguistic research. Using the research of Päivi Lahermo on mitochondrial and Y chromosomes in Finnish populations, Kemiläinen argues that there were at least two major waves of "european" migratory settlements in Finland before the influx of Indo- Europeans. The ancestors of the Finns, she deduces, were more likely inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula than of the great Central Asian Steppe. Kemiläinen concludes that racially derogatory views of the Finns reinforced their self-conception as a peripheral people, but that despite this racism the Finns have gone on to become one of Europe's most advanced peoples. This book will serve as a useful supplement to any introduction to Finnish history and society. Readers must, of course, bear in mind that like the many studies of race that Kemiläinen discusses in her text, the book reflects the politics and biases of its own time. Kemiläinen treats the positions that Finnish radicals took on the race question in the 1960s and 1970s and Finland's modern relationship with Russia in a similarly dismissive, offhand manner. Moreover, she is silent on the Finnish response to Nazi race theory and on contemporary Finnish attitudes towards race. Her portrayal of the history of race theory and anthropology gives the misleading impression that Nazi racial theories were an anomalous throwback to the mid- 1800s. These objections aside, Kemiläinen has done us a great service by making her remarkable synthesis available in English. MICHAEL C. HICKEY Bloomsburg University</page></plain_text>
