In contesting past assumptions , it displays an obsession with the inadequacy of language and once again truth is the first casualty in this battle of texts and contexts. Dismissive and disputatious of all the notions of meaning and truth, postmodernism poses a challenge to all religious orientations which uphold these notions earnestly. It has replaced ontology with a scientistic and analytic epistemology which has been proved fatal for most of the notions of truth and reality as in this epistemology the individual Cartesian consciousness of the thinking subject is taken to be the source of all reality and truth. The analytic philosophy and Derrida's deconstruction have worked hand in glove with postmodernism to undermine the notion of truth. The present paper attempts to show the problematic nature of these philosophies and their built-in incompetence to gain access to truth. The paper is an elucidation of Islamic conceptualization of truth as interpreted by the traditionalist school and which has been contrastively studied against the Western postmodern background. The author has aspired to undertake a reasoned critique of postmodern notions of truth and has presented the essential nature of truth as propounded by Islamic epistemology. The study aims at showing how humans have a profound need to believe that truth is rooted in the unchanging depths of the universe. One of the premises of the study is that truth is determined by the way things are and it is quite independent of our knowing it. &lt;o&gt; Theories of Truth "What is truth? said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an answer"1 Pilate's case in point could valuably be followed now, for the issue of truth has come under fresh discussion with the advent of postmodernism. Before discussing postmodern ideals of truth or its Islamic conceptualizations, a brief historical overview of various theories of truth proposed by Western philosophers is 1 Francis Bacon, The Essays (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 1.</page><page sequence="2">296 JAMIL ASGHAR necessary to set the argument in historical perspective. In the mainstream European philosophy four main theories of truth are found: correspondence, pragmatic , coherence, and deflationary theories. We will discuss these theories one by one. Correspondence theory is the earliest known theory of truth dating back to Plato (d. ca. 348/347 bc). In propounding this theory, the main purpose of Plato was to understand the meaning and acquisition of knowledge. He wished to draw a distinction between the false and true beliefs. He proposed that a true statement would correspond to the fact -the way things are (hence the name correspondence theory).2 To him such correspondence is intuitively recognizable by humans. This definition of truth encapsulates its common- sense notion. Plato's views on the nature of truth are contained in the dialogue Sophist 240a-b where the philosopher asks Theaetetus: "And you mean by true that which really is?" To this Theaetetus responds affirmatively.3 Another exponent of this theory was the theologian Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) who said, " Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus ("Truth is the equation [or adequation] of things and intellect").4 In our day, the American philosopher Richard Rorty (d. 2007) has mounted a sustained critique of the correspondence theory and he seems to despair of any idea of correspondence and absoluteness in truth.5 The proponents of the coherence theory claim that a set of beliefs is true if the beliefs are comprehensive, consistent, and do not contradict one another.6 This theory which was advanced by absolute idealists7 contends that the only absolute truth is "the whole"- anything less than that can only aspire to a degree of truth. If we cannot judge a belief against the facts, perhaps we should judge it against our other beliefs: Does it hang together with the rest of our beliefs? The coherence theorist says that the truth of a belief consists in its coherence with other beliefs.8 The next theory to be considered is the pragmatic theory that was presented by the American philosopher Charles S. Pierce (d. 1914). He asserted that concepts do not possess any intrinsic significance or truth value. 2 Michael Glanzberg, "Truth," in Edward N.

He defined truth as that which an ideal community of researchers could agree upon. Peirce concluded that many traditional philosophical concepts have no practical use and thus are meaningless.10 The theory was further developed by William James (d. 1910) and John Dewey (d. 1952), and its influence on modern philosophy has been immense. According to James's pragmatism, then, truth is that which works. As James put it, "The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process, the process namely of its verifying itself, its verification ."n Dewey, on the other hand, expresses his pragmatic approach to truth in these words: 7/* ideas, meanings, conceptions, notions, theories, systems are instrumental to an active reorganization of the given environment, to a removal of some specific trouble and perplexity, then the test of their validity and value lies in accomplishing this work. If they succeed in their office, they are reliable, sound, valid, good, true. If they fail to clear up confusion, to eliminate defects, if they increase confusion, uncertainty and evil when they are acted upon, then are they false.12 Historical knowledge is not simply the accretion of observed facts about the past; instead, it represents an assessment of the past that is formed according to current concerns, such as human rights or individual autonomy.13 The past is shaped along the lines of present and pragmatic concerns. An altogether different perspective on truth was proposed by the proponents of deflationary theory. Deflationary theory, in fact, dismisses the very question: What is truth ? This theory asserts that attaching the words "it is true that " to a statement adds no meaning to it at all. Deflationists also maintain that "substantive" theories of truth- such as the correspondence and coherence theories- are radically misguided: there is no substantive property of 9 See, Edward C.

"It is evident that 'It is true that Caesar was murdered' means no more than that Caesar was murdered."15 In the twentieth century, one of the most remarkable logicians who deeply influenced the debate on truth was Alfred Tarski (d. 1983). Though individualistic in nature, his theory of truth has been, nonetheless, very significant and it is pertinent to devote some space to it. Tarski presented a semantic theory of truth in formalized languages. He contends that the sentence "snow is white" is true, if and only if, snow is white. He then attempts to solve the logical paradoxes in the light of this conception of truth.16 All these theories have informed the debate on truth over the centuries and they have enriched our understanding of truth. Sometimes complementing each other, sometimes contradicting, these theories neither denied nor dismissed the existence of truth, something which, of late, has become a hallmark of most of the postmodern thinking. Postmodern Suspicion of Truth In order to gain a fuller perspective on our present-day suspicion of truth, we have to take into consideration the legacy of the Enlightenment and its radical individualism. The Enlightenment philosophers declared the individual as the creator and arbiter of meaning, truth, and even reality and most of the post- Enlightenment Western philosophy has toed this line of thought to date. More recently, on the epistemological front, postmodern forays have undermined not only the foundations of truth, but also the prospect of ever establishing any truth. Postmodernism denies the existence of an objective reality, postulating that reality is in the mind of the beholder. Thus, it asserts that we ourselves are the creators of our truths. Since Immanuel Kant (d. 1804), much of the Western philosophical drift has been suspicious of and inimical to the notion of truth. This has opened the sluice-gates to subjectivism and relativism which was to typify much of the later course of Western philosophy. These characterizations of truth can be presented as follows. Kant Truth per se is not accessible from the phenomenal world of ours. 14 See, Frank P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, ed. David Hugh Mellor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 173. 15 Ibid., 38. 16 See, Alfred Tarski, "The Semanantic Conception of Truth," Philosophy and Pbenomenological Research , 4: 3 (1944), 341-376.</page><page sequence="5">THE POSTMODERNIST RELATIVIZATION OF TRUTH: A CRITIQUE 299 Kierkegaard (d. 1855) Truth depersonalizes by distancing subject and object. Nietzsche (d. 1900) Truth is conditioned and determined by historicity. Wittgenstein (d. 1951) Truth stops with social horizons. Heidegger (d. 1976) Truth ceases to exist with the advent of phenomenology. Derrida (d. 1984) Truth leads to Logocentrism and eventually tyrannizes.17 Almost all postmodernists, in disputing past assumptions, generally exhibited a preoccupation with the inadequacy of language as a mode of communication. Three theorists of postmodernism- Jacques Lacan (d. 1981), Michel Foucault (d. 1984), and Derrida- launched an all-out attack on truth via language. All in all, it was language which had to bear the brunt of their critiques. The following is the outline of their arguments as to the nature and limits of truth and language 1. Ideas like those of "reason" and "truth" are the fictions of the Enlightenment. 2. Ideas about human nature and society which we assume to be permanent truths change over time. 3. Attitudes and assumptions that today seem natural or even inevitable are historical phenomena and mental constructs dependent upon time and place. 4. Instead of just reflecting the reality, language constitutes and constructs it. 5. Texts should be examined critically in order to get at the hidden meanings, though no final meaning, however complex, can be attributed to a text. 6. As a truth is presented in a text, an insidious transformation happens which affects and modifies the truth fundamentally.18 Therefore, one of the results of this postmodern approach was to discredit the efficacy of language itself. The following excerpt sums up the entire problem squarely: 17 See, Huston Smith, Beyond the Postmodern Mind : The Place of Meaning in a Global Civilization (Wheaton, IL: Quest Books, 1982), 24. 18 Terry Eagleton, The Illusions of Postmodernism (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), 135.</page><page sequence="6">■jQQ JAMIL ASGHAR The cumulative effect of all these various deconstructive techniques is simple: to deny language any role as a bearer of truth, thereby ridding it of its power and authority. Where structuralism insisted that language plays games with us, so post-structuralism celebrates our new-found freedom to play games with language. The deconstruction of language leaves postmodern readers free to create their own readings, driven by their personal desires, preferences and inclinations.19 Unfortunately, this dismissal of the expressiveness of language proved only a short step from a virtual disregard of truth itself- after all, all truths are couched in language. Consequently, postmodernists do not so much negate the truth as discount it. To them there is no such thing as truth or reality- hence the conclusion that all truths are relative and contingent. Postmodernism berates the confidence put in reason and language, but the real problem is that it does not offer any alternative. Weeding is indeed very good and essential periodically but it is not the substitute for planting. We think that Alfred Whitehead (d. 1947) is right in saying that if man cannot live by bread alone, still less can he live by disinfectants.20 Twentieth Century Analytic Challenge to Truth and Advent of the Deconstructors Much of the intellectual scene of the twentieth century Western world was dominated by what is known as the analytic philosophy whose avowed aim was to clarify language and analyze the concepts expressed in it. To analytical philosophers, most of the disputes as to the nature of truth and reality originate in linguistic confusion; and these disputes can be settled amicably once they are formulated in a precise and logical language.21 Difficulties arise when concepts are considered in isolation from the linguistic context in which they normally appear; thus attention to language as it is ordinarily used for everyday purposes is the key to resolving many philosophical puzzles. It was perhaps in this vein that Wittgenstein maintained that philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of human intelligence by language.22 As a representative of empiricism analytic philosophy is strongly tuned to take a reductionist view of reality. In fact, linguistic analysis per se is as old as philosophy itself. Plato in many of his dialogues is seen to have been 19 A. Wright, Religion, Education and Postmodernity (London: Routledge, 2004), 35. 20 Huston Smith, The Way Things Are: Conversations with Houston Smith on the Spiritual Life, ed.

So what makes the analytic philosophy unique is an unprecedented empiricist rigour. With its strong disregard for idealism and all the attendant notions of universal reality, it sought to reduce all complex propositions to their atomic components. To these philosophers, philosophy was, all things considered, an analysis underpinned by logic. Alfred J. Ayer (d. 1989), for instance, maintains that all meaningful statements are either empirical or analytical.23 According to this purportedly "verification principle," a statement is meaningful only if some sensory observation is relevant to determine its truth or it is analytical. Thus all those statements which are neither empirical nor analytical are meaningless. Hence he sets a kind of criterion by which meaningless propositions could be spotted. Nevertheless, Ayer's notion depends upon a surreptitious assumption that the only legitimate kind of verification is that used in the physical sciences. Thus to him all moral, non-empirical and non-analytical judgments are meaningless since they are not scientifically verifiable.24 This approach may have served some of the purely linguistic purposes but for the notion of truth and general human intellectual discourse its implications are indeed disastrous. Moreover, in a somewhat different vein, Wittgenstein also, had considered certain propositions to be nonsensical. To him, a sentence like "I know that I am in pain" is nonsensical and meaningless. He believes that in this sentence one is expressing not an ordinary empirical proposition but a proposition of grammar. Wittgenstein contends that all of us have an unimpeded access to our own inner sensations and we are directly aware of our pains. Therefore, "I know I am in pain" says no more than, "I am in pain." From this, Wittgenstein infers that putting the phrase "I know" before "I am in pain" adds nothing to the sum and substance of the assertion because it is understood that the person who reports that he is in pain he knows it. But Wittgenstein's conclusion seems problematic because even when the use of the expression "I know that" apparently serves no purpose, it still does not follow that it is devoid of sense and semantic import. For example, although people most commonly believe what they assert, the conventional effect of prefacing an assertion with the words "I believe that" is to weaken its force. It suggests that one is not entirely sure of those words. If someone says, for instance, "I believe that Smith has been elected," He commits himself less than if he had said outrightly "Smith has been elected."25 23 See, Alfred J. Ayer, Philosophy in the Twentieth Century (London: Weidinfeld, 1982), 95. 24 See, Max Chalesworth, Philosophy and Religion : From Plato to Postmodernism (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2002), 76. 25 See, Sara Ellenbogen, Wittgenstein's Account of Truth (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2003), 41.</page><page sequence="8">JQ2 JAMIL ASGHAR What goes wrong with the analytic philosophy was the blind belief in the efficacy of analysis and empiricism, whereas we have seen that, more often than not, analysis and empiricism are ill-suited to deal with truth. This analytic philosophy necessarily conjures for us an avowedly naturalistic world forgetting that truth is not always given to analysis and empiricism. Hannah Arendt (d. 1975) remarks poignantly, "Whatever is not given to the senses ... is more real, more truthful, more meaningful than what appears; that it is not just beyond sense perception but above the world of the senses."26 The problem plaguing our time is not how to analyze and dissect, but how to synthesize and reassemble. Robert Bellah once said, "We have no maps and we don't know how to make them."27 With Jacques Derrida28 the pendulum swung from analysis to deconstruction. Like other contemporary philosophies, deconstruction has also been inimical to the notion of truth, the more so since it denied the very existence of truth29 terming it a free play of signifier.10 The deconstructors, in the broadest sense, assume that knowledge suffers when we expect it to be objective. They call into question the possibility of determining the meaning of any text. To them determining one single meaning of a given text is to close the door on alternatives which results into dogmatism and occlusion. Thus by permitting the reader to create new meanings, the text was purportedly freed from the tyranny of the author's single intended meaning. Here, without going into much detail, we will highlight an inherent contradiction within deconstruction which renders it exceedingly problematic. Closer scrutiny reveals that ultimately all deconstructionist interpretations are similar, because they always lead us to interminable différance-ûie impossibility of establishing the final meaning of any text. However, it disregards one of the most apparent aspects and consequently contradicts its own premise. In fact, before a deconstructionist reading arrives at that point (that there is such a thing as interminable différanci), it has first uncovered the structures that operate in a text and shown us how these structures can be 26 Hannah Arendt, "Thinking and Moral Consideration," Social Research 38: 3 (1971), 240. 27 Smith, The Way Things Are , 12. 28 Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), French philosopher, with whose work originated the school of deconstruction. 29 Jacques Derrida, Writing and Difference , trans.

The victim's account of these experiences is not simply an arbitrary imposition of a purely fictive meaning on an otherwise meaningless reality" (Smith, Beyond the Postmodern Mind , 275, n. 8).</page><page sequence="9">THE POSTMODERNIST RELATIVIZATION OF TRUTH: A CRITIQUE -jq-J dismantled by making use of elements of the text itself.31 It is precisely because of this that J. Hills Miller (b. 1928), the Yale deconstructor, once put it, "[dļeconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself."32 To Hans Bertens, the endless play of différance not only affects the texts that Derrida and his followers deconstruct, but also affects their own deconstructions.33 Islamic Concept of Truth as Interpreted by Traditionalists The supreme concern of Islamic philosophy has been to take utmost care of truth and a slackening of this concern is all that has recently resulted in that confounding skepticism which has come to characterize our age. Thus the greatest obligation of a Muslim is towards "Truth" (al-Haqq) which is also another name of God. From this Truth (with a capital T) has originated that wisdom which is the guarantee of correct knowledge. In Islamic epistemology the loss of truth is not just an intellectual hammering; instead, it is the loss of the wisdom emanating from truth which severs our relation with the Divine. Consequently, we become more and more anthropomorphic in our reasoning, thereby casting reality in its own image. Thus the main thrust of Islamic epistemology has always been toward a serious regard of truth. Therefore it is incumbent upon Muslims to uphold it and protect it against the onslaught of all relativistic resignation,34 distortions and pragmatic contingencies of the day.35 It is for the sake of this very truth that human beings were created and placed as vice-gerents of God on earth. The Islamic concept of truth can be discussed under the following heads. Knowing is Being- Ontology Underpinning Islamic Epistemology In Islam the subjective pole of knowing is vertically linked with the objective pole of being. In fact Islamic philosophy envisages an integration of the whole cosmic order in which one finds an organic relation between various levels of 31 See, Hans Bertens, Literary Theory: The Basics (London: Routledge, 2001), 76. 32 J. H. Miller, "Stevens' Rock and Criticism as Cure Ü," Georgia Review 30: 2 (1976), 341. 33 See, Bertens, Literary Theory, 92. 34 This relativist resignation has been implicated in the efforts to maintain status quo: Evelyn Fox Keller, in a course on feminist theory at the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 1989, asserted: "Should postmodernism's seductive text gain ascendancy, it will not be an accident that power remains in the hands of the white males who currently posses it. In a world of radical inequality, relativist resignation reinforces the status quo" (Smith, Beyond Postmodern Mind, 276, n. 8). 35 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Traditional Islam in the Modern World (London/New York: Kegan Paul International, 1990), 97-107.</page><page sequence="10">3Q4 JAMIL ASGHAR reality. The Divine norm calibrates the whole paraphernalia of human existence, thereby setting everything in perspective and investing it with meaning. Seyyed Hossein Nasr makes the following point: Islam is based from beginning to end on the idea of Unity (tawhîd), for God is one. Unity is the alpha and omega of Islam. . . . But to the Muslim the idea of Unity does not just mean the assertion that there is only one God sitting in heaven instead of two or three. No religion could convert a quarter of the population of the globe and spread from Morocco to Indonesia with just such a simple idea. . . . Unity is, in addition to a metaphysical assertion about the nature of the Absolute, a method of integration, a means of becoming whole and realizing the profound oneness of all existence. . . . Every manifestation of human existence should be organically related to the Shahādah, lā ilāha ill* Allah, which is the most universal way of expressing Unity. This means that man should not be compartmentalized either in his thoughts or actions. Every action, even the manner of walking and eating, should manifest a spiritual norm which exits in his mind and heart.36 Now what are we to learn from this organic and integrated concept of reality which Islam seeks to teach us so earnestly? In fact, human beings are theomorphic beings and by nature they are in need of ultimate reality. The search for the Ultimate and the Absolute is an integral part of human psychology- thus knowing is a part of being. Islam envisages truth (even the one with small t) to have been deriving its essence, its trueness from the nature of things and we do not have the luxury to disregard it by calling it either a construct or a free play of signifier . Thus truthfulness is not a gratuitous quality bestowed upon a proposition either by a text or a context. A natural corollary of this is that in Islam epistemology has no existence apart from ontology and the former is always underpinned by the latter. All truths are linked with Truth in a vertical way and it is only through such an overarching reality that we can make sense of all things around us- even mundane things. It is ontology per se which postmodernism sets out to reject and to replace it with a kind of subversive epistemology. Huston Smith calls it Procrustean epistemology- scientistic in mode and analytic in operation- which has been fatal for all the notions of truth.37 In this epistemology the individual Cartesian consciousness of the thinking subject is taken to be the source of all reality and truth. All thinking is reduced to cerebral reasoning. It was this separation of epistemology from ontology which deprived Western 36 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Ideals and Realities of Islam (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1966), 29. 37 See, Smith, The Way Things Are , 10.</page><page sequence="11">THE POSTMODERNIST RELATIVIZATION OF TRUTH: A CRITIQUE 3Q5 epistemology of more than half of its explanatory power about our life and universe, leaving the scientists and thinkers free to dogmatize on their empiricist assumptions. Thus in a single stroke the notion of reality/ truth was first reduced to the realm of visible and then was denied altogether.38 Smith's contention on this count is at once vivid and accurate. To him this replacement of ontology with epistemology has been due to certain pragmatic concerns because this epistemology is particularly honed to augment our will to control , which is why it fared better than ontology. There are, of course, oceans of historical and psychological reasons for the West's having made this exchange [of ontology for epistemology], but no logical reasons. We simply slid into assuming that the most reliable viewfinder available to our human lot is the scientistic one that edits our spiritual truths in the way X-ray films omit the beauty of faces.39 Islamic epistemology, however, with its ontological underpinnings is ipso facto immune from the dangers which have been confronting Western epistemology. In Islamic epistemology, truth possesses an intrinsic worth and a normative dimension and at once defines and authenticates our existential discourse; and it does so without ever falling into subjectivism. In fact it is truth alone which permits us to escape from the prison of subjectivism and the passing fads of a particular historical epoch- hence it distinguishes itself from Nietzschean historicity. Truth, in this way, is supra-individual in nature.40 Truth is the Greatest Virtue and is not in Need of Human Sanction Islam values truth above all else and Islamic epistemology accords reasonable autonomy to truth and accepts its independent existence. In this way truth is largely de-relativized and stands in relation to the world on its own terms. Moreover, Islam considers truth to be synonymous with virtue and this virtuous nature of truth can also be taken to mean sacredness because in Islam the virtuous is the sacred. This sacred dimension of truth has always provided 38 Smith thinks that it was a loss of a "vertical perspective" which paved the way to nihilism, as hope "by definition implies going somewhere. . .* At our existential plane it is this vertical perspective which links us with a Transcendent Being and without an allusion to such a Being, no eternal hope can be cultivated in our hearts (See, Huston Smith, Forgotten Truth: The Primordial Tradition (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977), 120). 39 Smith, The Way Things Are, 10. 40 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, The Need for a Sacred Science (New York: State University of New York Press, 1993), 61.</page><page sequence="12">■}Q£ JAMIL ASGHAR a transcendent coloration to Islamic art and thought.41 This very transcendent ambience makes Islamic concept of truth trans-historical and utterly opposite to Nietzschean historicity. Instead, in Islamic epistemology truth has always been presented in a radically non-epistemic garb, and it is not determined solely by consciousness, linguistic conventions, conditions of evidence, or verifiability. It is determined by the way things are and this is quite independent of our knowing of it. Furthermore, truth has no obligation to accommodating itself to us; it is we who must accommodate ourselves to it: There are some who mistake this point [the failure of metaphysics to demonstrate the existence of truth] for the end of the world; whatever can be neither imaged nor coherently conceived, they argue, does not exist. But truth does not need us and is in no way dependent upon our powers of conceptualization. There are regions of being- the unimaginable perfection of totality is at the moment the case in point- that are quite unrelated to the contours of the human mind. The mind is comfortable with facts and fictions. It is not made for grasping ultimates.42 If Islamic epistemology rejects our anthropomorphic conceptualizations of truth, it also rejects the pragmatic theories of truth as well as the dubious assumption about the instrumental nature of truth. No doubt, the pragmatic attitude is an appropriate part of life, but to make it the whole of life, and the version of truth it supports the whole of truth, is at once misleading and dangerous. Let us consider the statement: "All men must die." A justified and pragmatic objection to such a statement can be like this, "But surely that can't be true, for it makes people sad and fatalistic." Now pragmatically this objection is quite valid; however, making it the very criterion for truth will not only be outlandish but also precarious. Truth cannot be Generated The third characteristic of truth in Islamic epistemology is that it is an a priori presence and not a fortuitous creation of human beings. All the ideals and notions of truth are present and rooted in the fabric of our being and humans can just exteriorize them by making use of all the sources of knowing. Frithjof Schuon (d. 1998) explains this point: Few topics are so unrewarding as conventional laments about the 'researches of the human mind' never being satisfied; in fact everything has been said already, 41 See, Frithjof Schuon, Survey of Metaphysics and. Esoterismi (Bloomington: World Wisdom Books, 1986), 67. 42 Smith, Forgotten Truth, 58.</page><page sequence="13">THE POSTMODERNIST RELATIVIZATION OF TRUTH: A CRITIQUE jQj though it is far from being the case that everyone has always understood it. There can therefore be no question of presenting 'new truths'; what is needed in our time. . . is to provide some people with keys fashioned afresh- keys no better than the old ones but merely more elaborated- in order to help them to rediscover the truths written in an eternal script in the very substance of man's spirit.43 Etymologically, the word used for truth in Islam is haqiqah . This haqlqah is also called lubb which means "kernel" or "quintessence." As Allah mentions in the Holy Qur'ân: "those who possess the kernels (3: 7)," meaning "those who have insight or grasp the essence." Now this essence makes truth essential . Truth is Vertical and non-Anthropomorphic The notion of beauty invests truth with a verticality and eventually connects the upward arm of truth with the divine. This verticality is the most apparent feature of all knowledge in Islam. In fact, in Islamic epistemology no knowledge can be worthwhile unless it is related to the higher plane and ultimately to God, Who, being the Truth, is the source and summit of all knowledge.44 Besides, truth is non-anthropomorphic with its reliance upon the Divine Intellect rather than upon human reason. So long as the subjective pole of knowledge is concerned, all of our conceptualizations are avowedly anthropomorphic. Islam has a non-anthropomorphic concept of truth as the locus of knowledge is not human brain but Divine Intellect. Nasr exposes the fallacy of the modern day anthropomorphic nature of philosophical thought in the following words: Modern thought, of which philosophy is in a sense the father and progenitor, became profoundly anthropomorphic the moment man was made the criterion of reality. When Descartes uttered, 'I think, therefore I am' (cogito ergo sum), he placed his individual awareness of his own limited self as the criterion of existence, for certainly the T in Descartes' assertion was not the Divine T who, through Hallāj, exclaimed, 'I am the Truth' (ana'l-Haqq): the Divine T which alone, according to traditional doctrines, has the right to say T. Until Descartes, it was Pure Being, the Being of God, which determined human existence and the various levels of reality. But with Cartesian rationalism, individual human existence became the criterion of reality and also the truth.45 43 Frithjof Schuon, Understanding Islam (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1972), 7. 44 See, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Knowledge and the Sacred (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1980), chapter 1. 45 Nasr, Traditional Islam , 100.</page><page sequence="14">3Qg JAMIL ASGHAR Furthermore, truth is not dependent upon reason because reason has not created it. Instead, truth reveals itself and becomes explicit with the help of reason. We do not say that something is true because it is logical, but rather the reverse, that it is logical because it is true. One is reminded of C. S. Lewis (d. 1963) who once said that he believed that the sun had risen not because he could see it but because by way of it he could see everything else.46 Truth Endures The fifth distinguishing trait of truth in Islamic philosophy is that it endures. Whereas in the Western philosophy the hermeneutics of suspicion and doctrines like relativism and existentialism have been detrimental to truth, in Islamic tradition the endurance and permanence of truth has always been an abiding principle. This endurance and permanence of truth in Islam is echoed by Iqbal with his artistic brilliance: Zamānah aik, hayãt aik, kā'ināt bhi aik Dalil-i kam nam, qissah-i jadid-o qadim Cosmos and life are one, The world is one and same. The tale of old and new Is merely false and lame.47 Even in Western philosophical tradition there has been no dearth of those who maintained this abiding and enduring feature of truth. Plato, Pythagoras (d. ca. 495 bc), Gottfried Leibniz (d. 1716), Georg Hegel (d. 1831) all believed in the permanence and universality of truth. Hegel believed that absolute truth or reality exists and that the human mind can know it because whatever is real is rational. He conceived the subject matter of philosophy to be reality as a whole, a reality that he referred to as "Absolute Spirit," or cosmic reason. The world of human experience, whether subjective or objective, he viewed as the manifestation of Absolute Spirit.48 Hegel, Francis Bradley (d. 1924) and Harold Joachim (d. 1938) believed in the organic nature of truth whereby truth was totally identified with reality- truth is but reality qua thought.49 In recent times, the German philosopher Theodore Adorno (d. 1969) has mounted a 44 See, C.

He also argued that rationality has not been an emancipatory force, but that modern science is an instrument of dehumanization.50 Likewise, the American philosopher Josiah Royce (d. 1916) believes in an absolute truth about the existence of which everyone agrees. Denying the existence of absolute truth affirms the existence of another truth, and so confirms the possibility of truth.51 The opinions of these Western thinkers (both ancient and modern) show that even within the Western tradition, the constancy and objectivity of truth has been widely recognized and the present-day postmodern dismissal of it is more of an aberration than a normality. So far as Islamic tradition is concerned, Schuon tells us how truth is inherent in the depths of human heart with all stability and universality It is indispensable to know . . . that there are truths inherent in the human spirit that are as if buried in the "depths of the heart," which means that they are contained as potentialities or virtualities in the pure Intellect: these are the principal and archetypal truths, those which prefigure and determine all others. They are accessible intuitively and infallibly, to the "gnostic," the "pneumatic," the "theosopher"- in the proper and original meaning of these terms- and they are accessible consequently to the "philosopher" according to the still literal and innocent meaning of the word: to a Pythagoras or a Plato, and to a certain extent even to an Aristotle, in spite of his exteriorizing and virtually scientistic perspective.52 Today this enduring and stable characteristic of truth is being increasingly rejected in the name of relativism. But relativism is an unlivable philosophy as Huston Smith puts it53 and is in constant danger of spiraling into cynicism and despair. Moreover absolute relativism is not even a coherent philosophy, for in turning relativism into an absolute it involves into an internal contradiction.54 Therefore we can easily recognize the predicament of relativism. Terry Eagleton points to the self-refuting nature of relativism/postmodernism in the following words: But in seeking to cut the ground from under its opponents' feet, Postmodernism finds itself unavoidably pulling the rug out from under itself, leaving itself with 50 Theodor Adorno, Metaphysics : Concept and Problems , ed.

Moreover, our freedom is epitomized by our ability to choose. Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. This very essentiality of choice was the nightmare of all the existentialists from Kierkegaard to Sartre. It is not our aim in this study to describe all the possible implications of these questions. However, philosophically, socially and morally, post- modernism is obliged to work out answers to these questions if somehow we are to live in this world of freedom and choice which every now and then calls for a sound judgment of right and wrong. Truth Matters One final but crucial characteristic of Islamic concept of truth is that according to it truth mattersy and humans in no way can afford to dismiss it, not to speak of confronting it. Smith puts forth this point thus: Man has a profound need to believe that the truth he perceives is rooted in the unchanging depths of the universe; for were it not so, could the truth be really important? Yet how can he so believe when others see truth so differently? Archaic man, wrapped in his tribal beliefs like a chrysalis in a cocoon, did not have this problem. Even civilized man on the whole has been spared it, for until recently the various civilizations have been largely self-contained. It is we- we moderns, we worldly wise- who experience the problem acutely.58 55 Terry Eagleton, The Illusions of Postmodernism (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), 67. 56 Hamlet says this to Rosencrantz in the play, Act D, Scene E. Version: Arden Shakespeare Q 2, ed. Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor (London: Arden Shakespeare, 2006). 57 This declaration itself is a negation of relativism as it universalizes all the higher values of humanity whereas relativism does not permit any such universalization. 58 Smith, Forgotten Truth , ix.</page><page sequence="17">THE POSTMODERNIST RELATIVIZATION OF TRUTH: A CRITIQUE 3 Both Derrida and Heidegger, who so artistically belittled the significance of truth, fear that truth marginalizes because the conviction that we are the sole owner of the truth can make us berate the others. A deeper examination, however, reveals the inherent weakness of this argument. We all know that no idea is worth its while if it does not marginalize ; that is, if it does not sift right from wrong or, for that matter, relevance from irrelevance. In this respect every idea that asks to be taken seriously must marginalize its contrary, and thereby imply the irrelevance of the latter. Moreover, where are we to turn our attention to, if we do not have a sense of what is important and what is not or, for that matter, what is relevant and what is not?59 So truth will qualify as truth only when it marginalizes, and, in principle, no sane mind can have a quarrel with this argument. Thus the charge of marginalization instead of subtracting anything from the validity and significance of truth adds infinitely to it. Conclusion In sum, the whole drift of postmodern argument goes on to question the efficacy of language and to relativize the truth by deconstructing all the meta- narratives spun by the Enlightenment. Consequently, postmodernism does not so much negate the truth as discounts it. Much of the twentieth century was dominated by the analytic philosophy whose avowed aim was to clarify and analyze language. Given its strong empiricist leanings and its single- minded obsession with analysis, the analytic philosophy considered all non- empirical and non-analytical sentences meaningless. With the arrival of deconstruction, the very possibility of establishing meanings/interpretations was disputed because we were told that an interminable differance leads to ever new interpretations. Truth was termed just a free play of signifier without any corresponding reality either textual or contextual. However, in the final analysis deconstruction, like relativism, is judged to be self-dismantling. Against this background the Islamic epistemological notion of truth has been presented and can be appreciated with renewed insight. In Islam knowing is intimately linked to being and Islamic epistemology is underpinned by ontology. Islam envisages an integration of the whole cosmic order in which one finds an organic relation between various levels of reality. Thus truthfulness is not a gratuitous quality bestowed upon a proposition either by a text or a context. It is ontology per se which postmodernism sets out to reject and to replace it with a kind of an utterly analytical and deconstructive 59 See, Smith, Beyond the Postmodern Mind , 218.</page><page sequence="18">3J2 JAMIL ASGHAR epistemology which has been proved fatal for all the notions of truth and reality as in this epistemology the individual Cartesian consciousness of the thinking subject is taken to be the source of all reality and truth. The supreme concern of Muslim minds over the centuries has been to take utmost care of truth and a slackening of this concern is all that has recently resulted in contemporary skepticism and existentialism. Therefore, it is imperative for Muslims to uphold it and protect it against the onslaught of all relativities, distortions and pragmatic contingencies of the day. In Islamic view, truth is synonymous with virtue which provides it with a transcendent ambience that makes the Islamic ideal of truth trans-historical and utterly opposite to Nietzschean historicity. It is rádically non-epistemic and is not determined solely by human consciousness or linguistic conventions. On the contrary, it is determined by the way things are and this is quite independent of our knowing of it. The locus of knowledge in Islam is not human cerebral brain but Divine Intellect. Finally, truth matters and man has a profound need to believe that the truth he perceives is rooted in the unchanging depths of the universe; for were it not so, could the truth be really important? $ $ $</page></plain_text>
