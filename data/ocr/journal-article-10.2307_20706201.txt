<plain_text><page sequence="1">RJABCHIKOV'S DECIPHERMENTS EXAMINED Jacques B. M. Guy The short communication by Rjabchikov in this issue of the Journal contains additional evidence for his decipherment of glyph 2 of his nomenclature (755 of Barthers) as "Hina", and one important observation: that the hand shapes ex emplified in glyphs 15a, 15b, and 15c of his nomenclature (6,61 and 64, respec tively, of Barthers) are probably nonsignificant variants of the same grapheme. These are the two reasons why Rjabchikov's communication deserves attention. At the same time, it is necessary to warn that Rjabchikov's methodology is un sound and that the other readings proposed have negligible probabilities. Glyph references will be preceded by R (Rjabchikov) or B (Barthel), depend ing on whose nomenclature is used, readings given in square brackets, and reference to the tablets using Barthel's system. The hand shapes as exemplified in R15A and R15C [ro], respectively Barthel's B6 [rima] and B64 [poul], are claimed to be nondistinctive. This is indeed very likely, but the case is not argued convincingly. First, frag. 1 and 2, Fig. 3 have been taken out of their context. It is only by going back to the tracings of the tablets in Barthel's 1958 "Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinslenschrift" that we can ascertain that their contexts are indeed similar, and that the difference in hand shapes is then possibly nonsignificant. Frag. 3 and 4 are, likewise, quoted without context, but in their case we need only turn back to Figure 2, where they appear in frag. 1 and 2. Second, four instances of seemingly free alternation be tween two glyph forms are too few to constitute a proof. It is only by a careful study of how often what substitutions occur in what environments that one may discover when and where which may occur in lieu of which. Third, the other hand shape listed under R15 (B61 [kai]), also presumably an allograph, is not discuss ed. Nevertheless, from long hours of studying the reproductions of the tablets in Barthel's' 'Grundlagen'', I tend to the opinion that hand shapes may well be non significant, at least in many environments. It would, however, have been nice to have been presented with proper evidence. In both his earlier paper (/PS, 96:361-7) and this present one, Rjabchikov claims the reading "Hina" for R2 (B755 [tone]). This is an interesting reading which has some chances of being true, however much I am averse on principle to assigning any readings to the glyphs at this stage. First, the one and only part of the corpus of Easter Island inscriptions, the meaning of which is known beyond reasonable doubt, is a fragment of Tablet Mamari (Cb6 to Cb9) shown by Barthel to contain a lunar calendar. Second, the study of this fragment shows B40A (R3B) to represent a count of one night. B40A is known to have an environment conditioned allograph, B42 (R3Q, also crescent-shaped but rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. The top part of B755 [tane] (R2 [hina]) is also crescent-shape 321</page><page sequence="2">322 Jacques B. M. Guy and somewhat similar to B42, only much more deeply curved. This might be a third allograph, occurring as the top, hence last, part of a glyph, when B42 occurs as its bottom, hence first, part. Third, about the middle of the lunar calendar on Tablet Mamari we find a glyph B152 representing the full moon, and the lower half of the anthropomorphic figure inside it is similar to that of B755. If the top of B755 is indeed an allograph of B40A and if'it functions as an ideogram ? not a phonogram ? then B755 is likely to have to do with a being associated with the moon or the night count, and may be an ideogram for Hina. RJABCHIKOV'S METHODOLOGY Rjabchikov's nomenclature shows no internal structure and no ordering scheme and is neither adaptable nor expandable. It restores chaos where Barthel had brought order. Checking Rjabchikov's claims is all the more difficult, in that figures are given without the corresponding readings (those beneath each glyph and the ligatures shown in his earlier paper were inserted by me for the readers' convenience, a chore I had neither the leisure nor the inclination to repeat). By flipping back and forth from the text to the figures and the nomenclature, interested readers will see that R6 [ha], already burdened with five allographs, acquires six new ones (B306 and B304 in frag. 1 and 2, Fig. 1; B220 and B320 in frag. 3 and 4, Fig. 2; B206 and B224 in frag. 1 and 9, Fig. 4). Further, R31 [maki], with a single glyph listed in the nomenclature, acquires two allographs in the text ("31a" and "31b"), and eight in the five fragments in Fig. 5. These eight glyphs are given without any context and only the first two fragments belong to parallel texts. From the reproductions in Barthers "Grundlagen" it will be noted that their immediate contexts are rather dissimilar (they are in fifth and sixth position of Hv3 and 11th and 12th of Pv5). As for the rest (to be found towards the end of Ab7, right at the end of Br5, and one third of the way through Ra2), their respec tive contexts are utterly dissimilar. So are their shapes. The evidence that they are allographs of one another is nil. The glyphs in Rjabchikov's nomenclature also acquire new phonetic values. In frag. 9, Fig. 3, only one glyph retains its original phonetic value: R16 [kahi]. If we update the nomenclature to fit in the new values found in this single fragment, we now have R6 [ha, a], R4 [atu, tua], R44 [taa, tua, ta], R26 [maa, mua, nga], R15 [ro, rod]. Yet, to reach the reading "Atu kahi(ter), atu Tangaroa (ter)" fur ther violence has to be made to the data: the first four occurrences of R44 are ignored, and a nonexistent final R15 is restored. Admittedly, multiple, not necessarily close, phonetic values are common in mixed phonetic and ideographic writing systems, but here, despite new values be ing introduced without warning or justification, on an ad hoc basis, the readings obtained remain unconvincing. Using Rjabchikov's own expanded nomenclature, it is easy to find more convincing alternative interpretations. Frag. 9 Fig. 3 easily yields five more readings:</page><page sequence="3">Decypherments Examined 323 1. Atua Kahi (ter); atua Maro (ter) "The Bonito God; the June God". (R6 4 44 is [a-atu-tua], a typical case of overspelling for atua. Other occur rences of R44 [tua] obviously atua abbreviated, and R26 15 [maa-ro] naturally Maro) 2. Hatu, tuu kahi (ter); Hatu, tuu Maro (ter) "Tiki, the bonito comes; Tiki, June comes" (R6 4 [ha-atu] hence Hatu, Rjabchikov equating Hatu with Tiki. R44 [taa, tua ta] becomes [tuu], Rjabchikov translating tuu by "come"). 3. Hatu tuu, kahi tuu (ter); Hatu tuu, Maro tuu (Ms), mai "Tiki comes, the bonito comes; Tiki comes, June comes, hither" (R15 [mua, maa, ma] becomes [mail) 4. Hatu tuu, kahi tuu (ter); Hatu, tamaroa (ter) "Tiki comes, the bonito comes; Tiki, the male". 5. Hatu tua, kahi tua (ter); Hatu tamaroa (ter). "Tiki of the high seas, the bonito of the high seas'; Tiki the male". The third interpretation is clearly the best, as it neither omits nor invents any glyph, and does not make any less sense than the others, including Rjabchikov's. Many more readings are possible, using only the phonetic values above. CONCLUSION Although his methods are basically flawed and his interpretation no more pro bable than those of anyone with some imagination and skill, it is quite possible, even probable, that, through long pouring over the reproductions of the tablets, Rjabchikov may have gained valuable albeit intuitive and subliminal insight into their writing system (the likelihood of the nonsignificance of hand shapes in anthropomorphic glyphs, the possibility of B755 actually representing Hina or a being connected with the moon, suggest it). For this reason it is all the more im portant that those insights be presented. But the evidence must be given in a coherent manner, with phonetic values and full readings where they belong, beneath the corresponding glyphs in the figures. If glyphs must be referenced at all in the text, let it be using Barthel's system, and let every glyph in the figures (whether cited or not in the text) have underneath it its reference number along with its phonetic value and reading. Had Rjabchikov taken the pains to present his findings in an orderly manner, he would himself have seen the weakness of his evidence.</page></plain_text>
