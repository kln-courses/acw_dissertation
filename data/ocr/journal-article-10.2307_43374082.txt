<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Lāt Bhairo at Benares (Vārāņasī): Another Pre-Ašokan Monument? By John Irwin, Washington, D.C.* In recent years, evidence has been accumulating to suggest that some of India's earliest sculptured monuments traditionally known as 'Ašokan' pillars, are in fact pre-Ašokan survivals, associated with pre- Buddhist cosmic religion. It has lately been discovered that the pillar at Allahabad is one of these, and that contrary to general belief it had always existed at its present site, ancient Prayäga, and that its missing emblem had been, not a lion as once thought, but a bull of brahmanical religion.1 These views have since been developed in a paper presented to the Royal Asiatic Society in London, showing why ancient Prayäga had been an important centre of pillar-worship from pre-Buddhist times, with the reputation of being the centre of the universe where heaven and earth had been separated at the Creation.2 In this paper, our starting-point is a pillar located 100 km. further East on the outskirts of Benares (ancient Vārāņasī), capital of the old kingdom of Kāšī. Locally, this pillar is known as the Lāt Bhairo, lite- rally the staff of Bhairo or Bhaironāth,3 the boundary-god of that city who is worshipped as hereditary policeman or kotwãl , assimilated in Hindu legend to Šiva in his fearsome or terrifying form (Sanskrit bhairava) .

Nearby is a water-tank still used for ritual bathing; remains of an ancient well; a sacred tree still under worship; and an ancient crossroads, formerly the location of an annual festival now lapsed and forgotten. To these can be added other features familiar to students of ancient Indian pillar-cults, including the nearby presence of a river-crossing (tīrtha) and the confluence of two sacred streams, in this case the Ganga and the Varuņa. There are rumours, too, of traces of a sacred tumulus, said to have served as a Buddhist stūpa. Each of these features has been discussed in connection with other 'Asokan-' pillar sites.5 Ironically in this case, the remains of the pillar cannot be closely examined, because it is now invisible beneath its protective copper sheeting. When visited in 1979, it was located behind a brick wall too high for any but the tallest to see over (fig. 3), and under the guard of armed policemen. Strangest of all, this weird object stood within the sacred precinct of an Islamic mosque, properly called cīdgāh. An cīdgāh is a place of community prayer: its bare essentials are an open praying area with nothing but a qibla wall and a mihräb. Of particular interest to us - as we shall later come to recognize - are the archaic religious asso- ciations of the cīdgāh with the Feast of the Sacrifice of Abraham, which anciently gave it the function of a 'Sacred Centre', reminiscent of the place of the pillar as 'Axis Mundi' in archaic cosmic religion. At the present day, the Lāt Bhairo is under regular worship by Hindus as the phallic symbol (Unga) of Šiva. No wonder the Lāt Bhairo is dreaded by the authorities responsible for law and order. As potential flashpoint of communal rioting, it is a reminder of an actual riot that took place at this spot nearly two centu- ries ago - reputedly the worst ever on Indian soil when thousands were massacred. It was then that the pillar - once described as 100 ft. (about 30 m.) tall - was burnt and felled, leaving only the stump we now see encased in protective copper. Yet, up to the present day, this object is venerated as the holiest object in Hindu Vārāņasī! 5 For full discussion, see my four papers issued in successive volumes of the Burlington Magazine, London, between 1973 and 1976: John Irwin: ť "Aéokan" Pillars: a re-assessment of the evidence Introduction (Part I).

The Pippal tree worshipped beside the stump is said to be the scion of an earlier tree destroyed in the riot. Another story, first reported in 1828, 7 says that the shaft of the pillar had once been 'covered with ancient carvings' (which could have referred to archaic, still undeci- phered inscriptions, and that the shaft of the pillar had been sinking into the subsoil. Whatever the truth, no attempt has ever been made to verify the facts by investigating beneath the copper for fear of provoking another riot.8 At the left or western end of the terrace, the photograph shows an Islamic pavilion (now used to shelter guarding policemen) built by 6 The earliest reliable source of topography is James Prinsep's map of Vārāņasī surveyed by him in 1823 when secretary of the Asiatic Society of Benares, a copy of which is preserved in the India Office Library, London.

London 1868, tanks around the Lāt&gt; Bhairo being discussed at p. 190. 7 Bishop Heber: Narrative of a journey thro ' the Upper Provinces of India from Calcutta to Bombay. London 1828, p. 323. Rumours about the shaft sinking into subsoil, commonly heard at other pillar sites in India, may have derived from half-forgotten myth, now legend, about cosmic pillars being founded in the waters beneath the earth (equated with the netherworld). Cf. rumours which circulated around the Topra pillar at Delhi discussed in Part IV of my Burlington series, p. 744 (cited above at fn. 5); and again in association with the Meerut pillar as described by William Finch in 1608 and discussed in my paper The ancient pillar-cult at Prayâga : its pre-Aéokan origins ., cited above at fn. 2. Bishop Heber included in his report the local belief that as a result of sinkage, the top of the pillar would eventually become level with the ground, and that . all Hindus would then be outcasted . . .' My friend Stephen Cross comments perceptively in a letter that this must refer to 'the gradual decline of righteousness through the four yugas or ages and particularly during the current Kali Yuga', implying that the cosmic pillar is synonymous with religious Law (dharma), as we know from other sources (see below, pp. 344-5, and fn. 65). 8 The possibility of contamination with myth was not taken into account by D.D. Ko s ambi when campaigning for excavation of the Lāt Bhairo in order to ascertain whether it was inscribed (Times of India, 28th January, 1965). Since Aéokan pillars were not usually engraved within seven feet of ground level, the likelihood that the stump embodies such evidence seems to me unlikely. It would be more interesting to investigate whether it was founded on a placement stone (like other pillars, proved to have been erected by Aéoka), or whether it had been erected without evidence of a placement- stone, as seems to have been the case with pre-Aéokan bull- and elephant-pillars (see my Burlington series, Part III, cited above at fn. 5).</page><page sequence="5">The Lat Bhairo at Benares (Varaņasi) 325 Aurangzeb with materials robbed from demolished Buddhist, Jain or Hindu shrines in the vicinity. The modern visitor has an impression that he is witnessing a relatively late stage in the history of a site that had once been sacred to all Indian religions and was probably older than any of them. What a strange medley! How can it be sorted out, and what can we learn in the process? First to offer suggestions was E. B. Havell: Benares , the Sacred City. London 1905. Publication of this book coincided with the sensational discovery by archaeological excavation of the remains of the famous Aáokan pillar at Sārnāth, a few kilometres to the north-east, where the Buddha is said to have preached his First Sermon.9 Four years after 9 In light of recent publications by André Bareau, Professor of Buddhism at the Collège de France (Le Buddha et Uruvilvā. In: Indianisme et Bouddhisme, Mélanges offerts a Mgr. Etienne Lamotte. Louvain: Univ. cathol. 1980. (Publica- tions de l'Institut orientaliste de Louvain. No. 23.) pp. 1-18; and Benares et le Bouddhisme antique. In: Ludwik Sternbach Felicitation Volume. Lucknow: Akhila Bharatiya Sanskrit Parishad 1981, pp. 471-78), is it too soon to ask if the story of the Buddha's life as told in canonical texts could be mainly mythical rather than historical? This may apply both to the story of the Buddha's Enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, and to the Preaching of the First Sermon in the Deerpark at Sārnāth (Benares). However, these doubts need not detain us here, since Professor Bareau' s startling conclusions are irrelevant to the main lines of our present investigation into the Lāt Bhairo. I have already returned to this subject in a paper entitled Buddhism and the Cosmic Pillar written as an offering to the Felicitation Volume in honour of Professor Giuseppe Tucci , now being edited by Prof. Gherardo Gnoli for the Istituto Italiano Medio ed Estreme Oriente, Rome, to be presented in June, 1984. In the meantime the reader should hold in suspense the traditional testimony of Buddhologists which makes of Benares and its environs in the Buddha's lifetime one of the principal cities in the legend. In my opinion, historians, too, have overestimated the extent to which the 'historical' religions based the legends of their founders' 'lives' on 'real' history. The same overestimate is deeply-rooted in dogmas supported by archaeologists (often the first to stress the importance of 'facts' versus 'speculation'!). I tried to demonstrate some of these points following the public attack on my thesis and historical method delivered by my respected colleague, friend, and challenger Dr. Raymond Allchin; both attack and reply are published in full in: The Stūpa, its religious, historical and archaeological signi- ficance.

I have returned to this thesis in detail in my latest paper, Buddhism and the Cosmic Pillar written for the Tucci Volume (see above), where the relationship between 'history' and 'myth' in early religions is extensively discussed in relationship to the stauros, the 'Rood-tree', and the so-called 'Cross' associated by the established Church with their own (unsubstantiated) version of Christian Salvation.</page><page sequence="6">326 John Irwin this, the historian Vincent Smith added authority to Havell's opinion by claiming the Lāt Bhairo was not only a relic of the Aáokan period, but the actual pillar described by the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hsüan-Tsang, when he visited Vārānasī in 636 A.D.10 Smith's argu- ments have not since been given the weight they deserve, yet in my opinion they are incontrovertible. Hsüan-Tsang had written: To the north-east of the city, on the west side of the river Varuņa, is a stūpa build by Aáoka-rãja; its height is 100 ft. or more. In front of it has been raised a stone pillar . . .,u He then goes on to describe the shaft as pi-hsien or bi-xiãn H jjßL Julien, in his pioneer French translation of 1857 rendered this word as 'bleu';12 Be al, in the first English translation, as 'stone, bright as jade'.13 Watters, in a later English version, as 'green stone, of fresh colour'.14 How can the same term be interpreted with such different meanings?15 10 E. B. Havell, op. cit.; and F. 0. Oertel: Excavations at Sārnāth. In: Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Report 1904-05, pp. 68-70. Half a century before this, M. C. Sherrring had already claimed 'strong reason for believing that the Lāt Bhairo was an Aéokan pillar' (Sherring, op. cit. p. 306). 11 Vincent A.

II, p. 48. 15 After addressing the question independently to experienced Sinologists, I have received the following comments. Dr. Vande Walle of the Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, comments as follows: "The crucial phrase used by Hsüan- tsang is: pi-hsien jo ching kuang-chun ning-liu. First, I have checked the term pi- hsien in Morohashi, Dau Kanwajiten , 24334. The only thing I found there is that it is 'another name for bamboo'. From the passages Morohashi quotes in support it appears that it should be understood as a descriptive term for bamboo rather than a synonym. The Tz'u-hai (1979 edn.) does not even list the compound (in my copy pi is listed on pp. 3767-3768) . . . Apparently lexicographers are not familiar with Hsüan-tsang's use of the term. Leaving the binomen pi-hsien aside, ancient sources suggest that the term pi alone is used for bluish green jade (jasper), and hence for deep green colour and for whitish green as well. As an adjective (as first character in a binomen) it is often used in describing plants or water, or indeed the sky, though the associations with water (waves, pond, etc.) appear to be far more frequent. As for the term hsien, it has several meanings, but the ones applicable in the compound pi-hsien are: new, fresh, clear, bright, good and beautiful. Water is often compared to a mirror (ching). Consequently the four character phrase pi-hsien jo ching makes perfect sense: "bright bluish- green as a mirror". Now the second four-character phrase: kuang-chun ning-liu. Kuang-chun is a perfectly understandable binomen meaning 'lustre'. Ning-liu</page><page sequence="7">The Lat Bhairo at Benares (Varaņasi) 327 According to lexicons specializing in traditional Chinese usage, pi (or bi) in ancient compounds could mean among other things (1) 'fresh', 'pure', 'good', 'beautiful'. The fundamental meaning of this word is also 'freshness of fìsh' or 'fresh as fish'. We should be reminded here of the close relationship Greek scholars have noticed between colour and materials: in Mycenean and Greek tradition, for instance, where kúwano (in Mycenean) and kuwanos (in Greek) refer not only to enamels or glass-pastes, but also to the colour (blue or bluish-green).16 Similarly, Chinese lexicons tell us that pi in ancient compounds meant both jade, and the bluish-green especially associated with early jadestone carvings, but equally applicable to the celestial colour of the sky or heavens (reminding us of our English phrase 'the Blue of Heaven'). The same sources17 mention pi-yü ^ 3£ as having been applied in early Chinese literature to ritual-objects carved in bluish-green jade and 'blue sapphire'. The latter recalls however seems to be contradictory at first sight. Ning means 'to coagulate', while liu means 'to flow'. There are, however, several binomina with ning as the first character where it seems to connote the dark green quality of still water. The bi-nomen ning-chun indicates the thick, coagulated almost palpable quality emitted by the lustre of an object. Moreover, there is an expression liu-kuang: overflowing brilliance. Consequently the descriptive connotations of ning and liu are perfectly reconcilable. The two characters may be taken as a binomen that could be translated as 'refulgent'. The complete sentence may be translated: bright bluish-green as a mirror and with refulgent lustre. It is quite obvious that the brilliance is overwhelming, for, in Hsüan-tsang's words, the image of the Buddha is always present in the radiance [see below, p. 344]." Commenting independently, without having read the above remarks, my friend Hisayoshi Miyamoto, a post-graduate student at Benares Hindu University, adds the following: "The element bi' (§|) is composed of 3 parts: 3E&gt; fÈJ and Among these three parts 3Î and |=3 represent its [the word ^'s] meaning, while Ö represents its pronunciation. 3: is equal to 3£ Cyù'), and the meaning of it is jewel. ('shi') means stone. 1ËJ ('bài' in modern Chinese and 'bó' in classical and literary Chinese) means white, but in the composed word 'bi' (^) , [ÈÎ should not be taken as the meaningful part, but should be taken as the pronunciation sign". He adds that though Q is in this context merely an indication of pronun- ciation, it denotes an impression of brightness. The meanings of the word 'bi' are (1) beautiful blue-coloured stone; (2) green, blue, bluish-green, deep blue. 16 This question has recently been examined by Robert Halleux: Lapis- lázuli. Azurite ou Pâte de verre? A propos de Kuwano ou Kuwanowoko dans les Tablettes Mycéniennes. In: Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici 9 (1969), pp. 47-66, esp. p. 56. 17 Morohashi: Dau Kanwajiten, 24334. Reference kindly given to me by Dr. Michael Loewe, who also refers to Tz'u-hai, 1965 edn., published by Chung- hua shu-chu, 1979, p. 3162. Sinologists have often noted the imprecision with which Chinese writers use 'blue' and 'green', and I shall return to this presently.</page><page sequence="8">328 John Irwin Western classical texts by Theophrastus and Pliny18 where 'sapphire' is the term used to describe the most coveted of all gemstones sought in the ancient world, which later came to be known as 'lapis lazuli'.19 Although lacking common physical qualities other than colour, is it possible that there was considered to be a metaphysical identity between jade, lapis lazuli, and those materials the Chinese included as pi-f° Before answering, the question should be extended to another 18 Theophrastus: De Lapidibus XXXIII. 37; Pliny: Naturalis Historia XXXVIII, 121. 19 The term 'lapis lazuli' was not current anywhere before the European Middle Ages. The etymology generally accepted is from Latin, lapis 'stone', and lazuli , genitive of lazulum, from Arabic (al -)lāzuward &lt; pers. laýward 'lapis lazuli'. The Oxford English Dictionary includes among definitions, 'the colour of the heavenly vault'. Travelling to the West, the same Persian word laýward has given us 'azure'. When lapis lazuli was ground into powder and used as pigment it was called 'lazurite', a term often incorrectly applied to the stone itself. Geolo- gists tell us that retention of lapis is necessary in describing the latter, since the stone is not a simple mineral but a true rock (L. J. Spencer: A key to precious stones. London, 1936, pp. 215-16). In Asia, lapis lazuli had been used as pigment at least from the eighth century A.D. (Josef Riederer: Technik und Farbstoffe der frühmittelalterlichen Wandmalereien Ostturkistans. In: Beiträge zur Indienforschung. Ernst Waldschmidt zum Geburtstag. Berlin 1977. (Veröffentli- chungen des Museums fur Indische Kunst.), pp. 353-422. The often-repeated statement that ancient Egyptian painters used lapis lazuli pigment for 'Egyp- tian Blue' may be a fallacy (see below page 340 and fn. 50) . There is no evidence that the technical difficulty of purifying and concentrating powder derived from the stone was properly mastered before European painters began experimenting about the twelfth century A.D.. Fur further discussion of the pigment aspect, see A. F. Laurie: Identification of pigments used in painting at different periods. In: The Analyst 55 (1930), pp. 162-79; D. V. Thompson: The materials of medieval painting. London 1936; and R. J. Gettens and G. L. Stout: Painting mate- rials: a short encyclopaedia. New edn. New York 1966. Professor Buddruss (see below, fn. 53) thinks that the last word on the etymology of laýward may not yet have been said, seeing that it is the name of the mountain in Badakshan where the mines are located. 20 Another Chinese term deserving closer study is fei-ts'ui which serves double-duty both for jade and for the blue-green of bird plumage, but to avoid further diversion not directly relevant to our study, we refer the reader to a perceptive article by S. Howard Hansford: Jade and the kingfisher. In: Oriental Art 1 (1948), pp. 12-17. There has never existed a sound basis for the assumption of some scholars that liu-li and lapis lazuli were alternative terms for the same substance. This mistaken opinion was effectively refuted by Paul Demiéville in a book review appearing in BEFEO 24 (1924), esp. pp. 276-83. Despite Demiéville' s cogent arguments published more than half a century ago, many modern scholars continue nevertheless to perpetuate old fallacies on the same subject, a recent case in point being Raoul Birnbaum: The Healing</page><page sequence="9">The Lat Bhairo at Benares (Varaņasi) 329 Chinese term, liu-li gft īļ§ Ölt ī$5 ig ï$î which the Sinologist Paul Demiéville desribed as an aphaeresis of the compound pi-liu-li 21 In Buddhist lore, he said, liu-li designated a purely mythical substance distinct from any material which could be fashioned by human hands. In support, he quoted a text of the T'ang period expressing a belief that only demons could fashion objects from this substance and make them available to man. The term is said to have been derived ultimately from Prakrit veluriya and Sanskrit vaidürya which, as we shall see, has often been wrongly equated with lapis lazuli. Again, in Buddhist lore, vaidürya is the name given to the fourth jewel of a cakravartin (= cosmic or 'wheel-' king) and equated with the substance of the cosmic Mount Meru, where it faces mythical Jambudvipa on the south side. If these observations are correct, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that pi and pi-liu-li - both terms used by Chinese Buddhist pilgrims in India to describe the material of Ašokan pillars - were conceived as metaphysically synonymous with jade and lapis lazuli as the ultimate mystical substance of the universe from which, in myth, all life and wealth within it had originally been created. These conclusions had been anticipated half a century ago by Berthold Laufer, whose works have again come to the fore in being re-published in toto in Germany. One of the Laufer sources in discussing the mythi- cal symbolism of jade had been the famous text known as the Chou-li, which he described as 'a state handbook expounding in minute detail the complex organism of the governmental institutes of the Chou emper- ors [1 122 to 252 B. C.]'22 On this basis he concluded that jade in ancient Buddha .

In Laufer's time, the only translation of this text was by Eduard Biot: Le Tcheouli ou Rites de Tcheou. 2 vols. Paris 1851. My colleague John Ayer s of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum cautions me with the warning that some Sinologists consider that the authors of the Chou-li were endeavouring to invest religious ceremonies of their own time with a traditional sanctity not always confirmed by facts - a warning I do not overlook. However, an Indologist will be impressed by the extent to which the rites and beliefs reflected in the Chou-li are reiterated and confirmed by earlier Indian (Vedic) sources - that is, if we accept the hypothesis advanced in this paper that the significance of jade as the cosmogonie or primordial substance of the universe is</page><page sequence="10">330 John Irwin China, disregarded as a stone, had been treated metaphysically as the supreme source of life, consistent with its primordial origin. He also thought that the beliefs on which these ideas had been founded were already partly forgotten by the third century B.C. when the text of the Chou-li was assembled in the form in which it survives. In addition, Laufer concluded that from as early as the preceding Shang dynasty ( 1766 to 1 123 B.C.) - that is, before anthropomorphism was evident in Chinese religion - jadestone had been fashioned into 'pure' or abstract forms as 'altar- stones' to be worshipped as one with the Divine Prin- ciple Itself.23 Only at a later stage in China, he thought, did the jade altar- stone, as object of worship, give place to anthropomorphism and to our concept of 'God' as personalized being. Without offering final judgement on these ideas, one cannot escape the fact that they appear to us to be in harmony with much of the latest information and conclu- sions arising from subsequent investigation into the history of religions. In Laufer' s view, the Chinese originally derived their jadestone from 'natural' deposits in riverbeds. By the third or second century B.C. these, he thought, had mostly been exhausted, with the result that henceforth the search was extended outside China, where jade in the coveted bluish-green colours was rare. * * * Turning now from China to other parts of the world, it has for long been known that in archaic languages the same word commonly served paralleled in ancient India by anthill-clay, as discussed in my paper, The Sacred Anthill and the Cult of the Primordial Mound. In: History of Religions 21 (1982), pp. 339-60. It is significant that jade in ancient China, anthill-clay in Vedic India, and lapis lazuli throughout the Buddhist world and elsewhere, were regarded as having very important medicinal functions. (The Buddhist evidence for lapis lazuli in this connection has recently been brought out by Raoul Birn- baum: The Healing Buddha. Colorado: Shambala Pubi. 1979, pp. 151, though with some confusion and false identification of lapis lazuli with Sanskrit vaidürya- see above fn. 20). In common with other cosmogonie substances (like pearls in some parts of the world, as perceptively grasped by Maurice A. Canne y far ahead of his times in: The life-giving pearl. In: Journal of Manchester Egyptian and Oriental Society 15 [1930], pp. 43-62), all these materials were recommended to be ground into powder and consumed with water by humans wanting to benefit from their life-enhancing properties, intelligible only in the cosmogonie context. 23 B.

Henceforth, he claims,25 the way was open for other deities to be imagined as holding court in the same style. Parallel developments have been independently traced in the Heliopolitan cosmogony of Egypt, where divinity was likewise at first conceived as synonymous with the starry sky, and only later worshipped in anthropomorphic form.26 Similarly, in Greek theogony where Hesiod traced back the ancestry of the gods to constituents like Ouranos (sky) before personali- zation in anthropomorphic form.27 These ideas now acquire new dimension in light of recent discoveries of the eminent palaeontologist, K. P. Oakley, formerly head of the anthropological department at the British Museum of Natural History and Fellow of the Department of Anthropology at University College London. In a number of papers written over the last decade, Oakley has established that palaeolithic man had been a keen collector of fossils in the form of what geologists call 'starry stones'. These fossils 24 E. B.

At that stage, it was a weakness characteristic of evolu- tionary anthropologists that they infused into such ideas a belief in 'nature- worship', thereby missing the more important rôle of cosmogony. 25 W. G. Lambert: The Cosmology of Sumer and Babylon. In: Ancient Cosmo- logies. Ed. by C. Blacker and M. Loewe. London 1975, p. 48. More recently, my colleague, Prof. Parpóla, arrived independently at these ideas in a paper entitled New correspondences between Harappan and Near Eastern glyptic art, deli- vered at the 6th International Conference of South Asian Archaeologists in Western Europe, held at Cambridge in July, 1981 (the Proceedings of which are to be published later this year (1983) under the editorship of R. and B. Allchin, in Cambridge Univ. Press.). Extending the evidence to Vedic myth, Parpóla claims that the Indo-Aryan creator-god, Prajāpati, had originally been identified with the night-sky. Cf.

In his last paper presented to the Royal Society in London just before he died in 1980 and published under the title, Emergence of higher thought 3.0-0.2 Ma B.P.,28 Oakley arrived at the conclusion that from the Mid-Acheulian period, the motivation of this collecting had been aesthetic and unrelat- ed to production. This, he claimed, threw new light on prehistoric conceptual thinking. He also drew the further conclusion that 'art as human behaviour' had emerged before Homo sapiens came into exist- ence - in other words, when Homo erectus was still around - that is, thousands of years before the earliest known rock-paintings hitherto regarded as marking the beginning of Man's creativity, leaving us with the inference that Man was attracted by metaphysical ideas before he became Homo sapiens. This calls for fundamental rethinking of what is ordinarily meant by 'primitivism' and 'progress' in the human context, and the validity of judgements usually based exclusively on technology. Oakley's conclusions raise wider questions about the nature and function of aesthetics in prehistoric society than we feel competent to discuss, but since the answers have no direct bearing on the subject selected for discussion in this paper, we shall leave them aside for others better qualified. Of immediate interest in this context is that Man's obsession from prehistoric times with 'starry stones' appears to have relevance to his much later interest in lapis lazuli as the ultimate Divine Substance. Modern geologists unconcerned with myth or reli- gion lend support to this (albeit unconsciously) by likening the appear- ance of golden pyrites in lapis lazuli to 'the sky bedecked with stars'.29 28 Published in: Philosophical Transactions, Royal Society, London 292 (1981), pp. 205-1 1.

Confirmation that stellar symbolism was already present in the minds of the ancients who acquired lapis lazuli comes from etymology: Sumerian kakJcabānu, literally 'starry', used syno- nymously with ZA.

Howev- er, contradicting those geologists and historians who regard Badakshan as alto- gether unique in this 'impurity', we have to acknowledge that this is not so, although the gold-speckled stone of Badakshan is exceptional and well-known in this respect.

Desautels - formerly Director of the Natural History</page><page sequence="13">The Lat Bhairo at Benares (Varaņasi) 333 At another level, these conclusions can be interpreted as a challenge to modern archaeological thought. Hitherto, archaeologists have based their reconstruction of the past on the material remains left behind by Man. Ideas, embodied in conceptual thought are said not to be determinable by archaeological techniques. The latter, it is said, can only put to test ideas introduced from outside the archaeological discipline. Is it now time to revise that opinion? ♦ * * It has already been noted that the most coveted gemstone in the ancient world was lapis lazuli. The rarity and high cost of this stone can be traced back at least to the middle of the fourth millennium B.C. - that is, when man first acquired wealth and leisure to begin the quest for such luxuries. There had apparently been only one known source in the world of the particular quality of lapis lazuli most sought. Oddly enough, what determined this quality was not - as we shall presently see - a feature natural to the stone but an 'impurity' in its composition. Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D. C., tells me that pyrite is a feature not uncommon in the stone of other areas. The same is confirmed by my colleague Alan Jobbins, gemnologists at the Institute of Geological Science in London, who is of the opinion that the presence or absence of pyrite cannot be taken as infallible proof of origin. Archaeologists, on the other hand, have some- times worked on the assumption that Badakshan was the only known source in antiquity. (See, for instance Georgina Herrmann: Lapis lazuli: the early phase of its trade. In: Iraq, 30 [1968], pp. 21 if. Dr. Herrmann is typical of archaeolo- gists unresponsive to metaphysics in writing to me in a letter after I had sent her a typescript of this paper, 'I myself would never think of lapis lazuli with iron pyrites as looking like "the blue sky bedecked with stars"'. Still more recently, the archaeological picture has been expanded in an important paper by Paul Bernard: Les Mines de lapis lazuli du Badakshan, which is published as Appendix II to Paul Bernard and H. P. Francfort: Études de geógraphie historique sur la plaine d'Ai Khanoum. Paris: Centre national de la recherche scientifique 1978, pp. 49-97.) The early trade is discussed by M.

Yet, this was by no means the sum of the difficulties involved in procuring it, since the most precious kind had to be extracted from the limestone rock by a hazardous process of fire- splitting (the only technique then known), and at altitudes so high above the snow-line (sometimes exceeding 5,000 m.) that the mines were workable for only two months in the year.31 The 'impurity' we have mentioned was the presence in the Badakshan stone of brassy or gold-like pyrites. In later historic times this was regis- tered by Western buyers as an unfortunate defect which reduced the value of the stone, giving it the popular name Tool's Gold'. Throughout the ancient period, however, it had been precisely the presence of this 'impurity' which most excited buyers - not because of an illusory value of the 'gold' but entirely for the religious or symbolic significance attached to the flecking. Seen against the rich, translucent blue of the setting, it suggested to the beholder cosmic expanse of the night- sky. 30 For an excellent introduction, see Paul Bernard: Les mines de lapis lazuli du Badakshan, appearing as Appendix IL to P.

The first European to visit them was probably Captain John Wood in 1837-38, whose description of the technique of extraction shows that it had remained unchanged since antiquity: 'Under the spot to be quarried a fire is kindled, and its flame, fed by dry furze, is made to flicker over the surface. When the rock has become sufficiently soft, it is beaten with hammers, and flake after flake knocked off until the stone of which they are in search is discovered. Deep grooves are then picked out round the lapis lazuli, into which crowbars are inserted, and the stone and part of its matrix are detached.'

For J. W. MacCrindle's rendering of this passage, see his Ancient India as described in classical literature. London 1901, p. 188. An alert reader of this very interesting passage will not miss the testimony of lapis lazuli as ultimate source of life in the universe (in other words, one with primordial matter which they "cut out [of rock- veins] , deriving from it the wherewithal of life". In this passage there is no justification for equating Greek sappheiroio with sapphire of modern geology (see below, fn. 58), as many translatores might do. Ruanos is here Homeric kuanos which alludes not to stone of any kind but to a manufactured glass of the type discussed by Robert Halleux in his seminal paper, mentioned in the same footnote. My friend Prof. Maurizio Taddei, Rector of the Istituto Universitario Orientale, Naples, after drawing the attention of his colleague Prof. Giovanni Cerri to this passage, has passed on the following information about Dionysius Periegetes, who is said to have frequently plagia- rised Apollonius Rhodius (3rd cent. B.C.). The former's report on the Arriani was apparently written while keeping an eye on Apollonius' s Argonautica , 2, 1003-1008, in which the latter says that the Calibi - celebrated as discoverers of iron - practised neither agriculture nor cattle-breeding. Instead, the Calibi are described as drawing their means of subsistence from the mining and trading in iron. Likewise, says Dionysius, the Ariani lived in arid and sandy land, the subsoil of which was rich in precious stones, from the mining of which they derived their livlihood. In this light, there cannot be any doubt that Dionysius gave to words like biotēsion and õonon a purely economic value. This conclusion, however, should not in my opinion be allowed to obscure the fact that archaic traditions recognised no distinction between the earth as source of all kinds of 'treasure/wealth/prosperity' - material and spiritual.

A continental European may call to mind a famous passage in Immanuel Kant's Kritik der praktischen Vernunft: 'Zwei Dinge erfüllen das Gemüt mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je öfter und anhaltender sich das Nach- denken damit beschäftigt: der bestirnte Himmel über mir und das moralische Gesetz in mir. Beide darf ich nicht als in Dunkelheit verhüllt, oder im Überschwenglichen, außer meinem Gesichtekreise suchen und bloß vermuten: ich sehe sie vor mir und verknüpfe sie unmittelbar mit dem Bewußtsein meiner Existenz.'36 An Englishman most readily thinks of Shakespeare, who not infre- quently drew on images of cosmic religion to reinforce his poetic message, and never with greater power than the famous lines marking the dramatic climax of Othello , (I, 2, 1-5), when the Moorish general declaims beneath the night-sky: "It is the Cause, it is the Cause, my soul, Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars: It is the Cause ..." cited by a modern scholar37 unfamiliar with archaic myth as achieving the greatest height of poetic inspiration. An Indian may think first of dharma , the specifically Indian concept of Cosmic Law, to which we shall presently return. The decisive fact is that the numinous associa- tions of the starry heavens were universally expressed in all cultural traditions from earliest times. One could fill several anthologies without a single repetition, yet, lest it be thought that only literate or sophisti- cated cultures have drawn on this inspiration, a parallel example will be 35 Paul Pelliot: Notes on Marco Polo. Vol. I. Paris 1959, pp. 59-60. 36 'Two things fill my mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and intensely the reflection dwells on them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. Neither of them ought I to seek as though enve- loped in obscurities, or in exuberances beyond my scope of perception and merely to be surmised; I see them before me and relate them immediately to the consciousness of my existence.' English translation of this difficult German passage was kindly supplied by my friend Horst Meller, professor at the Anglistisches Seminar, University of Heidelberg, who has the advantage of being both a master of the English language and a scholar specializing on the Romantic Movement. 37 Charles Williams: The English poetic mind.

Beyond that heaven was not "space" but only Divine Pres- ence. This finite cosmos, however, was far from being a prison without an opening ... By the very fact of its finite form it served as an icon to be contemplated and transcended . . ."39 * * * An important association we next have to consider is between lapis lazuli and the Mesopotamian Tree of Life in its cultic form as the Kiškanů of Sumerian religion, ritualized by kings in annual New Year celebrations to ensure fertility. Incantations describe the Kiškanů tree as mythically located in the cosmic ocean ( apsu ), with trunk and branches of lapis lazuli.40 Widengren has demonstrated that there was a clear connection between the Kiškanů and the Waters of Life in which it was conceived as standing, the latter being equated in Mesopo- tamia with the Euphrates.41 The Sumerian word for lapis lazuli (za-gin) means literally 'stone of the mountains'. Its colour is described as 'like the very heavens for clearness'.42 Assyriologists trained in the tradition 38 C. P. Mountford: Nomads of the Australian desert. Adelaide 1976, p. 450. 39 S. H.

For instance, one thinks of the well-known bluestone circle at Stonehenge, incorpo- rated at the second stage of construction, after the stone had been brought specially from the Prescelly Mountains in Wales. Significantly, yet without explanation obvious to those awake to developments in the study of ancient religion and its relation to archaic cosmogony, R. J. C. Atkinson has noted that in dryish weather these stones appear bluish-grey, but after rain acquire 'a noticeably blue tinge' (Stonehenge. 1st edn. London 1956, chapter headed 'The Bluestones', pp. 34-6 (the omission of this chapter from the revised 1976 edn. is unexplained). The so-called 'bliiestone Altar' of Stonehenge, now partly buried beneath a trilithon, he thinks may originally have stood 'upright like a pillar' (Stonehenge and Avebury. London: H.M. Stationery Office 1959, p. 18). Also relevant are the numerous 'bluestones' noted by archaeologists as marking the axial centres of European cities like Leiden, Aachen, Mainz, to mention some still in situ after at least a thousand years (in this connection, see Werner Müller: Die heilige Stadt. Stuttgart 1961, especially pp. 199, and plate 14). At a later period we know that blue as the Divine Colour played an important symbolic rôle in Euro- pean religious painting, as evidenced for instance in such details as the treatment of the Virgin Mary's dress by Piero della Francesca (e. g. his famous study of the Pregnant Virgin in the blue dress known as the Madonna del parto in the rustic cemetery near Monterchi, reproduced in colour by Kenneth Clark in the second edition of his monograph on Piero della Francesca.

Like the 'Aéokan pillar' of a much later period - and the Christian stauros or 'Cross' of a still later period (see above, fn. 9) -, the djed was regarded as mythically and metaphysically synonymous with the cos- mic tree, common to many archaic religions. Raised annually at the end of the old year and the birth of the new, the djed pillar was pre-eminently a symbol of Resurrection, ritually re-erected to ensure fertility.46 The Egyptian word for lapis lazuli is hsbd , said to have the same consonantal structure as the place-name Badakshan, though in reverse order; since lapis lazuli is not native to Egypt or its hinterland47, this has led one Egyptologist to suggest that the word might have represent- ed a terminal on the trade route between Egypt and Badakshan, and the limit to which the Egyptians themselves had ventured as traders to obtain the precious raw material.48 However that may be, the likelihood that Badakshan was the ultimate source of all lapis lazuli found in Egypt is underlined by the frequent recurrence of samples containing gold-like pyrites, and the appearance in Egyptian art of images of the 45 Discussed by W.

No proof has been offered. The balance of evidence suggests that the pigment came, not from stone, but from azurite, a carbonate of copper which Theophrastus and others misled everybody into thinking was synonymous with lapis lazuli and also Greek kúanos. However, latest research reinforces the suggestion independently reached that kúanos was in fact azurite - in other words, a pigmented paste or vitreous composition (blue or green) coloured by copper oxides and cobalt.50 Azurite, which played an extremely important part in early religious iconography, was first developed, it seems, by the Egyptians as a substitute for rare and expensive lapis lazuli which was difficult to obtain even by the richest nations of antiquity. India, in common with most - and despite the proximity of Afghanistan - had to be mainly content with bluestone substitutes, of which there were many, one of the best known being turquoise.51 Professor Georg Buddruss, author of a learned paper on the philological aspect of lapis lazuli and the terms used for it in India (and on whose guidance I have leaned for valuable advice), arrived at the conclusion that it was less well known in India52 than in Mesopotamia and Egypt, the principle markets in antiquity.53 He has joined with H. W. Bailey54 in tracing the Sanskrit to rājavarta/ râj apatta borrowed from Persian where it meant literally 'blue stone'. These Sanskrit words should no longer be confused with other Sanskrit terms wrongly interpreted to mean the same. Among the latter are 49 Examples have often been published, e.g. by Maria Weyersberg, op. cit., Pl. 1. 50 For discussion of this evidence, see Robert Halleux, op. cit.

Each of these was used to describe the divine or mythical substance of the uni- verse or cosmogony, which in art was symbolized by the blue lotus.55 It has for long been known that Indian culture in its early stages was integral with West Asian, as Coomaraswamy had pointed out in the brilliant first chapter ('Early Asiatic') in History of Indian and Indone- sian Art.5* To us, it would seem surprising if this situation had not been reflected in colour- symbolism. In fact, it is in this very area - especially where it overlaps with cult-objects like the Tree of Life - that we find the strongest evidence in Indian religious tradition - equally Jain, Buddhist and Hindu. In whatever context, the Indian sacred tree usually retains clear traces of cosmogonie origin. In brahmanic tradi- tion, it re-emerges as the Akçaya-vata or 'Everlasting Figtree', the fig- species being venerated in many parts of the world because of its milk- white sap, widely identified with Divine Semen as the Essence of Life.57 In late medieval Purāņic texts, it is described in terms almost identical with those applied two thousand years earlier to the Sumerian Kiškanū (see above, p. 337). The same can be said of the Bodhi Tree of Bud- dhism, beneath which the Buddha is believed to have achieved Enligh- tenment. This is synonymous with his 'victory' over Māra, which is a reiteration of the cosmogonie 'victory' of Light over Darkness, and Order over Chaos and shares the same colour symbolism.58 In the struc- 55 The cosmogonie symbolism of the lotus and its equation with the Primor- dial Mound of the cosmogony is discussed with textual sources in my paper, The Mystery of the (Future) Buddha's First Words', in: Annali dell'Istituto Orientale di Napoli 41 (1981), pp. 623-660, esp. pp. 640-41. 56 First published in a German translation as many of us remember (Leipzig 1927). 57 The Akçayavata and its symbolism and the symbolism of its milk- or semen-like sap (denoting 'Essence of Life') is more fully discussed in my paper, The ancient pillar-cult at Pray āga: its pre-Asokan origins (cited at fn. 2, above). In Purāņic tradition, the Ak^ayavata is described as 'like a blue umbrella over Prayâga's head'. (Cf. the description of the Sumerian Kiškanū tree, quoted by A. F. Albright: The Mouth of the Rivers.

As if to underline this connection, the pillar had to be ritually fashioned from a sacred tree selected for the purpose.59 We are not surprised to learn from one of the earliest texts dealing with stūpa - construction (Avadãna-éataka VII. 67) that the summital emblem of the axial pillar was called indranīla, which Sanskritists have interpreted naturalistically as 'sapphire'. It is perhaps better understood as another name of the purely mythical stone which was synonymous with the ultimate cosmogonie substance of the universe. Through the magical power of indranīla , says the text, 'the four quarters and the interme- diate directions of space are given the appearance of blue'. This leads us of 'sapphire'. Discussing the etymology of this word, Robert Halleux has written perceptively on Theophrastus's use of the word in De Lapidibus 55, where it clearly alludes to lapis lazuli: 'Les dictionnaires étymologiques grecs (Boisacq, Hoffmann, Frisk) rattachent sappheiros a l'hébreu sappir ou au pheni- cien sapper (cf. E. Masson, Recherches sur les plus anciens emprunts sémitiques en grec , Paris, 1967, p. 66, note 2). Le mot est bien attesté en sémitique au sens de lapis-lazuli (G. Gesenius, Thesaurus philologicus criticas linguae Hebraeae et Chal- daeae Veteris Testamenti, II, 2, Leipzig, 1840, p. 968, s.v. sappir, Hebräisches und Arämaisches Handwörterbuch über das Alte Testament , 17e éd., Berlin, 1915, s.v.). Mais en sémitique même, l'étymologie du mot fait difficulté; il est considéré comme un emprunt au sanskrit (R. Růžička, Konsonantische Dissimilation in den semitischen Sprachen , dans Beiträge zur Assyriologie VT, 4, 1909, p. 130; M. Ellenbogen, Foreign Words in the old Testament , London, 1962, p. 125). Le terme sanskrit allégué est éanipriya, "cher à Saturne", la planète Saturne étant dite nīlavāsas "bleu sombre". Cependant éanipriya n'apparaît qu'au XIXe siècle, dans le Šabdakalpadruma , lexique sanskrit de Rādhākanthadeva. La glose est reprise au Šabdārthakalp atara, lexique manuscrit du début du XIXe. Le mot semble donc reformé à partir d'une langue moderne et ne peut expliquer la forme sémitique.' Robert Halleux, op. cit., p. 60, note 68. This excursus should not be allowed to divert us from the obvious difficulties attending any interpretation of the Mahãvamáa in the sixth-century form it is handed down to us, and notwithstanding the older, misunderstood sources from which it apparently draws. There is no doubt that in the mind of the sixth-century author, indanīla refers to a mythical substance of the same order as the Bluestones earlier discussed, and closely associated in tradition with the axis mundi and the Tree on the cosmogonie mound, which was rooted in the cosmic waters. In this connection, see my paper, Buddhism and the Cosmic Pillar, now awaiting publica- tion in the Felicitation Volume in honour of Professor Guiseppe Tucci on his 90th Birthday. Ed. by Prof. Gherardo Gnoli, President of the Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, Rome, for presentation on June 5th, 1984, where the realtionship between Axis Mundi, Tree, and Pillar is discussed at length.

The purpose seems to have been to give worshippers the impression of treading the cosmic ocean as they circumambulated.60 Azure-blue colours again recur in medieval Buddhist painting, where they are used, for instance, to depict the 'ground of heavenly paradise.'01 So far, in discussing the divine or celestial colour, emphasis has been placed on tones of blue and bluish-green, although, as we have seen, nineteenth-century translators of Chinese texts describing Ašokan pillars have often been confused or inconsistent about whether the celestial colour should be called blue or green or something between the two. The ambiguity often seems deliberate, reminding us that cultures sometimes draw distinctions between colours in different ways and not necessarily in the European one.62 One thing we can be certain about: 60 For illustrations and discussion, see my paper The Stūpa and the Cosmic Axis: the archaeological evidence. In: South Asian Archaeology 1977. Ed. by M.Taddei. Naples 1st. Univ. Orientale 1979, esp. pp. 837-43. The same symbol- ism occurs in Tibet: my colleague Philip Denwood tells me that the seventh- century King srong-btsan sgam-po , after seeing the temple built by his Nepalese queen at Lhasa, mistook the blue-coloured floor of the temple for the actual waters of the lake over which it had been built, claiming that he even saw fish, birds and acquatic animals swimming about! 61 Robert Jera-Bezard and Monique Maillard: Un Paradis d'Amitābha de la collection Aurel Stein conservé au Musée national de New D&lt; Ihi.

The painting illustrates a text of the Amitâyurdhyãna- sūtra now surviving only in Chinese translation from the original Sanskrit, now lost (this information was kindly provided by Prof. Buddruss in a letter. Signif- icantly in this context, this Chinese word rendered from the original Sanskrit as lapis lazuli was liu-li, sometimes transliterated liao-liu, now no longer consid- ered as synonymous (see above, fn. 20). The original Sanskrit word is more likely to have been vaidurya (also wrongly equated by many Sanskritists with lapis lazuli, and therefore encouraging the Chinese-English translator of the text to mislead everybody in the version published in Sacred Books of the East, vol. XLIX, part II, pp. 161-201, as quoted, for instance, by the French scholars above. 62 The confusion is implicit in colour-photography. I have frequently photo- graphed Ašokan pillars in situ, only to find that the same pillar, photographed at different times of the same day and in different light conditions, sometimes appears bluish, sometimes greenish. This should caution us about accepting too readily the theories that confusion among Asiatics was the result of certain inborn limitations of the eye-retina - a theory advanced in scientific terms by P. D. Trevor-Roper: The influence of eye disease on pictorial art. In: Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine 52 (1959), pp. 739 ff., but inviting scepticism</page><page sequence="24">344 John Irwin the subject is deeper and more complicated than purely visual impres- sions suggest. We have already noted (see above p. 327) in archaic traditions a close interfusion between colour and materials; likewise, we should not ignore an even more complicated relationship between colour and religious meaning which remains to be fully investigated. This becomes especially obvious in the three-cornered relationship between blu e , the Axis Mundi, and notions of ascension to the celestial sphere63. Returning to descriptions of Ašokan pillars by the medieval Chinese pilgrims in India, it is worth noting that the shaft of the pillar seen by Hsüan-Tsang at Vārāņasī was said to have been '. . . . bright and shin- ing, its surface glistening and smooth as ice . . ,'.64 He goes on to say that visible within the shaft could be seen the figure of the Buddha appearing like a 'shadow'. In this interesting passage we recognize an allusion to what archaeologists call 'Maury an polish' in referring to the highly finished surface over which the lettering of Aáoka's edicts were engraved. Gazing into this mirror-like surface, the worshipper could have seen his own reflection; inspired by faith, he would no doubt have seen this reflection as an image of the Buddha. This reminds us of words Paul Mus placed in the Master's mouth when explaining what consti- tuted the essence of Buddhist image-worship: 'Whoever sees the Law among some art historians. For instance, this theory is discounted by Philip Denwood who tells me that Tibetans - sometimes accused of failing to recog- nize a difference between blue and green (because they use one word, sngon-po, for the colour of grass and of the sky) do in fact have a separate word for 'green' which they also use. See also the perceptive study by S. Howard Hansford (op. cit., above fn. 18) on the Chinese word fei-ts'ui. 63 For instance, it has been noticed that blue is commonly associated with the branches of the cosmic tree or Tree of Life in many traditions (see above p. 337) ; similarly, in architectural symbolism, pillars in temples, churches and palaces are often described either as blue or made of lapis lazuli. No less significantly, blue is associated with hair ornament and jewellery worn in Mesopotamia as head-ornament (see Edward Schafer: The Golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of T'ang exotics. Berkeley and Los Angeles 1963, pp. 230-33 for many references); nor should we neglect Chinese Buddhist tradition that says the Buddha 'had hair of the colour of Lapis-lazuli' (Pelliot, pp. cit., p. 69). For similar references in other archaic cultures to the hair of deities as 'blue' or 'made of lapis lazuli', see especially Robert Halleux öited above (fn. 50) who refers to many sources, including G. Contenau: Manuel d'archéologie orientale. Tome II., p. 768. The same usage is found in pre-Achaemenid Persia, as mentioned by E. Porada: Alt-Iran. Baden-Baden 1966, p. 157 and p. 279. For a suggested explanation see C. Picard: Manuel d'archéologie grecque. Tome I, p. 136, n. 1; and G. Germain: Genèse de l'Odyssé. Paris 1954, p. 153, n. 2. 64 Quoted from the translation by S.

The use of the pillar in this way dispels the common fallacy of the cosmic pillar as 'symbol': instead, we see it as one with dharma - a notion Buddhism appears to have taken from earlier cosmic religion. It is relevant at this stage to note that Hsüan-Tsang's reference to reflections seen in the pillar at Vārāņasī recurs in only slightly different form in his description of an Ašokan lion-pillar, now no longer existing, at Sañklsa.66 After referring to figures seen by the faithful in the pillar, he then goes on to say that these either appear or disappear 'according to whether men are good or bad'.67 Two centuries earlier (405-417 A.D.), another pilgrim, Fa-Hsien, had described the figures in other yet, for us, still more meaningful terms. Be al, in his 1864 translation68 rendered the Fa-Hsien passage as follows: 'Within the 65 Paul Mus: Barabudur. Esquissed'une histoire du Bouddhisme fondée sur la critique archéologique des textes. Hanoi 1935, p. 652. I believe a parallel notion can be traced in Christian tradition for instance in a long-misunderstood passage in the Oxyrinchus papyrus of about 120 A.D., in words spoken by Jesus but omitted from the orthodox canon: wEyei[p]ov tòv Aáúõ, xáxeT eí)pf|oeiç ļie* o^ioov to £úXov, xàyà) èxeí eiļii. "Raise the stone, and there shalt thou find me; Cleave the wood, and there am I." Biblical scholars have hitherto favoured a pantheisitic interpretation of these words, reducing the message to something flat and prosaic. Jeremias, for instance, ignored the poetry and rendered it, 'You will And me through the heavy labour of breaking stones, and of hewing wood', which are words hardly distinguishable from modern bourgeois veneration for work! It is only when we recognize 'stone' and 'wood' as terms alluding to the World Pillar/Tree of cosmic religion, that the passage makes sense. I am preparing for publication a separate exegesis on this important, yet long-misunderstood utterance by Jesus. 66 For discussion on the long-standing confusion between the pre-Asokan (brahmanical) elephant and bull-pillars, and the Asokan (Buddhist) lion-pillar known from literary evidence to have once existed at the same ancient city (yet now vanished) , see Part II of my Burlington series cited above at fn. 5, where the elephant-capital is studied, esp. p. 725.

The Chinese word used by Fa-Hsien for lapis lazuli is liao li which H. A. Giles, in his 1923 translation of the same work,69 rendered by the uncommon term 'strass', defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, as 'a vitreous composition used as a basis in the manufacture of artificial paste in the making of gemstones for jewellery', named after its eigh- teenth-century German inventor, Josef Strasser.70 It is evident that if 'strass' was a nineteenth-century invention and that the word did not exist in the ancient world, this could not be an accurate rendering of liao-li, which is the term used by Fa-Hsien to describe the material of the Aáokan lion-pillar seen at Sankīsa. Nevertheless, Giles's associa- tion of liao-li with 'strass' can be interpreted as throwing important light on a large range of artificial pastes or 'stones' of the ancient world coloured 'blue' or 'bluish-green', and including Egyptian faience and Greek kúanos both of which we now know to have been vitreous compo- sitions commonly used as substitutes for the most coveted and costly of all gemstones - lapis lazuli! Whether we think of the stone in which Aáokan pillars were carved as resembling 'strass' or 'glass', there is little doubt that the 'figures of the Buddha' which 'appear or disappear in the pillar according to whether men are good or bad', were not actual carvings, either in relief or in the round, as often interpreted (e.g. by Be al and Watters), but mirror-like reflections on the surface, which worshippers commonly experienced as one with the cosmic pillar itself.71 69 H.

Kraus and C. B. Slawson: Gems and gem materials. New York 1947, pp. 160 and 197. The authors describe it as a special kind of imitation- glass or -stone 'with relatively high indices of refraction and strong dispersion [of reflection] . . . commonly used in Europe to imitate diamond: 300 parts of quartz, 470 of red lead, 163 of potassium carbonate, 22 of borax, and 1 of white arsenic.

Recalling the well-known words of St. Paul in Corinthians 13. 12 ('For now we see through a glass darkly . . .'), he comments to me in a letter (which I have permission to quote) that in early times, when mirrors were less clear in reflection, 'on voyait "confu- sément", ce qui laissait à l'imagination une large possibilité de préciser ce qu'on croyait voir en l'interprétant à sa guise.

This traveller was a lapidary, whose special interest was gem-cutting, for which the city has remained famous up to the present day. His reference appears as follows: "About 500 paces from the town, stretching to the north-west [my pacing, J. I.] there is a mosque where one sees many sculptures of the Mohammedans, some of which are very beautiful architecture. The most beautiful are each in the centre of a garden enclosed by walls, which have openings of half a foot square, through which passers-by have a view [of the mosque]. The largest of all is like a great square pedestal, each face of which is about 40 steps long. In the centre of this platform can be seen a column [i. e. the Lāt Bhairo], 32 to 35 feet in height, all of one piece . . ."72 Why did Tavernier locate the pillar to the north-west of the city, when our plan at fig. 1. shows that it stood to the north-east? The explanation lies in the fact that the focus of his interests was in the arti- san-quarters, where the lapidaries worked. At that time their work- shops would have been concentrated in what was then the commercial part of the city, which coincided with the area now known as Rājghāt. It is only since the seventeenth century that Rājghāļ has been depopu- lated, leaving a tongue of high somewhat barren land which recent archaeological excavation has proved to have been occupied until the 18th century with many traces of Islamic culture.73 Standing in the area les voyantes qui "lisent l'avenir" dans les figures qui leur apparaissent dans une boule de cristal ou dans les taches de marc de café . . .'.In the present context, Bareau interprets the Chinese literally, as claiming that the pillar-shaft had been actually sculpted with images of the Buddha. This seems to me unlikely, especially in the absence of any archaeological evidence. The passages make good sense only if we accept 'les figures' as applying to reflections in the polished surface. 72 Jean-Baptiste Tavernieri Six voyages de J-B. T. . . . Paris 1676.

In: Art and Archaeology Research Papers 17 (1980), pp. 41-46. According to M. C. Sher- ring (op. cit., p. 305), the Lāt Bhairo stands 'about a short mile' from Rājghāt 'fort', The earliest reference to it being called a 'fort' appears (as far as I know) in James Prinsep's map of Vārāņasī dated 1823 (a copy is preserved in the India Office Library, London (Press mark). Today the city of Vārāņasī spreads further to the west, most of its architecture dating only from the period of Islam- ic rule, whereas remains of the ancient city survive as rubble even to the east of the river Varaņa (see M. C. Sherring, p. 34).</page><page sequence="28">348 John Irwin of Rājghāt, and looking towards the present position of the Lāt Bhairo, Tavernier would have been correct in describing its location to the north-west, and 'in the centre of a platform' (the latter we earlier equated with the terrace in the photograph at fig. 4). The shaft, he wrote, was so large in diameter that 'three men could only with diffi- culty embrace it'. Looking at the stone in which it was carved with the close observation of a lapidary, he remarked that it was so hard that the surface could not be scratched with his knife. This fits the nature of the fine-grained, metallic-looking sandstone, used for all so-called 'Aáokan' pillars. The shaft terminated, he wrote, 'dans un pyramid avec une grosse boule'. If we take 'boule' in the sense defined by old French dictionaries as 'global or spherical water-pot', we recognize here the equivalent of a Hindu kaloša , a familiar summital emblem in both Hindu and Islamic architecture. This recalls the kalasa shown on top of the Allahabad pillar when sketched by Captain James Ho are in the 1790s, and reproduced in my paper on that monument.74 Tavernier further describes the capital as encircled by 'gros grains'. If we read this as 'large beads' these strange words must surely refer to conventional, so-called 'bead-and-reel' ornament. This is another feature also known to have been incorporated in the Allahabad capital, and assumed by art historians to have been evidence of Greek influence in India. Elsewhere, I have demonstrated that 'bead-and-reel' was not a Greek invention and had already reached India before the Greeks, when it was already established as a convention of West Asian art.75 We can also see 'bead-and-reel' as another feature suggesting that the Lāt Bhairo had elements in common with the Allahabad pillar, now proved beyond reasonable doubt to have been a pre-Aáokan bull-pillar, already standing when Aáoka came to the throne. A good prima facie case therefore exists for suggesting that the Lāt Bhairo was also erected before Aéoka's time. What we finally have to consider is whether independent evidence exists to link the Lāt Bhairo with pre-Buddhist, brahmanical tradition. Here the evidence is decisive. We find it embodied in a report issued by 74 Hoare's sketch, first published in Asiatic Researches 7 (1801), is repub- lished at fig. 4 in my paper on the Prayâga pillar (see above, cited at fn. 1). 75 Reproduced at fig. 7 (a) in the same Prayâga paper (cited above, fn. 1). The only authentically Aáokan pillar perpetuating the pre-Hellenistic 'bead-and- reel' motif is the one at Lauriya Nandangarh.

The report is based on evidence given by leaders of both the Hindu and Muslim communities of the city, yet was not published until half a century later. The fact that it has escaped the attention of historians may be explained by the fact that in the meantime the terms in which the information is couched must have been regarded by most people as unintelligible. Today, however, any historian of religions cognisant with pillar- worship in other parts of the world is likely to recognize the meaning as clear. The Muslim witnesses described with most utmost contempt the custom of pillar- worship, insisting erroneously that it had no sanction even in Hindu scriptures. 'The style of Hindu worship is this . . . Whenever they [the Hindus] set up a pillar they call it, at the incitement of their priests, a place of worship of the highest sanctity . . . Only when all persons acquainted with the truth are dead will the pillar then be honoured with the name of Mahadeo [Šiva] or Brahma. It is just so at Benares . . .' Yet, in the same context they admit that the Lāt Bhairo was worshipped by Muslims as well as by Hindus [both said to be 'of the lower orders'] with agreement to divide the offerings between them. This worship they describe as being in annual celebration of the pillar's 'marriage'.76 The report is revealing in a number of ways. In the first place it testi- fies that pillar- worship was enjoined as a rite by members of both Hindu and Muslim communities until as late as the nineteenth century. It also shows that it was performed in the name of the highest deities. In my interpretation this means that sacred pillars were regarded as one with the Highest Principle of the Divine, as indicated in the Vedas in terms often misunderstood by textual scholars.77 Thirdly, it indicates that the festivals associated with this worship celebrated the pillar's 'marriage' : what, precisely, does that mean? Nobody who has studied pillar- wor- ship in the ancient world should feel the least doubt. Wherever such evidence survives - whether in worship of Vedic skambha, Sanskrit stambha, Celtic Irmensul, Dorian Agyieus, or Greek stauros (later assimi- lated to the Christian Cross-cult) - the same sacred pillar or stake was also worshipped in phallic form as symbol of regeneration or resurrec- tion.

Annual re-enactment of this 'victory' was the most important event in the prehistoric religious calendar, its purpose being to revitalize nature and the social order at the end of each year. In this ritual, heaven and earth were imagined as coming together after initial separation to consummate and to produce life on earth78 as the universal parents (Sanskrit janitrï), the archetypal bridal pair. At the folk-level, which the report equates with the level of the 'lower orders', the pillar symbolized the generative organ with which Father Heaven inseminated Mother Earth. This was an aspect of the universal cosmo- gony which centuries of suppression by the 'higher religions' never enti- rely succeeded in obliterating. Lastly, how do we reconcile the Lāt Bhairo with the cult of Šiva as Bhairava, the deity in his terrifying aspect as 'the formidable, terrifying one', who deals out punishment, instills fear into the hearts of trans- gressors, and drives away demons from the threshhold, while attracting worship in the form of the lingai For final answer we must be patient until more research has been done.79 The cult is hybrid and complex. One clue may rest in the name of the Kapilamochan tank at the same site, perhaps a corruption concealing association with the extinct Šai vi te sect known as the Kāpālikas; but there are also other strands of archaic religion which may not have come together until relatively recent times, after the meaning was already partly lost. Among them we recognize Bhairava as god of the boundary who (as in the case of the 78 A description of Heaven and Earth as the archetypal married pair to consummate and produce life on earth appears in Aitreya BrahmaņaV II. 27.

A more archaic conven- tion we recognize in the worship of him as daņdpan - the club or stick of divine retribution - indicative of the way in which rustic deities were brought into 'higher religion'.81 Does this also help to explain his worship as kotwal or policeman-magistrate82 and his important role in rites of orientation, too readily attributed to Islamic influence? Although the earliest attested use of the term kotwäl is an Arabic source of about 1040 A.D., scholars have recently been arguing in favour of earlier Indo-Aryan or Dravidian derivation.83 We should not lose sight of the fact that Bhairo' s policeman-identity prevailed widely in India long before the abolition of the hereditary post of village-policeman in 1 864. It is evident for instance, in the important cult of Aiyanar as Guard- ian deity of South Indian villages, who is also known as Šāsta, liter- ally 'ruler, governor, punisher'.84 Perhaps we come closest to the religi- 80 On the relationship between boundary gods like Hermes and phallicism, see Wolfgang Wickler: Social-sexual signals and their interspecific imitation among primates.

Along its borders, the cosmos is threatened by these malevolent powers which, although driven away from this world into the darkness of the netherworld, cons- tantly return to imperil its existence. In psychological terms, this myth might express a regression of the dark aspects of existence into the unconscious mind, inducing - as a natural consequence - fears engen- dered by that repression. In his penetrating study, Varuria and Vidūsaka (Verhand. der Koninkl. Nederi. Akad. van Wetensch. 1979), F. B. J. Kuiper has written of a supreme conception of the Divine that has devoured and assimilated the demonic, and who is also Rudra and Agni. To the younger generation of to-day, it is hardly conceivable that a policeman could be worshipped as 'god': he is more likely to be seen as the Devil Incarnate! Yet, in the cosmogonie context, the association makes sense. Even in Western Europe, there has never been anything strange about the sanctity of punishment, especially when viewed as a manifestation of Divine Retribution, as the terrible history of the Roman Catholic Inquisition makes plain. Even more pertinent is the ancient association of the 'Cross of Salva- tion' with its traditional location at the crossroads or axes of our settle- ments, at which spot the cult of the stauros was located long before the Church Fathers associated it with the Crucifixion. Hence, the cult of the so-called 'Cross' was traditionally located at the spot where tribal justice had formerly been administered. Stocks, whipping-posts, and other instruments of correction had once existed even beside Crucifixes, and they did not always disappear with the Reformation however strongly Christian conscience turned against pagan remnants. Traces survive on some of our village greens up to the present day, though seldom explained in any religious context.85 In ancient times, the common thief, the cheater in the market-place, and the man whose word cannot be trusted are each in their own way agents for the return of the world to chaos, and therefore a threat to social order. Since, throughout the ancient world, social order was but an aspect of divine or cosmic order, it could best be preserved at the Sacred Centre or Axis of the Universe, where order was originally 'created'. 85 For illustrations, see especially J.
