<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Relevance of the Old Testament Today MURIEL STREIBERT CURTIS MUCH OLD TESTAMENT scholarly work of late years has been concerned with the minutiae of particular passages, or at most with the sources and prob- lems of individual books. It is time that we should consider the larger meanings of the Old Testament, what it stands for, in what direction it points, lest if and when the secular world, dismiayed with its failure to achieve even tolerable human re- lationships, should be ready to turn to the Bible for guidance, we Biblical students might have no help to give. How can one treat such a comprehen- sive subject as the relevance of the Old Testament today in a brief paper? The Old Testament is a library. To bring or- der or coherence into one's understanding of "today" another library would be neces- sary. But in spite of the many differing conceptions of God and His demands of men, there are some points of view that do characterize Old Testament religion, es- pecially on its higher levels, from the age of Amos on. We shall concern ourselves with these and have in mind the relevance of the Old Testament for one who has understood and made his own the spirit of the Old Testament as suggested (neces- sarily without argument) in the seven statements that follow. Again, we must narrow "today" rather arbitrarily to certain special conditions, trends of thought, dan- gers and opportunities which the writer is convinced we are facing or shall probably soon face. Naturally much that is sug- gested here as representing the point of view of the Old Testament is carried farth- er or made more persuasive in the New Testament. I The Old Testament is sure that God is important, more important than any other factor in life, that He, indeed, does not rank with other factors, for He dominates and determines them all. God is real to men of the Old Testament, is active, is effec- tive, is always to be taken into account. This holds true through all the stages of their thought, however they conceive of God's nature and character. The recogni- tion of God, the orientation of thought and action to God, which is the basic requisite for religious living, stands out on every page of the Old Testament. Whether one turns to law, narrative, prophecy or poetry, one finds men rememnbering God or being repri- manded by their leaders for failing to do so.* The typical Hebrew felt awe and rever- ence for God and offered Him homage. The typical modern man does not. Said a col- lege student, "What is this reverence you talk about? I never felt reverence for any- thing or anybody." Multitudes who might not express their feeling so baldly, still do not know from their own experience what worship means, for our civilization has be- come predominantly secular, more impressed by the wonders of science than by the thought of God, more desirous of securing the things which the application of science has made possible than of doing the will of the Lord. The Old Testament is relevant if it offers something which a "this-worldly" age needs, whether or not the age has yet become conscious of its need. That there are signs of such a beginning conscious- *The Song of Songs and the book of Esther in their original meanings, though not in their later interpretations, are probably exceptions to this statement, as are many proverbs, (those from what Prof. Pfeiffer calls the secular school) unless one supposes that the wisdom writers con- tinually took for granted that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"). 81</page><page sequence="2">82 MURIEL STREIBERT CURTIS [May ness, signs of a "religious awakening" the modern Habakkuks in their watch-towers report. The fact that even the Nazis have introduced a certain kind of cult and sym- bolism and that they invoke the old pagan gods shows how natural it is for us human beings to rely on a "power not ourselves." In the Old Testament this "power not ourselves" is ethical, though irrational mani- festations occasionally appear in the earlier accounts. It may be hard at times for men to see that God is acting righteously, but there is confidence that if man were capable of completely understanding God, man would be completely satisfied as to God's justice. At least it is possible so to inter- pret the author of Job. Because God is righteous He insists that men shall be. The fact that the Old Testa- ment so steadily links religion and ethics, the fact that standards for men's ways of life and the motivation of men's efforts are not merely social, but are definitely relig- ious, is exceedingly significant for us. The break-down of the whole secular fabric in our day, the disintegration and disunity of France which made her such an easy prey for the Germans, are showing to many the need of mankind for spiritual unity and a higher control than that of mere human standards. The very challenge which Naz- ism and Fascism have presented to secular- ism in their bold departure from such previ- ously widely-accepted ideals as humanitari- anism and freedom of speech has raised the question of what sanctions there are for ideals beyond the preferences of one group or another. We are hearing much of ideologies. The Nazis have won their in- credible support from multitudes not only in their own land but in others, in part because they have linked action to authorita- tive beliefs. So must we, and to sounder ones, if we are to compete with them, if our ideals are to be compelling. Deeds and dogma belong together. "It would seem that in the long run, man cannot live by ideals alone, but only on some reality on which ideals can feed," says John M. Baillie. Techniques for carrying out ideals we must learn from other sources than religion, but the root and vitality of ideals derive from religion. In showing time and again and in multi- tudes of ways that God is good, that He is just and merciful, the Old Testament writers invest the conception of God with meaning and reality. A college student said that the main contribution of her Old Testament study lay just here, that whereas she had previously been convinced that she must give up her childish pictures of a God who was immensely real to her, and had felt that there was nothing left but a vague abstraction who mattered very little, she now has gained a conception of a God who was wholly spiritual but richly mean- ingful. She could again put some content into her thought of God. Many today are in need of just that help. To be sure, one must be accustomed to and not be misled by the vivid, concrete, pic- torial manner of speech of the Bible, or many statements about God will seem too crudely anthropomorphic to appeal to mod- ern minds; for example, in Amos 9 the Lord says, "I will slay the last of them with the sword; there shall not one of them flee away.... Though they dig into hell, thence shall my hand take them and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. Though they hide them- selves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent and it shall bite them." I have had stu- dents say that that passage was repellent to them. One even called it nauseating. It seems to them to present a picture of God as a superman, vindictively striking out at scurrying animals and saying, "Ill get you yet." But when I have asked students whether they believe that men can outwit God and by clever human schemes escape His justice, they do not.</page><page sequence="3">1943] THE RELEVANCE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 83 "Oh, if that is what Amos is saying, it's all right!" III The Old Testament knows that the will and control of God are seen in history, but that important choices are left to man, so that both God and man play significant parts in determining history. What hap- pened to men and nations was not a mat- ter of chance and was not solely dependent on size of armies or wealth, equipment and prestige of peoples, but was related to the will of God and was a revelation of His character. This belief is evident through- out the Old Testament, from the astonish- ing rescue of the harried little group trying to escape from Egypt through to the phi- losophy of world history in the book of Daniel. That this belief was not an easy one to hold when things were going hardly with the Hebrew armies or nation is evi- denced by the stubborn incredulity of the men with whom Isaiah and Jeremiah labor- ed. But the best of them knew that it was so, knew that they could not accept the assurance of God's concern for them as seen in the crossing of the Red Sea and ignore the rebuke and warning of Sen- nacherib's or Nebuchadrezzar's attacking hordes. "Ho, Assyria, rod of mine anger! . . Against the people of my wrath I give him a charge" was as potent a message as that "By a mighty hand and an out- stretched arm" they had been led "out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bond- age." They knew that the right interpreta- tion of what happened was as important as the circumstances themselves and that if they could understand events aright they would learn basic truths about the God of history. They knew that in deciding what steps they should take in dealing with other nations they ought to turn to God for guidance lest for example, in going to Egypt for help they might be "carrying out a plan which is not mine." They knew also that while God might warn and exhort them through the prophets, He would not force them. They were free, but they were deciding real, not make-believe issues and the consequences of their actions would be writ large for all men to see-writ in his- tory. They could disregard the will of God, but not with impunity. There was something fixed and rock-like in the will of God. If a nation defied it, a nation could be wrecked as on a rocky reef. A God of character and power had made a world which would not permanently tolerate de- fiance of His principles. It was God's world into which men were born, not one of their own making and they must adjust themselves to it, not expect it to adjust itself to them. In relating these insights to our day, we must again not be thrown off the track by the Biblical pictorial manner of speech, nor by the Hebrew belief in the directness and immediacy of God's interventions in human affairs, which seems almost naive to modern thought. In Is. 5:25 Yahweh raises a signal and whistles or hisses for a distant nation to come on as His agent of judgment. (Perhaps such a passage raises a question- Was it just pictorial manner of speech? Did the prophet believe that every move- ment of troops, every advance and retreat of armies was directly responsive to the will of the Lord? If so, are we agreed in saying that is impossible for modern thought? When the Germans went into Greece, did the Lord take them in ?) We must get down to the basic tenets of He- brew belief and consider whether their insights are still pertinent. To many it is only these insights that can clear up the con- fusion of thought which is evident today when men try to relate the idea of God to the chaos, ferocity and misery of a world at war. For some, however, confusion is yielding to penitence, complacency is break- ing down, pride and self-sufficiency are being humbled because they are hearing the word of God through the prophets of Israel. As a college sophomore said, after</page><page sequence="4">84 MURIEL STREIBERT CURTIS [May studying the messages of Amos and Isaiah to the Hebrews, "We are those people." IV The kingdom of God will come. God's purpose of good for men will ultimately be achieved. Though this purpose was dif- ferently understood in varying ages, there was always confidence that the best was yet to be, that the Golden Age lay in the future, not in the past. The Hebrews were always1 "prisoners of hope," a hope which delivered them from devastating or long-continued doubt. Doubt was a stepping stone, not a resting place, for Hebrew, in contrast to Babylonian and Egyptian thinkers. (Ko- heleth was not a typical Hebrew in this respect. The contrast between Ecclesiastes and all other Biblical books shows clearly what the characteristic Biblical attitude was.) The fact that (in the later centuries at least) the full fruition of men's hopes was placed "beyond history" and that God was the chief actor in bringing this about, saved the Hebrews from cynicism at times when the effort of men seemed to accomplish little and when the years went on and on, freighted with the old load of human mis- eries and sin. Many today are convinced that the Hebrews saw aright here, that our dreams of the brave new world we will build after this war is over are doomed to disappointment, that we can never have a real Utopia without Utopian men as its in- habitants and that there is no reason to think that human nature is going to be radically changed. Some recognized abuses we can and must do away with to be sure, some old wrongs can be righted, but human greed and pride, human indifference to the needs of others if our own needs are being met, will continue and find new means of expression in the generations to come. So if we are not to be swamped by a wave of cynicism when the fruits of all our efforts and self-sacrifice in this war are weighed and found less than we had anticipated, we must fortify ourselves in advance by this Biblical recognition that men can only pre- pare themselves for the Kingdom, not achieve it. Of course the fear is often expressed that such teaching leads to passivity, to easy justification for inertia, to acceptance of wrongs that could and should be righted by determined and vigorous human en- deavor. We certainly must not let the apocalyptists drown out the voices of the eighth-century prophets crying, "Seek jus- tice, relieve the oppressed, vindicate the orphan, plead for the widow." Wisdom and relevancy are to be found in both groups of counsellors. There is a challenge in the oft-reiterated injunction to "trust in the Lord." We need to keep reconsidering the problem of what we can trust the Lord to do and what He is trusting us to do. But there would be today a more general agree- ment than would have been possible some years ago that nren have relied too ex- clusively on their own powers and have overlooked the abysses in human nature which furnish shaky foundations for any building which rests on man alone. The Old Testament with its confidence in the Lord furnishes a much needed corrective. V Another characteristic of the Old Testa- ment approach to life is a deep satisfac- tion in the things of the spirit. Learning and doing the will of God, thanking Him, praising Him, trusting Him, reflecting on Him and His ways with men, communing with Him, bring genuine and lasting joy which is not linked to earthly possessions and good fortune. To be sure, it was long thought that good fortune would be the re- sult of faith and obedience, but when the facts of life riddled the doctrine of retribu- tion, some of the Hebrews at least learned that spiritual joys had their own inde- pendent existence and were able to say, "Though the fig tree shall not flourish, neither shall the fruit be in the vines . . .</page><page sequence="5">1943] THE RELEVANCE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 85 yet will I rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation." Jeremiah and the book of Psalms furnish countless illus- trations of this experience. The attitude was maintained without any tendency to- ward asceticism. The folly of heaping up this world's goods, the bad effect of need- less luxuries on the character of the pos- sessor, and the unhealthiness in group life of extremes of wealth and poverty were recognized (emphatically in Amos, Isaiah and Micah) but the Hebrews seem never to have concluded that deliberate depriva- tions, vows of poverty, mortification of the flesh, had any positive values in the religious life. Instead they rejoiced in "the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof" as well as in the "good-will of Him that dwelt in the bush." (One recalls the Rechabites, but their vows and renuncia- tions had a special motivation, which dif- ferentiates them from the ascetics of other religions.) Putting it all together, one can understand how C. G. Montefiore could write, "A marked characteristic of the Old Testament is joy." Surely such a religion is relevant for a people who find themselves losing the old comforts or enduring actual privations and obliged to face a future in which for a long time the restoring of the basic necessities to the many will have to take precedence of comforts for the few. One imbued with the Old Testament spirit must feel that he can let luxuries slip away easily when need arises, or if he has never had luxuries, that he can still count himself fortunate if he knows God. He understands Jeremiah, "Let not the rich man glory in his riches . . but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he hath understanding and knoweth me." We are going to need that spirit in the days to come. We shall need to be able to savor the simple joys available to all men, "the precious things of the ancient mountains," the voice of the turtle-dove, the children playing in the streets-and also to so live as to say, "Thy word is the joy and the rejoicing of my heart, for I am called by thy name," unless we are to re- sign ourselves to mere dogged endurance of drab-colored life. We in America, so much more fortunate than men in any other country, may well cultivate the thankful spirit of the psalmists, recognizing that gratitude breeds a sense of responsibility and that in turn a spirit of penitence. We need growth along both these lines today. VI A deep sense of community loyalty was bred in the Hebrews from their earliest nomad days of intense clan fealty to the late experiences of persecution for devo- tion to the law, when in the fires of suffer- ing that tenacity and cohesiveness were forged which ever afterwards characterizes the loyal Jewish group. Of course there were dangers in this loyalty, dangers that it should prove, as it often did, a narrow- ing experience, that it should degenerate into an exclusive nationalism and breed a feeling of pride and superiority or even of hostility to those outside the group. One sees the Hebrews gloriously overcoming these temptations in Second Isaiah and Jonah, but slipping down from the heights in much of the later literature. There was no steady upward growth. Shall we say then that the Old Testament is pertinent today in that it shows both the strength and the weaknesses inherent in community loyalty? Shows them to our age which is confronted with the problem of a world rent into hostile groups, a world that is beginning to realize that it must over- come its racial and national pride and prejudices and weld its lesser loyalties into a single all-inclusive one if it is to be saved from chaos and self-destruction? In the din of bursting bombs cannot the separate "sovereign" nations hear the Lord saying, "I planned a world and a world I will have, at whatever cost, a world of men who know they belong together because they all belong to me"?</page><page sequence="6">86 MURIEL STREIBERT CURTIS [May We face today groups of men who are bound together by fanatical loyalties, who have a most ardent sense of community solidarity and who have committed them- selves whole-heartedly and irrevocably to the leader of their group, willingly forfeit- ing even independence and freedom if so the group aims may be attained. Yet those aims which can only be achieved through exploitation of other groups cannot be tol- erated. How can those solidarities be dealt with? Not by men who know no self-effac- ing, deep-seated loyalties, who have made no commitment of themselves to any cause or leader. But their loyalty must be a larger than national one and the leader more trustworthy than a deluded man. We must learn the meaning of Kierkegaard's saying, "Relate thyself relatively to the relative and absolutely to the Absolute." Here the Old Testament, used discriminatingly, can help us, for at times the Hebrews did recognize that since their group was bound together not merely by human, but by divine-human bonds and that since God was universal, the group goodwill must be extended to all, "unto the end of the earth." When William Paton says, "The key to community lies in the recognition of something that transcends human community" he gives modern expression to a realization at which the Old Testament arrives. One more point in connection with the strong feeling of group loyalty in the Old Testament is the natural resulting sense of responsibility for all within the group. It is interesting that the first question in the Old Testament is "Where art thou?," em- phasizing the responsibility of man to God and the second is "Where is thy brother ?" That man is his brother's keeper in the sight of God is brought out in narrative, law and prophecy. What we have come to call so- cial ethics is the ethics chiefly stressed in the Old Testament. Both for correcting a too individualistic type of modern religion and for suggesting to un-religious social idealists the backing and support which re- ligion, truly conceived, gives to efforts for social reform, the study of the Old Testa- ment is useful. VII Unity through diversity and a great va- riety of forms of appeal to a single basic loyalty are found in the Old Testament. A college student writes, "I am amazed at the tremendous variety of religious situa- tions, feelings and ideas. By means of this great scope the Old Testament can appeal to many people and to the same person in many different moods and stages. Ulti- mately in religion each one must select what meets his needs, but the advantage here is that there is so much to choose from." Still, whatever one "chooses" carries one to the same Lord, if the asser- tions made above about an Old Testament religion are true. Some students of the Old Testament have over-emphasized the differences be- tween the prophets and the priests at the ex- pense of an appreciation of their fundamental agreements. The prophets have blame for only unworthy priests and only for a cere- monial system that has lost its touch with spiritual and ethical realities, not for ritual as such. The priestly writings contain no diatribes against the prophets, though a short-sighted individual like Amaziah may dismiss an Amos. That a compromise and a working agreement was possible between these two groups of leaders seems to be indicated in Deuteronomy and perhaps in Ezekiel and elsewhere. The wise men, scribes and psalmists, the prophets and apocalyptists, the historical writers and compilers of codes have their own modes of approach to religion and of appeal to the Hebrew people, their own en- thusiasms and chosen forms of expres- sion, but one seldom gains an impression that they are conflicting with one another or disapproving of one another. This is not to assert that there are no decided and unfortunate differences of opinion, as be- tween the Jews and Samaritans or between</page><page sequence="7">1943] THE RELEVANCE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 87 the Pharisees and Sadducees. The tragic results of such rifts are seen in the forma- tion of a rival sect and a long-continued feud in the first case and in devastating civil wars in the second. So the Old Testa- ment shows both the possibility of diverse points of view being held without friction in a group united at heart and shows that failure to achieve such unity is catastrophic. The conclusion is obvious that again the Old Testament is relevant to an age that is appreciating ecumenicity as never before and is turning toward religious unity with zeal and determination, yet is encountering problems of diversity in ideas and customs between the denominations and between groups within each denomination that seeni at times well-nigh insurmountable. In conclusion we may let college students of many differing back-grounds say briefly in their own way how a study of the Old Testament has proved relevant to them per- sonally. "One who studies the Old Testament be- comes spiritually mature." "The Old Testament is intellectually challenging to a student of today and emo- tionally satisfying." "It makes me aware of God, builds up in me a power of faith and trust." "It has given me a new broad-minded conception and appreciation of the Jewish race." "It has correlated many of my separate ideas of life into a religious whole, with God as the ultimate inspiration for better thoughts and deeds, where formerly I had no guide but other people." "I have found great re-assurance here, for the Bible people kept their faith through so much struggle and trouble. Its perpetua- tion is a triumph. We can hope to maintain ours through similar upheavals." "I have gained a liking to think about such subjects as God, the problem of sui- fering and revelation." "I have gained peace and comfort from an intelligent faith based on the Bible, a faith which is aware of problems and yet is steadfast." "I have come to a realization of a great religious heritage and of our own lacks and weaknesses today in spiritual power, insight and courage." If the Old Testament has this kind of meaning to the younger generation we may feel assured that it can still "speak to the heart" of the world.</page></plain_text>
