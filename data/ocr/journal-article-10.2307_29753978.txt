<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON THE J?MON FIGURIIS ES OF JAPAN In neolithic Japan anthropomorphic figu? rines are frequently found. They, however, start having a real importance, in the field of ceramic production, only from the middle phasis of Jomon period. In Middle Jomon ? whose development was characterised by the Katsusaka fades ? new cultural manifestations are realised. J. E. Kidder writes: ? ...the character of Katsusaka culture ? impressively large vessels with am? bitious decor, the figurine as an entity in itself, the seki-bo, new shape of pit-dwelling, and use of the cylindrically-shaped axe ? all point to fresh and new ideas in Honshu traceable to local inhabitants now asserting their traits in a sudden and dramatic manner, or, more likely, to incomming people who had formerly accustomed to dwelling in mountainous and forested regions.)) (1). The figurines were probably related to this new cultural horizon. Their peculiarity could be connected perhaps with the circumstances, which have favoured the artistic development of plastic conceptions. But we cannot refer the first appearance of the figurines to the beginnings of the Middle Jomon. Older specimens having been found (2), the origin of the whole kind must be traced back to an earlier phase. With the exception of some stone specimens, most of the figurines are moulded in clay. They differ widely in form and style, and that justifies the several typological classifica? tions in which they have been grouped (3). However, in spite of these differences, the figurines, due to their conventional character, show some constant features throughout. Among the anthropomorphic figurines, the female representation predominates; but where identification is uncertain, or where one is inclined to see male raffiguration, a symbolism of a sexual kind is frequently undeniable, even if in some more conventional and elaborate specimens it is not always recognizable. The interpretation of these figurines and their purpose and significance are anything but certain. They have been defined by some scholars as images of divinities, ex voto, decorative statuettes, dolls. In short, the most diverse suppositions have been lined up, one beside the other. One thing however has seemed certain from the start, i.e., that they were part of the household furnishings, for they have always been found in residential sites. Likewise, as they have never been found in burial sites, the hypothesis of their connection with a fu? nerary cult has been excluded. On the strength of these considerations, N. G. Munro was led to set aside as untenable the supposition that these eminently female figurines could have been designed cc as a sub? stitute for living burial in that state of society when wives and female slaves were still called upon to attend the departed ?, but he consi? dered it more likely that they represented ? the effigies of the dead, further that they were intended to receive the soul or persona? lity of the deceased and were not only revered as mementoes but were worshipped for their capacity to affect the well-fare of the living. What seems to be absurd grotesquery had a serious intent, either for the purpose of iden? tification, or of conveying a sense of the exalt? ed station of the departed and perhaps the special qualifications of the ancestor-god. The nudity of some images does not invalidate this opinion; it is probable enough that such figures were clothed in the garments of the period so long as they were held in reverence. Even the nude figures are provided with a loin cloth, though this does not invariably conceal the sex... One may feel some surprise that the feminine sex was apparently favoured but this is not inconsistent with the stage of culture, nor is it quite certain that the pro 92</page><page sequence="2">minent mammae invariably indicate fema? les.)) (4). It is evident the half-way position of this suggestion. If, on the one hand, the archae? ological evidence forced N. G. Munro to re? tain these figurines not directly connected with a funerary cult, on the other, he was not in? clined to relinquish entirely their possible mortuary aspect, in case that they should be considered not as images offered to the de? parted, but as symbolic representations of the dead. But, so far as I know, palaeo-ethnological comparisons do not support, at least for the neolithic age, the theory of a like funerary conception, even though there be frequent evi? dence, in later epochs, of that individual or familiar cult of the hero-ancestors which would be the conclusive inference to be drawn from N. G. Munro's supposition. The thesis, indeed, that these figurines are intended to represent a kind of ancestral di? vinity might find support in the fact that some of them have been found near or among small stones or slabs arranged in circles, as if to form a small shrine (5). Should this be so, one would have to infer the existence of a religious cult, already defi? nitely established, which G. J. Groot was in? clined to connect with fertility concepts (6). The epoch we are dealing with is neolithic. Such an ideology would not therefore be strik? ing, as wide evidence is testified of its exis? tence in very many regions of the Eurasian Continent, a geographical area so vast that it exceeds the narrow limits of an atypical cul? ture. But this ideological conception of the eternal fertility of all nature ? seen in the composite aspect of Mother Goddess symbolically repre? sented by a figure of woman ? would seem to be peculiar exclusively to the agricultural world which sees in fertility an essential con? dition of life (7). It is not unlikely that the primitive agricul? turists symbolised in these figurines the fer? tility of the Mother Earth, on the basis of a common concept in the religion of farming peoples that is to say a female principle seen as generative power tied to the productivity of the ground. It is not however advisable to consider these figurines always as representations of a defi? nite divinity, for instance, the Mother God? dess. More manifestately they must be intended a symbol of sexual values as generative forces so as the male representations, which also recur, acquire a clear meaning. On the other hand, many scholars reject the connection of the figurines with the fertility cult, seen as a basic trait of an agricultural ideological complex, and justify their scepti? cism also with the fact that figurines occurr also in non-agricultural regions. This is, indeed, the specific case of Japan of the Jomon age. Here the neolithic inhabitants did not prac? tice agriculture, but were still in the hunting, fishing and gathering economic stage of palaeo mesolitic type (8). Now, in the case that to this economy an adequate ideology should correspond, a rela? tion of these figurines to some cult shold be justified and sustainable if the same cult does directly connect with the ideological contents of this culture, that economically, as it is said, is palaeo-mesolithic. And here it will be helpful to remember that in the palaeolithic world anthropomor? phic images, more especially female, were widespread. They are explained in the con? nection with ideological values in which the generative powers of the woman occupy a pro? minent place. Among the best known repre? sentations are the gynecomorphic statuettes of Brassenpouy (France), Willendorf (Austria), and Savignano on the Panaro (Italy) (9). They present the evident somatic features of steato pygy which would indicate the magic function related to a concept of human and perhaps also of animal fecundity. This animal fecun? dity seems to be expressed by a zoomorphism which one comes across at times in some repre? sentations in which human and animal forms are associated. Now, although the Jomon figurines show a general tendency to schematise and symbolise the female features, thus gradually losing the marked sexuality of the Palaeolithic ccVenus?, they reveal nevertheless in some instances the pertinency of the steatopygic forms (10). Another morphological feature worthy of note is the perduration over a certain length of time of marked zoomorphic forms. (11) It is, moreover, noticeable that the Jomon figurines, like the palaeolithic images, were never found among the funerary furniture. Dealing with palaeolithic figures G. R. Levy has given an interesting argument on their finds c( in Aurignacian levels of habitation ?, raying that cc At Gagarino on the Don a nurn 93</page><page sequence="3">ber of these images were distributed within, and close beside, the circle of stones which marked a hut-formation. Their milieu is de? finitely domestic... Some cult of human ferti? lity is indicated...)) (12). The circumstances of these finds, within the circle of stones, are identical with those in which Jomon figurines, as above said, are found. These concordances existing among Jomon and palaeolithic figurines, though they do not always occurr and do not even clearly and absolutely indicate a definite connection with a cultural palaeolithic aspect, are never? theless noteworthy in as much as they are found also in other neolithic cultures (13), for which the theory that they cc manifestata mente derivano da una tradizione pertinente al paleolitico superiore )) (14), seems to be ac? cepted. This theory is based more especially on the fact that the neolithic civilisation, essentially an agricultural one, is derived from a previous economic stage of gathering which leads one to suppose an evolutionary process affecting not only the economic but also the cultural, ideological and artistic levels. During this process of evolution in which an agrarian ideology matures, the female fi? gure is invested with new values ? connected with the cult of the mother goddess of the earth ? which are added to the ancient attri? butes of human and animal fecundity. But where an agrarian ideology does not de? velop, and the community goes on living within the framework of an ancient economic structure, it is consequential to suppose that the ideological nexus associated with these fi? gurines preserves the traditional values of the fecundity principle. One might in this way argue that the Jomon figurines of Japan are the continuation of a palaeolithic tradition (15). But at this point a question arises: it is true that the Jomon people of Japan lived in an economic stage of palaeo-mesolithic type, but it is also a fact that their culture appears as specifically neolithic in its whole material equipment, and above all in a very remark? able output of pottery, that usually is part of the cultural horizon of the agricultural world. What explanation can be given of this fact? Undoubtedly we must trace back to the many settlements in the archipelago in the neolithic age made by people coming from dif? ferent parts of the Asian Continent. Were those peoples in possession of an agricultural civilisation &lt;? (in which case it would be difficult to understand why on com? ing to Japan they abandoned their more ad? vanced economy to adopt another and more primitive one, unless we suppose particular ambiental conditions and obstacles of which we know nothing) ? or else were they no? madic or seminomadic peoples in possession only of a neolithic material equipment, the result perhaps of contacts with agricultural populations? In bothe cases would it be justifiable to sup? pose that to they an agricultural ideology was pertinent to them? This is the basic point for the solution of this question. Should they have been in possession of an agricultural ideology, the thesis of a cul? tural palaeolithic tradition, connected with these figurines, would be excluded, unless we suppose that, after the economic change, a revision and redimensionment of the ideolo? gical inheritance was produced. And this, on the other hand, cannot be very easily sup? posed. Adolfo Tamburcllo NOTES (1) J. E. Kidder, Jr., The Jomon Pottery of Japan, Ascona, 1957, p. 29. (2) J. E. Kidder, op. cit., p. 25.
