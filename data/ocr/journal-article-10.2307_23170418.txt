<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL ANALYSIS No. 14, December 1983 THINKING THROUGH THE BODY: An Essay on Understanding Metaphor Michael Jackson "You never Enjoy the World aright, tell the Sea it self floweth in your veins, till you are Clothed with the Heavens, and Crowned with the stars; and perceive yourself to be the Sole Heir of the whole World; and more then so, because Men are in it who are every one Sole Heirs, as well as you." Thomas Traherne (Centuries of Meditation I, 29) "But when you separate mind from the structure in which it is immanent, such as human relationship, the human society, or the ecosystem, you thereby embark, I believe, on fundamental error, which in the end will surely hurt you." Gregory Bateson (Pathologies of Epistemology 1973: 461) The subject of my paper is a mode of speaking, thinking and acting in which personal, social and natural aspects of Being are made to correspond or coalesce. This analogical mode of understanding is pervasive in all human societies, and it is my intention to use examples from both ethnography and poetry to explore one particular set of metaphorical correspondences which link personal, social and natural bodies. Let me first establish the domain of inquiry by adducing some specific examples of this kind of metaphorical correlation of person and world. In the Hippocratic book on the number seven, there is a seven-part map which represents the earth as a human body: its head is the Peloponnesus, the Isthmus is its spinal cord, and Ionia is its diaphragm, "the navel of the world". The moral and intellectual qualities of the peoples inhabiting these regions were thought to be in some way dependent upon these localizations (Cassirer 1955:92). This image of the universe also finds expression in the Greek stoic philosophers who argued that the world was an animate and rational being. Such a view led to detailed correspondences being traced out between Man and Nature, and in the first century A.D. the Roman philosopher and statesman, Seneca, declared that Nature was like the body of Man, watercourses corresponding to veins, geological substances to flesh, earthquakes to convulsions, and so on.1 This view, which persists throughout late antiquity and informs the hermetic tradition of Medieval and Renaissance Europe, has a corollary in the notion that correspondences exist between the human body and the state. This organic model of the body politic finds its way through Menenius and Plutarch into Shakespeare's plays,2 and continues to flourish as a root metaphor in positivist sociology (Brockbank 1976:38). Traditional Chinese philosophy is similarly concerned with these symbolic correlations between the personal body and the body of the world. The conception of a world-organism, a resonant whole in which everything was mutually dependent, pervaded all branches of Chinese art and learning, as well as being the basis of divinatory systems like the/ C/n&gt;?g(Needham 1978:164). As Philip Rawson notes, "the Chinese regard the inner and outer worlds of experience as having identical systems of physiology" and the aim of Chinese medicine and mysticism is to keep the two systems working in congruence, attuned one to the other (Rawson 127</page><page sequence="2">1968:231). The close analogy drawn between the body of man and the body of the earth is perfectly illustrated in Chinese water-colour landscapes. Replete with sexual imagery, the paintings depict mountains as metaphors of heaven, Yang, the bright, while the valleys with their effluent mists are images of Yin. From one to the other flow the fertilizing waters of heaven, in streams and water-falls (Rawson 1968:256). Comparable notions abound in Hindu scriptures. In the Chandogya Upanishad (V, xviii) the universal self is: the brilliant (sky), its eye is (the sun) which possesses every form, its breath is (the wind) whose nature is to follow various paths, its body is broad (space), its bladder is the wealth (of water), its feet are the earth, its breast is the sacrificial alter, its hair is the sacrificial straw, its heart is the householder's fire, its mind is the southern sacrificial fire and its mouth is the eastern sacrificial fire (Zaehner 1966). In Vedic hymns all living things, including the sun, the moon and the air, are created from parts of the body of purusa, a man offered up in sacrifice by the Gods. And social groupings have the same bodily origin: "The Brahmin was his mouth, his arts were made the Rajanya (warrior), his two thighs the Vaisya (trader and agriculturalist), from his feet the Sudra (servile class) was born" (Thomas 1923:122). In Tantric philosophy too, the macrocosm is thought to be contained within the microcosm of the human body, and the tantric map of the universe employs sexual imagery to mediate the union of Siva and Sakti (male and female principles), Self and World. Controlled movement of energy in the field of the body (through ritual intercourse, worship, pilgrimage, and prayer) becomes a means of resonating with, and re-cognizing, the ultimate ground of all Being (Bharati 1965). The kinds of correlations found in Tantric thought, between parts of the body, parts of speech, and parts of the world, also figure prominently in the world-view of the Dogon of Mali. According to Genevieve Calame-Griaule, the Dogon conceive the world in its totality as a gigantic human organism, and parts of the Dogon world reproduce this image on a greater or lesser scale (Calame-Griaule 1965:27). Thus the village is conceptualised as a person, lying north-south, the smithy at his head, shrines at his feet, and the Dogon house is an anthropomorphic representation of a man lying on his side and procreating (Griaule 1954:95-98). Moreover, a regular geology of the human body is recognised by the Dogon for whom different kinds of minerals correspond to different bodily organs, various earths being organs 'within the belly', rocks being assimilated to the 'bones' of the skeleton, and a family of red clays made to represent the blood. Different rocks and stones stand for different parts of the body, so that one rock balanced on another is the 'chest' and small white river pebbles are 'toes'. The Dogon also maintain that each of these phenomenal correspondences 'speaks' to man, auguring or signifying something which must be deciphered if man is to flourish. Thus, words are likened to grain, speech to germination, and divination to winnowing. And body parts have analogues in parts of the grain (heart=cotyledon; nose=germ etc.) as well as in intonations of the voice (Calame-Griaule 1965:27-57). That identical metaphors are recognised in English poetry can be established by citing Coleridge's question: "Are not words parts and germinations of the plant?" But at this point it is necessary to define a clearer path through these fields of associative imagery, examples of which could be multiplied indefinitely. Let us therefore consider in detail two particular instances of thinking through the body, one from poetry and one from ethnography, both of which focus on similar correspondences between particular bodily actions and specific elements of landscape. 128</page><page sequence="3">These are the opening verses of Dylan Thomas s poem, In the White Giant's Thigh (1950). Through throats where many rivers meet, the curlews cry, Under the conceiving moon, on the high chalk hill, And there this night I walk in the white giant's thigh Where barren as boulders women lie longing still To labour and love though they lay down long ago. Through throats where many rivers meet, the women pray, Pleading in the waded bay for the seed to flow Though the names on their weed grown stones are rained away, And alone in the night's eternal, curving act They yearn with tongues of curlews for the unconceived And immemorial sons of the cudgelling, hacked Hill. In these lines the human body is assimilated to the landscape, and the sexual and geomorphological images of the poem have exact parallels in the worldviews already referred to. The confluence of several rivers is likened to the throat of the cervix, a bay to the womb, a chalk hillside to the thigh, while fecundity and poetic fluency alike are linked to phases of the moon, tides in the bay, and seasonal rhythms of the weather and of animal life. Physiological, metereorological, geographical and poetical processes are all condensed into unifying images whose ambiguity is expressed semantically by such key phrases as "conceiving moon" and "curving act".3 As Dylan Thomas puts it later in the poem: All birds and beasts of the linked night uproar and chime... Let us now turn from this "most bodily universe" (Miles 1948:448) of Dylan Thomas's poem and consider an ethnographical analogue of it. Two hundred miles north of San Francisco, the Redwood Highway enters a region of evergreen forest, sea fog, and mountain rain, and just before the Oregon border crosses the estuary of the Klamath river: the traditional centre of the Yurok Indian world. The Yurok conceived of their world as a great disc, divided by the Klamath river, and surrounded the sea. Yet they took no interest in whence the river came or in the ocean beyond the river's mouth. Their cultural and economic life was concentrated on the river itself, and on the annual salmon run which supplied enough food for the entire year. The river was both the source of their livelihood and the focus of their cultural existence, and in the Yurok worldview, ideas pertaining to the river and its environs, to the salmon and its biology, and to human physiology and anatomy were coalesced. Thus, the periodical affluence of the waterway had "a functional interrelation with the periodicity of vital juices in the body's nutritional, circulatory, and procreative systems" and the main concern of Yurok magical activity was to ensure "that vital channels be kept open and that antagonistic fluids be kept apart" (Erikson 1943:258). This Yiirok theory of correspondence is vividly illustrated by an anecdote of Erik Erikson who worked among the Yurok during the 1930s. When he first arrived on the Klamath, Erikson met an elderly female healer who treated somatic disorders and did psychotherapy with children. Erikson discovered that the principles of Yurok therapy were not unlike the principles of psychoanalysis, and he began to "exchange notes" with the old woman. But he noticed that, despite her willingness to talk, she seemed melancholy and withdrawn. It soon became 129</page><page sequence="4">apparent that her gloominess stemmed from an incident some days before when she had stepped out into her vegetable garden and, glancing down the hundred foot slope to where the Klamath enters the Pacific, had seen a small whale enter the rivermouth, play about a little and then disappear. Since the creator (Wohpekumeu, "the widower across the ocean") had decreed that only salmon, sturgeon and such fish should cross the fresh-water barrier, the episode portended that the world-disc was slowly tilting from the horizontal, that salt water was entering the river, and that a flood was approaching which might destroy all mankind. However, the old woman's anxieties went deeper than this and reflected the very nature of her profession as a healer. A healer must have superb control over the oral-nutritional canal because he or she has to suck the 'pains' from a patient's body and then, having swallowed two or three of these 'pains', vomit them up. The 'pains' are visualised as slimy, bloody stuff resembling tadpoles, and the healer is able to vomit them up without bringing up food as well. In preparing for such a healing session, a healer must abstain from drinking water because water and the bloody substances extracted from the patient's body are mutually-antagonistic. The same reasoning explains why, after eating venison — a 'bloody' meat — one should wipe one's hands clean and not wash them in water. The underlying principle is that contrasted fluids like blood and water, semen and water, or urine and water, should never meet in the same aperture or channel. Thus, salmon — which are water-born — must be kept away from the house of a menstruating woman, money — which originates in another 'stream' — must not be brought into association with sexual intercourse, a person must never urinate in the river, and oral sex is banned because cunnilingus prevents money flowing and interferes with the salmon run in the Klamath. All such inappropriate conjunctions are thought to lead to impoverishment and weakening of both people and the natural environment. We can now understand how the salt-water whale entering the fresh-water stream signals a more general disturbance of the geographical-anatomical environment. Something alien and inedible enters the rivermouth which only edible things like salmon and sturgeon should enter. This suggests an inversion of the oral scheme of things in which control of the mouth is fundamental to social and ethical integration. It is because the Yurok healer is preeminently a master of oral nutritional processes — sucking, vomiting, avoiding the use of'dirty' words — that such an inversion affects the heaW more deeply than others, and requires his or her skills to redress the ecological imbalance. This may explain why, when the old woman saw the whale in the mouth of the river, her first reaction was to keep quiet about it, possibly hoping that by so controlling her own mouth she might induce some change in the external world. In both Yurok cosmogony and the poem by Dylan Thomas the world of things is merged with the world of Being, and as a consequence 'things' like stones, hillsides, and whales assume the status of 'signs' whose decipherment mediates understanding and action in the human world. This corporeal and sensible way of 'reading' what the world means presupposes a continuity between language, knowledge and bodily praxis, a view which is characteristic of preliterate societies where knowledge and speech cannot be readily abstracted from contexts of practical activity.4 It is because, in such societies, knowledge is articulated in skills, formulae and routines upon which physical livelihood directly depends that it is 'logical' for preliterate peoples to emphasise the embodied character of knowledge and speech, such as when the Dogon equate word and seed or speak of the ripe millet being 'pregnant'.5 Metaphor here is situated. It discloses the functional interrelations between proper knowledge, productive activity, correct speech, and 130</page><page sequence="5">socio-physical wellbeing. Metaphor is not merely a figure of speech, drawing an analogy or playing on a resemblance for the sake of verbal effect. Dylan Thomas also took the view that body, world and idea must be equated, and he saw the poet's task as one of registering and rendering these equations as succinctly and truthfully as possible.6 From this view arises the notion that the world of physical things is continuous with the animate and articulate world of Mind. Thus, Dylan Thoams speaks of the rain wringing "out its tongues on the faded yard" much as the old Yurok healer speaks of the social repercussions of the whale which enters the mouth of the Klamath river. The Dogon too scrutinise the natural world for auguries that bear upon the human condition so that, for example, should a tree be found which fruits without first flowering, this may be siad to be a sign that a woman could well conceive a child without having resumed menstruating after the birth of a previous child.The metaphor is founded on the correspondence which the Dogon say exists between flowering and fruiting in the vegetable world and menstruating and giving birth in the human world (Calame Griaule 1965:28). In order to fathom the significance of these anthropomorphic images we must first emphasise that they are socially-constructed and not idiosyncratic. Although one becomes a healer among the Yurok through a mixture of parental persuasion and childhood dreams that suggest a latent ability for shamanistic healing, the system of therapeutic ideas and practices is constituted culturally and not personally. Even when a Yurok healer interprets an illness by applying personal knowledge of the patient's personality and family background, the diagnosis always conforms to social stereotypes such as that adulterous liaisons and malevolent thoughts about other people cause one to become ill. The same interplay between a unique biography and a conventional repertoire of ideas is shown in Dylan Thomas's poetry. Thus, although In the white giant's thigh is highly-individual in style and reflects a private preoccupation with links between physical and verbal potency, its elegaic form and sprung rhythms recall traditional techniques, while its fund of images is culled from a common cultural heritage: the fertility-engendering giant cut on a chalk hill, the fertility-giving river flood, the double-understanding of conception, and towards the close of the poem the biblical allusions and the reference to Guy Fawkes' fires. Creativity, then, is a license exercised within a socially-constituted frame of reference, which is why the Yurok healer's individual gifts are a boon for the whole community and why Dylan Thomas's poems can speak to and for us all. Metaphor and Embodiment I now want to consider the social and psychophysical aspects of metaphor in everyday language. Here, one finds abundant evidence that the world of the body and the body of the world have something in common. We readily speak of an angry sky, of stars looking down, of the wind blowing, of a brooding landscape, of social ills, and of economic depression and recovery as if these natural or social phenomena were themselves possessed of consciousness and will. Reciprocally, we speak of the shoulder or brow of a hill and the foot of a mountain, of being petrified with fright, of having roots, of being turned on, switched off and burnt out, of a person reacting automatically or behaving mechanically as if the body of the earth and the actions of a machine were somehow connected to the world of the human body. In analysing these metaphors it is not enough to say that they arise because subjectivity can identify itself only through external objects,7 or that they arise because "the human body and its functions are the primary frame of reference in 131</page><page sequence="6">naming objects of the perceived world" (Thass-Thienemann 1968:253), or that anthropomorphic metaphors simply reflect the fact that, ontogenetically, the first 'language' of life is gestural, postural and bodily (Diamond 1959; Thass Thienemann 1968: 38-39). For, to emphasise the psychophysical or social aspects of metaphor construction and use is unhelpful as long as it implies a dualistic conception of human behaviour and a linear form of reasoning which, in the case of metaphor, makes one aspect of the trope prior or primary. Such a lopsided view is immediately suggested whenever metaphor is defined as a way of saying something "in terms of' or "by way of' something else.8 My argument is that metaphor must be apprehended non-dualistically and that the idea or sensation and its bodily complements (social, mechanical, physiological, geographical etc.) betoken, not an arbitrary or rhetorical synthesis of two terms — subject and object,9 tenor and vehicle — which can be defined more realistically apart from each other, but a true interdependency of mind and body, Self and World. In my view, metaphor reveals unities; it is not a figurative way of denying dualities. Metaphor reveals, not the "thisness of a that" but rather that "this is that". Thus, in the famous Upanishadic parable of the fig tree, the indivisibility of the world is revealed through a seed which, when taken from the fig and then further divided, appears to be nothing at all, yet from this very essence the tree grows. The teacher tells the adept: This finest essence, — the whole universe has it as its Self: That is the Real: That is the Self: That you are Svetaketu! (Zaehner 1966) R.H. Blyth expresses a poet's understanding of metaphor when he writes of it as "a consummation of identity", noting that in poetry "we often say more than we mean" and "speak more truly than we know" because we disclose the identity of that which the intellect separates (Blyth 1942:154, 166). Haiku are the purest expression of metaphor because haiku are this "thou art it" (tat tvam asi). "When a man becomes a bamboo groove swaying in the windy rain, a cicada crying itself and its life away, then he is 'it'" (Blyth 1947(v-i): 4-5). If this identity of Self and World which metaphor discloses is real, then our awareness of it is decidedly impermanent and occasional, and it is necessary to consider in some detail the variability of metaphorical value. Quiescent and Active Metaphor The etymology of even the most abstract words often refers us to the body. Our word "time" is from the Latin tempus, originally denoting a "stretch" and cognate with témpora — "temples of the head" — perhaps because the skin stretches and corrugates here as one grows older.10 In Chinese too, the word for duration (chiu) was explained by the Han lexicographers as derived from the character jen, man, a man stretching his legs and walking 'a stretch', just as a roof stretches across a space, and time stretches from one event to another (Needham 1965:1 ). A second example, which I shall elaborate upon later in this essay, is the verb "to know" which, in all Indo-European languages, is cognate with "king", "kin", "kind", "generation", "knee", and "can". Indeed the embodied intentionality of human Being seems to be inextricably tied up with our views about the world, and "I think" (cogito) is inseparable from "I can" (practico). As Merleau-Ponty puts it: Our body, to the extent that it moves itself about, that is, to the extent that it is inseparable from a view of the world and is that view itself brought into existence, is the condition of possibility, not only of the geometrical synthesis, but of all expressive operations and all acquired views which constitute the cultural world (Merleau-Ponty 1962:388). Thus, the physical ability to move out into the world is at the same time an expression of growing-up socially and of being capable of supporting others, which 132</page><page sequence="7">may be why the knees and parts of the leg are, in many societies, metaphors for kinship categories." And it is because human consciousness is intentional and embodied that such metaphors readily rediscover themselves in our thought, as when Dylan Thomas writes of walking in the white giant's thigh where barren women pray to be able to conceive, and thus hits upon an old Indo-European connection between the thigh, conception, and kinship.12 But in such examples, references to the body are implicit and usually below the threshold of our awareness. In everyday life, when we say a nuisance is a "pain in the neck", a "headache" or a "handful", or that someone is "stiff-necked" or "looks down on us" we are seldom mindful of the actual links between the mental or emotional attitude signified and the bodily praxis which does the signifying. If a nuisance actually does give us a headache or sore neck we are still unlikely to regard the relationship between the verbal form and the actual event as anything other than arbitrary. This is, I believe, the case in both literate and nonliterate societies. For instance, when in English we speak of the mouth of a river it is usually without any thought or visualisation of a human mouth. Among the Kuranko of Sierra Leone, where I have carried out fieldwork, the same suspension of disbelieve applies in everyday speech. One enters a house through its "mouth" (i.e. 'door') or "cuts one's mouth off' from one's natal home (when building a house of one's own) or "cuts one's mouth off from another person" (when one takes umbrage) without necessarily being aware of the psychophysical side of the metaphors, e.g. that leaving home is like 'cutting one's mouth off the breast' at weaning because, thereafter, one can no longer depend on the family granary for one's food.13 In fact, we would consider it very odd if anyone consciously required or sought a real connection between word and thing as a precondition of meaningful speech, though this is often one of the defining characteristics of schizophrenic thought, and is found occasionally in non-pathological cases as well. A.R. Luria, the Russian neuropsychologist, describes such a case, a mnemonist for whom words immediately conjured up a wealth of synesthetic associations which blurred the boundary between objects and sensations, imagination and reality, perception and feeling. The colours, tastes, textures and images that surrounded every word the mnemonist read or heard would become obstacles to logical and abstract reasoning, for he could dismiss nothing from his mind and could not avoid the sensations and reveries which continually fused words and things. Genuinely abstract ideas, like infinity, eternity and nothingness, frightened him, because they summoned up no concrete images. As he put it, "I can only understand what I can visualize" (Luria 1969:130). Socially, the mnemonist appeared to be slow-witted and dull simply because he could not easily disconnect the words which mediate social relationships from the inward sensations and associations with which the words were imbued. Quotidian lile goes on without any special significance being attached to the anthropomorphic figures which abound in common speech. However, on certain occasions, these mundane metaphors are activated and realised in quite extraordinary ways. Thus, when Dylan Thomas wrote his poems, his experience was not unlike that of the mnemonist: "When I experience anything, I experience it as a thing and a word at the same time, both equally amazing" (cited by Reid 1954:20). Again, among the Ojibwa there is an implicit category distinction in the language between animate and inanimate. Stones are grammatically animate and Ojibwa sometimes speak to stones as if they were persons, but this does not mean that the Ojibwa are animists "in the sense that they dogmatically attribute living souls to animate objects such as stones"; rather, they recognize "potentialities for animation in certain classes of objects under certain circumstances. The Ojibwa do 33</page><page sequence="8">not perceive stones, in general, as animate, any more than we do" (Hallowell 1958:65). If we now reconsider the Yurok metaphors described earlier we can be more specific about the circumstances in which the activation of anthropomorphic metaphor occurs. According to Erik Erikson, the geographical-anatomical imagery of the Yurok only really comes into force in situations of crisis: "wherever mysterious food sources beyond the Yurok's territory, technology, and causal comprehension need to be influenced, or whenever vague human impulses and fears need to be alleviated" (Erikson 1943:258). In crisis, the Yurok apply the oral model of childhood conditioning in an attempt to grasp and master "geographic space by projecting nearest environment, namely body feelings, onto it" (Erikson 1943:276). In other words, metaphors which are ordinarily quiescent (yet are the verbal correlatives of actual bodily dispositions) are activated on such critical occasions to mediate changes in people's bodies and experience, as well as alter their relationships with one another and the world.14 An elementary example of this activation of metaphor is agonistic imagery in everyday English (arguments get attacked, demolished, shot down, lost or won etc.; see Lakoff and Johnson 1980:4), which may become realised in actual physical fighting when people lose their tempers in an argument. Crisis is also the key to understanding the way poetry activates metaphors which are ordinarily quiescent. Although, in the case of poetry, the crisis is often self-induced rather than adventitious, the transformation which realises connections between personal, social and natural bodies requires as its precondition a disruption of normal psychophysical and social patterns.15 But, however it is induced, the movement which carries a poet into this new awareness, imbuing words with more than ordinary power, is of the very nature of metaphor (literally, "to exchange and move"). It is in this sense that Ezra Pound speaks of great literature as "simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree" (Pound 1954:23) and Wallace Stevens writes: The poem refreshes life so that we share, For a moment, the first idea... The poem, through candour, brings back a power again That gives a candid kind to everything. Now, some would argue that these applications of anthropomorphic metaphor are merely rhetorical or magical; beautiful, but based on illusory attributions of will and consciousness to the external, non-human world. At most, it might be said, these metaphors are instances of some mythopoeic propensity of the primitive or unconscious mind, inferior in all but aesthetic properties to the logical and abstract reasoning of a civilized person.16 It may be admitted that anthropomorphic thinking is often prompted by crisis, when the logical or social structure of the world breaks down, but such recourse to metaphor is usually dismissed as neurotic, regressive, or downright erroneous.17 I want to argue a different view: that metaphor is a part of all thought, that it is a correlate of patterns of bodily action and interaction, that the use of metaphor in poetry and ritual is efficacious in a very real sense, and that the elaborate analogies drawn between personal, social, and natural bodies cannot be written off as mere figures of speech or regarded as more definitive of preliterate than of literate thought. Metaphor, Body Use and Habitus Let us first consider the contention that metaphor is a verbal correlate of patterns of body use and interaction. Here I will turn from metaphors of waterways and discuss pathways and movement along paths. My examples are drawn from 134</page><page sequence="9">African ethnography, but metaphors of pathways are well-nigh universal,18 and later in the essay I will refer to examples from English poetry. The Kuranko of Sierra Leone use the word kile ("path" or "road") as a metaphor for social relationship. For instance, the adage nyendan bin to kile a wa ta an segi describes the way a particular species of grass (used for thatching) bends one way as you go along a path through it, and then bends back the other way as you return along the path. This movement to and fro of grass along a pathway is used a metaphor for the movement of people and of goods and services within a community; it is a metaphor for reciprocity. Thus, in Kuranko one often explains the reason for giving a gift, especially to an in-law, with the phrase kile ka na faga, "so that the path does not die". However, if relations between affines or neighbours are strained, it is often said that "the path is not good between them" (kile nyuma san tema), and if a person disappoints a friend then people may comment a ma kile nyuma tama a bo ma ("he did not walk on the good path with his friend").19 As soon as one enters a Kuranko village one realises how natural this metaphor is, because a village comprises a number of open spaces called luiye around which are clustered circular thatched houses, and these open spaces are interconnected by a labyrinth of narrow lanes and dusty paths. But the metaphor is not just descriptive. The physical movement of people within the community is largely determined by social, economic and moral imperatives such as visiting and greeting, sharing food, cooperating in food production and in festivals, and giving gifts or services according to commitments of in-lawship, neighbourliness, or kinship. Community, say the Kuranko, is a matter of "pulling well together" or of "moving together". In these ways a habitus is produced: a configuration of structures such as houses, courtyards, gardens, lanes, and cooking yards, which impose a habitual pattern on the movement of people.20 Thus, the Kuranko house is divided into male and female domains21 which impose a pattern of sexual segregation on those who live in it. This sexual segregation can always be seen to ramify beyond the house, as a result of a chain of linked ideas which refer simultaneously to the body, to the house, to the conception of children, and to political and economic practices. Men are associated with the front and forecourt of the house, provide the seed from which a child grows, sow rice and harvest grain, and control jural and political life; women are associated with the back of the house, provide the container (womb) in which a foetus grows, tend rice and cook grain, and are politically and jurally marginal.22 Everyday tasks and objects reinforce these distinctions, so that the way women lift and let fall a pestle when pounding grain in a mortar, the sway of the body needed in winnowing rice, and the suppleness required in tending a hearth or bending to an infant all become habitual dispositions, defining for the Kuranko a mode of comportment which is typically 'feminine.' On the other hand, the arduous work of the men in felling trees or hoeing steep hillsides fosters muscular strength and rigidity which, in turn, become metaphors for the 'masculine' disposition and justifications for male politico-jural control. By contrast, the supple and fluent movements of women as they bend to their daily tasks, give rise to metaphors which make women out to be capricious and unreliable. In all these instances, therefore, patterns of body use are correlated with metaphors which in effect mediate between the world of material objects and the world of ideas or sentiments. But there is always a very real connection between the physical disposition of objects in the material environment and the social or temperamental disposition of people. The metaphor of paths both recognises these connections between material, social, bodily, conceptual and temperamental horizons and fuses these horizons into a single image. But how exactly does the imagery of pathways relate to the human body? In many African societies the metaphor of pathways applies not only to social 135</page><page sequence="10">relationships, but to individual anatomy and physiology. Among the Songhai of Mali, for instance, movements of 'blood', 'heat' and 'breath' take place along pathways in the body (fondo: "pathway" or "road"). When these movements of blood, heat or breath flow unimpeded in the right direction a person is healthy, but if the flow is reversed or obstructed illness occurs. Vital organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach are likened to crossroads where blood or heat is concentrated and then diffused. Illness signifies that blood, heat or breath have become blocked, withdrawn, or forced to flow backwards (Bisilliat 1976:555-578). This view of health and disease is based upon a kind of reciprocal anthropomorphism whereby extrapolations are made from the social and material habitus in order to describe and explain individual psychophysiology. But the analogies are more than descriptive, because there are in fact vital links between the well-being of individuals and the quality of social relationships. Patterns of economic cooperation and exchange within an African village are the material bases of individual life, as well as symbols of community.23 The Songhai view is characteristic of the African notion that the fate of the individual is linked to the quality of his or her social relationships, and beyond this to economic and political realities. Like the riverine metaphors of the Yurok, African metaphors of pathways coalesce social, economic, political and anatomical elements into a single image which in effect expresses the essential interdependence of those elements. Such metaphors are thus the verbal correlates of patterns of social interaction and bodily disposition within the habitus. And this may explain why metáphors of self refer universally to such immediate elements of the habitus as house, animals, plants, and in modern societies, machines.24 It is largely because metaphors refer simultaneously to the self and the socio economic habitus that they are instrumental in mediating between ideology and economic infrastructure. Metaphor is the bridge we use when teaching children the skills upon which economic production depends and, reflexively, when we try to think our way out of an impasse and find a way of moving back into the world of social activity.25 Let us explore some examples of metaphor as a mode of praxis. As we have already seen, the Songhai regard the circulation of people, goods and services along paths in the village as vitally connected to the circulation of blood, heat and breath in the individual body. The metaphor of pathways mediates this link between socio-economic practices and ideas about health and disease. Among the Kuranko, this link between the social and the psychophysical is emphasised in a slightly different way. When there is a breakdown or rupture (to use our metaphors) in social relationships, the Kuranko often speak of the paths between people being obstructed or darkened. Diviners may say that "the gates are closed". A gift can "open" the path, just as a sacrifice to the ancestors "clears" or "purifies" the path between members of a lineage and their forebears. And if a person confesses a grudge or illwill towards a neighbour, it is thought that the confession makes good the path again. The metaphor of walking along paths is also central in many Kuranko oral narratives. Thus, a key metaphor for impeded social communication is lameness, and a reluctance or difficulty in walking is associated with two kinds of social situation: the first, when an eldest son is loathe to grow up and succeed to his father's position, the second where a girl is loathe to marry and bear children. While the first failure leads to an interrupted succession which threatens the continuity of a lineage, the second implies a breakdown in the system of marriage-exchanges on which are built the alliances among different clans in the village.26 If we recall the etymological link which exists in Indo-European languages between knee, knowledge and generation we gain an insight into the significance of the metaphor of lameness. An artificial prolonging of childhood, involves in any society a sort of 136</page><page sequence="11">self-immobilization in which a person eschews knowledge of adulthood and refuses to generate either social relationships or children. Limping, like halting speech, is thus an expression of psychophysical ambivalence in which a deeply regressive urge inhibits the social imperative of growing up and "standing on one's own feet". In Kuranko narratives, the metaphor of lameness is a way of focussing attention on this social imperative, yet it refers to a mode of behaviour in the real world — walking — which is one of the bases of all social praxis. It is not just linguistic convention that leads us to employ metaphors of walking and of paths but an inherent relation between these metaphors and patterns of practical activity. This is nicely shown by the Kabyle (Algeria) notion of the "measured pace" (neither lagging like a sluggard nor running ahead like a dancer) as an expression of a person's adjustment to the collective rhythms of work "which assign each act its particular moment in the space of the day, the year, or human life" (Bourdieu 1977:162). It is the inseparability of conceptual and bodily activity which explains why metaphors often mediate the forms of human illness. Thus, a not untypical 'conversion reaction' among neurotics who embody the contradictions of their familial environment is paralysis or pain in the legs, and acute difficulty in walking.27 Unconscious compliance in cultural metaphors about illness undoubtedly means that both disease and theory of disease arise out of the same habitus.2* And insofar as cognitive and physical aspects of our Being-in-the-world are inseparable, it is impossible to accept the view that "illness is not a metaphor, and that the most truthful way of regarding illness — and the healthiest way of being ill — is one most purified of, most resistant to, metaphoric thinking".29 If metaphor mediates illness, it can also mediate cure. But before turning to consider the therapeutic value of metaphor we should note that metaphors mediate relationships between conceptual and physical domains of the habitus in a dialectical manner. For instance, Songhai metaphors of anatomical paths and Yurok metaphors of anatomical streams (like our "canals" and "ducts") emerge from a kind of reciprocal anthropomorphism whereby an element in the shared material habitus is internalised by individuals, and becomes thereby a part of a collective ideology of self, a 'common knowledge'. But this internalisation is an active appropriation of the habitus, not a passive or automatic process in which the social body, in some mysterious way, gets mirrored or projected on the static individual body where it serves as a kind of linguistic analogue of social structure.30 Moreover, this active realization of correlations between self and habitus presupposes an externalization which has already occurred, in which the self through bodily movement in concrete situations has discovered for itself an identity in relation to the immediate environment of cultural and natural objects: kinsmen, houses, animals, rivers, hills, and plants (both vegetable and industrial).31 This extrapolation outwards, in which more and more distance is tolerated between the body and the object ('knee' versus 'knowledge') is the basis of abstraction, and when the world of objects is finally re-assimilated through the process of reciprocal anthropomorphism the person finds himself determined, not by subjective attitudes, but by socially-constructed ideas. In this dialectical movement, metaphors are crucial mediates or synthesisers because they refer to the body on the one hand and to social and natural environments on the other. It is in this synthetic function that their power as instruments of social learning lies. They can 'make over' the person to the social world, and reciprocally 'imprint' the social world upon the person's body. Thus, metaphors of cultivation, ripening and harvest are used by the Kuranko when initiating boys into manhood. Psychophysical maturity is thereby likened to the growth of the rice, but the growth of rice depends reciprocally on a 137</page><page sequence="12">mature and cooperative attitude among men. As the Kuranko put it, they must 'move well together'. Metaphorical Instrumentality and Therapy Earlier in this essay I drew a distinction between quiescent and active metaphor, and pointed out that the instrumental possibilities of metaphor are usually realised in a crisis. It is now necessary to expand and illustrate this view that metaphors are means of doing things and not merely ways of sayings things.32 For the sake of argument let us define a crisis as any situation in which there occurs an unbearable conflict between two or more ideas ("being in two minds"), between two or more practical possibilities ("being pulled or tugged in two directions") or between conceptual and practical alternatives ("wanting or knowing what to do but now how to do it"). In all these 'double-bind' situations an impasse is reached which may be manifest mentally or verbally as a 'dilemma' or 'contradiction', or physically and energetically as a 'bind', 'knot', 'spasm', 'tearing' or 'splitting'. In short, the unity of Being-in-the-world is broken. Since metaphors coalesce social, personal and natural aspects of Being, as well as unifying ideas and practices, it is only to be expected that metaphors should often be called upon in resolving these double-binds and in making people whole again. It is because anthropomorphic metaphors unite these various domains in the one image that they enable movement from one domain to another. In particular, a movement is facilitated from the domain where the double-bind is manifest and where, therefore, anxiety is most intense, to another domain which is relatively free from anxiety and accordingly still open to control and manipulation. Metaphor thus mediates a transference from the area of greatest stress to a neutral area which is held to correspond with it.33 In this process, metaphors which are usually quiescent and taken for granted are activated and given literal value. Here are some examples of this metaphorical instrumentality: (a) Aristotle recommended walking or running as a way of dealing with mental depression. The key metaphor here makes fluency of body movement analogous to fluency in thought: activating the body will alleviate the tendency towards immobilization and depresión in the mind. (b) Among the Kuranko, diviners are consulted when a person falls ill. By addressing river pebbles (neutral objects) which he lays out on a mat, the diviner is able to 'see' the cause of the illness. Bodily sickness is often attributed to a social event such as a wife's infidelity, a grievance nursed towards a neighbour, a failure to make sacrifices to one's ancestors. And appropriate social actions — a wife's confession, an apology to one's neighbour, a sacrifice to one's ancestors — has a correspondingly beneficial effect on the body and mind of the ailing individual. (c) A Yurok shaman responds to a geographical crisis, such as a whale entenng the mouth of a salmon river, by asserting control over a corresondingzone of his or her anatomy: the oral-nutritional canal. In the first case the domain of mind is manipulated by bodily activity; in the second case the domain of body-mind is manipulated by social activity; in the third case the domain of geography is manipulated by bodily activity. At first sight the choice of neutral domain seems to be arbitrary, and in most societies there is a certain amount of opportunism and experimentation in discovering a domain where action proves effective in dealing with the domain where the stress is manifest. Among the Kuranko, for example, a failure of a herbal remedy may lead a sick person to consult a diviner who may prescribe a form of social therapy (gift giving or sacrifice or confession); if this therapy fails, the person may well end up 138</page><page sequence="13">consulting a western-trained doctor.34 The same sort of medical pluralism occurs in modern societies when a failure of psychoanalysis (a talking cure) leads a person to try group-therapy (a social cure) or some kind of physiotherapy (bioenergetics, hatha-yoga, or gardening). However, in all these cases it is not just a matter of discovering a neutral domain where action is possible, but of discovering a neutral domain which is most immediately connected to the domain where stress is manifest according to an inherent patterning of causes involving specific elements of each domain of Being.35 For example, in the case of hayfever ('caused' by hypersensitivity of the mucous members to foreign proteins like pollen grains), the 'original' cause is often found to be social anxiety connected with infantile sexual curiosity which was repressed by a sexually-inhibited mother, rather than some natural factor such as genetic proneness or amount of pollen in the atmosphere (Black 1969:101). Nevertheless, these genetic and environmental factors remain causal, though distantly, and in seeking to alleviate the physical symptoms of hayfever a sufferer may well find out that the proximate and therapeutically effective 'cause' lies in his dealing with the guilt that led him into the habit of exploring the world by smell instead of touch, yet in such an ambivalent way as to lead to the self-punitive and self-immobilizing hayfever syndrome. One of the drawbacks of much modern medicine is its reluctance to range over all the domains of Being — personal, social, natural — in diagnostic and therapeutic work. A kind of absolutism prevails in which specific symptoms are assigned determinate causes,36 and doctors pour scorn on the opportunistic character of 'alternative' or 'primitive' medicine. Such doctrinal inflexibility undoubtedly reflects the fact that metaphor is no longer a key instrumentality in modern medical practice.37 Yet, as we have seen, it is by facilitating movement within the total field of Being that metaphor is a crucial means of locating areas where we can act upon those areas where we have lost the power to act. Insofar as modern medicine makes the doctor the sole actor in diagnostic and therapeutic practice, the devalorizaton of metaphor may also be seen as a way of taking away from the patient the means of participating in his or her own diagnosis and treatment. Unlike specialist jargons, metaphors are part of a common fund, a common knowledge. And because this fund is equally accessible to both doctors and patients it tends to democratise medicine and prevent the establishment of social divisions based on different degrees of know-how. It would be a mistake to disparage metaphorical instrumentality as a primitive mode of thought, a magical or primary-process activity. In my view, differences in modes of thought across cultures are idiomatic rather than formal, and if we take care to relate thought to context of use when we make cross-cultural comparisons this becomes quite obvious. If crisis be considerd one such context, we find that metaphorical instrumentality is just as typical of modern societies as pre-industrial ones. For instance, Erik Erikson observes that the phenomenon of transference is as clearly understood and utilised by Yurok healers as by modern psychotherapists.38 In both cases a shift is effected from a domain of anxiety to a comparatively neutral domain (from focus on parent to focus on parent-surrogate, i.e. therapist), the second domain, however, corresponding to the first. Again, recourse to jargon and to 'experience-distant' concepts in the human sciences indicates how anxieties which arise in the course of research are alleviated through a shift to a neutral zone of abstract language or of number which, nevertheless, is held to correspond to the domain of human events. And modern consumer societies afford us insight into how the manipulation of 'things' such as cars, clothes, cosmetics, foodstuffs and houses assists a displacement of affect away from the domain of social relationships where anxiety and helplessness so commonly prevail. 139</page><page sequence="14">As for the world of scientific theory, one has only to consider the mechanistic imagery of thirteenth century philosophy (Turbayne 1962), the arboreal metaphor in nineteenth century palaeography, the topographical and archaeological imagery in psychoanalysis and in structuralism, the organic analogies in functionalist sociology (Leach 1961:6), and the metaphors of the mirror, the fountain and the lamp in literary theory (Abrams 1958) to agree with Jorges Luis Borges that the history of ideas may be nothing more than the history of a handful of metaphors. Furthermore, if, as Stephen Pepper argues,39 world theories are so often generated by drawing analogies from the immediate sensible world, might not adequacy in explanation be seen as a matter of choosing the right metaphor rather than a question of epistemological correctness. For, by revealing actual correspondences between the world of ideas and the world of things, a well-chosen metaphor may reveal an underlying truth which makes common-sense and so avoids the fallacy of misplaced concreteness. An excellent example of this kind of theory-building is given by Gregory Bateson who, in trying to visualise and understand processes of social control among the Iatmul of Papua-New Guinea, compared Western and Iatmul societies in terms of a contrast between radically symmetrical animals (like jellyfish and sea anenomes) and animals with transverse segmentation (like earthworms, lobsters and man) (Bateson 1973:50-51). The biological analogy got Bateson's thought moving in a new direction, and also revealed possible connections between the form of social and natural worlds. Immobilized Metaphor In what circumstances can anthropomorphic metaphors be said to be ill chosen, irrational or pathological? My argument has been that metaphorical instrumentality is not magical or irrational per se: on the contrary, it can be a way of healing, of making whole. But when metaphor becomes an end in itself and loses its instrumental value as a means of moving us among various domains of Being and a means of integrating these domains of Being, then it can become pathological. In these circusmtances, metaphor becomes fetishized; a person gets stuck on the metaphorical vehicle itself and, as in schizophrenia, plays endlessly with the associational possibilities of language, but always in a narrowly denotative and idiosyncratic way as though words were things. As Silvano Arieti notes, the schizophrenic takes metaphors literally.40 Metaphor thereby loses its value as a means of integrating many domains and, as such, ceases to be metaphor. But contrary to the view of Arieti and others who speak of'primitive' peoples and schizophrenics alike as trapped in a world of concrete thinking, confounding words and things,41 I hold that no a priori distinction between 'them' and 'us' is tenable on these grounds. Using metaphors as if they were real, as in the case of Yurok healers or in Dylan Thomas's poem, is a re-cognition of cosmic wholeness, not a sign that the person is stuck in one domain of the world, possessed by it and unable to move. Unlike the holistic and outgoing character of metaphorical thought, pathological thought is aholistic and autistic.42 Indeed, if we define madness in terms of a kind of existential immobility, in which a person can no longer move out into the world and where intelligiblity has no real connections with sensibility and sociability, then the following fragment from the autobiography of a schizophrenic girl could well describe much scientific writing and philosophy wherein metaphor is eschewed on the grounds that it is too concrete, too elaborate, or confuses that which should be distinguished.43 This was it; this was madness, the Enlightenment was the perception of Unreality. Madness was finding oneself permanently in an all-embracing unreality. I called it the "Land of Light" because of the brilliant 140</page><page sequence="15">illumination, dazzling, astral, cold, and the state of extreme tension in which everything was, including myself... In the endless silence and the strained immobility, I had the impression that some dreadful thing about to occur would break the quiet, something horrible, overwhelming. I waited, holding my breath, suffused with inquietude; but nothing happened. The immobility became more immobile, the silence more silent, things and people, their gestures and their noises, more artificial, detached one from the other, unreal, without life.44 Poetry as Therapy It is now possible to return to the role of anthropomorphic metaphor in poetry and consider it in the light of what I have argued so far, mainly by way of ethnographical examples. In Dylan Thomas's poem, In the white giant's thigh, two transformations take place. The first is an objectification whereby a shift is effected from the domain of individual anatomy to the comparatively neutral domain of landscape: the 'waded bay' at the mouth of the river Towy and a cemetery on the side of a chalk hill. The second transformation, a corollary of the first, is a scale reduction in which the individual body and the body of the earth are made to assume the same proportions. These transformations make the world of subjectivity thinkable and graspable. Landscape supplies an 'objective correlative' of personal and social concerns, the natural world being amenable because it appears to be on the same scale as the human world, and viable because it is in reality linked to events in the poet's life. In this way, a poem made with well-chosen metaphors can move us towards a recognition of a unity which for a time had seemed lost. A remarkable instance of this therapeutic power of poetry is recorded by John Stuart Mill in his Autobiography. When he was 15, Mill read Bentham for the first time and at once decided to devote his life to reforming the world. But five years later, in the autumn of 1826, he began to suffer serious misgivings about this project, and he put a question to himself, the answer to which plunged him into a deep crisis: Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?" And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered, "No!" At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. All my happiness was to have been found in the continual pursuit of this end .The end had ceased to charm, and how could there ever again be any interest in the means? I seemed to have nothing left to live for (Mill 1981:139). Mill's crisis was in part a realisation that his education under his father's hand had given him the means of attaining happiness, yet these means were not in themselves strong enough to "resist the dissolving influence of analysis" and actually make him happy.45 For I now saw, or thought I saw, what I had already before received with incredulity — that the habit of analysis has a tendency to wear away the feelings: as indeed it has when no other mental habit is cultivated, and the analysing spirit remains without its natural complements and correctives (Mill 1981:141). He saw that his intellectual upbringing had made "precocious and premature analysis the inveterate habit of (his) mind", "undermining" and "weakening" as he 141</page><page sequence="16">put it, a feeling for nature and for the "pleasure of sympathy with human beings". This profound disconnectedness of personal, social and natural aspects of his Being immobilised him for more than two years, and he describes himself as living in a state of "dry, heavy dejection", performing his intellectual tasks "mechanically". But gradually his malady lifted, first through a resolve not to make happiness a direct goal or necessary precondition of his existence, and second through cultivating what he calls "passive susceptibilities". In this endeavour, Wordsworth's poetry, which he first read in the autumn of 1828, was a revelation, reawakening a lost love of "rural objects and natural scenery" and helping him recover that disposition of mind which Keats called 'negative capability'. He describes Wordsworth's poems as "a medicine": They seemed to be the very culture of the feelings, which I was in quest of... I needed to be made to feel that there was real, permanent happiness in tranquil contemplation. Wordsworth taught me this, not only without turning away from, but with a greatly increased interest in, the common feelings and a common destiny of human beings (Mill 1981:151, 153). Through the poetry of Wordsworth, Mill recovered his wholeness of Being: the natural world of natural contemplation was the way he found his way back into social and personal completeness. Almost a hundred years later, Robert Graves, traumatised mentally and physically by his experiences in the 1st World War, discovered the same healing powers of poetry.and came to regard poetry as "a form of psycho-therapy", a mode of homeopathic healing (Stade 1967:12). In his critical essays, Graves emphasises the bodily aspect of metaphor, stressing how poetic rhythms can induce trance and so move a poet into those unconscious areas of Being where healing occurs of itself. It is interesting in this respect that Graves is one of the few writers on prosody who relate poetic meter to human activity and movement within the habitus. He plays up the practical role of the Nordic scop in both shaping charms for the protection of king and realm, and in performing such mundane tasks as "persuading a ship's crew to pull rhythmically and uncomplainingly on their oars against the rough waves of the North Sea, by singing them ballads in time to the beat" (Graves 1955:72). Thus, the slap of oars, the rattle of rowlocks, the ring of hammers on an anvil in a forge, the beat of feet around altar or tomb, or the ploughman turning at the end of each furrow (versus — verse) all indicate the practical environment of speech, sound and movement in which poetry originated. Because he gives such accent to the pragmatic and therapeutic power of poetry, it is not surprising that Grave's early poems frequently refer to walking, the relaxed momentum of which is, as we have already seen, often made a metaphor for social mobility and adequacy.46 In forging links between personal, social and natural worlds, and in reforging these links when we break them, poetry fosters wholeness of Being. But poetic metaphor also accomplishes this through a scale reduction in which social, natural and personal worlds correspond evenly, so allowing us to feel equal to the wider world. In this sense, poetry may be likened to the art of miniature painting. Here, as Levi-Strauss observes, "the intrinsic value of a small-scale model is that it compensates for the renunciation of sensible dimensions by the acquisition of intelligible dimensions" (Levi-Strauss 1966:24). Reduction in scale and objectification extend our power over a homologue of a thing, so allowing it to be grasped, assessed and apprehended at a glance. "A child's doll is no longer an enemy, a rival or even an interlocutor. In it and through it a person is made into a subject" (Levi-Strauss 1966:23). It is this existential aspect of metaphorical instrumentality which is, in my view, of paramount importance: the way metaphor allows individuals to participate in processes of cure or clarification while at the same time — because 142</page><page sequence="17">metaphors are drawn irom a communal stock and correspond with patterns of body use and disposition — affirm the essential unity of personal, social and natural domains of Being. To quote Wallace Stevens' Notes toward a Supreme Fiction: From this the poem springs: that we live in a place That is not our own and, much more, not ourselves And hard it is in spite of blazoned days. We are the mimics. Clouds are pedagogues. The air is not a mirror but bare board, Coulisse bright-dark, tragic chiaroscuro And comic colour of the rose, in which Abysmal instruments make sounds like pips Of the sweepting meanings that we add to them. Neither the air is mirror, nor is metaphor mere description, mere figure of speech or device of rhetoric. Against the prevailing anthropological view that 'natural symbols' like the body are simply the passive ground on which forms of social organisation are inscribed, and against the emphasis in much literary theory on the expressive and communicational aspects of metaphor, I have argued a case for studying metaphor in its instrumental aspects, and have endeavoured to show how such a view of metaphor might be seriously pursued. NOTES 1. Needham 1978:169. Aristotle was the firpt writer to use the word microcosm; in his Physics he asks: if something "can happen in the living being, what hinders it from happening also in the All? For if it happens in the little world (microcosm), (it happens) also in the great" (cited by Needham 1978:169). Contrary to the impersonal view of the body fostered by modern medicine, ancient notions of medical science favoured this correspondence theory. Thus, the Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) wrote: "Man has been truly termed a "microcosm", or little world in himself, and the structure of his body should be studied not only by those who wish to become doctors, but by those who wish to attain to a more intimate knowledge of God" (cited by Needleman 1975:39). And the Belgian physician, Andreas Vesalius, in the Preface to his disquisition On the Fabric of the Human Body, published in the same year as Copernicus's revolutionary work On the Revolution of Celestial Orbs ( 1543), wrote: "For this (human body) in many particulars exhibits a marvellous correspondence with the universe, and for that reason was by them of old not inappropriately styled a little universe" (cited by Needleman 1975:38). 2. See especially Coriolanus, Act I Scene 1, where Menenius's celebrated parable of the belly is beautifully exploited. 3. Poetry may in fact be defined as "the most concentrated form of verbal expression"; dichten (^condensare) is the German verb corresponding to the noun dichtung, meaning poetry. Thus poetry = to condense (Pound 1961:36). 4. This may be partly explained by the way that practical learning in preliterate societies is usually a matter of direct imitation and not mediated by books or abstract verbal descriptions. The Navaho view of language as embodied is not untypical: "in the beginning were the word and the thing, the symbol and the object" (Witherspoon 1977:46, my emphasis). This inseparability of knowledge and physical being is brought home by the Maori view that improper divulgence of knowledge can lead to physical wasting and death; cases are often cited of this happening in historical times (Tawhai 1981). 5. Calame-Griaule 1965:28. Cf. The Malinke where speech (kuma) is associated with various parts of the body (Camara 1976:237-249) and the Kuranko where the word kole (seed or bone) is used metaphorically of words and things, e.g. saan kole ('the deep sky"), dugu kole ('the bare ground'), kuma kole ('germane speech' i.e. the words and know-how of the elders upon which everyone's livelihood depends). 6. "In his correspondence, Thomas stressed that all ideas and actions began in the body. As a result, he insisted, the best way to render a thought or action, however abstract, was to express it in as physical a way as possible. Every thought, for him, could find an equivalent in blood, flesh, or gland. He saw it as 43</page><page sequence="18">his particular task to find and express all the equations between body and world, between body and idea" (Moynihan 1966:48). 7. See, for instance, James Fernandez who defines metaphor as "the predication of a sign-image upon an inchoate subject" (1974:120). "In the growth of human identity, the inchoate pronouns of social life — the "1", "you", "he", "it" — gain identity by predicating some sign-image, some metaphor upon themselves. These pronouns must, in Mead's ( 1934) terms, become objects to themselves, by taking the point of view of "the other", before they can become subjects of themselves" (1974:122). 8. E.G. "Metaphor is a device for seeing something in terms of something else. It brings out the thisness of a that, or the thatness of a this" (Burke 1945:503). In making his distinction between tenor and vehicle, I.A. Richards speaks of the tenor as "the underlying idea or principal subject which the vehicle or figure means" (1936:97). More recently, Lakoff and Johnson have observed that 'the essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another" (1980:5). 9. See, for instance, Fernandez who defines the study of metaphor as "the study of the way...subjects take objects unto themselves or are assigned them" (1974:133). 10. Thass-Thienemann (1968:370-371) offers a more involved explanation. 11. "Limits in the recognition of cognatic kin by reference to "joints", "little knees", etc., are already recorded in the folk-laws ( Leges Barbarorum) of the post-migration period (fifth to early ninth century). Thus the Salian Franks reckon "usque ad sectum genuculum", the Riparian Franks, "usque quinto genuclo", the Thuringians, "usque ad quintam generationem", the Lombards, Visigoths, and Baiuvarians, "usque in septimum geniculum". The differences are usually explained by variations in the mode of reckoning, e.g. including Ego as the point of departure so that the sibling represents the second geniculum, or beginning with the nearest collateral as the first geniculum" (Meinhard 1975:3). 12. See Thass-Thienemann 1968:283, and, for the significance of'curving act', 1968:277. 13. The Kuranko word for household or family is dembaiye (from demba: a mother breast-feeding a child) and the same root de, meaning 'mouth', occurs in the door of a house, bundon de, lit. 'granary mouth'. 14. Such thinking is not characteristic of everyday life in either nonliterate or literate societies, and Devereux has criticised Levy-Bruhl and Freud for their failure to recognise that crisis and stress are the universal pre-conditions for this kind of 'prelogical' thinking (Devereux 1939:332-333). Fernandez makes a similar point: "Even in supposedly sophisticated societies, men in situations of ambiguity or conflict return to likening each other and themselves to hawks, doves, or owls, dogs or their offspring, donkeys" (1974:122, my emphasis). 15. For instance, through alcohol and drug abuse, illness, domestic turmoil, exile, antisocial behaviour etc., which may explain why poets are often social misfits and negligent of their health, and why mystical experience is so often precipitated by illness or crisis. 16. Preliterate thought has been variously called animistic (Tylor, Piaget), paleological (Arieti), mythopoeic (Cassirer), prelogical (Levy-Bruhl), archaic (Eliade), primary process (Freud), often with pejorative implications. 17. In his sociological theory of schizophrenia (1939), George Devereux notes that schizoid mechanisms may be seen as attempts to adapt to the disorienting magnitude and complexity of modern societies where there is no real scale compatibility between the individual person and the social and technological worlds which lie beyond his complete knowledge and control. Anthropomorphic thinking is evidence of an endeavour to extrapolate from the familiar to the unfamiliar, a way of making the external world seem responsive and thereby manageable. Such thinking is often a central feature of schizoid thought which strives to control panic about the traumatic unresponsiveness of matter by interpreting physical processes animistically, i.e. on a par with the self (Devereux 1967:18-19, 32-33). While greatly indebted to Devereux's insights I do not accept that anthropomorphic thinking is necessarily erroneous. 18. See Brunton (1981:361-362) on the significance of "exchange roads" on Tanna (Melanesia), Willis (1977:279; 1978:143) on metaphors of pathways among the Fipa (Tanzania), and Janzen( 1978:169-171) on the Kongo (Zaire) correspondences between body and village. 19. Kuranko diviners sometimes refer to 'gates' — open or closed — which signify the status of relationships between a person and extrasocial agencies such as bush spirits or ancestors. 20. I have borrowed the term habitus from Mauss (1973:73) and Bourdieu (1977:72) and elsewhere elaborated upon the relationship between cognitive life and the environment of a way of acting (Jackson 1983). 21. Respectively ke dugu and musu dugu ('male/ground/area' and 'female ground/area'). That dugu suggests the embodied nature of this conceptual distinction is shown by the fact that the word means, in various contexts, 'earth', 'ground', 'place', and 'body'. 22. Seven days after a child is born it is brought out the front door of the house (if a boy) or the back door (if a girl). Among the neighbouring Malinke, gender distinctions are affirmed in a slightly different way, yet still based on the material habitus', at the birth ceremony a paternal uncle enters the house of the new-born child and comes out with the mother and child who has a bow around his neck (if a boy) or holds a kitchen utensil known as dogbala (if a girl) (Camara 1976:51). 23. See LeVine (1976:121-131) on this African pattern of characterising social relationships in terms of types of material transactions. It should also be noted that the Songhai use the metaphor of pathways 144</page><page sequence="19">only when treating the illnesses they describe as 'village diseases'. 'Bush diseases' involve a different habitus and so require different metaphors and elements in the therapeutic process (Bisilliat 1976:579). 24. House (Bachelard 1964:4; Bourdieu 1977:89-95; Zahan 1970:69-71); animals (Fernandez 1974:121 122); plants (Leenhardt 1979:16-20); machines (Laing 1960:22; Bettelheim 1959). 25. Fernandez refers to the behaviourist contention that "metaphor is the device men possess for leaping beyond the essential privacy of the experiential process" (1974:119), and cites Boas who observed that metaphors are often taken literally in rituals and made the basis of the rite, i.e. metaphors are not only rhetorical devices for persuasion but performative devices as well (ibid: 125). 26. See Jackson (1979) for more detailed discussion. 27. See Miller (1967:134-135) and Groddeck (1977:117) for clinical examples. Fisher (1970:537-538) suggests that women are more prone to leg anxiety than men; men are accustomed to moving out aggressively into the world while women are expected to stay put in the domestic domain. 28. See Devereux's superb account (1969:489-490) of Mohave patterns of psychosomatic illness. 29. Sontag 1977:3. For a healthier view see Guirdham (1957). 30. I am mindful here of the reified and static view of social structure which informs some of Mary Douglas's work on "natural symbols" (1973:93-112), and of the prevailing semiotic model, uncomplemented by any references to habitus, context of situation, or patterns of body use, which has dominated a lot of recent work on the anthropology of the body. For a fuller critique of this view, see Jackson 1983. 31. Cf. Devereux on the social construction of the idea of'spirit roads' and 'transferable souls' among the Sedang Moi (1978:271). 32. Cf. J.L. Austin's definition of performative utterances: "the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action — it is not normally thought of as just saying something" (1962:6-7). 33. As Devereux has shown, such transference also occurs in science. The Copernican revolution paradoxically offered a way out of emotional dilemmas: "By transferring anxiety-arousing internal and interpersonal conflicts to the vaults of heaven, man was able to take his distance fromthe problems besetting him and to speculate about them with some measure of objectivity" ( 1967:4). Devereux argues that the "stat. rat" has the same value for researchers in psychological experimentation (ibid). 34. See Horton (1967:167-172) on 'secondary elaboration' in African divination where various explanations and therapies are tried serially. By contrast, Janzen has shown ( 1978:200-201) another kind of pluralism among the Bakongo where people seek several different diagnoses and employ several different therapies simultaneously. 35. The diagnostic model suggested here closely resembles the taoist model which does not rank causes in a hierarchy or chain but explores the 'side-by-side' patterning of causes and the 'induction effect' which interrelates them within a unitary field, rather like the 'endochrine orchestra' of modern biology (Needham 1978:163-168). 36. Cf. Cassirer: "Whereas empirical thinking is essentially directed toward establishing an unequivocal relation between specific "causes" and specific "effects", mythical thinking...has a free selection of causes at its disposal. Anything can come from anything, because anything can stand in temporal or spatial contact with anything" (1955:46). 37. One notable exception is the Simonton's use of visualization and metaphorization in cancer therapy (Simonton 1980). 38. Erikson notes that if a child is ill a grandmother is often summoned to sing the ailment away. "American Indians in general seem to have a fine understanding of ambivalence, which dictates that in certain crises near-relatives are of no educational or therapeutic use" (1943:261). 39. Pepper on 'root metaphors' (1957:87, 91). 40. This "restriction to concreteness...prevents the patient from giving a metaphorical meaning to proverbs; they are interpreted literally or very concretely" (Arieti 1967:279). 41. Arieti 1967:280. Cf. Cassirer, who claims that in "mythical consciousness" "the image does not represent the thing; it is the thing; it does not merely stand for the object, but has the same actuality, so that it replaces the thing's immediate presence" (1955:38). My objection to this way of characterising preliterate thought is that it implies that preliterate peoples are somehow trapped by a propensity to confuse words and things. Anyone who has actually lived among preliterate peoples knows very well that this is nonsense, and that the concreteness and fusions in preliterate worldviews reflect an ethical preference for a philosophy that is conducive to community rather than individualism; it is an index of positive commitment, not of inadequacy or intellectual impoverishment. For a fuller critique, see Jackson 1978. 42. See Arieti (1967:286) for the notion of aholism (inability to perceive wholes; the disintegration of wholes), and Bettelheim (1959) for a remarkable account of an autistic child who was stuck with a view of himself as a machine. "Not every child who possesses a fantasy world is possessed by it. Normal children may retreat into realms of imaginery glory or magic powers, but they are easily able to make the return trip; they remain withdrawn, prisoners of the inner world of delusion and fantasy" (Bettelheim 1959:117). 43. Laing writes that people who regard themselves as automata, robots, bits of machinery or animals are crazy, "yet why do we not regard a theory that seeks to transmute persons into automata or animals 145</page><page sequence="20">as equally crazy?" (1960:22). One philosopher who accepts that metaphor has a place in philosophical discourse is Max Black, who argues that metaphor is "constitutive of meaning" and not merely an embellishment which can best be replaced by "plain language" (1962:46). 44. Sechehaye 1951:24, 25. The reference to the 'enlightenment' puts one in mind of the view of Horkheimer and Adorno (1973:3-42) that the dominance of scientific rationalism during the Enlightenment could only be achieved through a denial of the anthropomorphic view that man's body was linked to social and natural bodies. The associated splitting of the thinking subject — his personality and historicality — from discourse was also accompanied by a splitting of the physical body from Mind (Poole 1972:107-109). 45. Mill 1981:145. That Mill was struggling with unresolved oedipal conflicts is suggested by the fact that the only "small ray of light" that broke in upon his gloom during this period was a direct result of his reading Marmontel's Memoirs'. "I...came to the passage which relates his father's death, the distressed position of the family, and the sudden inspiration by which he, then a mere boy, felt and made them feel that he would be everything to them — would supply the place of all that they had lost. A vivid conception of the scene and its feelings came over me, and I was moved to tears. From this moment my burthen grew lighter" (Mill 1981:145). 46. Paul Valéry regularly used the rhythms of walking to bring him a "quickened flow of ideas" (Welsh 1978:12), and John Bowlby has pointed out, in his discussion of the soothing effects of rocking a baby, that the most effective rocking rhythm is sixty cycles a minute or above, i.e. 'the rate at which an adult walks' (1971:353).
