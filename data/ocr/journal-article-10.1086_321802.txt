      <p>Constructivist studies in recent anthropology have made an intellectual and moral contribution by repeatedly demonstrating that neither supposed races nor ethnic groupsor ethnies2are natural kinds in any biological sense. Biologists have reached the same conclusion (Boyd and Silk 2000). However, establishing the ontological fact may have clouded our understanding of local epistemologies. Anthropology today is faced with facts that are very embarrassing to current theorizing. The news is full of ethnic cleansing and genocide while anthropologists stress that ethnicity is invented and set out to decentre the notion (Levine 1999:165). We may be failing to take seriously that ethnic actors are themselves essentialists. Even though ethnies and races do not have essences, we still need to investigate why ordinary people often believe that they do and how this affects their behavior. Except for Hirschfelds (1996) pioneering work, anthropologists have ignored these questions (though concern with essentialism is growing in social science, particularly psychology [Haslam 1998, Miller and Prentice 1999]).</p>
      <p>In a recent assay of the relative value of constructivist and essentialist perspectives, Fischer (1999:473) communicates a perception that anthropologists eschew essentialist descriptions of ethnic groups as objects of analytical study but throw the baby out with the bathwater in failing to recognize essentialism as a selfevident worldview for most ordinary people:<disp-quote>
            <p>Essentialism is a dirty word in anthropology these days, used to denote an insidious neocolonial strategy of social containment.  scholars working in the constructivist tradition have forged an intellectually and politically liberating style of analysis built around antiessentialist critiques (Spivak 1987, 1994; Bhabha 1990, 1994; Gupta and Ferguson 1992; Garca Canclini 1995).  Despite its general disrepute within the academy, an essentialist view of culture underwrites many contemporary ethnic movements the world over.</p>
         </disp-quote>This statement sets up a contest between theoretical positions: some scholars defend the essentialist and others the constructivist view. Lately, it implies, there are more constructivists who abhor essentialists than the reverse. The represented contest is asymmetrical in other ways. Essentialists supposedly are naive <italic>naturalizers</italic> for whom ethnies are natural in a fundamental, ontological sense, and constructivists are supposedly <italic>analysts</italic> who in their wisdom recognize that ethnies are not natural but constructed. Constructivists boldly identify themselves, but their supposed opponents apparently publish no articles (cf. Fabian 1999:490)! But if constructivism is the only game in town and constructivists are talking to themselves about nonexistent foes, we need a more substantive target for debate.</p>
      <p>Constructivists are interested in how ethnies are put together. Postcolonial studies have enlightened us on the political and economic factors that encourage essentialism as an instrument in the social arena. Nevertheless, one hardly finds accounts of ethnic construction that do not refer us to a relatively long, intergenerational, and emergent process rather than realtime teleological calculations, and constructivists often appear to confuse the <italic>fact</italic> of ethnicgroup construction with a <italic>consciousness</italic> by ethnic actors of such constructive processes (GilWhite 1999). Ordinary people seem stubbornly oblivious to constructivist theorizing, and, despite extraordinarily different conditions of history and learning, they nevertheless appear everywhere cognitively predisposed to accept a biological illusion of essentialized naturalness for some of the groups they belong to. Thus, if essentialism is involved in ethnicgroup formation, then essentialism is one of the things constructivists try to understand (Fabian 1999:490)or ought to.</p>
      <p>The represented debate between constructivists and essentialists is, depending on context and author, either parallel or isomorphic to the represented debate between circumstantialists (a.k.a. instrumentalists) and primordialists. Circumstantialists see ethnies as the consciously <italic>instrumental</italic> (for political/economic gain) constructions of rational actors, whereas primordialists supposedly believe that ethnies are natural and eternal historical entities, with hermetically impermeable social boundaries. Once again, circumstantialists quickly announce themselves, but the primordialists they supposedly rise againstas caricatured hereare much harder to find, because, as before, they do not really exist. Once again, there is a confusion of one theoretical question with another: in this case instrumentalists confuse the (implausibly) instrumental construction/choice of an ethnic identity with the (more plausibly) instrumental choice to mobilize the identity politically. And once again we must ask why, despite the fact that ethnic groups are neither eternal nor naturally given, ethnic actors nevertheless represent them this way (the data we have suggest that they do so the world over [GilWhite 1999]).</p>
      <p>These days good anthropologists do not essentialize groups, and therefore no selfproclaimed essentialists are found in anthropology journals. But ordinary folk are not good anthropologists or sophisticated constructivist scholars. Quite to the contrary, they are naive essentialists, and I will try to explain why. This requires an effort that is ethnographic and cognitivepsychological. As Levine (1999:166) says, ethnicity is a poor concept unless we can describe and explain its cognition. Hirschfelds (1996) lead deserves to be followed, and the present effort is in that spirit.</p>

               <p>I prefer the term ethnie to the more common ethnic group because these are groups only in certain special cases. Generally speaking they are categories rather than groups of people, and the usage of the word group has served only to mislead theorists, who often appear to confuse, for example, processes such as ethnic mobilization with ethnogenesis.</p>

         <title>What Is a Group?</title>
         <p>The attempt to explain ethnic groups and ethnic cognition must situate itself relative to other social categories. What makes ethnic groups distinctive? How are they different from other social categories such as religion and class? In fact, <italic>are</italic> they?</p>
         <p>In psychology, although some distinctions have been made between socalled primary (facetoface) and other kinds of groups, the fields of stereotyping and group perception are strongly biased by the explicit or implicit assumption that the term group represents a scientific category (for a review of theory and evidence see Sedikides, Schopler, and Insko 1998). Thus, for example, a large literature has focused on groups with no history or content, formed in the lab on the slimmest and least ecologically valid of categorical distinctions (e.g., flipping a coin). In these experiments, allocators who (1) will suffer no material consequences from their decision and (2) distribute rewards with zero (or else very weakly symbolic) value have shown a demonstrablebut minusculebias favoring the ingroup (Tajfels [1970] celebrated minimumgroup paradigm experiments; for a review see Diehl 1990). These results are widely considered relevant to the explanation of processes of discrimination and conflict in more ecologically relevant social categories such as ethnic groups (Turner et al. 1987). However, recent experiments with ethnic groups, more realistic stakes, and a procedure that makes the allocators costs and benefits contingent on choices made by allocators show that allocators may favor the <italic>outgroup</italic> (GilWhite 2001<italic>a</italic>). And the ingroup bias in the original minimum groups is easily made to disappear with what appear to be minor framing variations (Mummendey et al. 1992). In sum, a straightforward application of the results of the minimumgroup literature to ethnic groups and other similar moves are valid only if group is a useful scientific category, which is likely to be true only if the astonishing variety of social distinctions that qualify for the label group are meaningfully unified in human perception and experience.</p>
         <p>Are they? The only theoretical effort to confront this issue headon, attempting to develop an encompassing gestalt theory of groups, originates with Campbell (1958). Campbell argued that a collection of individuals is perceived as a group to the degree that this collection has the characteristics of an <italic>entity</italic>. Out of this conceptual effort a recent but growing literature has constructed the following argument (Hamilton and Sherman 1996, Hamilton, Sherman, and Lickel 1998, Yzerbyt, Rocher, and Schadron 1997, Yzerbyt, Rogier, and Fiske 1998, Yzerbyt, Corneille, and Estrada 2001): Social categories fall somewhere along an entitativity continuum, with some being more entitative than others. Since individual humans are the prototypical entities and since they are essentialized, social categories that are high in entitativity are processed by analogy as individual persons and, as a result, become essentialized. The attribution of this category essence is then used in causal reasoning to explain the behavior of the members of the social category, leading to the emergence of social stereotypes. Properties taken to contribute to the perceived entitativity of a social category are proximity, similarity, and common fate of its constituents and structure among them.</p>
         <p>This argument is not without problems. The concept of entitativity needs conceptual clarification, and the empirical tests typically pit not a highly against a less entitative social category but rather a social category against an <italic>aggregate</italic> (Yzerbyt, Rogier, and Fiske 1998 is a case in point, but so are most of the studies in their review). It is unremarkable that differences in processing will be found between aggregates and social categories, and the exercise sheds no light on the impact of entitativity on essentialism and stereotyping. At an intuitive level, it seems implausible that entitativity is closely related to essentialism: firms, for example, are highly entitative, but they are not essentializedand they are characterized by much weaker stereotypes than much less entitative social categories such as ethnic groups. This paper will present evidence that the entitativity of a social category does not predict that it will be essentialized. Finally, the use of the word essence in the above literature is selfconsciously derived from the categorization literature and its recent focus on naturalkind categories; however, the claim of essentialism among the above authors appears implicitly to have become a standin for stereotyping or causal reasoning even though these are not the same thing. The usage does a disservice to the explicit pedigree of the term essentialism. After all, one can use a predictive stereotype for a social category without seeing it as an essentialized <italic>natural</italic> kind.</p>
         <p>What about the alternative to the gestalt approach? Perhaps there is specialized mental machinery for processing particular social categories in distinct and relatively discontinuous ways. This hypothesis flows naturally from the categorization literature, which has gotten much mileage from focusing on the structure of <italic>categories</italic> as a window into the way in which the brain parses the world. The focus here is on the different assumptions and biases, as part of an integrated <italic>schema</italic>, that particular categories activate or <italic>prime</italic> and what such cleavages of cognition reveal about the modular and evolved design of the human brain. Particularly interesting here is the distinction between natural and artifact categories, which are processed in different ways (Rosch 1978; Rosch et al. 1976; Keil 1989; Gelman and Markman 1986, 1987; Gelman and Wellman 1991; Gelman and Medin 1993; Medin and Ortony 1989). Some have taken this as an inspiration to argue that certain social categories are processed more like natural kinds and other social categories more like artifacts (Rothbart and Taylor 1992, Hirschfeld 1996). My own argument is in this vein.</p>
         <p>I will argue (cf. Tooby and Cosmides 1992, Pinker 1997) that domains important to our survival and reproduction in the past have probably selected for machinery specifically dedicated to processing the domainrelevant inputs. Each of these dedicated mental organs or modules is described in a cognitive sense (not necessarily implying <italic>physical</italic> brain modularity) as a set of processing biases and assumptions activated by the domainrelevant inputs. If this view of the brain is useful for understanding most domains of perception and cognition (see Pinker 1997), then we should hardly expect social groupings to be the exception, and we should investigate any interesting discontinuities in our perceptions of social units. In particular, we should investigate possible mental machinery specific to processing ethnies.</p>
         <p>Incidentally (and puzzlingly), evolutionary and cognitive scientists have, by and large, not made this sort of argument for social group perception and have limited their proposals to a domaingeneral categorization and stereotypeformation faculty and to an also relatively domaingeneral hypothesized groupish adaptation as evidenced in Tajfels experiments (e.g., Pinker 1997:31213, 51314). The exception is Hirschfeld (1996), who has advanced the argument and interesting evidence that the cognition of phenotypic categories (i.e., socalled race groups) is modularin particular, that it is essentialist. (However, Gelman and Hirschfeld [1999] now argue for a more domaingeneral essentialism not tied to any particular kind of group and responsible for all sorts of essentialisms, from the fetishism of certain objects to the perceived naturalness of certain social categories.) More recently, Lickel et al. (2000) have tried to identify the broad cuts in an intuitive taxonomy of groups.</p>
         <p>I will defend the hypothesis that ethnies (and similar social categories) are processed by the machinery which evolved to deal specifically with natural living kinds of the folkspecies ranklevel such as <sc>bear</sc> or <sc>mouse</sc>. Other social categories will typically not be processed in this way.</p>

         <title>The Ugly Duckling Hypothesis</title>
         <p>Cognitive studies with children (see Gelman 1996 for a review) and ethnobiological work in anthropology (Medin and Atran 1999, Atran et al. 1997, Atran 1990, Berlin 1992, Brown 1984, Hays 1983, Hunn 1977, Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven 1974) increasingly support the hypothesis that there may be a universal cognitive adaptation for processing living kinds as categories endowed with essences. This claim is still controversial (for exchanges on this question see Gelman and Hirschfeld 1999; Hatano and Inagaki 1999; Au and Romo 1999; Atran 1995, 1998; Maffie 1998; Matan and Strauss 1998; Carey 1985, 1996), but there is no space for that here. I will present evidence for the hypothesis, accept it provisionally, and go on to build the further hypothesis that humans think about ethnies with the same evolved, essentialist machinery that processes the biological world. I introduce here an outline of the argument.</p>
         <p>Important aspects of specialized biological thinking are displayed in the familiar tale <italic>The Ugly Duckling</italic>. A swans egg accidentally falls into a ducks nest and is incubated to term by unsuspecting Momma Duck, who, following gestation, raises it. Everyone, including the adventitious hatchling itself, takes it for a duck (even if all agree that it is an ugly one). In time, it grows into an obvious swan, revealing everyones mistake.</p>
         <p>What is the moral of the story? Superficially, the importance of reserving judgment because appearances may deceive. The baby swan was wrongly called an ugly duckling on the basis of appearance, but it laughed last after turning into a beautiful adult swan (by implication far superior to a mere duck). But more interesting than the explicit lesson are here the unnoticed <italic>assumptions</italic> (unconsciously taken as obvious givens) that allow the story to work. The egg came from a swans nest, so its parents were swans, and therefore no amount of duck rearing can turn the hatchling into a duck; it will develop normally as a swan no matter what it learns and no matter what others think it is or even what the duckling itself thinks it is. It is a swanthat is its <italic>nature</italic>.</p>
         <p>Like most fables with anthropomorphic animal characters, <italic>The Ugly Duckling</italic> is not, I suggest, really (or merely) about ducks and swans. Its replicative success across time evidences its efficiency and relevance: it is a simple parable of human life. Moreover, underneath the explicit moral is a story about the effects of rearing environment on ones livingkindderived naturethat is, none. Its passive acceptance as a plausible story suggests that we find it incontrovertible that if animal A rears animal B, this will not turn the latter into anything other than a B. Could the metaphorical implicationthat ones ethnic nature is also a matter of blooddescent rather than enculturationbe equally plausible to humans?</p>
         <p>Consider a modern example: The Weimar Jews were quite assimilated to German society in speech, custom, and dress, had fought as Germans in World War I, and, without relinquishing a Jewish identity, often considered themselves genuine Germans. But in the ensuing antiSemitic rampage not merely those who preserved Jewish ascriptions and traditions for themselves but even those with a small fraction of Jewish ancestry (sometimes as little as oneeighth) were slated for persecution. Nazi antiSemitism openly essentialized its victims, attributing to them a corrupt nature. Not all were convinced by this ideology to the point of justifying the persecution of Jews, but the question remains: Why was it so plausible to Nazi converts that even a little bit of Jewish bloodunknown perhaps even to their bearers and against all the powers of German enculturationwould pass on this supposedly corrupt nature? Perhaps because we intuitively process ethnic groups as if they were species, reasoning implicitly that the corresponding nature is passed down reproductively and, hence, in the blood.3</p>
         <p>If humans come equipped with mental machinery for naively processing ethnic groups as species, this is obviously a grave mistake from the scientific point of view. An ethnic socalled nature, after all, is nothing if not a set of <italic>culturally transmitted</italic> norms and behaviors, and therefore believing these literally to result from biological descent is an ontological error. But a bad ontology may be a useful epistemology. Suppose that (1) people have cultural norms very similar to those of their parents, (2) the norms of their parents are those of their ethnic group, (3) norms differ rather sharply across ethnic boundaries, and (4) ethnies are at least normatively endogamous and fairly endogamous in practice. If these obtain, treating an ethnie as a living kind will generate the right behavioral prediction most of the time: your nature (the norms you automatically and sometimes even unconsciously adhere to) is a function of your kind (the ethnie you belong to), which in turn is the kind of your parents (since ethnies are largely endogamous). Keeping track of these kinds is important, for attempted interactions with aliens with different standards of performance will more likely lead to failed than to mutually profitable interactions. In the case of the Weimar Jews, manyperhaps mostof their interactional norms were no different from German norms, but the argument is that what <italic>primes</italic> this form of thinking is perception not of norm differences but of an endogamy boundary, which then promotes the <italic>assumption</italic> of natural differences.</p>
         <p>The hypothesis that humans have evolved to process ethnies as species relies on the following assumptions and argument:</p>
         <p>1. Humans have sociallearning biases for conformism (Miller and McFarland 1991; Kuran 1995; Asch 1956, 1963[1951]), and these create locally centripetal forces in culture that tend to give stability to a given populations norms (Boyd and Richerson 1985; chap. 7; Henrich and Boyd 1998).</p>
         <p>2. Even groups living in the same environment can stabilize different clusters of interactional normsrulelike ideas that govern how individuals will transact social exchanges of all sorts (i.e., the rules of the game [cf. Barth 1969]). Different equilibria are possible because, for many domains, that all members follow the same rules is vastly more important than their specific content (e.g., driving on the left or the righthand side of the road).</p>
         <p>3. Interacting with people who do not share ones norms creates significant fitness costs because the game of reciprocity is more difficult to play when the players have different expectations and rules. Humans have evolved to be sensitive to these costs (Robert Boyd, personal communication).</p>
         <p>The argument is as follows: The evolution of conformism as a sociallearning adaptation led to the emergence of local cultures stabilized for parochial norm equilibria (see assumptions 1 and 2), that is, localized and distinct ways of playing the games of social life. Interaction beyond the norm boundary is costly (in time and energy wasted) because coordination is difficult when interaction partners are playing different games or have different rules for the same game. Humans should be sensitive to such costs (see assumption 3). People learned through trial and error to interact preferentially inside the norm boundary, particularly when mistakes are especially costly, as in the case of the marriage of ones children (which in simple, prestate societies establishes longterm reciprocal and political relationships between inlaws). As a result, the norm boundary became, over time, synonymous with the ideological boundary of endogamous preferences. A corollary of thisgiven that interactional norms typically can be truly mastered only if acquired during early developmentis that good performers of the groups norms were almost always those descended from other group members. This led to the illusion that biological descent <italic>caused</italic> such performative mastery and would thus have tended to link full membership in the norm group with descent. Given the importance of norm boundaries for interactional decisions, norm groups acquired salient labels for ease of reference and discrimination. Finally, because interactional discriminations are adaptive to all concerned, there was an advantage in broadcasting group membership in order to signal what set of norms one adhered to and thus facilitate such discrimination. This led to ethnic signaling through dress, scarification, etc. (McElreath, Boyd, and Richerson 2001).</p>
         <p>In sum, the above processes ultimately endowed emergent ethnic groups with all of the salient and diagnostic characteristics of a species: (1) a distinctive morphology (the ethnic signaling component), (2) many intercorrelated hidden properties (the stable norm equilibrium), (3) withincategory mating and descentbased membership, and (4) saliently labeled categories in cultural discourse. Thus, in Sperbers (1996:chap. 6) terms, given preexisting mechanisms for recognizing species and processing them in particular ways, emergent ethnic groups very likely met the input conditions that primed such mechanisms, becoming part of the actual domain of the livingkinds mental module. When a human perceived an ethnie, it counted it and processed it as a species. Over time, because processing ethnies in this manner yields similar adaptive benefits to those which obtain in species reasoning (see below), the brain evolved to improve the fit and make ethnies part of the proper domain of the livingkind module, completing the <italic>exaptation</italic>.4</p>
         <p>Allport (1954) first suggested that reasoning about ethnies was essentialist but provided only a vague description of what he meant. Atran (1990:74, 78) and Boyer (1990, 1994) briefly hinted that ethnic and racial essentialism could result from <italic>biological</italic> domain reasoning, but they did not develop an argument or make a strong adaptationist case. The argument I have summarized claims that our brains process ethnies as species <italic>on purpose</italic> because, in the ancestral environment, this was adaptive. One can, of course, accept the empirical claim that humans essentialize ethnic groups while rejecting my explanation for it. Hirschfeld (1996:2126, 35, 116, 160, 175) and Gelman and Hirschfeld (1999) have specific disagreements with claims that ethnic essentialism is the product of biological domain thinking and provide an alternative account (see below).</p>
         <p>If it is true that we naively and intuitively process ethnies as species, this is likely to improve our understanding of the behavior of ethnic actors in different contexts. This is an increasingly urgent concern of anthropologists, sociologists, and political scientists, for obvious reasons. In these literatures, the prejudice of circumstantialists (a.k.a. instrumentalists) is that ethnies are socially constructed as people rationally follow their associative interests. But if ethnies recruit their members, mate, behave, and perceive each other as natural living kinds, then they are not constructed from the individual political decisions of rational actors in relatively short timescales. They are constructedthough not for that any less real, mind youwith ideologies of descentbased membership that constrain the constructive process. The present argument thus supports some of the prejudices of primordialists (see GilWhite 1999).</p>

         <title>Natural Kinds in Context: A Brief History of Categorization Theory</title>
         <p>If a radically constructivist view of ethnic categories is correct, we should expect such categories to be fuzzy and malleable, for otherwise the project of constructing them in political timescales would fail. Ethnic actors should see membership in an ethnie as ambiguous and negotiable. In contrast, if ethnic actors are essentialists, they will represent ethnic categories as having nonnegotiable necessary and sufficient conditions of membership. However, the issue of fuzziness in categorization is not straightforward, and I must preempt an important and tempting confusion: the idea that the fuzziness of a category may be established from fuzzy guesses when people sort perceptual stimuli (see also GilWhite 2001<italic>c</italic>).</p>
         <p>Critical to species categories, I will argue, are necessary and sufficient conditions of membership. An X is an X is an X. But knowing this does not mean that we always know an X when we see oneat least not at first. We may initially guess wrong but, upon learning relevant background facts, recognize our mistake and revise the initial classification. What this implies is that appearances may guide our fuzzy guesses when we try to sort new stimuli into categories but that these same appearances willin the case of species categoriesnot impose themselves on our concept representation, which is unequivocal rather than fuzzy.</p>
         <p>In our fable, consider that despite a different appearance, the ugly ducklings family nevertheless considered it a duck because they believed it a descendant of Momma Duck. Because they thought they knew its descent, appearance was irrelevant. The moral of the story makes the converse point: even if it talks like a duck and walks like a duck (albeit an ugly one), it could very well still be a swan. Thus, initial guesses may fail, but having established descent, we will confess our mistake and revise our categorization completely (i.e., the ugly duckling is not even <italic>partly</italic> a duckit is not a duck at all).</p>
         <p>Similarly, though people may make fuzzy guesses when assigning people to ethnic categories (if they have imperfect background information about them), this is fuzziness and ambiguity in <italic>identification procedures</italic>. It does not imply ambiguity in <italic>concept representation</italic> (category structure) if the fuzziness disappears when people are given the missing information. Claims by constructivists that ethnic categories are fuzzy (ambiguous, malleable, etc.) may result from confusing identification with representation (see GilWhite 2001<italic>b</italic>). Below I briefly review how these insights about species categories evolve out of a recent revolution in cognitive psychology. Following that, I present Mongolian data on ethnicgroup cognition for comparison.</p>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>From Classical Categories to Fuzzy Ones</title>
            <p>From the time of Aristotle until recently, all categories were thought to have necessary and sufficient conditions (Smith and Medin 1981:chap. 3) and hence to be abstract containers, with things either inside or outside the category (Lakoff 1987:6). An object is always either A or not A. This is known as the classical view, and it has been challenged of late.</p>
            <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953:6667) recently developed the concepts of family resemblances, centrality, and gradience. The members of some categories (e.g., <sc>game</sc>), he noted, did not all have certain properties in common, and for them no set of necessary and sufficient conditions could establish category membership. The English category <sc>religion</sc>, for instance, includes such things as Shintoism, shamanism, and even Confucianism, at one end, and Islam, Tibetan Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism at the other. The promotion of a moral code, magic, stereotyped rituals, belief in supernatural entities, belief in the afterlife and the soul, priesthoods, and creation stories are all <italic>characteristic</italic> of <sc>religion</sc>, but tokens of the class which lack any of these can be found. Not one item in the list is a defining (necessary and sufficient) property, though some may have greater weight than others. Thus, an object is a member of the category if it possesses some critical sum of these weighted features.</p>
            <p>Beyond membership, some members may be more <italic>typical</italic> of the category than others. Notice, for example, the misgivings of an expert on shamanism (Humphrey 1996:49):<disp-quote>
                  <p>For a time it seemed to me best to write a book somehow without the words religion or shamanism. Religion seemed wrong for ideas and beliefs which are never set out as general theory and make use of relatively few abstract concepts, for which there is no holy founder, no organized institution, no moral dogmas, and no authoritative corpus of books. Above all, there is no tortuous justification of earlier beliefs enshrined in ancient texts.</p>
               </disp-quote>In Humphreys intuitions and those of most competent Englishspeakers, practices that are institutional, theological, prophetic, historicized, and moral<italic>in addition</italic> to being ritualized, magical, and supernaturalare more comfortably religion. Nevertheless, ritualized practices that attempt to influence and codify reverence for supernatural forces (without the above additionse.g., shamanism) still strike us as somehow religion, if less comfortably so. Islam, then, is a central or more typical member of the category, whereas shamanism is not. Rosch and Mervis (1975) gave experimental meaning to family resemblances, showing that <italic>typicality</italic> for a token member results from having more of the more common features in the set (which can be generalized as a higher sum of the weighted features).</p>
            <p>Finally, some categories are characterized by gradual membership. For example, crisply separating <sc>poor</sc> from <sc>rich</sc> is impossible, and the same goes for <sc>young</sc> versus <sc>old, blue</sc> versus <sc>green, tall</sc> versus <sc>short</sc>, etc. Some people are clearly young (babies) and some old (nonagenarians), but the boundaries of such categories are not clear. To age is, as it were, <italic>gradually</italic> to lose membership in the category <sc>young</sc> and gain it in <sc>old</sc>.5 Zadeh (1965) began the work of integrating fuzzy sets into a general settheoretical framework.</p>
            <p>Eleanor Roschs empirical and theoretical work, with that of others, revolutionized the way we think of categories and led to the current understanding that not all categories have the structure A or not A. She introduced the term prototype to stand for the cognitive reference point or most central member (or subcategory of members) of a category and demonstrated the corollary prototype effects: some members of a category are learned, recognized, etc., more easily, which is consistent with their being more <italic>representative</italic> or <italic>typical</italic> of the category (Lakoff 1987:41). At first category structure was inferred directly from these prototype effects, but Rosch (1978) eventually recognized that demonstrating prototype effects did not, in fact, reveal category structure, as different concept representations may be consistent with the same prototype effect.</p>
            <p>For example, if we establish that some tokens of a category are more typical because people tell us they are better examples of the category or because these tokens are identified more quickly, does this show that the category in question has a probabilistic structure such as <sc>young people</sc>? That is, will some category members have higher percentual membership (e.g., be <italic>younger</italic>) than others? Not necessarily. Armstrong, Gleitman, and Gleitman (1983) examined typicality ratings and reaction times for members of the category <sc>odd number</sc> and found that subjects indeed felt that some numbers, such as 3 or 7, were more <italic>representative</italic> of <sc>odd number</sc> than others, such as 109 and 2,003. However, if subjects are asked directly whether typical odd numbers are or can be <italic>more odd</italic> than atypical ones, they will flatly deny it (Keil 1989:30, my emphasis). This result shows that even classical categories with necessary and sufficient conditions, such as <sc>odd number</sc>, may show typicality effects.</p>
            <p>Rosch (1978:4041) cogently argued that the demonstration of prototype effects constrained the range of possible category structures to those which could account for them but in the same breath maintained that necessary and sufficient conditions could not. As we see above with the case of <sc>odd number</sc>, however, it seems that they can, and so classical categories may not be as rare as was initially believed when prototype effects began proliferating (Medin and Ortony 1989). Typicality effects are not incompatible with newer understandings of classical categories, for they may result from <italic>processing during identification</italic> of members rather than concept representation (Smith and Medin 1981:4043, 5760). Thus, though some token members may be considered more typical and therefore be processed better and recognized more quickly, it is still possible that for some categories membership is a yes/no distinction. Natural kinds, despite demonstrable prototype effects, appear to be classical categories with necessary and sufficient conditions of membership.</p>

            <title>Natural Kinds as Classical Categories</title>
            <p>Lockes (1964[1690]) distinction between nominal and real essences has led to one between nominal and natural kinds (Keil 1989:3637). Nominal kinds reflect more or less arbitrary conventions of usage or else have definitions based on their purposes for human use (e.g., artifacts such as <sc>pencil</sc>), whereas natural kinds (e.g., <sc>fish</sc>) at least carry the intuition that they carve out important causal domains and processes in the natural world. When natural kinds are revisedor rather, when we revise our ideas about which objects out there in the world should be excluded from, or included in, a natural kindwe feel this less as a definitional shift than as a gain in understanding of the category itself, whose definition we <italic>discover</italic> rather than arbitrate.6</p>
            <p>In natural kinds typical appearances defer to our intuitions of deep, nonobvious explanatory properties causally responsible for category inclusion. Consider that humans seem ready to accept, if the information is conveyed by an expert source (e.g., a biology teacher), that a dolphin is not a <sc>fish</sc>, even though a cursory inspection suggests that it is. Similarly, we happily leave fools gold to fools, even though we ourselves need an expert to decide which is which. Artifact categories, however, are a different matter; try to imagine someone accepting the statement by a librarian that what looks like a book is really a magazine. Malt (1989) has systematically investigated these intuitions and found that for borderline cases on the basis of appearance, people feel that they need experts to sort natural kinds, but with artifacts such cases are felt to be a matter of opinion (e.g., the statement According to experts, this is a shirt is silly, but According to experts, this is a fish is not).</p>
            <p>Criteria of identification (i.e., appearances) supplyfor most instances (and in particular those typical of the category)a roughandready way of guessing that an object is inside the category (if it looks like a duck, well guess duck). The guesses (1) are probabilistic, (2) are graded by the number of categoryrelevant characteristics that are readily apparent in a given object, (3) imply judgments of typicality, and (4) will generate prototype effects. However, just as in <sc>odd number</sc>, these effects do not imply fuzzy or ambiguous definitions, for appearances do not determine criteria of inclusion in natural kinds (Gelman and Markman 1987:1532):<disp-quote>
                  <p>Natural kinds are categories of objects and substances that are found in nature (e.g., tiger, water, cactus).  natural kind terms capture regularities in nature that go beyond intuitive similarity.  Natural kinds have a deep, nonobvious basis; perceptual features, though useful for identifying members of a category, do not always serve to define the category. For example, fools gold looks just like gold to most people, yet we accept the statement of an expert that it is not gold.  Because natural kinds capture theorybased properties rather than superficial features, some of the properties that were originally used to pick out category members can be violated, but we will still agree the object is a member of the kind if there is reason to believe that deeper, more explanatory properties still hold.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Because in natural kinds we seem to privilege something deeper than mere appearances, some have proposed that we intuitively conceive of inner essences:Almost everyone has had the intuition that things are not always what they seem and that there is something deeper and more basic to a kind than what is immediately apparent. One way to capture this intuition is to argue that things have essences that are often difficult to discern immediately (Keil 1989:36). Thus, inclusion in a natural kind follows from a necessary and sufficient conditionpossession of the essence (or, by extension, from evidence of <italic>meeting the conditions for having the essence</italic>). Surface characteristics are responsible for typicality effects but not category inclusion, for we treat the former as the typical <italic>manifestations</italic> or <italic>consequences</italic> of the essence rather than direct evidence of essence possession. What this implies is that the categories are not fuzzy even if our appearancebased guesses may sometimes be. For species categories, Keil (1989) has demonstrated that young children faced with gradual pictorial transformations of one species into another (e.g., lion into tiger) are very reluctant to designate an animal as simultaneously belonging to both. They <italic>will</italic> consider the animal to have been transformed, but this happens abruptly, for the children saw the animals as fully changing in kind across the critical pair of adjacent pictures (1989:23742). This suggests that even fuzzy transformations cannot overwhelm a strong intuition that the categories are not fuzzy.</p>
            <p>All of the preceding arguments apply to both naturalkind substances such as <sc>gold</sc> and natural <italic>living</italic> kinds such as <sc>mouse</sc>. What is specific to the cognition of species categories is our intuitions about (1) how the category essence is acquired/transmitted, which has implications for (2) how it can be established that something has one essence rather than another. In species categories, the possession of an essence of X, I argue, promotes a strongly held intuition that one mates with X and produces Xs in reproduction. Thus, whether a token has an essence of X answers to the questions (1) Does it produce Xs in reproduction? (2) Is it descended from Xs? and (3) Does it mate with X?</p>

         <title>Identification Versus Categorization in Mongolia</title>
         <p>My study population consists in the main of Torguud seminomadic pastoralists (a small Mongol ethnic group in western Mongolia). They move around in the district of Bulgan Sum, Hovd, Republic of Mongolia, and winter near the district center, a town on the Bulgan River. The town has about 2,500 inhabitants, some of them farmers on the periphery. Beyond is the desertsteppe, where about 5,000 nomads eke out a living. The Bangyakhan clan winters in a large floodplain valley of the Bulgan River not far from the district center. Some male herders make regular twoweek trips out into the Gobi, where the snow is less thick and the sparse grass more accessible, but a few (perhaps 15%) remain fully nomadic even during the winter. They also assist their livestock with fodder collected in late August/September. In the summer months they move to high ground, in the Altai Mountains, changing their location constantly as pastures are depleted (they may make as many as ten moves in a fourmonth period). The high ground is very green highaltitude foreststeppe crisscrossed by innumerable glacial rivers and streams. Apart from Torguuds, there are other Mongol ethnic groups in the area, as well as a large population of Kazakhs (perhaps 30% of the local population), with the greatest local ethnic contrast being that between Mongols and Kazakhs. Although there are a few Kazakh families in what is essentially Torguud territory, on the whole Torguuds and Kazakhs are territorially segregatedeven Torguud and Kazakh town dwellers live in separate parts of town.</p>
         <p>This site was chosen because it offers desirable controls for a number of variables. Since I intended to study essentialism, I worried about plausible confounds that could lead people to give essentialist answers (race, class, ecology/occupation, religion) and thus cast doubt on the interpretation that respondents were reasoning about ethnic categories per se. However, all of the plausible confounds are accidentally controlled for in this site. In terms of phenotype, the two groups have overlapping distributions without a sharp phenotypic cline (see GilWhite 2001<italic>b</italic>). Thus it is unlikely that local actors essentialize the ethnic groups because they are faced with sharp phenotypic or racial differences. Class is also not an issue, because there is no socioeconomic structural ranking of the groups. In terms of ecology, both groups include nomads and town dwellers, and the pastoral nomadism of the two groups is much the same, right down to the species they herd. Finally, the two local religions (Tibetan Buddhism among Mongols and Islam among Kazakhs) are both proselytizing rather than essentializing religions (unlike, say, Judaism or Hinduism). Any essentialism found in this site is thus more likely related to the nature of ethniccategory cognition than to local correlates of ethnicity.</p>
         <p>The questionnaire I constructed for the study was as follows:</p>
         <p>1. If the father is Kazakh and the mother Mongol, what is the ethnicity of the child?</p>
         <p>2. The father is Kazakh, the mother Mongol, <italic>but</italic> everybody around the family is Mongol and the child <italic>has never even seen a Kazakh</italic> outside of the father. The child will learn Mongol customs and language. What is the ethnicity of <italic>this</italic> child?</p>
         <p>3. A Kazakh couple has a child that they dont want. They give it in adoption to a Mongol couple when the child is under a year old. Around the Mongol family there only are Mongols, and the child grows up <italic>never meeting or seeing a single Kazakh</italic>. He is never told of the adoption <italic>and thinks that his biological father and mother are the Mongol adopters</italic>. He grows up learning Mongol customs and language. What is the ethnicity of <italic>this</italic> child?</p>
         <p>I administered this questionnaire orally to 59 Torguud subjects in 1997 and then to an entirely new sample (again of Torguuds) of 41 subjects in 1998, varying the methodology slightly to explore what might have been possible confounding biases in the first experiment. In the 1998 replication the biological parents were Mongol and the adopters Kazakh, the child was female, and the questions were randomized. Only question order seems to have mattered. In 1997 the order was deliberately designed to <italic>inhibit</italic> primordialist answers and provide a stronger test. It appears to have worked, because randomization increased descentbased ascriptions in question 3 for the 1998 sample (fig. 1; see GilWhite 2001<italic>b</italic> for details).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>The responses to question 1 show that Mongols (like other pastoralists) are patrilineal (Khazanov 1994:143). However, this usually refers to clan and subclan ascription and material inheritance; here we see that fathers also transmit ethnic ascription. The question was open in that they were not forced to choose among predetermined options,7 but in another sense it was forced by presuming that children have an ethnic status at birth. However, if respondents considered membership a matter of ones absorbed culture, perhaps they should have objected that it depends and explained on what. No such answer was ever given.</p>
         <p>The wording in question 2 pits the patrilineal rule against enculturation in an ethnic outgroup, presenting a descentversusculture conflict. In question 3 there are absolutely no ties, except for the fact of birth, to the biological parents. The answers to questions 2 and 3 show that my respondents categorize the child according to descent. In question 3 this implies that one can be an X and not know it (<italic> la The Ugly Duckling</italic>). This is especially clear in 1998, where the randomized questions do not imply to subjects (as the 1997 sequence 1, 2, 3 does) that I expect and want enculturationbased answers. The prevalence of descent in question 3 rules out a rearing patrilineal model.</p>
         <p>Of particular importance here is that biological descent is for most a necessary and sufficient criterion of inclusion, even though members are typically <italic>identified</italic> by recourse to prominently displayed cultural traits. When the adopted child is called a Mongol (1998 sample) this is despite the fact that my informants agree that the child will not look or behave anything like a Mongol and thus will violate the phenomenological expectations associated with a Mongol. The child may thus be human fools gold. If she existed, a naive local traveler would doubtless classify her as Kazakh. But learning that the biological parents were Mongol would lead to a revision of the guess and a recognition that surface features had misled one as to the deeper, more explanatory properties (much as the baby swans foster siblings at first mistook it for a duck). Thus, we see here the same disjunction between identification procedures and categorization criteria that occurs with natural kinds. Since the deeper explanatory properties concern issues of biological descent, we appear to be dealing here with a speciestype category. I do not believe that these results from Mongolia are idiosyncratic; the ethnographic literature suggests that all over the worldno matter how culturally marked ethnic actors may bethe rule for making ethnic ascriptions is based on blood much more than on enculturation (GilWhite 1999).</p>
         <p>Some may object that perhaps my informants are reasoning not about ethnic groups but about what they believe are races. Hirschfeld (1996) has shown essentialism in the cognition of race. There are some problems of comparison because of differences in the details, but one of Hirschfelds manipulations was an adoption situation very similar to mine, and his results amount to finding that children reason that race will be unmodified by early adoption into the outgroup familythe same interpretation I have given to my results. I think that my respondents <italic>do</italic> racialize the ethnic groups, but we must then explain why this occurs even when there are no sharp phenotypic differences (Hirschfeld was testing the starkest possible contrast, the white/black distinction). I initially chose Bulgan Sum in part because phenotypic differences between local Kazakhs and Mongols seemed few and I wanted to test peoples reasoning about <italic>ethnicity</italic>, controlling for phenotype (among other natural controls), and see if results similar to Hirschfelds could be obtained. I conducted an initial pilot test in 1998 and a more rigorous study in 2000 (see GilWhite 2001<italic>b</italic>) to see if people could distinguish Kazakhs and Mongols on the basis of appearance. This study found so much overlap that local phenotypic differences are probably not responsible for racialist thinking. To know for sure, we need a negative result in experiments such as Hirschfelds using physical differences of the order found in Bulgan Sum.</p>
         <p>A final point concerns the issue of fuzziness. The first and second questions present respondents with an opportunity to say that the child is an ethnic mix. However, the issue was resolved one way or the other, and overwhelmingly with patrilineality. The exceptions confirm the rule. A few respondents in the first study answered that the child was <italic>erliiz</italic> (halfbreed). Subsequent investigation yielded the clarification that he was a <italic>Mongol erliiz</italic> and not of mixed ethnicity. The term <italic>erliiz</italic>, then, though translated as halfbreed, connotes mixed ancestry but not mixed ethnicity (the concern with not allowing mixed ethnicity is a common phenomenon [see Nave 2000]). This too speaks of a reluctance to see the category boundary as a fuzzy one.</p>

         <title>The Species Essence in Human Cognition</title>
         <p>One could argue that so far there is no demonstration of Torguuds processing their local ethnic categories as species. What the data show is that one assumes the ethnic ascription of ones biological parents. It could be that, for them, an ethnic group is simply a descent group and that the question What is the childs <italic>ndesten?</italic> (<italic>ndesten</italic> is the Mongolian word used to describe groups at the level of contrast between Mongols and Kazakhs8) is understood simply as What is the childs descent group?, as in Which group is he/she biologically descended from? Indeed, the root morpheme of <italic>ndesten (ndes)</italic>means root. To show that ethnic groups are processed as natural kinds one must go beyond the above evidence to show that putative essences are attached to the labels. I will provide such evidence, but, for it to be appreciated, we must first consider how species essentialism works.</p>
         <p>Most of the cognitive psychological work on human reasoning about living kinds has been conducted in Western settings with Westerners. More crosscultural work is needed, but what little we have is suggestive. Giyoo Hatano and Kayoko Inagaki have done much important work with Japanese children (see Hatano and Inagaki 1999); there is also a study done with Yoruba adults (Jeyifous 1986), and Atran (1998; Atran et al. 1997) has compared the livingkind cognition of Itzaj Maya and Americans. This work is so far consistent with the hypothesis that many important aspects of livingkind cognition constitute human universals. I describe below what I take these universal features to be.</p>

            <title>Psychological Essentialism</title>
            <p>Relative similarity has no objective basis because an infinite number of things can be predicated of any object and therefore unconstrained comparisons between objects A, B, and C cannot tell us which two are more similar (Goodman 1972, Watanabe 1969). Thus, the similarity we see between any two things depends entirely on what our brains consider material and immaterial about themwhat matters is not the shared predicates but the <italic>represented</italic> shared predicates. For example, both tennis balls and shoes share the predicate not having ears, but it is unlikely that this predicate is part of our representation of either tennis balls or shoes (Medin and Ortony 1989:182). Medin and Ortony speak of psychological essentialism as the stance that places two objects in the same category if they are believed to share the same constitutive and inalienable <italic>hidden essence</italic> (even when they are superficially different). They believe that this is what governs category inclusion in natural kinds.</p>
            <p>The argument does not commit us to the belief that essences actually exist. For some natural kinds, such as substances and elements, chemical or atomic constitutions may qualify as legitimate essences, but the Darwinian revolution made it clear that biological natural kinds cannot be characterized as having real essences (Mayr 1964). In any given population, for any given genetic locus, either (1) there is variation now or (2) there will be variation at some point in the future, and such variation does not ipso facto force an unusual variant or mutant out of the category which names the population (in fact, typically it does not).9 However, we may nevertheless think in essentialist terms. Psychological essentialism is a claim about peoples categorization processes, not about the world these processes organize; it is not the view that things have essences, but rather the view that peoples <italic>representations</italic> of things might reflect such a belief (erroneous as it may be) (Medin and Ortony 1989:183).</p>
            <p>Medin and Ortony argue further that the description of an essence may be a complete mystery to us, but this is no detriment to essentializing a category, for we will simply assume that the essencewhatever it isis there. They call this assumption the essence placeholder (1989:18485), and they note that it forces a way of conceptualizing the category: whatever category members look like and do, it is <italic>because</italic> of that unseen underlying essence or nature (whatever it is).</p>

                  <p>Macromutations, or chromosomal mutations (e.g., the accidental doubling of the number of chromosomes during reproduction, as seems to have happened for some plant species), can lead to spontaneous speciation, but the overwhelming majority of speciation processes are gradual. Even punctuated speciation is gradualit is just rapid compared with periods of stasisand even with macromutations we cannot know in advance what sorts of changes will justify naming a new species, which is always a post facto maneuver (notice, for example, that some humans, e.g., Down Syndrome individuals, have more or less than the total number of chromosomes typically found in humans without being any less human. Thus, as modern biologists, we cannot really pretend that an essence is specifiable for any biological species.</p>

            <title>Essences and Development in Living Kinds</title>
            <p>Gelman and Wellman (1991) investigated how the assumption of an underlying essence may create expectations about development in living kinds. Will children take species membership to imply an innate, developmental potential? A tiger cub has the potential to grow into something large and fierce, even though when born it is small and helpless. To explain developmental changes of this sort, we as adults often appeal to something like an intrinsic category essence that is responsible for how they grow  the belief in an essential nature or a determining but [at an early age] nonmanifest predisposition (1991:230). Gelman and Wellman presented children with examples of animals (e.g., tiger) that were raised with other kinds of animal (e.g., horses) in the complete absence of their own kind. In responding to questions concerning the form and behavior of these animals as adults, children relied more on category than on environment. For example, they answered that a tiger raised with horses (and never having seen another tiger after the early transfer) would display tiger traits and behaviors as an adult rather than horse traits and behaviors. Children seem aware that the nature of an animal is relatively impervious to the environment of development and that adult traits and behaviors not present in the earlier stages of ontogeny are the product of the animals intrinsic developmental program rather than elicited by, or acquired from, an environment of conspecifics already exhibiting the traits and behaviors in question.</p>
            <p>This is the central point of the <italic>The Ugly Duckling</italic>.

            <title>Essences and Reproduction</title>
            <p>How is a livingkind essence acquired? To what extent do we see the process of reproduction as uniquely responsible for transmitting a species essence? A partial answer emerges from a test conducted to determine the importance of appearance in species categorization. Rips (1989) had a sample of adults listen to a story about a sorp, a flying animal equipped with feathers, which makes nests, etc.everything typical of a bird. This sorp falls into some toxic waste and is transformed: it sheds its feathers, acquires transparent, membranous wings and a brittle, iridescent outer shell, etc.everything typical of a flying insect. The transformed sorp eventually meets a <italic>normal</italic> female sorp and mates, and this leads to the laying of eggs which produce normal sorps. When subjects were asked to classify the transformed sorp on a scale from 1 (insect) to 10 (bird), they rated it a 6.5 (i.e., most thought that the transformed sorp was more likely to be a bird than an insect). Asked whether it was more typical of an insect or a bird, they rated it a 4, and asked whether it was more like an insect than a bird they rated it a 3.5.</p>
            <p>This shows, first of all, the independence of similarity and categorization. If participants in this study were merely comparing the features of the transformed sorp with those of the concept bird to see whether there was a critical mass of matches (as in, e.g., Collins and Loftuss 1975 spreadingactivation model or Smith, Shoben, and Ripss 1974 featurecomparison model), they would have concluded that the transformed sorp was not a bird. Second, it shows the importance of what I believe is the necessary and sufficient condition for categorization in a natural living kind: biological descent. Despite the transformation, the strange sorp is nevertheless the offspring of normal sorps and produces normal sorps in reproductiontherefore, it is still a bird and not an insect. An interesting modification to Ripss experiment would perhaps add asexual reproduction yielding transformed offspring. I predict that respondents would in this case say the transformed sorp was an insect (experiments currently under way will answer this question).</p>
            <p>Whereas Rips tested adults, Keil (1989:chaps. 8, 9) conducted experiments pitting descent relations against appearances with children and found that by age 10 they had strong intuitions that membership in a species category is a matter of descent, regardless of current appearance or transformations. Yoruba adults in Nigeria, with no exposure to Westernstyle schooling in biology, reasoned similarly (Jeyifous 1986). It seems that descent from a species member is taken as necessary and sufficient for possession (through inheritance) of the biological kind essence and that one property assumed of any biological kind essence is ability to reproduce the kind.</p>

            <title>Essences and Insides</title>
            <p>Gelman and Wellman (1991:215) carefully distinguish between insides and essences as follows:<disp-quote>
                  <p>The insides of an item are the matter residing physically behind or under its outer layer (e.g., the bones, heart, and blood of a dog, the stuffing and wires of a chair). Insides are concrete and ultimately observable, yet typically remain unobserved. An essence is the unique, typically hidden property of an object that makes it what it is.  Essences generally are never observed, and in fact may remain unknown .</p>
                  <p>Both insides and essences are difficult to define precisely. Do a dogs insides begin under the fur, under the skin, under the flesh, or indeed even interior to the skeletal framework?  Essences are often unspecifiable, and by their nature require an inference about some deeper organization or disposition.</p>
               </disp-quote>The distinction is salutary because humans probably do not equate the insides with the essence as if they were coextensive. However, it seems very likely that we think of essences as somehow <italic>located</italic> inside. Whatever it is that makes a thing what it isits essencewe imagine it not as lying on the surface of the thing but as somehow inside it, even though we may deny that the essence amounts to nothing more and nothing less than the things insides.</p>
            <p>Simons and Keil (1995) have shown that young children know very little about the insides of living things (although they do anticipate that the insides of living kinds will be natural and different from those of artifacts). Moreover, childrens understanding of how the insides are related to biological function is completely unspecified, as was the same understanding for adults before the development of modern biology. And yet, Gelman and Wellman (1991) found that with insidesrelevant items, including species categories, children reason that the function changes when the insides rather than the outsides are removed and that identity is more likely to change when the insides rather than the outsides are removed. This is consistent with the idea that they believe the essence is inside and that removing the insides will take the essence with them, thus altering the nature of the thing. Earlier studies by Keil (1989:21731) show that children will entertain that interventions can transform an animal from one kind to another if the intervention involves the insides rather than merely the outsides. The interview transcripts strongly suggest that insides are critical to speciescategory membership.</p>

         <title>Are Torguuds Essentialists?</title>
         <p>To show that Torguuds are essentialists, the data must reveal their cognition of groups such as Kazakhs and Mongols to share important similarities with the features of essentialism described above, provided we can agree that the preceding section presents a plausible picture of species essentialism.</p>
         <sec id="sc6.1">
            <title>Torguuds on Development</title>
            <p>A sample of hard primordialists in the 1998 study (i.e., those who, even in question 3, believed that ascription depended only on the ethnicity of the biological parents) were asked an additional question (GilWhite 2001<italic>b</italic>). I reviewed the details of question 3 (which in the 1998 study has Kazakhs as the adopters) and then asked, This adopted child, will he become <italic>exactly</italic> like the Kazakhs, or will he be somewhat different?</p>
            <p>When respondents answered that the child would be somewhat different (a common locution was No, he cant/wont become <italic>exactly</italic> like the Kazakhs), I asked, How will the child be different? Almost invariably, the response to this was that the childs features would be like those of a Mongol, revealing that subjects had understood the question as it was intended, in terms of similarity to Kazakhs <italic>as a group</italic> and not to the adoptive parents in particular.10 Then I asked, And how will the child <italic>behave</italic>? Will the child behave <italic>exactly</italic> like the Kazakhs, or will he behave somewhat differently? A majority of respondents (17 of 23) replied that the child would behave not quite like the Kazakhs but somewhat like a Mongol.</p>
            <p>This suggests that, in addition to believing ethnic ascriptions to result from descent, Torguuds consider this to be more than mere labeling of ones ascent. Apparently, being a Mongol or being descended biologically from Mongols implies resisting enculturation into an outgroup to a certain degree, even when such enculturation is all one knows and even when one has had no contact with the group from which one is biologically descended. This is consistent with believing that a Mongol, by virtue of being descended from other Mongols, has a Mongol essence which confers an innate potential that will play itself out developmentally on its own steam, as it were (as in Gelman and Wellman 1991). The intuition that the adopted child will be different and behave somewhat differently remains despite the fact that my subjects accept the extreme premise, namely, that the child in question 3 will have learned Kazakh language, norms, habits, and customs and will have had not the slightest exposure to Mongols and no awareness of Mongol descent.</p>
            <p>I also asked a small sampleall primordialists in question 3after how many generations of intermarrying the adopted childs descendants in the male line would become Kazakhs. The answers ranged from two generations to never, but the samples of essentialists (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and nonessentialists (<italic>n</italic> = 6) are here much too small to draw conclusions. However, one observation appears significant: fully half of the essentialists responded that the child would <italic>never</italic> become a Kazakh, and this was the modal response for this group. In contrast, not one of the nonessentialists gave such an answer. This suggests that essentialism is connected to an intuition of intrinsic nature and therefore inalterability.</p>

            <title>Conscious Theories and Intuitive Theories</title>
            <p>As my fieldwork progressed and I experienced peoples beliefs outside the rigid context of the interview format, I came to believe that my questionnaires were good tools for revealing peoples <italic>conscious</italic> but not their <italic>intutiive</italic> theories. I use the term intuitive theory to substitute for theory or naive theory as the term is used in cognitive psychology, where it refers to the organizing and constraining (but subjectively unnoticed) content that underlies human concepts and categories. By conscious theory I mean an elaborated belief that organizes knowledge and that the individual is aware of having. The responses my questions elicited, I submit, result from an interview context that forces people to use their conscious theoriespresumably the joint result of their cultural upbringing and their personal experiencesin a very explicit way. In a previous paper (GilWhite 1999) I called conscious theories regarding the ethnic membership charter ethnic transmission and acquisition models. That my questionnaire investigates such models and not intuitive theories is no cause for despair. Conscious theories are important evidence, and a theory that human cognition is innately designed for <italic>intuitive</italic> processing of ethnies as natural living kinds makes the nontrivial prediction that a majority of cultures in the world will turn out to have bloodbased models of ethnic transmission and acquisition. However, if the design of the human brain is what we are after, conscious theories can be misleading, for they typically do not <italic>replace</italic> our intuitions (cf. Atran 1990:x). For example, it has been demonstrated that, when thinking intuitively, people who understand a law of statistics which is in conflict with their innate biases for interpreting probabilities and distributions will use the innate bias, although they will recognize that they have made a mistake when the problem they were asked to consider is rephrased in terms of the statistical law (Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982:49597). These mistakes are errors of application. In what follows I recount a few anecdotes that uncovered such errors.</p>
            <p>My friend Tsoloo (Tsohlh) is a bright 21yearold Torguud who served as my guide in one of my brief forays into Kazakh territory. He was never formally subjected to my questionnaire (except for the essentialism questions), but he developed a keen interest in my research; he watched me administer the questionnaire to many Torguuds, Uryankhais, and Kazakhs and shared his views of their answers with me. Tsoloo is what I call a circumstantialist, and a vociferous one. To him, the right answer to question 3 is that the child is a member of the <italic>adopting</italic> ethnie. He also insisted repeatedly that the right answer to my question Will this adopted child be <italic>exactly</italic> like the [adopting ethnie] or somewhat different? is that the child will be <italic>exactly</italic> like the adopting ethniehow could it be otherwise? It bothered him considerably that many people gave essentialist answers. To him it was all quite simple: if you have the customs of an ethnie and live with them, you are a member of that ethnic group, and if you are raised by that ethnie from birth you will be no different from them no matter who your parents are. He is even a <italic>hard</italic> circumstantialist, that is, a rationalchoice theorist, who maintains that adults can choose to make the ethnic shift by living with and acquiring the customs of another ethnie.</p>
            <p>But this was when we were talking about my questions; when discussing other topics, he often seemed like an essentialist. For example, he is afraid of the Uryankhai because he believes they can all cast curses. The Kazakh can also cast curses, according to him, but cannot be touched by anybodys curses because of their strong religion, Islam. (This makes them theoretically more dangerous than the Uryankhai, but in fact they are supposedly less prone than the Uryankhai to cast curses because they are not bad people.) Now, of course, one could argue that this is all compatible with his circumstantialism because he may believe that being able to cast curses like an Uryankhai or a Kazakh and being more or less welldisposed towards others is a matter of being a good Uryankhai or Kazakh performer in cultural terms and of being reared amongst people with certain views. In fact, he listed the impossibility of putting curses on the Kazakhs as an example of their being <italic>buruu nomtoi</italic> (with the wrong book, where book is a euphemism for culture). But these conversations somehow never <italic>felt</italic> circumstantialist to me.</p>
            <p>I was wondering about these things one day as Tsoloo, his friend Tulgai (also a circumstantialist), and I crept on our horses up to the barren and rocky mountaintops in order to cross back into Torguud country. To investigate the matter, I initiated the following exchange:</p>
            <p>Tsoloo, I have a question: if I learn the Uryankhai customs, can I then put curses on people like an Uryankhai?</p>
            <p>No, you cant.</p>
            <p>Why not?</p>
            <p>He paused. You have to be Uryankhai.</p>
            <p>But you said that if I had the customs of an ethnic group I would be a member of that ethnic group. So why cant I cast curses like an Uryankhai if I learn all their customs? I was explicitly reminding him of the model he had resorted to when considering my questionnaire and therefore stacking all the odds against his persisting with an essentialist answer.</p>
            <p>You cant, he said.</p>
            <p>Thats right, you cant, joined Tulgai.</p>
            <p>Well, why not?</p>
            <p>Tsoloo paused for a second and said, You  have to be born to an Uryankhai. The two were agreed on this point.</p>
            <p>So unless one of my parents is Uryankhai, I cant put curses on people?</p>
            <p>True.</p>
            <p>That means that if I was adopted at any early age by the Uryankhai, I would be just like them but I would not be able to cast curses </p>
            <p>True.</p>
            <p>Is it the same with the Kazakhs?</p>
            <p>The same.</p>
            <p>At this point Tulgai rode off to kill a marmot, and Tsoloo and I were left alone to continue our conversation. I paused for a second in order to consider what a tantalizing contradiction Tsoloo had just provided and how completely unaware he was of it. Had he been any other circumstantialist it would have been striking but not <italic>this</italic> striking. Tsoloo had seen me administer the same questionnaire at least a dozen times, and we had discussed it together and thought a lot about it. And only a few hours before I had administered the questionnaire twice with him present. Yet, he was completely unaware that his current answer was at variance with the position he had been explicitly maintaining all along, and the fact that my last question closely mimicked the question I actually use to probe essentialism did not clue him to what was going on. Tsoloo was not thinking theoretically; he was thinking <italic>intuitively</italic>. I was very excited at this insight but instead showed myself mockingly upset.</p>
            <p>Tsoloo, you lied to me, I said with a wink and a smile.</p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>Because you have been telling me all along that if a child is adopted from birth into another ethnie he will be just like the adopting ethnie. But that is not what you think. Suppose that the child born of Mongol parents and adopted by Kazakhs was a Torguud Mongol. Well, then he would be a lot like the Kazakhs but not exactly like them, because he would not be able to cast curses. You see?</p>
            <p>Oh ! He looked down at his horse and took his free hand to his mouth in thoughtful expression I had seen many times. An embarrassed smile crept over his face, and then he looked at me, nodding with a smile that he accepted defeat graciously.</p>
            <p>You actually think that child would be a little bit different, but that is not what you told me when we talked about my experimental questions.</p>
            <p>Yes  yes, I see. Aha  He looked up the road with a curious expression. He seemed to be pondering the intricacies of his own mind.</p>
            <p>Let me ask you this: if an Uryankhai child was adopted by Torguuds, just as in question 3, would he be able to cast curses or not?</p>
            <p>Well [a significant pause] that child doesnt know that his real parents are Uryankhai  he would be <italic>able</italic> to, but he wouldnt know it.</p>
            <p>I see. If he knew, he might cast curses, but since he doesnt, he wont.</p>
            <p>True.</p>
            <p>I paused again, then explained a difficulty. This is a problem for my research, Tsoloo. You gave an answer based on <italic>customs</italic> when I asked you the experimental question, and you said the child would be exactly like the adopting ethnie. But thats not what you really think. What if other people who answered like you also think like you? You seem to believe the adopted child will look and talk exactly like the adopting ethnie, and yet  and yet, you believe that the child, <italic>inside</italic>, is somehow still different.</p>
            <p>Yes, yes. Thats right! He seemed excited that I had chosen just the right words to explain his thoughts. (I had of course carefully chosen those words.)</p>
            <p>Maybe some of the people who answered like you also think this way, that the child is somehow still different <italic>inside</italic>.</p>
            <p>That is what they <italic>all</italic> think, he said, very convinced.</p>
            <p>You think so?</p>
            <p>I am sure.</p>
            <p>Notice that, in Tsoloos mind, to have that thing which confers the hidden potential of an A and which is inside, you have to be a biological descendant of an A. Later, thinking about our conversation, Tsoloo confided in me that he had made a mistake and amended his explicit views about cursing to coincide with his conscious model.</p>
            <p>I considered using my conversation with Tsoloo as a template to structure informal conversations with others in order to test intuitive essentialism. This proved impossible because such an instrument requires that others agree with Tsoloos premise that Uryankhai can all cast curses, etc., and there was too much variability in this domain of belief.</p>
            <p>My data on Kazakhs are of much lower quality than those for the Mongols because I spent less time with them and at first I did not realize that one had to remind them explicitly that the child in question 3 would acquire both Kazakh culture <italic>and</italic> religion. However, I think I can safely claim that Kazakhs are, by and large, circumstantialists (as measured by my questionnaire) so long as they understand that the adopted child will become a Muslim in addition to assuming the other aspects of Kazakh culture. Kazakhs in Xinjiang, China, told Bessac (1965) that the children they stole from Mongolian and Tibetan communities were fully Kazakh upon their conversion to Islam, and the Kazakhs I worked with had immigrated only a generation ago from Xinjiang.</p>
            <p>However, here too I found that conscious models and intuitions can differ. When I asked Kazakhs alone, a majority was circumstantialist. On one occasion, however, at a <italic>bayr</italic> (party), a large group of Kazakh old men took an interest in my research, and I asked the questions publicly of the whole group. The old men answered in chorus, and they turned out to be heavily circumstantialist and not at all essentialist. But there was one lone dissenter, a young man, who protested furiously and gave contrary, primordialist and essentialist answers each time. Later, while I was pondering how interesting it was that the Kazakhs should be ascriptive circumstantialists, a large circle of young men sitting to my right began protesting furiously to me that what the old men had been saying was not true. Prominent among them was the lone dissenter from the earlier choruses. Apparently he was nowhere near being alone, merely the only one who had the courage to withstand the embarrassment of appearing publicly as a deviant. Another young man was also quite angry and doing a lot of talking. The argument was familiar: the child was a Mongol because the biological parents were Mongol. Her culture did not matter in the least. I turned to them and said,</p>
            <p>So I, for instance, can never become a Kazakh? If I stayed here and learned Kazakh and Kazakh customs, married a Kazakh girl, and became a Muslim, I would still not be a Kazakh?</p>
            <p>One spoke for all of them when he replied, Even if you do everything like a Kazakh, and everybody says you are a Kazakh, you still arent a real Kazakh because your parents are not Kazakh. You are different inside. And he pointed to his chest. All the others were nodding. That girl in your question, you know? Everybody would say that she was a Kazakh, but she would not be a real Kazakh.</p>
            <p>My main interlocutor and I talked about other things for a while, and then I brought us back.</p>
            <p>Can I ask you another question?</p>
            <p>Okay.</p>
            <p>You say that I can never become a Kazakh even if I convert and do everything like a Kazakh, because my parents are not Kazakh, true?</p>
            <p>True.</p>
            <p>But is this also true for the girl in my last question? Is it true for the girl who is adopted at a very young age?</p>
            <p>Yes. People will say that she is a Kazakh, but she is not a real Kazakh.</p>
            <p>Because her parents are not Kazakh?</p>
            <p>Exactly.</p>
            <p>She is also different inside? I pointed to my chest.</p>
            <p>Thats right.</p>
            <p>This time I had not been the one to supply the word inside. And this time too, being an X inside was a matter of being descended biologically from X. When I was back at Khurmets (my 22yearold Kazakh hosts) yurt, I had him alone for a moment, so I asked him,</p>
            <p>Isnt it interesting that the young guys thought so differently from the old guys?</p>
            <p>Yes, he said with a quizzical smile.</p>
            <p>Tell me something: when I asked you my three questions the other day, you answered like the old guys. The young guys told me it was true that the adopted girl would be called a Kazakh but did not agree that she would be a real Kazakh because she was different inside. What do you think? Do you think the girl will be a real Kazakh?</p>
            <p>He thought for a second and then said, This is what I think: I think that the girl is Kazakh <italic>ndesten</italic> like I said before</p>
            <p>But is she <italic>jinkhene</italic> [real] Kazakh <italic>ndesten</italic>?</p>
            <p>Yes. I think she is <italic>jinkhene</italic> Kazakh.</p>
            <p>And you think she will be exactly like Kazakh people?</p>
            <p>Yes. She will be exactly like Kazakhs  but  I also think, you know  that she will be different inside. He pointed to his chest just as the other man had done. Inside she is a Mongol, he concluded.</p>
            <p>Astounding, I thought. Khurmet thought she was a <italic>real</italic> Kazakh but a Mongol inside. A contradiction? Perhaps. Apparently Khurmet has a conscious theory of what makes a real Kazakh, but <italic>intuitions</italic> are different. They tell him that the girl in my example would still somehow be different inside, despite all outward appearances and ascriptive practices. These experiences convince me that the formal questionnaires significantly underestimate the degree to which people are <italic>intuitively</italic> inclined to think about ethnic groups in essentialist terms.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sc6.3">
            <title>Ethnie as a Privileged Category</title>
            <p>Do other descent categories show similar essentialism? If all do, then there is nothing <italic>particular</italic> about ethnies, as distinct from other descent categories. Some have argued that ethnicity is just kinship writ large, and van den Berghe (1987:[1981]) has presented the most complete statement. But if ethnicity is not primarily processed as a kinship category (merely being occasionally rendered as one for the purposes of mobilization), then there should be differences in the processing of ethnic and kinship categories.</p>
            <p>The Torguuds of Bulgan Sum divide themselves into five <italic>khoshuun</italic>,11 which have most of the properties usually associated with clans. Each is a named group (Bangyakhan [my host community], Taajinkhen, Beelinkhen, Khovog, and Khoshuud); membership requires biological descent from other members; each has a sacred totem (a mountain) particular to it; each is small enough that everyone knows everyone else; and the members occupy a common territory. I am unaware of any putative eponymous ancestors,12 and there are no rigid rules of clan exogamy. In fact, the clans are highly endogamous, and it is virtually impossible to find two people among the Bangyakhan who are not related to each other in one way or another. The exogamous units are named patrilineages <italic>within</italic> the clans, called <italic>omog</italic> (although many people lost track of which <italic>omog</italic> they belonged to in communist times). To investigate whether clans are processed as are ethnic groups, I presented 14 individuals with the setup for question 3 but substituted clan names for the ethnic groups. The childgiving family was Bangyakhan and the adopting family Beelinkhen. All the other details were the same: the child did not know of the adoption, never met any Bangyakhan, learned Beelinkhen customs, and would speak with a Beelinkhen accent. Then I asked, Will this child be <italic>exactly</italic> like the Beelinkhen, or will she be somewhat different, somewhat like the Bangyakhan? I had earlier pretested, with a different sample, to see whether most Bangyakhan thought that there were cultural differences among the clans. Almost everybody in that sample did, even though they considered them very minor and were absolutely incapable of listing them (except for noticeable differences in speech to which I can attest myself and perhaps some wedding songs).</p>
            <p>A very interesting thing happened: question 3 suddenly became very difficult to understand. Every time I asked the question Will this child be <italic>exactly</italic> like the Beelinkhen, or will she be somewhat like the Bangyakhan? people began talking about <italic>individual</italic> differences. This answer was typical: Well, she will have the biological parents face and character, but everything else will be like the adoptive parents. It was very hard to make them see that the question had to do with being exactly like the Beelinkhen (versus somewhat like the Bangyakhan) <italic>as a group</italic>, rather than exactly like the adoptive Beelinkhen parents versus somewhat like the biological Bangyakhan parents. This is a misunderstanding that virtually <italic>never</italic> occurred (perhaps no more than twice) when the categories used were Mongol and Kazakh. The novel difficulty is in itself telling. Moreover, every single time I finally succeeded in conveying the meaning of the question as I intended it, my subjects responded that the child would be exactly like the Beelinkhen.</p>
            <p>On one occasion, I administered the question to my friends Tmrbaatar, Mukhtar, Batskh, and Tsoloo. They all answered nonessentially. My furious scribbling piqued their curiosity, so I explained that I was interested because people didnt always answer like this when the groups used were Mongol and Kazakh, instead of Beelinkhen and Bangyakhan. Seeing is believing, so I asked the question again but with the original Mongol/Kazakh setup (which these respondents had never heard). This time my four respondents split two ways. Tmrbaatar and Tsoloo gave nonessentialist answers (but see above for a deeper examination of Tsoloos thoughts), and Mukhtar and Batskh gave essentialist answers. Mukhtar, in particular, was adamant: there was no <italic>way</italic> a child of Mongols adopted by Kazakhs could become exactly like the Kazakhs. Both essentialists agreed that the child would speak and have Kazakh customs but insisted that her thoughts and character would be Mongol.</p>
            <p>Batskhs answer illustrates the distinction well. Later I went up to him and asked:</p>
            <p>Look, you initially told me in the clan question that the child would take after the biological mother and father in terms of character, but is that a <italic>Bangyakhan</italic> character or the character of the biological mom and dad?</p>
            <p>Biological mom and dad.</p>
            <p>Okay. And you also told me in the Mongol/Kazakh question that the child would not become just like a Kazakh, but would have a Mongol character. But is that a Mongol character or just the character of the biological mother and father?</p>
            <p>A Mongol character. Then I asked him to clarify the clan question again for me so that he could see precisely the distinction I was after. His answer did not change.</p>
            <p>I conclude that ethnies are not processed as large kin groups (though they are often popularly <italic>rendered</italic> as such, and this is interesting). Kinship seems to prime schemas that deal with individually varying differences such as one will find in the personalities of different individuals <italic>within</italic> an ethnie. Ethnicity seems to prime essentialism about qualities general to all members of the kind.</p>

                  <p>Many Torguuds in Bulgan Sum are descendants of immigrants from neighboring Xinjiang and therefore probably descendants of Torguuds who migrated from Central Asia to the Volga steppes around the year 1600 and then back to Jungaria (in modern Xinjiang) in 1771 with other tribes, collectively known as the Kalmyk. Most of those who returned to Jungaria were Torguuds (Khodarkovsky 1992:232). Krader (1963:11) said that there was a transition from genealogical to named clans among the Kalmyk in the early 20th century, but he was writing about the Volga Kalmyks who remained in Russia. Since the descendants of those who returned also now have named rather than genealogical clans, it is possible that this transition occurred much earlier.</p>

         <title>Why Should Ethnies Be, Cognitively, Species?</title>
         <p>I have made an empirical case that Torguuds essentialize ethnies in the manner of species. If this is a panhuman proclivity of our psychological <italic>design</italic>, as I claim, then natural selection must have favored it. I will argue that there are good reasons to believe this. First of all, species essentialism motivates inductive generalizations about hidden properties, so that we will assume that anything <italic>nonobvious</italic> learned about one beaver, say, will be true of all beavers. This is adaptive because beavers in fact <italic>do</italic> share many nonobvious properties and such generalizations reduce the costs of learning. In ethnies, I will argue, inductive generalizations yield similar benefits.</p>
         <sec id="sc7.1">
            <title>Inductive Inferences In Species</title>
            <p>Let us assume that shared appearances are typical of members of a species but not determinative of membership (e.g., African wild dogs, coyotes, foxes, and wolves are not dogs). Let us further assume that what <italic>is</italic> determinative of membership is the essence, whatever it is. Finally, let us assume that essences are cognized as hidden, more than meets the eye, and therefore causative of a great many hidden properties and characteristics that are common to all category members but not immediately apparent (e.g., coyotes are wily). It seems reasonable, then, that (1) knowledge that an item is a member of natural kind A will lead to the automatic assumption that it has an A essence; (2) learning that this item has <italic>hidden</italic> property P should lead to the assumption that P is either caused by or a part of the essence and thus to the generalization that P is true of other A's; and (3) As that do not look like the target item will be thought of as having property P anyway, and nonA's bearing a strong similarity to the target will nevertheless be thought of as lacking P (unless the property is also specified for their natural kind as well).</p>
            <p>Studies involving 4 and 3yearolds (Gelman and Markman 1986 and 1987, respectively) have confirmed these propositions and Gelman and Markmans explicit hypothesis that natural kinds will favor categorical rather than appearancebased inductive inferences. For example, children did not make inductive inferences from a target cat with a white stripe down its back to a skunk even though they looked almost identical, but they did generalize to another cat that looked quite different from the target.</p>
            <p>Why do natural kinds promote inductive generalizations of nonobvious properties? Gelman and Markman (1986:18485) observe that naturalkind categories have rich, correlated structures and that many of the properties that correlate strongly are nonobvious at first and therefore extend far beyond our original categorization. For example, giraffes share a particular diet, life expectancy, gestation period, DNA structure, and so forthattributes that are impossible to know by casual inspection.  The highly correlated structure of natural kinds suggests that new features learned about one category member will often be projected onto other category members as well. A Darwinian unpacking of this statement might go like this:13 Any animal that relies heavily on learning will benefit by reducing the costs of the learning process. If we can reliably learn about whole suites of objects merely by examining one of them, then evolution would have failed us if it had not provided mechanisms for doing so. Of course this argument applies to artifact categories (which are also characterized by rich, correlated structures) as much as to natural kinds. What makes induction in natural kinds special is that inductions are easily made for <italic>nonobvious</italic> (i.e., hidden) properties, and this is because members of natural kinds in fact do share many nonobvious properties.</p>
            <p>Now consider artifacts: If I showed you a ceramic pitcher and told you that it breaks easily (a hidden property), you would be wrong to infer that this is true of all pitchers, since they can be made of wood, stone, coconut shell, metal, and, in modern times, unbreakable plastic (cf. Gelman 1988). The things that members of an artifact category typically share are perceptually obvious: their parts and their interconnections are constrained to be similar because they must fulfill the same function; the hidden properties (such as the properties of the materials they are made of) can vary widely so long as the artifact itself fulfills the same function. Thus, if I show you that a ceramic pitcher breaks easily, you would generalize that to ceramic anythings (because ceramic is a substance), but you will not think of this as a pitcher property (for evidence, see Gelman and OReilly 1988:881).</p>
            <p>Recently, Atran et al. (1997) tested to see whether people made inductive generalizations for hidden or nonobvious properties (e.g., susceptibility to a disease, possession of a protein) equally at all levels of the biological taxonomic tree. They found that people have a strong preference for making such generalizations at the <italic>species</italic> level even though, as shown by Rosch et al. (1976), this is not the basic level (established on perceptual grounds) for biological taxonomies. Although a domaingeneral mechanism does indeed seem responsible for the ranksimilarity of the basic level in all sorts of taxonomical domains, the biological domain has the idiosyncrasy that <italic>nonobvious</italic> properties maximally cluster not at its basic level (the lifeform level, e.g., <sc>bird, fish</sc>) but at the species level. Our cognition thus apparently favors inductive generalizations in species because this is where it makes most sense, and the cognitive idiosyncrasy suggests that we indeed have a privileged biological domain of cognition. Atran et al.s finding that people socialized into two very widely divergent cultures show the same absolute privilege for the species level when making inductive inferences supports the hypothesis that the livingkinds or folkbiology module is a human universal.</p>

            <title>Inductive Generalizations in Ethnies</title>
            <p>Processing an ethnie as a species, with the attendant penchant for assuming that any hidden properties true of one member will be true of all, is adaptive because members of an ethnielike members of a speciesshare many important properties (norms) specific to the ethnie. This claim of norm clustering may be counterintuitive for anthropologists and sociologists, postBarth (1969), who have decided that ethnic groups and cultures are not coextensive, and therefore I elaborate.</p>
            <p>Barths (1969) views on the relationship between ethnicity and culture are widely accepted. He is often presented as debunking the idea that ethnic boundaries organize culture. Following his critique, anthropologists are now very skeptical that ascriptive boundaries closely correspond to culture boundaries (e.g., Fried 1975; Tooby and Cosmides 1992; Hirschfeld 1996:2122). Such interpretations of Barth are, however, dead wrong. What Barth debunked was the idea that ethnic boundaries organize the <italic>totality</italic> of culture in a holistic waythat is, that ethnic boundaries are closely coextensive with discontinuities in trait inventories arbitrarily compiled. But practically in the same breath he insisted that what ethnic boundaries do enclose is ethnic organization (Barth 1969:12) and that the cultural content most relevant to ethnic groups is (1) the diacritical features that signal membership and (2) basic value orientations: standards of morality and excellence by which performance is judged (p. 14). So long as we agree that standards of morality and performance are culture, Barth is not really subtracting all culture from ethnicity, as if ethnic ascriptions were truly arbitrary, but rather insisting on <italic>a</italic> kind of culture as most relevant to ethnicity: standards of performance and the diacritics that signal membership inside a performancenorm boundary. As Barth (1994:1718) himself has recently observed, this part of his argument is often ignored:</p>
            <p>
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>The issue of cultural content versus boundary, as it was formulated [by Barth (1969)], unintentionally served to mislead. Yes, it is a question of analyzing boundary processes, not of enumerating the sum of content, as in an oldfashioned trait list. But locating the bases of such boundary processes is not a question of pacing the limits of a group and observing its markers and the shedding of members  central and culturally valued institutions and activities in an ethnic group may be deeply involved in its boundary maintenance by setting internal processes of convergence into motion; and we need to pay special attention to the factors governing individuals commitments to the kind of personhood implied by specific ethnic identities (Haaland 1991:158).</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Coming back to our main thread, concepts of personhood, as such phenomena are realized through the observation of performative norms with interactional consequences, are <italic>nonobvious</italic>hardly things that are readily apparent on casual inspection of an ethnic actor. If Barth is right, then, fully socialized members of an ethnic outgroup (and even of the ingroup!) will have many strongly correlated hidden properties. These hidden properties are extremely important, for they determine how easy or difficult it will be to coordinate with another human being. Barth argues that this is precisely why ethnic groups form: they demarcate ways of being (a commonly held view [see Smith 1986:41; Deutsch 1953]). According to Barth, we must define ethnic groups in terms of the actors own ascriptions because these imply commitments to certain interactional norms: If they say they are A  they are willing to be treated and let their own behavior be interpreted and judged as As and not as Bs (Barth 1969:15). Coethnics therefore understand each other to be playing the same game.</p>
            <p>But why do norms cluster in intercorrelated clumps? Barth explains the maintenance of ethnic boundaries in terms of the punishments that accrue to those who fail to fulfill the normative expectations of their coethnics. Such punishments enforce ingroup conformity and maintain normative differences between ethnic groups, which differences in turnbecause actors assume they are signaled in ethnic diacritics and ascriptionsentail constraints on interethnic interaction (Barth 1969:1718). Although Barth says nothing about conformism resulting from coordination costs, this suffices for boundary maintenance and is probably originally responsible, without punishment, for the emergence of intercorrelated clustering of interactional norms.</p>
            <p>Norm conformism14 allows humans to maximize the number of potential interactants in their local community with whom to engage in mutually beneficial cooperative and coordinated endeavors. Much evidence from psychology (e.g., Miller and McFarland 1991; Kuran 1995; Asch 1956, 1963[1951]) suggests that we are indeed norm conformists. To drive on the left side of the road when in Britain because that is what the British do would be sound advice even if there were no bobbies to inflict polite scoldings, and the wisdom it contains is routinely repeated as common sense in the proverb When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Notice also that the proverb and example contain wisdom about what to do when one is an <italic>immigrant</italic>. In an ancestral environment composed of wise conformists, immigrants would absorb the norms of the host community, and this would prevent the blendingofnorms effect that immigrants would otherwise have on cultural variation (Henrich and Boyd 1998), ensuring in this way that at least some important interactional norms would regularly clump discontinuously across the human landscape. Thus, it seems plausible that after the emergence of the conformist adaptation, the ancestral environment became populated with more or less welldefined, discontinuous norm clumps. There are two reasons that thinking of such incipient ethnic groups as species is advantageous in these circumstances:</p>
            <p>1. Interactions with those socialized into different interactional patterns and expectations will not as often be felicitous, and the costs incurredin energy and time wastedwill concede the evolutionary advantage to any mutants who manage somehow to discriminate (I am indebted to Robert Boyd, personal communication, for this argument). A naive species theory of the ethnic world would represent egos norm group as one natural kind and other norm groups as different kinds with different natures, making the interactional choices favored by a necessary selfsimilarity bias rather clear.</p>
            <p>2. To the extent that outgroup members are not irrelevant, adaptation to a normclumped world presents the dual challenge of avoidance and prediction. It is certainly best to be able to predict as much as possible about outgroup members without having to obtain this knowledge through too much costly interaction with them. Since conformist behavior will ensure that members inside the same conformist sampling horizon (i.e., inside the same norm boundary) will show strong intercorrelations for many nonobvious behavioral patterns and expectations, inductive generalizations (from the one to the many) will usually be a good way of cheaply obtaining and using such valuable information.</p>
            <p>These adaptive considerations can now be articulated with a plausible story of how ethnic groups came to look like species. Even putting aside the costs of different rearing, adoption, and conjugal practices, which must loom large for parents, we must consider that in simple societies marrying off ones children begins a longterm alliance with affines. Parents were bound to learn through trial and error that coordination in longterm reciprocity was more difficult and costly with people outside the norm boundary. Incipient ethnic groups thereby become normatively endogamous in part because of parental enforcement. Next, because much of culture is acquired at a young age and is developmentally stable, expert practitioners of a groups normswhen groups are endogamouswould tend to be those born of two member parents, creating the illusion that their cultural mastery was biologically inherited. Finally, such incipient groups began labeling and conspicuously marking themselves with cultural phenotypes to improve the accuracy of the interactional discriminations (McElreath, Boyd, and Richerson 2001).</p>
            <p>Thus, it is plausible that such groups came to prime the livingkinds module, for these traits are all highly diagnostic of biological species. Because the priming of this module would have had the positive adaptive consequences reviewed above, there was no selection to discourage it. In Sperbers (1996) terms, species (and not ethnies) originally constituted the proper domain for the livingkinds module, but then ethnies also became part of its actual domain by satisfying the modules input conditions. Because this had adaptive consequences, ethnic groups are now part of the livingkind modules proper domaineven if they are not species or even races.</p>

         <title>Is the Ugly Duckling Hypothesis Robust?</title>
         <sec id="sc8.1">
            <title>The Ugly Duckling Compared with Other Proposals</title>
            <p>The Ugly Duckling hypothesis predicts that categories that <italic>look</italic> like a species (i.e., meet the brains input criteria of a species) will tend to be essentialized, especially when the perceptions of descentbased membership and categorybased endogamy, in particular, are strong. A corollary is that inductive generalizations of nonobvious propertieswhich essentialist intuitions motivatewill be more easily made in categories that look like species.</p>
            <p>An alternative hypothesis posits a smooth entitativity continuum (Hamilton and Sherman 1996, Hamilton, Sherman, and Lickel 1998, Yzerbyt, Rocher, and Schadron 1997, Yzerbyt, Rogier, and Fiske 1998, Yzerbyt, Corneille, and Estrada 2001). The more a social group looks like the prototypical entitya human individualthe more it is essentialized, because we essentialize human individuals. The constituents of a humanits organs or cellsare all closely bunched together (proximity), they all die together if major organs cease to function (common fate), and they are divided into specialized, hierarchically organized functions in order jointly to contribute to the humans survival and reproduction (structure).15 The more a social category has these properties, this argument goes, the more we will essentialize it.</p>
            <p>My work in Bulgan Sum does not support this hypothesis. My respondents appeared to process clans and ethnies in different ways. Despite some similarities between clans and ethnic groups, entitativity seems much higher for clans. The Bangyakhan clan members all know and interact closely with each other, migrate together, and live in a relatively small territory (compare this with the Mongol territory of the Republic of Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, parts of southern Siberia, and Chinese Turkestan). Besides, these clans have some structure, for they are composed of different exogamous patrilineages and are closely coextensive with the smallest administrative unit, called a <italic>brigade</italic>. So these clans rank higher than ethnies in entitativity if one accepts the privileged variable of structure in the proposal by Hamilton, Sherman, and Lickel (1998). Despite all this, however, essentialist thinking seems absent at the level of the clan but quite evident for the ethnie. It seems more plausible that essentialized categories are perceived as entities than that meeting the objective criteria of entitativity causes essentialism. Thus, to ask, as Hamilton and Sherman (1996:348) do, When we think about the range of social groups that we encounter and perceive in everyday life, what is it that gives some of these groups more essence ? is not the same as asking what makes groups (objectively) entitative, as they believe. Many groups that we do not essentialize (e.g., firms) are much better examples of entities than is the average ethnic group. And races, which we do essentialize (Hirschfeld 1996), are vast collections of individuals with virtually nothing in common. It is hard to think of a category less like an entity than a socalled race.</p>
            <p>I argue that the ultimate cause for essentializing ethnies but not clans is that norms cluster at ethnic but not at clan boundaries, so selection has favored essentialism of ethnies. But in terms of <italic>proximate</italic> causes (priming inputs), what is it that makes ethnic groups good to essentialize? Perhaps in Bulgan Sum endogamy is one of the key differences. Even though the Bangyakhan are highly endogamous as a clan, this is not a rule but a preference expressed at the individual level, and parents never interfere when children wish to marry someone in another clan or, indeed, in another Mongol tribe. The rule, for most, is that their children may marry any Mongol they please, but they may not marry a Kazakh. It could be that the endogamy <italic>rule</italic>, as opposed to the pattern, is better at priming the livingkinds module, promoting essentialist thinking at those cleavages where one <italic>may not</italic>rather than typically does notoutmarry.</p>
            <p>The distinction between ultimate and proximate causes above is generally important and useful. Rothbart and Taylor (1992:21) argue that <italic>inalterability</italic> (the fact that membership is neither initially chosen nor changeable) and <italic>inductive potential</italic> (the idea that one member of the category is informative about all members) are what suggest a social category as an essentialized natural kind to human cognition. In species categories, I have argued, possession of the essence is necessary and sufficient to category membership, and the only way to acquire it is through biological descent. Thus, Rothbart and Taylors <italic>inalterability</italic> is, from this perspective, closely linked to reproduction and is primed by (1) descentderived membership and (2) categorybased endogamy. But <italic>inductive potential</italic> as such seems to play no promixate role in priming (i.e., activating) the livingkinds module. Otherwise, why the extreme, essentializing paranoia of the Nazis about untrustworthy aliens in their midst? The Weimar Jews were the product of several generations of acculturation to Germans. If inductive potential drives categorization, then it should have been difficult and counterintuitive to group the Weimar Jews as a naturalized category apart from Germans and imply that these were unknown aliens, because Weimar Jews were mostly very similar to Germans and for most purposes posed no risks of miscoordination. However, classing them as a nature apart proved regrettably easy for many. This is not an isolated case. Across the world, a medieval Chinese dynast likewise sought to eradicate an ethnic group that had become completely acculturated to and indistinguishable from the Chinese. In fact, many ethnic Chinese were killed in this genocide because the executioners could not always be sure and were ordered to kill when suspicious (Golden 1992). These and other examples suggest that inductive potential does not really drive categorization. Rather, social categories with normative endogamy and descentbased membership will be naturalized as having different, notfullyknowable essences, which assumption then motivates our inductive generalizations. What this means is that inductive potential is an <italic>ultimate</italic> cause (a selection pressure shaping our brains over the eons) rather than a <italic>proximate</italic> cause (an input stimulus that activates a schema in the brain) of socialcategory essentialism. Novel environments can undermine the original utility or function of a cognitive adaptation because, in the new setting, what primes the adaptation no longer correlates with the evolutionarily relevant variables. This seems to occur regularly in the case of state structures with institutionally absorbed and culturally assimilatedbut persistently endogamous and selfascriptivegroups. Such state structures did not occur in the socially uncomplexified ancestral environment, where a group outside ones endogamy boundary <italic>was</italic> almost certainly composed of strange foreigners. This explains the modern mistake of essentializing an acculturated group as different merely because it continues to marry within the group.</p>
            <p>Also absent in the ancestral environment were sharp racial differences between neighboring groups (these are the product of modern migrations [cf. Hirschfeld 1996:13; van den Berghe 1987(1981)]). Norm conformism in the ancestral environment would have led to a landscape peppered with the selfascriptive norm clusters that we now like to call ethnic groups. The fact of their norm differences explains why we essentialize them, but since neighbors were very similar in <italic>biological</italic> phenotype, why then are we apparently so prepared to essentialize races?</p>
            <p>As I have argued, members of different norm communities have resorted to marking themselves (with paint, dress, etc.) in order to broadcast membership. A recent model suggests that this adaptively improves efforts to identify members of ones norm community and avoidance of strangers with whom interaction is costly because of miscoordination (McElreath, Boyd, and Richerson 2001). It is plausible, then, that natural selection acted on our psychology so that we interpret sharp differences in <italic>cultural</italic> phenotypic markers as signaling different essences. It is also plausible that dramatic differences in skin color, hair type, etc.which would have been absent between neighbors in the ancestral environment but are common today because of modern migrations, colonialism, etc.are interpreted by our brains as ethnic diacritics. In other words, we essentialize races because we mistakenly think they are ethnic groups. We thus process races as ethnies even though not by the longest stretch of the imagination can they be characterized as representing norm or behavioral boundaries of any kind, which is the original reason for exapting the livingkinds module. (This point also undermines the idea that inductive potential promotes the naturalizing of a social category, for their is no inductive potential whatsoever to a racial category qua race.) Darwinians should recognize this as a bigmistake hypothesis for racialist thinking (the resulting pun is not really intended but entirely appropriate).</p>
            <p>Hirschfeld (1996) has demonstrated that biological phenotypic differences (i.e., racial differences) lead children to essentialize, and he acknowledges that this promotes inductive generalizations. However, he does not argue, as I do, that norms have anythingdirectly or indirectlyto do with it. On the contrary, he thinks that we have evolved machinery to essentialize human kinds even though, according to him, there is no clustering of cultural information that such essentialist inductions would help bootstrap (1996:2122). In this context it is difficult to see what purpose or function socialcategory essentialism serves. Why did it evolve?</p>
            <p>I think that the essentialized processing of such categories as castes and feudal classes is again due to the fact that the proximate priming inputs satisfy our evolved adaptations to distinguishing ethnic groups. Castes and feudal classes are occupationally specialized and outwardly marked, have many norms particular to them, and, most important, have descentbased membership and normative endogamy. Even if such groups did not exist in the simple societies of the ancestral environment, when they arose in modern times they primed our species moduleor the ethnicity module built on top of it.</p>

            <title>The Ugly Duckling CrossCulturally</title>
            <p>It is not yet possible to assess the crosscultural validity of the hypothesis because methodologies specific to investigating models of ethnic cognition have not been widely used. However, one can certainly evaluate existing data on their own terms. In a previous paper (GilWhite 1999) I examined the most important cases put forth to support the claim that an ethnic group is an instrumental association with chosen membership (which would deny all of the basic points argued here). These include the following ethnic transitions: Fur into Baggara in the Sudan (Haaland 1969), Pathan into Baluch in Swat, Pakistan (Barth 1969), and Kachin into Shan and other ethnic transitions in Burma (Leach 1977[1954]). For each of these, despite the (now famous) claims of their authors about people freely choosing to switch ethnies, the ethnographic data that they present show that no such transition takes place in the first generation (i.e., migrants from one ethnic community into another are considered until their deaths as members of the community of origin). The earliest any such transition can be completed is in the second generation, and this almost always requires a tie of blood through intermarriage. Other ethnographic cases of ethnicgroup membership switches tell the same basic story: Dinka into Nuer in the Sudan (Kelly 1985), Gungawa into Hausa in Nigeria (Salamone 1974:109, 117, 23637), Turkana into Samburu in Kenya (Hjort 1981), and Arabs into Malays in Malaysia (Nagata 1981).</p>
            <p>In the most thoroughgoing examination of such transitions, Levine (1987) documents in Nepal a great deal of instrumental accommodation by different groups of people to the caste and ethnic categories that best serve their interests in the sociopolitical environment in which they find themselves. But even in such a fluid place, Levine documents the following: (1) Many political manipulations and accommodations involve using labels that are only for outsiders or government officials; at the local level the ethnic distinctions remain intact, as do the patterns of normative endogamy that support them. (2) When genuine transitions from one ethnic category to another take place, these are typically not completed in political timescales but usually require several decades andmost importantintermarriage. Furthermore, changes in caste or ethnic status very often lag considerably behind the political/residential/economic accommodations. Thus, for example, Chetris may disapprove of marriages with lower castes and be pleased by caste fellows marriages with Thakuris, but there are recognized ways to integrate the offspring of intercaste unions. The rule given is that, after three generations of repeated intermarriages, the person is a full member of the caste group with whom the marriages occurred, whether lower or higher (Levine 1987:81).</p>
            <p>The crosscultural data are therefore apparently in harmony with the claim that normatively endogamous, selfascriptive groups with descentbased membership will promote the intuition that they possess a group nature or essence and that this essence cannot be acquired without ties of blood, perhaps not even without several generations of it. As one Kazakh informant put it to me, It takes seven generations for the [foreign] blood to be cleaned. The only case I have found in which ethnic switches occur without ties of blood is among the Kazakhs of Xinjiang, where the adoption of (often stolen) young children sufficed (Bessac 1965:37879). However, my own indepth work with Kazakhs from this general region reveals an intuitive cognition not inconsistent with the arguments presented here.</p>
            <p>One might object that this neglects the United Statesperhaps a major exception (at one time, after all, it even had an official melting pot ideology). I readily admit that ethnic affiliation, for many U.S. citizens, is less salient than a national identity as Americans, and this points to the salutary effects that a consistent ideology promoted at the state level can have on the production of cultural models that supersede in part our native intuitions. But the history of the United States is not inconsistent with the hypothesis presented here. The relevant factors are, here, (1) the rampant intermarriage among the European ethnic groups, (2) the failure to keep alive ethnic norms to a significant degree (see Alba 1990 for both points), and (3) the absence of a clear, uniparental descentrule for ethnic identity in cases of intermarriage (for the importance of this to the maintenance of boundaries, see Nave 2000). These three facts, in the light of the Ugly Duckling hypothesis, will be expected to produce just such a weakening of ethnic identity and a reformulation of a new ethnicity coincident with the new endogamy boundary (i.e., whites). Despite all this, the intuitionssuch as they arethat American whites have about their European ethnicity nevertheless rely on blood. Americans who say that they are half Irish, onequarter Italian, and onequarter Mexican are not explaining the degrees to which they have mastered these different cultures or choose to participate or affiliate with them but making a calculation based on the ethnicities of their grandparents.</p>

            <title>A Better Explanation for Ethnic Conflict?</title>
            <p>The most prominent psychological perspective on intergroup conflict has been social identity theory, which began by finding that people will discriminate against any outgroup, however defined (even if it is those who flipped heads versus those who flipped tails [Tajfel 1970, Diehl 1990]). This has been interpreted as a general answer for the root of ethnic hatred and other forms of conflict. However, even supposing that this demonstrates a general tendency to discriminate against outgroups rather than an idiosyncrasy of the experimental setup (see Mummendey et al. 1992), it still leaves us with the question: why ethnic hatred and warfare but, for example, no architect/lawyer riots? Why dont students from different universities attack each other with rocks and assault weapons and protest interuniversity marriages? Clearly, social categories are not all the same, and a purported bias against any and all outgroups cannot, by its very generality, explain why conflict should be so different across different kinds of group boundaries.</p>
            <p>The Ugly Duckling hypothesis can be the basis of a better explanation for why ethnic groups are unique. Let us provisionally accept that (1) ethnies are interactionalnorm groups, (2) people essentialize ethnies, and (3) ethnic membership is neither chosen nor alterable without subterfuge (lying about origins) because of ideologies that membership is a matter of descent. Now let us suppose further that people, <italic>inside</italic> their own group, are good at learning whom to trust. For example, I know that people inside my group who break ingroup norms (break promises and contracts, are not shamed by the right things, etc.) are bad and should be avoided because interactions with them are costly. Now turn to the outgroup: Members of the outgroup are always violating my ingroups norms. From my perspective, their behavior is wrong, and therefore they are bad people because I will judge them with the same mechanism that judges norm breakers in the ingroup. Being tolerantly cosmopolitan rather than ethnocentric confers no advantage on me because the costs of miscoordination with outgroup ethnics are very similar to the costs of being cheated by coethnics who should know betterin either case attempted reciprocal interaction fails. Thus natural selection has favored my interpreting the fact that they break my norms as a moral lapse rather than a cultural difference. This means that my baseline attitude towards outgroup ethnics, in the best of times, is one of at least mild distrust. Since I essentialize them, I think that their moral lapses result from their corrupt nature, which cannot be helped. This stance is likely to make me slide in the direction of misunderstanding and hatred when the time comes to interpret the motivations of outgroup members with whom I am in conflict. These mechanisms allow ethnic conflict to descend quickly into murderous hate, and the naturalization of the conflict can make it very stable.</p>
            <p>This account can also explain why the contact hypothesis has failed. This hypothesis states that contact between members of different racial, ethnic, or cultural groups fosters positive intergroup attitudes. However, empirical tests have found that contact achieves this end only when a long laundry list of joint conditions are met: the contact must involve cooperative activities; the participants must have equal status; they must also be similar on nonstatus dimensions; they must hold no negative views of each other at the outset; the outcome of the interaction must be positive; and so on (Miller and Prentice 1999:219; see Stephan 1985). In other words, experimental manipulations that meet all the above conditions improve intergroup attitudes<italic>contact</italic> doesnt. From the perspective of the Ugly Duckling hypothesis, this is not surprising. Contact, after all, reminds us that outgroup members have the wrong norms and do the wrong things.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The evidence from Mongolia supports the hypothesis that humans process ethnies as natural living kinds (theoretical considerations suggest that they do so at the species level). My Torguud subjects have a bloodbased model for assigning individuals to ethnies. Beyond this, they consider such assignment to carry implications for ethnic categorybased behavior even without any exposure to other members of their ethnic category, and they seem to believe that the ineffable something responsible for this is carried somehow inside. All of these parallel essentialist thinking in natural living kinds, suggesting that my subjects thinking about ethnies is not only primordialist but essentialist and that there is no difference between an ethnic group and a species from the point of view of the schemas that are primed to process them. Processing endogamous norm groups as species, I have argued, was adaptive in the ancestral environment because (1) it allowed us to learn a lot about outgroups in a very inexpensive way, in particular by making inductive inferences about nonobvious properties, and (2) it made possible processes of discrimination that prevented us from incurring the costs of coordination failure. The reason these benefits have been obtained specifically by processing these groups as species results from the fact that ethnies exhibit the most diagnostic features of species: groupbased endogamy and descentbased membership. This made it easy for a blind evolutionary process to exapt a preexisting architecture by simply failing to discourage the priming by ethnies of the livingkinds module. This is not, I think, how we think of social categories in general but only how we think of those categories which, as in ethnies, exhibit the strongly diagnostic features of biological species, such as feudal classes and castes.</p>
