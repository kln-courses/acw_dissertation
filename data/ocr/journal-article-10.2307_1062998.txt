<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edmund T. Gilday DANCING WITH SPIRIT(S): ANOTHER VIEW OF THE OTHER WORLD IN JAPAN The observations and reflections in this essay represent one part of a larger ongoing project in the study of Japanese festivals (matsuri).1 This larger project is concerned with the ways ritual might inform our understandings of the religious worlds and worldviews ("cosmolo- gies") of different sectors of Japanese society over time. Here, I hope to demonstrate one way in which the study of popular ritual activities can lead us in directions that conventional treatments of Japanese reli- gion often overlook or ignore. For example, most Japan specialists will readily admit that conven- tional terms like "Shintoism" and "Buddhism" are ultimately heuristic categories referring, usually in unspecified ways, to "typical" forms of cultic beliefs and practices. When pressed to specify even provisional criteria for distinguishing these forms, however, students of Japanese religion often unwittingly expose questionable premises derived from traditional Western models of what religion is and what role it plays in everyday life.2 Surprisingly, despite the fact that theoretical, historical, and practical problems with such descriptive categories are increasingly well documented, their uncritical use continues largely unabated.3 1 See Edmund Gilday, "Power Plays: An Introduction to Japanese Festivals," Journal of Ritual Studies 4, no. 2 (Summer 1990): 263-95. 2 For a detailed discussion of these premises and their role in the history of the study of Japanese religion, see Edmund Gilday, "The Pattern of Matsuri: Cosmic Schemes and Ritual Illusion in Japanese Festivals" (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1987), pp. 30- 64 passim. 3 The first systematic treatment in English of the historical problem was Kuroda Toshio, "Shinto in the History of Japanese Religion," trans.

The circularity of the first prediction is obvious, even if its implications are not. For one thing, it relies on a definition of re- ligion inextricably linked to quasi-ecclesiastical institutions whose his- torical associations with discrete sectarian interests are not always as continuous or as exclusive as the categorical terms "Shinto" and "Bud- dhist" might suggest. Furthermore, it begs the question of whether co- incidence, convenience, or historical vicissitude alone might link the festival activities to one or another venue.4 Finally, it goes without saying that institutional association is of no help at all in cases where festival activities take place outside the precincts of permanent cultic centers, or when the community itself (or its representatives) rather than a professional priest is in charge of the affair.5 The first section of this essay is an attempt to approach the problem of ritual space from a perspective that might avoid some of these pitfalls. The second rationale for identifying certain rites with Shinto rather than with Buddhism is expressly theological, being based on the nature and functions of the spirits being addressed in the rites.6 While this ap- proach has the advantage of drawing on evidence internal to the rites themselves rather than their physical environment alone, it too lacks historical reliability in many cases. Still, it has become conventional, for example, to associate local tutelary and agricultural deities (kami) Journal of Japanese Studies 7, no. 1 (Winter 1981): 1-21. See also the special issue of History of Religions 27, no. 3 (1988), entitled "Shint6 as Religion and as Ideology: Per- spectives from the History of Religions." James H. Foard, James C. Dobbins, and Robert E. Morrell have all written critical essays from the perspective of Buddhist studies in re- cent years, providing new insights into Kamakura-period religion in particular. Regard- ing the practical problems involved in moving away from the use of these categories, see Stewart Guthrie, A Japanese New Religion (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies, 1988), and my review of it in Journal of Religion 69, no. 3 (1989): 453-55. 4 An example would be the Ta-asobi rites of spring. See below, n. 45, for details. 5 The latter case is generally identified as "folk religion," a term with its own history and ambiguous connotations in the comparative study of religion. On the evolution of the concept "religion" in nineteenth-century Japan, see Helen Hardacre, "The Shinto Priesthood in Early Meiji Japan: Preliminary Inquiries," History of Religions 27, no. 3 (1988): 294-320. 6 I realize that this formulation is problematic, particularly in light of normative un- derstandings of Buddhist metaphysics. But that is the point: there is a disjunction be- tween normative formulations of "Buddhism" and "Shinto" on the one hand and the ways that people actually practice religion in Japan on the other. 274</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions with Shinto, while spirits (tama) of the dead have come to be associ- ated with Buddhism.7 This convention has at times been challenged, most notably by Yanagita Kunio, the founder of modern folklore studies (minzokugaku) in Japan, who argued for the identity of agricultural deities and ances- tors.8 In his concern to recover an "essential" Japan, Yanagita self- consciously dissociated himself from both Shinto and Buddhist sectarian research, which tended (like religious studies in the West) to dismiss or ignore popular beliefs and practices. He contended that the real soul of Japan was to be found in the unauthorized beliefs and practices of the ordinary villager (jomin) and was expressed not in abstract doctrines or literary texts but in the rituals of everyday life. Yanagita's rigorous commitment to a thesis of cultural relativity ech- oed a similar concern in certain Western anthropological circles, but it came about as a reaction against the imposition of external (both Asian and Western) criteria for understanding and evaluating Japanese cul- ture, not as the result of theoretical questions about the comparability of cultural systems.9 As I will argue below, however, even those who, like Yanagita, have tried to circumvent Western paradigms have them- selves sometimes gone astray in their classification of Japanese spirits as an ironic consequence of the priority they have assigned to the prob- lem of theology, which arguably is the perspective that most typifies the study of religion in the West. In this essay, I would like to propose what might be called a cosmo- logical (as opposed to a theological or anthropological) approach to popular Japanese festivals.10 I have framed my argument in terms of 7 The historical background for these associations is too complicated to pursue here. Helpful overviews can be found in Araki Michio, "Kokka no shuky6 to h6ku no shuky6 no rekishiteki s6go kanrensei," in Nihon shtkyo jiten, ed. Ono Yasuhiro et al. (Tokyo: Kobundo, 1985), pp. 605-12; and Miyata Noboru, "Kami kannen," in ibid., pp. 612-23. 8 Such a claim may seem quite ordinary to readers of James Frazer or Mircea Eliade, but the phenomenon is not nearly so evident in the case of Japan, as I will try to show be- low. See Yanagita Kunio's two classic studies, Nihon no matsuri (1942), in Teihon Yanagita Kunio shu, vol. 10 (Tokyo: Chikuma Shobo, 1969), and Senzo no hanashi (1946), translated by Fanny Hagin Meyer and Ishiwara Yasuyo as About Our Ancestors (Tokyo: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the Ministry of Education, 1970). 9 His critique of cultural hegemony extended at least implicitly to domestic centers of power as well.

Finally, the argument will return to the larger issue of methodology (Part III), where I will present evidence of how reliance on conventional models and categories has led to fundamental miscon- ceptions about traditional Japanese worlds of meaning. My aim is to demonstrate that the study of ritual can evoke models and categories that do not rely on cultural assumptions, such as those implicit in terms like "Shintoism" and "Buddhism," that lead to flawed interpretations of Japanese religious phenomena. I. THE HORIZONS OF A COSMOLOGY A. THE OTHER WORLD Let me begin with a few preliminary observations about the religious notion of the other world, a nebulous spatial image that, in the case of Japan, has been used to refer to both the realm of kami ("gods"-but see below) and the realm of the dead. This other world is variously placed-across the sea, in the woods or hills or mountains-but in any case beyond the normal purview of civilized humanity. It is from the other world that fertility is introduced in the spring, and it is against the chaotic forces of this other world that various seasonal rites are in- voked. It is, then, the prototypical locus of unrefined power according to the horizontal worldview of traditional Japan.12 The other world that I am referring to is the locus and source of extraordinary, unpredict- able power, both constructive and destructive, and it is the regulation of intercourse with this other world that lies at the heart of all popular festivals. It is also to the other world that the spirits of the dead are tradition- ally consigned. The relationship between these spirits and those con- nected with agriculture will become clearer as we proceed. But first we should understand in more concrete terms the general relationship be- tween the world of the human community and the other world of kami. 1 l See Allan G. Grapard's ideological analysis of other-worldly themes in "Visions of Excess and Excesses of Vision: Women and Transgression in Japanese Myth," Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 18, no. 1 (1991): 3-22. 12 Royall Tyler offers a sophisticated discussion of some of the philosophical issues that are raised by attention to Japanese cosmology in his "A Critique of Absolute Phe- nomenalism," Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 9, no. 4 (1982): 261-83. 276</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions Let me, therefore, outline the sacred geography, or (in other words) the spatially articulated cosmology, of a traditional Japanese village.13 Settlements were generally established in relatively flat areas near sources of water and wood. The religious geography was a plane, with hills considered progressively more peripheral to the domestic heart of the community the higher they were. Waters, too, were considered am- biguous, and in spite of proximity were always separated from the set- tled area itself, often acting as a natural boundary for the community. Yet the relative elevation of land was hardly the singular criterion for defining the perimeters of cultural space. Rather, it was in the first in- stance forests, spaces unclaimed for agriculture or settlement, that as- sumed at once a bounteous and a sinister character in the minds of the early Japanese. According to one legend about the origins of woods in Japan, "When Iso-takeru-no-kami descended from heaven, he took down with him the seeds of trees in great quantity. However, he did not plant them in the land of Han [Korea] but brought them all back again, and finally sowed them every one throughout the Great Eight-island-country [Japan], be- ginning with Tsukushi. Thus green mountains were produced."14 Likewise, in another version of this etiological myth, "Susano-o-no- mikoto [a divine culture hero, father of Iso-takeru-no-kami] said, 'In the region of the Land of Han there is gold and silver. It will not be well if the country ruled by my son should not possess floating riches.'" He then proceeded to pluck hair from his head and body and scatter it, thereby producing forests of trees, including the sacred cryp- tomeria and camphorwood, to be used as Japan's "floating riches."15 Regardless of the obvious geopolitical implications of both variants, what is important is their common recognition of wood as the divinely inspired medium of wealth and status for a nation whose resources were even in the eighth century recognized as radically different from if not 13 See the daring monograph by Paul Wheatley and Thomas See, From Court to Cap- ital: A Tentative Interpretation of the Origins of the Japanese Urban Tradition (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), for an interpretation of sacred geography in the imperial context.

My argument is based on inland agricultural communities, but the same con- clusions should apply, mutatis mutandis, to coastal villages as well. 14 Nihongi 1.58.

Trees have from the earliest times been a rich symbol of the participation of kami in Japanese civilization. While forested hills and mountains (yama) are frequently character- ized as the topographic sign of this multivalent presence, in the Ise region woods that do not follow hilly contours are also called yama, and those who perform matsuri there are villagers, not people whose occupations, such as lumbering or hunting, require them to enter the wilderness.16 In other words, the kami enshrined in such sanctuaries is construed to be a guardian deity of the village, not the proprietary kami of a wilderness area. The significance of this fact will become apparent below. The main point to note here is that woods in any topographic setting have a perva- sive aura of otherness, of the mystery and power of kami. This aura of multivalent otherness, of kami, in wooded areas is re- flected in the indigenous connotation of the term "shrine." The Chinese characters used to designate a shrine are in the eighty-century Man- yoshu consistently accompanied by the interlinear gloss for "woods" or "forest" (mori), and these are further distinguished from wooded areas not associated with kami.17 Citing not only classical texts like Fudoki and the Manyoshu but also modern field notes, Wakamori Taro argues convincingly that all locations where kami was perceived were desig- nated mori, while those places that were actually forested were iden- tified with a character borrowed from China that carried the imported meaning of a sacred grove of the tutelary deity of an area.18 To sub- stantiate his claim for the generic sense of mori as the locus of kami, Wakamori points out that in many areas in modern Japan the place at the foot of a hill where spirits of the dead are said to gather is called mori no yama, reduplicating the evocation of otherness associated with such sites. In Nara Prefecture, moreover, grave sites attached to resi- dences are also called mori, presumably for the same reason. This link- age of some ambiguous sense of otherness (kami) with a specific, identifiable anthropomorphic presence (the spirits of the dead) reveals additional information about the community's understanding of the other world. At the very least, the other world now exhibits signs of comprehensibility, for here we find not only some ambiguous aura, but the spirits of relatives and neighbors. These sites are the abode of forces that the community recognizes, and that in turn are familiar with the community. We will pursue this point in Part II, where the active relationship between the two worlds will be explored in more detail. 16 Sakurai Katsunosuke, "Ky6kai no Shinboku," in Kami to mori, ed.

As is well known, the uni- versal (that is, pan-Japanese) sign for the entrance to a shrine is the free-standing torii gate. These are frequently set at great distances from structures commonly thought of as the shrine itself, and in such cases numerous torii are placed at successively closer range to the principal sanctuary, forming a kind of tunnel of foliage and gates into the kami domain. This shows that "shrine" refers not simply to the buildings within the precincts but to the entire area within which the buildings are located. In fact, the grounds of the Grand Shrines of Ise, famous for their many natural sanctuaries, are exemplary as sites where the woods in which kami reside are themselves the occasion of matsuri, and as such are "the original form of Japanese shrines."19 Kawasoe Noboru reminds us that shrine buildings (shaden) were a creation of the ritsuryo era (seventh to tenth centuries) in response to Chinese architectural innovations.20 Others too have associated the evolution of shrine architectural features with the rise of Chinese, and in particular Buddhist, cosmological and aesthetic considerations.21 Still, though it is apparent on certain levels that continental influences had their effects on architectural as well as iconographic forms in Ja- pan, Christine Guth Kanda offers a salutary reminder that in spite of appearances the native cult that so favored wood and its mysterious properties never succumbed to what has often been characterized as the sinicization of Japanese religion, purportedly as early as the sixth century.22 And, while Kanda shows how the fusion of indigenous and Buddhist elements in Japanese iconography through the sixteenth cen- tury provides mute but eloquent testimony to the persistence of native beliefs, Kawasoe goes even further in the case of shrine architecture, claiming that "even as late as the Meiji period, it appears that most 'shrines' had no sanctuary buildings [shaden], and even those that did had very simple ones at that. The woods itself was the shrine; it was clear to all that by virtue of the presence of a torii gate alone the woods was itself a shrine."23 We see, then, that well into the modern era 19 Kawasoe Noboru, "'Mori' to 'Mori'," in Tokugawa and Sakurai, eds., p. 88. By "natural sanctuaries" I mean those without permanent structures to enshrine the kami. See below, Pt. IB, for further details. 20 It might be noted that a further product of the process of the changes attendant on increased urbanization and the ascendancy of Buddhist institutional forms was the sub- stitution of a worship hall (haiden) in place of simpler shrine structures (shaden). 21 See the classic English study by Robert Treat Paine and Alexander Soper, Japanese Art and Architecture, vol. z8 of The Pelican History of Art, ed. Nicholas Pevsner (Har- mondsworth: Penguin, 1960). 22 Christine Guth Kanda, Shinzo: Hachiman Imagery and Its Development (Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985). 23 Kawasoe, p. 90. 279</page><page sequence="8">Dancing with Spirit(s) permanent artificial structures delimiting and restricting sacred space were not widespread. No particular sectarian interests were associated with these sites-they were neither "Shinto" nor "Buddhist." Indeed, except for major shrine complexes affiliated with powerful clans or sponsored by the state, the vast majority of "shrines" throughout the country were wooded areas on the outskirts of villages, and these were identified with a general aura of otherness that coalesced at a specific (and temporary) ritual site only at festival times. Still, both mori and a more conventional term (yashiro) still in use to- day to designate a shrine can refer to particular spaces set aside by sanc- tions and restricted to the provenance of kami.24 In other words, the term shrine can refer not only to an ambiguous sacred area identified with kami, but also and more specifically to a culturally inscribed "sanc- tuary." It is not surprising that, as the boundaries of community life have expanded, so the perimeters of sacred space have become more pre- cisely inscribed as sanctuaries. Already in the ancient period, these sa- cred spaces were clearly demarcated, either as articulate zones within domestic space or as indeterminate regions outside the fixed perimeter of a communal settlement. In the first instance we see a level of discrete representation quite different from that of the second, but in both there is the recognition of a multivalent immanent presence that, as we will see below, is defined and controlled through communal ritual activity.25 B. BOUNDARIES The notions of otherness described above and the attendant ambiva- lence on the part of the human community are reflected in the bound- aries that festivals (matsuri) inscribe and sustain. However, the relationship between the realm of kami and that of the human commu- nity along these boundaries is not necessarily as tranquil as the discus- sion so far may have led the reader to believe. The tension that actually characterizes the relationship is well illustrated by an ancient legend, which provides a vivid example of what I mean by the "cosmographic" activity of matsuri, that is, the ritual inscription of an orderly world. The Hitachi Fudoki tells the story of a man named Matachi, who de- cided to clear some wilderness on the outskirts of his village in order to open new rice paddies.26 It so happened that in that undeveloped 24 Ishida Ichiro, "'Kami' to 'Mori'," in Tokugawa and Sakurai, eds., pp. 35-39. 25 I have outlined a more thorough preliminary argument concerning the cosmological variations reflected in different articulations of sacred space in Japan in my "Power Plays" (n. 1 above), pp. 280-86. The significance of these variations is not germane to my argument here. 26 Fudoki are provincial gazeteers compiled in response to an imperial edict of 713. Most are now very fragmentary or lost completely; the only one to have survived intact and in its original form is that of the Izumo district, translated by Michiko Yamaguchi 280</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions area there lived Yato-no-kami, terrible snakelike serpents with horns.27 Hearing of Matachi's plan, they conspired to prevent such an invasion of their territory. Matachi, of course, was outraged when progress on the construction kept being obstructed, so he donned his armor and at- tacked the obdurate serpents. Slaying some, he drove the others back clear to the surrounding hills. There he dug a ditch at the foot of the hills as a barrier and placed boundary stakes to mark the division, announcing, Above this line shall be the land of the kami; Below it shall be the rice-fields of humans. Henceforth I shall be the servant of the kami, and shall reverently minister [matsurau] to you forever. Earnestly (I pray)- You shall not curse us, nor shall you harbor ill will! He then erected a shrine, and for the first time performed services (matsuri) for the Yato-no-kami. Finally, he proceeded to clear more than 25 acres of land for his rice paddies. The legend notes that "to this day" Matachi's descendants have honored the pact and have continued to venerate these kami.28 The first thing we should note is a certain confidence on the part of the human community (in the persona of Matachi), a confidence in its ability to control the boundaries, and thus to control the intercourse, be- tween the two contending realms. Matachi's expedition of pacification signals the priority of human initiative and authority in the relationship between civilization and the raw forces of nature. Furthermore, if one aspect of this relationship involves domination (or pacification, as the Aoki, Izumo Fudoki (Tokyo: Sophia University, 1971). The extant text of the Hitachi Fudoki is abstracted from a larger work, and is available in two English versions: K6no Shoz6, comp., "The Hitachi-Fudoki or Records of Customs and Land of Hitachi," trans. Sakai Atsuharu, Cultural Nippon 8, no. 2-4 (1940): 145-86, which includes the original and romanized texts as well; and "Hitachi Fudoki," Traditions 2 (1977): 23-47, 55-78. For the Japanese texts of these gazeteers, see Akimoto Kichiro, ed., Fudoki, Nihon K6ten Bungaku Taikei 2 (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1958). 27 Much has been written about the multivalent characteristics of serpent deities and their association with mountain and water gods of folk mythology. For a very suggestive review of the problems associated with the issue of ambivalent kami, see Cornelius Ou- wehand, "Some Notes on the God Susa-no-o," Monumenta Nipponica 14, no. 3 (Octo- ber, 1958); 14, no. 4 (January 1959), pp. 138-61. For another, less systematic but nonetheless instructive view, see Neil McMullin, "On Placating the Gods and Pacifying the Populace: The Case of the Gion Gory6 Cult," History of Religions 27, no. 3 (Febru- ary 1988): 270-93. 28 Hitachi Fudoki, 8.10-11.

It is both creative and entertaining, both very serious and very playful. On the one hand, then, we see the dramatic spectacle of battle, creating order out of dis- order by reasserting distinctions, redrawing boundaries. Conversely, there is the promise of civilized exchange-matsuri-in the wake of pacification. In fact, the spectacle of battle that dominates the Matachi story is itself often reproduced in festive entertainment, and it is this double activity-of pacification and recreation-that constitutes the es- sence of matsuri display. The story has still more to say, for a new boundary is established on the far side of the fields, and there Matachi erects a shrine. It is there that the inaugural rituals sealing the covenant are performed, and there that the treaty is commemorated "to this day." Whereas the ditch and boundary stakes mark the division as a formal boundary, denying kami access to the occupied territory and ending the fractious intercourse between the two realms, the shrine itself serves to negate this radical disjunction, instituting a mode of intercourse-matsuri-initiated and controlled by the human community. The shrine thus marks the bound- ary as a cultural artifact, and constitutes a sanctuary where the bound- ary between this world and the other can be ritually dissolved. In other words, during festival times the boundary at this specific location is permeable, and here humans and kami can ritually coexist. But that is still not the whole story. For between this outer ritual boundary and the domestic space of the community lies another ambig- uous zone, a seam of arable land that will require sustained periods of intercourse between nature and culture, between the kami and human realms, in order to maintain the community. This serves to remind us that certain workplaces, like festival spaces, are located in the bound- ary zones circumscribing the traditional community. Indeed, agricul- ture and fishing both take place in the peripheral, ambiguous zone where nature and civilization intersect. Thus, both the economic and the ritual "center" of life is at the boundary, and it is along this bound- ary that the tension between this world and the other, between order and chaos, between life and death, is most apparent. The intercourse in this ambiguous zone is in fact an extended ver- sion of the rituals of the shrine (yashiro). The fields themselves might rightly be considered a larger articulation of the boundary shrine: a cir- cumscribed "natural" sanctuary within which kami will be bound at the beginning of a festival and from which it will be ceremoniously dis- patched at the end. The festival in this case involves the entire agricul- tural cycle, extending in the broadest sense from the spring, when the fields are plowed and flooded and finally planted with seedlings, to the 282</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions fall, when the crops are harvested and the fields are left for the winter.29 During the course of this cycle, many smaller rituals take place, implementing and reinforcing the larger process. In sum, then, this ritual process reflects a cosmology in which the primary relationship between the world of cultured order and the other world of untamed potential, of kami, is mediated along a permeable seam maintained and controlled by the human community. The imma- nence of the other world of kami, its contingent reality, is the premise of festival activities, and it is the regulation of relationships with kami that is their purpose. The apparent symmetry of this cosmological map is, of course, de- ceptive, for, while the human community can ritually inscribe a perfect world, the cultural ideal of stable, civilized life is illusory. In ritual, humans dominate and control the parameters of intercourse between the two contending realms. But in reality, the intrusion of disquieting change-epitomized as kami-is neither so easily anticipated nor so readily denied. The community knows this, and has therefore devised elaborate mechanisms to routinize its response to situations that threaten to upset the ideal equilibrium. As I will attempt to prove be- low through a detailed examination of two particularly dramatic sea- sonal expressions, popular festivals (matsuri) sustain the ideal of anthropocentric order by acknowledging change within a civilized structure.30 II. SUMMER RITES My examples consist of a number of forms of ritual entertainment that typify the variety as well as the consistency of the cosmographic op- eration associated with festival activities. In each example, there is a manifestation of kami in the persona of an "outsider," either physical or spiritual, who is introduced to the community, participates in the en- tertainment, and is finally dispatched. This manifestation and the ritual performances linked with it can occur at the boundaries of a village, or at a designated precinct within the village, or as part of a procession that passes through the village. The artificiality of ritual boundaries will here once again become explicit. 29 This process is analogous to events at grand shrines like Ise, where the sanctuaries are ritually maintained for twenty years, then the sites abandoned and the shrines moved to identical sanctuaries directly beside the original ones. The unused sites remain under sanctions, but no ritual activity or other maintenance occurs during the next twenty-year cycle. 30 Jonathan Z. Smith's argument in "The Bare Facts of Ritual," in Imagining Religion from Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1982), pp. 53-65, inspired my reflections on this, although clearly the conclusions I draw here are not the same as Smith's. 283</page><page sequence="12">Dancing with Spirit(s) In terms of the ritual operations themselves, we will see that, though the instantiated presence of kami is always a temporary apparition, the actual instrument of kami manifestation can be either temporarily or permanently identified with the kami presence. The size of the perfor- mance site can also vary dramatically, from a small platform to a large field to the entire village compound. Again, the means of introducing or manifesting kami visitors are diverse, but typically involve a combi- nation of sound (speech and music) and motion (dance and gestures). Finally, ritual recreation involves an appropriate feast, with special food, drink, songs, and games that symbolically mark the seasonal and social character of the proceedings. The types of festival I want to consider here are part of the larger cy- cle of rituals that begin with the introduction of kami from the hills into the rice fields, which have stood silent and barren through the win- ter. In the springtime transplanting festivals, the powerful presence of kami is admitted into the extended sanctuary zone at the edge of the village, and a new and dramatically closer relationship with kami is es- tablished. It is during the next phase of the annual cycle, the summer growing period, that the traditional ambivalence toward otherworldly forces is most clearly articulated in ritual activity. Let us now turn our attention to these summer rites. A. THE BUG FESTIVAL Not long after the fields have been planted the rainy season usually be- gins, nourishing the young shoots. But this same intense moisture also tends to augment the insect population. Within weeks, the fields are abuzz with the cacophony of disquieting nature.31 Conversely, if the rains do not come, drought can ensue, bringing its own pestilence and blight. Consequently, noxious elements that threaten the young rice plants as well as transmit diseases to humans are a major concern.32 The fields into which the community had gratefully admitted kami soon come to be in danger of being overrun by it. The ambivalent pres- ence of kami is as always a threat as well as a blessing, and steps must be taken to reestablish an orderly accommodation before the livelihood of the community is destroyed. Let us then consider what might conventionally be classified as a set of exorcistic rituals. I will draw on my fieldwork in Hiroshima Prefec- 31 See Alan L. Miller, "Ame No Miso-Ori Me (The Heavenly Weaving Maiden): The Cosmic Weaver in Early Shinto Myth and Ritual," History of Religions 24, no. 1 (1984): 29-31, where he discusses the acoustic signs of disorder associated with insects. It is more than curious that a very popular children's "pet" is a caged insect-which can be purchased from peddlers at festivals as well as at more conventional markets. 32 Or at least they were until the recent introduction of powerful (and to some sensi- bilities equally noxious) chemical insecticides. 284</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions ture for certain ethnographic details, but it should be stressed that the type of festival to be illustrated is common and still regarded as impor- tant in rural areas throughout Japan. The generic name for this kind of midsummer festival is mushi-okuri, or Dispatching the Bugs. Unlike the locus of the springtime rituals, the locus of this festival is not fixed on the periphery of communal space. The ceremony is char- acterized by a procession leading from the local tutelary shrine in the hills overlooking the village, through the town itself, and climaxing at the river, which forms one border of the traditional communal space. Along the route, various exorcistic rites are carried out in conjunction with dance performances, which will be considered in more detail be- low. If necessary, the ceremonies might be held a number of times in a single summer, depending on local needs. According to one report from the Tokugawa period, "after the midsummer of each year, all the households of the village gather for prayers to dispatch rice caterpil- lars. They place a straw figure of Sanemori on a horse and, carrying bells and drums and banners and singing old songs of celebration, they ceremoniously usher Sanemori from the head all the way to the tail [i.e., the exit] of the village."33 Hamlets along the river followed an es- tablished schedule for the rites, with those upstream traditionally be- ginning in early July and those progressively further downstream following in order. Formerly, each hamlet in the area performed the mushi-okuri; nowadays, the tradition in Hiroshima Prefecture is car- ried on most notably in Shinjo, where it is called the Hi-no-yama Odori or Nanjo-odori, in reference to the dances associated with the expulsion rites. This festival in Shinjo is a very vivid example of the ways in which matsuri incorporates change without altering its cosmographic struc- ture. Consider first the sequence of rites themselves. Neighboring ham- lets traditionally took turns assuming responsibility for constructing an effigy of the kami, personified as Sanemori; it was presented at the tu- telary shrine at Shinjo in mid-July (or in the middle of the sixth month according to the lunar calendar).34 Typically, after a preliminary service in the worship hall, Sanemori is brought out with a streamer attached that reads, "Away with insects; an abundance of grains and a plentiful harvest."35 The effigy is presented in 33 Oasa-sonsho shuccho, cited in Oasa-ch6shi hensan iin, ed., Oasa-ch6shi, 2 vols. (Oasa, Hiroshima-ken: Oasach6 ky6iku iinkai, 1978, 1982), 2:481. 34 The date has gradually been moved forward as a result of the introduction of im- proved seeds and fertilizer, so that in 1989, for example, it was held on June 23. The de- termining factor is the relative maturity of the plants; the rites must be held just before the ears of grain begin to open. 35 The full ritual performance described below was last carried out in 1979. Today the rite consists only of the ritual offering and petition (norito) within the worship hall. 285</page><page sequence="14">Dancing with Spirit(s) the courtyard in front of the shrine, and then the sounds of drums and flutes and hand cymbals (or bells) can be heard approaching the pre- cincts. The musicians enter the shrine courtyard, dressed in lightweight medieval military costume and singing to the accompaniment of their in- struments. There are fifteen or twenty performers in procession, led by huge banners and a "director" and followed by the musician-dancers. They form a circle around Sanemori and proceed to sing and dance in this circular pattern. The song types vary, but include songs of praise for the "garden" where they perform, short seasonally appropriate numbers analogous to those used in the spring transplanting festival, and specifi- cally exorcistic songs like the following: With the broad sword of Sanemori on our side, The rice bugs will surely be subdued.36 In addition, short narrative antiphonies are interspersed, especially in western Japan, but their stories frequently find parallels in other areas of the country in dances during the spirit festival of O-Bon. The significance of this will become apparent in a moment, but let us first follow the ritual process already begun. Immediately preceding the descent of the entire company toward the village, Sanemori is mounted on the straw horse.37 Proceeding in a file led by youth groups bearing towering banners and poles, followed by the mounted Sanemori, and brought up by the dancer-musicians, they stop first at the outer torii marking the boundary of the shrine pre- cincts, where the procession again forms a circle and the musicians perform another danced ritual. This pattern of procession and circular dance continues as the group moves through the village, with intermit- tent stops at rice fields where exorcistic rites are performed with the banners and decorated poles as purificatory "wands." Along the way, the performers are also afforded frequent rests at shops and farm- houses, where they are offered refreshments; the huge poles are simply propped against the eaves of nearby buildings during these breaks. Finally, the procession reaches the riverbank at the edge of town and a climactic dance with song is performed. Then the straw effigy is thrown into the water, to be swept away in the current. In earlier days in Shinjo, the banners and poles also used to be rinsed in the stream and then returned to the village, but the spectacle of such towering props disappeared after 1920, when the banners became entangled in 36 Cited in Nishitsunoi Masayoshi, Nenjui-gy6ji Jiten (Tokyo: Toky6d6, 1961), p. 582. 37 Today, the effigy is kept in storage from year to year and when it is displayed dur- ing the summer shrine rituals Sanemori is already mounted on the straw horse. 286</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions newly installed electrical wires along the road.38 In any case, after evicting the Sanemori effigy, the villagers return to the village to cele- brate the day's events with further recreation, including singing, danc- ing, and feasting. There are a number of extremely important elements here, each of which yields valuable insights into the history and meaning of the fes- tival. Let us begin with the figure of Sanemori himself. The legendary origins of the character can be found in the twelfth-century Heike Mo- nogatari, where an equestrian soldier of the Taira clan by the name of Saito Sanemori is reported to have been slain in battle after he was ig- nominiously tossed from his mount, which had stumbled while running through a flooded rice paddy. Tradition has it that Sanemori took the form of a rice bug to reek revenge for his untimely fate. He is thus a metonymic representation of agricultural calamity, to be pacified by dance and expelled to the outside or other world.39 An alternative explanation links Sanemori with other Sa-type kami, that is, kami whose names begin with the syllable Sa. These are char- acteristically associated with agriculture and communal protection. The most notable examples of this type are Sanbai (the kami of fertility introduced into the rice fields in the spring) and the generic Sae-no- kami, who are identified with boundary protection, particularly during the New Year season but also, by extension, at each seam (orime) in the spatiotemporal world of traditional Japan. This association allows us further to specify the connection between the antipestilence rites of these breaks with other recreational forms of seasonal festivals. Rites analogous to those of Sanemori, called Saba-oi (Saba expul- sion) in Yamaguchi Prefecture differ from those in Hiroshima in that the straw effigy, stuffed with offerings, is actually passed from village to village until it reaches the coast, where it is thrown into the sea. An even more interesting variation occurs in certain midsummer (nagoshi) ceremonies studied by Higo and others, where huge straw rings (chi no wa) identified with a fertility serpent are, at the end of the ceremony, cut into small pieces and thrown into the river.40 But their importance does not end there: villagers downstream in fishing com- munities at the mouth of the river collect these pieces of the fertility ring as talismans for a successful fishing harvest. Thus we have further 38 This according to Oasa-ch6shi, hensan iin, ed., 2:506. I have been unable to verify the date, but I strongly suspect that these "electric light poles" do not indicate rural elec- trification of the sort associated with the 1930s and 1940s in the United States. 39 Variations of the legend of Sanemori, "Lord of Rice Bugs," are told throughout Japan in connection with mushi-okuri rites. See Nishitsunoi, p. 343. 0 Alternatively, the effigies are taken into the river to be cut up and released. See Ouwehand (n. 27 above), p. 145. 287</page><page sequence="16">Dancing with Spirit(s) startling evidence of the deep ambivalence attached to the notion of kami, an ambivalence that marks the cosmographic project identified with matsuri in its many forms. Now, the dances associated with the mushi-okuri festival in Shinjo are called Nanjo-odori (Nanjo dances). The name for these dances de- rives from a tale dating back to the sixteenth century, when the armies of Kikkawa Motoharu were besieging the Ueishi Castle in Hoki, which was under the command of a man by the name of Nanjo Motosugu. Knowing of Nanj6's fondness for folk dance, Kikkawa disguised his soldiers as dancers and carried out a successful surprise attack from in- side the castle.41 At this point one might reasonably wonder how the Nanjo dance came to play such a central role in the Bug Festival. The coincidence of two apparently unrelated events-Sanemori's death and subsequent oath of revenge on the one hand, and Nanj6's defeat four centuries later-depends on two factors. First, there is a persistent feeling throughout Japan that noxious insects somehow incorporate the enmity of those who have died prematurely. In fact, as far back as the Nara period and the rise of Buddhist-inspired belief in unpacified spirits (goryo), antipestilence rites had come to be linked with pacification rites for spirits of aristocratic victims of war and political intrigue.42 It must be recalled that, in ancient Japan as elsewhere, pestilence afflict- ing humans and pestilence affecting crops were thought to originate from the same source. In the urban centers of Heijo (Nara) and later Heian (Kyoto), where epidemic outbreaks of disease were not uncom- mon, numerous rites both at the New Year (e.g., the Michiae) and in the spring and summer (e.g., the Hanashizume) were carried out to forestall the spread of noxious kami. Although evidence of widespread changes in popular conceptions of kami does not appear before the Tokugawa (seventeenth to nineteenth centuries) period, it does seem likely that the mediating role of local sha- manic specialists in rural areas was to some extent supplemented and in some areas even displaced by the Buddhist and Onmyodo practitioners who introduced continental notions of spirituality into the countryside. For example, nembutsu dancing, which will be discussed more fully be- low, spread rapidly as a technique not only for celebrating the salvific 41 This type of festive duplicity has ancient precedents in Japan and analogues throughout the world. For Japanese examples, see Kojiki 1.17, 19, and 11.51, 52; and Nihongi III. 16-19. 42 Hori Ichir6, Folk Religion in Japan: Continuity and Change (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968), p. 72. Neil McMullin and others have extended conventional theses concerning the relationship between the goryo cultus and the emerging "multiplex system" epitomized in Heian ecclesiastical syncretism (Shinbutsu shigo). See McMullin (n. 27 above), pp. 285-93. 288</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions power of the Buddha Amida, but also for pacifying the potentially un- ruly spirits of those dying of famine or the plague. There is evidence that nembutsu practitioners (hijiri) even advanced onto battlefields in order to comfort the dying and transport their spirits into Amida's paradise.43 Nevertheless, it was not until the Meiji period and the reassertion of an- cestral ideology that the link between ancestral spirits and agricultural and tutelary kami first came into widespread currency. That being said, I would contend that ancient indigenous practices of tamashizume or spirit pacification remained at the heart of all of these ceremonies. Buddhist insinuations may have refracted earlier attitudes by homologizing newly identified unpacified personalities with tradi- tional conceptions of destructive kami, but there is no doubt that the fundamental religiocultural paradox addressed by matsuri has contin- ued to be the ambivalent relationship of kami and community. This cosmological paradox has continued to be expressed in terms of pacifi- cation and recreation, regardless of the diverse ways in which either kami or community has been perceived or represented. The fact that the representation of indigenous conceptions of kami shifts at times from abstract or nonanthropomorphic forms to personalized and his- toricized forms does not change the basic terms of the cosmology. Still, historical allusion does contribute to our understanding of this cosmology. To return to the question of the relationship between the Bug Festival and the Nanjo dance, we can see that the drama of the Nanjo performance involves a ritual operation analogous to that of the histori- cal event. Just as Nanjo's forces were conquered by seductive subterfuge, so also are the kami forces of pestilence and disease (in Shinjo, under the command of the spirit of the warrior Sanemori) lured into submission by the dancers and musicians of the civilized community.44 It is not surpris- ing that to peasant farmers marauding soldiers resembled malevolent kami: both are unruly outside forces that threaten the very existence of the local community. What is surprising, perhaps, is the confidence of the community that Sanemori the bug lord will continue year after year to be as gullible as was Nanjo the warrior, and that they can disarm Sanemori with the same ritual trick that overcame Nanjo. There must be 43 See Hori, Folk Religion, 123 ff., esp. nn. 63 and 64. Note that here too the operative notion is to consign the spirits to the other world, however that realm may be articulated theologically. 44 One is reminded of Levi-Strauss's analysis of Fox adoption ceremonies, which too involve bitter or regretful souls of the deceased who are brought into the ritual game only to be duped. "Under the guise of playing with the dead, one plays them false and commits them" (Claude Levi-Strauss, The Savage Mind [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966], p. 32). In the Japanese case, however, it is not a contest with the dead, de- spite the legendary etiology. Rather, the contest is with deadly disorder, in the guise of kami that "seeth like the insects that defile or wither" (Miller [n. 31 above], p. 30). 289</page><page sequence="18">Dancing with Spirit(s) a reason for that confidence, and it may be found in the magical powers of the dance performances themselves. As we saw earlier, the Nanjo dance is in fact a variation of nembutsu- odori, a dance style characteristic of popular Buddhistic practices thought to have begun with the rise of goryo beliefs. It consists of two parts. The first, called the Street Dance, takes place as the procession moves through the village. The second is the Main Dance, which is a circular form that takes place at successive stopping points along the route in conjunction with other exorcistic rites. The Street Dance is more characteristic of the nembutsu-odori style, in which the partici- pants, carrying lanterns and torches and chanting to the accompaniment of hand cymbals and drums, proceed in an extended circumambulation of the village precincts (see below). This Street Dance is a regular feature of rites at critical junctures in the agricultural cycle that are designed to ensure a bountiful harvest. Ceremonies like the Flower Pacification (hana-shizume) and the Boundary and Wind Festivals in the Spring, and the Rain Ceremonies (ama-goi) and antipestilence rites (mushi-okuri) in the summer include such dances, as do the anticipatory ta-asobi ceremonies that are per- formed at the start of the agricultural year.45 On the other hand, since the early Heian period this style has been infused with a Buddhistic el- ement identified with the missionary efforts of the monks Kuya, Jakushin, and still later Ippen, who popularized its efficacy in connec- tion with nembutsu invocation, which as we have seen was deeply im- plicated in the spread of the goryo beliefs introduced earlier. In any event, the function of this processional style of dance is to transport kami visitors, as opposed to transfixing or enchanting them. The latter is a function of the Main Dance. In contrast with the processional Street Dance, then, the Main Dance of the Nanjo performances is characterized by its circumambulatory choreography, in which the performers form a large revolving circle (or concentric circles, when the group is very large) around a central object. In the case of the Shinjo mushi-okuri ceremonies, this object is the Sanemori effigy, but in other cases, such as the O-Bon dance to which our attention will be turned in a moment, it can be a house, or a 45 As a generic term ta-asobi refers to New Year (spring) rites pantomiming the pro- cess of rice cultivation, from spring planting to the harvest. In certain locales they are performed around the time of spring transplanting; the local names for these rites also vary. The function is of course to assure a good harvest. Some scholars have suggested that ta-asobi rites originated in the Buddhist Shush6-e, performed at major Buddhist monasteries since the Nara period. Although before the Meiji ta-asobi were routinely held on the grounds of local shrines identified with Buddhism, there does not appear to be any credible evidence linking ta-asobi to the powerful regional or national Buddhist institutions where the Shush6-e were held. 290</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions platform or tower set up in the middle of a large courtyard or public square, where the leader stands and sings the introductory phrases of the songs. The function of this style, in contrast with the processional form, seems to be much more closely related to appeasement and en- tertainment than to transportation of kami. Still, it involves the use of similar costuming and props, indicating the close association and sometimes sequential pattern of performance of the two styles. Decorative headgear, for example, is common to both styles of dance. In some cases, like the hanagasa-odori,46 branches of chrysan- themums or peonies are dangled from the straw hats of the dancers, who are dressed in bright kimonos and portray young geisha (from a story similar to that of Nanjo-odori). In O-Bon dances, tasseled or veiled hats or even peasant towels, draped over the head to disguise the dancer, are also common. Likewise, the pattern of music and songs that accompany both styles is homologous. Drums and hand cymbals keep the tempo and announce transitions, while the songs again take the form of antiphony. As for ritual props, they are of two kinds: those composed of uncul- tivated plants, such as trees, grasses, and wild flowers, and those that have been produced and processed for human consumption. Props of the first type often function as the media for kami manifestation and are returned to their proper environment outside the domestic space by one means or another at the end of the ceremony or of the appropriate season. Examples of this include the Sanemori effigy and the straw rings (chi-no-wa). The other major kind of prop is the "domesticated" offerings of rice and its by-products (such as sacred rice wine), as well as fruit, dried or cooked fish, and other foods. Unlike the uncultivated props, these are consumed within the community by the festival par- ticipants (including the kami) as part of the recreational activity of the festival. By the consumption of the offerings, which are the product of the covenantal relationship between kami and community, the renewal of this relationship is assured. That these offerings are both the product and the guarantee of the orderly nature of the relationship highlights its asymmetry: participation of the kami guests at these events is the result of human initiative, and is most dramatically articulated in the manner and material tokens of celebration. The offerings and the feast that they inevitably produce are emblems of the domesticated, and are them- selves consumed within the festival space, not returned to nature like those props that represent the kami realm. Even the offerings stuffed 46 The Flower-Hat Dance. It is held in Chiyoda-ch6, Hiroshima Prefecture, a town to the south of Oasa and Shinjo. Traditionally, the dance was performed on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, but now is part of the transplanting festival in late May. A more famous version (hanagasa ondo) is performed in Yamagata Prefecture. 291</page><page sequence="20">Dancing with Spirit(s) into the Saba effigy as it is passed from village to village on its way to the sea can be said quite literally to have been consumed by the kami before it was expelled. This entire paradigm finds its most concrete expression when kami is personified in human visitors who are admitted to the village at festival times and who often themselves contribute actively to the ritual enter- tainment.47 The characteristic dress of these itinerant visitors-straw rain hats and coats and woven sandals-has come to symbolize kami guests who must be placated and sent away again. Needless to say, the Bug Festival does not lend itself to easy classifi- cation in terms of Shinto or Buddhism. Even with ample evidence of the diffused impact of Buddhist soteriology and ritual performance styles, for some reason the mushi-okuri is generally regarded as an ex- ample of folk Shinto, presumably because of its intimate connection with agriculture and local communal life. If that is a legitimate crite- rion for classification, then my next example should also be called "folk Shinto," but it is not. Let us turn to that example and try to dis- cover why. B. THE SPIRIT FESTIVAL (O-BON) Perhaps the best known and, from certain points of view, most impor- tant midsummer festival is the O-Bon, a spirit festival that traditionally takes place during the seventh lunar month, or in August according to the solar calendar. A great deal has and could still be written about the origins and tradition of this festival from the perspective of Buddhist doctrinal or institutional history.48 What concerns us here, however, is how it has been incorporated into the larger cosmographic project of Japanese matsuri in spite of its apparently prescriptive concern with Buddhist soteriological interests. O-Bon can be seen as a typical form of festival whose recreational aspect illustrates how change can be ab- sorbed within the intensely conservative pattern already identified with matsuri. 47 These visitors were both cosmologically and socially quintessential outsiders until the Tokugawa period and even into the modern era. See Hori Ichiro, "Mysterious Visi- tors from the Harvest to the New Year," in Studies in Japanese Folklore, ed. Richard M. Dorson (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), 1963. 48 The most recent work in English on the Bon Festival, particularly in its Chinese context, is that of Stephen F. Teiser, The Ghost Festival in Medieval China (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988), and his "Ghosts and Ancestors in Medieval Chinese Religion: The Yu-lan-p'an Festival as Mortuary Ritual," History of Religions 26, no. 1 (1986): 47-67. His bibliography and notes include an admirable representation of Japa- nese scholarship on the subject. For an exhaustive introduction to theoretical approaches to ancestor worship in general and more particularly to the problem in the Japanese con- text, see Helen Hardacre, "Reiyukai Ky6dan and the Practice of Lay Buddhism," (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1980), esp. chap. 1 and its documentation. 292</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions Origuchi Shinobu and others have noted that rites for the dead were observed periodically throughout the year until about the fourteenth century, after which the times when spirits were thought to return to their ancestral homes were reduced to two, once at the New Year and once in the seventh month.49 These events coincide with major rites of purification (O-Harae) and transition and are accompanied by celebra- tory feasts and entertainment. To begin, let us see in general what hap- pens at the midsummer spirit festival today. Since the details of the festival performance differ by location, I will again use materials from my own fieldwork for a descriptive base, supplementing these observa- tions where appropriate with data from other areas and sources. In Hiroshima, the main festival is celebrated between the thirteenth and the sixteenth of August. This is preceded, of course, by a period of preparation, when wildflowers are gathered in the hills, the paths to the grave sites cleared, and the graves themselves washed and decorated.50 Fresh flowers, incense, water, and lanterns are readied at the grave sites for the evening of the thirteenth. Within recent memory, lanterns set atop towering poles were placed outside each house as beacons for the returning spirits, but today this custom, still common in many areas of Japan, is no longer practiced. Rather, after sunset on the thirteenth, the lanterns at the family grave sites are lit and incense burned to in- vite the spirits home. The color of these lanterns varies depending on whether a family has lost a member during the preceding year. If so, the lantern is white; otherwise, the lanterns are either red or blue/ green. There is one for each deceased member still remembered by someone in the household. The significance of these lanterns will be- come apparent as we proceed. In many parts of Japan where the community still retains responsi- bility for organizing the festival, a large fire (monbi) is set on a hill overlooking the village, and from this beacon fire individual house- holds light lanterns to escort their visitors home. In other cases, the en- tire village forms a torchlight procession, singing and dancing through the village to those homes that have lost a member during the previous year. There the procession circles the house, dancing and singing, then continues in similar fashion to the next house. In still other places, such as in southern Kyushu and in the Ryukyu Islands, a ritual tug-of- war takes place, in which the spirits are drawn back to the village by a 49 Origuchi Shinobu, Origuchi Shinobu zenshu, comp. Origuchi hakushi kinenkai, 32 vols. (Tokyo: Chui k6ronsha, 1955), 11:244 ff. 50 It should be recalled that graves in this area are located on the edge of the hills, on the far side of the rice paddies. Formerly, the path to the cremation site (yakiba), in a clearing some distance into the hills, was also ritually prepared. By 1980 cremation was routinely being handled commercially outside the village, but the original communal site, overgrown by vegetation, was still clearly identifiable. 293</page><page sequence="22">Dancing with Spirit(s) huge rope. Sometimes, particularly in Okinawa, these spirits are ex- plicitly identified with fertility. In other locales, in the Kanto region, for example, a rope replaces the lanterns for the procession into town, effectively mixing the two ritual vocabularies.51 All of these forms, of course, retain the structural pattern of introducing the spirits into the village by means of a communal display of eagerness, indicating that the privatized rituals in northern Hiroshima are relatively exceptional. The most common pattern of ritual introduction involves the same dance sequence we noticed in the mushi-okuri festival, but with the re- verse intention. Here, the spirits are being escorted into the community and their presence celebrated. In addition, the dancer-musicians are usually young people explicitly chosen for their youth, while the singers are elder members of the community. Nishitsunoi, for one, considers this a double initiation, first for the recently deceased spirits, which are not yet fully inducted into the ranks of "pure spirits" (shoryo) or ances- tors, and second for the young performers, who are not yet recognized as adults in the living community.52 I would go further and contend, from the point of view of the matsuri pattern exposed so far, that, since none of the returning spirits have been fully integrated into the ranks of the collective ancestors (as evidenced by their personal identification in the memory of the community), their reintroduction into the community is only tentatively encouraged, for they will be dispatched again at the end of the festival. They are a special order of "other," at once "insiders who are out" and "outsiders who are in."53 We could say, then, that they are admitted with the same ambivalence, or duplicity, that Levi-Strauss found among the Native North Americans. In Shinjo and environs, in fact, the returning spirits are not formally ushered back to the homestead, but are rather vaguely assumed to fol- low the family members back from the graves or, by some accounts, to 51 See Mabuchi Toichi, "Space and Time in Ryukyuan Cosmology," Asian Folklore Studies 39, no. 1 (1980): 1-19; and Nishitsunoi (n. 36 above), p. 746. Nishitsunoi further notes that the rope-pulling ritual is more common at the New Year Spirit Festivals in eastern Japan, while in the west they are generally found at O-Bon. 52 Nishitsunoi, p. 749. Kikkawa Shihei, who has done extensive research on O-Bon in Oita Prefecture and elsewhere, notes that active participation, particularly in the climac- tic Main Dance (see below) is correlated with both age and physical mobility. With age or infirmity one's place in the circle of dancers grows more distant from the axis. In other words, the less integrated one is into the social fabric of everyday life, the more periph- eral is one's place in the ritual performance. Kikkawa sees this phenomenon as parallel- ing the participatory role of the spirits of the dead. The significance of these observations in my argument will become apparent later. 53 I am intentionally not including here any discussion of the "orphan spirits" or "hungry ghosts" that are often mistakenly considered major participants in the Japanese O-Bon. Indeed, it would lend support to my argument if they were, but as far as I have been able to discover they are peripheral to the festival now. Still, their relationship to gory6 beliefs and their ritual appearance during this season warrants acknowledgment. 294</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions remain at the grave site itself. In either case, each day at least one member of the family returns to the graves to light incense, water the flowers, rinse off the gravestone (thereby "cooling the spirit"), and pray. In some parts of Japan, it is the custom to erect a temporary shrine outside the house as a shelter for the spirits during their visit. In other areas, this shrine is placed inside the home or, as with some families in Shinjo, the regular ancestral altar (butsudan) is perceived to serve the same purpose.54 During the three days of the festival, offerings are placed at these shrines, and family members, many of whom have had to return great distances for the event, offer prayers and make reports or requests to the visiting spirits. It is, needless to say, a very festive as well as somber so- cial occasion, but one that remains except for the first and last evening a relatively private affair shared only with relatives and close friends, who may call to exchange greetings and share in the celebration. In Shinjo, even this festive spirit appears to be a relatively recent phe- nomenon and remains traditionally restrained in many households. An official report of 1819 suggests the importance of the historical strength of Shinshu Buddhist practice in this regard: "The Urabon-e [O-Bon] runs from the eighth to the fifteenth, and consists of Buddhist services [hoza] day and night. Because the whole village is Shinshu, there are ab- solutely no Spirit Festival ceremonies, but only visits to the graves and to the temples. As for the Bon dances, they might do the hanagasa [Flower-Hat] dance or the like, depending on the health of the crops."55 The observations of the visiting official who wrote this report alert us to not one but two curious facts. First of all, the pervasive influence of Shin Buddhism, which denies the efficacy of prayers for the dead except as tokens of gratitude to Amida for having saved them, did not preclude the practice of visiting graves and otherwise remembering the dead. If cur- rent practice is any gauge, moreover, the spirits of the dead are believed to return at O-Bon, even by Shinshu priests, who themselves place lan- terns at their family grave sites at O-Bon. Second, the convergence of agricultural and ancestral rites presumed by the official in describing the dances is testimony to the extraordinary similarity between the two per- formance events (a fact of which we are already aware). Not surprisingly, the similarity is most striking at the conclusion of O-Bon, when the spirits are dispatched. On the evening of the sixteenth, 54 This uncertainty about the physical locus of the spirits did not disturb my infor- mants even when the issue was pushed during interviews. Inevitably, I was directed to speak with the local priests (both Shinto and Buddhist) when matters of "doctrine" or "logic" were involved. Students of Chinese religion will not be surprised by this appar- ent confusion. See, e.g., Steven Harrell, "The Concept of Soul in Chinese Folk Reli- gion," Journal of Asian Studies 38 (1979): 519-28. 55 Oasa-ch6shi hensan iin, ed.

In other words, what once was the logical climax of the festival, mirroring the introduction of the spirits, now is performed as the primary public display, disconnected from its place in the ritual process. Yet the semantic layer remains intact, for the revolving choreography, established earlier as a typical form of kami enchantment and exemplified in the Main Dance of the mushi- okuri, now is used to entertain the spirits of the dead before their depar- ture. Many of the songs that accompany the dance are laments, express- ing the community's regrets that the visit is drawing to a close. Narrative antiphonies recall tragedies of the past, such as the untimely deaths of villagers, as well as larger catastrophes such as earthquakes and the like. But other, happier songs and their accompanying gestures pantomime agricultural activities, once again signaling the intensity of concern with fertility and production that marks each of the seasonal breaks. At the conclusion of the evening's dancing, it is not uncommon in many places today to find the gathering simply disbanding. At the grave sites in Shinjo, however, torches are lit by individual families to send the spirits off. Meanwhile, just over the mountains, in the village of Mizuho in Shimane Prefecture, a candlelight procession forms and moves toward the river, where one by one representatives of each household place small boats, bearing the candles, into the current. As far as the eye can see the flickering flotilla plies on. When the candle goes out, it is said, the spirit has been released to the other world. III. CATEGORICAL CONFUSION Now, I recognize that the weight of comparative study argues for a sys- temic connection between ancestral rites and fertility, and that an equally persuasive case could be made for that connection in the Japanese in- stance. But the cosmographic argument I am proposing suggests that, at least in the case of Japan, the coincidence of these two types of ritual ex- pression is the result not of a homology between ancestral spirits and fer- tility deities, but rather of an analogy between two different but related aspects of otherness that impose on the community during seasonal breaks. In short, it is a consequence of the coincidental conflation of two symbolic vocabularies, one concerned with economic productivity and communal well-being, the other with the inevitable reality of death. We have seen how the ritual repertoire available to the community for expressing these concerns was expanded with the introduction and spread of continental soteriological beliefs and ritual practices. In some details of the summer festivals, in fact, these imported elements seem predominant. At the same time, there is ample reason based on 296</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions both ancient and modern evidence to conclude that Japanese attitudes toward ancestors are fundamentally different from those toward kami. In a compelling study entitled "The Songs of the Dead: Poetry, Drama, and Ancient Death Rituals of Japan," Akima Toshio contends that the cosmology we have been discussing is abundantly illustrated in ancient funerary practices.56 The spirits of the recently deceased were believed to linger along the barren or wild frontiers of the com- munity for a short while, during which time the grieving survivors could hope to entice the spirit back to the corpse and thus revive it. This type of ritual later came to be written with the Chinese ideographs pronounced chinkon and involved song, dance, and orgiastic entertain- ment. These funerary rites served an integrated function that later, un- der imperial auspices affected by continental culture, came to be bifurcated. The two aspects that emerged as independent could be termed "revitalization" (tama-furi) and "pacification" (tama-shizume). The former is now identified chiefly with the Great Harvest Festival (Daijosai), in which a new emperor is said to undergo a classic initia- tion ritual of death and rebirth, ostensibly reenacting a successful "re- call" of a dead soul.57 But it is not surprising to find, in the funerary rites reconstructed by Akima, that this "revitalization" ceremony was unsuccessful except in later mythic tales: it was a ludic prelude to los- ing the departed spirit to the other world, the world of the dead. And it was this playful aspect of funerary rites that involved "pacification," for the spirit of the deceased was feasted and entertained in a ritual charade intended to convince it that the surviving members of the com- munity sorely desired its return and grieved at the possibility that they would not succeed in their struggle with death.58 One of the images Akima cites is the pulling of a boat, which not only recalls the fact that coffins were often boat-shaped and frequently 56 Akima Toshio, "Songs of the Dead," Journal of Asian Studies 41, no. 3 (1982): 485-509. 57 I am not convinced of this interpretation, but it is widely accepted.

I am now preparing a historical study of the entire accession process, including the secret rites of the Daijosai. 58 Citing Frazer's compendious examples, Robert Campany notes in private corre- spondence that there is nothing particularly new about this interpretation of ritual play. 297</page><page sequence="26">Dancing with Spirit(s) transported by water59 but is remarkably reminiscent of the "tug-of- war" pantomimes still found in O-Bon. This marine motif is repeated frequently in ancient texts, which place the outer boundary between this world and the other on the horizon far out to sea. Other images, less grand in scope, locate the barrier at the visual horizon formed by mountains. As we have seen, both mountains (yama) and water are paradigmatic frontiers, the quintessential loci of ambivalent kami. In almost every instance, the spirit-traveler who crossed these thresholds was gone, never to return.60 This in fact suited the survivors just fine; if the spirit could be convinced that it was the human community that suffered by the death, that it was the spirit that was on the winning side of this tug-of-war, the spirit would depart knowing it was loved and the human community would be safe. For the ancient Japanese, like their descendants, were horrified by death and associated it with pre- cisely those characteristics of otherness-barrenness, wildness, pollu- tion-that threatened the community most. Small wonder, then, that the spirits of recently deceased members of the community were treated with the same ritual ambivalence as were the ominous kami in- habiting the hills and waters just outside the perimeters of the village. The bifurcation of the ritual process coincided with the implementa- tion of continental calendrical systems in the capital and the rise of po- litical intrigue as well, and this led to an understandable confidence of symbolic vocabulary, both linguistic and performative. Seasonal breaks became associated with the potential rapture of the cultural seams circumscribing the community, not only by amorphous kami of the woods and winds and waters but also by the vengeful souls of de- feated rivals within the aristocracy, and then, gradually, by the migrat- ing spirits of karmically bound peasants as well. It would seem, then, that the introduction-for both pious and political reasons-of conti- nental beliefs and practices fundamentally altered the religious world- view of the Japanese. And certainly the institutionalized tradition of welcoming the "returning" spirits of the dead at O-Bon would appear to justify that conclusion. Yet, as we have seen, these spirits in the ancient rites had in fact never left. They were, so to speak, in transit. Traditional O-Bon cere- monies retain the same structure of revitalization and pacification as the ancient funerary rites, but they have come, by coincidental analogy 59 Quoted in Akima, p. 48. 60 Ancient burial practices, that is, those predating the introduction of the now nearly universal custom of cremation, lend support to this observation in very suggestive ways, but cannot be pursued here. The mythic warrant for the sanction separating the realm of the living from that of the dead appears in the Izanami/Izanagi cycle in the Kojiki 1.7-10 (Philippi, 55-67) and the Nihongi 1.14-25 (Aston [n. 14 above], 1:21-31). 298</page><page sequence="27">History of Religions with seasonal exorcistic rites, to be considered a regular feature of the festival year. That is why I must insist that the spirits that return at O-Bon are not ancestors. Rather, they are the institutionalized equiva- lents of the newly deceased souls that lingered along the immediate periphery of the ancient village before their final departure. As ambiv- alent personalities not yet resigned to their fate, they are liable to be recalcitrant and therefore, like kami, must be pacified. They can float back and forth in the ambiguous zone between life and death, this world and the other, so Spirit Festivals were instituted as regular events to order and control their transgressions. Ancestors, on the other hand, are the impersonal representation of a collective memory, a memory that is both cherished and revered. This memory, this spirit, does not fade in and out of the civilized world. On the contrary, it is an integral part of it. It is a constant companion to everyday life, providing encouragement and conscience for the com- munity's activities. That is why the butsudan is considered the heart of every home, and why there is no consternation or confusion at the apparent inconsistency in locating the various spiritual presences at O-Bon or throughout the year. IV. CONCLUSION We have seen that two important summer festivals in rural Japan share many performance characteristics. I have argued that in fact their deep structure is homologous: both the Bug Festival (mushi-okuri) and the Spirit Festival (O-Bon) articulate a cosmology in which the agents of unsettling change are identified with the other world beyond the boundaries of cultured space. To control and accommodate change, which is to say to regulate the infiltration of otherworldly forces into human cultural space, the community has devised an elaborate system of ritual management. Over time, of course, the rituals themselves have been infected by change. In my examples, the most obvious changes have involved the introduction of various legendary or historical allusions, as we saw with the Nanjo dances. More subtle shifts have come about as a result of new ways of identifying certain of the otherworldly forces themselves, as in the case of O-Bon. These changes have led many, in their scholarly urge for taxonomic simplicity, to associate the apparently primitive rites of mushi-okuri with something called Shinto and to classify those rites dealing with the spirits of the dead (O-Bon) as Buddhist. As we have seen, however, such categories overlook certain sys- temic traits that resist conventional analysis. Uncertainty over the na- ture of the spirits of the dead and their locus has arisen from a theological confusion about the nature of kami and human souls (which 299</page><page sequence="28">Dancing with Spirit(s) are both ambivalent), whereas the study of these rituals from the point of view of cosmology has shown that the true distinction that must be drawn is between the unresolved spirits of the recently deceased (as well as other expressions of kami) and the ancestral, communal spirit of tradition itself.61 Matsuri, as the cosmographic expression of that communal spirit, continues to be systematically and effectively con- cerned with all the otherworldly spirits that inform this world. This study of summer festivals in Japan began with the premise that historians of religion need different ways to conceive of and organize our analyses of Japanese traditions, and has presented one example of how that might be done. In framing my argument, I have focused on the complexity of the ritual vocabulary that is inscribed in these festi- vals and argued that the grammar controlling this vocabulary is cosmo- logical, not theological as the Shinto/Buddhist dichotomy would lead us to believe. I suspect that a similar approach to the ritual traditions of other cultures, including those identified as Christian, would reveal equally unexpected challenges to the models we have for so long taken for granted. University of Colorado, Boulder 61 Origuchi was alert to the implications of this distinction but did not go far enough when he said, "The spirits that gather in the Other World are those of the ancestors; once there, there is no male or female, but all end up as a kind of generic spirit-all is sim- plified. They are not ancestors of particular households, then, and they return (to this world) as simply 'village ancestors'" (Origuchi Shinobu, Yanagita Kunio, and Ishida Eiichir6, "Nihonjin no kami to reikon no kannen sono hoka," Minzokugaku kenkyii 14, no. 2 [1949]: 8). 300</page></plain_text>
