<plain_text><page sequence="1">Himalayan Art: Wall-painting and Sculpture in Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti, The Siwalik Ranges, Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan. BY MANANJEET SINGH. New York: UN- ESCO Art Books, New York Graphic So- ciety, Ltd., 1968. 295 pp. Hates, Figures, Glossary, Index. $35.00. This handsome book is a work of con- siderable importance. The author, well known for his publications on Ajanta, is a member of the. Indian diplomatic corps, an enthusiastic student of the arts, and a fine photographer. The present volume could hardly have been conceived without this auspicious combina- tion of interests. Mr. Singh has visited regions which are even more difficult of access politi- cally than physically-regions which are the treasuries of fascinating and obscure works of architecture and art. Some conception of his probab'le difficulties can be gained from a mere list of the places to which he went in order to put together this introduction to Himalayan art. The book moves from Ladakh, Lahaul, Spiti, and the Siwalik Ranges at the north, down through Nepal and finally to the northeastern Himalayan regions of Sikkim and Bhutan. The territory covered is shown in a useful map, while a sense of the physical environ- ment is provided by apt descriptions and a number of breath-taking color photographs of landscapes and of the temples set within them. Views of temple interiors, or details of altar complexes equally set the stage and enhance one's appreciation of the many paintings and sculptures which are reproduced. The color plates are almost uniformly superb. Even more important, most of the sculptures and paintings have never been reproduced before. Interest in the sculpture and painting of Nepal, Kashmir, and other border areas has grown notably in recent decades, partly because the political situation has caused many formerly unknown works to appear on the art market, but also because we are becoming increasingly aware that these little known images often affected as well as reflected developments in the art of India proper. This is not surprising, when we consider that these northern regions were linked to the subcontinent by many pen- etrating ties of blood and faith and commerce, but it is a matter which, in the welter of other things to do, has never been sufficiently ex- plored. Mr. Singh's work will greatly aid such ex- plorations, even though it has a number of frustrating faults. In mentioning them, I in no way mean to belittle his effort or our very real debt to him. Like so many of the more handsome art texts which have appeared recently, this one has not decided upon its audience. It is too filled with unfamiliar terms and detailed in- formation about obscure dynasties to be read by amateurs, whereas scholars will wonder why it includes so many irrelevant (even if interesting) sections on everything from the stories of the gods to the problem of the development of the Buddha image. The author describes each illustration, but often does not give provenances, never gives measure- ments, and generally leaves one uninformed about the sources of the opinions and the information which he includes. From the bib- liography he excludes, as .if by fiat, all scholarly articles, and from the text, by a similar author- ity, all footnotes. Scholars will also be distressed that so much expensive I space is devoted to sketches of Tibetan life by a recently deceased lama, who should have stuck to other types of illumina- tion. Monochrome illustrations showing the context of certain details depicted in the color plates would have been much more wlecome, and would have added significantly to the very real fascination of this book. But per- haps we must become resigned to the lack of such aids in any such sumptuous publication. Images such as the Varaha from Dhum Varahi (p. 168), the Garuda from Changu Narayan (p. I72), and the marvelous stand- ing Buddha still half-buried near the Pashu- patinath temple (p. 203) show perhaps even more convincingly than the well-known striding Vishnu of 467 A.D. from Kathmandu (p. 170) the intimate relationships between the early art of Nepal and that of the Gupta empire. Our interest in Nepal, particularly</page><page sequence="2">868 JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES since the publication of Dr. Kramrisch's im- portant catalog, has already been shifted back toward these early centuries, and Mr. Singh's sensitive photographs can only augment this trend. The remarkably complex Vishnu Vish- varupa panel, also from Changu Narayan (p. 175), where the god is seen both as a kind of anthropomorphic axis mundi and as the reclining Narayana provides a credible eastern counterpart to the ambitious conceptions of the Kalachuris at Elephanta and related sites. These connections are of course confirmed by many other images, such as the Lakshmi from the Pashupatinath Temple (p. i83), and help in any attempt to develop an overview of the stylistic and iconographic development of Indian art in early medieval times. Mr. Singh's book presents such an embar- rass des richesses that the problem of choice is a hard one, but perhaps the fantastic array of painting and sculpture still in situ in the Alchi Monastery of Ladakh should be singled out as especially revealing. The main image is seated upon a sculptured throne (p. 43) which is a super-elaborated descendant or Gupta and early medieval types, with a scroll- ing makara arch, animal brackets, and attend- ant deities. The latter figures (p. 58), although largely repainted, suggest comparison with earlier sculptures from Fondukistan, while certain of the wall paintings (p. 63) in the same monastery have obvious connections with early Persian painting, and may reflect the lost murals of that tradition. Other paintings (pp. 47, 85, 27) while still reflecting certain Persian elements, are more closely related to the mural and manuscript traditions of me- dieval India. Mr. Singh presents us with a tantalizing selection of paintings from the monastery, but we need more data regarding their physical and iconographic interrelation- ships. The sculptured bodhisattva (p. 84), of which we are shown only the lower torso, has been crudely repainted in part. However the horsemen and Buddhas and pa-vilion-mo. tifs (p. 85) which decorate its dhoti may well be original, and instead of dating from the sixteenth-seventeenth century are certainly close in date to the murals showing devotees (p. 47) which Mr. Singh has dated to the eleventh-twelfth century. I would hazard that all of these motifs belong, along with the more obviously Persian-ish ones, to the end of the fourteenth or the beginning of the fifteenth century. Their style would seem to represent a remarkable continuation of the largely lost mainstream of the Indian tra- dition, preserved here in the remoteness of Ladakh, just as in another recension it had been preserved in Central Asia. To properly understand the pictorial structures of the Mehta Chaurapanchasika, the Vana Parva of 15I6, and Jain paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, all of which build in some- what different ways out of the ruins of this ancient style, we would be wise to look to the hills for help.
