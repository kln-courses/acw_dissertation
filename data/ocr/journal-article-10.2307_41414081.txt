Drawing on the forms and language of the United States Constitution and Decla- ration of Independence, the fiery seventy-six-page pamphlet makes an impassioned case against slavery and racial discrimination. In the preamble to Walker's Appeal , the author declares that his "motive in writing" is "to awaken in the breasts of [his] afflicted, degraded and slumbering brethren, a spirit of inquiry and investigation re- specting our miseries and wretchedness in this Republican Land of Liberty!!!!!!" (4-5).1 The four articles that follow preach the value of education, insist on racial unity, condemn the African colonization movement, warn whites of an impending apocalypse if slavery con- tinues, and, most controversially, promote violence as a legitimate - if not imminent - form of resistance. As the fragment quoted above suggests, Walker's pamphlet is not only ideologically ambitious and historically significant but also typographically radical. Although other black writers in the early years of the United States were deeply invested in the power of print, Walker is unusually sensitive to the power of every printed charac- ter on every page.2 In original printings and modern editions alike, Walkers Appeal is a graphic riot of italics, small and full capitals, ex- clamation points, and pointing index fingers (fig. 1). Though present on most pages of every edition, these striking visual elements have become incidental, if not invisible, in readings that focus on the place of Walkers Appeal in African American oratory, in arguments about the pamphlet s significance in the formation of early black print cul- ture, and in broader discussions of the relation between the written J © 2011 BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA J 55</page><page sequence="2">56 "Look!!

No, they would die to a man, before they would suffer such things from men who are no bet- ter than themselves, and perhaps not so good. Yes, how can our friends but be embarrassed, as Mr. Jefferson says, by the question, " What further is# to be done with these people ?" For while they are working for our emancipation, we are, by our treach- ery, wickedness and deceit, workiug against our- selves and our children - helping ours, and the ene- mies of God, to keep us and our dear little children in their infernal chains of slavery ! ! ! Indeed, our friends cannot but relapse; and join themselves "with those who are actuated by sordid avarice only ! H !" For my own part, I am glad Mr. Jef- ferson has advanced his positions for your sake ; for you will either have to contradict or confirm him by your own actions, and not by what our friends have said or (lone for us ; for those things are other men's labours, and do not satisfy the Americans, who are waiting for us to prove to them ourselves, that we are мк.ч, before they will be willing to admit the fact ; for I pledge you my sacred word of honour, that Mr. Jefferson's remarks respecting us, have sunk deep into the hearts of millions of the whites, and nevei will be removed this side of eternity.- For how can they, when we are confirming him every daj by our groveling submissions and treach- ery? la er. that when I look over these United State* of America, and the world, and see the ignorant deceptions and consequent wretchedness of my brethren, I am brought oftimes solemnly to a stand, and in the midst of my reflections -I ex- claim to my God, " Lord didst thou make us to be slaves to our brethren, the whites?" But when 1 reflect that God is just, and that millions of my wretched brethren would meet death with glory- yea, more, would plunge into the very mouths of cannons and be torn into particles as minute as the and the spoken word in early American poli- tics.3 None of this scholarship has looked closely enough at the print itself to discover that the typographic radicalism of Walker's Appeal lies less in its exceptionality as a ty- pographically unusual document than in the relation of its typographic form to its infor- mational and argumentative content and to its performance. Analyzing the graphic appear- ance of the pamphlet reveals the interaction of print and oratory (or visuality and orality), literacy and performance, and emotion and reason in this complex and powerful text.4 Comparing the three editions published during Walker s lifetime, I have found that the distinctive typographic features of the pam- phlet - its emphatic italics, capitalizations, punctuation, and pointing fingers (what Sean Wilentz dismisses as its "quirks")5 - seem to have been dictated by Walker, in his manu- scripts or in person, to his printer(s).6 The type in Walkers Appeal makes the authors outrage not just visible but also audible - readers can virtually hear his rising voice and anger in his text s italics, capitalized words, and multiple exclamation points. These typographic fea- tures help readers follow the pamphlet's in- structions to spread its word, showing them how to properly voice the appeal aloud and perform its affect for others. The italics, capi- tals, and exclamation points visually signal which words and sentences should be em- phasized and, occasionally, ironized, much like dynamic marks in sheet music (such as ffy indicating fortissimo, or "very loud," or a crescendo mark [&lt;]).7 Walker declares on the verso of the third edition's title page, It is expected that all coloured men, women and children,* of every nation, language and tongue under heaven, will try to procure a copy of this Appeal and read it, or get some one to read it to them, for it is designed more</page><page sequence="3">12 6.1 J Marcy J. Dinius 57 particularly for them" (2).8 Near the pam- phlet s conclusion, Walker further explains that he has written "in language so very sim- ple, that the most ignorant, who can read at all, may easily understand" (74). The language of Walkers Appeal and the visual form that this language takes combine to enable readers and auditors to internalize Walkers voice, his argument, and his emotions with the proper inflections. Using typography, Walker sought to collapse the ostensible binaries of voice and print so that his pamphlet would broadcast his message as widely as possible, converting print and literacy from means of control into instruments for advancing the freedom and equality of the enslaved and free-black popu- lations of the United States. Critical neglect of typography in Walkers Appeal is attributable to how we read texts phenomenologically, ideologically, and criti- cally. With the rise of the study of book his- tory, scholars have become more attentive to the materiality of texts, considering how bind- ings, types of paper, and variations among editions contribute to how we understand lit- erature. Even so, typography often goes over- looked. Paul C. Gutjahr and Megan Benton suggest that this is because an "ethic of typo- graphic invisibility has prevailed throughout much of modern Western bookmaking and publishing" (1). In turn, "[f]or most readers [the] formal, intermediate presence of print is so familiar and conventional that it is indeed virtually transparent and so unseen and un- pondered; we see only text on the page." But, as Gutjahr and Benton conclude, "it is im- possible to read the words on a page without also reading, albeit usually on a subconscious level, the visual text of the page itself" (2).9 In book history and print culture schol- arship, African American texts have received little attention, despite their increasing pres- ence in the expanded literary canon.10 In Afri- can American literary criticism, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., provides an analysis of the "talking book" trope that points to a way of considering the materality of black texts. He suggests that instances of "voice in the text" ( Figures xxxii) reveal "the curious tension between the black vernacular and the literate white text, between the spoken and the written word, [and] be- tween the oral and the printed forms of liter- ary discourse" (Signifying Monkey 131). Gates s attention to the "talking book" and its nego- tiations between print and speech has shaped much of African American literary criticism and black print culture studies.11 Yet such crit- icism tends to consider orality and literacy as the only registers in which people make mean- ing from texts. Examining the visual register of Walker's Appeal reveals a tension that is more productive than "curious." The voice and the emotion in the text are visible and thereby audible in its typography - in the printed form of words that Walker speaks through the text and wants voiced to those who cannot read. [■i Readers of modern editions of Walker's Ap- peal encounter the text as it appears in the 1830 edition, identified on its title page as the "third and last."12 Editors who use the last edition as a copy text must make decisions about what aspects of its unusual typogra- phy to reproduce and thereby about the ty- pography's relation to the text s meaning. The decision to reproduce an exclamation point, pointing index finger, italicization, or capital- ization from the pamphlet assumes that the element has meaning. Yet for the most part in these modern editions the typography is left to speak for itself beyond a brief textual note.13 In the most recent edition of Walkers Appeal (2000), Peter Hinks explains that he used Walker s third edition because it incor- porates "all the changes made in the second edition as well as the final changes made for the third." "The vast majority of the altera- tions," he notes, "correct typographical errors or reflect minor shifts in capitalization, spell- ing, and/or punctuation." Departing from</page><page sequence="4">58 "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!": The Radical Typography of David Walker's Appeal [ P M L A this fairly standard editor s note in seeking to dissociate form and content, Hinks as- serts, "None of [these] variations finally alters the essential message: that American slavery embodies one of the greatest moral abomina- tions in the history of the world, that blacks must refuse to submit to slavery any longer, and that whites must abolish it immediately if they are to avoid the swift, certain, and ter- rifying judgment of God" (Introduction xlv). Yet these variations in the editions do al- ter the pamphlets "essential message." What Hinks sees as "minor shifts in capitalization, spelling, and/or punctuation"- and I would add type ornamentation- are essential to the message of the text. Take, for example, a passage near the conclusion of the first Constitution-like article of Walkers Appeal. After noting that the growth of the United States following its "first Revolution" has led to an increase in the number of slaves, Walker asks, in the second and third editions, "Are we men!!- I ask you, О my brethren! are we MEN?" (19). By comparing this passage with the same in the first edition, we see that what Hinks describes as "minor shifts" in the text s capitalization and punctuation become more visible and significant. In Walkers first edition, this sentence appears as "Are we men?- I ask you, O! my brethren, are we men?" (18). This version fol- lows standard capitalization and punctuation: question marks follow both iterations of the rhetorical question "Are we men?" In this in- stance, emphasis is signaled by the repetition of the question, by Walker s direct address to his readers ("my brethren"), and by the inter- jection "O!" punctuating this direct address. But as readers can see and figuratively hear, Walker further emphasizes the matter of the question in the second and third editions. In the first iteration, "men" becomes "men," and the grammatically correct question mark is replaced with two exclamation points. In the second part of the sentence, the exclama- tion point following "O" is moved to follow "brethren," and the second "men" becomes the entirely majuscular "MEN." T. C. Hansards Typographia (1825) gives printers guidelines for the proper use of capi- tals, suggesting that their use has been considerably abridged of late years. . . . There are, however, some particular works, in which authors deem it essential to mark emphatical words with a capital: in such cases (and there can be no general rule to guide the compositor) we would recommend the author always send his copy properly prepared, in this particular, to the printer, or he will become liable to the charge the compositor is allowed to make for his loss of time in following his alterations. (426-27) Hansard explains that small capitals (as in "men") are "used for the purpose of giving a degree more of import to a word or sentence, than can be conveyed by printing the same in italic" (427). That "men" appears as it does in the third edition suggests that when Walker sent his copy to his printer(s), he indicated that his anomalous and even archaic use of capitalization was essential. These alterations transform what was a rhetorical and natural-philosophical ques- tion about the humanity of people of African descent into increasingly forceful assertions of this humanity. Walker's typographic re- visions rule out any possibility of a negative response to the question. When the question mark is replaced with two exclamation points in the first iteration, the question, graphically, is no longer a question. If the sentence is spo- ken aloud, the vocal pitch of the first part changes, from rising uncertainly (with the question mark) to deepening and strength- ening (with the exclamation points and em- phatic font). And as the sentence progresses from "men" to "MEN," it is even clearer that Walker demands an indignant affirmative re- sponse from his brethren. The increase in the typeface s height signals that the volume of his and his readers' voices increases here as well. Finally, and most important, this typographic</page><page sequence="5">12 6.1 j Marcy J. Dinius 59 shift indicates that when the humanity of free and enslaved blacks is so directly challenged, they will rise up - just as the typeface does - to prove that as MEN they are equal, if not superior, to whites. [»i The use of two exclamation points in place of a question mark in "Are we men!! - I ask you, О my brethren! are we MEN?" signals that the replacement is not a printers error - that Walker designated the typesetting of punctuation that would reflect his argument s logic and emotion. For Walkers Appeal , the use of two exclamation points is decidedly restrained; long strings of exclamation points are one of the text's most striking typo- graphic characteristics. In some of its most heated moments, the pamphlet deploys eight in a row, and in several fervent passages their number increases by one at the end of each successive sentence. We see such multiple and serial punctuation in one of Walker s many additions to the third edition. In this passage from article 4, the build-up of exclamation points (from one to eight) corresponds to the increasing extremity of the arguments against emancipation that Walker cites: They take us, (being ignorant,) and put us as drivers one over the other, and make us afflict each other as bad as they themselves afflict us- and to crown the whole of this catalogue of cruelties, they tell us that we the (blacks) are an inferior race of beings! incapable of self government!! - We would be injurious to society and ourselves, if tyrants should loose their unjust hold on us!!! That if we were free we would not work, but would live on plun- der or theft!!!! that we are the meanest and laziest set of beings in the world!!!!! That they are obliged to keep us in bondage to do us good!!!!!!- That we are satisfied to rest in slav- ery to them and their children!!!!!!- That we ought not to be set free in America, but ought to be sent away to Africa!!!!!!!! (68-69) In the age of word processing, strings of exclamation points are not rare; to signify an- ger, absurdity, or excitement, we have only to hold down two keys to add as many exclama- tion points as desired.14 It is easy to forget that when Walker's Appeal was published, a com- positor would have set each point manually, as an individual piece of type. Because this pas- sage comes from an addition that appears only in the pamphlet s third edition, it is reason- able to infer that Walker (in person or in his manuscript) dictated the number and pattern of exclamation points to his printer(s).15 This is worth noting because compositors since the Renaissance had taken it upon themselves to correct authors' punctuation (and spelling) as they set type from flawed manuscripts.16 Given such unconventional punctuation, the space constraints Walker s compositor would have faced in justifying his lines of type, and the limited number of exclamation points available in a printer s case, the appearance of all these exclamation points suggests that Walker some- how emphasized that the punctuation he speci- fied be reproduced exactly in this passage. We know from another passage in Walk- ers Appeal that the author took grammar se- riously. He closes article 2 with a lament that many "school-boys and young men of colour" whom he has met throughout the country consider themselves well educated but fail his examination of them on the "most simple parts of Murray's English Grammar" (35). Their failure results from the refusal of school committees and teachers to teach grammar to black schoolchildren, which Walker adds to his evidence of whites' deliberate effort to keep even free blacks ignorant and thus in bondage. In taking it upon himself to mas- ter grammar, Walker would have been famil- iar with Murray's entry on punctuation, the "art of dividing a written composition into sentences, or parts of sentences, by points or stops, for the purpose of marking the differ- ent pauses, which the sense and an accurate pronunciation require" (Murray 73).</page><page sequence="6">6o "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!": The Radical Typography of David Walker's Appeal [ P M L A Murray s emphasis on punctuation as a means of directing comprehension and speech illuminates what, at first glance, might seem an ungrammatical proliferation of exclama- tion points in Walkers text. The exclamation point, Murray explains, "denote[s] a differ- ent modulation of voice, in correspondence to the sense" (79). In the passage in which the number of exclamation points increases from an emphatic one to an outraged eight, Walker has taken to heart Murray s lesson about the relation between punctuation and voice modulation. His punctuation represents and requires a modulation of voice: as in the progression from "men" to "MEN," the reader hears Walker s rising voice by seeing its tex- tual approximation in each added exclama- tion point. And readers who follow Walkers instructions to read his Appeal aloud to oth- ers would correspondingly raise their voices with each sentence to convey the increasing absurdity of white arguments against black self-government and self-discipline. The additional exclamation points sig- nal not only Walkers (and his reader s) rising voice but also Walkers (and his audiences) rising anger, which grows in proportion to the outrageousness of the antiemancipation argu- ments. This is not a moment of uncontrolled rage (there are such moments in Walkers Ap- peal) but rather one of carefully measured emotions, from indignation to outrage to fury. This progress, this rhetorical and emo- tional logic (or counterlogic), and its intended effects on the pamphlet s audience (a counter- public) are most legible in the text s deliberate increase in number of exclamation points. In what is perhaps the text s most strik- ing emotional moment, Walker acknowledges feeling overwhelmed by the suffering and in- justices about which he is writing and by the act of writing itself, again by augmenting ex- clamation points. After cataloging the extent of blacks' degradation under slavery, observ- able in their willingness to harm one another, Walker declares, "Oh Heaven! I am full!!! I can hardly move my pen!!!!" (24).17 Hinks reads this moment and other such "spontane- ous outbursts" as "evidence of how emotion- ally painful and disruptive it was to directly confront the brutality of American racism." "Here," Hinks suggests, Walker ran the risk of "being unable to carry on his work due to the intensity of the experience" (212). Such a risk comes with "Walker s strategy for establish- ing the humanness of blacks" by "emot[ing] vigorously as a way to make clear that they were not dulled, beaten beings Varied and powerful emotional expression was essential to what was human, proponents of romanti- cism asserted" (211). Yet in this moment of writerly crisis, Walker may not be as close to the brink as he seems. Rather, this crisis is conventionally Romantic- a performance of an experience of the sublime, an experience that "charac- teristically begins with the interposition of an overwhelming force, which shatters equanim- ity and produces a feeling of blockage" (Otto 723), illustrated by Walker s "I am full!!!" and Thomas Jeffersons "violent head ach" that results from viewing the natural bridge in query 5 of Notes on the State of Virginia (Jef- ferson 22). "As this power takes hold of mind and emotions, inertia becomes transport: we are hurried on as if 'by an irresistible force'. As the experience recedes, it leaves behind a newly invigorated sense of identity" (Otto 723). Accordingly, immediately after Walker declares that he can hardly move his pen he continues with renewed force: "and as I expect some will try to put me to death, to strike ter- ror into others, and to obliterate from their minds the notion of freedom, ... I shall give the world a development of facts, which are al- ready witnessed in the courts of heaven" (24). This moment is an instance of what read- ers ranging from literary critics to those who put a bounty on Walkers head have variously read as an outburst, as a sign of his lack of education, or as evidence of his fanaticism. Yet a close look at the punctuation reveals</page><page sequence="7">12 6.1 ] Marcy J. Dinius 61 Walker again using typography to intensify the emotions performed by his surrogate, the printed text. Each added exclamation point marks the intensification of Walker s writerly experience of the Romantic sublime. When he recovers from this moment of shattered equanimity and blockage, the writing contin- ues and normalizes; periods replace exclama- tion points.18 In the typography of an extended foot- note added to the fourth article in the last edi- tion of Walkers Appeal, reasoned anger and unrestrained fury compete for dominance: In that Island [Jamaica], there are three hun- dred and fifty thousand souls - of whom fifteen thousand are whites, the remainder, three hundred and thirty-five thousand are coloured people! and this Island is ruled by the white people!!!!!!!! (15,000) ruling and tyraniz- ing over 335,000 persons!!!!!!!!- O! coloured men!! O! coloured men!!! O! coloured men!!!! Look!! look!!! at this!!!! and, tell me if we are not abject and servile enough, how long, O! how long my colour shall we be dupes and dogs to the cruel whites?- I only passed Ja- maica, and its inhabitants, in review as a spec- imen to show the world, the condition of the Blacks at this time, now coloured people of the whole world, I beg you to look at the (15000 white,) and (Three Hundred and Thirty-five Thousand coloured people) in that Island, and tell me how can the white tyrants of the world but say that we are not men, but were made to be slaves and Dogs to them and their children forever!!!!!!! - why my friends only look at the thing!!!! (15000) whites keeping in wretchedness and degredation (335000) viz. 22 coloured persons for one white!!!!!!! when at the same time, an equal number (15000) Blacks, would almost take the whole of South America, because where they go as soldiers to fight death follows in their train. (66 [fig. 2]) In this passage, the clustered series of excla- mation points again signify Walker's rising voice and anger, but here they also signal his growing incomprehension as he reasons through the statistics of domination and the odds of possible resistance, the extent to which Jamaica s ruling whites are outnum- bered by enslaved blacks. Typographically, the text helps its readers to understand this incredible discrepancy with their own eyes, commanding them to a[l]ook!! look!!! at this!!!!"- at the "15000 white" versus "Three Hundred and Thirty-five Thousand coloured people." When the number of whites is re- duced to Arabic numerals while the far greater number of blacks is written out in words and, thus, represented spatially, the blacks easily overtake the whites - if only on the field of the page. Yet Walker's careful calculations here lead not to a solution but only to frustration, desperation, a sense of defeat, and, at best, an- other problem of probability. Walker cannot comprehend how whites continue to domi- nate such large numbers of slaves; he demands of his fellow "coloured men" to tell him when their abjection and servitude to such a few "cruel whites" will end. After all, Walker con- cludes, if fifteen thousand death-dealing black soldiers would almost be enough to "take the whole of South America," surely the same number of slaves could take Jamaica (66). In this addition to the final edition of Walkers Appeal - perhaps demoted to a footnote for its departure from the greater confidence and insistence of the body of the text - the author seems close to despairing that such soldiers will ever rise up from the ranks of the severely oppressed, even if the odds are overwhelm- ingly in their favor. Here measured anger grows into a rage that morphs into incompre- hension; again, this transformation is most legible in the text s unusual yet deliberate and meaningful typography. [m I Perhaps the most noticeable and interesting yet the most neglected typographic element of Walkers Appeal is the pointing index finger</page><page sequence="8">62 "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!": The Radical Typography of David Walker's Appeal [ PMLA FlG. 2 Note on pages 71-72 in Walker's Appeal (3rd ed.). that appears throughout the text.19 This sym- bol (c ) recurs most frequently in the third edition, where it signals the beginning - and, when turned upside down to point to the left, the end - of Walker's additions to the text. For example, article 1 reads, "c Addition. - Remember, also to lay humble at the feet of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. . . . The man who would not fight under our Lord and Master Jesus Christ . . . ought to be kept with all of his children or family, in slavery, or in chains, to be butchered by his cruel en- emies. j" (13-15). In all three editions, с is also used to emphasize an important passage, as in article 2, where Walker cites and refutes Jefferson's claims about race in Notes on the State of Virginia: "[Here, my brethren, listen to him.] с 'Will not a lover of natural history, then, one who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye of philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those in the depart- ment of man as distinct as nature has formed them?"' (29; brackets in orig.). Both functions are evident in Walker's crucial note on the</page><page sequence="9">12 6.1 ] MarcyJ. Dinìus 63 verso of the third editions title page, where he asks readers to give his pamphlet their "candid and careful perusal" and solicits "all coloured men, women and children" who "are not too deceitful, abject, and servile" to "try to procure a copy of this Appeal and read it, or get some one to read it to them" (fig. 3). What should we call this symbol, this type ornament that allows Walker s text literally to point the finger of accusation at whites for the barbarity of slavery and at blacks for their fail- ure to resist? The back wrapper of the third edition uses the term brackets to describe how additions are indicated. In the text, though, none of the additions appear in brackets ([ ]); instead, they are enclosed by the same point- ing fingers used to emphasize the words "this work" on the back wrapper (fig. 4). 20 Bracket is not among the many names William H. Sher- man has compiled for ^ ; his preferred term is manicule . Since its first appearance in manu- scripts in the twelfth century and in printed books in the late fifteenth century, ^ also hás been referred to as the "hand, hand director, pointing hand, pointing finger, digit, fist, mut- ton fist, bishops fist, index, indicator, indicule, maniple, and pilcrow" (33). Regardless of what Walkers Appeal calls them, it uses these sym- bols traditionally (if effusively); according to Sherman, manicules historically were "used to highlight passages that were added to a new edition of an old text," but most often they point to "a passage that someone involved in producing or using the book considered worth FIG, 3 Title page (verso) in Walker's Appeal (3rd ed.).</page><page sequence="10">64 "Look!!

What is untraditional - even shocking, if only subconsciously - about the many manicules in Walker's Appeal is that they allow the author to point a visible, not just rhetorical, finger at those (such as Jef- ferson) willing to enslave others and those (much of his intended audience) willing to re- main enslaved.21 At least since Quintilian, through John Bulwer (whose influential treatises Chirolo- gia and Chironomia [1644] were dedicated entirely to hand gestures), to recent commu- nications theorists, a pointing index finger has been understood in Western culture as a means of calling positive or negative atten- tion to something or someone.22 In classical rhetoric, one's index finger, much like the manicule, is a means of emphasizing an ar- gumentative or discursive point; it can also be used for a gesture of reproach.23 In the Anglo-American legal tradition, the pointing finger of a witness has the power to indicate the person in the courtroom who was wit- nessed committing a crime or taking some other action. Yet in antebellum courtrooms it was rare that a black finger could be pointed at a white defendant, since most slave states did not recognize enslaved or free blacks as legal witnesses; in a number of free states, law or custom agreed with the South.24 In the case against slavery that Walker presents through his Appeal in the court of the pub- lic sphere - a case "already witnessed in the courts of heaven" (24) - the pointing fingers of the text s manicules indicate and accuse rhetorically and graphically those charged with perpetuating the "crimes of this nation" (61), even as the same gesture was unavailable to Walker in an actual courtroom. The manicules throughout Walker's Ap- peal also make visible one of the defining synecdoches of American racial slavery: the slave as "hand." In the gang system of slave labor, gangs were "made up of 'full hands,' 'three-quarter hands,' 'half hands,' or quar- ter hands'"- classifications that were "deter- mined according to the strength, age, or sex of the slave laborer" (Roland). Typically, adult men capable of the most arduous work were designated full hands; women, children, and weaker men were fractional hands. Whether we read the pointing finger of the manicule as a figurative quarter hand (for its display of one of four fingers, excluding the thumb) or rec- ognize the full hand in the name that we use for it ( manicule , hand , hand director, pointing hand), in Walkers Appeal this symbol can be read as a synecdoche for Walker himself. As Sherman has suggested, manicules "have an uncanny power to conjure up the bodies of dead writers and readers" (29) - an especially powerful association in the case of this writer, who died under mysterious circumstances soon after the final edition of his Appeal was published. Many have assumed that Walker was murdered for writing, publishing, and' insistently circulating his pamphlet, which encouraged slaves to resist their masters - vi- olently, if necessary; in slave states, raising a hand against one's master was an act punish- able by death.25 In this context, the manicules in the pamphlet- and, by extension, the pam- phlet itself- become Walker's and his readers' hands raised against every slaveholder to ef- fect the manumission of all the "coloured citi- zens of the world." M Walker famously concludes his pamphlet by pointing to the Declaration of Independence as the final, incontrovertible piece of evidence in his case against slavery.26 Immediately fol- lowing his challenge to the "candid and un- prejudiced of the whole world, to search the pages of historians diligently, and see if" any- one in history "ever treated a set of human beings, as the white Christians of America do us, the blacks, or Africans." Walker "also ask[s] the attention of the world of mankind to the declaration of these very American people, of the United States" (77). What he</page><page sequence="12">66 "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!": The Radical Typography of David Walker's Appeal j P M L A reprints from the declaration is typographi- cally unremarkable in the three editions of his Appeal. But immediately following the sentence claiming Americans' right and duty to revolt against absolute despotism, which concludes the excerpt, Walkers text reignites its rhetorical and typographic fireworks: See your Declaration Americans!!! Do you understand your own language? Hear your language, proclaimed to the world, July 4th, 1776 - ^ "We hold these truths to be self evi- dent - that ALL men are created EQUAL!! that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights ; that among these are life, liberty , and the pursuit of happi- ness!!" Compare your own language above, extracted from your Declaration of Inde- pendence, with your cruelties and murders inflicted by your cruel and unmerciful fa- thers and yourselves on our fathers and on us - men who have never given your fathers or you the least provocation!!!!!! Hear your language further! ^ "But when a long train of abuses and usurpation, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw oif such government, and to provide new guards for their future security." (78-79 [fig. 5]) These accusing manicules and exclamation points - imperative, emphatic, 'outraged- are consistent across the three editions, as are Walkers typographic alterations of the text of the declaration - the setting of entire words Fig. 5 Detail of page 85 n Walker's Appeal (3rd ed.).</page><page sequence="13">12 6.1 J Marcy J. Dinius 67 in full and small capitals and the italics that signal how Walker voices the words that all Americans need to hear.27 These typographic manipulations allow Walker effectively to rewrite the declaration, even as he quotes its language word for word.28 They also graphically realize Walkers demand that Americans hear and see - and thus under- stand-their declaration as he does. The plac- ing of "all" and "equal" entirely in full capitals visually distinguishes the two most important words in the most important sentence of the document; setting "men are created" in small capitals heightens the significance of the clause without diminishing "all" and "equal." "Do you understand your own language?" Walker demands of Americans in general and, given his previous challenge to Jefferson, of the declaration s author. To prevent misun- derstanding among his white and black read- ers, Walker typographically stresses how this crucial language should be properly read- especially aloud ("Hear your language"). Itali- cizing phrases and words - the claim that all men are divinely endowed with unalienable rights, "liberty" alone among the words for these rights, and "right" and "duty" in the charge to overthrow despotic governments - further rules out any confusion, deliberate or accidental. Here more than anywhere else in Walkers Appeal , seeing and hearing this all- important language, as the author visually and verbally emphasizes, is the key to understand- ing its incontrovertible meaning. For Walker, the verbatim language of the nations found- ing - especially the graphic form that this lan- guage takes as he has directed it to be reprinted and read aloud- becomes the most powerful means available to blacks for arguing for equal- ity and liberty, for cataloging the "long train of abuses" of slavery, and finally for throwing off the "absolute despotism" of whites. Yet the mere reading and understand- ing of his Appeal by blacks, Walker realized, would not be enough to cause the nation to fulfill its promises of liberty and equality for all. Thus, violent revolutionary action is a necessity in Walker's Appeal. This aspect of Walker's pamphlet moved it to the center of southern legislation and northern debates regarding resistance to slavery. On discover- ing copies of Walkers Appeal circulating in their states, Georgia and North Carolina leg- islatures passed strict laws regulating slave literacy and the movement of blacks and the texts they wrote. Walker was suspected of using sailors to circulate his pamphlet in slaveholding states, so ships entering Geor- gian ports were quarantined for forty days if black sailors were among the crew; black sail- ors were subject to imprisonment for coming ashore. Anyone caught in Georgia distribut- ing printed materials that encouraged slaves' rebellion was subject to the death penalty. Slaves were no longer allowed to work in print shops. And teaching a slave to read became a punishable offense, resulting in stiff fines or jail time.29 In North Carolina, "[p]ersons con- victed of writing or circulating publications, 'the evident tendency whereof would be to excite insurrection, conspiracy, or resistance in the slaves or free Negroes,' should for the first offense be imprisoned for not less than a year and be put in the pillory and whipped, at the discretion of the court, but for the second offense should suffer death without benefit of clergy" (Eaton 331-32). In the North, Walkers Appeal intensified debates among those most committed to ending slavery about what means were justifiable for doing so. Benjamin Lundy 's and William Lloyd Garrison's abo- litionist newspapers vehemently condemned Walker's pamphlet for its advocacy of vio- lence; moral suasion, both insisted, was the only proper abolitionist action. Such aggressively defensive responses sug- gest that northern and southern readers alike feared Walkers Appeal not only for its capac- ity to incite but also as a powerful agent itself. In the pamphlet's final edition, Walker touts the impact that his Appeal already has had: "But why are the Americans so very fearfully</page><page sequence="14">68 "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!": The Radical Typography of David Walker's Appeal [ P M L A terrified respecting my Book? ... I ask the Americans to see the fearful terror they labor under for fear that my brethren will get my Book and read it" (75). Such terror, I conclude, results not only from the threat of violent ac- tion promoted by his book but also from the graphic violence of the text itself. The striking typography of Walkers Appeal is the sign, site, and agent of this violence: with each stab of an exclamation point, each pointing manicule (or punch of a printers "fist"), every letter that rises up to become a capital or that rushes for- ward as an italic, the text graphically acts out its resistance. In the visually and rhetorically radical text that results, the masters house is dismantled with one of his most historically significant tools- movable type. Notes I thank William Huntting Howell, Alexandra Pappas, and Christopher Hager for their careful readings and generous suggestions in the development of this essay. James N. Green, Philip Lapsansky, Wendy Woloson, and Cornelia King at the Library Company of Philadelphia were especially generous with their expertise, materials, and time. My thanks go as well to Robert Levine, San- dra Gustafson, Teresa Goddu, and Jacqueline Brogan for their comments on earlier drafts. A portion of this work was undertaken with the support of a John W. Kluge Fel- lowship at the Library of Congress and benefits from my conversations with colleagues there. 1. Unless otherwise indicated, all citations from Walker's Appeal come from Hinks's edition of the text. 2. Every published slave narrative; the poetry of Phillis Wheatley; the letters of Ignatius Sancho; all the pamphlets collected in Newman, Rael, and Lapsansky 's Pamphlets of Protest ; the publications of the African Methodist Episco- palian Book Concern; and early black-published newspa- pers such as Freedom's Journal and the Colored American are evidence of Anglo-Africans' and African Americans' investment in the power of print to establish their human- ity and gain them their freedom. Walker's Appeal is at once representative of this commitment to print and dis- tinct in its microconcern with the actual type, which none of these texts exhibits to the degree of Walker's pamphlet. Of course, the power of print worked both ways: runaway- slave advertisements are prominent examples of how whites used print to deny blacks' freedom and humanity. 3. Representative readings of Walker's Appeal in rela- tion to African American oratory include Hubbard; Ba- con, '"Do You Understand'" and Humblest ; and Hinks, To Awaken 173-95. For examples of arguments about the pamphlet's place in early black print culture, see Levine; Newman, Rael, and Lapsansky; and McCarthy. The major studies of the significance of print or oratory and voice in the early national period are Davidson; Warner; Looby; Ruttenburg; Gustafson; and Loughran. 4. I use typography somewhat broadly, to include features of the text traditionally understood as typog- raphy-italics, small and full capitalization, and type ornaments- as well as aspects of Walker's punctuation. I place punctuation marks in the category of typography to emphasize their multiplicity, which requires several pieces of type to be set. 5. In the introduction to his 1995 edition of Walker's Appeal , Wilentz suggests that "[a] s a piece of writing, the Appeal captures the fascinating, at times uneven voice of a self-taught man of letters" (xviii). He offers the text's un- usual punctuation as evidence of the emotion and urgency with which Walker likely produced three editions of his pamphlet in a matter of months: "Walker's impassioned sermonizing, thick with Biblical allusions and punctu- ated with multiple exclamation points, occasionally lost the thread of its argument, perhaps because the author was composing and recomposing each edition hastily." "Still," Wilentz concludes, "with all of its quirks, the Ap- peal was (and remains) an arresting literary achievement" (xix). Yet recognizing Walker's attention to the graphic appearance of his Appeal makes visible how even its most excited moments were not "hastily" written and printed but carefully composed rhetorically and typographically to maximize the pamphlet's emotional, argumentative, and political impact. While arguments about authorial intention tend to delimit possible readings of a work, in the case of Walker's Appeal - written by a man with little access to education and published and circulated by him- self-recognizing traces of Walker s agency and their in- terplay with the text's self-generating effects does justice to the complexities of the author and the work. 6. Hinks maintains that Walker "more than likely" contracted with two Boston printers, David Hooton and Mathew Teprell, to print his Appeal (To Awaken 116nl). I use "printer(s)" to signal the possibility that multiple hands were involved in producing the three editions. 7. In Philadelphia in 1786, Francis Hopkinson pub- lished his "Plan for the Improvement of the Art of Paper War," a satirical essay in which he proposed "an improve- ment in the art of printing, so as to make it expressive not only of an author's narrative, opinions, or arguments, but also of the peculiarities of his temper, and the vivacity of his feelings." Hopkinson suggested that the "degree of vociferation, such as pianissimo, piano, forte, fortissimo, with all the intermediate gradations, [be] designated by the size of the letters which composed emphatic words"</page><page sequence="15">12 6.1 j Marcy J. Dinius 69 (qtd. in Silver, American Printer 145). As Rollo Silver recounts, Hopkinson proposed that "[p]earl to five-line pica" type "afforded the printer an ample scale. Mathew Carey printed the essay with each type size displayed when Hopkinson referred to it: a description of a news- paper quarrel begins in long primer, the reply to follow in pica, the next argument in great primer, the retort in dou- ble pica, and so on, concluding with five-line pica, 'which, indeed, is as far as the art of printing, or a modern quar- rel can well go'" ( American Printer 145-46). Fliegelman briefly mentions and reprints two pages from Hopkin- son's essay in Declaring Independence (56-57). While I do not mean to suggest that Walker was influenced by Hopkinson's essay, it is worth noting that Walker's use of italics, full and small capitals, and multiple exclamation points resembles Hopkinson's techniques for signifying vocal emphasis visually. Because of Hopkinson's call for different sizes of type, it would be harder for a printer to set a text according to his proposal than it was to set Walker's Appeal , with its uniform type size. 8. The asterisk indicates one of Walker's original foot- notes, which designates those "[w]ho are not too deceit- ful, abject, and servile to resist the cruelties and murderç inflicted upon us by the white slave holders, our enemies by nature" as his desired audience (2). 9. Similarly, White maintains that " Conventionally, perception of the graphic surface is effaced during read- ing by our interest in the words that compose it, but this does not mean it does not have an influence upon us" (5). He develops Genette's assertion that "[t]he typeset- ting - the choice of a typeface and its arrangement on the page - is obviously the act that shapes a text into a book . . . , [that] typographical choices may provide an in- direct commentary on the texts they affect . . . , and [that] no reader should be indifferent to the appropriateness of particular typographical choices" (34). 10. Foster offers a concise but thorough overview of African American print culture scholarship through 2005; describes the challenges that the history of black print poses to scholars; and, demonstrating the breadth of early black print culture, shifts our focus from strictly slavery- related publishing to texts generated by black "mutual aid, fraternal, and religious societies in the eighteenth century" (719). 11. Preceding Gates, Stepto also positions literacy and orality as the structuring binary of African Ameri- can literature. 12. Except for Garnet's 1848 edition of Walkers Ap- peal, which uses the second edition, all republications of the pamphlet have used the third edition as their source text. Greetham provides a concise overview of textual- editing theory regarding establishing an authoritative version of a text (esp. 297-346). 13. Aptheker explains in his 1965 edition that Walker's Appeal "is printed exactly as in the original, with the ex- ception that its paragraphing has been modernized. All spelling, punctuation, footnotes are as in the original." "In the original," he adds, "Walker occasionally emphasized a point not only through punctuation or italics, etc. - all of which are herewith reproduced- but also by the placing of a representation of a pointing hand; this last has not been reproduced" (60). Wiltse's edition of the same year notes that punctuation and spelling "have been retained as Walker used them, save that a few obvious typographical errors have been corrected" (xii). Wilentz's 1995 updating of Wiltse's edition repeats that "[e]xcept for corrections of some obvious typographical errors, Wiltse retained Walk- er's original spelling and punctuation. He also retained Walker's original footnotes," all of which Wilentz keeps as well (xxiii). In contrast to Aptheker, Wiltse reproduces and Wilentz retains the many right- and left-pointing hands that are scattered throughout Walker's third edition. 14. The "caps lock" function allows us to capitalize whole words and series of words by pressing a single key. In modern "netiquette," however, such use of all capitals is discouraged as "screaming" at one's reader (Crystal 117). 15. Bringhurst tracks twentieth-century developments in typography that allow for a more precise reproduction of an author's unusual punctuation as it appears in a handwritten manuscript (83). Brogan discusses unconven- tional uses of typography in twentieth-century poetry. 16. In his enduringly influential Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing, Moxon notes that "by the Laws of Printing, a Compositer is strictly to follow his Copy, viz. to observe and do just so much and no more than his Copy will bear him out for; so that his Copy is to be his Rule and Authority: But the carelessness of some good Au- thors, and the ignorance of other Authors, has fore' d Print- ers to introduce a Custom, which among them is look' d upon as a task and duty incumbent on the Compositer, viz. to discern and amend the bad Spelling and Pointing [punctuation] of his Copy, if it be English " (192). Joseph T. Buckingham's memoirs confirm that the same was true for Boston printers in the 1820s: the printer "sits up till mid- night, or till day-light, to correct [authors'] false grammar, bad orthography, and worse punctuation. . . . Suppose these productions had been printed as they were written. The disgrace would have fallen upon the printer" (qtd. in Silver, Boston 7). Given such editing by compositors and printers, it is reasonable to conclude that Walker intended his printer(s) to reproduce the multiple exclamation points and capitalized emphasis throughout his Appeal. 17. In the first edition of Walker's Appeal, this passage reads, "Oh Heaven! I am full!!! I cannot hardly move my pen!!!!!" (23). 18. Brody provides an extended consideration of punctuation in relation to performance. 19. If typography generally is invisible to most read- ers, as Gutjahr and Benton have suggested, E - is particu- larly "easy for scholars to overlook," according to Sherman, "[p]artly because it is so pervasive and partly because it is an anthropomorphic rather than an arbitrary sign (mimicking a human action that we come to understand intuitively)." As</page><page sequence="16">70 "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!": The Radical Typography of David Walker's Appeal [ P M L A a result, little attention has been paid to what the pointing fingers "are called, where and when they have been used, and which needs they have been used to serve" (47). 20. Murray addresses the proper use of brackets and с separately, just below his discussion of the exclamation point: "Crochets or Brackets serve to inclose a particular word or sentence. They are marked thus [ ]. An Index or Hand с « points out a remarkable passage" (79). In the second edition of Walkers Appeal, additions are enclosed in both brack- ets and manicules; in the third edition, only the manicules remain. Green suggests that the explanation of the use of brackets on the third edition's back wrapper may have been printed before the type of the third edition had been set. 21. From this point forward, I will borrow Shermans term manicule for ^ in Walker's Appeal , following his reasoning for this designation: "it is the most general, ac- curate, and neutral description of the symbol: it derives from the Latin maniculum , simply meaning 'a little hand' (in any posture). Another thing that manicule' has going for it is that it applies equally to little hands in all kinds of texts, and to those produced by readers as well as for them" (34). Since, as Sherman notes, "'fist' has its origins in printers' slang and should be properly restricted to the products of the printing press," I resist using this term because I want to leave open the possibility that Walker drew manicules in his manuscript (manicules in his own hand) and because hand had layers of significance in American slavery. We have no way of knowing what, if any, symbol Walker used to signal his additions to the text and to emphasize passages since we do not have his manuscript(s). Yet we can assume that he would have been familiar with manicules, which were widely used in antebellum print culture and signage. 22. Kita collects theories of pointing and its uses by and meanings across species and cultures. 23. As Quintilian explains of the gesture, "When three fingers are doubled under the thumb, the finger which Cicero says Crassus used so well is extended. This finger is important in reproach and in pointing things out (which is why it has its name [indice in Latin, index in English])" (qtd. in Sherman 48-49). 24. For more on the legal "disabilities" of blacks in the antebellum period, see Farnam (216). Ranney discusses continued efforts to limit African Americans' legal rights following the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (50). 25. Scholars concur that the rumors of Walker's mur- der cannot be substantiated and that he died instead of consumption (Hinks, Introduction xliv). 26. Bacon discusses Walker's and other black abo- litionists' rhetorical appeal to the Declaration of Inde- pendence as the document guaranteeing their equality with whites and their right to freedom ("Do You Under- stand"). Riss explores the opposite use to which the dec- laration was put in the nineteenth century. 27. The slight exception is the third edition, in which the middle exclamation point after "See your Declaration Americans" and the first after "ALL men are created EQUAL" are slightly lower than the others; this appar- ently unintentional variation only heightens the empha- sis and outrage suggested by the multiple exclamation points. In his essay "Punctuation Marks," Adorno notes that an "exclamation point looks like an index finger raised in warning" (91). 28. Neither Walker nor his printer(s) was the first to emphasize typographically the statement of equality in the declaration. In the Genius of Universal Emancipa- tion, for example, Lundy reprints an article from the Greensborough Patriot that criticizes slavery on the basis of the declaration, then cites the declaration with added emphasis: "This declaration, which jeopardised the lives, liberties and fortunes of those who signed it, and of those whom they represented, was based upon the broad prin- ciple, 'That all men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with the right of pursuing life, liberty and happiness '" ("Fourth"). The article appeared close enough to the publication of the first edition of Walker's Appeal that Walker or his printer(s) may have been influenced by it. Clearly, though, the typography and thus the empha- sis differ from those of Walker's pamphlet. And Jefferson himself used typography to emphasize the differences between the original and the official texts of the declara- tion: "As the sentiments of men are known not only by what they receive, but what they reject also, I will state the form of the declaration as originally reported. The parts struck out by Congress shall be distinguished by a black line drawn under them; &amp; those inserted by them shall be placed in the margin or in a concurrent column" ( Autobiography 33-34). 29.
