<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavations at Tell Qas?le, 1973-1974 (Preliminary Report) A. MAZAR Hebrew University, Jerusalem The sixth and seventh seasons of excavation in area c at Tell Qas?le1 aimed at examin ing the earlier stages of the temple uncovered during the 1972 season2 and establishing the sequence of development of the t?menos through its various stages. For this pur pose the excavation was enlarged to an area of 850 sq. m., and in several spots bedrock was reached. An examination of the bedrock levels indicates that the peak of the natural rock hill is to the east, with a sharp slope in that direction and a more gentle descent (5-7 per cent) to the west. The earliest settlement was established on the western slope, and the temple was situated on its eastern fringe next to the summit. stratum xii Temple 319 (Figs. 1:A, 2; PL 5: A). At various points above the kurkar bedrock, patches of lime-plastered floors and poorly preserved brick walls belonging to the earliest period of settlement (xnb) were found. Above this primary stage the earliest temple (building 319) was constructed. The building, measuring 6.4x6.6 m. (outer dimensions), consists of a single room. The brick walls, without stone foundations, are preserved to a height of 0.5 m. The northern and western walls are about 1 m. wide, the southern wall is 0.7 m., while the eastern fa?ade wall measures only approxi mately 0.5 m. Along the walls are plaster-covered benches 0.4 m. wide and 0.15 m. high. The floor of the temple is of beaten lime. At the western end of the temple is a plastered brick platform 3.36 m. long, apparently attached to the northern wall; 1 The excavations at Tell Qas?le are conducted jointly by Museum Haaretz, the Department of Archaeology of the Hebrew University and the Israel Exploration Society. They were carried out over a period of eleven weeks during July-August 1973 and in July and September 1974. The excavation staff during 1973 included: Bracha Goz, Hannah Fr?hlich, Osnat Mish, D. Altman, S. Kochavi, E. Lass, Y. Levi, M. Megiddon, S. Yankelevitz and A. Yosef. The surveying was done by A. Glusman under the supervision of the architect E. Netzer. During 1974 the staff included: Pamela Ullman, E. Lass, Y. Levi, M. Megiddon and A. Yosef. The surveying was done by Y. Por tugali. The photographers were A. Hay and Z. Radovan. The pottery was restored by Gina Golan and Lisah Hanninan. Pamela Ullman assisted in the preparation of the material for publication. The plans and drawings in this article were prepared by L. Ritmeuer, after sketches by Y. Portugali. The material in this paper is part of the author's doctoral research, supervised by Prof. Y. Yadin. 2 A.

The platform, which was probably the focus of the cult in the temple, is pre served to an overall height of 0.5 m. above the floor level; however, it is obvious that it was originally higher, consisting of at least three steps. The western side of the platform is covered by the western stone wall of the stratum xi temple and it is there fore impossible to determine its exact shape. It is possible that in the west of the temple, between its back wall and the platform, there was a long narrow cell measuring about 1.10 2.75 m. with an entrance at the south. Such small rooms appear in the temples of strata xi and x, but the existence of such a cell here is hypothetical. The eastern wall of the temple is preserved to a height of one to two courses and a width of 0.5 m. In its centre opposite the platform lies a kurkar slab (1 1 0.15 m.) resting on the bottom course of the wall and rising approximately 0.4 m. above the temple floor. The slab was probably the threshold of the temple entrance. The temple floor was discovered under a layer of brick debris; slight evidence of conflagration was found in two places only. On the floor was a pottery assemblage that includes an unusual Philistine vessel with a flask-type neck and handles and a concave cylindrical body (PI. 7: A). The vessel is decorated in the typical Philistine style with a stylized lotus leaf pattern. In addition, several offering bowls, votive vessels, etc., were found, although there were no other cult vessels. The Courtyard. On the east side of the temple, a spacious courtyard (110) reaching the edges of the excavated area to the east and north was discovered; at this point erosion had destroyed the later levels, and the courtyard of stratum xn was revealed directly below the surface. In several spots the lime floor of the courtyard was re paired and raised at least once. Above and between the floors were alternate layers of light grey and black ashes that contained an abundance of bones and sherds, including Philistine ware decorated with bichrome geometrical patterns. Three special finds are related to this courtyard: an anthropomorphic pottery vessel;3 a scarab with a chariot scene similar to one found at Tell Qas?le during an earlier season;4 and an ivory knife handle with its end carved in the shape of a ring. Fragments of the blade were found in situ, held by three bronze rivets (Pl. 7:B). A similar knife, recently discovered in Enkomi in Cyprus,5 is paralleled by finds from the Urnfields of central and southern Europe and Sicily, dating to the last centuries of the second millennium b.c. The Tell Qas?le knife is therefore an important indicator of connec tions between Palestine, Cyprus and Europe in the twelfth century b.c. It is one of the earliest iron artifacts found in this country. 3 Ibid., p. 69. 4 . Maisler (Mazar): The Excavations at Tell Qas?le (Preliminary Report), in, IEJ 1 (1951), PI. 37: B. 5 C.F.A.

North-south section through the western part of the three main temples of Tell Qasile, looking west. While it was impossible to determine if and where the courtyard was enclosed on its northern and eastern sides, on the south it was closed off by a long brick wall belonging to a house whose exact plan is still unknown. To the north-west of the courtyard is a long, rectangular brick-walled room which was part of the sacred enclosure. The area on the northern side of the temple was excavated only at certain points but it appears that a series of rooms backed on to the temple wall on this side, with either a street or a courtyard lying to the north. West of and parallel to the temple is a brick wall belonging to a building that stretches beyond the excavated area. As most of the stratum xn remains outside the temple were hidden by later strata, only parts were revealed by trial trenches. However, it is possible that several of the principles employed in the urban planning of the later levels originated in this stratum, such as the location of the temple and its courtyard, the long wall intersecting the area from east to west, dividing the sanctuary from the living quarters to its south, and the location of the street or square north-west of the temple. The ceramic finds in stratum xn outside the temple consist mainly of sherds. The absence of red slip and burnish and the comparative frequency of the Philistine krater with bichrome decoration against a white slip background characterize the assemblage. STRATUM XI Temple 200 (Figs. 1: B, 2; PI. 5: B). A new temple (building 200) was constructed in stratum xi directly above building 319. The new building is slightly larger, the external average dimensions being 7.75 8.5 m. The southern wall is built directly above the brick wall of the previous temple, the western wall has been moved slightly to the</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT TELL QASILE 81 east, the northern wall extends slightly beyond the limit of the earlier temple, while the eastern fa?ade wall is 2.7 m. to the east of the previous fa?ade, thus enlarging the building in that direction. The outer walls, built of kurkar stones, are 1 m. wide and stand to a height of 1.5 m. The entrance to the temple, 1.4 m. in width, is situated in the northern section of the eastern wall. The temple consists of a single room with the focus of the cult at the western end. The floor is of beaten lime; along the walls are red hamra brick benches. The interior space of the room is divided by two brick foundations at right angles, enclosing a space measuring 1.53 2.85 m. in the south-western corner of the temple; they are preserved to a maximum height of two courses and are probably the lower part of a platform, which hid the space behind them.6 The floor of this space was covered with a layer of organic material that contained an abundance of pottery, cult objects and offerings, and bones. Among the objects are a life-sized anthropomorphic mask fitted with small holes for attachment and openings for the eyes and mouth; two clay zoomorphic figurines; a sea-shell that was used as a horn; an ivory, bird shaped ointment bowl fashioned in a style similar to Late Bronze Age bowls (PL 7:C); approximately 800 small faience beads; and dozens of small votive bowls. Various other pottery vessels included red-slipped bowls, flasks and hand-made bowls decorated with indentations. In the north-west corner of the temple a rectangular niche-like space surrounded by benches was created. It is questionable whether the focus of the cult was in this niche or on the platform nearby. On one of the benches a lamp was found in situ, while inside the 'niche' three stirrup jars with typical Philistine decoration, including the bird motif, were found. In the same corner traces of cloth painted in red and blue were discovered; the cloth itself had disintegrated, but its traces were preserved. Only a few pieces of pottery were found in the remainder of the temple area, amongst them a globular chalice and a Philistine bowl decorated with spirals. The Courtyard. A fairly large area of the courtyard to the east of temple 200 was uncovered. Along the fa?ade of the temple was a strip 0.8 m. wide, paved with kurkar. Since it was about 0.4 m. higher than the temple floor, it was necessary to build a step leading down into the temple; the step, however, has not been preserved. The courtyard floor to the east of the kurkar strip was of beaten earth and reached almost to the edge of the excavation, where it has disappeared due to erosion. Covering the floor was a layer of organic material containing animal bones and a large quantity of potsherds. The floor level was raised twice. On its southern side the courtyard was enclosed by a long brick wall built directly above a brick wall of stratum xii. The new wall served as the northern wall of a large building which is not yet com pletely excavated. The north-west side of the courtyard is closed off by two rooms; 6 In the first preliminary report, Museum Haaretz 1972?73 Year Book 15-16 (1974), p. 62 (Hebrew), the space was described as a room. The later interpretation is based on new data of the 1974 season.</page><page sequence="6">82 A. MAZAR one is rectangular with brick walls without stone foundations; the other makes partial use of walls from the previous level while the remainder was built anew with stone. Among the finds in this room was a large basalt grinding stone. Reaching north and west of the rooms are floors related to a large, open area characterized by alternate layers of black and grey ash, probably a result of the incineration and disintegration of accumulations of waste material in the open areas. The Miniature Temple 300 (Fig. 1:D; PI. 6:A). The open courtyard stretches west of the temple until it approaches a miniature temple (300) that leans against the western wall of the main temple. In the courtyard in front of the former is an installa tion with a thick, lime-plaster layer that drained into a jar set into one corner. A grinding stone, apparently used in the preparation of a liquid necessary for the ritual, was found resting on the installation. In front of the temple, a narrow brick wall first built in stratum xn forms an entrance area, a kind of a porch, with internal measurements of 1.86 4.18 m. The building itself, built of brick, comprises a room with inner dimensions of 2.20x4.18 m. It is attached on its eastern and southern sides to walls belonging res pectively to temple 200 and an unexcavated house. The northern and apparently also the western walls of the structure stood independently. The temple is built on the 'bent axis' principle; its entrance is located on the eastern end of the northern wall, while the focal point of the ritual was in the south-west corner. Thus the worshipper turned a 90-degree angle to the west after he entered, as in the case of temple 131 in stratum x. The focus of the cult comprises two brick steps reaching a height of 0.53 m. above floor level. Brick benches are constructed the length of the walls; along the central axis three brick projections are arranged in a row, possibly to support the cult stands that were found inside the temple. The walls, steps, benches and projections are covered with a well-preserved, light brown plaster. Leaning against the steps in the south-west corner were three cylindrical cult stands, bearing a rich geometric painted decoration and either rectangular or oval fenestrations (PI. 7: E). Two ritual bowls were found in situ on top of the stands, each with a projection on its base which allowed it to be fitted into the mouth of the stand. Around the rim of one of the bowls are six attachments, consisting of the head of a broad-billed duck and its wings and tail, with painted details (Pl. 7:D). A third bowl of this type, undoubtedly belonging to the third stand, was discovered in the porch. The head and neck of a bird, painted in red with geometric patterns, were attached to the inside. Next to the stand was a group of 13 pottery vessels including goblets, globular goblets (one of which was painted with the familiar Philistine bird), chalices and lamps. The miniature temple was destroyed when the brick walls collapsed, yet there were no remains of fire. The southern wall collapsed inwards as a single unit and its plaster was found on the benches and floor. The brick debris, reaching a height of 1.80 m., is covered by a lime floor belonging to stratum ix. A test pit below the temple floor revealed a brick wall dating to stratum xn; the conclusion reached is that the</page><page sequence="7">excavations at tell qasile 83 miniature temple was established during stratum xi and continued to exist unchanged through stratum x. The Area South of the T?menos. South-east of the temple, most of the building re mains belonging to stratum have disappeared as a result of erosion and the stratum xi structures lie directly below the surface. Building 147, the complete plan of which is still unknown, apparently was established during stratum xn; in stratum xi it was renovated and its floor raised. The width of the walls and the large spaces within indicate that the building was not an ordinary private dwelling. On the floor, partly destroyed by trenches and pits of a later date, lay a pottery assemblage including a ritual chalice decorated with a bird's head and wings in a fashion similar to the ritual bowl found in temple 300. It seems likely, therefore, that this building was connected with the t?menos area, possibly serving as the living quarters of the priests or housing the temple administration. An interesting fact is that during stratum the building went out of use and a street was laid over part of it. South of temple 200 are several walls belonging to a stratum xii building (225) which was renovated in stratum xi. In stratum this structure was completely rebuilt. stratum (Figs. 3, 4) Temple 131 (Figs. 1 : C, 2). As a result of last season's work, the evolution of the stratum temple and the surrounding t?menos was clarified. The temple (building 131), excavated in 1972,7 was based on the previous temple (building 200), although the structure was replanned and enlarged. The northern, southern and western walls of temple 200 remained unchanged, but the southern section of the eastern wall now served as a foundation for the benches in the cella of the new temple. On the east, an entrance room was built partly covering the courtyard of the previous level. Inside the main hall the floor level was raised by about 0.6 m. This was done by building a frame of brick walls along the stone walls of the previous temple. Along the northern wall an additional course of stones was added, thickening the wall by about 0.25 m. The two stone column bases in the centre of the new temple were found to be cylindrical, 0.4- .5 m. in height and set into the floor fill (PI. 5 : A). The eastern column base projected approximately 0.10 m. above the floor, while the western one was found completely embedded in the fill, hidden by the stairs leading to the platform. To understand clearly temple 200 it was necessary to remove the platform and the brick wall behind; in this process an alabaster flask and a number of small pottery vessels were found. Apparently they were placed there as a foundation deposit when the temple was built. It should be noted that the raised platform of stratum was built directly above the cult installations of both the previous temples, even though the design of the installations themselves varied from level to level. f A.

Several problems concerning the arrangement of the courtyards outside the temple of stratum have now been clari fied.

The general area of the courtyard, in which foundations belonging to a square altar were discovered during the 1972 season, is approximately 100 sq. m. Facing the courtyard, against the eastern temple wall, is a brick bench. North and west of the temple is a second L-shaped courtyard (Fig. 4, right back ground) surrounded by stone walls which separate it from the street along its north. The entrance from the street was cut in the eastern end of the courtyard next to the small square room attached to the northern wall of the temple discovered in the</page><page sequence="10">86 A. MAZAR previous season. At the other end, the courtyard leads to the miniature temple (300) which continued to exist without change. A street, originating at a point west of the excavation, divides the t?menos from a building on its north. It is interesting to note that the corner of the building is curved to facilitate movement around the street corner (Fig. 4, far right). In the street itself were heaps of grey organic material and black ash stripes, typical of the open areas in all levels. Building 225 (Fig. 4, left background; PI. 6:B). The uncovering of building 225 south of the temple was completed. The dimensions of the house are 8.5x13.5 m. Inside the main courtyard are five flat stone bases to support wooden columns which originally divided the courtyard into roofed and open areas. The enclosed area was paved with a kurkar floor. Two square rooms are located on the eastern edge of the courtyard, one entered directly from the courtyard, the second entered through the first. The finds in this building are many and varied. In the courtyard, a number of vessels were found, including two imported jars from Egypt, kraters and jugs. In the room entered from the courtyard, rows of identical jars were arranged along the walls. A silo was built in the corner, and several clay basins and a Philistine jug with a rich bichrome decoration were uncovered. In the second room, five stirrup jars were discovered in 1972, all decorated with a Philistine geometric bichrome pattern. The building was destroyed by a fire, causing a thick accumulation of burnt organic material and the baking of part of the brick walls to a red colour. This con flagration is similar in nature to that which destroyed temple 131 and the rest of stratum throughout the tell. Building 225 is, in its general characteristics, similar to other houses situated on the south of the tell, though it is slightly larger and its plan is slightly different. The rich finds in this building, including Philistine ware decorated in a fashion hitherto unknown from the other stratum buildings, suggest that it may have served people involved in the service of the temple. It must, however, be borne in mind that there was no direct physical connection between the house and the t?menos. The entrance to the house was probably from a street to the west, beyond the excavated area. South of building 225, a section of a street thickly paved with kurkar was un covered (Fig. 4, upper left background), leading eastward and covering the brick walls belonging to building 147 of stratum xi, which by this stage had gone out of use. The road continues eastwards until destroyed by the erosion that left no remnant of stratum in the south-eastern corner of the area. STRATUM IX The thick lime floor first uncovered during 1972 was found to extend to the north and west covering all the courtyards, the street north of the temple and the miniature temple together with its courtyard. This floor was repaired two to three times, causing a rise in level. Further north and east, the floor was untraceable due to erosion, but</page><page sequence="11">excavations at tell qasile 87 to the west it continues beyond the excavated area. It seems that in this stratum, an open area was laid over the whole t?menos unit with the only partly re-erected temple in its centre. On the southern side of the excavation a number of stone walls and a round silo of small stones were found in the location of the stratum street. These remains represent a change in the street layout and city planning of stratum ix, which is also noticeable in the houses of area a at the south of the tell. stratum viii Erosion has destroyed most of this stratum. In addition to the buildings discovered in 1972, one can now add the remains of a floor belonging to an open area in the north-west corner of the excavation and a few sections of stone walls running parallel to the temple. The finds from this stratum are few, consisting of only a small number of sherds. 'stratum vii' The term 'stratum vn' was given to eroded earth layers that did not reveal actual building remains; the pottery, however, could be dated to the end of the Iron Age.8 Related to this level are two cuttings in the bedrock on the western slopes of Tell Qas?le, south of the Planetarium in the grounds of Museum Haaretz. In one of these cuttings, a pottery assemblage was found including, among other vessels, a jar, a deep bowl and several small bowls typical of the end of the Iron Age (seventh sixth centuries b.c.). These sparse remains are evidence of an apparently short period of settlement at the end of the Iron Age, after a gap following the destruction of stratum vm. The similarity of the pottery found here, e.g. hole-mouth jars and lamps with high bases, to Judean pottery seems to be indicative of the penetration of Judah into this area during the time of Josiah. stratum vi Several pits, dated to the Persian period though without any related building re mains, were discovered in the south-west and north-west corners of area c. Among the finds in the pits are a number of Attic sherds and a handle bearing a stamp im pression with the word *n(b7) written in Phoenician letters. A coin of Alexander the Great, discovered in one of the pits, dates the destruction of stratum vi to the late fourth century. * The stratum here described is not a parallel level to the stratum vii remains of previous seasons. It is apparently necessary to review the stratigraphy of this stratum, as it was published in the pre liminary report: Maisler, op. cit. (above, n. 4), pp. 195-202.</page><page sequence="12">88 A. MAZAR STRATA v-m No additional evidence relating to these strata was found during the latest excavation seasons. It appears that during the Hellenistic-Roman periods the settlement was limited to the upper and southern sections of the tell. STRATUM II Additional portions of the Byzantine bath house were uncovered in the south-west. In a stone-walled room south of the hypocaust, a rich assemblage of Late Roman Red Ware was found. One of the bowls bears an impression showing a seated shepherd, of a hitherto unknown type. In summary, the recent seasons of excavations at Tell Qasfle supplement our knowledge of the development of the Philistine t?menos during its five stages. We are now familiar with the earliest temple, the smallest and simplest of the series. It seems that during its existence (stratum xn) the urban settlement was at its very beginning. Some signs of a town plan already exist, but the population was apparently still sparse and the open spaces many. During the next period (stratum xi), a new temple was erected with the same orientation as its predecessor and a similar outline, though the actual plan was changed completely and the area enlarged. Joined to the main temple on the west is a miniature temple, apparently employed in the worship of a secondary deity. In the courtyard, rooms for use in the cult were erected; to the south of the t?menos is a large building, possibly connected with the functioning of the temple. During stratum x, the t?menos reached its peak in development and the temple itself was rebuilt using some of the previous walls. An ante-chamber was added and in the cella itself some far-reaching changes were made. The two temple courtyards were now rearranged to include one of the rooms from the previous level. In the south-west courtyard the miniature temple continued to exist unchanged. South of the temple, partly on the foundations of the previous level, is a large house. After the destruction of the stratum in a fierce conflagration, the t?menos area was re constructed, but the building activity was not as extensive as before, and many areas that were previously built upon were now left vacant. The temple was apparently rebuilt and continued in use. In the light of this development, it must be assumed that despite the destruction of stratum related to the conquest of the city by David, the population did not change to any serious extent and the local traditions were kept, as in the continuation of architectural traditions, expressed in the rehabilitation of the ruined buildings. In the next level (vni), the temple was once again repaired and the area north of it was reorganized, but the scarcity of finds in this level impedes its exact dating. After a hiatus, the site was once again settled for a short period at the end of the Iron Age, perhaps as a result of the penetration of Judah into the coastal region. During this period, the temple stood in ruins and above it eroded layers bare of building remains had accumulated.</page><page sequence="13">PLATE 5 A: Temple 319, stratum xn, looking north-west.
