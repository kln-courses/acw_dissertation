Bean There linger in the popular mind to this day many misconceptions about the Indians of California?misconceptions that they were a "simple" people, who gained their sustenance by "digging" for tubers and were so egalitarian that chiefs had little more power than anyone else; that they lacked any elaborate technology and did not alter their natural environment; that they rarely went to war; and that they are no longer a part of the California landscape. These views, although incorrect, are seen so often in the popular litera ture dealing with the Indians of California that they have made it difficult for an accurate picture presented by anthropologists, historians, and the Indians themselves to be accepted. For the most part, the native peoples who occu pied California before European contact, with the exception of those living in the state's eastern deserts, reached levels of socio-cultural develop ment and complexity rarely encountered among peoples with a hunting-and-gathering or proto agricultural subsistence base. The people of the eastern California deserts, on the other hand, could not enjoy the cultural largeness of their mountain and coastal neighbors because of environmental circumstances. Hence they lived in small, highly mobile groups with fewer of the material and social advantages enjoyed by their neighbors, developing instead consumate skills in subsistence adaptation. California contained over one hundred distinct cultures organized into non-political, ethnic nation alities, with member units both sharing a similar culture, history, religious system, and philosophi cal tradition and occupying a territory acknowl edged to be theirs. Every language family known in North America, except Eskimo, was represented in California, indicating not only that the region was culturally diverse, but also that it was one of the first to be populated and that it had been occu pied for a long time. These many distinct peoples lived side by side in a relatively stable socio-cultural milieu, maintaining separate identities and, at the same time, sharing ideas and assets. This cultural diversity, no doubt, persisted in part because the state's geological landscape made travel from one ecological zone to another inconvenient. Archaeological and linguistic data suggest that Cal ifornia peoples were politically sedentary and sta ble for several thousand years prior to European contact. The political stability was in large part due to fortunate environmental potential, and, in part, to the many generations of adaptation to specific environments made possible by the relative isola tion the varied terrain provided. In addition, the state's rich ecological diversity?encompassing sea coast, tidelands, rivers, mountains, valleys, foot hills, deserts, and lake areas?has contributed to cultural diversity. Moreover, numerous varieties of local environmental micro-niches provided advan tages and disadvantages to human adaptation and cultural development.1 Over the years people acquired a scientific knowl edge of the natural resources in their territories and invented production systems (tools, division of labor systems, and ecologically adaptive social mecha nisms) specific to each environment. The natural potential of the environment was utilized by means of sophisticated technologies and land manage ment techniques for exploiting food resources from the sea, plains, and mountains. These included burning groundcover to replenish the soil, culling animal and insect populations that threatened an ecozone, replanting species, and pruning plants and trees.

These institutions interlocked peoples who lived in environments with different resources and pro duced a flow of goods from one group to another that allowed the exchange of surplus foods for "bankable" hard goods, such as baskets, or rare items, such as steatite. This essentially sophisti cated, international exchange system balanced out useful or desired resources between groups and guaranteed that resources would be shared by many peoples, not just those in whose territory the resources were abundant. Additionally, the recip rocal distribution of foods and other goods at major religious events created a venue that could act as a market system, where surplus goods as well as services could be exchanged for "money" or other goods and services.3 304 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="4">Cahuilla Indian well at Torres on the southern Califor nia desert. Although the photograph is dated 1903, wells such as this were reported by early foreign travelers in the area. Even before Europeans or their cultural influ ences arrived in the region, Cahuilla, like many other desert tribes and the Paiutes of the Owens River Valley, irrigated crops in the resource-poor desert to augment their food supplies. Along with the pruning and transplanting of wild plants to increase yield, the use of controlled fire-burning to improve grasslands and wildlife numbers, and the development of tribal rules and rituals to protect ecological balances in their terri tories, agriculture exemplified the California Indians' application of careful resource management principles that in many ways prefigured modern practices. CHS I Ticor Collection, University of Southern California. World View Although California Indians had a number of different religious systems, they shared, and to a great extent continue to share, a view of the world that differs in a number of respects from that of Euro-Americans. The universe was understood to be hierarchically structured into three worlds: the first, an upper world populated by powerful anthropomorphic beings such as the astro nomical persons Sun, Moon, and the various con stellations, forerunners of animal species and other spirit beings; the second, a middle world peopled not only by human beings, but also by various non mortal beings with considerable power; and third, an underworld peopled by super-ordinary beings, usually unfriendly toward humans. These latter beings were conceived of as reptilian, amphibious, or distorted humanoid in form and were associated with water, springs, underground rivers and lakes, and caves.4 This world view did, and does, however, have points of similarity with the modern physicist. For example, the universe was considered entropic, having diminished in quality, quantity, and availa bility since the beginning of time. Moreover, Native Californians equated power with knowledge, a view consistent with the physicist's equation of power with information.5 The universe, according to this view, is suffused with power. Power is sentient, quixotic, and often uncommitted in intent; it is the principal causative agent. It can be used for (or cause) "good" or "bad" effects. It is possessed by anything that lives or has the will to act, but human beings are central among all those who hold power. Some animals have extraordinary degrees of power, often being "were-animals," that is, persons who can transform from one lifeform to another. In addition, every subsistence resource holds power, as even inanimate objects may. They manifest this power, on occasion, as when a seemingly power less rock rolls down a hill and is associated with a transformational effect, thus revealing itself as a source of power.6 People thus live in a powerfully beneficial world, but one fraught with danger, for they can never be absolutely certain whether anyone is a power source until tested or the power reveals itself. As a pri mary precaution, all things, as fellow sentient beings, must be treated with respect.7 FALL 1992 305</page><page sequence="5">Human beings are the central figures in an interacting system of power holders. They have been provided with guidelines for acquiring, keep ing, and wielding power. Hence religious persons, such as priests and shamans who know these guidelines, are extremely important socio-political figures. They guide their people, primarily by rit ual action, in dealing rationally with other power holders through a system of reciprocal rules handed down to humans in early cosmic times.8 Religion Throughout native California, religious institu tions were intensely and intimately associated with all other institutions?political, economic, social, and legal. In all the groups there were shamans?religious leaders who served as inter mediaries between the supernatural world and the world of man?and among most, priests and ritualists as well. Although intimately associated with the religious system (e.g., priests and ritualists), shamans were, nevertheless, independent religious personages who received their powers of intellect, medical knowledge, and influence over natural forces, such as game animals, rain, and plant production, independently from personal guardian spirits, the demigods of the sacred world. Shamans received a special "calling" from such beings or were trained or born with power. They were, consequently, somewhat independent of other authority and capable of innovation and change in a manner useful to cultures that had highly institutionalized priesthoods. It was the shamans who served as the general cultural heroes to native peoples in a dra matic and visible manner. They were responsible for predicting the future, anticipating need, and suggesting changes in the institutions. They acted as political intermediaries between and within groups and as policing agents. Their powers were demonstrated by special abilities, such as seeing into the future, controlling or causing spectacular natural events, curing diseases, causing disease and death, transforming into other forms in order to visit other worlds, handling fire, and the like.9 The priesthood maintained a balanced order of ritual and behavior over long periods of time. Priests and ritualists held multi-functional roles. Priests had political, legal, and economic, as well as reli gious, ritualistic, and philosophical authority. Ritualists?those who conducted the activities necessary for religious ceremonies, (managers, singers, dancers, fire-tenders, and the like)? were also persons of considerable rank within the ____|_|_SkI4:': -:- ?H^'' ' _(!**.. __B_E___Ep^ &lt; _________ ::-.rf;;sSKj;!^.?-..???.:.'

These persons were the most directly allied, as were shamans, with the great powers of the universe, often having direct contact with supernatural beings, sometimes transforming into such beings, and possessing or having the power to become conductors of power. They were persons who mediated between the sacred and secular worlds. They were, then, as they still are, elite people within Indian communities.10 Precision in the conduct of religious duties was necessary to maintain a correct balance in the com plex cosmology. Hence, Native Americans required that people were well-trained, highly committed to their traditions and culture, and willing to "sacrifice" for their people. They were rewarded accordingly with great prestige, honor, special favor, and position.11 There were ritually-induced rules to be followed with respect to both plant and animal resources, and when the main rules for appropriate subsist ence acquisition were applied, those powers that could facilitate the subsistence processes were enjoined for successful results. Days of ritual dances often preceded the harvest of major foods such as acorns or pinon nuts. Hence leaders could arrange and manage the collection procedures in a manner best suited, most equitable and efficient for a given resource's productive capacity in a particular area. FALL 1992 307</page><page sequence="7">Similarly, men who were about to go hunting sexu ally avoided their wives and ritually purified them selves in order to better prepare for the arduous tasks involved. The tools with which resources were harvested and processed were likewise treated with respect?carefully and exactly made, addressed with prayers before use, and used in a manner decreed as proper. This careful attention to what ever economic process was at hand resulted in the splendid craftsmanship and aesthetically pleasing quality of so many California Indian objects? projectile points, baskets, and the like. Moreover, when the main rules for appropriate subsistence acquisition were applied, those powers that could facilitate the subsistence processes were enjoined for successful results. Two religious systems, the Kuksu and the Tolo ache, were associated with social organizations into which initiates were formally indoctrinated. In the Kuksu religion of northern California (among the Porno, Yuki, Maidu, and Wintun), members "impersonated" spiritual beings and engaged in very distinctive, colorful, and dramatic rituals using special paraphernalia, costumes, and equipment. These ceremonies were usually held in large public communal houses. Within the Toloache religion of south-central California (among the Luiseno, Diegueno, and Yokuts), initiates performed while drinking a hallucinogenic decoction made from datura meteloides. This put them into a trance and allegedly provided them supernatural knowledge about their future lives and roles as members of these sacred societies. In both religions, special instruction was a significant factor in the recruit ment of members into the ritual society. In addi tion, members exercised considerable economic, political, and social influence. Religions found along the Colorado River differed somewhat from the Kuksu and Toloache systems in that, for these peoples, greater emphasis was placed on the dreams of individuals as a source of knowledge. Members recited long narrative texts that explained the creation of the world, the travel of culture heroes, and the adventures of historic figures.12 In the northwest there was another formalistically structured religious system. It was associated with rituals (e.g., the white deerskin and jump dances) concerning the return or renewal of the world to a pristine sacred state. During these rituals, privately owned myths were recited. One communal need served by these ceremonies was that of restructuring relationships in societies that lacked the rigid social ordering found in many other native California groups. The display of costumes and valuable pos sessions (such as white deerskins or delicately chipped obsidian blades) reaffirmed social ranking. The success of the ritual reaffirmed the orderly relationship of man to the supernatural and the consequent repair of the world.13 The use of supernatural power to control events or transform reality was basic to every California group. Generally, magic was used in attempts to control the weather, increase the harvest of crops, and foretell the future. On the other hand, magic was deemed both a cause of sickness and death and the principal means for curing many diseases. Additionally, magic was sometimes considered an agent to protect oneself, to punish wrong-doers, or to satisfy personal ends.14 Subsistence Patterns Subsistence patterns?those ways in which peo ple acquire food energy from their area?varied, of course, with the environmental setting. The most abundant and richly varied settings were in those areas along the coast that also had convenient access to the interior, as in northwestern California and in the coastal sections of present-day Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties. Other equally favored environmental settings were those along the shores of inland lakes, as well as particular spots along major rivers. In such places, fish and other aquatic foods enriched an already rich, land-based subsistence base. For example, many inland lakes were on the Pacific Flyway for migrating birds and supported abundant growth of tule. On the other hand, resources were less abun dant in the mountains and deserts. In the moun tains, populations often centered where oaks were clustered and pinon, a back-up staple, was within walking distance of the community's central place. Peoples living along the northwest coast used canoes hollowed out of redwood logs for travel and fishing; those along the southern coast made boats from wooden planks that had been lashed and asphalted together to create watercraft of remark able complexity and strength; those along San 308 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="8">_^B^HfflB^?_fflS__ilH ^^^^_^_lmHP|lS^__^__^__^__B__^^Bn|iP^^ "".oj[_]^j_t|||||B .rffi*: .1* ,\&amp;?k!J^ *^?^ilill^^ ~**j ?*,.** * !i5*B*?_r*,-?i* ____BBHIliliililiiliW . * * *.~"* ,*!r,?'S44x,*'i.? ?!.' ^^j^MJ^^^S^^S^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ a. * * *j* ^BB_BBlBsllflE_^ -*'' "" ..;' ";,?- ' '' i'''^S^^1ll|p-l"^ll^^^^^^^^^^S '^^'^r' "" '' Sll Replica of a plank canoe, which the Chumash of the Santa Barbara Channel area used to harvest sea mammals and other ocean foods from the coast, channel, and off-shore islands.

Courtesy Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Francisco Bay had boats and rafts made from tule lashed together, a type of craft also favored on inland lakes. Coastal people carried out most fishing from the shores of the ocean, but they also undertook deep-sea fishing or trading expeditions between islands off the coast and the mainland. They used harpoons, spearthrowers, and clubs for hunting sea mammals. Everywhere, whether fish ing from the coastal shore or from the banks of rivers and streams, people used hooks and lines, nets, basketry traps, spears, or bows and arrows for catching fish. They sometimes used vegetable poi sons to stun fish, making them easier to capture. On the coast, they collected crustaceans and mol lusks. Abalone was a particularly favored food.15 Individual men or teams of hunters hunted large game animals?animals such as elk, deer, mountain sheep, and antelope, and in some cultures, bear? with bow andarrow. Cooperative efforts were espe cially helpful in hunting antelope, rabbits, and sea mammals. Birds and smaller game, such as wood rats, mice, squirrels, reptiles, and rattlesnakes, were captured using deadfalls, snares, traps, throwing sticks, or bow and arrow. Burrowing animals were smoked from their holes and clubbed to death.16 As with faunal resources, floral resources pro vided for each group hundreds of possibilities for foods, medicines, and construction materials. Acorns, pinon nuts, mesquite and screw beans, agave, and grass seeds were staples of the diet. The seeds and fruit of manzanita, sunflower, sage, lemon berry, juniper, holly-leaved cherry, and cacti were also important foods.17 Division of Labor The Indians of California maintained a very strong work ethic. Men, women, and children, young and old, contributed to the good of the group of which they were a part. Among the useful rules for life was that of reciprocity, reflected in the fact that hunters and fishermen were often obligated to share the meat of a large game animal with certain kinfolks or at a ritual with the com munity at large. Similarly, when there was an especially abundant production of a food resource, the collection and use of the excess collected was shared by many.18 Work activities often overlapped. Men aided women in the acquisition of plant foods. In the gathering of acorns, for example, men helped with the heavy work, such as knocking acorns from the trees and collecting firewood. They sometimes FALL 1992 309</page><page sequence="9">collected plant foods or other basket resources on hunting expeditions. Women, in turn, sometimes hunted and trapped small game and collected shellfish. Men tended to have responsibility for the formal conduct and needs of ritual and sacred affairs, such as acquiring food and preparing cere monial equipment, while women prepared food for ritual events and performed supplemental danc ing and singing.19 Able-bodied men carried out most of the heavy, but short-term labors. They hunted, fished, assisted in some plant gathering and processing activities, conducted most trading ventures, managed most rituals (which were significant economic, as well as sacred, events), and engaged in defense and warfare. Older men were most active in ritual and ceremonial affairs, developing political decisions, and teaching selected young men. Skilled net and arrow makers, they manufactured much of the capital equipment used in hunting, as well as the ceremonial paraphernalia. In addition, the older men taught the young manufacturing skills and knowledge about their culture, through story tell ing, anecdote, historical review, and sacred texts. Men, in effect, were in charge of the sacred world.20 Women, on the other hand, were associated with the secular world. Women collected and prepared most plant and animal food resources. Aged women stayed close to home to care for children, teaching them arts, skills, and the knowledge, practical and esoteric, necessary for adulthood. Younger, more active women collected and processed foods, and produced baskets, pots, and clothing. Children were involved in productive activities at the earliest possible age. Boys and girls learned about tasks as they worked with adults. Older, unmarried girls assumed care for younger siblings. Through games many children learned the skills necessary for adulthood, including manual dexter ity, accuracy in throwing, quickness in reaction time, patience, and attention to doing things well. Men and women owned their tools and equip ment, whether they bought them from a master craftsman or made them themselves. Older people taught younger people the sophisticated ways of hunting, fishing, and collecting. Those children especially talented in some respect received special instruction and could become specialists, to be rewarded accordingly with elevated status and extraordinary income.21 ____ 'M N^flHj^llll^pS^ i;#__ "'.. :' '"': ;S:-i'v :.fo. i'IJIIItiB W&amp;^BmStw^m _fflA-^ 1^^S__B-ilt_F^ '^'^^^^^^MSM^^^^^^^^^^^^ BR_^I-______9BHwvIm5____e,^^^S^^^_L f^^_____________l_______________i ______________BrP^?^__BBBiV_k?_^__^-BL Mi BE_______HP^B^^^n f*_;:* . . ~;*:'igi^yl^pW^P^::."..."Ml;{* h 1 I *^B!!_- J^^^^BP^^*^ il____B * ~_j^^w__j^8r-_j "^ i-^^^^ ^ - -d ' M &lt;, .^IBf J__________^'\ii^3^l^_eB^_H Woman, probably Hupa, with burden basket, early 1900s, from a photograph album of Grace Nicholson.

Courtesy Huntington Library. Food Acquisition and Preparation Women used a wide range of baskets, bowls, and other tools to gather and process foods. For example, seed beaters were used to collect seeds; net bags were used to carry seeds, cactus buds, fruits, and nuts. Seeds were parched in baskets or clay plates before they were ground. Acorns and 310 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="10">other foods were ground in stone or wooden mor tars with stone or wooden pestles, and dry seeds were ground in stone metates with stone manos. Carefully made baskets were used for sifting ground flour and for leaching acorns to remove their tannic acid. Southern California peoples both cooked and sealed many foods in pots to preserve them from season to season and used large woven granaries to store abundant food reserves of acorn, pinon nuts, and mesquite beans. Cooking vessels, includ ing baskets into which hot rocks were placed, and clay or steatite pots, were used to make porridges, breads, tortillas, and cakes. Meat was prepared by baking, boiling, broiling, or parching it in baskets, pots, pits, or over open fires. Meat and fish were either eaten fresh or smoked or dried in the sun for future use. Nets were also made for a variety of purposes. Net pouches of two and three-ply cordage were made for handling the fruit and young pods of cactus. Nets or skin pouches and bags were also used to carry or store small game and other foods. Large back-carrying nets, which allowed an indi vidual to carry heavy burdens over long distances, were supported by a tumpline around the forehead. A community's boundaries generally included several ecozones, so that the group's subsistence activity could range between valley and mountain or inland and coastal ecosystems, thereby follow ing the ripening pattern of plants and the local movement patterns of fish and game. Communi ties were usually located in ecologically optimal areas where both water and, within a mile or two, most of the plants used as food, were available. Among the Cahuilla of southern California, for example, it has been found that eighty percent of a community's resources were within an easy day's journey. Some major food resources, such as acorns and pinon nuts, however, were located as far as five to eleven miles away and abundant enough that several days or weeks away from home would be required to gather them. Hence, some people in the community took short-term journeys, lasting days or weeks, to acquire enough food for a comfort able season's reserve. At the same time they would gather other foods, such as reptiles, amphibians, insects, and larvae, as well as material resources, on these subsistence trips. The bones, vertebrae, shells, feathers, and fur thus acquired provided useful materials for items such as tools and clothing.22 Settlement Patterns In California, there were thousands of Indian communities, and hundreds of politically distinct groups to which these communities belonged. Con servative estimates suggest a population of 325,000 people living throughout California at the time of European contact in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Henry Dobyns has recently suggested that as many as 1,000,000 people lived in the state.23 Each community had specific hunting, collecting, and fishing areas located in diverse ecological zones. Typically, villages were located in valley bottoms, along streams and coastal strands, near springs, in low mountain valleys, atop alluvial fans, or in canyons. They were usually sited in sheltered coves or on the sides of slopes in a warm thermal zone, near good water supplies, and in good defen sive locations, a condition more necessary after European contact. As noted above, communities were usually within reasonable walking distance of a significant por tion of their food resources. If not, each year dur ing the harvest of major foods, e.g., acorn or pinon in October and November, a large part of a com munity's population would settle for several weeks in areas to collect acorns, hunt game animals, and collect whatever else was locally available. Each community area contained many named places associated with food products, raw materi als, water resources, historical events, or sacred beings, along with connecting trails. Each area or place within a community's domain was owned by an individual, a family, the chief, or the com munity as a whole. Trails, temporary campsites, hunting sites, areas for rabbit or deer drives, quarry sites, and areas for ceremonial use and gaming are examples of places owned by the community as a whole. Group economic activities were usually restricted to the particular areas owned by a community, and family gatherings were confined to family-owned areas. Only with the express permission of others could economic use be made of areas within terri tory other than one's own. Many inland groups (for example, Luiseno and Kumeyaay) also had fishing and gathering sites on the coast that they visited annually when tides were low or when inland foods were scarce between January and March. Journeys to these areas required that the travelers have permission to pass through the ter ritory of another group.24 FALL 1992 311</page><page sequence="11">^Li^V^_U_W*^__: J_^__f_WI_%_w^i_^M__^^L^_tr 312 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="12">'^\*__ii__i_H_^ ^ '^^^wBBBbBI^^^^^^^M: wiilt- ^^^^^^B^^KBBSB^BBmm^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l :--5 ^#l^^^^|i^^WIPP"HB_H-_-^P' T*BP^'' : __________________B^____B^_____sBp_B_F_____Bfl_i_ """" *_*. ?**. ^'--~*']i3_i___________Pi__F _^:______________P^____i___________________HP^^_t _ ^?*Jaj|^^^''S|?Hr^jk^:'*^S-"?? ?. - tK~~T **'''-"r* ' ' ^__H___iB_BBB__fl__B_l_H _PlB__l ^^ftp^^^^^^^Et^^^^^, Housing Architectural types varied throughout the state according to function, aesthetic choice, and raw materials. They ranged from permanent, carefully constructed buildings occupied for a lifetime or more, to the most temporary type of structures, such as brush shelters or caves fronted with rocks, used only on occasion. A common house type was a round shelter with a dome and a withe-tied pole framework thatched with brush and covered with grass and earth, fern, carrizo, or tule mats. These dome-shaped houses had one or two entrances, placed to avoid wind, which could be covered for privacy. People in northwest California built square or rectangular houses of redwood planks. Some groups excavated a floor one foot or more below the ground level for a living surface and used the ledge around the periphery for storage. Inside such a house might be sleeping pallets, tools, and equip ment stored against the walls or hung on the sides. House floors were covered with woven mats, rab bit skin robes, or skins of deer, antelope, or moun tain sheep. Among groups such as the Gabrielino, Hupa, Yurok, and Maidu, spacious multi-family shelters, up to sixty feet in diameter and capable of holding fifty people, were constructed. Most homes, however, were occupied by just a husband and wife (or wives), their unmarried children, sometimes the man's parents, and occasionally a widowed aunt, uncle, or grandparent. Large community-used structures (ceremonial houses) served as the religio-political centers of a group or groups. These were often large enough to hold audiences of three hundred or more people and had areas for the storage of ritual regalia and often a kitchen and dining area for participants. They were sometimes adjoined by a fenced cere monial enclosure, in which many significant dances and rituals were performed and alongside of which participants and observers could sit. Ramada-\ike brush shelters were also used for some of these ceremonial grounds. Other village structures included sweathouses and granaries for storing large amounts of food such as acorns and mesquite beans. Sweathouses FALL 1992 313</page><page sequence="13">served as clubhouses or meeting places for adult males. These buildings were usually large, circu lar, semi-subterranean earth-covered structures supported by willow pole frames and thatching and having only one opening. Occasionally, how ever, sweathouses were smaller, just large enough for several people. A fire was built in the center of the sweathouse, where men, and sometimes women and children, would gather to cleanse their bodies by sweating. Sweathouses were often located near streams, so that following the sweat, everyone could take a dip in the nearby water. Sweats were taken for both medicinal and religious reasons, as well as before a hunt to eliminate human odors that game might smell. This activity is still practiced today by many California Indian peo ples, most especially for religious purposes, such as acquiring spiritual healing.25 Clothing and Adornment Because of the generally benign California cli mate, elaborate clothing for warmth and protec tion from the elements was usually not required. Wardrobes were decorative as well as protective, indicating one's personal taste, rank, wealth, or group membership. In winter, extra clothing pro vided protection against rain and cold. For exam ple, robes made of woven animal skins including rabbit, deer, and otter, or bird skins with feathers were worn. Men often wore no clothing or only loin clothes made of hide for everyday wear. They wore waist cords for carrying objects. During inclement weather men sometimes wore jackets, short trousers, otter skin robes, and buckskin shirts. Women wore knee length skirts made of various materials, like grasses, mesquite bark, deer or otter skins, tules, and the inner bark of willow. They also wore round basketry caps, often beautifully decorated. These protected their heads from the tumplines that supported their carrying nets. Women also wore two-piece or single-piece aprons. Children often went naked. Ritual costumes worn during dances by chiefs, shamans, and other ritualists were colorful and elaborately constructed from the plumage of birds such as the eagle, hawk, crow, owl, woodpecker, and hummingbird, the fur of the coyote, fox, and bear, as well as from shells, bones, beads and Wm___W__m____^_^_^_^_W_^t J^Mi M' V_________l ^^_^_^_^_I___B_____H RHESHHF^ ____HT' f ' H.^m ^ ^B !--;sL4g^^ffi^^MBlMr __fiM ?__^_^_mi $__^__^__^_L ^BII-^__^__^__HI-H_ PF wf^^i__Ki*S5.. &gt; ;'--t-i ^BTJiHii | __^_^_^_K C?V "l^^^^^^E?-* ' * - ' ' ^-"V-^ &gt; Hupa woman in shell apron, as photographed near the Klamath River in the early 1900s.

These often elaborate costumes included feather headdresses, feathered capes, skirts, hats, necklaces, and earrings. Personal ornaments were made of bone, leather, clay, stone, many different kinds of shell, espe cially abalone, olivella and clam, claws, and semi precious gemstones. Necklaces of beads or pendants were crafted from these materials, as well as from mica sheets and steatite. Bracelets and anklets were fashioned of human hair and shell. Men wore ear and nose ornaments of cane or bone, sometimes with beads attached. Elaborate body painting was also used by men and women to enhance costuming for ceremonial purposes and ordinary dress.

People painted and otherwise costumed and dec orated themselves to represent various supernatu ral beings, demigods, and culture heroes of their sacred past. Tattooing, using thorns or flint slivers as the agent and vegetable charcoal as the dye, was a common practice. Before puberty, many girls were tattooed on their foreheads and chins; while adult women had tattoos covering areas from their eyes down to their breasts. Women used tat tooing and facial coloring as beauty marks and identity group markers. Some men, too, tattooed their foreheads with various designs including vertical or horizontal lines.26 Aesthetics and Craftsmanship For California Indians, as for most peoples, to create beauty was a way to honor the supernatu rals and to increase the chances of receiving their blessings. Consequently, objects for everyday use, as well as objects for religious use, were shaped, decorated, and attended to with great care. Those who had extraordinary skill in such matters were honored and were well-rewarded economically and socially, both for their talent (power) and art, whether in the manufacture of goods or the crea tion of poetry, music, or dance. Such skills were considered gifts from the spiritual beings whose services were essential for a successful life. California Indians are as world-renowned for the artistry of their basketry as any culture in the world. In this art form, it is especially evident how a practical thing can become an object of beauty. Both designs and weaving styles signaled varying ethnicity and illustrated individual talents, cosmological and philosophical assumptions, and patterns of innovation and continuity. Baskets served both practical and ritual purposes. Basket type, shape, and size varied according to the pur pose for which it would be used. Coiled and twined baskets, for example, were used in food gathering, preparation, serving, and storage; shallow trays, for sifting and parching; large baskets, for gather ing; and large, loosely-woven containers made of willow, palm leaves, mesquite branches, and other plants were invaluable for gathering and storing large amounts of food.

Indians also produced elaborate rock paintings and rock engravings. Incising or pecking designs into rock was practiced in various parts of California, and multi-colored rock paintings are widespread, reaching their most elaborate development among the Chumash of the Santa Barbara Channel and inland areas. These petroglyph designs were not only associated with individual and group rituals, life crises, hunting and gathering activities, and solstice ceremonies, but also served as simple trail markers, boundary markers, and indicators of food or water.27 [Left] Yokuts basket weaver, Tule River Res ervation, near Porterville, ca. late nineteenth century.

Each local culture developed its own unique view. These literary achievements com pare with the Veddar of India, Gilgamesh, Beowulf, and other great epics. There were also thousands of songs with accom panying narratives, tales of victory, recollections of recent events or daily activities, and airs of love. The songs themselves were usually short but could, in narrative form, require several days to relate. Singing, it seems, was associated with every activ ity from the secular (manufacturing, hunting, and food processing) to the religious. It has been said by Indian elders that "one could always hear sing ing." Children were taught by it; the gods pleased with it; and lovers entranced with it. Singing was often accompanied by flutes, rasps, clappers, rat tles created from tortoise shell, gourd, or deer hoof, whistles, drums, and bullroarers. The choreography of native California varied too. Each culture area developed a characteristic dance style and aesthetic, enhanced for maximum effect with costumes and body painting reflecting the cosmological assumptions of that group. Feath ered beings represented creator gods; dancers were outfitted with eagles, symbolizing both the powers of the upper world and the soul of the spiritual being. (Eagle lived in the secular and sacred worlds simultaneously in order to bring life and continu ity to humans.) Each culture enjoyed its own unique expressions of such dance forms. These variations validated and demonstrated the special ethnicity and philosophy of each group, as different one from another as were their languages.28 Social Organization Each of the cultures (which anthropologist A. L. Kroeber called non-political, ethnic nationalities, likening them to European cultures of the recent past) shared linguistic, social, and cultural tradi tions distinct from those of other groups. They did not as a rule maintain centralized governmen tal structures, but instead each group comprised independent, territorial, political units not unlike fiefdoms of sixteenth-century Europe. Kroeber referred to these small nations as "tribelets." For example, the Porno recognized seven of these groups within their non-political, ethnic national ity, each one linguistically and culturally distin guishable from the others.29 Within the area occupied by each of these small nations, there was considerable ecological variation. Thus, tribelet populations ranged from several hun dred to several thousand people, depending on the richness of the locally available resources. Territo rial size ranged from fifty to one thousand or more square miles. These territories were closely held and vigorously guarded against intrusion by others. In south-central and southern California, sev eral lineages with communities based on patrilin eal descent were usually politically aligned in a clan. The clan then would be a small nation or tribelet. Members of the group were all considered to be related to one another. A principal chief was chosen from the principal or chiefly lineage, and major political, ritual, religious, and economic events would be held or articulated from that cen tral source. This principal chief, or chiefs, would reside with the tribelet. In north-central and northern California, on the other hand, these small nations were composed of peoples related to one another bilaterally. That is, people were more equally related to kin from both sides of the family, rather than only one side, as was the case in the rest of native California. This allowed for greater flexibility in group membership. Occasionally, small nations would confederate into larger units, and often were members of one or more "enmity-amity" or trade alliances. These alliances, which had recognizable boundaries, crossed several political, linguistic, and cultural lines. For example, the peoples of southern Cali fornia (Gabrielino, Cahuilla, Halchidoma) had sev eral such alliances, joining peoples from the Pacific Ocean to the Colorado River. Among some groups, several communities were allied under the leadership of a single chief. For example, among the Gabrielino at San Pedro, the largest village? Usa Na ("place of the skies")?was the political center for a cluster of other communi ties located nearby, and its chief was the political leader for these associated communities. The Porno, Yokuts, and Chumash also developed these exten sive political units, while the Mohave and Yuma peoples living along the Colorado River developed FALL 1992 317</page><page sequence="17">_r*__l__B_l-__(_9___-_i_l?_^^ '&lt;**v r^" -v' "^wSlPf^^ _v_3n!__B___llBB_B--^ . _^^_H__H___k_5_^_HI_______HH___^_________________________H_ ;^!*___aB_Srr' ' ^os. :N l-^___P.S__H____cH_____H?_H_i_fl____________________________ ^8_P*^_? v^1^ F5%jg^BBwBB_l__^_______ Interior of a temescal (sweathouse), desert tribes, early nineteenth century.

There, political unity was man aged by a central authority system representing all peoples in the culture. The chief, usually a man, was a political-economic administrator, and often a priest and adjudicator as well. The chief's authority over the people varied from general admonitions to specific directions for particular tasks, such as determining whether food was available and administrating its collection. Thus, the chief managed and redistributed much of the economic resources of the community. Dona tions from members of the community were main tained by this central authority and distributed to meet the emergency needs of individuals or the community's needs, such as events including ritu als or trade feasts when large numbers of guests from other groups might visit. The chief was often also a high priest and care taker of the sacred objects, in charge of scheduling sacred events. Power and high status were thus "crystallized" in the chief's position. The posses sion of sacred materials legitimized the secular authority of the chief and symbolized the link between the sacred past and the present. It was a material, symbolic representation of the people's sacred charter, the primary embodiment and focus of spiritual "power," and the charter of the theo cratic system. A chief's most important duties were to admin ister community solidarity and welfare and to act as the guardian of the sacred. In the former sphere of action, the chief arbitrated disputes, supervised tax collection in the form of "gifts" from the people (used principally for consumption by guests at cer emonies), led or administered war parties, directed intergroup activities, lectured people on proper behavior, advised about such matters as marriage, divorce, and family differences, appointed leaders for various group activities, concluded peace trea ties, and acted as the "model" person. The political leader, or chief, generally inherited his position, a custom that provided political sta bility within the group. Succession to this office was through the male side, a chief's eldest son assuming the office subject to community approval. If there were no satisfactory male candidates, a 318 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="18">woman, usually a sister or daughter of the previ ous chief, was appointed. Although the chief was the major decision-maker and the final authority, he engaged the aid of a council of other important persons, such as heads of extended families, shamans, and assistant chiefs to assist him and to validate his decisions. To help in these activities, the chief had an advisory coun cil likely to consist of an announcer, a treasurer, a general assistant who often delivered moral lec tures to the people, and messengers (persons with excellent memories, especially trained and kept until they "wore out"). These persons were often also ranking members of the religious hierarchy. As a rule, highly ranked people were conspicu ously different from others. They dressed more elaborately and with great displays of symbols of office, had access to sacred powers and often to greater economic resources, and were treated, accordingly, with great honor. Families of chiefs and shamans formed a superstratum of wealthy elites who cut across political boundaries. There were at least three hierarchically-ordered social classes, designated by modern scholars as the elite, the middle class, or those from fairly well-to-do and long-established lineages or fami lies, and the third class, comprising all others engaged in ordinary socio-economic pursuits. In some groups, there existed an underclass and "outlaw" groups as well.30 Marriage Marriage between and within groups, while a modestly celebrated arrangement, was a formal, as well as necessary and honored, institution. Mar riage established a long-standing social contract between families that was so strong that divorce was often difficult. Families exchanged goods at the time of the marriage, with the bulk of goods coming from the husband's side. When a child was born, a long-term economic and social alliance between the two families was established, charac terized by frequent reciprocal exchange of gifts of food and treasure goods. Marriage was thus also an instrument of ecology and economics. Through it, reciprocally useful alliances were arranged between groups living in differing ecological niches. Consequently, valuable materials were readily exchanged. These alliances sometimes became springboards for territorial expansion, especially following warfare and truces. Spouses were usually selected by the parents, often from members of families of equal rank. Usually marriage occurred within one culture, but some crossed cultural boundaries. For example, the Luiseno, Cahuilla, Gabrielino, and Kumeyaay intermarried, as did the Hupa, Yurok, Karuk, and Tolowa. In other groups where communities were not lineage-based corporate groups, marriage partners could be available within one's own com munity. Close kin?first and second cousins? were not acceptable as marriage partners. How ever, third cousins or more distant cousins were eligible, depending on the group. Among some groups, a person was required to select a spouse at least five generations removed. An ideal husband was attentive, responsible to his kin obligations, and skilled in economic pursuit or religious knowledge. A young bride was expected to be hard-working, to get along well with her in-laws, to produce food efficiently, and to bear children. Especially among lineally-based groups, the wife resided with the husband's family and was taught the ways of the husband's group by her mother-in-law. Men often had more than one wife. This was particularly true of chiefs and shamans because of the heavy social responsibilities required of their offices and because political ties between groups could thereby be established. Divorce was possible, but not easy. If, during the course of married life, a husband ill-used his wife, she could complain to her family. In such an instance, bridal gifts provided by the husband's family were often returned, and the woman was then free to return to her own home. On the other hand, if a wife were barren or unruly, her husband could send her home, and his family's "gifts" would have to be returned. In the case of a wife's infidelity, the husband could punish her or, in some cases, claim the wife of his wife's lover.31 Wars and Feuds Among some groups, inter-village conflicts were frequent and intense. In one documented instance, for example, coastal Gabrielino used military means to prevent some inland Gabrielino from reaching FALL 1992 319</page><page sequence="19">the sea for fishing and trading purposes. Reports from ethnographic and historic resources that such war was more than a defensive or rare occurrence is supported by the widespread existence of reed armor, war clubs, swords, and large, heavy bows used for warfare. While these "wars" were not lengthy, they could be deadly. They often involved several villages, and could, on occasion, be moti vated by expansionist goals, particularly the sei zure of valuable lands or resources, resulting in the near or total annihilation of other groups. Villages allied through marriage ties and eco nomic and religious bonds usually actively sup ported one another in armed conflict. Furthermore, it was not uncommon for a group planning a "war" to send ceremonial gifts to villages with which it did not have close ties, in hopes of either securing an alliance of mutual help or at least of ensuring the villages' neutrality. Armed conflict arose for a number of reasons, including failure of a chief to return a gift during a ceremony (that is, breaking the economic reci procity system), abduction of women, trespassing, poaching, competition over rare resources, or sor cery. (It was a common assumption that neighboring groups might use supernatural powers for harm.) When conflict was anticipated, officials called a war council at which all potentially involved villages discussed the pros and cons of going to war. A decision to go to war was not made lightly, since warfare involved not only warriors, but also old men, women, and even children. It endangered the group as a whole and its international eco nomic and political arrangements. If war was approved, a war "chief" led the war party, followed in order by able-bodied warriors, old men, women, and then the children, the last two groups carrying food and supplies. More common than warfare were feuds, which could result in highly-stylized conflicts. Feuds were quickly resolved upon sufficient injury, although they might pass from father to son for many gener ations. As often as not, inter-group enmities and grievances were vented through ritualized "song fights" lasting as long as eight days. These songs were often insulting and sometimes sung in the vilest language possible, including, in the case of southern California groups, stomping and tram pling the ground to symbolize the subjugation of the opponent.32 .^ SIM ^^^_^_^^i^_^_B^^f^_^_^_^_^_^B^^^^_^_^_^_^_^_K_^^^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_l L?&gt; N.~-?-?. __^Swfe- ^ ...ySs^gr *.-., ^--^^.^'y^^Bgfc- ^yBP^B^iwiilllBJ..^WH__ Rafael Solares, a Chumash shaman from the area of Mission Santa Ines, in traditional costume, demon strating use of the bow and arrow, 1878.

Trade and Commerce Major trade routes connected many tribes in northern, eastern, and western California with tribes in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Baja Cali fornia. For example, tribes living along the coast (such as the Chumash, Gabrielino, Luiseno, and Kumeyaay) were connected by trails or routes, including the Cocomaricopa and Yuma trails, with groups in Arizona. Other trails connected groups north and south. Long-distance commerce along these trade routes was extensive, providing a means whereby luxury items could be exchanged between tribes. The traders themselves enjoyed high rank and professional, diplomatic status. 320 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="20">Intra- and inter-group exchange was brisk and common, with people, goods, and ideas flowing in many directions and over long distances. From the inland people, the coastal peoples obtained acorns, seeds, obsidian, and deerskins in exchange for shell beads, dried fish, sea otter pelts, shells, and possibly salt. Steatite, available in great quan tities on Santa Catalina Island, was traded in rough or finished form to groups such as the Chumash, Yokuts, Kumeyaay, and Luiseno, and via the Chu mash to the distant Tubatulabal. Through Cahuilla, Chemehuevi, and Mohave middlemen located in interior southern California, groups in southern California and the Southwest engaged in a series of reciprocal exchanges, regu larized by the establishment of trading partner ships, perhaps as early as A.D. 600-800. Trading was probably barter type, but olivella beads and clam shell beads were considered legal tender throughout most of California and were also used to transact business. Knotted cords and carved wooden counters were used as mnemonic devices for recalling figures and quantities and intricacies of past or pending transactions.33 California Indians Today California Indian peoples have tended to be rural peoples residing mainly on reservations or rancherias or in the local communities near where they are members. Most still consider the tradi tional territories of their ancestors, as well as their reservation or rancherias, as "homeland," a place to which they and their descendants will always return, as they have in recent years in greater and greater numbers. It is a sacred and historic space, a physical reminder of one's philosophical and his toric roots, a place where traditional ways are understood and welcome. It is the preferred place to be, the place where kinfolks and old friends live, the place where one's traditional religious ways are available. Many native Californians may live away from their lands for the better part of a lifetime and yet come back frequently or finally to a way of life compatible with their cultural ideals and with close involvement with their family and friends. This pattern has contributed, in part, to cultural persist ence, since those who return may return with expectations of what was remembered when they left. There is, however, a long-established pattern of individuals moving, when necessary, to urban areas to receive an education or find employment. Individuals come and go, depending upon eco nomic conditions; some may live only seasonally on the reservations. People usually move because the areas where reservations have been placed are economically depressed. They move not only to find employment, but also to arrange for schooling for their children and to find the amenities of life that are often totally lacking in more remote areas. In many areas public schools are located nearby; in more isolated locations, however, students must be bused to school. As industries move closer to reservations and urban areas expand, people are more likely to find year-round work at or near home. Consequently, the permanent populations of reservations are expanding, including greater numbers of young people with children. In more remote areas, how ever, the economic situation remains bleak. People find it difficult, sometimes impossible, even to subsist on lands that once more than adequately maintained their parents and grandparents, who could work in local industries, such as agriculture, ranching, and timber harvesting. The problem of a dwindling water supply on reservation lands is a serious one, too. Seventy-five years ago rural Indian peoples could still move easily and maintain a living by farming, stock raising, and hunting and gathering. Today, the giant urban areas have acquired the water rights and siphoned off much of the water, leaving many mountain valleys dry and unsuitable for agricul ture and other activities. Tourism and reservation gambling (bingo casinos) have provided some new sources of income. According to California state government sources, there are approximately eighty Indian settlements defined as either reservation or rancheria, each with a population varying from a few people to several hundred. Within each, there may be tribal lands (which belong in common to all the members), allotted lands (which are owned by individuals or collections of individuals through inheritance, but are held in trust by the federal government), and assigned lands (which are owned by the reserva tion as a group, but assigned to the specific use of certain individuals). FALL 1992 321</page><page sequence="21">Cahuilla farmers (ca. 1900) cultivating land near Indio allotted them by the United States government. After the gold-rush period, during which many Indians lost their lives to disease and violence at the hands of their American conquerors, remnants of native peoples survived in remote areas of the state, on small reservations or the lands of others. They managed to subsist by blending agriculture with traditional hunting and gathering. Generally excluded from public schools and most avenues of employment and allowed to occupy only arid and infertile land, most Indians were forced to live in dire poverty well into the twentieth century. Courtesy Huntington Library. 322 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="22">The United States government withdrew most federal responsibility for native Californians in 1955 under Public Law 280.34 Each reservation or rancheria now elects a body of officials, known variously as a business-committee or tribal council. These officials represent the group and act as a liaison between the group and outsiders such as the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; business corporations desiring the purchase or lease of reservation lands; state, county, and other federal agencies; public utilities concerned with obtaining rights-of-way across lands; and any individual or group seeking a rela tionship with the tribal group. With the advice and consent of the people, the council acts to deter mine the use made of tribally-owned assets, and as a receiving agent for grants from various economic development and assistance organizations of the government. It is especially active in economic plan ning, delivery of health care, and planning social and educational development programs for the future protection of the group's assets. For the most part, California Indians have adopted many of the ways of the European world. In employment, clothing, housing, transportation, education, medical and social services, and often religion, they are sometimes not significantly dis tinguishable from other peoples residing in Cali fornia. In many other ways, however, traditional native Californian culture, values, art, dance, music, psychology, and the attachment to tradi tional lands contribute to the rich cultural fabric of the state. Wherever there are Indian populations, one still finds ceremonial houses, rituals, celebra tions of traditional and modern Indian life, the continued use and manufacture of ritual materials, and the use of native foods and medicine. Many traditional crafts, dance, music, and other arts are being maintained. Much of the past is preserved, and a vigorous and creative "school" of California Indian art has emerged. Indian languages, though spoken less and less as first languages, are being maintained and revived among many groups. Linguists have been working very actively with California Indians to this end. On some reservations there are cultural centers and museums that not only preserve the culture and language, but also collect and publish material about the group. On other reservations and in some local school districts, classes in native languages and culture are offered to both children and adults. Several organizations, such as the California Indian Education Association, American Indian Histori cal Society, Hupa Cultural Center, and Malki Museum, have aggressively examined, criticized, and provided to teachers new teaching materials dealing with Indian culture and history. In contrast to reservation-based groups, many California Indian groups never received federal acknowledgment. These groups, therefore, have no land-base or special relationship with the fed eral government. Now, over thirty previously unrecognized groups, such as the Ohlone of the San Francisco Bay Area, are actively engaged in requesting such recognition. These groups have contributed a new dynamic thrust to the visibility of Indian cultures. In the major population centers of California, from San Francisco and Oakland south to San Diego, different forms of Native American cultural development are under way as California Indians and others throughout the United States establish residence in major urban areas. Bringing with them diverse tribal and cultural backgrounds, they con tribute to a new cultural diversity and to an emerg ing pan-Indian consciousness and institutional structure.35 !_____ See notes beginning on page 446.
