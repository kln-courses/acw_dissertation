<plain_text><page sequence="1">London Recent American painting At the newly opened London gallery of Emily Tsingou, the show of Karen Kil- imnik's work (closed 2nd May), took the viewer into the now familiar territory of thrift-store frivolity-cum-angst occupied by many a young American's painting over the last decade. In the first space of the gallery pictures were propped amidst fake snow and half-hearted Christmas decorations, reminiscent of a depressing window display in a small-town newsagent. There were for- lorn, deliberately shabby and inept paint- ings: mandarin ducks, a Russian icon, a still life, a portrait of the ubiquitous film star Leonardo Di Caprio. These were hung with a series of Polaroid snapshots featuring someone walking her dog in the snow. The lower gallery offered Kilimnik's solipsistic trademark drawings of cartoon characters, jaded pop stars, models and Hollywood floozies, mixed with hand-written snippets of tabloid headlines and advertising copy. Kilimnik's works appear arrested in a perpetual adolescence, unable to relate to anything, yet able to entertain everything once it is given a protective ironic gloss that prevents any earnest emotional response, and indeed any vigorous intellectual engagement. At its best, irony can offer new ways of describing the world, breaking down the rigidity of formulaic or proscrip- tive thinking. In the hands of artists such as Kilimnik it appears increasingly worn out. If the work aims to engage and then criticise the notion of the artist as romantic outsider, it misses the mark. Its references are too idly unimaginative and its execution too lame and pinched to encourage interpretation. It may be that there is something lost in trans- lation, this being work by an American artist who struggles to keep up to speed with the English capacity for voraciously con- suming and mutating any form of popular culture in the most subtle ways. If an artist's work is going to engage with the very ephemerality of contemporary life, it needs to be extremely perceptive to create any- thing of substance and not itself become a fashion victim. 53.

Kilimnik's concern with kitsch and fame is unable to open up occluded aspects of reality or allow us to incorporate her sub- ject matter, reinvented, into our lives. She sets the stakes so low, not least in terms of the formal make up of her images. Fellow American Monique Prieto pre- sented a far more promising set of concerns in her pristine abstract paintings at Robert Prime (closed 9th May). She explores the seductive beauty of tautly stretched raw canvas, soaking paint into the tooth of these surfaces like a stain (Fig.53). Her abstract forms are indexed to the physical world of figures and natural objects, and one cannot avoid associations of women's billowing dresses, processions of people and the nar- rative relationships between them. This anthropomorphism eschews the impossible metaphysical ambitions that this type of painting traditionally harbours, allowing a dialectical relationship between form and content: the sensate world we occupy and the self-contained world of the painting. This pragmatic acceptance of the limitations of painting actually frees the work up to embrace a myriad of possibili- ties. Bulbous blobs of colour and wavering lines intimately press up against one anoth- er, as if for comfort, while respecting a con- tained tension at the edges of the canvas. There is no underpainting or trace of draw- ing on these canvases as the artist pre- designs the images on a computer. The results have a freshness and sense of space that avoids triteness and lodges firmly in the memory. One possible reservation might concern the seemingly 'safe' use of colour. Prieto's otherwise welcome self control results in a range of tones that are tasteful and unobtrusive, and, since she admirably avoids the parodic, the works can appear in this respect to not rise to the serious aesthet- ic challenges they set themselves. Never- theless, Prieto has already produced paint- ings of great sensitivity, intelligence and humour. They conducted fruitful conversa- tions between themselves in this elegantly installed show. Prieto's realisation is that the future of painting (or for that matter any art form) rests on a mining of tradition combined with a capacity for imaginative forward thinking and experimentation. Such a dia- logue with the tradition - a constant unfold- ing of the past into the present - inevitably structures our anticipation of meaning in art. However, this unity of tradition cannot be insisted upon in a dogmatic way: it is always open to the reconstructive capacities of artists. Similar insights seem embodied in Jessica Stockholder's work in Young Ameri- cans Hat the Saatchi Gallery (to 7thJuly)1 - an exhibition indicatively well stocked with examples of the present painting 'revival'. Stockholder, though characteris- ing her practice as painting, rails against the flatness of painting and its confinement within four edges of a canvas. Her works assert themselves in space with a vivid use of colour and an imaginative array of materi- als. Bowtied in the middle (Fig.54) is the single most impressive piece in the show. It com- prises a knobbled violet carpet encrusted with lime green and yellow paint, suspend- ed over a makeshift wooden frame and caressed by tendrils of wool and ribbon attached to two electric fans. Stretched red nylon ropes with yellow stitching, blue elec- tric lights, adjacent yellow walls, a painted green post, two plant-holders, one terracot- ta and one plastic, and a collection of plastic pears and real oranges, all additionally engage the eye. Strapped to the post, with vivid blue harnesses, are a set of floral sofa cushions liberally daubed with oil paint. Stockholder's adroit attention to detail maximises visual stimulation, creating con- vincing and enigmatic formal relationships between the most mundane ephemeral materials. Her other works here used tennis balls bound in chicken wire, bundles of clothes in green plastic netting, balls of wool, a plastic pond and a garden sun umbrella, pushing at the boundaries of painting and sculpture, creating enthralling hybrids. Colour, form, material, light and composition are all accorded a powerfully intelligent attention, and this lifts the work (despite its often uneasy occupation of the cavernous gallery) far above much else in this show. In David Salle's work by contrast, which has not visibly developed since the early 80s, the overwhelming sense of insignificance that was once perhaps what these paintings were about, has now come to condition what they are. The examples featured here again play with the exhausted tactics of pas- tiche and kitsch. The many empty speech bubbles which are part of their tediously cryptic iconography seem to emblematise the works' lack of anything to say. They are uninvolving; and photographic silkscreen inserts read as an attempt to add some point of interest to, yet at the same time to render intentional, the arbitrary irresolution of the compositions. Insipid colour superimposed over overblown doodles generates only dis- tant and random associations that are hard to empathise with. The consciously second- hand graphic tricks and stock tropes (glibly reworked from Surrealism, Pop and maga- zine spreads) with which the artist first beguiled his audience have now become doubly clich6-ed. Glossed again and again in his own paintings, they seem re-emptied of the unexpected meanings with which he momentarily appeared to have filled them. Another artist of a slightly more estab- lished generation included in the Saatchi selection was Terry Winters, though unfor- tunately he was represented only by two paintings. The first, Graphic primitives 1, is perhaps, ultimately, a failure. Its frenetic brushmarks appear squashed and desper- ately constrained by an inappropriately sized canvas that makes it hard to look at for any length of time. However, the second painting, Developmental surface model, pursuing similar concerns, achieves a paradoxical elegance. A frenzy ofpainterly lines create a vortex-like web that sucks the viewer in. Fluid paint records the nervy trace of Win- ters's brush, describing enmeshed pulsating spaces that resist containment. It would have been interesting to see more of Win- ters's paintings in relation to Stockholder's work as they both seem to be restlessly extending and questioning their practice before our eyes. To return to newer figures on the Ameri- can scene, the acclaimed Carroll Dunham, who provided the largest painting in the show, appears to acknowledge his immedi- ate American predecessors. He seems to offer, shamelessly, a poor man's Keith Har- ing or Jean-Michel Basquiat, with nods to late Guston and George Herriman's Krazy Kat cartoon. His comic-strip or graffiti-like characters stab, flagellate, shoot and squirt one another, teeth gritted and penises gripped. Yet these figure's do not have the verve or humour of genuine street graffiti, nor of outsider art, or CoBrA or Parisian post-War precursors such as Dubuffet, Chaisac or Constant. One is left uncertain as to whether an anarchic energy is really intended, or - yet again - merely alluded to in a spirit of desultory parody. Certainly the liquid substance of paint that Dun- ham works with seems a tolerated contin- gency rather than a positive factor in the 54. Bowtied in the middle (#273), by Jessica Stockholder. 1996.

Two New York artists, finally, who made a first rather tantalising appearance in Lon- don this Spring, were Arturo Herrera and Kara Walker, at Stephen Friedman (to 30th May). Herrera presented a large wall painting in the front gallery, perfunctorily executed as if in a day-dream, dumpy, ugly, unarresting - a grey blob on a pale orange ground, with maroon 'shadow', white 'high- light' and two dark linear 'handles'. On the floor he placed two loosely-coiled, hose- long erasers, appearing like red and green liquorice. In a corridor space was a sepia- toned photograph of shafts of light pene- trating woods around a pond. Two enigmatic cut-out works, one of blue felt and one of orange paper, occupied the rear gallery. There was a vague sense of a nag- ging puzzle, as when one is trying vainly to remember a person's name, but any desire to persevere in interpreting the works relied too heavily upon a belief in a standard language of dreams and associations that we can all successfully access. Kara Walker's black paper cut-outs are burlesque, folksy figures of white slave own- ers and black piccaninnies taken from Southern plantation iconography. They appear like cameos or stark shadow puppets creating disconcerting vignettes where power games, innuendo and cruelty per- vade the relations between characters (Fig.55). A black male figure seems to be playing croquet next to a naked girl in a large bonnet who lies back in a sexual posi- tion, smoking a pipe. A young black girl hoists a yelping white man up on her back as a matronly figure, holding a mallet, demands something from her. Escaping the scene is a small cherubic figure who whips himself causing visible lacerations on his back. One can only guess at what is occur- ring in this play of emotive material that dredges up nostalgia and anger over a grim aspect of American history that still has rel- evant repercussions. In the back gallery are two water-colours that appear to be a type of victim's fantasy. The first shows a black woman furiously jumping up and down in an effort to abort her baby, whose head has already become detached and lies on the ground. The second shows a black woman burying a white slave owner with a shovel. Walker's work needs more space than she is permitted in this gallery to expand on her multi-faceted historical and sexual fan- tasies: the viewer just begins to enter into these narratives before being prematurely cut short. Her work is certainly more suc- cessful than Herrera's in creating a strong, and often grotesque, visual language that requires a response. It shows that fantasy, history and nostalgia, and the way they are worked on in the unconscious, have tangi- ble, ongoing consequences.
