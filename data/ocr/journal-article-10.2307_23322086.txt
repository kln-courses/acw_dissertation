<plain_text><page sequence="1">Monika Fludernik How Natural Is "Unnatural Narratology"; or, What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology?1 When I used the term natural in Towards a "Natural" Narratology (1996), I tried to emphasize distinctly that this was a use of the term that was not to be contrasted with an opposite, the unnatural, dissociating myself from the moralistic, phallogocentric, heterosexual and generally conservative ideologies of the natural and their rejection, if not demonization, of the (unnatural, perverse) Other. To the extent that I needed to resort to dichotomy, I therefore employed the term non-natural as a, it seemed to me, less loaded contrary. Since Brian Richardson's study Unnatural Voices: Extreme Narration in Modern and Contemporary Fiction (2006), however, the term unnatural has seen a landslide of popularity among younger narratologists, especially the co authors of "Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology: Beyond Mimetic Models" (Alber et al.), and has even been integrated into the Literary Encyclopedia (Alber, "Unnatural Narratives"). Naturally, if one may phrase it like this, Alber et al. likewise stress that they do not take a moralistic, conservative stance, and that their "use of the term unnatural' is similar to the use of the term 'queer in queer studies" (Alber et al., "Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology," 132, fn 5). Monika Fludernik is Professor of English at the University of Freiburg in Germany. Her publications include The Fictions of Language and the Languages of Fiction (1993), Towards a 'Natural' Narratology (1996), and An Introduction to Narratology (2009).

NARRATIVE, Vol 20, No. 3 (October 2012) Copyright 2012 by The Ohio State University</page><page sequence="2">358 Monika Fludernik This paper is conceived as a critical response to Alber et al.'s "Unnatural Nar ratives, Unnatural Narratology." It will delve into the semantics of (un)naturalness before discussing the authors' main thesis that "narratives are also full of unnatural elements" and "defy, flaunt, mock, play, and experiment with some (or all) of these core assumptions about narrative" (114). In particular, it will engage with the ques tion of familiarity and unfamiliarity, or of identity and alterity, in narrative, and the relation of mimetic and non-mimetic features of storyworlds, discourses and narration(al act)s. To what extent does "Natural" Narratology share a dichotomous world view with Werner Wolf's anti-illusionism? Is there an anti-mimetic (dare I call it "unnatural"?) reductionism as well as a "mimetic reductionism" (115), which is the target of Alber et al.'s research project? Finally, I would like to address the important distinction between naturalization and conventionalization which the authors pro pose in the final paragraph of their fine essay It should be acknowledged at the outset that what this difference in opinion is about is how to approach the non- or anti-mimetic in narrative within a broad his torical perspective. Although Alber originally focused on postmodernist experiments (Alber, "'Moreness' or 'Lessness'"), claiming that Towards a "Natural" Narratology was unable to fully deal with all narratives, the position of Alber et al. ("Unnatu ral Narratives, Unnatural Narratology"), by contrast, emphasizes the highlighting of "unnaturalness" and therefore the limits of the mimetic across a wide range of texts, with postmodernist experimentalism only one of many areas of analysis. To this ex tent, Alber et al. are conducting research much in the spirit of Towards a "Natural" Narratology, which sought to find a model able to deal with a maximum number of narrative texts, especially including postmodernist metafictional literature which had previously been characterized in merely antimimetic negative terms (no plot, no character, no setting, etc.). As we shall see, the mimeticism which serves as a target for "unnatural" narratology is both that of the mimetic representation in texts and the mimetic philosophy of naturalization subtending Towards a "Natural" Narratol ogy and its cognitivist model. The critical thrust of "Unnatural" Narratology for this reason also affects the framework of cognitive approaches to narrative since, as I will illustrate below, the cognitive paradigm is ineluctably intertwined with the "natural" (though not necessarily with the mimetic). Binary Opposites and Conceptions of the Natural Contrasting the natural, or nature, with its opposite has been a favored pastime of philosophy and the history of ideas since their origins in Greek antiquity. Thus, one of the first treatments of the dichotomy comes from Antiphon (5th century BC), who contrasts nature (cpucnc;, physis) and the laws (vopoi, nomoi). According to Antiphon, nature is necessary, whereas the laws are imposed (Fragment 1; 160-61). In fact he goes on to call the laws "chains on nature" (Seo^ot xr|c¡ cpuaecoc;). Another way of see ing this dichotomy is in terms of Nature as a force outside human power in contrast to law, which is man-made. Theologically, nature turns into that which has been created by God, whereas its opposite occupies the territory allowed to man, in which he in</page><page sequence="3">What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology? 359 turn can exercise his creative faculties. The natural thus comes to stand in opposition to the artificial, the invasive (Man tampering with Nature), giving rise to judgments like Plato's condemnation of the pharmakon of writing: to speak is natural, to write is an adulteration of speech. Similar moralism can be encountered in our ecological age when it comes to biological food, home-grown vegetables, ecological beef and so on, which are positively contrasted with chemically contaminated, genetically engineered and generally adulterated foods. A second, equally moralistic line of argument runs from classical rhetoric through to the preface of the Lyrical Ballads, privileging sim plicity and common-sense plainness, which are seen as natural and forthright, over rhetorical elaboration, metaphorical ornamentation and stylistic artificiality (see, e.g., Chapter 2 in Todorov's Theories of the Symbol). Artificiality, conceived as the addi tion of aesthetic superfluity, as falsifying the truth of nakedness by alluring garments, has likewise had a career of considerable importance and of recurrent metaphorical significance. This prejudice against art extends also to behavior, as when the natural grace of the body is contrasted with the art of dancing, or the studied and contrived gestures of courtly etiquette. All of these dichotomies, as Derrida has so memorably reminded us, can be de constructed in numerous ways. In fact, nature is not natural in most European and North American contexts; what we call nature (in contrast to towns or human hab itats) has been transformed by the hand of man through tillage, forestation, river regulation, and, more recently, the impact of transportation and industrialization. The dichotomy between nature and civilization was also successfully inverted by the eighteenth-century discourse of primitivism and its hailing of the noble savage in contrast to the immorality and turpitude of civilized mankind. On the other hand, artificiality has found a champion with poets who claim that the ornaments of lan guage are intrinsic to the message and cannot be removed from the text without af fecting their meaning. It is also defended by those who believe in decorum and, like Burke, regard the protection of dress as a necessary complement for the "naked shiv ering nature" of man (74).2 Anti-ecologists claim that all our fruits and meats are no longer natural but already constitutively adulterated since they have evolved from a centuries-long process of grafting and human nurture. To see Nature and Man as two poles of a dichotomy moreover deliberately suppresses the similarities between these oppositional concepts. In so far as man (often contrasted with the animal kingdom) is not as nicely positioned between mammals and the lower orders of angels as the great Chain of Being would have it, but a hybrid, displaying significant similarities with animated nature (see Boehrer), a simple contrast of nature and civilization or nature and humanity makes sense only locally, but not globally. (Man may behave differently from animals as a result of linguistic and mechanical abilities, but shares instinctual aggressive reactions and the predatory inclination with [some] animals.) It is thus obvious that both the concept of nature and the concept of humanity in op position to nature are entirely unspecific, specious and contradictory in themselves; by contrasting them, one intensifies the fuzziness to a considerable extent. However, this is in fact an advantage for those employing such dichotomies in the service of ideology—the opposition can be made to mean a great many things without needing to be quite specific about the limits and boundaries of the terms.</page><page sequence="4">360 Monika Fludernik Given these philosophical and literary or cultural antecedents, one is advisedly cautious in employing the term natural. Towards a "Natural" Narratology was there fore quite explicit about deploying the term in relation to three previous uses which were innocent of the ideological commitments sketched above. The first of these was Labov's natural narrative3 to designate spontaneous con versational narrative which is "naturally occurring." By this term Labov does not nec essarily mean unelicited narratives of personal experience, since his famous mate rial of narratives was collected by asking African-American youths whether they had ever been in a serious fight. Analyzing the "simplest and most fundamental narra tive structures ... in direct connection with their originating functions" ("Narrative Analysis" 12) for oral versions of personal experiences, Labov and Waletzky define narrative "as one method of recapitulating past experience by matching a verbal se quence of clauses to the sequence of events which actually occurred" (21; see also Labov 359-60). A fully-formed natural narrative in the Labovian sense is constituted by six phases: an abstract, followed by an orientation, an evaluation section, a compli cating action/complication, a result or resolution, and a coda (Labov 363). From this it follows that "natural" contrasts with culturally transmitted narratives like fairytales or ghost stories and with written material. Moreover, one may want to see Labov's narra tives as factual in opposition to fictional storytelling. There also is a strong correlation between naturally occurring storytelling and first-person narrative, since what Labov is interested in is the prototype of narratives of personal experience (rather than nar ratives of vicarious experience or witness narratives—cp. Fludernik, Towards 57-58). Labov's concept of natural narrative is therefore one that involves the dichotomy of spontaneous production versus culturally monitored recall, but does not reify the opposition in terms of nature versus culture since, as a sociolinguist, he is interested precisely in the cultural ramifications of such storytelling, as the title of his study, Lan guage in the Inner City, already indicates. My second source of inspiration was Jonathan Culler's use of the term natural ization to describe the resolving of inconsistencies in a text within an interpretative framework, often by recourse to protagonists' motivations. The inconsistency, con tradiction or oddity is thus "made to look natural," explained away, aligned with a higher-level framework. Culler's remarks need to be correlated with Tamar Yacobi's excellent work on readers' interpretative strategies (Yacobi, "Fictional Reliability," "Narrative and Normative"), in which she has distinguished "a variety of reconciling and integrating measures" ("Fictional Reliability" 114) that can be subsumed under five "principles of resolution" (119). Thus, textual inconsistencies can be laid at the doorstep of the author, who apparently slipped up; responsibility can also be ascribed to the editor or other genetic factors of text production {genetic principle; 114); the apparent slip can moreover be read as a deliberate authorial strategy, meant to alert the reader to a narrator's unreliability (perspectival principle; 118-19), which also in cludes cases where the oddity is grounded in characters' psychology (insanity, na'ive té, moral failings), establishing a mimetic or motivational perspectivism. Yacobi also notes a generic principle, in which the genre frame explains departures from the ex pected norm, and afunctional principle, where the deviation has a clear purpose. The fantastic is accounted for by what she calls the existential principle (116-17). What</page><page sequence="5">What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology? 361 all of these strategies amount to is the attempt to impose a homogeneous semantic framework on the text, to standardize the interpretative effect, in other words, to mo tivate deviance from the norm or from current templates by explaining the difference as signifying additional information that enhances or deepens our understanding of the text. Since we have already alluded to the Russian Formalists and their notion of mo tivation, their treatment of oddity should also receive mention here. They explained the deviance from, say, stylistic norm by a hypermimetic reference to the "stoniness of the stone" (cp. Shklovsky 12). I am noting the parallel with Russian Formalism since, as the authors of "Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology" claim, they are interested in preserving and in highlighting oddity: "From our perspective, the unnatural is everywhere, and it is about time for narrative theory to embrace it" (131). In a footnote, they also link unnaturalness with Formalist deviation, noting that all unnatural features of narrative have a defamiliarizing effect but that "not all instances of defamiliarization involve what we call the unnatural" (132, fn 5). It therefore ap pears to be the case that "unnatural" narratologists desist from imposing a standard izing interpretation on the deviant strategy or feature of a text in order to foreground its strangeness as a raison d'etre in and by itself. However, as the examples in the essay show, even "unnatural" readers cannot resist interpretation, though their manner of interpretation differs from that of mimeticists since they tend to foreground the pro jection of alternative worlds (Coover's "The Babysitter") or metafictional policy (cp. "Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology" 129). At this point I am less concerned with the mimetic thrust of Cullers naturaliza tion model, however, than with its lack of implication with the ideology of the natural. Naturalization, ideologically speaking, is a type of rationalization (Eagleton 51-52) which claims that a particular social complex has its roots in nature, that it is therefore eternal, God-given and unassailable, that it provides one of the foundations of the society of which it is part. None of these ideological trappings can be discovered in Culler's term or its narratological repercussions. As for mimeticism being a "natural" or "naturalizing" ideology in its own right, this is a point to which I will return later in this essay. Let me turn to my third source of inspiration, cognitive linguistics in its Austrian manifestation of Natürlichkeitstheorie. Cognitive linguistics of this type (Dressler et al.) is based on prototype theory and emphasizes how our language operates in two roughly opposite ways—by enhancing efficiency and ease of apperception or com prehension, and by disrupting expectations through salient or marked elements that are unexpected and hence reorient or redirect attention, requiring listeners or read ers to resort to additional interpretative strategies. The affinity with Formalism is, again, striking. What is natural within cognitivist linguistics, however, again bears no resemblance at all to nature in the ideological sense. Naturalness is simply a term for the expected, the statistically most common, which is then assumed to mirror an inherent tendency of language. For instance, ease of articulation is assumed to be responsible for phonetic assimilation processes, just as the loss of endings can be re traced to their semantic superfluity in contexts where verb semantics is sufficient to clarify meaning. In such cases there will be a "natural" tendency to economize. (Other</page><page sequence="6">362 Monika Fludernik aspects of topology and cognitive linguistics may be more problematic, as when one assumes that the semantic changes from spatial to temporal to logical use of preposi tions are evidence of a prior focus in language on the body that inevitably makes all elaborated language metaphorical.4) In Towards a "Natural" Narratology I was basing my use of the term "natural"— always in quotation marks—on the three areas just summarized. My main effort in this context was to avoid an ideologically suspect use of the term natural. In terms of the narratological model I presented I was particularly interested in describing cogni tive prototypes (e.g., narrative situations) and how we familiarize originally strange patterns when they proliferate, beginning to notice their oddity less and less (as, e.g., with simultaneous narration or second-person narratives). I will return to the ques tion to what extent such popular oddities become merely conventionalized or also naturalized at the end of the essay. What I want to underline at this point is that the scenarios that I described were called non-natural rather than unnatural and that I made no claim that they had to be naturalized, only that they could be naturalized in the reading process. In particular, I argued that some particularly amimetic or non mimetic aspects might not be recuperable through a naturalizing reading strategy and remain resolutely resistant to a mimetically based aesthetics. Where Alber et al. differ from me is therefore in the fact that they want to rescue the non-natural and mimetically "deviant" from the colonization of mimeticism. Preserving the "unnatu ral" within the "natural" thus seems to correlate with a different habit of consumption. We all know that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. While I tend to concentrate on the overall taste, ignoring some of the ingredients, Alber et al. savour the tinge of spice that conflicts with the overall familiar blandness of the pudding. The Unnatural and Unnatural Narratology Let me now turn to a consideration of what exactly is unnatural in unnatural narra tology. The term itself, with its unfortunate associations of perversity, the denatured or deviant, actually has no such loaded meanings. In fact it is equivalent to a variety of meanings that include the fabulous, the magical, and the supernatural besides the logically or cognitively impossible. Richardson, in Unnatural Voices, describes the subject of his book as follows (oddly, he never once uses the term "unnatural" despite its prominence in the title of the study): Still more relevant to this study are the many odd, unusual, or impossible speakers found in contemporary works. These figures are also much more challenging to traditional narrative theory, which is typically based on the mimesis of actual speech situations. If a narrative is, as commonly averred, someone relating a set of events to someone else, then this entire way of looking at narrative has to be reconsidered in the light of the numerous ways innovative authors problematize each term of this formula, especially the first one. (5)</page><page sequence="7">What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology? 363 In fact, Richardson employs the term "non- and anti-mimetic" narration (2, 14) as well as the adjective "innovative" (5, 16) to characterize what must be his under standing of unnatural narrative. Richardson's definition basically covers all types of anti-mimetic strategies employed in narrative (including dramatic narratives); it can be assimilated to a characterization of "transgressions of the mimetic norm," though with the important qualification that his interest is in the inventiveness and display of non-mimetic options rather than in privileging the (uninteresting) familiar norm of the mimetic. In Alber et al. ("Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology") the category of the logically, cognitively, or humanly impossible is added to these descriptors. Logi cal impossibility touches, for instance, on the law of contradiction, as in the example of "The Babysitter," where several actions are juxtaposed that are incompatible (either Mr. Tucker goes home or he does not; either the baby is drowned in the bathtub or it survives; etc.). Cognitively impossible scenarios also include time moving backwards or branching out into two different temporalities (cp. Dannenberg), people being in several places at the same time, or violations of the law of gravity. One notes that in alternative worlds operating according to different laws of physics, such scenarios might be "mimetic" in the sense of representing what is the case in that particular world. Cognitively impossible scenarios are therefore closest to the supernatural, for which all things are possible (one thinks). Finally, the humanly impossible highlights scenarios in which characters or narrators are able to act in ways that transgress hu man limitations, either mentally or physically, or both. These anthropomorphic fic tional creatures can walk through walls, read other people's minds, speed up (or slow down) their aging, transform themselves into animals, and so on. Many of these feats are magical or supernatural features familiar to us from fairytales or oriental tales as well as from science fiction. In fact, the three categories overlap to a large extent: Is flying on carpets a personal ability of the magician, or is this a world in which carpets can be made to fly? Time travel may be a personal magical capacity (in a wizard in a fairytale or romance), or it may be a technical innovation in a science-fiction alterna tive world. One of the most important practical consequences of discovering the "unnatural" in the deceptively realist or familiar text is therefore this recuperation of the fabulous, magical, fantastic or supernatural. Since narratology was so strongly focused on the realist novel and therefore tended to neglect pre-eighteenth-century narratives, it has devoted comparatively little attention to the supernatural (except, as in Poe, when it is a supernatural explained through the insanity, na'iveté, or cultural backwardness of an unreliable mind in the grip of delusion). What "unnatural" narratology may set out to do is to characterize in more detail how the fantastic is woven through the texture of realism, and how the fabulous relies on the cognitive frames of realism to become interpretable. The "unnatural" in the conception presented by Alber et al. in "Unnatural Narra tives, Unnatural Narratology" therefore participates in two familiar discourses which have not shared much critical ground: the discourse of fable, romance, before-the novel narrative; and the discourse of postmodernist anti-illusionism, transgression, and metafiction. Wolf's key study on anti-illusionistic technique (Ästhetische Illusion;</page><page sequence="8">364 Monika Fludernik see also "Aesthetic Illusion") focused on anti-mimetic narrative strategies in fiction, among which precursors like Tristram Shandy obviously played an important role. By linking these insights (and those uncovered in Brian McHale's and Brian Rich ardson's work on postmodernism) with the tradition of the fantastic, "unnatural" narratology is performing a signal service to the narratological community whose importance cannot be overestimated. From this perspective, the proposal of an "unnatural" narratology is both timely and significant. In what follows I want to return to some questions raised above and deal with them in greater detail. These are the issue of rescuing the unnatural from naturalization; the deconstruction of literary fictionality on the background of analy ses of conversational narrative; the status of mimesis in the context of naturalization; and the contrasting of conventionalization with naturalization, particularly in the context of blending theory (or conceptual integration theory). Issues in (Non-)Natural Narratology One of the most appealing features of "unnatural" narratology is its avowed desire to preserve the oddity of the strange and illogical in otherwise realistic texts. Whereas some textual inconsistencies are often tidied over by explaining them as due to the mental disabilities or strangeness of a character (e.g., in the unreliability reading of Poes "Tell-Tale Heart"), "unnatural" narratology is supposed to highlight the trans gression of realist norms. Thus, in the case of the Poe story discussed in the article, Alber et al. argue with great aplomb that there is no "realistic" storytelling scenario in the tale since the narrator seems to be narrating both in the past and in the pres ent. Even more uncannily, the discourse of the narrator seems to be taken over by the beating heart, which rhythmically manifests itself in the narrator's gasps of speech. Whether what we are hearing is the heartbeat of the narrator, who is racked by his murderous delusions, or whether he did commit the murder and the buried heart is now taking over the I/eye of the narrator—in both cases something supernatural is going on. And this supernatural in familiar readings of the tale becomes background ed, indeed buried, through the identification of the narrator as a murderous lunatic whose narration is simply biased. The reading of Poe's "Tell-Tale Heart" in "Unnatu ral Narratives, Unnatural Narratology" is therefore the most successful one of those provided in the essay. The discussion of "The Babysitter," on the other hand, is more problematic. In a postmodernist analysis of the tale, one usually notes that the story juxtaposes numer ous incompatible story lines and—since these are not ascribable to a character's fan tasies—ends up with two strategies: either one posits that the text is the narrator's or the characters communal fantasy of everything that could happen if you leave your house and children in the care of a babysitter; or one simply opts for a "postmodern ist" reading that highlights the playful transgression of conventional plot structure. According to Alber et al., an "unnatural" reading of the tale should retain its bizarre ness and incomprehensibility, creating an alternate world in which weird scenarios are possible. Engaging in what the authors call "frame enrichment," this is what "un natural" narratologists do when they "conceptualize an impossible scenario in which</page><page sequence="9">What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology? 365 internal processes such as dreams, wishes, and fantasies become as real as external reality" ("Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology" 118). Note that the various scenarios are here aligned with the characters' wishes, dreams, etc., so that a mimetic focus creeps in by the backdoor. Under the heading of the "'point' of this unnatural scenario," by contrast, the authors then veer towards a typical postmodernist inter pretation of the story when they say that the text "makefs] us aware of suppressed possibilities, and allows us to choose the ones that we prefer ..." (118). Citing Ma rie-Laure Ryan's toolkit reading and Richard Andersen's comments on counteracting readers' inveterate desire for simple solutions (118-19), the authors thus seek to place the story within a clearly postmodernist aesthetic. By explaining some of the possible rationales of Coover's story, they in fact introduce a familiarization of the unnatural within a well-known postmodernist framework on the lines of Yacobi's generic prin ciple. This is not to deny the adequacy of this double reading, but to question to what extent such an interpretation differs from more common postmodernist approaches to the story, or from that of Towards a "Natural" Narratology. Put diiferently, if to highlight the unnatural is to find non-mimetic interpreta tions for it, then what is its difference in relation to postmodernist reading strategies of metafictionality, fantasy, contradictoriness, etc.? Or, seen from a different perspec tive, does the "unnatural" simply highlight the postmodernist and the fantastic both within and on the margins of realism and the mimetic? My second comment concerns the concept of fictionality in relation to the un natural.' It is quite obvious that—for us in the twenty-first century in the West at least—the magic or fabulous coincides with the fictional; many narratologists would additionally argue that postmodernism is self-consciously fictional. This overlap be tween the fictional and the "unnatural" as conceived here raises the question of a his torical reiteration of the familiar pattern of three stages of narrative development: (1) the pre-novel romance; (2) the novel and realism (the mimetic); (3) the postmodern anti-mimetic and metafictional. Whereas the realist novel is fictional on account of its reference to non-existing settings, characters and actions (though mostly set in supposedly real time), the magic and the metafictional are fictional because these entities could not exist (for us) or because reference in any case is suspended in favor of textual play. As Ruben Borg puts it, citing Beckett's Molloy, "Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining" (Beckett 176): "One can't go on yet one does go on; not in spite of an actual impossibility but by way of this impossibility which only fiction can overcome" (Borg 194). What "unnatural" narratology sets out to do is to escape from mimeticism. How ever, quite ironically so, by setting itself in opposition to the natural (what is unnatu ral must be the opposite of "natural" or mimetic), it falls into the trap of having to acknowledge the reality of the natural in the shape of the mimetic, even if the idea is to trace the non-mimetic underside of the mimetic. "Unnatural" Narratology thus partakes of a deconstructive methodology, inverting the dichotomy and, in typically Derridean fashion, colonizes the mimetic realm by means of its hitherto marginal ized complement, the so-called unnatural. One could, however, have performed this deconstruction without resorting to the term "unnatural." For instance, what is more "natural" than spontaneous conversational narrative?5 And yet, as Tannen and oth</page><page sequence="10">366 Monika Fludernik ers have shown, narrators actually invent dialogue where there was none and dis play non-mimetic or pseudo-mimetic performative features in their storytelling (see Fludernik, The Fictions of Language, chapter 9; Tannen, "Spontaneous Formulaicity," "Poetics of Talk", Talking Voices; Chafe). Another way of demonstrating how the impossible affects or infects the "natural" is to point to the epic as the original literary narrative and to discuss how omniscience is a standard strategy in this earliest type of literary narrative. And of course these ep ics were transmitted orally, so the omniscience can be traced right to the origins of oral narrative poetry. The question therefore is: does the creation of an "unnatural" narratology not undermine the legitimate aims of the sketched approach? Not only would the term non-natural preserve the contrast without creating additional problems of justifica tion; it also remains caught in the dichotomy and ends up reinforcing the mimetic rather than escaping from its clutches. Unlike queer studies, which queers the hetero sexual dichotomy between men and women, or between the homo- and heterosexual, the spirit of "unnatural" narratology would need a term that signifies a third space or position from which to analyze the negotiations between the mimetic and its various contraventions. (Perhaps impossible or phantasmal narratology could work.) This takes me to my third issue, namely the status of the mimetic in relation to naturalization. In particular, I want to return to Yacobi's existential principle which overrides impossibilities simply by fictional fiat: Gregor Samsa turns into a beetle, even if this is realistically impossible. It seems to me that Yacobi and Alber et al. deal with such a text quite differently and that their contrasting approaches are enlight ening in relation to how mimesis is conceived by them. Alber et al. would go about emphasizing the impossibility of Samsa's metamorphosis and therefore underline the fantastic quality of the narrative. Yacobi, on the other hand, deals with Kafka's story in referential terms. The existential principle is resorted to whenever "the loose or di vergent finds its place in an appropriate referential framework—generic or historical, institutionalized or individual, verisimilar or fantastic" ("Fictional Reliability" 117). Such texts, then, create a world that is like that and thus override the readers' protests against it. People do not turn into insects, but in Kafka's otherwise quite verisimilar narrative universe this is possible. To the extent that the existential principle partakes of the deviant, it bypasses mimesis in favor of an alternative (fictional) reality. Or per haps, one could also say that its aesthetic illusionism focuses on the insect and on the absurdity of combining an insect world with the human world. Kafka's ingenuity lies precisely in the fact that Gregor Samsa has not been transformed into a beetle by a wizard of fairytale status—this is no fairytale (where the generic principle might have accounted for the events)—but wakes up to find himself a beetle and therefore expe riences (and makes us experience likewise) the full horror of such a nightmare come true. The fantastic grotesqueness of this predicament is enhanced by being presented in so verisimilar a fashion. One can, therefore, not say that "Metamorphosis" is non natural and therefore non-mimetic. On the contrary, mimesis may be constitutive of non-naturalness not merely because the impossible is read against the backdrop of the "natural" and hence mimetic, but also because as fiction, such a text has to create aesthetic illusionism and therefore uses mimesis to achieve its effect of non-natural</page><page sequence="11">What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology? 367 oddity. "Unnatural" narratology would therefore be well-advised to contemplate its relationship to fictionality and mimesis in a less dichotomous manner. This takes me, finally, to the most interesting point of the essay by Alber et al.: its distinction between conventionalization and naturalization. The example the authors use to illustrate this distinction is that of omniscient narrative. From the perspective of anthropomorphic limitations, omniscience is an impossibility. We cannot look into other peoples minds, and a narrator who informs us about the most secret wishes and intentions of a character is therefore non-natural; he deviates from the norm of hu man behavior. Nevertheless, omniscience fast established itself as a key characteristic of heterodiegetic narratives. In "Naturalizing the Unnatural," I proposed to treat om niscient third-person narrative as a blend, i.e. as a creative extension and combination of two frames, that of heterodiegetic narrative and that of first-person self-analysis.6 By blending the two scenarios, an optimization becomes possible, namely a view into other peoples minds. Taking account of Alan Palmer's work on the social mind (e.g., "Intermental Thought," Social Minds), one could also argue that omniscience extends our ability to speculate about the thoughts of our fellow citizens, though the novel of consciousness does much more than that and in clearly extravagant detail. Alber et al. see the process of conventionalization at work when formerly "unnat ural" narrative scenarios become so familiar to us that they begin to constitute a new template or frame that has acquired generic acceptedness ("Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology" 131). They mention the "speaking animal" and "omniscient narrator" as well as the techniques of free indirect discourse and psychonarration. Such conventional forms, according to the authors, are "not necessarily" also natural ized, since they "still contain unnaturalness." So far so good. However, if convention alization concerns the institutional level, not affecting the inherent "unnaturalness" of the scenario and technique, what exactly do Alber et al. then understand by natural ization; what would be an example of it? How would one naturalize a speaking animal except by changing the world to one that has speaking animals? Perhaps the authors see naturalization exclusively as an interpretative process (like Culler)? But then it is to be placed on a different level from conventionalization entirely. Conventions be long to genres, social networks, practices. Interpretations may follow certain conven tions of reading texts and resort to clichés, categories or scenarios that have become familiar and therefore normalized through extensive use. The important insight—in this reading—would then be to note the metaphoric quality of the term naturalization as I have used it: not merely explaining away inconsistencies by recourse to "natu ral" mimetic frames but also reducing the feeling of impossibility or strangeness in a non-natural constellation. That reduction is bound to arise from repeated use, that is to say, from familiarity, and it is repeated use that moreover congeals the scenario as a new genre, thereby completing the conventionalization. It is very astute of Al ber et al. to note that the basic "unnaturalness" remains a semantic effect, resisting colonization from conventionality. However, I am not sure that this really applies to omniscient heterodiegetic fiction simply because it has been around since antiquity; nevertheless, this effect is very obvious in second-person fiction, where increasing use has tended to soften the oddity of the form and the process of normalization or con ventionalization seems to be well on the way, but where the inherent non-naturalness persists intact.7</page><page sequence="12">368 Monika Fludernik One will perhaps do well to raise the question of norms in relation to conven tions, underlining that one is talking of normalization and not normality, normal ization referring to averages (Link). For instance, it is now more normal to be an unwedded mother than it was in 1910; it is more normal for men to marry men; etc. Besides statistical normalization, we here get a similar consequence of quantity becoming quality: if more and more women have children without marrying their partners, this behavior becomes less unacceptable because widely practiced and more familiar. Some people may still be against such a practice, but their evaluative norm is undermined by statistical norms. Perhaps one can see the absorption of formerly un natural forms or elements of narrative as being normalized through popular use and secondarily conventionalized. To conclude: "Unnatural" Narratology appears to be a thriving field. Its major as sets lie in the new perspective on the magic and the experimental and metafictional as well as in the historical and social approach that this work makes possible. One line of enquiry that might be particularly fruitful is the recovery of both the fantastic and the impossible within the realist tradition and a discussion of the same phenomena in non-literary narrative, especially in conversational storytelling. Alber et al. end on the concluding flourish that "the unnatural is everywhere, and it is about time for narrative theory to embrace it" (131). Perhaps one can expand this by a reminder that there are "more things in heaven and earth ... than are dreamt on in [our] philoso phy" (Shakespeare, Hamlet, I, v, 11.166-67; 225). An analysis of how modern(ist) our empirical resistance to the fantastic is could help to foreground the intrinsic reliance of realism and of the mimetic on what is not usually regarded as "natural." Not only is realism illusionary, but the mimetic reproduces both that which is natural and fic tional scenarios that are non-natural. Endnotes 1. This essay was written as a contribution to Alber et al. (Poetics), but the editors thought that it should be part of a discussion forum in Narrative because of its direct engagement with Alber et al. ("Unnatural Narratives, Unnatural Narratology"). I have not rewritten the piece to transform it into the Forum format, but it appears here in a minimally revised version of what I handed in as an essay to this edited collection. 2. "All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off. All the super-added ideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns, and the understanding ratifies, as necessary to cover the defects of her naked shivering nature, and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation, are to be exploded as ridiculous, absurd, and antiquated fashion." (Burke 74) 3. Although Labov is generally credited with introducing the term natural narrative (see, for in stance, Simpson 114 et passim), the text of Labov and Labov and Waletzky does not seem to contain the collocation. 4. See Hopper and Traugott; Lakoff. 5. As Michael Holquist argued in his presidential address, "literacy is in its essence unnatural" (569). 6. In fact, I proposed two possible ways of arriving at omniscience by means of a blend ("Natural izing the Unnatural" 16-17).</page><page sequence="13">What Is Unnatural about Unnatural Narratology? 7. I have more misgivings about the inclusion of free indirect discourse and psychonarration in the list of "unnatural" techniques. If what is meant is the fact that free indirect discourse for the representation of thought and psychonarration are non-natural because they look into people's minds, this is just a way of saying that they express omniscience. Since psychonarration and free indirect discourse occur frequently in conversational narrative, it seems particularly odd to find them mentioned here. Works Cited Alber, Jan.
