This paper presents the findings of a detailed examination of six discs of data images emanating from a CT scan of the mummified remains of Ta-Sedgemet, who lived about 850-575 b.c. She was approximately 32 years of age at the time of her death. She was 1 56 cm tall, and weighed about 49 kg. Her long bones revealed no evidence of childhood illnesses, and her arteries appeared free of atheromatous tissue. However, she presented a right-side, paratracheal (non-Hodgkin) lymphoma; enflamed mucous membranes in the paranasal sinuses revealed an influenza-type infection; and her dental condition showed evidence of probable suppurative abscesses. Ta-Sedgemet was not a well woman when she died, 2,500 years ago. KEYWORDS: Egyptian mummy; restoration; stabilisation; spiral CT imaging; gross anatomy. INTRODUCTION To learn more about the mummy in its archaeology collection, Auckland Museum proposed a non-invasive CAT scanning procedure to be carried out at Mercy Ascot Hospital, Mountain Road, Auckland in 2002. Details of the acquisition of the mummy were obtained from a letter dated 26 February 200 1 by Roger Fyfe, Curator of Ethnology at the Canterbury Museum, to Dr Nigel Prickett, then Archaeologist, at the Auckland Museum. John Tinline, who is recorded as presenting the mummy to the Canterbury Museum in June 1888, had given Sir Julius von Haast, the museum's first director, £50 "to acquire things for the museum" while Haast was in London as a New Zealand Commissioner at the Colonial and Indian 'Exhibition Colindares' in 1886. Haast wrote to Enrico Hillyer Giglioli, Direzione del Museo Zoologico dei Vertebrati in Florence, who replied (2 November, 1886) that he: ... at once went in search of my Egyptian friend and colleague Prof. Schiapparelli [Ernesto Schiaparelli, born in Italy in 1856, Director of the Egyptian Museum in Florence, then the Museo Egizio di Torino ] . . . He was most kind, says that he is almost sure of procuring for your Museum the two mummies you desire, one plain and the other richer, he says that they can easily be sent direct from Egypt to Christchurch New Zealand and believes that with the package express not more than £30 (the sum you mentioned) will be required. Schiaparelli in turn wrote to Emile Brugsch, the assistant director of the Egyptian Antiquities Service and assistant conservator in the Bulaq and Cairo Museums. On 22 November 1886 Giglioli transcribed Schiaparelli s response: Ree. Auckland Mus. 47:111-127 2010</page><page sequence="2">112 DENNISON J'ai pris tous les renseignements au sujet de ce que vous me demandez - pour les Momie le Musée pourrait vous en envoyer une ordinaire dans le prix de 3 ou 4 livres sterlings. Quant à une belle momie, il n'y en a pas pour le moment, mais si vous le désirez on pourra vous en reserver une de celles que nous recollerons cette année soit à Thebes soit à Akemins. And finally, on 22 January 1887, Giglioli wrote to Haast: Yesterday Prof. Schiapparelli called on me, he also had been ill with measles - he gave me the enclosed letter which you can see by it that a good plain Mummy from Akhmim has been found for you and that you can have it for £5. Packing included. So if you still want it you have to write mentioning Prof. Schiapparelli's name to Mr Emile Brugsch Bey - sending the cheque for the amount to him and giving full directions for sending the case to Christchurch. The "good plain mummy" duly arrived at the Canterbury Museum in June 1 888, as did the "belle momie", the subject of an earlier paper (Dennison 1999). The former mummy bore the label, "FEMALE MUMMY / Probably 18th Dynasty. / Before the exodus of the Hebrews, / about 1500 b.c. / Pres. JOHN TINLINE." In October 1957 the mummy went to the Auckland War Memorial Museum, in exchange for a coconut grater, a head rest from Tikopia, and a drum from New Guinea. Over time, the effects of environment and relative humidity took their toll - efflorescence and deliquescence of the preservative salts on the surface of the wrapping bandages, stains from interaction of the coffin wood on the bandages and flaking of paint from the sarcophagus. When the mummy was withdrawn from display in 1998 for the refurbishment of the Hall of Man Gallery, the opportunity was taken for a detailed study of the coffin and mummy, and for a thorough stabilisation of the damage to them. For the sake of completeness, extensive use has been made of Auckland Museums Conservation Report Number 1 1673, kindly provided by Julia Gresson, then Senior Conservator. The anthropomorphic coffin (Fig. 1) consists of a lid and base, constructed of planks, identified by Lloyd Donaldson at New Zealand Forest Research, Rotorua, using scanning electron microscopy, as being from the fig tree, probably Ficus sycomorus which is richly represented in Egyptian tombs of the Early, Middle and Late Kingdoms (Zohary and Hopf 2000:165). The planks are held together by dowels of the same wood. The coffin lid and base are closed by tenons - flat pieces of acacia wood fitting into three matching slots in the upper edges of the base and locked into place by sycamore dowels inserted through the sides of the coffin. A layer of daub, an inorganic clay mixture, has been applied to the wood substrate to mould the shape further and to infill between the wood sections where necessary. The coffin lid bore a face painted over a fine white ground of both gypsum (Chemistry Department, University of Auckland) and lime plasters. The ground layer had been applied to a carved face which had then been painted with flesh-coloured skin, pink ears and lips, and black rims round the eyes, black pupils, and black eyebrows (Fig. 2). Studies by the Chemistry and Engineering Departments at the University of Auckland indicate that the pigments used were bone or ivory black, iron ochre and calcite, and an egg binder. The remainder of the coffin is painted with a black background adorned with yellow figures and hieroglyphs. The decoration of the upper surface of the coffin consists of the hieroglyphs in horizontal registers on the upper body and in vertical registers down the leg area. The yellow pigment was identified as orpiment (A s2S3). The black paint is most likely charcoal-based with a gum binder. Some areas appear to have been coated with varnish.</page><page sequence="3">TA-SEDGEMET II3 Fig. 1. The mummy of Ta Sedgement, in a safe environment.

The preserved human body within the coffin is covered with a single cloth pulled tightly round the body, gathered round the feet, and knotted beneath the neck (Fig. 3). Microscopic examination of the fibres revealed the cloth to be linen. The cloth has a plain weave and the individual fibres an V twist. The spacing of the weave varies, as does the thickness of the fibres. Individual sizes of the warp and weft are doubled where extensions to the fibre have been made.</page><page sequence="4">114 dennison Fig. 3. The body is tightly- wrapped in a shroud, which is knotted under the neck. Fig. 4. Detail of the bandaging: salt deposition and staining are visible, as are slots for pegs in the coffin lid. Auckland Museum. Over the outer cloth, thinner, folded bandages criss-cross the body to produce a tight pattern: two diagonal bandages cross each other over the torso (Figs 1,4), seven encircle the body at regular intervals between the ankles and shoulders, and a central bandage runs the length of the body. Except for the shoulder bandages and the two around the ankles and lower leg, the bandages are double-layered - a broader band beneath a thinner band. All are neatly folded along their edges. This was the most intricate body-wrapping that I have seen. The material analysis and conservation process was launched in 2001 by a donation from the Chisholm Whitney Family Charitable Trust. Damaged and fraying bandages were painstakingly stabilised and repositioned. The identification of sulphates, chlorides and carbonates in the efflorescent deposits on the bandage surfaces (Fig. 4) indicate that sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2C03NaHC03.2H20, most commonly found in its mineralised form as trona) had been used as the preserving agent. It was essential to remove the salt deposits using minimal water. The most successful method tested was the careful application of a cellulose pulp. The bandages were stained in places, although staining did not occur on bandages overlain by other bandages. That and the fact that the staining occurred in areas that would be close to the coffin wood, indicate that the staining was from the wood itself. After much exhaustive testing, the flaking paint was secured to the wooden coffin using a cellulose ether in a slowly-evaporating solvent. Areas of fragile wood were consolidated with an acrylic resin and filled where necessary with a combination of paper pulp and a cellulose ether. During the conservation process, a volunteer Egyptologist, Shirley Temm, retired lecturer from the Department of Ancient History, University of Auckland, battled the fading paint to decipher the hieroglyphs. Samples of coffin wood and linen bandage have been dated by the Radiocarbon Laboratory at the University of Waikato to a range of 850-575 b.c. While those dates are for the flax and tree that provided the covering of the corpse and might conceivably have been recycled, the Conservation Report states that those dates are consistent with stylistic elements of both coffin and mummy; therefore not before the "exodus of the Hebrews, about 1500 b.c." The mummy's final resting place is a sealed, nitrogen filled display case designed by Shin Maekawa of the Getty Conservation Institute and engineered by Device Works of Parnell. In this way the low-oxygen environment and the reduced humidity will markedly delay further deterioration of the earthly remains of this person.</page><page sequence="5">TA-SEDGEMET 11$ METHOD After four years of painstaking restoration and stabilisation, the mummy was secured in a custom- built cradle (Fig. 5) and, on the morning of Sunday 27 February 2005 transported to Mercy Hospital in Mountain Road where the spiral CT scanning procedure was undertaken in the Mercy Radiology Group offices by Margaret Bowcock and Dr Mark Osborne (Fig. 6). This procedure culminated in six discs of computerized axial-tomographically (CT) scanned images (Fig. 7). A full description of the spiral CT data collection process has already been provided in an earlier publication (Dennison 1999). Disc 1 contained 236 items, including 92 Linux Networx Portable Network Graphics (In. png) -formatted items; 23 pg-png items; and 91 skin effect (se.png) items. Disc 2 contained 70 items, including 25 In. png items; 7 pg-png items; and 25 se.mpg items. Disc 3 contained 43 1 Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine-standard (DICOM) images as transverse slices, from the crown of the head to the upper thorax, with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm, at 0.8 mm intervals.

Auckland Museum.</page><page sequence="6">II 6 DENNISON Fig. 7. Full-length images of Ta-Sedgemet. Disc 4 contained 660 DICOM images, of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with a slice thickness of 1.2 mm, at 0.8 mm intervals. Disc 5 contained 736 DICOM images of the lower limbs, with a slice thickness of 1.2 mm, at 0.8 mm intervals. Disc 6 contained 240 DICOM images of the ankles and feet, with a slice thickness of 1 .2 mm, at 0.8 mm intervals. All the images were imported into OsiriX, an open-source programme written by Antoine Rosset MD. Selected images were exported as files in JPEG compression format, and further processed by Adobe Photoshop Elements v.3.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.). RESULTS The body lay supine with arms extended by the sides. The forearms were rotated medially so that the hands lay side-by-side, palms-down over the pelvis, with fingers extended (Fig. 7). The legs were extended also. Packing may be seen between them (Fig. 7d), placing the legs parallel and in a stance position. As with Tash pen Khonsu in Canterbury Museum, Ta-Sedgemet does not appear to be wearing any jewellery. The brain, now much dessicated, remains in situ - in fact the vertical falx cerebri and the horizontal tentorium cerebelli are visible, undisturbed (Fig. 7d). The heart is still present (Figs 7 b- e) as are the lungs. The diffuse appearance of the abdominal contents suggests that these have been packaged, although no (usually left-side) incision mark was found, where the evisceration would have been carried out (Sigmund and Minas 2002), nor was there any stela to indicate such an incision. Alternatively, evisceration may have been carried out per ano. The pelvic girdle measured 1 10.0 mm from the pubic crest to the interface of the fifth sacral</page><page sequence="7">TA-SEDGEMET II J vertebra and the first coccygeal vertebra; the inter-ischial spinal breadth was 1 1 1.8 mm; and the maximum breadth of the pelvic brim was 131.3 mm. These gynaecoid features of a broad sciatic notch, a broad pelvis with oblique ilia, a short symphysis, and a large subpubic angle (Fig. 8), left no doubt that this mummy was female. Her age at death was estimated by applying Todd's (1921) description of age-related changes at the pubic symphysis (Fig. 8, right) to the three-dimensional shaded-surface-display (SSD) reconstructions, and enlargements of the two-dimensional orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions (MPR) to view the symphyseal face (Fig. 9, right). The dorsal margin is very clearly defined and sharply-lipped. The furrows and ridges are still present on the right symphyseal face although it is bevelling, and a rampart is starting to form on the left-side face. She is therefore in Todd s fifth-sixth phases - aged between 27 and 35 years at death. The computer-recorded stature is 1453.1mm (4 feet 9.2 inches). However, dehydration and subsequent shrinkage will have taken place, especially at the intervertebral discs. Following Reyman and Pecks (1998:109) technique, using the bicondylar or physiological' length of the left femur (41.3 cm), from an enlarged Image 3 on Disc 1 Trotter and Glesers (1952) formula for 35-year-old caucasoid females was applied, to reconstruct a possible live stature of 156.35 cm (5 feet 2 inches). The normal weight range for a non-obese female of this height is between 43.2 and 52.3kg (Sunderman and Boerner (1949). Ta-Sedgemet's weight during life would therefore be 47 ± 4 kg. In summary then, Ta-Sedgemet was a 156.4-cm-tall woman weighing 47 ± 4 kg, who was 31 ± 4 years old when she died, 2,500 years ago. She 'looked' healthy, but her oral health was very poor, (Fig. 10). The maxillary dentition consists of right second and first molars, canine and both incisors, both left incisors, stump of canine and second premolar, and first and second molars. The mandibular dentition consists of Fig. 8. Left-side and frontal views of the pelvis, (3D SSD reconstruction). Fig. 9. Transverse-, anteroposterior-, and median sagittal views of the pubic symphysis.</page><page sequence="8">Il8 DENNISON Fig. 10. Anterolateral view of Ta- Sedgemeťs upper body, illustrating good skin thickness, healthy bone, but poor oral health. Fig. 1 1 . Ta-Sedgemeťs dentition. The submandibular salivary glands are visible in the lower right image; the white dots are nerves viewed end-on. right first molar through to right central incisor, and left lateral incisor through to first molar (Fig. 11). Most of the teeth are severely worn; dentine is visible in some cases. The only teeth showing cusps are the upper second molars, probably because the two opposing mandibular second and third molars were lost before death and hence nothing was left for those upper molars to occlude with, and grind against. There is loss of alveolar bone evident on the right side of the mandible, which no longer was needed to support those two lost right molar teeth. Tall lingual cusps may indicate a tendency to have bitten down towards the right. While the cusps of the upper right second molar are in pristine condition, that tooth presented a large carious lesion of its medial surface. Ta-Sedgement suffered extensive periodontal disease, in the maxillary premolar region and the mandibular left incisai region. She would probably have suffered suppurating dental abscesses during later life. By use of the sagittal image 'slices', the head can be examined in the lateral plane as well, from the left side (Fig. 12, upper left), progressing to the right side, (Fig. 12, lower right). Remembering that Ta-Sedgemet was lying on her back, the images show both the soft tissue outside the skull and the shrunken brain tissue within the skull pooling' to the back. The tentorium cerebelli , which separates the occipital lobe of the cerebral hemisphere from the cerebellum (best seen at lower, right) remains intact. Proof that Ta-Sedgemeťs brain had not been removed via the nose during the embalming process, is given by the intact 'floor of the anterior cranial fossa - in particular, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone above the eye sockets, as seen in the upper right image. The upper left image shows, very clearly, at left middle, the anterior, middle, and posterior ethmoidal paranasal air cells. The upper and lower anterior teeth are visible also and the tongue at the back of the mouth. Immediately below the tongue (upper left image) is seen the cartilaginous epiglottis curving back. Immediately behind the anteriorly-curving cervical spine, the intact spinal cord is seen descending from the base of the skull and, behind it, the spinous processes of the cervical</page><page sequence="9">TA-SEDGEMET II9 vertebrae. Almost in the centre of the upper right image, the sphenoidal paranasal air sinus has come into view, opening anteriorly into the spheno-ethmoidal recess at the top-back corner of the nasal cavity. The little depression immediately above it is the pituitary fossa, straddling the midline and formed by the bony sella turcica (Turkish saddle). The pituitary gland is still visible within the pituitary fossa. In front of the opening of the sphenoidal sinus, the oblique structure is the superior concha of the right-side wall of the right nostril and, obliquely above it, is the partitioned frontal sinus again, bounded by the outer- and inner tables of cortical skull bone, sandwiching the spongy' middle layer of bone above the frontal sinus. The lower left image shows the inferior concha of the right-side nasal wall and up above are the ethmoidal air cells of the right side and the right frontal sinus. The black space' in the middle of the bottom edge of the lower left image is created by the neck cushion pad not being right up against the back of the neck at this point. To left of centre in the lower right image is the right eye socket, or orbital cavity. The dehydrated eye has sunk back into the socket and the wrapping material has intruded down onto it. The square' area immediately below the orbital cavity is the right maxillary paranasal air sinus, with the root of an upper molar tooth projecting into the sinus. Inside the maxillary sinus the mucous membrane is still visible. That this mucous' membrane has not shrivelled up in the 2,500 years of hot-climate dehydration might possibly be explained by Ta-Sedgemet having had an infection, (causing the membrane to swell, with goblet cell secretion) at the time of her death. Up at the top of the neurocranium (brain case) is a deep pit almost half the thickness of the vault. Figure 13 shows a similar pit. These are probably Pacchionian pits (found only in parietal bone about 2.5 cm either side of the lengthwise midline) where the arachnoid granulations drain cerebrospinal fluid into the superior sagittal sinus. Fig. 12. A series of lateral views, from left to right, of Ta-Sedgemet's head.</page><page sequence="10">I20 DENNISON Fig. 13. A series of views, from front to back, ofTa-Sedgemet's head. Figure 1 3 presents anteroposterior (coronal) views of the head, from the front, (head facing us), towards the back of the skull. The wrappings of the head are clearly visible. The upper left image shows the thick frontal bone above the orbits, or eye sockets. The barely-discernible vertical line is the falx cerebri that separates the two cerebral hemispheres (which would have sunk towards the back). The falx cerebri descends to its anterior attachment to the crista galli in the midline. Immediately on either side, are the paired cribriform plates of the ethmoid bone, transmitting olfactory nerve fibres to the upper part of the nasal cavity. The paired scroll-like structures on either side are the turbinate bones, or inferior conchae, of the nose. Further to the sides are the paired maxillary sinuses - the mucous membrane lining the left sinus being slightly more visible than the membrane in the right sinus. Above the sinus, diffuse-looking optic tissue is seen in the left orbital cavity, while the oval structure in the right orbital cavity is the sunken lens of the eye. The upper right level shows the midline, vertical, intact odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra providing a bony 'body for the first cervical vertebra above it. Immediately above is the posterior region of the pituitary fossa, roofed by the horizontal diaphragma sellae' while to right and left are the horizontal auditory canals passing into the petrous temporal bone. The cranial vault on the upper left side (upper right on the image) shows a pit on the inside and a broader depression on the outside (both of these commenced at Image slice 16 and finished by Image slice 20). Some discrete notches are visible on the inner cortical table of the cranium, (appearing also in the upper-left image of Figure 14). These are profiles of the grooves marking the course of the middle meningeal artery supplying the lateral surface of the outer, dural, layer encasing the brain. The image at lower left shows the intact meningeal partitions - the vertical falx cerebri and the more-horizontal tentorium cerebelli. The triangular area above the vertical falx is the superior sagittal sinus, collecting the superior venous drainage of the brain, while at either lateral extremity</page><page sequence="11">TA-SEDGEMET 121 of the tentorium are end-on views of the transverse venous sinuses, which drain into the paired sigmoid sinuses and ultimately form the internal jugular veins. In the middle, where the three meningeal partitions come together, is the great cerebral vein (of Galen) draining the deeper territory of the brain. Some vestiges of brain tissue remain adherent to the meninges. The lower right view shows clearly the paired cerebellar hemispheres lying beneath the tentorium cerebelli. Finally, Figure 14 presents transverse images of the head, viewed from the soles of the feet up towards the head. The image at upper left is a cross-section of the upper region of the cranial vault with the grooves for the middle meningeal artery clearly visible. Ta-Sedgemeťs head rested on a spongy cushion placed within her body wrappings. An almost-perfectly-cylindrical, dense object lay inside this cushion. It was visible between image slices 19 and 31 inclusive. Assuming that each image is 1 .25 mm thick, the object would be 1 .63 cm long. Moving downwards we see the intact, though dehydrated eyes in the orbital cavities on either side of the nose. The optic nerve is visible on the right side. The thick vertical tissue running towards the bottom of the upper middle image is the straight sinus, draining mostly to the left transverse sinus, with a small communication with the right transverse sinus visible also. Some residual brain tissue is evident. The image at upper right shows the delicate tracery of the ethmoidal paranasal air sinuses between the orbital cavities, the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, the almost-horseshoe-shaped tentorial incisure, with the straight sinus behind. The image at the left of the lower row shows the median septum of the nose deviating to the right, with the eye sockets on either side. Immediately behind those orbital cavities are the paired temporal fossae with the coronoid process of the mandible very distinct on the right temporal fossa and temporalis muscle tissue visible in the left fossa. Behind these fossae the angled condylar heads of the mandible are visible at the temporomandibular joint, with the petrous temporal bone, containing the auditory apparatus, behind. Moving further down, we can see the rounded alveolar arch carrying the remaining upper teeth, with the tongue behind. It proved difficult to show the exposed dentine, in particularly the molar teeth. The carious lesion is visible on the medial surface of the right first molar tooth. The spinal cord is visible also. The lower right image shows the mandibular dentition. With dehydration of the soft tissue, a large gap has developed within the wrapping of the body, particularly on the right side. The left image of Figure 1 5 is a transverse section at the level of the seventh cervical vertebra. Fig. 14. A series of views of the head as seen from below - from brain-level to lower jaw-level.</page><page sequence="12">122 DENNISON This shows detail of the wrapping very clearly, with small white pebbles or grit lodged within the folds. The round white circles mark the head of the humerus, articulating medially with the scapula (a ligament is visible on the right head - looking from beneath). In the midline is the thickened cartilaginous wall of the trachea, with the collapsed oesophagus direcdy beneath, and the white left recurrent laryngeal nerve sandwiched between them. The small vessel immediately left of the nerve is the left common carotid artery. The V-shape of the spinous process of the vertebra is visible, with the dura surrounding the spinal cord centrally and, immediately laterally, the emergence of the eighth cervical mixed spinal nerve. At the bottom are the blades of the two scapulae, with the two coracoid processes above. Image enlargement revealed that the left common carotid artery is clear of any atheroma; nor does the humoral joint show any arthritic changes. The image on the right is at the level of T3 (third thoracic vertebra) showing the upper lobes of the lungs collapsed towards her back, recalling that Ta-Sedgemet was lying supine; the two humeri and scapulae are visible - the left humerus is touching the lip of the glenoid process, suggesting that the right side of her body had angled slightly downwards. The trachea is visible in the midline and, at the 'five o'clock' position in relation to it, is the left subclavian artery abutting the left common carotid artery. Rib slices flank the trachea above, with the manubrium of the sternum between. At theT4-5 level, (Fig. 16), the arch of the aorta is in the centre of the left-side image with the vertebra behind, and the sternum, flanked by the (paired) internal thoracic arteries and veins, in front. The right-side pleura is clearly visible with its lung contents slumped posteriorly. The bright, white spots beside the aortic arch and immediately in front of the trachea are a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Evans and Hancock, 2003) that has invaded the right-side pretracheal lymph nodes, and presents this nodular opacity in the images. It is visible in Image slices 84-101, which means, if each image is 1.2 mm thick, that the lymphoma covered a length of 2.04 cm. The image on the right of Figure 16 shows a longitudinal view of the lymphoma. Ta-Sedgemet s lymphoma is highly localised. She may have suffered fever, night sweats, fatigue, abdominal pain, indigestion, anaemia, infections, loss of appetite and/or weight, and bone pain. The swollen mucous membrane in the maxillary sinus therefore comes as no surprise, since her immune resistance would have been low. Fig. 15. Cross-sections of the body at the levels of the seventh cervical vertebra and of the third thoracic vertebra, respectively. Fig. 16. The bright white spots at the level of the interface of the fourth and fifth thoracic vetebrae reveal a right paratracheal non- Hodgkin lymphoma.</page><page sequence="13">TA-SEDGEMET I23 Moving down to the level of the seventh and eighth thoracic vertebrae, the heart itself is clearly visible, in situ (Fig. 17). In the image on the left the sternum is at the top, and the upper arm bones on either side. The heart is in the centre, flanked by the lungs. Looking up from the feet, just to right of centre is the upper chamber of the heart - the right atrium and, down to its left (5 o'clock position), the entrance to the aorta. To its left is the thick-walled left ventricle, and behind that the right ventricle. In the image on the right the non-Hodgkin lymphoma is indicated again by the bright spot in the pretracheal lymph nodes and, directly below, the V on its side outlines the flaps of an atrio-ventricular valve attached to a papilla (10 o'clock position). Behind are the curved thoracic vertebrae, while the large bone at the same horizontal level as the lymphoma is an end-on view of the clavicle (collar bone). The transverse view on the left, (Fig. 18), at the level of the first/second lumbar vertebrae (LI -2) indicates how much the abdominal contents have collapsed. The right kidney can still be seen, protected by the ribs. The image on the right is a comparative axial maximum intensity projection (MIP) image of the wrapped abdominal contents of Paankhenamun (Foster et al. 1997). It appears that Ta-Sedgemet's abdominal contents may have been wrapped also. The two longitudinal views of thorax- abdomen-pelvis (Fig. 19) show the diffuse nature of the abdominal contents. The large opaque areas seem to support the view that the abdominal contents had been wrapped during the embalming procedure. The pubic symphysis is seen at the bottom of the images, and the right femoral head is visible on the left image. The heads of both femora are seen on the right image of Figure 20, with no hint of osteoarthritis at the hip joints. The left shoulder joint is visible; the right shoulder joint is forward of the image plane, while the lumbar vertebrae have curved backward behind the image plane. The left image shows mild subluxation at the sacro-iliac joints, due to subsidence" over time - this is nowhere near as dramatic as seen in Ta-Sedgemet's sister' mummy, Tash pen Khonsu in the Canterbury Museum, who had been forced into her coffin (Dennison 1999). Similarly, the knee joints are healthy, and free of osteoarthritis (Fig. 21). The right leg is positioned more anteriorly than the left, since the posterior surface of the right femoral condyles are in the plane of the image on the right, while the anterior surface of the left knee appears.

Lateral views of Ta-Sedgemeťs left foot and her right foot. Likewise, the ankle joints appear free of osteoarthritis (Fig. 22). The left foot is seen along the plane of the great toe, while the right foot shows the third toe caught up by the wrappings. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This mummified body is excellently preserved and intact. Bones, muscles and tendons have retained their natural configuration. There are no visible fractures and the only articular dislocation was where the third toe of the right foot was caught up during wrapping of the body after death. The wrappings are intact yet the body has no metal amulets or stela adornment, which is unusual. Similarly the mummy of Pa-es-tjau-em-aui-nu from the XXV or XXVI Dynasty (Sigmund and Minas 2002: 1856) bore no metallic ornamentation, although since her wrappings had been obviously torn and cut up, the authors attributed this to grave robbery. In Ta-Sedgemet s case the wrappings remained intact (Fig. 4) and were very similar in pattern to those of an adult female from the XXI Dynasty, housed in the British Museum (Peck 1998: 26). The efflorescence of the preserving 'salt' on the bandages is unsurprising; the sodium sesquicarbonate preservative is commonly found throughout Egypt as the mineral 'trona'. That word may be more easily recognised in its earlier, Egyptian form natron or the Hebrew natrum'. This commonly used mummy-preservative is found most commonly in the Wadi Natrun, north-west of Cairo (Ikram and Dodson 1998: 103). The word natron is, in turn, derived from the Ancient Egyptian netjry meaning 'divine salt' (Sigmund and Minas 2002: 1858). Radiocarbon dating of coffin wood and her wrappings, and the Conservation Report have stated that Ta-Sedgemet lived at some period within 850-575 b.c. That range covers mid- to late Third Intermediate Period to early Late Period (Ikram and Dodson 1998) - the XXIII to the XXVII Dynasties. She predates her contemporaneous acquisition, Tash pen Khonsu in the Canterbury Museum by some 600 years (Dennison 1999). In that earlier study it was mentioned that Isherwood et al. 1979, had pointed out that the position of a mummy's arms and hands might be significant in assessing chronology. Gray (1972) had reviewed the position of arms and hands on radiographs of 1 1 1 mummies. He found that of 47 mummies from the period between the XXI Dynasty and the start of the Ptolemaic period when the Greeks took power through Alexander of Macedón installing General Ptolemy I as pharaoh, all except two had their arms extended. Only four Ptolemaic mummies had their arms extended; 1 5 had their arms folded across the chest. Only three mummies of the later, Roman period had their arms folded; 40 had their arms extended (Gray 1972: 200). Thus mummies' arms were extended during both pre-Ptolemaic times and during Roman times. However there was a difference - in the earlier period the hands were prone over their respective groin areas whereas in the Roman period the hands were over</page><page sequence="16">126 DENNISON the outer surface of the thighs (Sigmund and Minas 2002). Figure 7 a therefore provides further evidence that Ta-Sedgemet had lived in pre-Ptolemaic times. The presence of intact meninges, intact cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and intact oral and glottal tissues indicate that the brain had not been removed, either through the nose, as in the case of Paankhenamun from the XXII Dynasty (Foster et al. 199 7: Fig. 1 5) or via the foramen magnum, as in the case of Pa-es-tjau-em-aui-nu from the XXV or XXVI Dynasty (Sigmund and Minas 2002). However, brain removal was not mandatory - it does not appear to have been carried out in the mummies ofThutmose I, Thutmose II, orThutmose III (Russell et al. 1980). Ta-Sedgemet s dental attrition was severe, but only one site of dental caries was seen. In several adult Ptolemaic mummies studied dental caries was rampant (Leek 1979a). This may be another piece of evidence that Ta-Sedgemet had not lived in Ptolemaic times. On the other hand, dental cusp attrition had been a problem throughout Egyptian history. Bread was the staple diet and, from different sites and different time periods the flour contained the same impurities from soil, storage, and from grinding methods but additionally a high level of quartz contamination from wind-blown sand (Leek 1979b). The later Greek and Roman influences may have led to dietary changes and consequent onset of carious lesions. Figures 15-17 illustrate that the chest cavity had been left untouched by the embalmers - the lungs and heart were still present. In Sigmund and Minas's study the lungs had been removed (to prevent putrefaction) and replaced by "filling material". They believe that the heart had been removed, yet the aorta is still clearly present. Usually the heart would not be removed, as in Ta-Sedgemet s case, for the Ancient Egyptians considered the heart to be the source of human wisdom and the centre of all emotions. It was traditionally left intact so that the deceased in the after-life could present it to be weighed against a feather on Maats scales of justice in the Final Judgement (Zabalgoita 1996; Dennison 1999) - light heart: ascend to the gods; heavy heart: descend to the nether regions. One of the ethical principles adhered to by this project was to ensure due respect, dignity and care for Ta-Sedgemet at all times. Therefore, any disruption of the mummy, or her coffin was viewed as unacceptable, unnecessary, and irreversible. Much effort has been expended by the staff of the Auckland War Memorial Museum to ensure that her mortal remains suffer no further deterioration 2,500 years after her death. My findings therefore, are based on a totally non-invasive study. The skeletal evidence itself shows that Ta-Sedgemet was a healthy woman, about 32 years of age, height 1 56 cm, and weighing 49 kg, at the time of her death. However, examination of the soft tissue revealed evidence of paratracheal lymphoma; enflamed mucous membranes in the paranasal sinuses revealed an influenza-type infection; and her dental condition showed evidence of probable suppurative abscesses. Ta-Sedgemet was not a well woman when she died, 2,500 years ago. REFERENCES DENNISON, K.J. 1999 Tash pen Khonsu: The mummy in the Canterbury Museum. Records of the Canterbury Museum 13: 31-42.
