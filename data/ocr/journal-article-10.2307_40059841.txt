<plain_text><page sequence="1">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ECOLOGICAL POETRY AND ECOTHEOLOGY John Sitter Significant eighteenth-century English poems, particularly works by Alex- ander Pope and James Thomson, convey a vision that we may usefully read as ecological, as in fact more ecological than that of much nineteenth-century poetry. Because eighteenth-century ecological thinking is virtually always theological - that is, providential, grounded in discourses of "physicothe- ology" and theodicy - I will argue further that eighteenth-century nature poetry's affinities extend not merely to contemporary ecology, including in some cases "deep ecology," but also to ecotheology. While the physicotheol- ogy of the eighteenth century and today's ecotheology are by no means the same thing, the emergence of the latter in recent decades may put us in a better position to appreciate poetry grounded in the former. How much do physicotheology and ecotheology share and how do they differ? The question is difficult since ecotheology now means a great many things. Stressing its hermeneutical emphasis, for example, recent commen- tator Anne Hallum specifies ecotheology as the "rediscovery of ecological themes in a variety of religious texts," while a literally cosmic definition is proposed by Sallie McFague, for whom an "ecological theology" is "one that rests on the relative absolute of giving glory to God by loving the world; that understands its context to be the well-being of the planet," taking as R&amp;L40A (Spring 2008) 11</page><page sequence="2">1 2 Religion &amp; Literature its subject the "entire cosmos with all its creatures, human and otherwise" (Hallum 55; McFague 33). Another proponent argues that an effective eco- theology depends on three main concepts: "the intrinsic value of all beings, the interconnectedness of all beings, and sustainability" (Darragh 168). Given the variety of the field, it may be difficult to define ecotheology any more precisely than does The New Catholic Encybpedia: "The objective of ecological theology is to spell out, in this case from within the context of Christian tradition, precisely why people of faith should care about the nonhuman natural world" (Logan and Haught, "Ecology"). But perhaps it will suffice here to see the relation of physicotheology to ecotheology in broad terms. A definition of physicotheology comes more easily since most of its late seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century practitioners would have agreed with the man who in 1 7 1 3 wrote the book, the Rev. William Derham. Derham defines the project in his subtitle: Physico- Theology: Or, a Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, from His Works of Creation, Contemporary ecotheologians do not, so far as I can tell, write to prove God's existence, though much of the recent work does seek to redescribe divine attributes. An extreme instance is Mark Wallace's definition of the Holy Spirit as an "earthen reality" and the "green face of God who animates the living food chains that make possible the flow of energy and sustenance for all of us" (Wallace 296, 312). Natural theology in our time often reads, James Gustafson concludes, "more as explication of an experience of the divine than evidence for a rational argument to prove that God exists" (Gustafson, Sense of the Divine 42). In general, its practitioners are likelier to construct arguments for rereading the Bible in light of today's environ- mental emergencies than for reading the Book of Nature to prove that God must have written it. A second difference is that physicotheology emerges more as confident apology than as a crisis discourse, while ecotheology is unimaginable without a strong sense of planetary peril. Physicotheology's general argument that a more attentive study of the creation leads to fuller knowledge of the creator implies ethical norms of curiosity and gratitude, but it does not automatically lead to the ecotheological imperative of radical change in public thought and action. Beneath their differences, however, physicotheology and ecotheology share two visionary premises: the natural world is properly seen as the "amazing whole," in Alexander Pope's phrase, and our usual anthropocentric perspective must be overcome to appreciate nature's true meaning {An Essay on Man 1.248). It is these underlying similari- ties that now open the possibility of a sympathetic ecotheological reading of eighteenth-century poetry.</page><page sequence="3">JOHN SITTER 13 Romantic Misunderstandings In recent years, several students of the nineteenth century who are also environmentally minded have associated the literary origins of modern ecological consciousness with Romanticism. Jonathan Bate's Romantic Ecol- ogy: Wordsworth and the Environmental Tradition (1991) and Karl Kroeber's Ecological Literary Criticism: Romantic Imagining and the Biology of Mind (1994) began in earnest not only the greening of Romanticism but, so to speak, the Romanticization of greenness. The presumed equation of the development of Romanticism and modern responsiveness to the natural world appears in works with titles such as Green Writing: Romanticism and Ecology and The Green Studies Reader: From Romanticism to Ecocriticism, as well as in Bate's later Song of the Earth (all 2000). In what follows I will suggest that to find a literary precedent for some aspects of our contemporary ecological perspective we need to look harder at eighteenth-century than nineteenth-century poetry. If a "deep ecological" perspective in particular is by definition skeptical of anthropocentrism (seeing the world in terms of human interests and resources) and of the tendency to regard the natural world as merely the setting for human actions, then such a view may share more with James Thomson, Alexander Pope, and William Cowper than with William Words- worth, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Because this claim runs counter to some deeply rooted suppositions in literary studies, and even in European historiography, it will be necessary to begin with what might seem rather minor, intramural quarrels within English studies. The nature of eighteenth-century poetry is still misrepre- sented by silence in the studies of many Romanticists. Critics emphasizing the "sublime" remain in the habit of following Harold Bloom's influential studies of the 1970s in leaping directly from Milton to Blake.1 Kroeber's important work ignores not only Pope and Thomson but also Thomas Gray and William Collins, poets who often make at least cameo appearances in discussions of Romantic poetry, as well as Oliver Goldsmith, George Crabbe, and William Cowper. These last are closer chronologically to the body of work that Kroeber believes is the "first literature to anticipate contemporary biological conceptions" and to what he sees as the Romantic poets' "en- duringly significant discoveries of humanity's place in the natural world" but remain invisible in his study (Kroeber 2). Unlike Kroeber, Jonathan Bate at least gestures toward eighteenth-century authors and concedes that Wordsworth "by no means initiated" the "tradition of environmental consciousness" with which Romantic Ecology links him. But it is not clear in Bate's world who did. He mentions Thomson only to associate him with</page><page sequence="4">1 4 Religion &amp; Literature Newton and invokes Pope only to posit Romantic superiority: Wordsworth and Coleridge were walking poets every bit as much as they were poets of the imagination. Imagine Alexander Pope composing poetry: we see him sitting in a patron's house or a coffee-house. Imagine Wordsworth and Coleridge composing: we see them in the open air as Hazlitt did. ... (Bate, Romantic 49) In fact, Pope seems to have spent more time composing in his own home overlooking the Thames River than in either of the locations Bate imagines for him. But the point is conventionally symbolic: an artificial (or mechanical) Enlightenment opposed to a natural (or organic) Romanticism. In Song of the Earth Bate sees Romanticism as the "antagonist" of the Enlightenment, protesting the eighteenth century's "objectification of the spirit" (78). It is up to "Romanticism and its afterlife" to explore the "relationship between external environment and ecology of mind" and to grasp "poetic language as a special kind of expression which may effect an imaginative reunification of mind and nature" (245, 252). But the idea that poetry is a special discourse that might reunite mind and nature was current at least a century earlier. Milton said the purpose of education, including poetry, was to "repair the ruins of our first parents" (366-67) and John Dennis intensifies this Edenic vision in 1701 in The Ad- vancement and Reformation of Modern Poetry: Poetry seems to be a noble Attempt of Nature, by which it endeavours to exalt itself to its happy primitive State; and he who is entertained with an acomplish'd Poem, is, for a Time, at least, restored to Paradise. That happy Man converses boldly with Immortal Beings. Transported, he beholds the Gods ascending and descending, and every Passion, in its Turn, is charm'd, while his Reason is supremely satisfied. Perpetual Harmony attends his Ear, his Eye perpetual Pleasure. Ten thousand dif- ferent Objects he surveys, and the most dreadful please him. Tygers and Lions he beholds, like the first Man, with Joy... (172-73) Bate and other Romanticists interested in the question could argue that Dennis was a minority voice or that his program for poetry rarely surfaces in eighteenth-century poetry itself. One might argue, for instance, that much eighteenth-century poetry is decidedly not Edenic or Utopian, deriving its energies of irony and urbanity instead from skepticism about the sort of "transport" Dennis imagines. Or that eighteenth-century nature poetry is, finally, less "natural" (in some stipulated sense) than Romantic poetry about "humanity's place in the natural world." But in fact most Romanticists seem not to think these or any other arguments are even necessary in asserting the originary force of nineteenth-century writers as the "fathers and mothers of our environmental tradition" (Bate, Romantic 61).</page><page sequence="5">JOHN SITTER 15 The Bards and the Bees Just before Romantic Ecology appeared, Geoffrey Hartman had predicted Wordsworth's "greening" in his essay "'Was it for this, ..?\ Wordsworth and the Birth of the Gods," observing that "as the concrete jungle looks for its ecological saint, Wordsworth's reputation should soar" (Hartman 8). Hart- man takes his title from the famous passage of self-examination in Book I of The Prelude that originally opened the "Two-Part Prelude" of 1 799: Was it for this That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song, And, from his alder shades and rocky falls, And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice That flowed along my dreams? (1.269-74) Important differences between a Wordsworthian stance toward nature at the end of the eighteenth century and that of James Thomson's Seasons seven decades earlier come into view when we juxtapose this passage to one superficially like it from Autumn, first published in 1 730: And was it then for This you roam'd the Spring, Intent from Flower to Flower? for This you toil'd Ceaseless the burning Summer-Heats away? For this in Autumn search'd the blooming Waste, Nor lost one sunny Gleam? for this sad Fate? (1 184-88) The ambiguity of Wordsworth's "Was it for this. . .?" is much of the subject of Hartman's essay, since the pronoun is originally without antecedent in the "Two-Part Prelude." But in the larger context of the full Prelude it more clearly refers to the poet's own development and current impasse. The lines poignantly intensify the poet's criticism of his own indecision and failure to write the poetry he should, while "Unprofitably travelling toward the grave, / Like a false steward who hath much received / And renders nothing back" (1.267-69). And soon the poet decides that the unprofitable "this" must be made to add up to something more - "For this, didst thou, / O Derwent! . . . / Where I was looking on, a babe in arms, / Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts / To more than infant softness..." (274-78). Thus, the eventual resolution of this book of The Prelude can be seen as the con- version of "this" from a failure to write poetry to this poem that this poet is now producing. What had been a self-critical rhetorical question now takes a real answer: yes, the natural surroundings conspired to produce the poet now speaking.</page><page sequence="6">1 6 Religion &amp; Literature Thomson's insistent question - "And was it then for This?" - differs vastly, of course, both in apposition and in what it flows from and leads to. Thomson's "This" refers not to his poem or to himself but to the "sad fate" of a beehive wantonly destroyed by humans, plundered rather than harvested for its honey: Ah, see where, robb'd and murder'd, in that Pit Lies the still heaving Hive! at Evening snatch'd, Beneath the Cloud of Guilt-concealing Night, And fix'd o'er Sulphur. ..(11 72-75) Attempting to represent the act from the bees' vantage, Thomson imagines the human violence against nature occurring while, not dreaming 111, The happy People, in their waxen Cells, Sat tending public Cares, and planning Schemes Of Temperance, for Winter poor; rejoiced To mark, full flowing round, their copious Stores. Sudden the dark oppressive Steam ascends; And, us'd to milder Scents, the tender Race, By Thousands, tumble from their honey'd Domes, Convolv'd, and agonizing in the Dust. (1 173-81) Because there is a long history of describing bees in humanized, social terms, Thomson's use of the word "people" may not be surprising. It may seem odd to contend that a passage so apparently anthropomorphic is less anthropocentric than Wordsworth's apostrophe to the Derwent; but I will try to demonstrate more fully in the second half of this essay that it would be a mistake to assume that Thomson's "people" is merely metaphorical, merely a sentimental or genteel substitution. But perhaps enough has been said here to suggest that Thomson's description of the bees is arguably more ecologically focused than is Wordsworth's apostrophe. And one way to argue the point is to appeal to Lawrence Buell's four differentiating features of an "environmentally oriented" literary work. In The Environmental Imagination (1995), Buell proposes these criteria: 1 . The nonhuman environment is present not merely as a framing device but as a presence that begins to suggest that human history is implicated in natural his- tory. . . . 2. The human interest is not understood to be the only legitimate interest.... 3. Human accountability to the environment is part of the text's ethical orienta- tion. . . . 4. Some sense of the environment as a process rather than as a constant or a given</page><page sequence="7">JOHN SITTER 17 is at least implicit in the text. (7-8) In this light, the endings of the passages from Thomson and Wordsworth become all the more significant. This portion of The Prelude ends with the poet asserting that the river gave him a promise of "calm" in later years "amid the fretful dwellings of mankind." The passage from The Seasons, on the other hand, ends lamenting human abuses of the non-human environ- ment: O Man! tyrannic Lord! how long, how long Shall prostrate Nature groan beneath your Rage, Awaiting Renovation? (1 189-91) I will return to the question of human tyranny later. The Peopled Grass The point of this comparison of moments in The Seasons and The Pre- lude is not to elevate Thomson over Wordsworth poetically, politically, or theologically. Generations of readers have not only responded powerfully to Wordsworth aesthetically but seem frequently to have been influenced by his poetry to want to preserve natural surroundings. But juxtaposing Thomson's and Wordsworth's poetry may help clarify what "nature poetry" can mean and how we can understand the relationship of characteristic ways of portraying nature in the earlier eighteenth century to Romantic modes. The word "people" offers one clue. In his monumental study The Language of Natural Description in Eighteenth-Century Poetry (1949), John Arthos included "people" in his 267-page Appendix glossing "Certain Words Significant in Eighteenth-Century Poetry, with Illustrations from Earlier Poetry and Scientific Literature." The word is in fact part of a network of terms noted by Arthos and familiar to students of the period: "See also," Arthos notes, "Band, Breed, Brood, Choir, Citizen, Crew, Flock, Fry, Herd, Host, Inhab- itant, Kind, Legion, Nation, Race, Seed, Shoal, Squadron, Train, Tribe, Troop." All of these words, typically preceded by an adjective, denote bio- logical categories: "feathered kind," "scaly breed," and so on, have their ancient counterparts in words such as gens, genus, grex, and others. As the presence in this list of "citizen" and "nation" underscores, such groupings are not only taxonomical but social. They do not simply categorize by physical characteristics; instead, they emphasize the communal existence of swarms of insects or flocks of birds or schools of fish. It is not easy to tell just how</page><page sequence="8">1 8 Religion &amp; Literature figurative or realistic some of these usages are. At the comic extreme, they tend toward mock-heroic, but often they are used more for precision than for periphrasis (Tillotson 21-22, 38-45). Thomson's description of poultry as "household feathery people," for example, is not just euphemistic; it highlights a group of shared characteristics, including domestication. Thus it partitions reality differently than, say, the category of "chickens," which would be both less precise and overly restrictive. "Chickens" would not construct the same niche, and, since to name something is to suggest what is not being named, it could not imply the larger, unmentioned, but highly relevant category of wow-household feathery people, or the also relevant category of wwfeathery people. That last category we may take, anthropocentrically, to mean simply "people," referring, that is, to us featherless bipeds. This probability brings us back to the question of just what to make of the eighteenth-century tendency to use "people" to refer both to animals and humans - a usage which seems to die out in the early nineteenth century - and its correlate, the common use of the participial "peopled" to mean "populated," whether by people or animals. When Wordsworth at the end of the century writes in Descriptive Sketches (1793) that "soon a peopled region on the sight / Opens - a little world of calm delight" (208-09) he means that he sees cottages. But when in the middle years of the eighteenth century Aaron Hill and Thomas Gray speak of the "peopled air" or Henry Travers of the "peopled Wave" they see birds and fish, not flying or swimming human beings.2 The same is true for Pope early in the century when he complains that the Norman kings "dispeopled Air and Floods" by their arrogant misuse of the land {Windsor- Forest, line 47), an episode to which we will return. While the more common use of people and peopled in the eighteenth century designates humans, the crucial point is that these broader meanings were easily available for writ- ers from roughly the 1690s through the 1780s but then drop away fairly quickly in the nineteenth century. (Erasmus Darwin is a belated poet of the older diction when, in The Temple of Nature (1803), he describes "feathered nations" flying overhead while "Emerging insects leave the peopled ground" [II. 376, 380] .) The fact that a broader range of meaning for people was open to eighteenth-century poets than to most nineteenth-century poets deserves more attention than it has received. Do these "people" - myriad, scaly, feathery, finny, household - have more in common with humans in the eighteenth century for sharing a name? Quite possibly. Let us linger for a moment on the older "peopled" and the current use of the related word "populated." An area proposed for oil drilling is said not to be populated. An opponent replies that, yes, it is, say by caribou and wolves. It is theoretically possible to use populated in both senses today,</page><page sequence="9">JOHN SITTER 19 but the first sense is usually the default meaning. That does not seem to have been the case with peopled in the eighteenth century. The word is often marshaled to soften the boundary between human and animal. John Hughes sees a "peopled prospect" (an inhabited landscape) because "Sheep grace the Hills, and Herds or Swains the Fields" (I. liv). Similarly, when Dryden describes plains as still "unpeopled" it is because neither the sheep nor the shepherds have returned to them (Georgics III. 721). For Thomas Blacklock, the "peopled earth and starry skies" make up the theater in which we see an all-inclusive divine "energy prevail / Through Being's ever-rising scale, / From nothing ev'n to God" (17-18).3 The narrower, strictly humanistic sense of "peopled" that has become dominant since Romanticism belongs to another world view than does one of the most famous "nature" passages from An Essay on Man, Pope's celebra- tion of creaturely connection (I. 207-80). Pope begins with a vivid close-up of insect life: Far as Creation's ample range extends, The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends: Mark how it mounts, to man's imperial race From the green myriads in the peopled grass! (207-10) These lines may have been influenced by a passage in Thomson's Summer a few years earlier (1727), in which insects become visible in the sunlight. Emerging from their chrysalises, by Myriads, all at once, Swarming, they pour: green, speckled, yellow, grey, Black, azure, brown. . . Ten thousand Forms, ten thousand different Tribes! People the Blaze.4 Samuel Boyse would echo both Thomson and Pope closely in 1738, contemplating creation "From the unwieldy Whale's enormous Mass / To the small Insect on the peopled Grass" (Boyse 153). The general idea of plenitude is common property, of course, and its most popularly influential English statement was probably Addison's Spectator 519: Every part of Matter is peopled: Every green Leaf swarms with Inhabitants. There is scarce a single Humour in the Body of a Man, or of any other Animal, in which our Glasses do not discover Myriads of living Creatures. The Surface of Animals is also covered with other Animals, which are in the same manner the Basis of other Animals that live upon it; nay, we find in the most solid Bodies, as in Marble it self, innumerable Cells and Cavities that are crouded with such imperceptible Inhabit- ants, as are too little for the naked Eye to discover. On the other Hand, if we look</page><page sequence="10">20 Religion &amp; Literature into the more bulky Parts of Nature, we see the Seas, Lakes and Rivers teeming with numberless Kinds of living Creatures: We find every Mountain and Marsh, Wilder- ness and Wood, plentifully stocked with Birds and Beasts and every part of Matter affording proper Necessaries and Conveniencies for the Livelihood of Multitudes which inhabit it. (Addison 4: 346) Repeatedly in eighteenth-century nature poetry we meet such "people," even when we can not quite see them. Thomson and his peers are fascinated by both the visible inhabitants of their environments and the teeming "unseen People" (Summer, 311) who fill the air and water. Man's "Imperial Race" Reconsidered The notion that Romanticism marks the birth, or rebirth, of "green" consciousness turns on the idea of a late Renaissance and Enlightenment "disenchanted" and "mechanistic" Nature. According to this familiar nar- rative, some fatal combination of Cartesian philosophy and the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century abruptly killed off an organic Nature and replaced it with the world as machine. The "disenchantment" story has been attractive to critics of the Enlightenment from Max Weber to the present. Emblematic titles from the 1980s urging the need for recovery from Enlightenment thought are Morris Ber man's The Reenchantment of Na- ture (1981) and Carolyn Merchant's heavily influential The Death of Nature (1983). Merchant's more recent work, Radical Ecology (1992, 2nd ed. 2005) repeats the story of mechanism's lamentable triumph in stark terms: "This mechanistic worldview, which arose simultaneously with and in support of early capitalism, replaced the Renaissance worldview of nature as a living organism with a nurturing earth at its center. It entailed an ethic of control and domination of nature and supplanted the I-thou ethic of reciprocity between humans and nature" (11). Whether this narrative is true in relation to general European history is debatable. It seems to me to oversimplify both the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and to draw a harder line between organic and mechani- cal metaphors of order than really obtains. Whether it is true in relation to English literary history seems doubtful. It has the reductive appeal of a dissociation-of-sensibility narrative like T.S. Eliot's - in which the seven- teenth century is also where the Fall occurred - combined with an uncriti- cal, latter-day romanticism that sees itself as having to recover Nature from the accumulated artifice of intervening generations. Eliot did not invent the idea of lapsarian poetic dissociation, of course. In English studies this view of eighteenth-century poetry was enshrined in 1913, for example, in</page><page sequence="11">JOHN SITTER 21 the Cambridge History of English Literature in the odd but symptomatic view that the "poetry of Thomson's day had ceased to hold direct communion with nature" and that his contribution, at his best, was a "return to earlier methods" (Thompson 97). The earlier methods are supposedly pre-Miltonic. But whose exactly? Just which poets are supposed to have held "direct com- munion with nature," writing nature poetry independent of the "medium of literary reminiscence"? One looks in vain in the preceding nine volumes for an account of such poetry. The noted environmental historian Donald Worster offers a partial corrective to the myth of a Romantic discovery or recovery of the natural environment simply by beginning his survey, Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas, in the eighteenth rather than nineteenth century. Worster recognizes the deep kinship between the earlier vocabulary of "natural economy" (a phrase Sir Kenelm Digby first used 1658) and our own "natural ecology" (Worster 37). But Worster 5s important work also helps perpetuate an oversimplified view of eighteenth-century thinking about nature by dividing its natural philosophers into two camps, "Arcadians" and "Imperialists." The latter dominate, following the essentially Baconian program of seeking natural conquest (Worster, 30-3 1).5 "Arcadian" ecology is typified by the genial Gilbert White, whose Natural History of Selbourne (begun in the 1 760s and published in 1 789) "laid the foundations for the natural history essay in England and America" (5). White is an Arcadian for Worster because he finds an ideal harmony within the environment he observes and has little interest in controlling it. But "the Gilbert Whites of the age often went un- heard," Worster contends, because an "anti-Arcadian tradition" or "impe- rial3 view of nature" was more "militant and popular" in the period. This view made - and makes - the "domination of the earth... one of modern man's most important ends" (29). Pope's phrase, "Man's imperial race," might seem to support Worster's view of "imperial" dominance in eighteenth-century ecological thinking, but a close look at poetic diction and contexts offers a more complex picture. In most of its eighteenth-century uses "man's imperial race" suggests human kinship with other animals and responsibility for them. The phrase comes into English poetry through Dryden's translation of Virgil's third Georgic (1697), in a passage describing the universality of sexual appetite: Thus every Creature, and of every Kind, The secret Joys of sweet Coition find.</page><page sequence="12">22 Religion &amp; Literature Not only Man's Imperial Race; but they That wing the liquid Air; or swim the Sea, Or haunt the Desart, rush into the flame: For Love is Lord of all; and is in all the same. (III. 377-82) The phrase is Dryden's invention (Virgil speaks simply of "every single race on earth, man and beast," [Georgic III 242]) 6;with "Imperial Race" Dryden momentarily suggests a hierarchy only to emphasize more intensely the leveling force of the real "lord," Love. Pope plays on the phrase to make a related point in The Rape of the Lock, where no one would dare speak of "coition" but where attenuated sexuality governs all: Love in these Labyrinths his Slaves detains, And mighty Hearts are held in slender Chains. With hairy Springes we the Birds betray, Slight lines of Hair surprise the Finny Prey, Fair Tresses Man's Imperial Race ensnare, And beauty draws us with a single Hair. (II. 23-28) Pope's later use of the phrase in An Essay on Man - encompassing the Chain of Being from the "green myriads" to "Man's imperial race" (I. 210) - recurs frequently in the middle decades of the eighteenth century. James Grainger in his georgic Sugar-Cane (1764) writes of the benefits of cross-breeding varieties and observes that "In plants, in beasts, in man's imperial race, / An alien mixture meliorates the breed." Grainger takes this truth as evidence that "all depends on all," that "God is love, / And wide creation shares alike his care" (1. 458-67). William Hayward Roberts in 1 77 1 would trace a similar course "From the small insect... thro all the tribes / Of this full-peopled globe... To man's imperial race" (Roberts 15). Christopher Pitt's rendering of the Aeneid (1753) is particularly suggestive of the egalitarian force of this "imperial" language. Some of his phrasing of a lofty prophetic passage from Book VI seems to owe as much to Pope as to Virgil. The same creative spirit or "general soul" of nature that "Glows in the moon, and burns in every star" and that "lives in the parts, and agitates the whole" is the common source of animals and man: From that celestial energy began The low-brow'd brute; th'imperial race of man; The painted birds who wing th'aerial plain, And all the mighty monsters of the main. (VI. 1007-1 7) A long footnote to this passage suggests just what sort of work such phrasing is intended to do. Pitt quotes a passage from Bishop Berkeley's Siris (1744)</page><page sequence="13">JOHN SITTER 23 arguing that Virgil shares Platonic and Pythagorean beliefs that "the soul of the world, whether having a distinct mind of its own, or directed by a superior mind, doth embrace all its parts, connect them by an invisible chain, and preserve them ever well adjusted and in good order" (Virgil, Works IV 249-50). Characterizing the human species as "imperial" seems everywhere in eighteenth-century writing to underscore participation and responsibility rather than exceptionalism. We can more completely grasp the fact that "man's imperial race" occu- pies a position in the eighteenth century closer to responsible steward than licensed exploiter by attending to a phrase commonly opposed to it: "tyrant man." In Anne Finch's "A Nocturnal Reverie" the animal joy and general peace only endure "whilst Tyrant-Man do's sleep" (38). In Mary Leapor's "Man the Monarch" the beasts' "Tyrant, Man" fancies himself entitled to "despotic sway" over his "mute Brethren" and is punished for his hubris.7 In Thomson's Autumn (1730) the "steady tyrant Man" is steady only in his "thoughtless insolence of power" and love of hunting. "Inflamed, beyond the most infuriate wrath" of beasts, such a man "For sport alone pursues the cruel chase" (390-94). For William Somerville in Field-Sports {1 742), "Tyrant Man" is a "Free-booter unrestrained" who "Destroys at will / The whole creation, Man and Beasts" (Somerville 14. 96-98). The terms remain op- erative late in the century in James Beattie's explanation of how the young poet-in-the-making of The Minstrel (1 77 1-74) loves nature but not hunting or trapping: "He wished to be the guardian, not the king, / Tyrant far less, or traitor of the field" (I. xviii). The ideas of imperial responsibility and tyrannical hostility come together in Abraham Tucker's compendious The Light of Nature Pursued (1777), which contains a vigorous argument for more generous conceptions of the place of animals, "our younger brethren," in the providential order. As members of creation's "imperial race" humans must not imagine themselves the "sole care of heaven," Tucker insists, because God's "divine oeconomy" includes the animals and perhaps even extends to their resurrection. Given the large role played by "their labours, their sufferings and their lives in the progress of his great work of the Redemption," Tucker argues, "why should we think it an impeachment of his Equity, if he assigns them wages for all they undergo in this important work?" Just as in the next world humans may "rise from sensitivo-rational creatures to purely rational, so they may be advanced from sensitive to sensitivo-rational." There we may be in effect the animals' guardian angels, "becoming lords and not tyrants of our new World." For Tucker, the answer to Thomson's question about human exploitation of the creation - "O Man! tyrannic lord! how long, how long / Shall prostrate Nature groan"? - would seem to be until we become properly "imperial"</page><page sequence="14">24 Religion &amp; Literature enough to "exercise government by employing our superior skill and power for the benefit of the governed" (3:1 16-1 7).8 Pope's Windsor-Forest begins and ends with Pope's celebration of proper political authority - in which "a Stuart reigns" (42) - and the forest's har- mony. An opening hymn to Windsor's apparently timeless Edenic grandeur rolls on for 42 lines, until Pope abruptly reveals that this present energetic beauty is a historical condition. The Forest's present "Order in Variety," where "tho' all things differ, all agree," contrasts sharply to the evil days of the Normans: Not thus the Land appear'd in Ages past, A dreary Desart and a gloomy Waste, To Savage Beasts and Savage Laws a prey, And Kings more furious and severe than they: Who claim'd the Skies, dispeopled Air and Floods, The lonely Lords of empty Wilds and Woods. (43-48) Claiming absolute sway and possession rather than shared usufruct, the Normans no sooner began to conquer than they made waste - Pope repeats the word four times in the first 80 lines - of what had been vital, emptying an ecology of human and animal "people" alike. As tyrants rather than lords, the conquerors claim even the environment itself. "Elements" in these lines means "the natural abode [s] of any particular class [es] of living beings" (OED definition 12): Cities laid waste, they storm'd the Dens and Caves, (For wiser Brutes were backward to be Slaves.) What could be free, when lawless Beasts obey'd, And ev'n the Elements a Tyrant sway'd? (49-52) The poem is largely a poem about good "forest" ecology and good govern- ment. I put "forest" in quotation marks because Windsor Forest is explicitly no "forest primeval." It is a mixed region of agricultural habitation, village life, and green preserve, and its natural history cannot be separated from human history. That is what makes it logical in the wider and radical eighteenth-century sense in which the "economy" of nature and of human domesticity have not yet grown distinct. This unity does not mean, however, that humans rightfully have unrestrained dominion over the land, a point sometimes ignored in New Historicist readings of eighteenth-century poems as apologies for empire. Pope does see the forest as a natural and national resource, its "tow'ring Oaks" providing the ship-building timber for "future Navies" (22 1-22), and he happily envisions new houses and churches under</page><page sequence="15">JOHN SITTER 25 construction on the sides of the Thames (375-78). But of course there is no reason why Pope, writing near a London of not much over half a mil- lion people, should have been worrying about overdevelopment or, when he advocates better roads and harbors at the end of the Epistle to Burlington (1731), about vanishing wetlands. Such projects are truly "Imperial Works" (204) not because they enable rapacity but slow it down, requiring care and an imagination of the future. An Essay on Man's Equal God and Ecotheology An Essay on Man is a poem of paradoxes, only some of which are fore- grounded famously, as in the great verse paragraph (II. 1 - 1 8) on the "middle state" of the human animal as "Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all." An unstated but more foundational paradox is the fact that a poem so deeply anthropological - "the proper study of mankind is man" - should also be so deeply anti-anthropocentric. The poem's voice is most insistent, often strident, in inveighing against human "Pride," for Pope a combination of theological presumption and anthropocentric complacency. We might now think of it as ecological arrogance: Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine? Earth for whose use? Pride answers, "Tis for mine: For me kind Nature wakes her genial pow'r, Suckles each herb, and spreads out every flow'r; Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew; For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings; For me, health gushes from a thousand springs; Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise: My foot-stool earth, my canopy the skies.' (I. 131-40) Pope casts this egotism of the species, which today preoccupies ecologists of various "depths," as a form of sin, from which the Essay's reader must be saved. I use this vocabulary because An Essay on Man does. Although self-consciously post-Miltonic and secular rather than Biblical, An Essay on Man, as we will see most clearly when we come to its third epistle, presumes an ecological Fall and the need for redemption. Poetic redemption comes through the expansion of the imagination, which is why the imperative to "see" recurs so often and why the poem puts such emphasis on vision, both empirical and extrapolative. The long paragraph (I. 207-32) containing the "green myriads" appeals to the sight of things familiar from observation (dogs, pigs, birds, bees) or representations (lynxes, lionesses, elephants).</page><page sequence="16">26 Religion &amp; Literature This mode of visual noticing and poetic containment is epitomized in the splendid and punning close-up of the sensitive spider who "feels at each thread, and lives along the line" (218). But immediately following this visual detail, beginning "See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth, / All matter quick, and bursting into birth," soon enjoin the reader to imagine all those parts of "th' amazing whole" that "no eye can see, / No glass can reach" (233-48) but which are to be inferred from what our eyes, duly opened, can see. Any theodicy and any religious poem - and An Essay on Man is both - will of course appeal at some point to the unseen, but Pope most values what can be seen, if only through effects. Pope's account of God as the soul of everything, which led some eighteenth-century readers to question his orthodoxy, approaches the emphasis various contemporary ecotheologians put on creation theology and the Holy Spirit as creative energy.9 In these lines a series of heavily stressed verbs bridge the gap between visible and invisible. God-as-Soul, "chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same" (269), is the immanent creator who Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees, Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent, Spreads undivided, operates unspent, Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part. . .(27 1-75) My italics are probably unnecessary given Pope's conspicuous parallelism and placement. The last verb is the most important of all in the poem's ecological vision: "To him, no high, no low, no great, no small: / He fills, he bounds; connects, and equals all" (279-80). God "equals" all things by participating in all parts of the creation alike. "Equal" as an adjective occurs at three other points in the poem, twice before the passage just quoted and always as a divine attribute. The first is the poem's broadest rejection of anthropocentrism, challenging the reader to try to imagine the perspective of the Creator, Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, A hero perish, or a sparrow fall, Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd, And now a bubble burst, and now a world. (87-90) Two verse paragraphs later the word "equal" concludes the famous lines (99- 1 1 2) beginning "Lo! the poor Indian," lines that, oddly, have often been read as condescending. The "untutor'd" South American native may know less than the modern Englishman whose mind "proud Science" has "taught</page><page sequence="17">JOHN SITTER 27 to stray / Far as the solar walk, or milky way." But the Indian's theology be- gins closer to home. He "Sees God in clouds" and "hears him in the wind," displaying an imagination fundamentally in harmony with the vision the poem cultivates of a God who "Warms in the sun" and "refreshes in the breeze." Whatever quaintness might seem to attach to his idea of a heaven just "Behind the cloud-topt hill" vanishes in its indictment of European tyranny: his heaven is merely his native land restored, minus Christians and their "thirst for gold." Finally, he imagines that when he is "admitted to that equal sky, / His faithful dog shall bear him company." Readers who have found the passage condescending have presumed, I think, that the Indian is meant to look ludicrously wrong in his imagin- ings. But much in the poem suggests he may be quite right. Without going outside the Essay to the sort of speculations on animal salvation that we saw in Abraham Tucker, or to Pope's own conviction that "creatures we are so little above as dogs" might well have immortal souls,10 we can see in Epistle III that the concept of an "equal God" who welcomes humans and animals alike is crucial. This section of the poem ("Of the Nature and State of Man, with Respect to Society") is perhaps the most like Paradise Lost in that it tells a story of a Fall in order to explain why we are where we are. The Fall in Pope is less personal and more historical; that is, it seems to have been species-wide and to have occurred at some point within history rather than as its origin. Pope posits an original state of nature that owes more to Locke and Ovid than to Hobbes and Lucretius. "Of the State of Nature: That it was Social," reads Pope's note to his account, and this irreducible sociality was not limited to humans: Man walk'd with beast, joint tenant of the shade; The same his table, and the same his bed; No murder cloath'd him, and no murder fed. In the same Temple, the resounding wood, All vocal beings hymn'd their equal God. . .(III. 152-56) Pope's account shares many features of versions of the Golden Age by Ovid and others, commentators have often noted: the primal age was one of simplicity, harmony, vegetarianism, and so on. The narrative is notable for its seriousness - this is not Ovidian literary imitation but speculative history - and for the precise features of pre- and post-lapsarian existence it emphasizes. In the purer time, humans and animals praised God alike outdoors and of course no animals were killed, even sacrificially. For obscure reasons but no less surely, Conquest and Superstition eventually triumph,</page><page sequence="18">28 Religion &amp; Literature and praying in the woods - under the "equal sky" of the Indian - will no longer do: "Then sacred seem'd th'etherial vault no more; / Altars grew marble then, and reek'd with gore" (263-64). These later, indoor gods are "partial" and "form'd like tyrants" (257, 260). But before the Fall, "Heav'n's attribute was Universal Care, / And Man's prerogative to rule, but spare" (159-60), a relationship, in other words, of responsible dominion. Looking back to Windsor-Forest, such a relationship could not have been understood by Pope's Norman kings. Within An Essay on Man, ecological and political "tyranny" likewise go hand in hand. Original "Nature knew no right divine in men," while a corrupted history rests on the "enormous faith of many made for one" (236, 242). These lines on the unnatural absolutism of tyrants seem also in context to apply to "tyrant man," now grown "foe to Nature" in relation to other species, "Of half that live, the butcher and the tomb" (162-63). Believing that many species are made for one is an ecological er- ror no less "enormous" than political absolutism; in fact, these corruptions support each other. A major challenge of An Essay on Man is to keep in mind both the distant God, remote enough to see with "equal eye" heroes, sparrows, atoms, sys- tems, bubbles, and worlds, and the immanent God, breathing in the breeze and in our souls and bodies. Somehow the post-Newtonian reader, who knows something of the law of gravity and the plurality of worlds, and the Poor Indian, who seems to know his world more sacramentally because he knows no other, are both right. The sophisticated reader is criticized within the poem as liable, in intellectual pride, to imagine himself the "Wit and Tyrant of the whole"; but if he saw his species' uniqueness properly he would find it in the fact that "Man cares for all" (III. 50, 57). That the poet who wrote "Whatever is, is right" spent so much of his life criticizing wrongs should prompt one to consider what the phrase can and cannot mean. "It depends," as former President Bill Clinton testified, "on what the meaning of the word cis' is." Does it mean a state of being or an event bound by time? In equating existence and Tightness Pope would seem to be referring not to events but to general existential truths, the hu- man condition, the ways of the world, which in this poem are of course ultimately God's ways. This is the leap of faith required, as Kant would say a few decades later, in any ostensibly philosophical but necessarily religious theodicy (Kant 283-97). But An Essay on Man does more than say that one finally has to trust God. It says one has to see, looking everywhere, high and low, and imagining visually after sight runs out. Here, as the vehicle of vision, poetry may play a redemptive role. In the human history Pope outlines in Epistle III, humankind partly and gradually emerges from the Fall into confusion and tyranny caused by Superstition. Great poets, like</page><page sequence="19">JOHN SITTER 29 great leaders, help guide human society back toward the condition before the Fall. Again the verbs are pivotal: Twas then, the studious head or gen'rous mind, Follower of God or friend of human-kind, Poet or Patriot, rose but to restore The Faith and Moral, Nature gave before; Re-lum'd her ancient light, not kindled new, If not God's image, yet his shadow drew... (III. 283-88) In Pope's speculative history, the poet helps undo the misdeeds of Super- stition, who frightened mankind into bowing before "Pow'r unseen" (252); the poet instead works through power seen. By putting so much stress on the visible Pope suggests that what he ultimately means by "Whatever is, is right" might be "Whatever is, IS." Here are the facts of creation, the sense data and ecological extrapolations from which any discussion and possible understanding must begin. The preference for the concrete even in this most abstract of his poems marks what I have been calling an ecotheologi- cal commitment. South African theologian Ernst Conradie suggests a likely direction for contemporary ecotheology that looks for divine immanence in the creation without devolving into pantheism: this project is very much Pope's challenge. It is to explore the notion of "transparence" in order to acknowledge that we cannot know that which transcends the world and should not search for transcendence outside the world we know. Instead, it may be possible to focus exclusively on that which is immanent until it becomes transparent, that is, until it reveals unexpected depth dimensions that transcend our knowledge. The mystery does not lie in that which transcends the visible, the audible and the touchable, but in the marvel of that which is created. The mystery is that there is something and not nothing! (Gonradie 296) James Thomson and Creation Theology James Thomson's 405-line poem Winter burst onto the literary scene in 1726. Summer and Spring, each over 1,000 lines, followed in 1727 and 1728. By 1 730 The Seasons, now including Autumn and "A Hymn on the Seasons," was a poem of 4,464 lines and would eventually grow by over 1 ,000 lines more. It was arguably the most popular poem of the century, going through scores of editions in England and America within a few decades and con- tinuing in popularity well into the middle of the nineteenth century. As the poem grew it arguably lost some of its "race" as Johnson said in his Life of Thomson, "a word which, applied to wines, in its primitive sense, means</page><page sequence="20">30 Religion &amp; Literature the flavour of the soil" (Johnson 4.104). It became less strictly a poem of place, centered in the Scottish landscape of Thomson's youth, and a more comprehensive poem informed by Thomson's reading of natural as well as cultural history and his global curiosity. The reader looking for only mo- ments of the natural sublime, such as the snow storm in Winter, may find the encyclopedic reach distracting, as will the modern "green" reader who assumes that local poetry of place is the most authentically environmental form of poetry. But a fundamental fact about The Seasons is that as it grew and became a poem not of one soil but of many soils it also became a more deeply ecological - and ecotheological - poem. A good example of this kind of development is a long passage Thomson added to Autumn in 1 744 largely on hydrology. That Thomson wanted to take on such a poetically unpromising topic and indeed managed to make poetry of it has much to tell us about the project of The Seasons. The lines in question (756-835) were added because Thomson had changed his mind about how lakes and rivers are constantly supplied with fresh water. The 1 730 version of the poem adopted the old "percolation" theory, according to which salt water from the oceans is supposedly drawn through sand and gravel, purified of its salt, and released into bodies of fresh water. The newer "condensation" theory, already emerging in the late seventeenth century, triumphed in the 1730s, and Thomson replaced his brief account of per- colation with a long one of condensation (McKillop 75-88). For Thomson, understanding how the water cycle works is to see the sun, atmosphere, and earth holding the "social commerce" that supports the "full-adjusted harmony of things" (834-35). That phrase reminds us that The Seasons is among other things a physi- cotheological poem and a theodicy, celebrating God by studying his works and arguing that "From seeming evil" the Creator is always "educing good" [Hymn 114). But Thomson the poet cares less for philosophical demonstra- tion than visual demonstration. The scientific passage in question rises to a level of visual - and visionary - insistence that a century later would have no home in English poetry: I see the rivers in their infant beds! Deep, deep I hear them, labouring to get free; I see the leaning strata, artful ranged; The gaping fissures to receive the rains, The melting snows, and ever dripping fogs. ...I see the sands, The pebbly gravel next, the layers then Of mingled moulds. . . Beneath the incessant weeping of these drains,</page><page sequence="21">JOHN SITTER 31 I see the rocky siphons stretch'd immense.... (808-12, 813-15, 820) Reflecting on this section as a whole lets one appreciate Thomson's funda- mentally ecotheological vision. He had not undertaken this long excursion for the sake of versifying earth science itself. Ecology rather than geology, as the beginning of the verse paragraph makes clear, is the theme, an ap- preciation of earth's habitats and biological hospitality: Say, then, where lurk the vast eternal springs, That, like creating Nature, lie conceal'd From mortal eye, yet with their lavish stores Refresh the globe, and all its joyous tribes! (773-76) Like An Essay on Man, The Seasons stresses the continuities between the visible creation and its invisible extensions, including those parts of "th' amazing whole" that "no eye can see, / No glass can reach." Thomson suggests in these lines that "seeing" the world's network of underground waters is to glimpse natura naturans - "creating Nature" - at work. Thomson puts his dual interest in immediate perception and a theoretically informed perception succinctly in Summer. To the poetic observer schooled in "serene Philosophy" (science as well as philosophy in our sense) the world is simul- taneously "To reason's and to fancy's eye displayed." Fancy's eye allows immediate, sensual appreciation of the "whole magnificence of heaven and earth, / And every beauty," while reason's eye lets one trace the "chain of causes and effects to Him, / The world-producing Essence, who alone / Possesses being" (1730-52). Ultimately, scientific, philosophical, theologi- cal, and aesthetic insight are interdependent. The man who views creation "with brute unconscious gaze" fails to find both the Creator and the beauty of creation that "With transport touches all the springs of life" ("Hymn on the Seasons," lines 28-35). Scientific passages on hydrology, ethology, or climatology may not be to our poetic taste, but an interest in extending poetic imagination to aquifers, natural systems, and biotic environments should not be dismissed lightly by anyone in pursuit of ecological poetry. Thomson's combination of direct observation, scientific understanding, and philosophical meditation is new in English nature poetry. It is hard to see how it might mark a "return to earlier methods" or how it describes a "disenchanted" or "mechanical" world. An evaporation cycle might be considered mechanical in the sense that it can be analyzed into constituent parts and explained according to principles of physics, but such a "machine" is for Thomson life-supporting rather than life-denying, inspiring awe rather than authorizing exploitation.</page><page sequence="22">32 Religion &amp; Literature What "Romantic ecology" often seems to mean is not so much nature poetry as poetry about the nature of the poet. If it is the "environmental imagination," or even "deep ecology" we seek in earlier poetry let us tempo- rarily put down our Wordsworth and pick up our Thomson and Cowper and Pope. Deep ecology begins by questioning anthropocentrism in a manner consonant with An Essay on Man. Pope can imagine only the species-proud man believing that everything was created for him, murmuring absurdly to himself, "For me . . . For me . . . My foot-stool earth." Rereading Pope against the "Deep Ecology Platform" formulated by Arne Naess and the American ecologist William Sessions in 1984 helps bring the poem home to us without distorting it. Here are the first three of Naess's and Sessions' tenets: 1 . The flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth has intrinsic value. The value of non-human life forms is independent of the usefulness these may have for narrow human purposes. 2. Richness and diversity of life forms are values in themselves and contribute to the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth. 3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs. (Naess 29) With this orientation in mind we might also turn with fresh eyes to the closing book of William Cowper's The Task ( 1 785). There, Cowper celebrates what would now be called "biophilia," defined by biologist E.O. Wilson as an "innate tendency" to "love non-human life" (Wilson 1 34). For Cowper, such an affinity is a moral norm: The heart is hard in nature, and unfit For human fellowship, as being void Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike To love and friendship both, that is not pleased With sight of animals enjoying life, Nor feels their happiness augment his own. (VI. 321-26) Cowper accepts the pronouncement in Genesis that man shall have do- minion over the animals, but he anticipates many contemporary "Green Christians" in seeming to define dominion as stewardship, and he echoes less-cited verses from Exodus and Deuteronomy that imply strict limits on anthropocentrism. I will conclude here with another passage from the last book of The Task, in which Cowper sums up human obligations to the</page><page sequence="23">JOHN SITTER 33 animal creation, a kind of "people" who appear rather rarely in Romantic poetry. What we would call ecology Cowper calls the "oeconomy of nature's realm" (VI. 579). In these next lines the word "convenience" has more moral weight than our "ease" or saving of trouble, suggesting instead the now obsolete meanings of accordance with nature, ethical fitness, suitability, propriety:11 The sum is this: if man's convenience, health, Or safety interfere, his rights and claims Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs. Else they are all - the meanest things that are, As free to live and to enjoy that life, As God was free to form them at the first, Who in his sovereign wisdom made them all. (VI. 581-87) The italics are mine, but the emphasis is Cowper's. Without adopting "ecotheology" or "ecological theology" as descriptions of his project, James Gustafson in 1981 argued the need to escape anthro- pocentrism as cogently as any theologian of recent decades. In Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective Gustafson characterizes the dominant tendency of Christian theology as "Ptolemaic," an "anthropocentric, indeed egocentric" perspective in which "God is thought to exist and act almost exclusively for the benefit of man," a critique close to Pope's in An Essay on Man. Conven- tionally, theology's ethical questions have tended, Gustafson argues, to be species- and self-centered, but need not be: In terms of good or value the question is, usually, What is good for man? or What is of value to human beings? In terms of right or wrong it is, usually, What are the right relations between persons? Alternatives are these: What is good for the whole creation? What is good not only for man but for the natural world of which man is a part? What conduct is right for man not only in relation to other human beings but also in relation to the ordering of the natural and the social worlds? (Gustafson 1:88) Is a non-anthropoentric poetics - in which we might read The Seasons as responsively as The Prelude - as imaginatively stringent and demanding as a theocentric theology? Ours is a moment when a vigorous reconsideration of the traditions of nature poetry before Romanticism should help reanimate both literary and religious discussion.

E.g., Jurgen Moltmann, God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God (1985). Reviewing Moltmann's book, William C. French remarks on the "seismic shift" and "great sea change" between his earlier emphasis on history, eschatology, and the future and this work's emphasis on nature, creation, and the present (French 79, 81). 10. One of Popes earliest prose writings, Guardian #61 (May 21, 1713), is an essay against the mistreatment of animals. In one of his last recorded conversations with Joseph Spence (January, 1 744) he deplored the dissection of dogs by their mutual friend, the animal physiologist Dr. Stephen Hales, asking "how do we know that we have a right to kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?" When Spence said that he himself used to believe that dogs "had reason as well as we," Pope replied that "So they have, to be sure," and that "then they must have souls too, as unperishable in their nature as ours. And as our arguments from the actions of our souls must hold equally for them, if they have any such things as ideas or thoughts raised within them, where would be the harm to us in allowing them immortality too?" (Spence I. 1 18-19). Perhaps reluctant to seem too ecological in his reading of eighteenth-century poets, Hitt (2004) says "it would surely be misleading to imply that Thomson, had he lived today, would have been a card- carrying member of PETA" (127). Allowing for the poetic license of all such hypothetical time travel, I am not so sure, particularly if one specifies Pope. 1 1 . See OED #3 and #4.
