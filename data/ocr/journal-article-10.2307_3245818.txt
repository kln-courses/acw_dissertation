<plain_text><page sequence="1">PACIFIC DREAMS Currents of Surrealism and Fantasy in California Art Susan Ehrlich An exhibition organized by UCLA at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center urrealism served as a vital force in American art during the years that spanned the Depression and the Cold War. Open to personal inter- pretation and formal experimentation, it appealed to many American artists who welcomed its creative freedom and embraced its techniques for gaining access to the unconscious mind. In California a number of venturesome painters, sculptors, and photographers, paralleling their colleagues in other parts of the country, wrought new expressive syntheses beholden to the movement's probe of dream, myth, and illusion. The exhibition "Pacific Dreams" ex- plores the diverse manifestations of sur- realism in California art between 1934 and 1957, beginning with early re- sponses to European surrealism and con- cluding with collages, assemblages, and sculptural works that look forward to the beat sensibility of the late 1950s and the funk art of the 1960s. One of the most significant modernist movements, surrealism arose in Paris in 1924 from dada, whose libertinism it fused with ideas and techniques derived from Freudian psychology. The surreal- ists saw art as a means of freeing the creative unconscious, and their interest in dreams and fantasy found visual expression in both the biomorphic ab- stractions of Hans Arp, Max Ernst, Andre Masson, Joan Mir6, and Yves Tanguy and the illusionistic fantasies of Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte, and Paul Delvaux, among others. Yet, whether abstract or veristic, surrealism sought to merge, in poet Andre Breton's words, the "seemingly contradictory" states of "dream and reality. . . into . . . a surreality." POST-SURREALISM In 1934, Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundeberg formulated Post-Surrealism, one of the earliest American responses to European surrealism. They brought a classical sensibility to surrealism, reject- ing the Europeans' preoccupation with the nonrational in favor of a more cerebral approach. In the tradition of Giorgio de Chirico and Rend Magritte, the Post-Surrealists created illusionistic 72 -</page><page sequence="2">tableaux devoted to philosophical themes, which were imbued with the air of crystallized dreams. The artists often focused on the biological sphere, draw- ing parallels between procreation and creativity, and on developments in as- tronomy and physics. Indeed their works can be seen as a highly individual ex- pression of the American fascination with science and technology. In addi- tion to Feitelson and Lundeberg, the loosely formed Post-Surrealist group in- cluded Grace Clements, Philip Guston, Lucien Labaudt, Harold Lehman, and Knud Merrild. Although he was not a Post-Surrealist, Ben Berlin shared his colleagues' taste for enigmatic scenarios. MAGIC REALISM IN A FEMININE VEIN: DORR BOTHWELL AND GERRIE VON PRIBOSIC GUTMANN The work of Dorr Bothwell and Gerrie von Pribosic Gutmann, like that of Eugene Berman and the Post-Surreal- ists, belongs to a broad sphere of illu- sionistic fantasy loosely termed magic realism. A vein of art pioneered by Giorgio de Chirico, Rene Magritte, and others, magic realism courted enigma through startling conjunctions of com- monplace things. For many American artists of the 1930s and 1940s it offered a flexible means of conveying private ideation while retaining communicabil- ity. Bothwell's symbolist paintings give visual form to memories or ideas by presenting objects in unusual juxtaposi- tions against vast, simplified landscapes. Gutmann's work is more explicitly au- tobiographical. In images woven from fantasy and reality she expressed tur- moil within her psyche and a spiritual quest for an identity as a woman, an artist, and a mother. NEO-ROMANTICISM: EUGENE BERMAN Magic realism tinged with nostalgia char- acterizes the work of the Neo-Roman- tics, the group that Eugene Berman cofounded with his brother Leonid and their friends Christian Berard and Pavel Tchelitchew in Paris in the mid-1920s. Inspired by Picasso's Blue and Rose periods, the artists painted dreamlike scenes populated by melancholy figures. After Berman settled in Los Angeles in the early 1940s, his Neo-Romantic aes- thetic took on a new comeliness, appar- ently in response to his contact with Hollywood. His work also became more theatrical, perhaps as a result of his activity as a set designer. In the melo- dramatic paintings Berman made dur- ing World War II, symbolic muses pre- side over ravaged landscapes, bearing lonely witness to civilization's demise. ILLUSIONISTIC SURREALISM: SALVADOR DALI With his bizarre imagination, carefully cultivated image, and lifelong fascina- tion with film, Salvador Dali might have been a Hollywood creation. Al- though this quintessential surrealist was only an occasional visitor to Southern California, it was the film industry and its colorful characters that brought him there. He first visited Los Angeles in 1937 to collaborate with Harpo Marx on a movie script. Although the film did not come to fruition, the visit gave Dali an opportunity to render portraits of Harpo and Groucho Marx. During the 1940s Dali summered regularly at Pebble Beach and worked on two films in Southern California. In 1944 he created a dream sequence for Alfred EHRLICH / Pacific Dreams * 73</page><page sequence="3">Man Ray, Frosted Objects (of My Affection), 1946. Rayograph, 1315/16 10'/16".

The latter movie, which was never realized, was to have com- bined live action with animated charac- ters and settings. While working on the project, Dali began a portrait of studio chief Jack Warner, which was com- pleted several years later. HOLLYWOOD PHOTOGRAPHIC ILLUSIONS: WILLIAM MORTENSEN AND WILL CONNELL During the 1930s many photographers were attracted to Hollywood, which not only offered employment but also served as the source of a new aesthetic. They discovered that many of the basic ele- ments of cinematography-narrative, montage, the staging of fictional or historical events, theatrical lighting- could be used to great effect in still photography. Rejecting the purist aes- thetic embraced by many of their con- temporaries, these photographers used multiple printing and other experimen- tal darkroom techniques to develop dra- matic fictional narratives. William Mortensen, who had worked extensively in the film industry (notably with Cecil B. DeMille), used the theat- rical potential of the studio and the reconstructive possibilities of the dark- room to create a highly distinctive, if sometimes uneasy, cross-breeding of tra- ditional pictorial photography and Hol- lywood magic. Will Connell, a Holly- wood hand with a background in commercial photography, wielded the various elements of photography and cinematography as tools rather than ends in themselves. The photographs by Connell in the exhibition are from his 1937 book In Pictures, a satirically hu- morous expose of Hollywood in which he made exaggerated use of dramatic lighting and close-ups both to parody and to pay homage to the film industry. PHOTOGRAPHIC METAPHOR AND MAGIC REALISM Not immune to the allure of surrealism, a number of West Coast photographers tapped the mystery inherent in every- day things. While their styles and ap- proaches varied, all of the artists repre- sented here created works that question the notion of photographic "truth." Ruth Bernhard understood how to bring out the macabre aspect of seemingly innocuous playthings. In her disquiet- ing tableaux of the 1930s and 1940s, which often featured puppets and dolls, unlikely combinations of things, dis- parities of scale, and unusual lighting are all skillfully utilized to make the familiar seem unfamiliar. Even purist Edward Weston, one of Bernhard's early mentors, responded to the suggestive power that dolls possess, as his image of mannequins on the MGM studio lot demonstrates. He also created other works that capitalize on chance, displacement, and transmog- rification. His portraits of a nude wear- ing a gas mask, for example, reveal a surreal creature, half human, half extra- terrestrial vamp. With the quick eye of a photojournalist, German emigre John Gutmann cap- tured the strangeness that lurked in San Francisco's environs. While he discov- ered many of his subjects by chance, EHRLICH / Pacific Dreams * 77</page><page sequence="7">Gutmann also composed scenes for the camera, for example, his portraits of his troubled wife, Gerrie, and her doll. These images exemplify the surrealist interest in stand-ins for the human figure. Like Weston, Minor White subscribed to the ethos of straight photography, which he also stretched at times to accommodate magic and metaphor. His nudes share surrealism's mix of eroti- cism and psychic disruption, while his images of industrial objects seize surre- alistically on the allusive potential of the man-made. Rose Mandel studied with White, and they had a common interest in psychol- ogy. But On Walls and behind Glass, her series of unmanipulated single-ex- posure images of odd reflections and unexpected juxtapositions-with its re- curring use of eyes, hands, and clocks- is clearly heir to the European surrealist tradition of Eugene Atget, Herbert Bayer, and Salvador Dali. Through his manipulations of negatives and prints, Edmund Teske succeeded in making the measurement and passage of time the chief subject of his photo- graphs. His composite images conflate the historical past with the eternal present and resonate with ideas from psychology and mysticism. DADA-SURREALISM: MAN RAY, BEATRICE WOOD AND CLAY SPOHN A precursor of surrealism, dada was an irreverent, anti-authoritarian movement that emerged in several European cities and in New York during the years sur- rounding World War I. Man Ray, Beatrice Wood, and their friend Marcel Duchamp figured prominently in the New York dada movement, which rev- eled in humor, chance, and linguistic games. Having participated for two de- cades in dada-surrealist circles in Paris, Man Ray arrived in Los Angeles in 1940. Conceived with wit and imagina- tion, his California paintings, construc- tions, and photographs express a delight in the frisson that commonplace objects can yield when brought into novel com- binations. Typically they capitalize on verbal-visual puns and seek to efface the boundary between art and life, high aesthetics and popular culture. In the 1920s Wood settled in Los Ange- les, where she established a career as a respected ceramicist known for her lu- minous lusterware. She also created faux- naif drawings, collages, and clay figu- rines that-in their whimsical humor, devotion to play, and sly controversion of social mores-evince a dada-surreal- ist spirit. A Bay Area artist and teacher, Clay Spohn seized on dada-surrealism's fu- sions of man and machine and its re- demption of junk. Prompted by night- mares he had about World War II, his Guerrographs depict scenes of bizarre military contraptions and armored warriors waging battle on otherworldly terrains. His Precious Objects, which hon- ors debased items through recontext- ualization, appeared with other bizarre oddments in the installation The Mu- seum of Unknown and Little Known Objects, which he organized at the Cali- fornia School of Fine Arts in 1949. 78 * PERFORMING ARTS JOURNAL 52</page><page sequence="8">ABSTRACT SURREALISM IN THE 1940s With the advent of World War II, whose horrors defied representation, and with the immigration of European mod- ernists to the United States, surrealist abstraction assumed increasing promi- nence in American art during the 1940s. At once universal and personal, it en- abled artists to pursue formal innova- tion while heeding private fantasy. In Southern California Lorser Feitelson, provoked by the terrors of the war and the political tensions left in its wake, fashioned the evocative figurations that he called Magical Forms. Echoes of Jean Arp, Max Ernst, and Yves Tanguy coa- lesced in these ominous beings, which embodied the psychic duress of a holocaustal age. Knud Merrild and Hans Burkhardt also created organic abstrac- tions, but theirs depended on an expres- sive painterliness. Merrild's flux paint- ings, made with automatic techniques, predated Jackson Pollock's drip paint- ings by five years. In the Bay Area brothers Charles and Robert Howard along with Madge Knight and Adaline Kent (their respec- tive wives) created paintings and sculp- tures in which organic fantasy is wed to constructivist form. Jeremy Anderson shared the anthropomorphic wit of Rob- ert Howard, with whom he had studied at the California School of Fine Arts. His wood sculptures have a mysterious presence, and their phallic projections and glandular spheres create an erotic subtext. Claire Falkenstein's work like- wise draws upon the surreal in its biomorphic sensuality and its use of found objects. THE DYNATON During the postwar years surrealist ab- straction gained further momentum with the formation of the Dynaton group, which consisted of former European surrealists Wolfgang Paalen and Gor- don Onslow Ford and American artist Lee Mullican. The name Dynaton- derived from the Greek word "dyn," meaning "possible"-suggested an open- ended approach and exploration of creativity's boundless potential. To the surrealist interest in the subconscious and in automatist methods of probing its contents, the Dynaton artists joined a regard for Native American art, meta- physics, and science. Meditative in their approach, the Dynaton painters created contemplative works that reflected their desire to achieve oneness with nature and the universe. In Paalen's "mosaic" paintings heraldic figures shimmer like jewels; in Onslow Ford's works space, time, and the elements meld; and in Mullican's canvases painstakingly crafted fields seethe with electric energy. The synergy that had buoyed the Dynaton venture could not sustain itself indefi- nitely, and following a major exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1951, the three artists parted ways and pursued independent careers. FROM SURREALIST POETICS TO THE ETHOS OF THE BEATS Harbingers of a new sensibility, Jess, Gordon Wagner, and Wallace Berman linked the ethos of surrealism to that of a rising alternative culture. A former radiochemist, Jess turned to surrealistic expression in 1952 after encountering Max Ernst's collage book Une semaine de bonte. His remarkable paste-ups, EHRLICH / Pacific Dreams * 79</page><page sequence="9">painstakingly crafted collages of images culled from discarded books, magazines, and engravings, exploit surrealist double entendres and encompass an extraordi- nary expressive range-from sensual ro- manticism to raucous dada humor. In the 1950s in Southern California and the Bay Area, many artists com- bined the traditions of European mod- ernism with commonplace practices of beachcombing, tinkering, and building "contraptions" and kinetic assemblages. The assemblages of Gordon Wagner, a pioneer of this movement, acknowledge a debt to surrealism in their reclama- tions of discarded items and in their figural metamorphoses. A seminal figure in California art his- tory, Wallace Berman is best known for his compelling assemblages and Verifax photo-collages. A series of drawings that he made of celebrities in the 1940s take delight in surrealistic absurdities even as they look forward to the new sensibility of the beats.
