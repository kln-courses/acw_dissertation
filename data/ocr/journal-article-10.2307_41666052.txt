THE EL MOLLE CULTURE OF CHILE The ley discovery of Elqui only of the eighteen culture years of El ago Molle introduced in the Val- a ley of Elqui only eighteen years ago introduced a new factor into the study of the prehistoric peoples of Chile. The remains found by the author (in 1938) in six cemeteries around the little town of El Molle - which gave its name to the culture - revealed a people probably having Amazonian affiliations, a people who used tern- it etãs (lip ornaments) and stone pipes characterized by two horizontal arms and a vertical central bowl. Their pottery consists principally of small jars with flat bases, generally without handles - gray, brown, black or occasionally red in color. Some are thin-walled and carefully burnished, while others are coarse, for cooking. The El Molle people were also able to work copper into small ornaments such as bracelets, rings and ear pendants. One interesting anthropological characteristic is that the majority of the skulls had thick walls, up to ten or eleven millimeters in thickness. These are the principal characteristics of the culture known from the cemeteries in the vicinity of El Molle ; we shall now give details regarding this culture, which developed and spread over almost all of Chile. The term Molle I is applied to the cultural stage represented by the cemeteries of El Molle and related sites. A more advanced stage of the culture has been named Molle 11.

In the center is a geometric figure formed of similar stones, or sometimes merely a heap of these stones to- gether with some larger flat ones. These stones were buried, with only a few visible above the surface. The graves lie at a depth of about two meters and are filled with white river stones and earth (Figure 2). Sometimes a layer of large flat stones is found above the burial or in the fill. Pottery is relatively scarce in the El Molle cemeteries (Figure 3). Painted and incised ware is lacking except for some beginnings of this more advanced stage, which was later found in a cemetery in the valley of Hurtado, a 201</page><page sequence="3">4.

The typical lip ornaments, tembetás , or labrets, found in the El Molle cemeteries are of various forms, short and discoid, or long and bottle-shaped (Figure 5). The ma- terial also varies: it may be opal, jasper, onyx, porphyritic tufa or other stone. The pipes (Figure 6) are of similar materials. Various metal objects were found in the El Molle cemeteries, such as rectangular plaques which were evi- dently ear pendants; one pair of these has a decoration of impressed points. The other metal objects are bracelets and a ring, plain bands of copper open and rounded at the ends, curved to fit the wrist or finger. The same culture has been found in some parts of the Province of Atacama. In the Valley of Huasco burials were usually made, it seems, in tumuli, or mounds. Exca- vation in these mounds resulted in the discovery of tem- betás, stone smoking pipes, copper objects, and some potsherds indicating the same culture as that of El Molle. Molle II: Early in 1955 cemeteries of the El Molle culture were discovered in the valley of the Hurtado River. Don Jorge Iribarren Ch., Archaeologist of the Museo Arqueológico of La Serena, took part in these excavations. Thanks to him we have detailed notes on the work, and the finds are now in this museum. The objects found in graves of the Hurtado Valley evidently belong to a more advanced cultural stage of these people. In the El Molle cemeteries pottery is scarce. Some vessels are well polished, grayish red or black, but only two show any attempt at decoration and zoomorphic stylization (Figure 4). In the Hurtado cemetery, on the other hand, many more pottery vessels were found in this relatively small area than in the six cemeteries of El Molle. The Hurtado pottery is enriched with new forms and bears incised decoration, or is painted in red and black (Figures 7-9). Great cultural progress is shown also in the metal ob- jects found among the funerary furniture of Hurtado. In addition to copper objects like those from El Molle, some plaques of gold and silver were excavated, as well as some 203</page><page sequence="5">7.

The gold plaques are circular and very thin : one of them bears an impressed or repoussé decoration showing seven serpent forms with some geometric ele- ments (Figure 10). Among the new ceramic types incised or engraved dec- oration appears, as well as decoration in red and white painted with a sureness of technique that indicates a long period of development. The incised decoration consists of simple motifs applied with great care, some potsherds having incised lines emphasized in white, thus making the design stand out from the polished black surface of the vessel. The painted decoration consists mainly of step motifs painted in red over a white base. In both types, the incised and the painted, appears a curious design which seems to be a zoomorphic stylization combined with a characteristic step design (Figures 7, center, and 8). In the Hurtado material there are great innovations in ceramic forms. Pitchers which at first glance resemble Peruvian huacos are conspicuous. The lower part of these pitchers is like an inverted, truncated cone; above, they are rounded, with a hollow bridge-handle from which extend twin spouts, one open, the other with small holes like a colander. Two of these pitchers are polished black ; another has a creamy white surface on which is painted in red a stylized zoomorphic motif in a stepped pattern (Figure 7, center). Another unusual and beautiful little pitcher has a trun- cated cone base and a bridge-handle but only a single spout (Figure 7, right). A red pottery pitcher merits special note as being the only stylized anthropomorphic effigy vessel known from this culture (Figure 7, left). Among the objects found at Hurtado the tembetá, or labret, the typical lip ornament of the Indians of this cul- ture, is naturally to be found. Ten examples of various forms have been found, made of semiprecious stones, among them the form typical of El Molle, long and thin, extending 5-7 cm. beyond the lower lip. Stone smoking pipes, characteristic of the El Molle culture, have not been found here. It is hardly credible that the practice of smoking could have been abandoned. Since at El Molle the pipes were always found apart from the other grave offerings, it is more likely that they have merely been missed in the excavations at Hurtado. Pos- sibly, however, the pipes in this region were made of perishable material such as wood, because of the lack of 204</page><page sequence="6">8.

In the cemetery newly discovered at Hurtado, whose mortuary furniture we have briefly described, the cultural progress evinced may be too great to attribute solely to local development; more likely it was due to influences from neighboring cultures. Such foreign influences must have persisted through a long period of time in order to become mingled with the customs and activities of this people, and must have left their mark wherever this peo- ple lived. We believe, therefore, that many of their ceme- teries have not yet been discovered and that they will probably be found in Andean or pre-Cordilleran regions like the town of Hurtado, more than a thousand meters above sea level. Primitive Coastal Molle: The same culture is found on the coast, but the accompanying grave objects are poorer in quality. In this area have been found only short discoidal tembetás, stone pipes made of a white calcareous stone and some copper ornaments. The pottery is very scarce and mainly utilitarian. In general, judging by the contents of the graves, the stage of culture is poorer even than that shown by the cemeteries of El Molle. 205</page></plain_text>
