<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTOLOGICALCHRISTOLOGICAL IDEAS IN THE GREEK COMMENTARIES ON THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS' κ ALTHOUGH this paper deals with exegetical material, its main f-\ concern is not with problems of exegesis. The degree to which J- A-the commentators understood and expounded the Christology of the Epistle to the Hebrews itself, is an issue to which I shall only allude in passing. My purpose is rather to use these commentaries to illustrate classic and well-known Christological positions, to elucidate the presuppositions which lie behind them, and the problems and concerns which gave rise to them; then briefly to relate the conclusions to modern Christological debate. First, a brief survey of the material to be used: I shall ignore the large collections of commentary on this Epistle collected in the ninth and tenth centuries2 and concentrate on what survives from the period immediately preceding Chalcedon. The works with which we shall be concerned are Chrysostom's Homilies on Hebrews,3 the Commentary of Theodoret,4 and the fragments of exegesis by Cyril of Alexandria5 and Theodore of Mopsuestia6 which can be extracted from the Catenae. The main point of interest is the difference in exegesis of the Epistle by those representing the Antiochene and Alexandrian schools. The Antiochenes are well represented by Chrysostom, Theodore, and Theodoret, while for the Alexandrians we have to rely on Cyril's fragments; but there is sufficient material for the difference in treatment of certain Christo logical themes to be apparent. Cyril and Theodoret were in fact on opposite sides of the Nestorian controversy, and in their Commentaries we find their respective Christologies expressed far more explicitly than in the earlier Homilies of Chrysostom, but his preaching clearly presup poses the Antiochene approach. In this paper then I shall be illustrating 1 The original draft of this paper was presented to Professor Moule's Seminar at the Divinity School of the University of Cambridge.

The presupposition of all our commentators is the Nicene faith. Any over-all consideration of the use of Hebrews in the Fathers would draw particular attention to their constant reference to Heb. i. 3: δς ων απαύγασμα απαύγασμα της δόξης καϊ χαρακτηρ της υποστάσεως αύτοΰ as a proof-text against the Arians. Athanasius' writings are saturated with reference to it. It is interesting to note that Theodoret says in his commentary that the Arians rejected the Epistle from the canon because of this text.1 All the commentators use chapter i to prove against the Arians that Christ is greater than the angels and is in fact ομοούσιος τω Πατρί. All heretics who do not understand this formula correctly, Sabellians along with Arians, are suitably dealt with. The reason why I draw attention to this fact, is that it is commitment to this basic Nicene faith which raises the Christological problem most acutely. The Sabellians were hated because of the implication that the Father suffered, but once the homoousion was accepted, the possibility of the Son's suffering and Incarnation became equally problematical. Right at the beginning, the commentaries are committed to an understanding of the divine nature of Christ which can hardly be reconciled with what the Epistle later says about his suffering, temptation, and learning by obedience. Commentators in both schools of Christological thought found them selves obliged to draw a distinction between the essential nature of the Son of God and things that are said about his humanity or his situation in the Incarnation. Neither side would compromise the Nicene position of the Λόγος άτρεπτος. So Theodoret, in a passage that we shall examine later, remarks that it is necessary to know which names apply to the θεολογία θεολογία and which to the οικονομία ;2 Chrysostom not merely ascribes suffering and temptation to the Manhood, but also priesthood and intercession, pointing out that these ministering functions are exercised κατά κατά σάρκα, as part of his άνθρωπότης, of his loving humiliation in the οικονομία,οικονομία, and that they are not to be confused with his sitting at God's right hand in judgement which is της αξίας τοϋ θεοΰ ;3 Cyril from the opposing school echoes this idea when he says: At the same time he acts as priest ανθρωπίνως in that he has become man, and sits in authority θεϊκωςθεϊκως in that he remains Logos.4 This distinction between the natures can be further illustrated by their comments on Heb. iii. 1: Chrysostom remarks that the comparison with Moses is possible only because the author is speaking of Christ's human qualities and not about his 1 Migne, P.G. 82. 681c. 2 Ibid. 708c. 3 Migne, P.G. 63. 106, hi. 4 Migne, P.G. 74. 972B; Pusey, p. 468.</page><page sequence="3">152 FRANCES Μ. YOUNG Godhead ;י Theodoret explains that he is High Priest and Apostle as Man —if he had been such as God he would have been such before the Incarnation, but it was in the Incarnation that he was sent (here, of course, he uses the verb from which Apostle is derived) \2 Cyril attacks those heretics who on the basis of this text claim that Christ cannot be ομοούσιος,ομοούσιος, and explains that it is only said about the Incarnation.3 However, it is immediately clear that Cyril did not in fact mean the same thing as the Antiochenes by this distinction between the natures, for he goes on to explain that in the Incarnation the Logos, though remaining God in his essential nature, became σάρξ, that is, a man with a soul and a mind. He insists that he is priest and God at the same time. He consistently speaks of the pre-Incarnation Logos and the post Incarnation Logos, not of a distinction between the Logos and the Man. So although he can make exegetical statements which appear almost identical with those of Chrysostom and Theodoret, his approach is quite different. This is made more explicit in his comments on Heb. i. 8:4 while insisting that the anointing only applies to the Incarna tion situation, he explains, 'though he remained as he was when he became man, by the anointing of manhood with Godhead he united creation to himself and made both ev—one thing'. Thus even as he makes the distinction between what can be said of the Son's divine nature and what can be said of him in the context of the Incarnation, Cyril hastens to safeguard the unity of Christ's person. So while admitting at the outset that both sides had the same Christo logical problem and made a similar distinction between the natures as a result of a common need to safeguard the homoousion, we already find that this distinction is not exactly the same distinction. From this point, we shall proceed to elaborate the Christological position implicit in Cyril's commentary, and then later turn to the contrasting exegesis of corresponding passages in the work of the Antiochene commentators. One passage which shows up differences in Christology very well is Heb. ii. 6-18. All the commentators agree that the passage from Ps. viii applies best to Christ although the Psalmist intended it of ordinary human nature. For Cyril5 the passage tells of the κενωσις of the Logos who took a body which was liable to death, and suffered so as to destroy death and raise humanity to immortality. We were dishonoured by Adam's fault; we were glorified by Christ's obedience on our behalf. The taking of human nature by the Logos produced a true unity, which was 1 Migne, P.G. 63. 48-9. 2 Migne, P.G. 82. 697B. 3 Migne, P.G. 74. 969B; Pusey, p. 466. 4 Ibid. 961B; Pusey, p. 462; cf. p. 401. 5 Ibid. 964A-9A; Pusey, pp. 463-6.</page><page sequence="4">IDEAS IN GREEK COMMENTARIES ON HEBREWS 153 not brought about by any change in the divinity which is άτρεπτος. The Son remained God when he took the body and his unity of person can be understood by the analogy of the unity of body and soul in a human person. This is clearly a dangerous analogy. It is well known that the result of the Alexandrian approach to Christology was inevitably to submerge the humanity of Jesus into the dominating role of the divine Logos. The extreme of this position had already been condemned in Apollinarius who claimed that in the case of Christ, the Logos replaced the human soul—meaning by this the human decision-making ego. Hence Cyril's need to explain, as he frequently does in his commentary, that the σάρξ assumed by the Logos was a man with a soul and a mind; but his use of this analogy shows that he has not fully grasped the implications of the condemnation of Apollinarius and still moves in the same general pattern of thought. But the most important point that arises from this passage is the close link between Cyril's Christology and his soteriology. His Christo logy is determined by what he regarded as necessary for salvation. Here is a selection of sentences from his commentary at this point: He shared our flesh and blood in order to overcome death which was the result of sin. Man could not be justified according to law; he had to be rescued from the curse. So, as High Priest, the Logos made expiation for our sins according to the power of his divinity. (Note this very important phrase.) Human nature was seen to be healthy in Christ, and this faultlessness saved those on earth. Those who shared his nature, he linked to God the Father through himself. Behind Cyril's remarks lies Athanasius' understanding of salvation whereby sin and death are dealt with through the perfect life and sacrificial death of the Son of God and man is re-endowed with the lost image of God and raised to divinity (θεοποίησις).(θεοποίησις). For both Alexandrian bishops this salvation could be accomplished only by the power of God himself. It was this soteriological principle which had stimulated Athanasius to spend his life opposing the Arians and establishing that the Logos must be ομοούσιος and ατρΐπτος·, it was this that lay behind the Christological tradition which Cyril represents. Only if the Logos is ατρΐπτος and in principle unable to succumb to sin is the salvation of mankind assured. So, Cyril goes so far as to state explicitly when commenting on Heb. vii. 271 that as God he was stronger than sin, he could not sin, and hence the superiority of his priesthood and sacrifice to that of the Jews. Cyril had to safeguard the permanence and surety of his salvation by ascribing it entirely to the power of God overcoming the weakness and sin of humanity. He stresses 1 Ibid. 976B-C. Pusey attributes the passage to the Tractatus de R. Fide ad Reg. Cf. pp. 402 and 406 n.</page><page sequence="5">154 FRANCES Μ. YOUNG over and over again that the Logos is not changed by the Incarnation but unites humanity to his divinity so healing it and raising it to heaven to be presented purified to the Father as a sweet-smelling offering.1 In the light of this we should expect that Cyril would fail to give full weight to what Hebrews says about the human conflicts, temptations, and sufferings of Christ, and an examination of the few surviving passages that deal with this aspect of the Epistle's teaching confirms this view. On the final verse of chapter ii,2 he makes no use of the idea of Christ undergoing temptation during his life and thus being able to help the tempted from his own experience; rather he identifies the temptation with his suffering on the Cross, and indicates that it helps the weak and tempted because it is part of the sacrifice by which human nature was perfected. As we have already seen Cyril believed that this sacrifice dealt with the human problem because it was made according to the power of his divinity. The conquest of temptation is thus the automatic result of God's power dealing with the weakness of human nature. Nor does Cyril allow full weight to what the Epistle says about Christ's being sympathetic to human problems because he has acquired personal knowledge of them through involvement in the Incarnation. On ii. 173 he begins by saying: He is like us in being our brother in flesh and blood, through being in the form of a servant. He became our faithful High Priest in the Incarnation. But having stated this, he goes on to inquire: How can this be? Was he not merciful before ? Did the Logos of God progress and become better than himself when he took the seed of Abraham ?... How then was he άτρΐπτος in nature if he became what he was not ? How did he empty himself and bring himself low if he became better than himself? No, he was always merciful. He became priest when he took the seed of Abraham to save us.us. .. . In other words Cyril allows the Logos to humiliate himself and assume human nature (κένωσις frequently appears in his commentary), as long as by this it is not implied that he improved himself in any way. The Incarnation could not bring about any change in the Logos; still less could it in any sense make him better. This position is both upheld and undermined by his remarks on iv. 15.4 (In the following quotation, temptation and experience translate the same Greek root): Even if the Logos of God had not become man, he would have known human 1 Migne, P.G. 74. 977A-B, 985C-D, 988C-D.

But since he put on our flesh, he has been tempted in all points; we do not say that he was ignorant, but that, with a pre-existing knowledge proper to divinity, it came about that he learned also by experience. But he did not become συμπαθής συμπαθής from having had experience—he was already merciful by nature and is so as God. But after being what he is, he also became a man amongst us and for this reason this is said about him. Cyril does his best to do justice to what the Epistle says about Christ's experience or temptation, but his presuppositions make it very difficult for him. He does not want to say that the Logos improved, or added to his knowledge of and sympathy with the human condition; yet he cannot repudiate what the Epistle says, especially since he recognizes the psychological value of an appeal to Christ's experience of a human life. The Logos's changeless experience of or involvement in the human condition, while essential to Cyril's soteriology, is extremely difficult to envisage, and Cyril, while not admitting it, has found himself in a quandary. All this contrasts strongly with the very rich development in the Antiochene commentaries of the theme of Christ's human achievement of obedience by progress through temptation and suffering. It is true that Cyril may have said more about this aspect of the Epistle's teaching; his commentary only survives in fragmentary form. But from the hints we have looked at, we may guess that he did not elaborate this further than he was forced to by the text. If we return to Heb. ii. 6-18, we find that in contrast to Cyril's dominant interest in the conquest of human weakness by the power of God, the Antiochene commentators con centrate on the exemplary value of the Saviour's own conquest of human weakness, temptation, and suffering. It is in Chrysostom's Homilies that we have the most elaborate descriptions of Christ's human struggle and triumph, used, of course, as an exhortation to the congregation to emulate him. His crowning with glory and honour in ii. 91 is interpreted as a reminder of the Cross, showing his love and persuading the Epistle's readers to bear all things nobly, looking to their Teacher. His tasting of death is illuminated by comparison with a doctor who, though he has no need, tastes what has been prepared for his patient in order to persuade the sick man to have courage and face his food. This may seem a rather pedestrian analogy, but in this and his later treatment of Christ as an athlete and pioneer, Chrysostom concentrates on the exemplary nature of his work of sal vation. He goes so far as to identify sufferings with perfection and the cause of salvation, and, with the Epistle, indicates that Christ leads the way for others to follow. Later in the Homily he turns to a direct attack For the following discussion see Horn, iv (Migne, P.G. 63. 39-42 especially).</page><page sequence="7">156 FRANCES Μ. YOUNG on Docetists. The reality of our salvation depends on the reality of his identification with us in conflict with suffering, death, and the devil. Christ's work of salvation involved the achievement of victory over the masters who had held men in bondage, the victorious recapitulation of Adam's fatal path. Christ is glorified by suffering and the devil's tyranny is broken because by looking to Christ's pioneering work, men are delivered from fear of death. Already we can see the extent of the difference between Cyril's interpretation and that of Chrysostom. Both consistently attribute salvation to the love and goodness of God, but one concentrates on the invincible activity of divine power, the injection of divinity into humanity, and the other on the exemplary power of human suffering and the achievement of a human victory over sin. Each Christological emphasis is clearly determined by soteriological concerns. In the following Homily,1 Chrysostom proceeds to ii. 17-18. Where Cyril, as we have seen, is moved to safeguard the impossibility of the Logos progressing or changing, Chrysostom expands Christ's identifies tion with us in all things—he was born, nursed, grew, suffered all that he had to, and finally died; as our brother, he knows not only as God but also has come to know as man through the experience of temptation; he is συμπαθής because he suffered much.2 (Note how much more satis factory is his exegesis of the Epistle's words.) Later he adds that since the majority consider that experience is a more reliable way of acquiring knowledge, the author wants to show that having suffered, he knows what human nature suffers.3 Clearly he takes the idea of knowledge through experience considerably more seriously than Cyril. It is hardly surprising to find that the same emphasis appears again in his comments on iv. 15:4 Christ is not ignorant of our position, like many High Priests who have no idea what affliction is. For it is impossible for men to know the misfortune of the oppressed without experiencing it. Our High Priest has withstood all things so that he could have sympathy. He was persecuted, spat upon, condemned, mocked, had false witnesses brought against him, was driven out, and finally crucified. The phrase καθ'καθ' ομοιότητα χωρίς αμαρτίας indicates that it is possible to endure with out sin, even in the midst of afflictions; for in nature his flesh was the same as ours, though in sin no longer the same. Here Chrysostom concentrates on only one aspect of Christ's experience, namely the experience of persecution and rejection, but we see immediately the reason for his emphasis on the idea of Christ actually experiencing the human condition. It is not merely that knowledge acquired by experience is more reliable and therefore essential for his work as a sympathetic 1 Horn, ν (Migne, P.G. 63. 45 ff.). 2 Migne, P.G. 63. 47-8. 3 Ibid. 50. 4 Ibid. 63.</page><page sequence="8">IDEAS IN GREEK COMMENTARIES ON HEBREWS 157 High Priest, but that the reality of his experience is essential for his victory over evil to be relevant to men. He has shown that it is possible for a man to go through everything without sin, and that is why Chryso stom can exhort his congregation to emulate him. This insistence on Christ's being without sin in spite of being human contrasts with Cyril's view that he could not sin because he was the Λόγος άτρεπτος, but clearly it is likewise based on what was regarded as soteriologically necessary. However, we must not overlook the fact that in his comments earlier on ii. 18, Chrysostom had found himself obliged to answer in an aside the objection that God is απαθής.1 He is aware that his emphasis on Christ's human experience and suffering endangers the Nicene theology. He replies that the flesh of Christ suffered, and so he knows what it is like like no less than we do. This is the kind of unsatisfactory statement to which both schools of Christological thought were driven by their acceptance of the Nicene faith, but whereas Cyril in his anxiety to preserve the unity of the Christ, tended to underplay the suffering apart from the physical aspects which he could attribute to the flesh alone, Chrysostom emphasizes his experience of the human condition to such an extent that he is obliged to separate the Logos from it; this is the only way he knows of safeguarding both the reality of Christ's human involvement, and the divine nature of the Logos. We find this position more explicitly expressed in Theodoret who says on Heb. ii. 17-182 that he learned the weakness of human nature by experience, but hastens to explain that this is said about his human nature. For he was our High Priest not as God, but as Man; nor did he suffer as God, but as Man; nor as God did he learn our condition by experience, for he knows everything clearly as God and Creator. On Heb. iv. 14,3 he warns his readers that it is necessary to know what pertains to the βιολογία βιολογία and what to the οικονομία; and having prepared us in this way goes on to say on v. 15 that the author encourages the believers of that time who were subject to persecutions, by teaching that our High Priest not only knows the weakness of our nature as God, but also received experience of our sufferings as Man, remaining uninitiated only in sin. Since he understands our nature in this way, he can give us suitable help. He wants to say that the Christ knows our weakness both as God and as Man, but in order to preserve the essential nature of his Divinity and his Humanity, he makes provisos which tend to undermine the unity of the Christ. Just as Cyril's Christology was soteriologically based, so also was the Antiochenes' emphasis on the reality of Christ's human experience and conflict. But they were as anxious as he was to preserve the Nicene faith י Ibid. 48. 2 Migne, P.G. 82. 696c. 3 Ibid. 708C-D.</page><page sequence="9">158 FRANCES Μ. YOUNG in the απαθής and άτρεπτος nature of the Logos. So, instead of com promising the human progress and achievement of the Christ, they failed to give an adequate account of the unity of his person. For them, the two natures were equally necessary to guarantee salvation, and they were terrified of any Christology which seemed to compromise either by mixing them together; they had to be kept unalloyed, and therefore any real connection between them was mistrusted. Thus their division of the natures became so acute that the possibility of speaking of an Incarnation of the Logos looks less and less realistic. As we have seen, this Christological position is not spelt out quite clearly in Chrysostom's Homilies, but is more explicit in the Commentary of Theodoret. The most extreme statement of this division of the natures is to be found in a fragment of the commentary of Theodore of Mopsu estia, where he discusses the textual problem in Heb. ii. 9-10:1 should we read χάριτι Θεοΰ or χωρίς Θεοΰ ? He argues that χάριτι Θεοΰ was introduced for dogmatic reasons by copyists who could not imagine how Paul (the assumed author) could have said χωρίς Θεοΰ; he proves that χάριτι Θεοΰ is not suitable to the context and supports this by reference to other uses of χάρις in Paul. Then he explains that the Godhead of Christ is not compromised by the words χωρίς Θεοΰ when they are used in relation to his death. His suffering was not proper to his Godhead. What was proper to the Logos was his action in displaying as perfected through sufferings the pioneer of everyone's salvation, the Man that he took. Theodore thus asserts that the divine nature did not suffer, is απαθής and άτρεπτος, and at the same time preserves the possibility of the human Jesus becoming perfect, progressing, learning through the sufferings he endures and so on, by indicating that he suffered death χωρίς Θεοΰ. The person is divided but the real humanity given the chance to prove itself without being overridden by the all embracing power of the Divinity. Before posing some of the questions raised by aspects of this Christo logical difference, I propose to indicate some of the effects that each Christological position has on the exegesis of other themes in the Epistle. (i) The interpretation of the sacrifice of Christ Chrysostom speaks of sacrifice dealing with sin, and in many passages does not inquire how it cleanses mankind. However, various passages indicate that he assumed that the Father was angry and was propitiated by the sacrifice offered by our High Priest and Mediator, Jesus Christ.2 1 Staab, op. cit., p. 204. 2 e.g. Migne, P.G. 63. 123 et al. loc.</page><page sequence="10">IDEAS IN GREEK COMMENTARIES ON HEBREWS 159 This position is mitigated by his constant attribution of our salvation to God's φιλανθρωπία, and by some interesting comments in Horn. !1:ך (1) when describing Christ appearing on our behalf before the Father with a sacrifice able to propitiate him, he interjects—'not that he was hostile; it was the angels who were hostile'; (2) in discussing 'he bore our sins', he states that Christ took sins from men and bore them to the Father, not so that the Father could make any judgement on them, but so that he could forgive them. Later he comments on els αθίτησιν της αμαρτίας αμαρτίας saying that this means despising of sin which no longer has any παρρησία ('self-assertion' is perhaps the best translation). It suffered violence, he explains, because it should have been punished and was not; its forgiveness destroyed its power. These hints show that Chyso stom wants to attribute salvation to the love of God dealing with sin, and yet he assumes that the sacrifice offered by the Man, Christ, propitiates the wrath of God, the Father. Father and Son are apparently divided, but since he consistently speaks of the High Priesthood of Christ being a function of his Manhood, while his sitting on the throne of judge ment is a function of his Divinity, the implication is an uncomfortable division between God and Man within the Person of Christ himself. Theodoret explicitly states that this is so: as Man he offered the sacrifice in which he was both priest and victim; as God he received it.2 Cyril on the other hand, regards the sacrifice as an act performed by the power of divinity to heal mankind, and describes how the same person receives, gives, and is the sacrifice whereby mankind is purified, raised to heaven, and offered to the Father as an όσμη evwSias.3 The unity of the Godhead and the Person of Christ is not impaired by his understanding of atoning sacrifice. (ii) The eternal intercession of Christ It is not merely in explaining the problems of the Incarnation that we can see differences in treatment between the Antiochenes and the Alexandrians. The differences persist in discussion of the Risen and Ascended Lord, since both sides agree that the human nature of the Christ has ascended and continues in heaven. Cyril's position here is quite plain. The Logos took human nature, purified it, and raised it to heaven so that it is now always present with the Father united with divinity. He implies, but does not explicitly state in the extant fragments of his commentary, that our θεοποίησις is involved in this union of humanity with God through Christ. The Son's priesthood and 1 Ibid. 127-34. 2 Migne, P.G. 82. 733B. 3 Migne, P.G. 74. 972B-D, 988C-D; Pusey, p. 468; see above p. 154 n. 1.</page><page sequence="11">160 FRANCES Μ. YOUNG intercession on our behalf are functions of his κένοισις, but they continue eternally united with his functions as God: to quote his words 'with flesh the only-begotten Logos of God rules everything, not apart from the Father'.1 He is said to be a minister, but he also sits at God's right hand; he sits as God and serves as Man, at the same time. He is the one Christ, the Logos of God who took flesh and united it with himself, so that now he unites us to the Father.2 By contrast, in the Antiochenes, the functions of Christ even in heaven are kept divided between the Logos and his Man. Chrysostom makes much of his sympathy and his eternal intercession on our behalf, but explains that these are functions of his humanity; as Man he stands interceding and ministering, but this is not worthy of his divine nature. As God he sits on the throne,3 a throne which may be a throne of judgement not a throne of grace if we postpone taking advantage of it much longer.4 His function as mediator is divided from his function as judge and king.5 This division corresponds to the unhappy tendency we have already noted to regard the Godhead as the recipient of a pro pitiatory sacrifice offered by the Manhood, and so bring about not merely a division of nature and function, but also by implication a division of will and purpose. At this point Cyril's Christology is un doubtedly more satisfactory. In the main, this examination of these commentaries has only confirmed what was already known about the two different Christo logical approaches in the pre-Chalcedon period, but it has provided further illustration of each position, its motivation, and its consequences. There follow a few comments on the two main issues raised and their relevance to modern Christological explorations. 1. 1. These two differing Christological positions clearly illustrate that the problem of Christology is most acute where it is approached with a priori ideas about the nature of God. As we have frequently noted, 1 Migne, P.G. 74. 996A; Pusey, p. 414. 2 Ibid. 969-73, 977, 984-8, 993; Pusey, pp. 413, 466-8; see above p. 154 n. 1. 3 Migne, P.G. 63. 105 ff., hi. 4 P.G. 63. 64. 5 It is interesting that both Chrysostom and Theodoret deny Christ's eternal priesthood on the ground that his sacrifice was performed once for all and is now over and done with. They accept his eternal intercession, however. Perhaps we should link this with the contrast between baptism which was performed once for all, like the death of Christ into which the convert was baptized, and repent ance for post-baptismal sin which was regarded as always possible. Chrysostom's inconsistent acceptance of Christ's eternal priesthood in other passages may be associated with the continuance of the one sacrifice of Christ in the Eucharist, which is also discussed in these Homilies. See Chrysostom, Homilies, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20, etc. and Theodoret, Migne, P.G. 82. 724A.</page><page sequence="12">IDEAS IN GREEK COMMENTARIES ON HEBREWS 161 Nicene orthodoxy as it was understood within the framework of con temporary philosophical theology made the Christological problem essentially insoluble.1 If the Logos is ομοούσιος τω Πατρί, the Incarnation becomes possible only if one of the following three possibilities is allowed: (i) if we implicitly deny the possibility of the full humanity of Christ—the path that Cyril took, although he tried to safeguard himself against it. It must be regarded as a form of Docetism to say: the Logos cannot have suffered; the flesh suffered but it was so united to the Logos that the possibility of its giving way or succumbing to temptation and sin is not a real one. It is generally agreed that this alternative is not open to us today. Docetism, however veiled, is not a solution. The reality of Christ's human nature must be our starting-point. But we must admit that, in spite of its difficulties, Cyril's Christology, together with his soteriology, is a remarkably clear and consistent contruction. (ii) The second possibility is to separate the Logos from the Man he is said to have assumed as the Antiochenes did. This leaves room for the real humanity, but hardly allows the Logos to be in any sense Incarnate. Whatever is done or suffered, the human nature is the subject, not the Logos, who remains unaffected by temptation, sin, death, and all the experiences of the Man in whom he is supposed to be incarnate. This position is full of obvious difficulties, and is clearly not a possible alternative approach. However, it is important that we should be aware that their recognition of the true humanity of Christ, his weakness, temptation, and conflict, his progress, and his real experience of the human condition led the Antiochenes into a position which is clearly unsatisfactory. It is worth giving careful consideration to the question where we are led by our similar emphasis on the real humanity of Christ. Perhaps the consequences are equally unsatisfactory though we cannot recognize them as such. To solve our difficulties, we tend to allow the third possibility, which was not open to the Greek theologians, namely (iii) to modify the idea of the divine nature with which Christ is ομοούσιος in such a way that the Incarnation becomes conceivable. We like to deny the a priori notion that the divine nature must be impassible, we allow that God can suffer, that he can progress. Like Tertullian, though with different motives, we repudiate the God of the philosophers. We are tempted into thinking that we can get our concept of God not out of heads, but by looking at Christ.2 I think we need to consider very 1 Professor Μ. F. Wiles also draws attention to the relationship between Nicaea and the Christological controversies in his paper 'The Doctrine of Christ in the Patristic Age' (Christ for us Today, ed. N. Pittenger, 1968). 22 This approach is typified by John Robinson, whose position is criticized by Ninian Smart in his essay 'Towards a Systematic Future for Theology' (Prospect for Theology, Essays in honour of Η.

YOUNG carefully how far this procedure is justifiable, and indeed how honest we are with ourselves in making this attempt. We do in fact have some sort of concept of God prior to looking at Christ, even if it is only of a being that transcends human individuals. Any form of anthropomorphism must be approached with extreme caution, even if it is in the form of Christomorphism. It is easy to assume that some sort of sophisticated anthropomorphism is justified by a belief in the Incarnation and the revelation of God through a human being, Jesus Christ, and we must admit that theological language is bound to proceed by means of human analogies; but if we think of God's knowledge and emotions solely by analogy with our own, God inevitably tends to be reduced to our level whether we like it or not. Unless we proceed with extreme caution, we shall in the end find ourselves faced with the same problems as Chryso stom, Theodoret, and Cyril, although our approach has been different: is there any sense in saying that God learns by experience or progresses ? I must confess that as far as I can see the path of modifying a priori concepts of God is the only one worth exploring if we are to stay within the territory of traditional Christology; but I am sure that we need to be more cautious in taking it than many appear to be. 2. The second point arising from this paper is that Christology should never be divorced from soteriology; for this is the reason for its very existence, and the motive that lies behind every Christological construction. This is so not only with respect to the Christologies of Antioch and Alexandria as shown above; it is also the case in the New Testament. It is frequently said that the early centuries showed no interest in formulating a doctrine of Atonement, but this is a grossly misleading statement. The formulation of both Trinitarian and Christo logical definitions was directly caused by soteriological beliefs. The reason for the development of different Christological theories was simply that each side viewed the problem with different soteriological presuppositions. I want therefore to suggest that one of the problems with the construe tion of a satisfactory Christology now is that we have not first established a soteriology. We are distracted from this central issue by the twentieth century problems of how to bridge the gap between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith, or of how to re-express traditional Christian beliefs in modern terms. But Christology clearly should not be divorced from soteriology, and our biggest problem is that it is not clear what sal vation means in the modern world. From the point of view of religion and faith, we may adopt the view that fluidity in the interpretation extreme example of this procedure is to be found in H. W. Montefiore's paper 'Jesus, the revelation of God' (Christ for us Today, see p. 161 n. 1).</page><page sequence="14">IDEAS IN GREEK COMMENTARIES ON HEBREWS 163 of Atonement is proper, that soteriology should not be defined, that salvation means different things to different men, different civilizations, different ages. But if we do, must we not admit that Christology may have to be regarded as similarly fluid, that the attempt to produce a formal definition of the Person of Christ may be a vain undertaking; the soteriology and Christology of each individual is defined by his answer to the question 'What think ye of Christ ?' However, if we take this to its limit we shall find that soteriology has no firm basis, since, as we have seen, it was the desire to establish an unshakeable foundation for salvation that led to the definition of an ontological Christology. This problem of the relationship between Christology and soteriology needs further exploration. Frances M. Young Frances Μ. Young</page></plain_text>
