<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 il) 2004 REPRESENTING UNPREDICTABILITY: AN ANALYSIS OF A CURING RITUAL AMONG THE EAST KALIMANTAN LUANGAN (1) Isabell Herrmans University of Helsinki Abstract This article recounts the progression of a particular curing ritual performed in a small Luangan Dayak community in the province of East Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo. It describes how this ritual formed itself somewhat like an experiment in which aspects of tradition and the exigencies of contemporary life were eclectically invoked. It also describes how the ritual developed into a major social event and a forum for the negotiation of a variety of concerns in addition to curing, including shamanic authority, religious identity, and gender relations. Focusing on the ritual's emergent character, the article explores how this aspect of the ritual is essential to it, serving to maintain ritual plausibility in the face of political marginalization and existential unpredictability. Everyone is aware that life is parodie and that it lacks an interpretation. (Bataille 1985: 5) Dancing with Spirits Tak Dinas is dancing, moving her hands up and down along the sarong cloth ( penyelenteng ), which hangs down like a rope from the ceiling, connecting spirits and human beings. This is a dance of gracefulness, of vivid colour, of sweet-scent. Black oily hair, white powdered skin, shining, glittering clothes in gold and silver, ankle bells jingling with the steps. These are women dancing, first just Tak Dinas, then Tak Lodot, Tak Tiku, Nen Bujok, Nen Bola, Nen Neti, joining in, one after another. Women dressed up, perfumed, made-up. Then suddenly, Nen Pare gets up, moving slowly at first, her feet gaining confidence, but in the next moment already dancing, on her stumbling, shivering legs, swinging her hands gracefully, her palms moving outwards, her body opening up like a flower. "In four days time you will be able to walk", Tak Dinas told, exhorted, Nen Pare yesterday. And here she is now, dancing, following the others, circling, swaying. There is an uncanny feeling - surprise, confusion, hope - spectators not knowing whether to cry or laugh, what to make of this, whether to believe it or not. Nen Pare has not been up walking for months, she is almost considered not alive, having been lying invisible beneath her blue cotton mosquito net for such a long time. Tak Dinas' dance is getting wilder, faster along with the beat of the drums, the frenzied clangs of the gamelan-like kelentangen speeding up. Then suddenly she stops, the music ceases. There is complete silence for a couple of minutes. "This is what we have to offer you tonight, I don't know what other people are giving you but this is what we have." Tak Dinas is holding a tray with cakes made of sticky rice; blue, red, green, and yellow cakes. She is addressing the spirits in Indonesian, the national language. She has been called to perform a belian curing ritual for Nen Pare, who has been sick for over a year now. At first Tak Dinas refused when asked to perform a belian for Nen Pare, for whom some fifteen rituals already have been arranged this year, and who just returned from a trip to seek medical help in the regional capital of Tenggarong, several hundred kilometres downstream. Then she changed her mind, partly encouraged by the news that Nen Pare was feeling a little bit better, that she was eating again. Tak Dinas practises belian sentiu, or belian dewa-dewa as she herself sometimes prefers to call her version of this curing ritual. As in other styles of belian curing practised by the Luangan Dayaks of Kalimantan(2), the sentiu shaman uses spirit familiars to negotiate with malevolent spirits, which are believed to cause illness in the patient. The central activities in the curing act consist of chanting and dancing - the style of dancing and drumming as well as the melodic conventions of the music differing with different styles of belian. What above all separates belian sentiu from the other styles of belian curing is the 50</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 fi) 2004 particular sets of spirits contacted in the ritual, the way in which these are contacted, and the language used in contacting them. In contrast to the other styles of belian, the chants of be lian sentiu are not just in the local Luangan language, but partly in Indonesian and Kutai Malay, and partly in Luangan. The same chants are sung in both Luangan and Malay/Indonesian; different sets of spirits being addressed in different languages: those of the local world and forest environment in Luangan, those of foreign and downriver worlds in Malay/Indonesian. Tak Dinas received her version of belian sentiu in a dream when she was fourteen. She became possessed and then started to practise belian - she stresses that she got her knowledge of belian through "keturunan" (possession), not by studying under other belians as one usually does. Except for her own apprentices, Tak Dinas is the only female belian in the area (she is also a renowned midwife). Her grandmother was also a belian, although an exceptional and "cra2y" belian "running around in the woods" (female belians are said to have been much more common in former times, as were female leaders, manti). Being a belian by "keturunan", Tak Dinas relies more on visual effects, "charisma", and performance than "ordinary" (mostly male) belians do (these belians are generally more concerned with correct chanting, and "the power of words", although this, of course, is a matter of degree). Her hesitance to perform a belian for Nen Pare probably had much to do with her wish to maintain her reputation as a successful belian. She did not want to take the risk of Nen Pare dying during the ritual ( belians usually do not refuse to cure someone when asked; their own illness is almost the only acceptable excuse). Nen Bujok, Nen Pare's sister, bursts into tears. These have been hard times for her. She and her husband have moved in with her sister (and her two husbands) to help take care of her, and assist with the work in the swidden field. There has been a feeling of hopelessness, especially after the unsuccessful trip to T enggarong. The doctor whom they consulted there told Nen Pare that she had a tumour, that an operation was her only option, but Nen Pare refused to be operated on: she said she did not want to die away in town, and ordered her husbands to take her home. There have been accusations, Nen Pare's husbands interpreted the doctor's words to mean that the illness was "man-made", afflicted on her on purpose by some fellow-villager. They sued a young man, generally believed to be innocent; he, in his turn, accused Nen Pare of polygamy, told her that her illness was related to her living with two men(3). The whole affair resulted in hurt feelings and resentment. The fact that one of her husbands stole and sold a blontang{ 4) from the village graveyard in order to get money for the trip to Tenggarong, did not make relations between her family and fellow-villagers better. And here now, Nen Pare is dancing, twirling and whirling even after the others have stopped - dancing against death. Tak Dinas comforts Nen Bujok, talking in a play-like voice, a voice of spirits. "Let's wash ourselves - ayo mandi", she suggests. "Yaaa..," there is laughing and shouting, joking - "let's bathe, mandi selalul" Water is brought in, people undress themselves, the music starts again. Dancing again, Tak Dinas with the help of Mancan, her apprentice and the only male shaman taking part in this ritual, pours water over the participants who are sitting in a row on the floor, wrapped in sarongs. She splashes scented water on the heads of those of us not joining in. People get possessed; Mancan jumps up and down, stamping his feet on the floor, dancing standing on a gong, dripping with water, having himself been bathed by Tak Dinas; Nen Bujok soaking wet, giggling, stammering, pronouncing unintelligible words; and Tak Dinas, talking with that spirit voice, making you wonder: is this for real, or is it some kind of play? " Assalamu' alaikum", Ma Sarakang, one of Nen Pare's husbands, walks in, speaking out of the air, probably addressing Tak Dinas, with a loud and official sounding voice, all of a sudden dressed up in a checked cotton sarong, a white well-ironed, long-sleeved shirt and wearing a kopiah (the black cap worn by Muslim men and men all over Indonesia, often as a symbol of national identity). I have to clench my teeth not to laugh, his entrance is so unexpected, and seems so out of place - Ma Sarakang mimetically embodying Muslimness. He offers Tak Dinas a lit cigarette, referring to it as the "signature" ( tanda tangari) of his sister, who lives in another village and is unable to attend the ritual. Then he sits down, and puts his hands together to pray, whispering prayers, concentrated with his eyes shut, his head bent. Some girls are giggling, a group of young men who are playing cards look amused, but most other spectators do not pay much attention to him. 51</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (1 ) 2004 The dance goes on, the dancers dancing around the ritual construction, the balei, which occupies the centre of the room. The balei is an altar-like construction made of yellow bamboo, with walls of colourful clothing, the roof of yellow cloth with a hornbill effigy on the top. It is decorated with semi-abstract figures made of plaited coconut leaves ( ringit ), bright red flowers ( hungert dusun ), young leaves of various forest plants. In front of the construction, on each side of its entrance, are two heavy Chinese jars filled with uncooked rice. In between there is a ladder with its base on a gong on the floor, leading up to a shelf on which the dancers are putting trays of rice, beeswax candles, eggs, incense, flowers, cakes, cigarettes, 5000 rupiah bills, and small rice flour images representing human beings ( sedediri ), after first having danced around the construction with the trays in their hands. Tak Dinas is singing while she and the others dance, naming the objects placed on the altar, presenting them for the spirits. As the ritual is proceeding, more and more decorations and offerings are added to the balei; on the second to the last day the coconut leaf decorations are dyed in red and yellow, and a human skull wrapped in kajeng leaves is hung under the shelf. The beauty of the balei and the abundance of its offerings are attracting mulung, spirit familiars, from their places in heaven, and from Tanjung Ruang, the ancestral village. Then, suddenly, there are spirits from Palangkaraya, the capital of Central Kalimantan, announcing their presence, "ancestor spirits" Tak Dinas calls them, "friends of the ancestor spirits from Tanjung Ruang", she explains. This multitude of spirit beings, drawn to the ritual and the balei at its centre, bring Tak Dinas the power she needs to fight whoever, whatever is hurting Nen Pare and her family. Someone puts on the radio. It is Thursday night, the night of kesenian daerah, "regional arts", broadcast from Palangkaraya, the capital of Central Kalimantan and the centre of Hindu Kaharingan. In the province of Central Kalimantan, the local Dayak religion, commonly referred to as Kaharingan, has been recognized as a state approved religion, agama. Today Kaharingan is included in the five religions officially recognized by the Indonesian state, classified as a sect of Balinese Hinduism, and officially referred to as Hindu Kaharingan. Here in East Kalimantan, however, the provincial government has not granted Kaharingan the status that it enjoys in Central Kalimantan; instead, Kaharingan is considered as just "beliefs", kepercayaan, its followers seen (by the authorities, at least) to be primitive animists, lacking in national consciousness (cf. Atkinson 1987: 174-178). Non-Christian Luangans in East Kalimantan are classified as "people not yet possessing a religion" (prang yang belum beragama ), "not yet", as Atkinson (ibid.) has pointed out, here indicating an inevitable future conversion. Palangkaraya and Hindu Kaharingan have been on people's minds ever since the ritual started. Langkong, back from a visit to Central Kalimantan, to Benangin where his daughters live, has witnessed basarah, a weekly Hindu Kaharingan service arranged for Ranying Hatalla Langit, the almighty God ( Tuhan YangMaha Esa). He describes the newly built "prayer-hall", the crowd of people attending, the decorations used, the unison hymns and the preaching, the holy book - how good all this was, to have a religion. Mancan takes a break, asks us if it is true that we have shown pictures of him performing belian sentiu while we were in Palangkaraya. I do not know where he has got the idea from, but he clearly seems to wish we had. Ma Putup, Nen Bujok's husband, a belian sentiu by "keturunan" just like Tak Dinas, asks if he can come along if we are going there again, to meet the Great Council of Hindu Kaharingan, to visit the radio station. Some people in the village listen to the broadcasts from Palangkaraya every Tuesday and Thursday, the sound of dongkoi ("traditional" love songs) permeating the darkness of the village, entering every house. "Darma, your new name shall be Darma", Tak Dinas announces, addressing Nen Pare. "What? Darma?" This is the last day of the ritual, a pig and some chickens have just been sacrificed - and now Tak Dinas is giving Nen Pare a new name, a new name to enter a new, cool life. Darma. Ma Putup writes it down with his finger in the dust on the floor. "Derma", Ma Lombang suggests, proposing a pronunciation more consonant with the local language. "No, Darma", Tak Dinas insists. Dar-ma. The name sounds unfamiliar, foreign. Most people present do not know what to associate it with, except that it is foreign. Afterwards, I ask Mancan what he thinks about the name. Tak Dinas got it from the Kayangan spirits he explains, and then he mentions the Indonesian concept of "Darma Wanita"(5). My association of the word darma with the Hindu concept is received enthusiastically: "Of course", he says, "the Kayangan knew what they were talking about". Later Tak Dinas asks me if it is true that I think the name was a good one, and she assures me that she had never heard it before, it just came to her as she spoke, appeared automatically. 52</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 ili 2004 A Politics of Spirits For Nen Pare, for her husbands Ma Buo and Ma Sarakang, her sister Nen Bujok and her brother Ma Geneng, the dancing, the chanting, the embodiment of spirits during the eight day ritual has been an uneasy balancing between hope and despair, between life and death. Lying on her mattress under her mosquito net - for that is where Nen Pare, in accordance with general Luangan practise, still spends most of her time - she does not care much about the politics involved in curing, in contacting spirits. For her it is enough that spirits are contacted, that someone knows what should be done; the music and other "denotatively implicit forms" (Briggs 1996: 208), such as intonation, speech style etc., tells her what is going on, even when she is not watching or paying attention. For Tak Dinas, on the other hand, it is crucial to give the impression that she does know what to do; she must, to put it in Anna T sing's ( 1 990: 1 22) words, "convene an audience", and this surely is a matter of "spirit politics" as much as social politics. The spirits that Tak Dinas contacts in the ritual are either mulung, her spirit familiars, or blis, various kinds of malevolent spirits, which cause Nen Pare and her family suffering. Some of these spirits, in both categories, are part of the local world, and some come from foreign, downriver or celestial worlds. The spirit guides consist of both ancestors, great shamans from the mythical village Tanjung Ruang, and Kayangan, gods (dewa) who reside in heaven, and who are vaguely associated with Islam, and the court of the Sultanate of Kutai (which was Hindu-Buddhist until sometime between 1 500 - 1 700, then Muslim, but with persisting Hindu and earlier "animisi" influences). Through these spirit guides she negotiates with local blis as well as blis coming from downriver locations. She is, according to Langkong, calling on two different religious centres here, that of Tanjung Ruang, which represents Kaharingan, the local religion, and that of Pahu, which represents Islam(6). The dualism which Langkong intends to invoke here is not really as clear as it might seem though, as Tak Dinas is working in a world where influences keep flowing in, where other centres are announcing themselves, where borders are formed in fluidity. It has been suggested that the sentiu style of belian curing first appeared when Dayaks on the Pahu river converted to Islam in the beginning of the 20th century (Weinstock 1983: 41-43). Many locals, however, claim that belian sentiu actually originated on the river Ohong, among non-Muslim Benuaq Dayaks(7). What is generally agreed on is that belian sentiu is a relatively new form of curing. Similarities between belian sentiu and curing rituals practised by Kutai Malays, including those held at the court of the former Sultan of Kutai, are apparent and recognized by the Dayaks. These rituals use the same kind of ritual paraphernalia and ritual techniques as belian sentiu : ankle bracelets with rattling bells (or calf bracelets in the case of the Malays and some Benuaq Dayaks), emphasis on the colour yellow (symbolizing magical power and royalty), summoning of the Kayangan (a category of spirits widely known in the archipelago), the use of identical decorations etc. Belian sentiu was introduced to the central parts of the Luangan region, the area where the ritual led by Tak Dinas took place, in the 1970s. In Tak Dinas' understanding, however, the fact that belian sentiu was developed quite recently does not mean that it cannot be, at the same time, a quite ancient form of curing. She claims that Kakah Make, a Benuaq Dayak living on the river Jeleu, was the founder of belian sentiu. He once dreamt about belian sentiu and in his dream went to Tanjung Ruang to study it from his mythical ancestors. Waking up and recovering from the eight day possession following the dream, he started to practise belian sentiu and teach it to his neighbours. What could be seen as something new then, was in fact there all the time, known by Luangan mythical ancestors but concealed from their descendants until Kakah Make gained access to it through his dream. Tak Dinas has taken the consequences of her persuasion that belian sentiu is a form of curing which in fact has local origins. In her version of the ritual, which she sometimes refers to as belian dewa-dewa (referring to the spirit familiars assisting her in the ritual bathing - tota - of people) she mixes elements from what she calls belian bene ("true" belian, that is, belian luangan, a curing style which is considered the original form of belian ) with the sentiu style. Whereas this is also the case with most other belian sentius in the area, Tak Dinas does so much more explicitly and self-consciously. When other belians assert that pure belian sentiu should actually be conducted exclusively in Malay, and that pigs should not be sacrificed in the ritual (as downriver spirits do not eat pork), Tak Dinas seems to consider the hybridity to be original, not 53</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 il) 2004 a consequence of deficient knowledge or adjustment to local conditions. Belian sentiu (or be lian dewa-dewa ) as practised by Tak Dinas is a form of curing which "borrows" the power of foreignness (cf. Tsing 1993: 128), just to claim that it is, in fact, originally local. In this interplay between the autochthonous and the foreign, Tak Dinas accentuates both locality and foreignness, both similarity and difference, at times with much more elaboration than most belian sentius. Tanjung Ruang is invoked in her chanting again and again, almost over-explicitly, as if only the repeated enunciation granted it an existence. The diversity of Luangan origins is simultaneously played down, the multitude of ancestral villages summoned in belian luangan reduced to Tanjung Ruang. Tanjung Ruang stands out as a background - "clearly marked ancestrality" - contrasting with the overwhelming richness of foreign influences flowing in. Tak Dinas' dance, in its gracefulness and femininity, in the smoothness and delicacy of her movements, in the splendour of her appearance - the other women mirroring her, following her steps - stresses the performativity, the artfulness, promoted in dances at cultural festivals (cf. Tsing 1993: 235), evoking the kind of entertainment fostered on national television. The plenitude and colourfulness of the cakes served during the ritual are reminiscent of cakes served in warungs in market towns and cities on the coast, giving an impression of prosperity, even over-abundance. The balei, with all its decorations - the burning incense, surrounding it with the heavy odour of gaharu(S), the offerings of rice, coconuts, and flowers - has the appearance of a temple (in some chants it is referred to as a keraton or palace) with dancers expressing their devotion, while calling on spirits from distant places, speaking foreign languages(9). But then again, hung under the balei, wrapped in leaves, there is also the ancestral skull, symbolizing ancestral tradition, or maybe just the power of ancestors, causing thunderstorms and calamity if left out. Tak Dinas is playing with distinctions, emphasizing them, bringing them into contact by juxtaposing them. It is through a "poetics of shock" (Rutherford 1996) that she creates her authority, drawing on both local and foreign powers, creating unexpected encounters between them, and claiming the mastery of both. When the spirits from Palangkaraya announce their presence in the ritual, they are simultaneously unexpected and well prepared for. Palangkaraya and what it stands for was present in the villagers' discussion and imagination from the beginning of the ritual, invoked by Langkong's visit to Benangin, Mancan's and other participants' frequent listening to the radio, and the anthropologists' stories of Hindu Kaharingan. Yet, they are unexpected; ancestors from Palangkaraya have not been heard of before, not to mention called on in belian curing. There is something unsettling involved in this, in the relationship between ancestors, in the coupling of past and present, and in the blurring of origins. Palangkaraya is, in fact, a new town. It was created in 1957 as the capital of what was meant to become a new Dayak province, Central Kalimantan (Miles 1 967 : 1 1 4- 1 1 7). How the spirits from Palangkaraya have come to be ancestors of the Luangan, friends of the "real" ancestors from Tanjung Ruang, is something of a mystery then, although a mystery more thrilling than confusing, it seems. Their emergence, at least to some extent, appears to have been brought forth by their pertinence, and their pertinence can perhaps also explain why their unexpected appearance succeeds so well in attracting the attention of the participants, drawing them into participation, more and more people taking part in the dancing as the ritual proceeds, people arriving from neighbouring villages. The emergence of these spirits is exactly what constitutes Tak Dinas' ritual authority: they are the very stuff of what make up her ability to create relevancy, to convene an audience. By joining the ritual, the spirits from Palangkaraya situate belian sentiu within the same framework as Hindu Kaharingan, in an analogous relation to the national politics of religion. Whereas Hindu Kaharingan is not practised outside Central Kalimantan, belian sentiu is almost exclusively practised in East Kalimantan (with the exception of some rare instances in a few border villages in Central Kalimantan). The recognition of Hindu Kaharingan as a state-approved religion, agama, was the result of a long history of resistance (mainly carried out by Ngaju Dayaks) against suppression of Dayak identity and religion by Muslims and state officials (see Miles 1976: 102-124). The recognition of Hindu Kaharingan has contributed to allowing the Dayaks to maintain their Dayak identity, at the same time as it also has involved an extensive process of religious rationalization, adapting Hindu Kaharingan to the criteria defining world religions in the national ideology(lO). Whereas the details of the process of recognition as well as the exact contents of the newly 54</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 fi) 2004 rationalized religion are largely unknown to East Kalimantan Luangans, the idea of belonging to a distinct Dayak religion is highly appealing to most of them(l 1). At least for the moment, however, there seems to be no real prospect of an inclusion of Kaharingan in East Kalimantan into Hindu Kaharingan. While the Central Kalimantan government, which partly consists of Dayaks, generally has been sympathetic to Dayak interests, the Muslim dominated East Kalimantan government has so far been unwilling to consider the question. Seen against this background, it is not surprising that belian sentiu has taken on a special significance for some Luangans living in East Kalimantan. Tak Dinas1 introduction of the spirits from Palangkaraya, together with the persistent talk about Hindu Kaharingan during the ritual, points to this significance. In certain respects, belian sentiu can be said to represent a local alternative to Hindu Kaharingan, or maybe more to the point, the attraction of both lies in how they represent ways to maintain and modernize local tradition in the face of national integration. In the relatively short time that it has been practised, belian sentiu - and related curing forms such as Tak Dinas' dewa-dewa - has rapidly gained great popularity. In many villages (downstream from the village where Tak Dinas' ritual was held) few of the younger belians are learning the older forms of curing, most just study belian sentiu (Massing 1982: 73). Part of the explanation for this undoubtedly lies in the fact that belian sentiu is easier to learn than the older belian forms (which use many more words, and so demand much more time and practise). Another, and perhaps more interesting reason for this, is the use of foreign language in belian sentiu, and what could be called a "downriver aesthetics", with stress on artistic performance and refined ( halus ) conduct, which many younger people find attractive(12). That belian sentiu was recognized as akin to Hindu Kaharingan in discussions among the ritual participants, as well as through the presence of the Hindu Kaharingan spirits visiting the sentiu ritual, is no wonder then. Belian sentiu and Hindu Kaharingan are alike in that they both reformulate local tradition. In addition, they are, of course, also similar in that they use foreignness to achieve this; foreign elements are not only borrowed but encapsulated in the local world, and thus made part of it. They are, to make an analogy with the Biak of Irian Jaya, "resisting what is strange by making it [their] own" (Rutherford 1996: 600). In order to resist the power of others - so as to counter the accusations of primitiveness connected with lack of religion, among other things - both similarities and differences have to be stressed. By making oneself similar to the other, one gains the power to be unlike. The issue here, clearly, is "not so much staying the same, but maintaining sameness through alterity" (Taussig 1993: 129). Tak Dinas, as well as many of the other ritual participants, are engaging in a project in which belian sentiu is about much more than curing; for them, belian sentiu forms part of an attempt to sustain a distinct, local tradition. Truth as Experiment Ma Sarakang, suddenly walking in during the ritual, looking as if he was performing a parody of Muslimness, unsettles any simple understanding about what it might mean to speak from the margins(l 3). As Anna Tsing (1994: 279) has conceptualized it, margins are the "zones of unpredictability at the edges of discursive stability, where contradictory discourses overlap, or where discrepant kinds of meaning-making converge". Influenced by this conception, my intention here is to show how some particular people participating in a particular ritual, who occupy a space in many ways marginal, engage in a project not so much intended as overt, or covert, resistance, but formed as an experiment in which the complexity of the surrounding world is invoked, and its power relations played with. This is an experiment rooted in sensuousness, infused by the unpredictability of life. As such, this experiment is not primarily political for the participants, and marginality, although not irrelevant, is not all that is at issue for them. This paper attempts to move beyond what to me seems the somewhat narrowly political ground explored by Tsing (1993) in her in many ways insightful study of Meratus Dayak marginality. It aims to add an existential dimension to the query at hand and to some degree de-emphasize the political rationality of the subjects of marginality. The foreignness introduced by Ma Sarakang is not in any easy way part of the engagement of foreignness otherwise sought for in the ritual. Ma Sarakang is not integrating his Muslimness with the sentiu style (he could do that, as he is a fully learned belian sentiu himself), but keeps its foreignness intact, so to speak, 55</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 fi) 2004 turning it into prayer instead of dancing, for example. This does not mean that his intentions are to overthrow or lessen Tak Dinas' authority; instead, he is bringing in a power of his own, although in a somewhat "obtuse" (Barthes 1977) way, through a behaviour which in another context would seem ordinary, but which here appears misplaced, strange( 1 4). He is acting in accordance with personal experience, having travelled widely in East Kalimantan, but not to Central Kalimantan as some other participants (e.g. Langkong), bringing in his knowledge of Muslim behaviour as still another possibility (we should not forget that Nen Pare is his wife, her well-being being of much more concern for him than for most other attendants, some of whom have not forgotten accusations in the recent past). His behaviour reminds us of how uncontrollable life is, how ambiguous every attempt at coming to terms with its indeterminacy ultimately must be. Interacting with spirits (and many times with people, for that part) one is confronted with what Mary Steedly has described as a "question of plausibility" (as opposed to certainty), that is, a question of "how one goes about making sense of something you can never get to the bottom of' (1993: 35). As Steedly (ibid.) argues for Karo spirit mediums, attitudes toward spirits are not characterized by "belief in the existential sense" (faith is really not very relevant here). Spirits, among both the Karo and the Luangan, are not blindly believed in, but rather actively made sense of, frequently distrusted, and casually rather than devoutly accepted, because ultimately they are not known, and no one even pretends to know them completely. By stressing the bottomlessness and the uncertainty involved in spirit interaction, I here want to draw attention to how sense-making is formed in an emergent present, viable "in between the segments of ritual" (Taussig 1987: 442), but not necessarily applicable or even thought to be so outside. In doing so, I want to raise a criticism against the somewhat instrumental or goal-oriented approach to ritual represented by, for example, Marina Roseman who in an analysis of a healing ritual (1996) among the Temiar of Malaysia - a ritual in many ways similar to that conducted by Tak Dinas - describes what she calls a "cosmology gone wild": a spirit medium treating illnesses with both "forest" and "foreign" etiologies, calling on spirits from both upstream and downstream, themselves forming spatial categories with boundaries and implications not as clear as they used to be. Roseman concludes her in many ways fine analysis by stating that: Temiars invent a poetics from the clash of competing societies. Through such creations, cultures carve their musics of survival, and gain the strength to carry on. Refreshed by the cool liquid of the spirits, "lightened" [- ] as if a load were removed - "empowered", to use a cosmopolitan metaphor - Temiars return to the realm of daily life. (Roseman 1996: 264) What is problematic here, at least if Roseman's conclusion is taken to apply to the Luangan situation, is the emphasis on the return to a realm of daily life, and in particular, the suggested (but undemonstrated) transmittal to it of a catharsis-like state attained in the ritual amounting to "social healing". In Roseman's rather lineal interpretation, the significance of what takes place in the ritual appears to articulate, a little too well, with the social world preceding and following it. Missing in this kind of interpretation is the unpredictability characterizing real events as they unfold in time (cf. Bourdieu 1977: 4-9), as well as the vagueness and ambiguity characterizing the relationship between ritual and non-ritual realms. As it seems to me, Roseman does not sufficiently pay attention to the way rituals are formed in "a continually changing present situation" (Steedly 1993: 1 1), being representations "never complete in [themselves], but [-] openly and continuously compared with the life represented" (Mitchell 1973: xiii, quoted in Taussig 1987: 445). This "inescapable incompleteness of representations", we may note, is a problem which bears upon the above-mentioned one of ritual plausibility, which in the particular Luangan case presented here, is a question about how a technique aimed at curing, admittedly uncertain in its outcome, is made to seem highly appropriate, even when the curing fails. In this case, as no doubt in many others too, this question largely pertains to the open-ended relationship between spirits and human beings, which is created and re-created in between the segments of the ritual. The participants in the ritual led by Tak Dinas did not return to daily life refreshed or empowered, at least not all of them, and none of them unambiguously, although the ritual certainly contained its moments of refreshment and empowerment 1 5). As for Nen Pare, she did feel a little bit better for a couple of weeks after the ritual, but then got worse again, refusing to eat, and within two months literally starved to death. She never became Darma, at least not for most of the villagers, who continued to call her by either her personal 56</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 f 1 ) 2004 name or by the teknonym Nen Pare( 1 6). Nen Bujok continued to care for her sister, feeling hopeful at times, but most of the time rather depressed. Many of the participants were in fact sceptical about the possibility of curing Nen Pare through a ritual in the first place. Kakah Ramat, an old belian specialized in the luangan and bawo styles of curing, and considered one of the most knowledgeable curers in the region, made it very clear that he considered Nen Pare as not really standing a chance if she did not have the operation (Kakah Ramat himself had already led several belian rituals for Nen Pare, and in fact even did so once more - although no less sceptical than before - the day before she died, when asked to by her family). Ma Geneng, Nen Pare's brother and one of the organizers of the ritual, remarked that Nen Pare was already rotten inside, and that it therefore was most unlikely that she would recover. Tak Dinas herself was hesitant to take up the case, persuaded to do so as much by kin obligations and expectations among her apprentices, as by assurances that Nen Pare was feeling better (Tak Dinas, resident in a downstream village some distance away, was first called to attend another ritual, then asked to perform the belian for Nen Pare by her family, who took the opportunity to do so when she was in the neighbourhood). The authority of Tak Dinas did not derive from her ability to control an uncontrollable world, but from her power to make sense of it in its arbitrariness. The ritual discussed in this paper can be said to have formed itself like a montage; things happened, not always as planned, sentiments and moods shifted, spirits arrived, people entered the house, talked, danced, became possessed, slept. There were interruptions: dogs trying to get in that were thrown out (Tak Dinas did not allow dogs to enter the house during the ritual), discussions so interesting that dancers had to pause, delays relating to the preparation of ritual paraphernalia and food, prolonging the ritual. Like Walter Benjamin's preoccupation with montage, and like the yagé nights in South America, the ritual technique used by Tak Dinas can be said to be: ...not bound to an image of truth as something deep and general hidden under layers of superficial and perhaps illusory particulars. Rather, what is at work here is an image of truth as experiment, laden with particularity, now in this guise, now as that one... (Taussig 1987: 445) Tak Dinas' sense-making takes the form of exploration, allowing the complexity of the Luangan world to enter the ritual, the negotiation between people and spirits. What she does is open up a space of possibilities, one in which recovering is made possible. For ritual participants, this space can accommodate quite different projects; in the ritual discussed here, the use of belian sentiu to create a "different" place (de Certeau 1986: 229; cf. Spyer 1996: 43) within the Indonesian nation-state, came to be a leading one. Another issue, which formed itself as a prospect in the ritual, was the empowerment of women. A woman herself, Tak Dinas attracted other women to participate, encouraging them to stand up, to dance, to become belians. As the ritual proceeded there were more and more women actively taking part, some of them just following Tak Dinas dancing, others performing as fellow belians or her apprentices, "answering her" ( nuing ), repeating her words and gestures. For these women, Tak Dinas' somewhat feminine aesthetics, her way to accentuate them through movement, attire, and appearance, formulated a different way to gain ritual power, one in which performance is emphasized as much as formalization through words(17). This does not mean, however, that her aesthetics were not attractive to men as well; Mancan, her male apprentice in the ritual is one example; he was very exited about performing with her, and when he performed a similar ritual in her absence a few months later, he was dressed as a woman for part of the time. Although Luangan women are in no way excluded from the opportunity of studying to become belians , very few choose to do so, partly because they would find it rather uncomfortable to study with male belians. Some have, however, seen their chance in Tak Dinas, who in her turn willingly takes on apprentices, the sheer number of them adding to her ritual authority. For these women Tak Dinas' curing thus formed a female project, one in which Tak Dinas encouraged them into participation, a participation at the centre of things, not on its periphery(18). Nen Pare's dance - so unlikely and so unforeseeable, yet such an evocative image of what ritual plausibility in this ritual was about - shows us how the negotiation between spirits and people, in its sensuousness and mimetical excess, is practically experienced as formulating a possibility, an opening. Nen Pare did not dance because she was recovering, but because she was made to believe that she might do so (she was probably also dancing for the same reason as the other women, driven by a sense of "women power" and female togetherness). Contacting spirits and negotiating with them, Tak Dinas cannot be sure of the 57</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 ( 1 ) 2004 outcome, but what she can do is try to persuade both spirits and people what it could be. Tak Dinas is not denying the unpredictability of life in doing this, but with the help of her spirit familiars, in their "hybrid authenticity" (Clifford 1997: 187), she conjures open-endedness, and is thus showing life to be changeable, illnesses curable. The role of ancestor spirits in this process points to the importance of tradition, of making a connection between a future, ultimately unknown, and a past, already confronted and lived. It is against the background of these ancestor spirits that the present is rendered meaningful, that is, contextually and momentarily meaningful. Negotiating with spirits, Tak Dinas refers to both the continuity of tradition, and the unpredictability of life, and it is, as it seems to me, from the tension between them that she evokes what I have referred to as a possibility. Endnotes 1 .Acknowledgements. The research on which this paper is based was conducted during eighteen months in 1993 and 1996-1997, mainly in the District of Bentian Besar in the Regency of Kutai, Province of East Kalimantan, but also in adjacent districts in the Regency of Barito Utara in the Province of Central Kalimantan. The research was sponsored by LIPI (Lembaga limu Pengetahuan Indonesia) and Prof. Parsudi Suparlan at Universitas Indonesia, and funded by The Cultural Academy of Finland and The Nordic Institute of Asian Studies. The research was carried out together with Kenneth Sillander. 2. The term "Dayak" generally refers to non-Muslim Borneans (excluding the Chinese), whereas "Malay" signifies the Muslim populations of the island. The Luangan are a Dayak group which consists of a large number of loosely connected subgroups, constituting a vaguely bounded linguistic, cultural and religious entity (see Hudson 1967; Mallinckrodt 1928; Weinstock 1983). The Luangan occupy a large territory between the Barito and Mahakam rivers in the southeast of Borneo, in the Indonesian provinces of East and Central Kalimantan. The ritual described in this paper took place in the East Kalimantan district of Bentian Besar, in the central parts of the Luangan area, close to the provincial border. This is a somewhat remote upriver region located adjacent to what is regarded as the Luangan's ancestral homeland. 3. Polyandry has traditionally been practised among the Luangan (although quite infrequently), but is today prohibited by the government and thus practised only unofficially and with some ambivalence. 4. A blontang is a carved hardwood pole (often anthropomorphic) used in secondary mortuary rituals (and some other larger Luangan rituals) for tying the water buffalo to be sacrificed. 5. Darma wanita is an association for the wives of civil servants, founded by the late Mrs. Suharto. 6. Pahu is the name of the nearest river area inhabited by a majority of Muslims. Like most Malays living close to or among Luangans, these Muslims were originally Dayaks. Nevertheless, in the village where the ritual described in this paper took place, present-day inhabitants use the word Pahu not only for the inhabitants of this river area but as a generic designation for all Malays; even the national language (which is a standardized form of Malay) may sometimes be referred to as bahasa Pahu. 7. Regarding the question of the origin of be lian sentiu , one has to consider that there are also some other forms of Malay curing such as be lian kenyong and be lian dew a- dew a (to be distinguished from Tak Dinas' be lian dewa-dewa ), which are used by some Luangans, and which are sometimes regarded as separate forms of curing, sometimes classified as variants of belian sentiu. Tak Dinas used to practise belian kenyong , in which she employed Muslim blis as mulungs, a dangerous enterprise which she abandoned on the request of her daughter, fearing for her mother's life. Belian kenyong is regarded as an older form of curing than belian sentiu , and Tak Dinas claims that it was introduced to her home village when she was eight years old. It is not practised in the village in which the curing ritual for Nen Pare took place. 8. Gaharu is an incense resin (Aquilana sp.) collected for export to the Middle East and other places (see Momberg et al. 2000: 27 1 ). Whereas bemueng incense wood (Agathis sp.) is favoured over gaharu in other styles of belian , only gaharu can be used in belian sentiu. Similarly, food offerings for "foreign" spirits and spirit familiars in belian sentiu must be made using coconut oil substituting for pork fat. 9. Massing (1982: 73-74) implies that the balei is also seen as a mosque by some Benuaq Dayaks. Whereas Luangans make ritual constructions similar to the balei during all larger belian rituals (but outside the house as distinct from this case), this one (which is called balei mensigit lima) is nevertheless made to appear special - more like a place of worship - by being unusually richly decorated and used throughout the ritual, as well as on account of the dance in front of it: each dancer performing a solo dance standing on a gong, while holding an offering. After Tak Dinas' ritual for Nen Pare had ended, members of the household which organized it, lighted a candle at the balei each night for a week, standing silently in front of it for a moment. 10. In order to bring Hindu Kaharingan closer to the world religions, a Hindu Kaharingan council (Majelis Besar Agama Hindu Kaharingan) has been established. Apart from having formalized and standardized rituals, the council has compiled a holy book ( Panaturan ), and constructed prayer halls for the all-powerful creator, Ranying Hatalla Langit, who, as an answer to the demand for monotheism in the national ideology, has achieved an increasingly prominent role. Today the council has branches on both district (kabupaten) and subdistrict ( kecamatan ) levels in Central Kalimantan, and its authorization is needed for the arrangement of major rituals. Its influence is perhaps most clearly manifested in the weekly services ( basarah ), during which, in addition to worship, administrative meetings of the council's village representatives are held. (Schiller 1997: 109-131) Similar processes of religious 58</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 ( 1 ) 2004 rationalization have occurred in many parts of Indonesia, for examples from Bali and highland Java, see Geertz (1973) and Hefner (1985). 1 1 . 1 am talking about Kaharingan Luangans here, not those Luangans who have converted to Christianity. Christianity, in the form of both Protestantism and Catholicism, was introduced to the central parts of the Luangan region in the 1930's. Today more than half of the Luangan population consider themselves Christians, whereas the others regard themselves either as Hindu Kaharingans or as "still lacking a religion" ( belum beragama). Some Luangans who belum beragama also consider themselves Kaharingans, as opposed to Hindu Kaharingans; the people in the village where the ritual lead by Tak Dinas took place all belong to this category. 12. Attraction to belian sentiu was especially evident in the case of Mancan, Tak Dinas' enthusiastic male apprentice and her co -belian in the ritual for Nen Pare. He, it is interesting to note, had an exceptional interest in development and modernization in comparison with other villagers. 13. Marginality and the agency of marginal peoples has been a favourite subject in Indonesian studies lately (see Tsing 1993, 1994; Spyer 1996; Rutherford 1996, 2000; Keane 1997; and Li 1999). 14. His behaviour would seem ordinary in Malay society, or in mixed Dayak-Malay villages, and some urban situations. Here, however, at a Kaharingan ritual in a village where all inhabitants are Kaharingans, it turned out a little odd, despite Ma Sarakang's interest in selective aspects of Islam, and his official status as a Muslim (he has chosen to categorize himself as Muslim on his identity card). 15. After eight days and eight nights, involving not just participation through dancing and intense socializing, but also the work of bringing materials from the forest for the ritual paraphernalia and then manufacturing it, as well as drying, husking, and cooking rice for more and more attendants, most of the participants were in fact quite relieved when it was all over, feeling primarily tired, rather than refreshed. 16. Luangans have both "personal" names, and names that can be regarded as teknonyms, that is, names that they get when they have children or grandchildren, or when they reach the age when they normally would do so. Female teknonyms take the form of Nen X or Tak X (i.e. mother of X, or grandmother of X) while male teknonyms, according to the same logic, read as Ma X or Kakah X. Central Luangan practice is perhaps unusual in that most people get their teknonyms not from children or grandchildren but from other "things", such as habits or particular events associated with the person in question, or as the result of a wordplay connecting the teknonym with the personal name. Nen Pare, for example, means "mother of rice"; Darma was a substitute for her personal name. Personal names are normally used for persons on a lower generational level than the speaker, and sometimes also for people on the same generational level, and of the same approximate age as oneself; for older people, one is not allowed to pronounce personal names but must use teknonyms. Some people do for some reason never get teknonyms which "stick to them". Both real names and teknonyms may be changed overtime, personal names often after severe illness, teknonyms with changed status. A new personal name usually replaces the former one, whereas several teknonyms commonly are used at one and the same time. 17. Tak Dinas' way to stress performative elements in the ritual is not just a way for her to establish female shamanship (cf. Tsing 1993 on the creation of female shamanship among the Meratus Dayaks), but as much a result of her being a belian by "keturunan". Ma Putup, a male shaman who is also a belian by "keturunan", stresses performance as much as she does, although in a very different way. Being a belian by "keturunan" means that ritual authority is less attached to an office (cf. Bloch 1974) than it is for "ordinary" belians, and more dependent on "personal" innovations (which are normally received as gifts from the spirits). 18. Today, women participate in belian rituals as assistants ( penyempatung ), who help the shaman to prepare offerings, and answer him (typically quietly, with backs turned to the audience) when he speaks with "spirit voices". Women also participate in rituals by playing the musical instruments (as do men, too) and by cooking the food for spirits and participants. Women very seldom perform as belians ; when they do, it is most often as belian sentius. There is also one belian style called belian bawe ("woman belian "), which in the past used to be practised mostly by female belians , but which today is practised mostly by men. Exactly why women nowadays seldom become belians is unclear, but probably in some way it is related to "outside" influence. References Atkinson, J.
