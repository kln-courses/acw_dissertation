<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL MAGDALINO, L'orthodoxie des astrologues: La science entre le dogme et la divination a Byzance (VIIe-XIVe siecle). (Realites Byzantines, 12.) Paris: Lethielleux, 2006. Paper. Pp. 195. ?27. Astrology in Byzantium has earned the attention of various scholars, but none has at tempted a synthetic treatment of astrology's role in Byzantine culture. The genius of Paul Magdalino's L'orthodoxie des astrologues lies in such a synthesis and in the book's central thesis. Magdalino argues that astrologers in Byzantium shared with many late-antique thinkers a commitment to "the contemplation of the universe as a manifestation of the creative activity of the divinity" (pp. 11-12). In this late-antique "cosmological culture," represented by the Pseudo-Dionysios, Maximos the Confessor, George of Pisidia, and the astrologer Stephen of Alexandria, "astrology finds its raison d'etre as a complement of</page><page sequence="2">214 Reviews theology" (p. 54). This rationale for the study of astrology bore abundant fruit in the lands that eventually become Islamic; it bore little fruit in Byzantium. Why not? Because icono phile theologians made "the end of all creation ... the deification of man" and, that "de ification assured, all that is exterior to the holy man, icon of God, merits no attention, and the idea that the image of the divine is to be sought in the universe as a whole becomes superfluous" (p. 54). Magdalino lays this argument out with his usual erudition. In the first two chapters he makes the case for the continuation of late-antique astrology and cosmology into the early centuries of Byzantium. By detailing the astrological activity and cosmological assumptions of various seventh-century writers, Magdalino shows that the triumph of the "anthropo morphic" theology of the iconophiles and the defeat of the "cosmological" theology of the astrologers "was not foreseeable in the development of proto-Byzantine culture" (p. 12). In the third chapter he establishes that astrologers were formative figures in the cultural revival that began in eighth-century Byzantium and proposes that the events and person alities of the iconoclast controversy reveal "a fundamental line between scientific thought and iconoclast thought.... Just as the anthropomorphic tendency became the domain of the iconodules, the cosmology of Christianized Neoplatonism reinforced the adversaries of images" (p. 67). A subplot runs throughout this chapter as well: that the opponents of images were more likely to be mathematicians, astrologers, and "scientists" (e.g., Leo the Mathematician) while the iconophiles were humanists (e.g., Photios). Moreover, the com petition between the two groups lasted beyond the end of iconoclasm, an insight that may lead to reassessment of many later conflicts and controversies. After the triumph of Orthodoxy in 843, the iconophiles/humanists were in control. The practice of astrology continued, but always below the surface and subservient to a church that privileged anthropomorphic contemplation of the divine. The eleventh century saw developments in astrology, but its status remained low, in part because of its exoticism. It was a lay occupation, and a foreign one. Only in the twelfth century did some writers try again to defend astrology theoretically and even theologically. A text attributed to Manuel I Komenos (1143-80) tries "to render astrology orthodox, once and for all" (p. 128) by making a strict division between astrology and magic (pp. 120-21). But this attempt failed dramatically. Opposition came from the monk Michael Glykas, from the canonist Theodore Balsamon, from the historian Niketas Choniates-the list could be much longer. It seems that the use of astrology "can be tol erated on condition that it never pretends to have been Christianized" (p. 130). Discredited by the fall of the empire to the Latins in 1204, astrology went underground in the thirteenth century. Remarkably, it reemerged in the fourteenth at the imperial court. In this Palaiologan revival of the defense of astrology Magdalino sees a reaction against two developments: the dominance of Aristotelian natural philosophy and the claims of early hesychast monks to experience God bodily. One representative of this movement even asserted that contemplation of the heavenly bodies is a surer way to contemplation of the divine than asceticism. Like their forerunners the iconoclasts, and like the other opponents of the hesychasts, these defenders of astrology lost. While the practice of astrology contin ued, and while the fourteenth century was even "something of a golden age in Byzantine astrology" (p. 160), the astrologers' claims to orthodoxy were decisively rejected. Still, by fomenting a contest between learned scholars and ascetics, defenders of astrology were crucial for yet another stage in the development of Byzantine religion: "Inasmuch as the challenge existed at the very origin of the hesychast controversy, one could even argue that it was the orthodoxy of the astrologers that forced the orthodoxy of the monks to define itself" (p. 162). No reader will agree with all of Magdalino's arguments, nor are they always easy to follow. He sometimes overestimates the erudition of his readers, and a chronological table</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 215 of the important works discussed would have been useful. But those are minor points about a masterly piece of work. Magdalino's previous work has changed our conception of the ways in which Byzantine culture changed, turned back upon itself, and changed again. This book continues to shed new light-on iconoclasm, on Oriental influences in Byzantine culture, on hesychasm, and more. It should be read by all students of Byzantine culture. Scholars of the Italian Renaissance may be interested, as well, in a battle between humanists and "scientists" that has parallels in their epoch; students of Eriugena may find Magdalino's passing reference to the great Dionysian Carolingian interesting, if frustratingly brief (p. 81). With all that still needs to be done in terms of the dating and analysis of astrological texts, this book cannot and will not have the last word. It will, however, remain the first word for some time to come. TIA KOLBABA, Rutgers University</page></plain_text>
