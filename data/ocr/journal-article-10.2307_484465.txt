Zaire is a wellspring of creativity in the contemporary arts from music to sculpture and painting. Its art forms have influenced popular culture throughout Africa and the Americas, although the artists often remain unknown outside of their local setting. The present catalogue, developed around a 1985 Canadian exposition of fifty original popular paintings from Zaire assembled by Jean-Pierre Jacquemin of Brussels, is a refreshing and significant collaborative work. It contains a foreword by Roland Sanfagon, Director of the Department of History at the Universit6 Laval, a perceptive overview of popular painting in Zaire by Jean-Pierre Jacquemin, and three scholarly commentaries by Jean Simard, David Karel, and Bogumil Jewsiewicki. This interdisci- plinary combination of anthropology, art history, and social history results in a lively dialogue and informative background for understanding the paintings. The work of Ulli Beier on Nigerian art during the 195os placed contemporary Afri- can art on the map as a topic of scholarly interest and a potential domain of explora- tion for collectors. In 1976 Ilona Szombati-Fabian and Johannes Fabian's landmark article on popular Zairian painting in Shaba Province opened the possibility for seri- ous scholarly discussion of this recent art form. The present collection goes beyond previous commentaries on popular Zairian painting in its inclusion of artists from the cities of Kinshasa and Kisangani as well as Lubumbashi. The exposition on which this catalogue is based, along with that of Badi Banga Ne-Mwine presented in 1982 at the Mus6e des Arts D6coratifs in Paris, represents one of the few collections of popular Zairian paintings publicly available outside Africa. Innovative designs and styles such as self-portraiture and clever anthropomorphic "animal" paintings pique the interest of connoisseurs already familiar with some of the more standard genres and subgenres of popular Zairian painting such as idyllic landscapes, mami wata, and colonie belge. Jacquemin, Simard and Karel provide insightful commentaries on the stylistic subtleties of the paintings and touch upon the biographies of the artists. These commentaries, however, give us little sense of the aesthetic development and local artistic criticism of the paintings. This "eth- noaesthetic" dimension is absent in part because the painters are not discussed in detail with reference to their regional styles, ateliers, and local audiences, although Karel and Jewsiewicki mention this background. The link between tourist art, used by many of the painters to gain their livelihood, and popular art is given scant atten- tion. The authors tell us that popular paintings are purchased primarily by middle-class (petite bourgeoisie) and working-class Zairians for display in their homes and places of business. In his discussion of the artist Tshibumba's painting commemorating the execution of a domestic servant in colonial Elizabethville, Jewsiewicki gives us an important clue about the meanings of popular paintings for the local audience. The basic issue is not the stylistic naivete of the paintings but rather their social and polit- ical significance. Jewsiewicki presents archival and oral historical documentation on the hanging of Frangois, a domestic servant who murdered his master in revenge for adultery. The hanging, which took place in the courtyard of a local Catholic church in 1921, is portrayed by the artist as a flagrant injustice ("la vraie justice non appliqu6e").</page><page sequence="2">465 Book Reviews / Comptes rendus Jewsiewicki astutely notes that part of Tshibumba's inscription reads "the hanging of Francois in Lubumbashi" even though the city did not acquire that name until 1972, nearly a decade after Zairian independence. He carefully unearths a semantic process whereby the tacit parallel is drawn between past and present; the past is actually a metaphor for the present. By means of this semantic isotopy, the artist expresses social and political commentaries on perceived injustices in the present. The local appeal of colonie belge and related subgenres of Zairian painting lies precisely in this type of veiled criticism. Indirect social criticism of the problems of neocolonialism is also apparent in mami wata paintings, believed to have been influenced by popular Hindu posters imported to Africa during the 1940s. These paintings present women of ostensibly Mediterranean or Indian origin in mermaid form, adorned with watches and expensive Western jewelry. The watches are usually set to the "bewitching hour" (2:oo a.m. or 3:oo a.m.), although such details are invisible in the reproductions. The authors' discussions of mami wata might have been enhanced by the inclusion of recent research on the topic. Karel interprets the mami wata as a temptation in the image of the biblical Eve rather than as a talisman with magical potency. An exclusive contract with her is believed to bring wealth, success, and the competence to deal with modern life, but at a price. The mami wata image is powerful, imbued with its own life-force, and meant not only to be admired but also to be "used." Hence, one can account for the ubiquity of mami wata images in local business establishments and the offices of urban folkhealers throughout Central and Southern Africa. The goal of making popular Zairian painting available to a broad audience of appre- ciators and collectors outside of Africa is certainly appropriate for an exposition cata- logue. The static display of artworks, however, often transforms them into something quite different than they are in their original context or in local expositions organized by the artists. Anthropologists and historians intervene as the new "middlemen" and "art brokers" by providing an archaeology of cultural knowledge through their repre- sentations of the artists and their interpretations of the artworks. This interpretive process is a weighty responsibility, for it affects both artistic careers and the direction of scholarship. When the authors introduce anthropological and historical discussions with the trappings of internal notes and bibliographic references, they invoke the literary genre of scholarly, rather than popular criticism. Moreover, an art catalogue for general readers should provide reproductions of high quality that preserve the aesthetic dimensions of the artworks. While the authors of this catalogue are to be commended for bringing popular Zairian art to public attention, they have also produced what Clifford Geertz (1983) terms a "blurred genre," whose appeal is precariously balanced between art criticism and social science.
