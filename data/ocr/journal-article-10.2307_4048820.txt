<plain_text><page sequence="1">Helen Clover and Margaret Gibson, editors. The Letters of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury. New York: Oxford University Press. 1980. Pp. 204. $42.50. This edition of Lanfranc's letters is a superb exemplar for anyone editing a medieval text from a multiplicity of manuscripts. Fifty-four letters by the archbishop of Can- terbury, 1070-89, five by others, and two memoranda appear in the original Latin with an English translation on facing pages (a marvel of typesetting). Helen Clover of Cambridge University established the Latin text in 1961, and then after her death, Margaret Gibson, Senior Lecturer in Medieval History at the University of Liver- pool, took over. She provides an introduction, translation, and notes-and a lot more: three Concordances; three Appendixes; a General Index and four others of Recipients, Incipits, Manuscripts, and Quotations, Biblical, classical, and medieval. Few products of current scholarly craftsmanship show such perfective skill. The Latin text is based on two manuscripts, one from the British Library written c. 1100, and the other from the twelfth century in the Vatican Library. Gibson describes in detail a dozen other manuscripts, five later transcripts, and the early printed editions. Hers, however, is the first to present the letters in the sequence used in the BL MSS. which has "the literary form" of a "letter-collection" (p. 13), one made by 1100, perhaps before 1089. What gives unity to the collection is Lanfranc's personality. The letters show this man with supreme authority over England's clergy helping Wiliam the Conqueror to establish a Norman ascendancy over English society. But what was Lanfranc really like? The schoarly answer is in Gibson's biography, Lanfranc of Bec (1978), but the let- ters, too, are quite suggestive. Loyal to his king, respectful towards his popes, and devoted to his God, Lanfranc showed genuine feeling and affection for his fellow clerics. Yet he did not give an inch when York's archbishop challenged the primacy of Canterbury's jurisdiction over all England. Generosity and spirituality appear in his prayers to the Lord Almighty in behalf of friends suffering physically or spiritual- ly. Lanfranc tried to bring his colleagues closer to God Whom he endowed with attri- butes more than anthropomorphic, such as divine majesty that would at his interces-</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 179 sion bless and free them from all sins. His messages, his orders and commands, his entreaties, and even his reprimands serve to vivify England's laws and institutions. Lanfranc fought consistently to establish clerical celibacy, and his penalties for cleri- cal marriage, for adultery or divorce were severe. Once, when the abbess and prioress of Barking were at outs with one another, he ordered "the abbess to be an abbess and the prioress a prioress" and to "behave as befits her station" (p. 175). Scholars concerned with the ecclesiastical life of Norman England and its conti- nental connections will find this reliable edition of Lanfranc's letters a boon. Teachers may brighten up their lectures with quotations in Gibson's felicitous prose. Pedants may quibble over a few poetic licenses, but these faithfully reflect the intent of Lanfranc's messages, and they do not betray his meaning. Students, too, may en- joy discovering how intimate and personal an archbishop's activities once were. The mood and zest that Lanfranc put into his letters require that Gibson, who gave style to their English version, should share with the archbishop the praise due for their book's charm.
