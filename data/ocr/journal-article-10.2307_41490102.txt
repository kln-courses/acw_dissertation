Throughout villages and cities in Bengal, Orissa, Assam and the Kathmandu Valley the occasion is marked by pomp and circumstance. In Bengal especially, this worship is a reflection of a culture that has given goddesses a privileged position over male deities from at least the time of the Pãlas.2 However, despite the availability of material from the eighteenth century to the present day, the worship of the goddess prior to the colonial presence still remains to a great extent terra incognita. Sanskrit paddhatis (ritual manuals) from the medieval era are among the few records available from Bengal that shed light on the pedagogical and performative context of the rite. The purpose of this article is to provide a synchronic sketch of the medieval ceremony based on the influential and widely cited medieval manual, the Durgãpújãtattva ("The truth concerning the rite of Durgã", henceforth DPT) of Raghunandana Bhattãcãrya (i 520-1 575 ce)3 supported by parallel accounts of the rite contained in related literature. The sketch will be used as a broad framework to illustrate the manner in which the ceremony was performed or could have been performed in Bengal during the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries ce. While the article presents a largely empirical study of a particular ritual text, it aims to show that this work was not composed in a vacuum but within a broader historical context. In order to understand properly and appreciate a text like the DPT, which at first sight misleadingly strikes one as a pedantic work of little theoretical or historical value, it is important to study in tandem: (i) the network of related texts and (ii) the ritual/performative history of which it is a part and which it implicitly narrates. The broader tasks of uncovering this implicit *My sincere gratitude to Prof. Alexis Sanderson, my doctoral supervisor at the time I wrote this article, for reading the Durgãpújãtattva with me, and illuminating various obscurities in the work.

Regarding these matters, I cannot claim to have been exhaustive. I have merely attempted to lay the groundwork for a fuller cultural query Before a more elaborate exposition is carried out, it is essential to complete the basic task of preparing and presenting the material. With this aim, the article presents in Part 3 , an emended transcript accompanied by an annotated English translation of the main rites of the DPT, previously only available in Sanskrit. Given the paucity of descriptive documents on ancient India such as letters, biographies, eye-witness accounts, diaries etc., prescriptive material forms one of the few detailed historical records of religious praxis. It is not unreasonable to extract paradigms regarding rituals from paddhatis for, as defined by the tradition, they are systematised distillations of their more authoritative, but remote and at times lacunose, scriptural sources. These scriptures ultimately guide all religious ceremonies within Brahmanism, a religion that, from its most archaic manifestation in the Vedas, has privileged sacred text in sanctioning all matters of doctrine and practice. According to the learned medieval exegete Bhatta Rãmakantha: For any scripture a Paddhati is a text which enables the performance of the rituals [of that scripture] along with the Mantras [that accompany them] by succinctly arranging in the order [of performance] (i) the [instructions] explicitly stated [in that scripture but] dispersed in various places [throughout its length], and (ii) whatever [else] those explicit statements imply An example is the Yajñasütra in the case of the [Kãthaka] Yajurveda'.4 The paddhati therefore bears, a direct relationship to practice (prayoga ). Although dryly prescriptive in approach, the relevance of paddhati literature is by no means meagre. The beauty of a work like the DPT lies in what it does not explicate: behind the pedantry, prescriptions and ritual jargon, ranges, as backdrop, a whole un-inscribed world of ritual performance, pageantry, utterance and gesture whose full impact, like theatre, can only occur at the moment of its enactment. The paddhati is therefore the "script" for this grand theatre, and though we will never see the action as it originally unfolded on stage, we can, with the aid of this script, intelligently and, I think, correctly, imagine how, and even why, that drama manifested in history. At the outset it must be acknowledged that the picture they present is, at best, generalised. Much like dramatic scripts, these texts are to be understood as providing only a guideline for they were inevitably supplemented by additional ritual details particular to a lineage and household. Nevertheless they do form for the performer the binding essence of the rite, the sacred "blueprint" underlying all customisations. One can easily argue that there is a danger in this reliance on paddhatis , for like scripture they may well reflect an ideal; and whether what they prescribed truly did occur can be anybody's guess. On the other hand, inscriptional evidence from South East Asia unequivocally demonstrating the relevance of paddhatis in shaping praxis significantly challenges this view. The Khmer kingdom has left behind several inscriptions recording how prescriptive literature from India guided the ceremonies performed for the state: the inscriptions of Banteay Srei of 1306 andjayavarman II (802-835 ce) being particularly revelatory of the use 4 Sarvatrisatikalottaravrttih, p. 45, 11. 6-7; Translation by Sanderson 2003-2004, pp. 356-357, n.19.: also see Sanderson 2003-2004, p. 353.</page><page sequence="3">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 327 of paddhatis in the domain of the court. The first inscription, for instance, is an ordinance commanding the incumbents of Khnãr Grañ to worship the deity following the verses of a vrah pañjiy (Sacred Manual) dealing with worship at the sacred sites ( ksetropacãra ); the second reporting that, under the auspices of King Jayavarman II, the Brãhmana Hiranyadãma performed a state-ritual founding the independent Khmer kingdom of Angkor and developed the cult of Devarãja for Jayavarman s court by extracting in a paddhati the core elements of the Vinãsikha scripture of the Vamašrotas doctrinal current of the Saiva canon.5 Admittedly such precise evidence for the impact of the medieval paddhatis of the Durgä Püjä on actual practice is unknown, a rare exception being the Durgâbhaktitaraûginï of Vidyãpati which, from the dedicatory verses to the Maithila King Dhlrasimha at the end, demonstrates its influence over the Navarätra ceremony at the court of the Oinwar lineage of Mithilã (discussed in greater detail later). But there is evidence of an indirect kind showing that such literature did indeed shape the performance of the Durgä Püjä: we have, for instance, the testimony of current Durgä Püjä rites such as those performed by the Bengali brãhmana clan of the Lahiris of Varanasi (studied by Rodrigues 2003) or those given in the encyclopaedic Purohita Darpana6, the manual currently most widely followed in Bengal. These in most of their particulars conform very closely to the rubric described in the medieval paddhatis , preserving the basic rituals and their order over the successivie tithis of the bright first quarter of Ãsvina and the same litany, still recited during modern performances. There is therefore a continuity with the medieval ritual tradition. For instance, in rites such as awakening the goddess in a bilva tree ( bodhana ), cutting the bilva branch, warding away ghosts from the ritual space, installing the ancillary spells (&lt; anganyãsa ), the summoning ( âvâhana ) of the goddess, infusing the vital breaths (prânapratisthã), the meditation ( dhyãna ) verses and others, the mantras chanted by the priest are to be traced in the DPT. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the medieval paddhatis had a prolific afterlife, being diligently copied and circulated up to the eighteenth century in a number of manuscripts (I have so far encountered three complete manuscripts of the DPT and four of the Durgâbhaktitaraûginï not used by the editors of the printed texts), demonstrating that the scribal tradition obviously felt they needed to be preserved for use. A break with the past only seems to have appeared in the growing brahmanisation of the current rites. These tend to diminish the once-predominant Tantric element by incorporating more Vedic verses; display Durgä primarily as a serene and benevolent matriarch in an image accompanied by the gods Kärttikeya, Ganeša, Laksmï and Sarasvatï who are designated as her family (though her depictions throughout the early medieval literature conceive of her in stark contrast as a potentially threatening deity attended by female acolytes, rather than a family); show hesitation in animal sacrifice (where the previous rites enjoin many buffaloes, goats, rams and even human heads, the present rite usually involves no more than a goat);7 do away with the caste dissolving Festival of Savaras (Sãvoratsava) once performed at the end of the medieval rite; and diminish the presence of ferocious, ambivalent forms of Durgä connected with Kãll. 5The evidence of the Khmer Kingdom is from Sanderson 2003-2004, pp. 353; 355~357- K.C. Smrtitïrtha 1922, pp. 222-280. 7 See Rodrigues 2003, p. 215 for an observant summary of present attititudes towards animal sacrifice in the Durgä Püjä.</page><page sequence="4">328 Bihani Sarkar Whatever concerns one may harbour about the dangers in drawing conclusions about real practice from normative literature, it is important nevertheless to start placing this textual corpora within a historical context, to unravel their ritual syntax, to understand what they are trying to say and how that syntax was translated into gesture in the sphere of ritual. The task of interpretation must be done, and the dangers risked. Indeed, the problems in interpretation can be resolved by reading widely around a paddhati (for read in isolation it yields little meaning), reading the literature with which the author has familiarity and being aware of current practices that may preserve elements or modified elements of the tradition referred to by the author. If approached with caution, good sense and an awareness of related literature, prescriptive compositions can provide valuable and intriguing insights into how deities were conceptualised in cults, how their relation to men was enacted in ritual practice, what was necessary for the performance of their ritual, who was performing them and for whom they were being performed. Taking into account these factors, I have sketched a provisional paradigm in the analytical parts of the article that suggests rather than states, attempting not to overstretch my interpretation. The Social and Literary Contexts of the DurgãpUjãtattva and the Medieval Autumnal Rite From the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, a significant number of manuals on the Durgã Püjä were composed in Mithilã and Bengal, indicating that during this period there was a rise in demand for the püjä. An already thriving tradition of goddess worship and a conservative reaction to the ruling Muslim power may have added impetus to this growth. The writers of these works were smãrta brahmins - the predominant religious elite in Mithilã and Bengal - codifiers and commentators of the vast body of secondary Brahminical literature known as smrti. Prior to the smãrta compositions, the pedagogical history of the Durgã Püjä remains largely obscure, and it is difficult to know the form of the worship that was most widely taught to ritual-specialists. Although Purãnic passages on the festival of the goddess abound, they are dispersed, patchy and difficult to date given that the Purãnas themselves are mostly protean and composite texts that have mutated and grown over periods of time.8 Before it was systematised by the smãrta panditas , there were various versions of the rite. It probably differed in detail from region to region and kingdom to kingdom. There must have been private manuals and traditions in every kingdom customised to suit the particular needs of courts and communities. Locally influential goddesses with individual personalities and cults were worshipped as unique forms of Durgã with distinctive versions of the Navarãtra, which led to a great degree of diversity and autonomy in the rite. The codification and intellectualisation (discussions on categorisation, time etc.) of the püjä began in earnest from the medieval period (twelfth century ce onwards) when, as we shall see, the smãrtas began a concerted effort to formulate a universal programme and a textual basis of authority for the rite which remains largely intact even today. Before their appropriation of the ritual 8Einoo 1999 has comprehensively tabulated all the passages known so far in Purãnic literature on the Durgã Püjä. P.V. Kane 1994 is by far the most thorough treatment of the autumnal Navarãtra, although his study is not historicised in approach.</page><page sequence="5">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 329 within brahminical exegetical discourse in the twelfth century, the Durgä Püjä had hardly been commented upon by scholars writing in Sanskrit. For the purpose of this article, I have therefore restricted my study of the rite to this period that marked the efflorescence of learned literature on the Durgä Püjä, and its attainment of a more uniform structure. Of the two layers of Brahminical orthodoxy, the smãrtas are the second and more catholic layer. The first, known as the šrautas , are experts in the literature collectively called sruti, the primary scriptures of the Brahmins consisting of the four Vedas. They are taught to maintain the sacred fires throughout their lives by uninterrupted offerings of Vedic oblations. The importance of the Vedic ritual is thus fundamental to the srauta , deities being merely nominal in worship and not the means of salvation. The smãrtas are, in contrast, theistic in their approach. For instance they include the worship of five gods from the Purãnas (Sürya, Šiva, Ganeša, Durgä, Visnu) into the regular rituals, holding them in high regard while at the same time avoiding sectarian partisanship to any one deity. Thus between the highest strata of Brahminical orthodoxy and the various sects that give importance to specific gods, theirs is the middle ground. They are considered experts on the smrti (hence smãrta ), the secondary scriptures of the Brahmins comprising the Purãnas that contain ancient legends on, among other topics, the deities of their regular worship, a complex and large body of rituals not included in the Vedic texts, histories and genealogies. Apart from the Purãnas, the smrti- texts also comprise the law books on which the ethical order of the Hindus are based (dharmasãstra) . These as well as the epics, the Mahãbhãrata and the Rãmãyana , also fell in the purview of smãrta intellectual activity. The smãrta influence on orthodox religious practice is evidenced in that by the late medieval period, they had overtaken the šrautas as the majority orthodox group, and while the religion followed by the šrautas was by no means defunct, it did represent an older faith that was rapidly being superceded by the expansion of the smrti literature and the faith promoted therein. This Purãnic and epic religious tradition incorporated local customs such as particular sacred sites (tïrthas), local deities and their shrines, festivals and Tantricised rituals. It was eclec- tic, unlike the šrauta faith which clung resiliently to the ancient Vedic sacrifice. Raghunandana Bhattãcãrya, the author of the DPT, was himself an eminent and prolific scholar of this oeuvre. Composed in a theistic and assimilative spirit, the DPT describes and codifies for Brahminical use the ten-day autumnal worship of Durgä in Bengal, drawing primarily on the Purãnas for scriptural authority but also referring, surprisingly, to a few Tantras9 in a demonstration of its inclusive approach. It is the most elaborate of all the Bengali smãrta manuals on the Durgä Püjä and, true to the spirit of a paddhati , is a "path" both through the thorny fields of scripture (in its opening Pramãna section) and the obscurities of ritual minutieae (in its closing Prayoga section) . For the reader it thus gives the richest and most comprehensive idea of the medieval rite and this was the main reason why I examined the work for this article. The political milieu of eastern India at the time was favourable for the composition of all sorts of religious treatises. Mithilã- the region straddling the Bengal-Bihar border - flourished as an independent Hindu kingdom. Bengal on the other hand was divided into many smaller political units and had a strong and long tradition of local government, first under the ^ There are four references to a Durgatantra, two to the Saradatilaka and one to a Gavaksatantra in the Pramãna section of the DPT.</page><page sequence="6">330 Bihani Sarkar Afghans and then under the Mughals from 1575 onwards. Twelve of these self-governing territories were called bhuinyas. Owing to little control from the Centre, they enjoyed virtual independence and often violently opposed overlordship.10 Besides the bhuinyas , a number of smaller landlords ( zamindãrs ), both Hindus and Muslims, also held power. They held hereditary rights over their land and considered themselves independent rulers. It was in this context of diverse regional powers that scholars of smrti literature attained influence in various parts of Bengal and in the Mithilã court as formulators of Hindu temporal and religious law. Raghunandana himself authored no fewer than twenty-eight treatises he titled "Tattvas", literally "Verities", on a range of subjects with bearing on legislature and proper Brahminical etiquette; while in the court of Mithilã, the author Vidyãpati, in the footsteps of his ancestor Candešvara Thakkura, wrote, as resident scholar and minister, a number of similar tomes for the benefit of the state. The broad and inclusive patronage network in both regions supported their work. Many local rãjãs made large endowments to Sanskrit scholars. So highly regarded was the smãrta opinion on social norms, that in Bengal there is even evidence that a smãrta was patronised by a Muslim king, one Brhaspati Rãyamukuta who belonged to the court of the King Jalãl-ud-dln (1418 CE-1431Œ) and composed many smrti works under his patronage.11 The main impact of the work of the smãrtas affected the laws of inheritance - an area of crucial interest for this body of kings and gentry. The Dãyatattva , a commentary on Jlmütavähana s influential legal treatise the Dãyabhãga , was, for instance, Raghunandana's contribution to medieval inheritance legislation. Besides inheritance, all manner of topics were covered by the smãrtas impacting the private life of an individual, such as pilgrimages, the proper time for religious observances, ceremonial purification, marriage, post-mortuary rites (srãddha) and even the most personal actions such as when to copulate with one's wife, hygiene, ablutions, conduct while bathing etc. Framing their axioms in encyclopaedic works called nibandhas (digests), the smãrtas authorised an exhaustive programme of observances for the Hindu householder to maintain in his life. All the most important smãrtas of the time had composed at least one work on Durgã worship, drawing mainly from passages attributed to the Devi Purãna, Kãlikã Purãna, Visnudharmottara Purãna, Bhavisya Purãna, the Brhannandikesvara and/or Nandikesvara Purãna(s) and other smãrta-c ompositions to guide their ritual programmes.12 These discussions on the goddess's rite are often included as chapters in the very digests the smãrtas had authored to codify the legal and religious practices of Indian kingdoms. This shows that the rite of the goddess was viewed as being essential to the calendrical ritual cycle of a Hindu kingdom, for it was accorded status among the religious principles thought to underlie Brahminical government. As early as the twelfth century, a chapter quoting in verbatim the Mahãnavamí rites from the Devïpurâna appeared in the Rãjadharmakãnda (Chapter on the Duties of a King) 10Ralph Fitch who visited Bengal in 1586 writes: "They be all hereabouts rebels against their Jalaluddin Akbar for here are so many rivers and islands that they flee from one another whereby his horsemen cannot prevail against them" (quoted in A.C. Roy 1968, p. 55). B. Bhattacarya 1955, p. 29. As the erudite Kane notes, "There is a voluminous literature on the Durgotsava. Every digest on vratas, tithis and püjä devotes considerable space on this subject. Moreover there are special treatises ..."

It is in the east though, that the first elaborate ritual programmes, involving a spectacular build-up over ten lunar days in the month of Ãsvina ending in the MahãstamI, Navami and DašamI triad, appear. In Mithilä, Candešvara Thakkura included in the Krtyaratnãkara (13 14 ce -1324 ce),13 the most famous of his "Jewel Mines" or "Oceans", a lengthy 135 pages on goddess rites spread over the entire month of Ãsvina, beginning from the dark eighth and continuing up to the bright tenth.14 In Bengal, the earliest works preceding and influencing Raghunandana were the chapter "Ascertaining the Rite of Durgã" (Durgotsavanirnaya) from the Kãlaviveka of Jlmütavähana (11 00 ce - 1150 ce)15, indeed the earliest smãrta to proselytise the Durgä Püjä, and the Durgotsavaviveka of Sülapäni (1375 ce - 1460 ce)16, a treatise on the autumnal worship which quotes Jlmütavähana and thus was later than him. In addition, Sülapäni also composed the VãsantTviveka , a treatise on the three- tithi spring worship of Durgã in Caitra. These are concise and learned treatises formed of, according to the norm of paddhatis, sequential citations spread throughout scriptures selected to add muscle to the programmes advocated by the authors, with elaboration provided in between. In the interim between Sülapäni s work and the DPT, further discussions on the püjä appeared in a chapter in the Krtyacintãmani of Vãcaspati Misra (1425CE - 1480 ce). Raghunandana s teacher Srínãtha Ãcãryacúdãmani (1470 ce -1540 ce), who wrote the Krtyatattvãrnava," An Ocean of Verities on Ritual Duties" was also the author of a Durgã Püjä treatise.17 The main purpose of all these works seems to have been formulating a systematic programme based on Purãnic authorities. Given, as we have seen, the pedigree of the smãrtas as legislators, their endorsement of the püjä would have added considerably to its brahmanical credibility and consequent popularity among brahmanical kings. The smãrta work to have most influence on the DPT, as it indeed did on others such as Vãcaspati Misra,18 was the Durgâbhaktitaranginï ("A River of Devotion to Durgã") of Vidyãpati (1375 ce - 1450 ce) a court treatise composed sometime in the fifteenth century for the Oinwar lineage at Mithilã. Vidyãpati is chiefly famous for his poetic compositions in the Maithill language, but he was at the same time actively engaged in composing sãstric literature in Sanskrit. His Durgâbhaktitaranginï gives us a clear idea of how a courtly Durgã püjä may have been conducted in medieval East India. Roughly equalling the length of Raghu- nandana s work, it is one of the more elaborate Durgã püjä manuals to have been written in the period, for it not only gives citations (in the first part) like the former works but also more detailed instructions to the reader (in the second). In addition to the rites mentioned by Sülapäni, it includes Tantricised rituals of power - a first among the smãrta manuals - perhaps tailored specially for the ruling Maithila lineage. Thus it seems that in the interim between Jlmütavähana s and Vidyãpati s works, the Durgã Püjä may have developed its ritual repertoire so that by the time Raghunandana s DPT appeared sometime in the sixteenth century, the autumnal worship was - in scale and importance - a notable event in Bengal. 13For Candesvara's dates see Introduction to The Skanda Purana, 1998, p. 12; B.

Kamalãkara Bhatta, who lived and worked in Varanasi, author of the Nirnayasindhu and uncle of Gãgãbhatta the architect of Sivãjls Vedic coronation19, quotes profusely from the ' ' Gaudanibandhas in his chapter on the ãsvinanavarãtra , citing Purãnic passages sourced from Vidyãpati, Srinãtha or Raghunandana, thereby teaching rites taken directly from them. Some of the Durgä Püjä rites codified in his work on the authority of these Gaudas are as follows: (i) the worship of the goddess between pratipat to pancamï (based on the Bhavisya Purãna from the DurgãbhaktitaraúginT: atha pratipadãdisu viseso durgãbhaktitaraúginyãm bhavisye); (ii) bodhana in a bilva tree on sasthï (Devi Purãna from the Gaudanibandhas: gaudanibandhe devïpurâne); (iii) patrikãpravesana (based on Srinãtha s Krtyatattvãrnava: patrikãpãjã . . . iti krtyatattvãrnave uktam); (iv) the mãrtisthãpana (based on the Devi Purãna from the DurgãbhaktitaraúginT and the Kãlikã Purãna from the Krtyatattvãrnava : devïmûrtisthâpane viseso durgãbhaktitaraúginyãm devïpurâne and krtyatattvãrnave kãlikãpurãne); (v) homas on navamï with the mantra beginning "JayantI Mangalã Kãll etc." (based on the DurgãbhaktitaraúginT and others: durgãbhaktitaraúginyãdigaudagranthesv api navamyãm homa uktah and durgãbhaktitaraúginyãm tu tilair jayantïmantrena ca homa uktah) vi) visarjana on Vijaya DasamI (based on the Devi Purãna from the DurgãbhaktitaraúginT: dasamyãm devïm visarjayet. tad uktam durgãbhaktitaraúginyãm devïpurâne); (vi) nTrãjana of an army at the tail end of DasamI and the auspicious sighting of a white wagtail (based on the Jyotisa from the Bengali nibandhas : gaudanibandhe jyotise) . 20 There may have been several reasons why the smãrtas chose to write so many Durgä Püjä treatises. First, Sãktism was well-entrenched in the religious traditions of Mithilã and Bengal, and in the literature of the brahmanical authors of those places can be viewed a reflection of the local Sãkta current. Among the vast body of religious customs that were codified by the Bengali and Maithila smãrtas the only "deity-specific" works are indeed on Durgã [as opposed to works on Siva worship or Visnu worship]. Given the prevalence of Sãktism in the region, there must have existed a high demand for the rite of the goddess among rich, landed local patrons who required manuals for their households. The treatises must have been written in part to serve the interests of these local patrons. For, as Bhatta Rãmakantha had observed, paddhatis are only written for their practical application in ritual. Second, the Gauda smãrtas were the first to proselytise rites in the ãsvinapUjã particular to Kämarüpa, Bengal and Mithilã that were not performed elsewhere in India, such as the south or the west, before their codifi- cation by these authors. This suggests that the promotion and elevation of a ritual programme indigenous to that region may have formed, consciously or unconsciously, a motive for the composition of these works. As Hazra has demonstrated, verses on the rites preceding AstamI beginning with the goddess's adornment from the First (pratipat) to the Fifth (pancamï), her adhivãsana and bodhana in the bilva tree, her worship in nine leaves (patrikãpãjã ), the tying of the nine leaves with an aparãjitã creeper, the visarjana in water and the performance of the sãvarotsava are missing from the nibandhas authored in southern and western India, and 19 For historical analyses of Gãgãbhatta s role and the complete text of the coronation see Bendrey i960. Nirnayasindhu, p. 613 {pratipat to pancamï); p. 617 ( bodhana on sasthï ); 623 (patrikapravesana ); 627 (devïmûrtisthâpana); 655, 657 ( homas on Navami); 672 {visarjana)-, 679 (balaritrãjana) .</page><page sequence="9">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 333 even in works from parts closer to Bengal such as Orissa.21 Hazra argues that the early smrti writers of western and southern India had no knowledge of the verses describing these rites while later authors discuss them on the authority of an East Indian source, such as we find in the case of Kamaläkara in his acknowledgement of the "Gaudanibandhas" with regard to the rites of the Pratipat-PañcamI sequence and the bodhana. Three of the Purãnas cited as the sources for this tradition by the eastern authors - the Kalika, the Nandikesvara and the Brhannandikešvara - were mostly popular in the East, being either unknown in the West, or made known to western and southern authors by the Gaudas. Out of these, the Kalika concerns the sacred geography of Kämarüpa and thus indubitably betrays an Assamese orientation. With regard to the mysterious and now lost Nandikesvara and Brhannandikešvara Purãnas, Hazra notes that the smrti writers of Bengal and Orissa were the first to recognise and utilise their contents. Among them, only the Bengalis cited these Purãnas in connection with the Durgã Püjä. Citations from these Purãnas were used by the Gaudas particularly in relation to Durgã s adhivãsana in a bilva tree on the evening of sasthï and the worship of the navapatrikã. Raghunandana himself quotes on six occasions from a Nandikesvara Purãna and (though both may be the same work) a Brhannandikešvara in the Pramãna section, most importantly attributing the offering of the navapatrikã to these scriptures ( nandikesvarapurãnãt bilvapatrãdikam api deyam). It is for instance from the Brhannandikešvara that the verse naming the nine leaves is cited in the Pramãna part of the DPT: atra brhannandikesvarapurãnam:22 saptamyãm patrikã püjyä rambhãdinavabhir yutã | rambhã kaccï haridrã cajayantï bilvadãdimau || ašoko mãnakas caiva dhãnyaã ca nava patrikãh ' mahïtnayï ca mãrtir me putrãyurdhanavrddhaye ' On this matter, the Brhannandikšvara Purãna [states] : On SaptamI a [nonet] of leaves must be worshipped accompanied by Rambhã etc.23 The Nine Leaves are the plantain (rambha), kaccï, turmeric ( haridra ), barley (jayantí ), Aegle marmelos (bilva), pomegranate, asoka, Arum indicum ( mãnaka ) and rice. A clay image of myself [must] also [be worshipped] for sons, long life and wealth. Given the celebrity of the Nandikešvara/ Brhannandikešvara, primarily in the East, the worship of the nine leaves was clearly a custom prevalent in that region (the nine must have been connected in some way to the nine nights of the Navarãtra). Hazra perceptively notes that western authors betrayed their unfamiliarity with the navapatrikã : In treating of the navapatrikãpãjã Kamaläkara quotes this verse [see above] . . . but reads 'kavi for 'kaccx and ' mãna-vrksas ca [for 1 mãnaka] clearly showing that neither Kamaläkara nor his countrymen were familiar with kaccï and mãna. The learned editor of the Nirnayasindhu frankly admits that he did not understand what objects were meant by the words ' mãna ' and ' kavi 21 Hazra 1963, pp. 2-15. 22 The use of Nandikesvara for Brhannandikešvara in this part of the DPT also appears in manuscripts, hence it is probable that both might be the same work. 23 1 am aware of the problems with the Sanskrit, but this is what the intended meaning appears to be.</page><page sequence="10">334 Bihani Sarkar occuring in the text of the Nirnayasindhu. Now the word ' kaca . . . has been used in the above verse to mean the 'kacu plant so well known in Bengal, Mithilã and Kãmampa its peculiar spelling 'cc' is common in the Bengal Nibandhas . . . The mãnaka (popularly called ' mãna or mãnakacu in Bengal) is one of the varieties of arum. As neither kaccï nor mãnaka is mentioned in the Amarakosa or any other famous lexicon, Kamalãkara and his countrymen as well as the learned editor of the printed text of the Nirnayasindhu totally failed to understand their meaning and made the mistakes mentioned above.24 Hazra even suspected that certain verses used by the Gaudas were spurious and although the harvest rites were practiced as local custom, an authoritative source had to be invented where none could be found in scripture. He goes as far as to suggest that the authors of the East Indian manuals doctored verses from the Bhavisya and Liñga Purãnas and used them as genuine citations: We can reasonably presume therefore that chapters consisting of verses on the methods of the Durgä Püjä as followed in Bengal were written by scholars of this province and inserted into the texts of the Bhavisya and the Liñga Puräna current among them so that these methods though determined mostly by local customs of Bengal might be regarded as based on authoritative sãstric injunctions.25 That the Southern smrti- authors were unaware of these passages from the version of those Purãnas available to them serves to emphasise this point. Most western works composed after Raghunandana, such as the Purusãrthacintãmani by the western Visnubhatta (whose clan hailed from Patan in Gujarat), do not discuss the Pratipat-Pañcamí adornment rites, the sãvarotsava and the visarjana in water at all, leading to the strong possibility that such rites were not popular outside Bengal after their codification by the Gaudas. Their variable presence in later literature from the western regions of India confirms the eastern provenance of these, rituals that in some mode or form venerate the goddess as the essence of creative energy pervading the natural world (see Part 2). The western tradition, as we shall see later, did not emphasise this harvest aspect of the Durgä Püjä in contrast to the eastern custom. It could also have been the case that separate recensions of these Purãnas were available to the Gaudas.26 Since different versions of the Purãnas were customarily used by different authors, the smãrtas were very careful to identify which version they were using in their citations. One finds these identifications made often before verse-citations in such forms as hemãdrau skãnde (the Skanda Puräna from Hemãdri) or a tithitattve laiňge (the Liñga Puräna from [Raghunandana s] Tithitattva) . These were not gratuitous comments but evidence of exegetical precision where many canons proliferated. What seems the likelier possibility is that the rites described above were always associated with the Navarãtra of the eastern regions, at least from the time of their documentation in their source Purãnas, but were unknown outside these parts (or rather the sections in the Purãnas containing them were unknown), until their codification from the twelfth century onwards by the eastern smãrtas beginning with the earliest, Jlmütavähana. 24 Ibid, pp. 10-11. э Hazra, 1963, p. 14. Only a careful study of the manuscript transmissions of these Purãnas will succeed in throwing more light on this mystery. For the time being both Hazra's contention and mine are hypotheses awaiting greater clarity.</page><page sequence="11">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 335 The eastern rites of the Navarãtra and a chronology of their codification BY THE SMÀRTAS: &lt; = drawing on 1125-1150 CE: Worship of goddess in a bilva tree (possibly Eastern, see below): Jimütavähana &lt; = Liñga Purãna 1 1 25-1 150 CE: Sãvarotsava on DašamI: Jimütavähana &lt; = Kãlikã Purãna 13 14-1324 CE: Worship of the nine Durgäs in a diagram: Candešvara &lt; = source not stated, possibly a version of the Agni Purãna &lt; = Skandayãmala (see below) 13 14-1460 CE: Worship of the nine leaves on SaptamI: Candešvara &lt; = source not identified; Vidyãpati &lt; = Brhannandikešvara; Sülapäni &lt; = Brhannandikešvara 1375-1460 CE: Rites of adornment from Pratipat to PañcamI: Sülapäni &lt; = Bhavisya Purãna; Vidyãpati &lt; = Bhavisya Purãna 1 375 - 1460 CE: The goddess's Visaijana in water: Vidyãpati &lt; = Kãlikã Purãna; Sülapäni &lt; = Brhannandikešvara Among these rites, only the bodhana in a bilva tree is possibly eastern. This is because, though generally absent in early western and southern treatises, the ritual is discussed on a rare occasion in the twelfth-century Caturvargacintãmani of Hemãdri of Devagiri,27 indicating that the custom was known among a few outside Bengal during Jimütavähana s time. Hazra, refuting this possibility, was of the opinion that this western author probably sourced the rite from an east Indian work28 (op. cit., p. 4, n. 13). More evidence on this ritual is needed. As for the set of nine leaves, though eastern, they appear to be a fairly new entrant to the scheme of the Bengali rite. Jimütavähana, the earliest writer on the eastern rite, understood the nine leaves differently: for he interprets " patrikã " in the phrase saptamyãm patrikäpüjä (leaf worship on the seventh) to mean a bilva leaf: patrikã bilvasãkhã ( Durgäpüjäviveka , p. 31), rather than the nine crops cited by the other Gaudas. This means that prior to the publication of the Brhannandikešvara verse by Vidyãpati and Sülapäni (authors later than Jimütavähana), either the worship of leaves on SaptamI was centred on the bilva alone (and given the strong Säkta-Saivite association of the bel , this would not be surprising), or the nine leaves formed an undocumented local custom prevalent in Bengali villages. Though unnoticed by Hazra, the worship of nine forms of Durgã on Mahästaml in a drawn diagram, beginning with Rudracandä in the east, is also a tradition particular to the east, originating in the literature of Mithilã. Candešvara Thakkura is the first to discuss it at length, stipulating the drawing of the goddesses in a circuit ( mandalãkãrena ) or in a straight line (rjupaňktya) }9 Without identifying the source, he cites a verse remarkably similar to an Agni Purãna passage (see below in Part 3) and this mysterious passage attributes the tradition of the mandalic nine Durgäs to a Skandayãmala , a work unknown to me. The cited line where this attribution is made states sthãpyã vrttena paúktyã vã ity uktam skandayãmale (The [goddesses] must be installed in a circle or a line - such is taught in the Skandayãmala. This work was obviously Tantric, for Candešvara understands it to mean "a particular ãgama " (skandayãmala ãgamavisesó) . It must have been under the auspices of Candešvara that the Nava Durgäs were 27 Caturvargacintamani, vol. 2.1 (Vratakhanda), pp. 900-921. Hazra, 1963, p. 4, n. 13.

The first Gauda to refer to the Navadurgäpüjä is Raghunandana, and thus the worship appears to have filtered during the sixteenth century through Mithilã into Bengal, where it has now ossified into the rite of the lotus-shaped sarvatobhadramandala, still performed in most Bengali Durgã Pûjâs. But it never percolated to the west, perhaps on account of its Tantric overtone, for none of the western authors, even after Raghunandana discuss it. Finally, the Sãvarotsava formed an ancient and exclusively eastern tradition celebrating VijayadasamI as it is never associated with western and southern rites, even by the later western smãrtas after Raghunandana.31 Instead, the more militarised tradition attributed to the Gopathabrãhmana outside Bengal, represented by such authors as Hemãdri32 , Kamalãkara, Visnubhatta Äthavale and southern treatises such as SãmrãjyalaksmTpTthikã of anonymous authorship, celebrated this auspicious tithi with the worship of a samt tree on the outskirts of the town and the worship of Aparãjitã, goddess of victory and her attendants Jayã and Vijayã. Like the sãvarotsava , the samïpûjâ was a civic rite involving all citizens, but unlike the egali tarianism of its eastern counterpart where all men temporarily became equal and casteless for a day, the samïpûjâ could only be performed by a royal personage in his representative capacity while leading the community and the troops.33 Aparãjitã- worship for protection and victory on the eve of battle survived in the Maithila Navarãtra but never appeared in Bengal. On the whole it would seem that the east had or developed a strong tradition of harvest rites centred in the six days between the First (pratipat) to the Seventh (saptamî) honouring the goddess as an embodiment of fecundity, coupled with Tantricised rituals preceding 30 Vivãdaratnãkara, pp. 670-671. srtkrtyadãnavyavahãrasuddhipújãvivãdesu grhasthakrtye ' ratnãkarã dharmabhuvo nibandhãh krtãs tulãpurusadena sapta ' rasagunabhujacandraih sammite sãkavarse sahasi dhavalapakse vâgmatïsindhutîre I adita tulitam uccair ãtmanã svarnarãsim nidhir akhilagunãnãm uttarah somanãthah | [cited in Introduction to The Skandapurãna , Vol I, p. 12 cited in Introduction to The Skandapurãna, Vol I, Dãnaratnãkara in Jayaswal's Introduction to Râjanïtiratnâkara, p. k.] Indeed Hazra, op. cit., pp. 10- 11 in a further perspicuous observation notes: "In two verses of which one is derived from Kamalãkara from the Durgãbhaktitaraúgim and the other from the Kãlikã Purãna, the reading 'sãravotsavaih' is given in place of 'sävarotsavaih'.

A king accompanied by his citizens, having gone to a samí tree on the eastern border of the capital, would worship the guardians of the ten quarters and perform a vãstupujã on the tree. This was because, as far as the conventional nirukti in the hymn suggests, a samí tree was meant to bring an end (šamamm) to inauspicious elements and evil deeds: mantravaidikapauränaih püjayec ca samxtarum. amaúgalãnãm samanïm samanïm duskrtasya ca. duhkhaprasamanïm etc. Purusãrthacintãmani p. 186. Then, having sung benedictory verses, the king would stride ( kramet ) to the east, in a gesture symbolic of his mastery over the Earth, make an image of his enemy, contemplate it in his mind and then strike the opponent s heart with an arrow. The same procedure was followed for each of the directions, followed by a lavish and ornate procession of the king's horses, elephants, foot soldiers and various colourful spectacles. Next, the king was to worship the goddess Aparãjitã (she who is unconquered) with her attendants Jayã and Vijayã in the north-eastern corner of a village. The rite was performed for the goddess's protection and the bestowal of victory.</page><page sequence="13">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 337 and complementing the warrior rites of Mahãstaml-Mahãnavaml. With the unprecedented efflorescence in smãrta literature on the topic, many of these rites (with the exception of the sãvarotsava and the navadurgäpüja) were circulated among smãrtas outside Bengal, Mithilã and Kämarüpa and added to the established curriculum of autumnal goddess worship. Side by side with the fecundity of the goddess, a key feature highlighted in these Eastern ritual texts - particularly in early writers like Candesvara, Jlmütavähana and Vidyãpati and to a lesser extent even in Raghunandana's work - is Durgã s role as a granter and legitimiser of royal power. Her ritual worship was connected to augmenting the power of a ruler and his kingdom. A parallel can be found in early medieval Saivism- as demonstrated by Sanderson, Šaivism created ties with the state by developing Saiva rituals that enhanced the power of the king.34 As the lineage goddess of many kings, Durgã or a goddess assimilated with Durgã, contributed to their distinction, was spiritually linked to the successes of their clans and publicly worshipped during the autumnal festival during which time kings would renew their ties with the state by inaugurating the military year with splendid court ceremonies honouring the goddess.35 Indeed scholars such as Gupta and Gombrich have remarked on the interplay between the martial Devi, kings and power.36 Such a role is not without attestation in scriptural and secular literature composed in the medieval era, particular in the Purãnas, where Durgã is held to be of particular importance for the attainment and preservation of kingship, the favours granted by her to the mythical rulers Suratha, Rãma and the Pãndavas being a few examples in legend and the epics portraying this regal role.37 Although the scriptures emphasise that the worship of Durgã is "democratic", so that all the four castes (the Südra is also included in the DPT, see 3. i), and even those deemed outsiders or reprehensible, are able, at least in theory, to perform her püjä ,38 in practice it had, from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries ce, tended to benefit one the most - the warrior (, ksatriya ), especially a sovereign. We know, for instance, from the ending to Vidyãpati s influential Durgãbhaktitaraúgim, that it was composed for his patron King Dhlrasimha of the Oinwar lineage who ruled Mithilã from 1326 to 1526 ce.39 This ancient connection between the goddess and the kings "kingship" underlies the Durgã Püjä paddhatis written in medieval east India where, particularly in the early strata 34 "[The Šaivas] were prepared to consolidate their position in the world [. . .] by tying themselves to the monarch and the monarch to them, in particular by giving Šaiva initiation to the king, promoting this as a key element in the ceremonies that legitimated his office and added to his regal lustre" Sanderson (forthcoming) p. 2. The connection between goddess worship and the Hindu kingdoms of medieval Orissa has been explored by Kulke 1995 and Eschmann 1978. Gupta and Gombrich, 1986. 37 This forms the subject of my D.Phil dissertation (Sarkar 201 1).

Conventionally, the festival would initiate the new military year. Kings in princely states of Rajasthan, such as Mewar, the Vijayanagara Empire in the south, the Marãtha kingdom in the west, and closer to the east, in Mithilã and Cooch-Behar, celebrated and ritually constituted their power with grand Navarãtra festivals before they started off on their campaigns (y atra). 40 However, as we shall see below, the royal aspect greatly diminished in the medieval rite of the east that was to succeed the one in Vidyãpati. In later sources such as in the DPT, and indeed in all the Gauda manuals, harvest rites and motifs such as the bilva and the navapatrikã overshadow war rituals, suggesting that the community in which the worship was offered was agricultural, and concerns over fertility were paramount. Indeed in 1959 D.P. Chattopadhyaya pointed out the agricultural basis of the Bengali rite, finding allusions to female genitalia and pregnancy in the lotus motif of the sarvatobhadramandala and the anthropomorphic figure painted on the pümaghata used during the rite, and, though his final comment that the püjä "is just agricultural magic" is rather reductive, he does indeed mark a particular trend which I examine further below.41 The agricultural augmentations to the Durgä Püjä may be connected to the fact that, in Bengal, the goddess and her various forms were historically sacred to particular villages as grãmadevts (village goddesses). The association between the goddess and the village community is still in evidence in many pïthas (sacred sites associated with the goddess) in the district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where, as the Šaiva legend holds, Satis body parts fell. The community surrounding the pxtha honours the goddess with annual performances of the Durgä Püjä and her presence is held accountable for a good harvest and the sustenance of the whole village.42 An investigation of her Purãnic myths reveals that the goddess's archaic virginal-martial character altered in the medieval period as she was syncretised with the fertility cults of mother goddesses ( mãtrs , mãtrka) popular at regional levels. As shown by Yokochi, to whose research our knowledge of the early history of the goddess is greatly indebted, the virgin- warrior "prototype" fully appears in the sixth-seventh century ce Skanda Purãna, Chapters 34, 53--69,43 in which the goddess's symbolism of motherhood and fertility is not understood to be a chief facet of her nature. It is rather her warrior properties that are central. But sometime in the eighth century ce, the virgin-warrior became cognate with PãrvatI, the archetypical consort and mother, and this assimilation is reflected in Bâna's Candïsataka , 102 verses in praise of the buffalo-slaying Purãnic goddess composed sometime in that period, which eulogises her frequently as Gaun. However this connection is made even more overt 40 Vidyãpati mentions that the military campaign begins after the püjä following the lustration of the troops and the consecration of metallic weapons ( lauhãbhikãrika yajña ): mrãjane turaňge krte lauhãbhikãrikeyajne abhisikte rãjãsve tato nrpãnãm bhaved yãtrã ' [Durgãbhaktitaraúgim, p. 110]. D.P. Chattopadhyaya 1959, pp. 294-296. For more on the pithas in Bengal, See Sircar, 1973. However his work is out of date. Nothing valuable on this subject has been written since that time. In Yokochi 2004, pp. I97-334- The edition of these chapters from the Skanda Purãna is based on the earliest part of the text contained in a Nepalese manuscript of 810 ce, along with its later rescensions the Revãkhanda and the Ambikãkhanda (Yokochi 2004, p. 200).</page><page sequence="15">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 339 in the later eastern Purãnas - where she is homologised with indigenous mother-goddesses - and where she is lavishly described and lauded, in no uncertain terms, as a fertility icon and an embodiment of sexual desire. For instance, in the Kãlikã , a Purãna promoting the shrine of Kãmãkhyã in Assam, the warrior Durgã is identified with the mother-goddess Kãmãkhyã (Sanskrit "She who is called Sexual Desire") who is held to energise the pttha in Kämarüpa (modern day Assam) where Satis reproductive organs are said to have fallen, and who grants sexual fulfillment. The relevant lines where this assimilation occurs are as follows: puspam ãropya kãmãkhyãm sãradãm ãhvayen muhuh ' ehy ehi paramesãni sãnnidhyam iha kalpaya || pãjãbhãgam grhãnemam makham raksa namo'stu te ' durge durge ihãgaccha sarvaih parikaraih saha || pújãbhãgam grhãnemam makham raksa namo'stu te | Kãlikã Purãna 65.3 0-3 2ab "Placing a flower, he must repeatedly summon Kãmãkhyã-Sãradã: "Arrive, arrive О Supreme Goddess, make your presence here. Accept this portion of the worship. Protect the sacrifice. Homage to you. O Durgã, Durgã, come here with all your attendants. Accept this portion of the worship. Protect the sacrifice. Homage to you". The next two verses instruct the worshipper to invoke Kãmãkhyã with the Durgã-Gãyatri mantra, further sealing the homology between the two deities in the course of worship.44 The melange between the two yields a paradox. Kãmãkhyã has a dual aspect, an erotic and a fierce one: when she wishes to make love she holds a garland; at other times she carries a sword, as indicated in the verse: khadgam tyaktvã kãmakãle sã grhnãti srajam svayam | yadã tu tyaktakãmã sã tadã syãd asidhãriní || Kãlikã Purãna 58. 57. Leaving her sword aside before making love, she takes a garland. When she has finished making love, she becomes [once again] a Sword-Bearer. As a martial embodiment, not only does Kãmãkhyã protect during the performance of an apotropaic rite (. sãntikam ), in prison ( kãrãgãre nibaddhó) or during raids by enemies ( paracakrãgame ) dressed in the trappings of a warrior deity, but, as an embodiment of sexual properties, she also enhances erotic pleasure during love-making. So the Kãlikã instructs that a man must always meditate on Candikã (here of course also implying Kãmãkhyã) before copulating with his wife. pativratãyãm bhãryãyãm sadaiva rtusamgamah | kriyate candikãm dhyãtvã tadã kãryo vihhütaye || Kãlikã Purãna 58.9 "Copulation at the fertile period must always be performed with a devoted wife having contemplated Candikã for the sake of prosperity". Hence Kãmãkhyã-Candikã is described as kãmadã (pleasure giving) or kãmesvan (goddess of pleasure) at the same time as she augments military prowess. For the worshipper, this 44narayanyai vidmahe tvam candikayai tu dhtmahi || sesabhãge tu gãyatryãs tan naš candí pracodayãt ' Kãlikã Purãna 65. 30-3 3a</page><page sequence="16">340 Bihani Sarkar paradox is believed to be a more potent manifestation of the "Great Goddess" and her ability to fluidly invest all forms, however opposed. Nevertheless, despite the growing eroticisation of Candika in the east, the old idea of her martial nature was still coveted. Thus writers of ritual works in medieval east India frequently referred to this association between Durgä and royal power in the ancient scriptures to advance the benefits of the Püjä to new clients who no doubt were eager to possess the glitter of royalty. Thus Sülapäni begins his treatise on the Durgä Püjä citing the Devi Purãna and the Bhavisya Purãna, in which rewards attractive for a man of power and prestige are emphasised: О King, when Durgã is pleased, the benefit in half the blinking of an eye Not even Siva is able to describe in a hundred years! and There is no famine nor sorrow in that land Nor does someone suffer an untimely death where Candika is worshipped The man who pleases the Goddess with this rite The Goddess nurtures as if he were Skanda in every misfortune. There is no limit to his sons, wives, wealth and prosperity. Having enjoyed supreme pleasures in this world he becomes the Goddess's attendant after dying.45 Sülapäni was singling out a specific sort of patron- one who like a king held a public function, owned land, was concerned with mundane goals, rather than liberation, and had wealth. It is evident from the DPT that the range of rites from the opening bodhana to the closing visarjana , the animals needed for bali and the rich offerings spread over a period of ten days would have amounted to a great expense. It was not a regular worship but a lavish one ( visesapüja ), as indeed it still remains to the present day. Given these conditions, which social category formed the principal clients of the püjä in medieval Bengal? The growing emphasis on the fecund property of the goddess in the culture of the times encouraged the rise of a new sort of patron in late medieval Bengal, one who, if not strictly a king, was desirous of the royal sheen and prestige associated in lore with Durgã- worship, while simultaneously, being closely tied to a rural setting, esteemed the earth and her yield. One indication of the slip in social patronage from king to commoner (or rather an aristocratic "commoner") is a gloss Jimütavähana makes on the phrase nrpatir api while 45 devïpurânam ' tustãyãm nrpa durgãyãm nimesãrdhena yat phalam ' na tad vaktum maheso'pi sakto varsasatair api || bhavisye na tatra dese durbhiksam na ca duhkham pravartate ' nãkãle mriyate kascit püjyate yatra candika || anena vidhinã yas tu devïm pñnayate narah ' skandavat pälayet tam tu devi sarvãpadi sthitam || putradãradhanarddhmãm samkhyã tasya na vidyate | bhuktveha paraman bhogãn pretya devïgano bhavet || [ Durgosavaviveka , pp. 1-2].</page><page sequence="17">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 341 citing a source on the nïrâjana - the ritual lustration of the king s army - in his chapter on the autumnal worship in the Kãlaviveka. The source discusses the benefits of the nïrâjana (and the auspicious sighting of a bird thereafter) during the Durgã Püjä with regard to a king ( nrpati ). The api used after the word nrpati in the source is obviously viewed as open to interpretation by Jlmütavähana. In his commentary Jlmütavähana writes: "By the word api even a non-king ( anrpatir apt) must be implied."46 Jlmütavähana s pushing the word to make nrpati also mean a commoner (anrpati) implies that a range of patrons existed for the Durgã Püjä who were not strictly kings. Raghunandana does not mention who his patrons were. Nevertheless it is possible to unravel the social position of the intended patron via clues provided in the DPT. The first set appears in the samkalpa, the Formal Declaration of Intent. The samkalpa is taken before the initiation of any component rite of the worship. During its taking, the patron defines himself through epithets conveying what he seeks to achieve through the ritual while swearing an oath to fulfil his ritual obligations to their completion. From these epithets, the goals and status of the patron for whom the work was written can be inferred. The epithets used for the patron throughout the course of worship are as follows: 4 šrxamukadevašarmari , ' atulavibhütikämah ' (2), 4 samvatsarasukhakãmah ' (2), ' srídurgãprãptikãmah' / 'mdurgãprítikãmah ' (4) , 'sarvabãdhãnirmuktatvadhanadhãnyasutãnvitatvakãmah ' , 'sarvakãmasiddhi kãmah', '[višistaphaloddeše] dhanakãmah, putrakãmah', ' skandavatpãlanãsamkhyãtaputradãrãdh anardhimadaihikaparamabhogalãbhapwvakãmutradevabhavana-kãmah ', ' mahãbalabhavanakãmah 'dasavarsãnavachinnasrídurgãprítikãmah'.47 There are two variations given in case the patron requires specific benefits (višistaphaloddeše) such as wealth ( dhanakãmah ) and sons (putrakãmah). He mainly desires the following: (i) either incomparable wealth (atulavibhütikämah) or (in case he chooses not to select this phrase) happiness for the new year (samvatsarasukhakãmah) or simply to either please or be united with Durgã (srïdurgâprïtikâmah/srïdurgâprâptikâmah) ; (ii) freedom from all obstacles (sarvabãdhanirmuktatva) and being endowed with (-anvita) wealth (1 dhana ), crops (dhãnya) and sons (suta); (iii) to accomplish all desires (sarvakãmasiddhikãmah); (iv) [to be] nurtured like Skanda [by the Goddess] (skandavatpãlana-) , [to have] countless sons, wives, wealth and prosperity (asamkhyãtaputradãrãdhanarddhi-) along with (-mad-) supreme bliss in this world (aihaikaparamabhogalãbha-) followed by heaven in the next world ( pürvakämutradevabhavana ); (v) to become extremely powerful (mahãbalabhavanakãmah); (vi) Durgã s affection for ten years (dafavarsãnavachinnasrídurgãprítikãmah). Lastly his name is given as being (such-and-such-a) Devašarman. Of these (ii) and (iv) overlap - the desire to beget sons and secure wealth being the most common concern. From the beginning of the püjä to the very end, what characterises the ritualised goals of the patron is desire for the enhancement of land, sons, wealth and power.

No supernatural powers are demanded, thus distinguishing the püjä in this respect from a rite for magical siddhis. The fundamental aim of the ritual, as indicated in the samkalpa , is to please Durgä for material needs. We thus find the archaic terminology suggestive of royalty and monarchical aspirations still deeply embedded within a relatively new ritual structure that, on the whole, privileged symbols of fecundity and the earth. A striking feature of the patron is that he is not a warrior ( ksatriya ) by caste, while conventionally the ksatriya caste is usually associated with the demand for warrior-centric rites such as the nïrâjana. This is indicated by the patron being called Devašarman - a Brahmin name - which means that Raghunandana s text was primarily intended for a rich brahmin, a lay worshipper rather than an ascetic or a devoted initiated practitioner. In all probability he was an independent feudal lord, such was common in Bengal at the time, who owned land, ran a household, saw himself and his lineage as being responsible for the welfare and protection of those working on his estate. He would sponsor the Durgä Püjä to celebrate the goddess to safeguard his possessions, gain a good harvest and show his rivals that he was a person of standing, rather than to secure military success and ward off danger, which were largely secondary benefits. Evidence of Brahmin landlords who celebrated the Durgä Püjä is scarce, but some sources attribute the performance of the first rite to a local king and bhuiyãn , the Rãjã Kamsanãrãyana of Tãhirapura in Varendra, a Brahmin of the Rãya lineage, sometime in 1 5 83. 48 Kamsanãrãyana was famous for assisting Todar Mai and Munim Khan, Akbar's deputies, in dislodging the Afghan Daud Karrani from power and consolidating Mughal rule in Bengal. After being thwarted by the Akbari government in furthering his political ambitions, Kamsanãrãyana returned to Tãhirapura, having refused the post of the Diwan (finance minister) in the Mughal government in Bengal. Back in his private estate, his ambitions nipped in the bud, he experienced an urge to become a rule-abiding and dharmic leader. He asked his priest to suggest the names of religious sacrifices he could sponsor in order to regain his fading power. Eliminating the räjasüya and asvamedha , the priests selected the Durgä Püjä. Kamsanãrãyana commissioned his chaplain ( rãjapurohita ) the Tantric Rameša Sarman to compose a treatise on the autumnal Durgä Püjä, and performed a püjä so grand it aroused the jealousy of his rivals. They were quick to follow suit. Other sources attribute importance to the zamindãr Laksmï Kãnta, a Brahmin of the Sãvarni lineage, and the Rãjã Vasanta Rãya of Raigarh as the joint-promulgators of the first autumnal rite in Bengal in the year 1 585. 49 The success of this rite, which was public and attended by many people, meant that it soon attracted other patrons among the landlord class. Whatever the truth of these claims, they nevertheless point to the fact that the Mughal invasion marked a watershed in history for the Bengali autumnal rite, along with the growing assertion and confidence of the zamindãri class. Landlords in the mould of Kamsanãrãyana, Laksmï Kãnta and Vasanta Rãya possibly exemplify the kind of patrons Raghunandana s püjä may have attracted; and the spread of the Durgã-rite, suggestive as it was of traditional regality, was inextricably linked to their demonstration and ritual constitution of political splendour and might. 48M.

In the third book, Bhäratacandra describes the fortunes of a local chieftain, Bhavãnanda Majumdãr of Baguyan - 'nam, khub husiyãr bãúgãlí bãmon' (a Bengali Brahmin of great valour) who is said to have begun the worship of the goddess after his campaign against the Muslims. The story therefore adapts as its central motif an old Säkta theme of goddess worship by kings before and during battles whose pedigree stretches back to such ancient sources as the seventh-century Prakrit Gaudavaho ofBappal and modifies it to suit the temper of the times. In contrast to her martial character in early literature, the goddess in the Annadämangal, like the Assamese Kãmãkhyã-Candikã, is perceived as the fecund force of the cosmos, associated with new life and food. She is also depicted as the saviour of the pious Brahmin against the Muslims. However, here the character of the deity is different from the early sources in which the theme of worshipping the goddess before battles is presented- the goddess of Bhavãnanda s Durgã Püjä, like the Assamese Kãmãkhyã-Candikã, is conceived as having mainly fecund, nurturing qualities. The book, opening with the Mughal deputy Mãnsimha s arrival in Bengal to fight King Pratãpãditya of Vardhamãna, narrates that the Rajput enlisted the support of Bhavãnanda in his war. Bhavãnanda was a fervent devotee of Annapürnä, an agricultural form of the Purãnic Durgã held in high regard in Bengal as the giver of crops and nourishment to the human world. But in a testament to the Bengali trend of assimilating fertility goddesses with Durgã, prevalent, as we have seen, even in Assam, Annapürnä is also described in verses of homage as a warrior goddess herself, capable of great massacre and victory in war. For instance in the Purãnic MahisamardinI, she is called the slayer of Mahisa and asked to grant prosperity to the king and good fortune to the kingdom ( rãjãr mangal kara rãjyer kusal ), thus indicating her close ties with kingship, or in this case feudal lordship. Evoking her name which means "She who makes replete with victuals", the poem emphasises her power to nourish through crops and food. In order to rouse the Rajput Kings awareness of her mahimã (power), Annapürnä created a great storm that destroyed his provisions, livestock, animals and troops. Through her grace and nutritive powers, Bhavãnanda provided Mãnsimha with an abundant supply of food and grain for a week, and thus kept him and his troops alive. On Mãnsimha enquiring about the cause of this apparent magic, Bhavãnanda revealed the presence of the goddess in his life and described her ritual procedure to him. Thus enlightened by his ally, Mãnsimha worshipped Annapürnä and, pleased by his devotion, she ended the storm. Thereafter, Mãnsimha conquered Pratãpãditya of Vardhamãna in a formidable battle, and attributed his success to Annapürnä s nurturing of Bhavãnanda. In gratitude he asked Bhavãnanda to accompany him to the Delhi durbar and promised a kingdom and riches from the emperor. Before they embarked on their victorious procession northwards, Bhavãnanda worshipped Annapürnä in order to secure her blessings before the campaign (yãtra). On his arrival in Delhi, Mãnsimha praised Bhavãnanda s conduct and Annapürnä's majesty to Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, and requested him to reward the Brahmin with a kingdom. However Jahangir spurned his request, casting scorn on Annapürnä as a satanic demoness and clapping Bhavãnanda behind bars. In prison, Bhavãnanda sang a hymn to Annapürnä in despair. She travelled to Delhi with her companions Jayã and Vijayã, granted him abhaya (fearlessness) and in her wrath, switching into her wild aspect, commanded her hordes of</page><page sequence="20">344 Bihani Sarkar yoginl s, dãkinl s, bhütas, guhyakas and bhairavas to lay seige to Delhi in scenes highly evocative of Durgã and her fury in such Sanskrit sources as the Kathãsaritsãgara 15 л and the battle scenes of the Purãnas. But in the case of the Annadãmaúgala the poet replaces Purãnic demons with the Muslims, and the ghost hordes of myth invade the homes of Mughal Delhi instead of the battlefields of heaven, gleefully terrorising the women of the zenana in a pastiche of their onslaught on the gods. Then Annapürnä proceeded to rob the city of all its provisions. Note again how it is the ability to nurture and provide victuals that is emphasised as the goddess's ultimate power over the cosmos. Punishment is conceptualised as the threat of the goddess to cut all nutritive cords and it is only by this threat of starvation that the emperor is brought to his senses. He then begged Bhavânanda s pardon. In the prison the goddess manifested, in divine visions, her mayaprapañca, her paradoxical abilities to pervade and sustain the world in a bewildering array of ultimately delusory forms. The emperor was surrounded on all sides by scenes of the goddess's legend from the Devímãhãtmya , where again Annapürnä's identity merges with the Purãnic warrior Durgã. In some places he witnessed her slaying of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, the buffalo demon Mahisa; in others he saw the messenger's account of the goddess to Sumbha-Nisumbha, the slaying of the demon Dhümralocana, the deaths of Raktablja, Canda and Munda by Cãmundã, Sumbha and Nisumbha's deaths, the appearance of the goddess before the merchant Samãdhi and the king Suratha, the central human characters in the Devímãhãtmya myth and so on. Astonished and overcome, he wished to worship the goddess and encouraged the rest of the Muslim populace to become Sãktas. What follows now appears conventional in a goddess story: pleased by the Mughal king's worship, her anger abated and Annapürnä granted him her vision. On his triumphant return from Delhi to his estate, Bhavânanda with a great fanfare began an annual Spring worship to Annapürnä in Caitra.50 This is also described by the smãrtas as Durgã 's Vernal Rite, the Vasantlpüjä.51 The Annadãmaúgala illuminates a particular moment in Bengali devotional history, marking, perhaps for the first time, in sophisticated, bold and witty verse, the rise of the cult of the agricultural Durgã in the domain of the aristocratic feudal home, whose presence pervades the medieval Bengali Durgã Püjä. Durgã in various local manifestations symbolic of the nurturing "mother", rather than the "Demon-Slayer" (though this still remained a shadowy trace in the background), was worshipped during the medieval period in Bengal - both through the autumnal and the spring rites by zamindãrs of influence who regarded her as the reason for their success. For just as Annadã was a cornucopia of food, so was she believed to overflow with glory, gifts and wealth. As demonstrated in both the Annadãmaúgala and in the case of Kamsanãrãyana, these zamindãrs were mainly small but proud chieftains whose political fortunes were on the rise. Their impact on the genesis of an urban Bengali culture and lifestyle was significant: they were sophisticated and erudite patrons of the arts, setting standards in their domains that were to be copied all over Bengal in other well-to-do homes, often well versed in Sanskrit, Bengali and Persian. In their spiritual lives some (such as the zamindãr Cakradhara Bhuyãn, 50Sülapäni, Vasantîviveka; Vacaspatï Mišra, Vasantïpûjaprakarana from the Krtyacintãmani.

In fact, the rise of the cult of the agricultural Durgã among the aristocracy of Bengal was tied up with the reinvigoration of Bengali Brahmin identity that sought to preserve its religious purity against the dominance of the Muslims. The Sãkta zamindãrs believed that in all actions in life they were favoured by this goddess's grace, a belief that encouraged their independence and feats of heroism. For what set Durgã apart from a salvific male god who could grant power but ultimately remained at an impersonal distance from mortals was the view in the literature and culture of the age that her relationship with select worshippers was private, intense and palpable, marked by fits, trances, possession. She appears to the elect in dream visions (as in the Kathãsaritsãgara 7.3 or 7.8.57-59) or in person (as in Bhavânanda s tale) or in the form of a young girl (such as the boatmen's encounter with the runaway bride in the poem Isvarï Pãtnl from the Annadâmaûgaî) when exhorted. These appearances, highly charged and visceral, are rare and consequently greatly valued by the worshipper. In literature we find that those to whom she appears profit immeasurably in the fruition of their ambitions. She appears to them not once but many times in their lives, during moments of crisis or change, such as when Bhavânanda is imprisoned in Delhi or when he returns home to Bengal, a successful man after his travels. And the goddess herself profits in equal measure, being vaunted, feted and paid lavish tribute by her grateful votary. To ensure the continuance of this mutually profitable relationship, the compact between chieftain and goddess is carefully maintained in his family, generation after generation, biannually celebrated during the beginning of the harvest in Spring and the military year in Autumn. Let us now consider the particulars of the feudal püjä. One thing is clear about the worship prescribed in the DPT: it was not a court rite. Earlier püjäs of Durgã tended mainly to be court events that secured the interests of the entire kingdom. The DurgãbhaktitaranginT is one of the earliest medieval east Indian sources for the court rite. The püjä in that work was obviously envisaged on a much grander scale than Raghunandana's. Lists of offerings to the goddess include many kinds of cloth, ornaments such as jewels, crowns, gold vessels, parasols with gold and copper handles, chowries with gold and jewelled handles, appointed beds, canopies, horses, cows, white buffaloes, slave girls, three kinds of crested banners, land grants, crops and so forth gifts that only a well-endowed and opulent court could muster.53 Raghunandana's text in contrast gives a comparatively restrained inventory, followed usually by the option yathãsakti/yathãlãbham (according to one's means; as he is able to procure) indicating a more modest backdrop for the ritual and that the performer was not as wealthy as a king. Furthermore, had his patrons been kings, Raghunandana would surely have included a dedicatory verse, standard in most texts commissioned by royalty. A key ritual of kingship during the Durgã Püjä was the lustration of the king's army (nïrâjana). Towards the end of the goddess's festival, a monarch would lustrate his army and his possessions before setting off on his campaign. Many Purãnas discuss the nïrâjana of a 52 In 1604 Cakradhara built a temple to the goddess Sarvamañgalá in Medinipur, Bengal who reportedly commanded him to do so. The accompanying inscription says that the shrine was completed "in obedience to the command of Sn Mangalã ThãkurãnT", A.K. Bhattacharya 1982, p. 61. Durgabhaktitaraňgini, pp. 170-186.</page><page sequence="22">346 Bihani Sarkar kings army during the Durgã Püjä in some detail. A myth from the Kãlikã Purãna says that Indra performed the nïrâjana after Durgä's battle with Mahisa to ward off evil and to bring prosperity to the army of the gods and the kingdom of heaven.54 So Jlmütavähana underlines the necessity of the lustration for kings during the goddess's festival by citing the passage: On the Twelfth, Eighth or Fifteenth of the bright half of Kãrttika Conjoined with Asva a king must perform the apotropaic [rite] known as the Nïrâjana. When the nïrâjana is completed, in that direction where he sees A wagtail depart, the king having gone acquires immediate power over enemies.55 The nïrâjana followed by the kings yãtrã (military campaign) is commonplace in most of the smãrta paddhath. Vidyãpati, for instance, devotes a substantial portion of his work to this, citing as one of his authorities Bhojarãja, King of Dhära. A royal gateway ( torana ) measuring ten cubits ( dasahastam ucchritam) in length and eight cubits in width ( vistare' stau ) is to be erected facing the east (prãúmukham) , decorated with crested banners and garlands (dhvajamâlâvibhUsitam) and well protected with medicinal herbs (suraksitam causadhibhih) . After being bathed and purified, the kings horses are led by armoured soldiers (samnãhikapurahsarãh) with the chanting of hymns ( brahmaghosaih ) and musical accompaniment (gïtavâditranihsvanaih) eulogised by bards, panegyrists and musicians (sütamägadhagandharvaih stüyamänas) and protected by weapon-bearing soldiers and grooms (sastrahastais ca purusais tathaivâsvopajïvibhih . . . raksyamãnâs) to the gateway. The officiant lights a fire near the southern pillar and, having offered an oblation in the fire, he blesses the king. In the north and south of the gate stand eight able-bodied men ( astau manusyâ avyaúgâ ulkãhastãdvidhâ sthitãh) bearing blazing torches in each hand in order to protect the horses from fire-fearing raksasas. The fire is passed around from torch to torch. The horses are sprinkled with the remaining oblation or offered ' pindas ' (rice balls) with an invocation. The oblation is fed to the horses and they are consecrated with verses recited into their right ear. They are then sprinkled with water from kusa grass and led by the king and his ministers through the gateway with cries of "Jaya* (Victory). It is quite apparent that the nïrâjana was envisaged as a state rite that would protect the army and ensure its success in forthcoming campaigns.56 However, in the case of the DPT the nïrâjana is no longer performed on an army and there is no mention of the king's yâtrâ following it. The nïrâjana is now performed only for the goddess's image. Metaphors of kingship are retained in the worship, such as the ringing of the bell which is described as the "sound of victory", the chowrie (câmara), the parasol ( chatra ), the crested banner ( dhvaja ) - the three emblems of sovereignty, the worship of weapons (astrapüjä/sastrapüjä) and the obligatory animal sacrifice whereby the patron would become a mahâbala , kinglike in his powers. But in the absence of an army, these have now become domesticated rites of state power that are merely symbolic in their function. 54sakro'pi devasenaya nirajanam athakarot | sãntyartham surasainyãnãm devarãjyasya vrddhaye || [Kãlikã Purãna 60.33] dvãdasyãm astamyãm kãrttikasuklasya pancadasamyãm vã ' ãsvayuje vã kuryãn nírãjanasamjmtãm sãntim || nírãjane nivrtte yayã disã khañjanam nrpo yãntam | pasyet tayãgatasya ksipram arãtir vasam upaiti || [Durgotsavaviveka, p. 36] Durgabhaktitaraúgini , p. 125.</page><page sequence="23">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 347 A further rite performed in the court püjä was the ritual entrance of the horses in the kings stable. Its importance lay in empowering warhorses for battle. It was performed on the bright second lunar day of the worship and continued up to the ninth. In the Durgabhaktitaranginï the rite is perfomed to the deities Revanta and Uccaihšravas to ward off malignant forces from the horses.57 In the DPT this rite is not taught at all. Clearly the patron of the DPT did not require such an obviously military component of the worship and, indeed, all martial rites are supplanted by agricultural rites from the first phase of the püjä up to the night of the seventh (Saptamï) lunar day. The warrior rites are now concentrated in the antepenultimate and penultimate days [see Table of the Main Rites], a move that, I strongly suspect, reveals they may be completely phased out in due course from the ritual sequence. The structure of the püjä had changed in the DPT so that a clear division between the two sets of agricultural and warrior rites became discernible. In the court rite of Vidyãpati this division was not maintained and warrior rites frequently overlapped with agricultural rites. This harvest-warrior schism in the ritual structure appeared in the Bengali rite even before Raghunandana, in the works Jlmütavähana, Sülapäni and Snnãtha and he thus represents a mature phase of this development. All these factors indicate that the püjä was being performed in the domain of private Bengali households rather than in the royal courts.58 It had thus adapted from being a rite of state empowerment to a rite that empowered a wealthy household. Hence rites that prepared the state for armed conflict are either completely eschewed or kept only in name, while rites that brought a good harvest or added the qualities of kingship to the patron and his household are maintained. This transition was no doubt encouraged by a particular phenomenon in Bengali history when, as previously noted, there was an upsurge of local landlords. They maintained lavish homes in lieu of courts, so complex in organisation that they formed small kingdoms unto themselves. Bhavânanda s administration, for instance, is vividly described by Bhäratacandra in the following way: An oveijoyed Bhavãnanda Majumdãr, having bathed and worshipped his deity, stepped out of the inner quarters of his house. The clock-man made the clock ring out the hour and the baton-man stood in front with his stick. The kings secretary who looks after the collection of taxes ( dewãn ), the officer for the measurement of land (âmïn), the official who drafts letters on behalf of the king (bakst), the officials who take care of papers and files (munshï, daptarî) and the treasurer (khãjãnct) were all duly appointed after great deliberation. The draftsman and the assistant started doing the accounts. The representative of the king ( nãyeb ) wrote out the edict (farmãn) in accordance with his command and despatched it to the suburban areas ( maphasval ). All the subdivisions (parganã) were brought under his rule. All subjects, village headsmen and revenue collectors came to see the new ruler. They brought gifts of different kinds (siropa) and also monetary offerings (selãmt) which were four times the gifts that were offered. In this way, gradually, all formalities of a royal state ( rãjatva ) were started and maintained. (Bhavãnanda) coming to know that the month of Agrahãyana (now considered the eighth month of the Bengali year) is the beginning of the year, decided that the collection of revenue should start on the auspicious day. Having joyfully passed 57 Durgabhaktitaranginï, pp. 111-116. b8From the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, the majority of Durgä Püjäs held in Bengal were conducted in such households.</page><page sequence="24">348 Bihani Sarkar the months of Pausa, Mãgha and Phãlguna, (Bhavãnanda) started worshipping Goddess Annadã in the month of Caitra.59 Households modelled on royal courts such as this were the likely settings for goddess worship throughout Bengal. Zamindãrs like Bhavãnanda emulated the mannerisms and customs of larger kings, describing their domains as "rãjatvas" (kingdom), using the administrative divisions and titles of the more powerful Islamic court such as dewans, munshis, nayabs and so forth and including in their life-style the use of rituals conventionally associated with Hindu kingship, although they would not have necessarily initiated military campaigns. This was because zamindãrs were primarily keepers of land and not soldiers. Nevertheless they were eager to sponsor the worship of the goddess for prestige and sanctification, and also to assert their religious identity against the Islamic government that held power. Be it in the court or in the large household, the fundamental context for the rite remained the same. The worship ofDurgä was attached to bastions of privilege and power. What is significant in this movement from court to household is that the rite diffused from centres of state power to localised levels of power represented by the landed gentry. In tandem with this development, the martial character of the deity, once sacred to the old warrior races that ran kingdoms and waged wars, also diminished as she came increasingly to be viewed as a pacific deity with power over the harvest on which the Bengali feudal household depended. With the demise of monarchies and fiefdoms, rituals associated with the empowerment of state and household naturally grew redundant. Thus in the modern püjä, the role of the zamindãri patron, his family and the feudal home has been taken over by the civic community. The majority of modern Bengali Durgä Püjäs are collective and funded by urban organisations through subscriptions. 59 Translation by Paulami Sengupta kindly given to me in a personal communication and not previously published.

An Overview of the Ritual Procedure of the DurgãpUjãtattva : All forms of Candl-worship were construed by mainstream Brahminical religion as antinomian to some degree: bloodshed in the presence of the deity during the animal sacrifice, the visible offering of the blood and Tantric worship, essential to goddess worship at least in Bengal, were viewed with suspicion by most Vaidikas, on account of their inherent impurity.60 This may explain why, for instance, they do not appear in the Navarãtra rites in more orthodox regions such as Tanjore. Their performance in the open during the public rites of the Durgä Püjä - an event attended by large numbers of people - required additional support. The challenge for Raghunandana, a strict orthodox Brahmin, would have been to prepare a form of worship that occupied the middle ground - one that worshipped the goddess properly, that is to say with blood and Tantric rituals - while at the same time not being seen to cause impurity in the eyes of brahminical orthodoxy. Therefore the rites in the DPT are a blend of Tantricised and orthodox Brahminical elements. While the orthodox elements gave the rites the legitimate basis sought after by the feudal lord, the Tantric rites would have made the power-bestowing element of the püjä more effective, and would have been seen to propitiate the wrathful nature of the goddess. Immediately recognisable Tantricised rites in the DPT are the bhütasuddhi (purification of gross matter), nyãsa (installation of mantras on the body) and the worship of the Mother goddesses ( mãtrs ). Contemplative Tantric rites of visualisation and self-identification with the deity are also common features of the worship Raghunandana advocates. Indeed a striking feature of the DPT is the strong emphasis laid on Tantric meditation, unaccounted, to my knowledge, in any of the other smãrta works. Animal sacrifice is elaborately described, indicating that though orthodox, Raghunandana was certainly not squeamish in this matter. However, every rite in the DPT operates within the framework of Brahminical purity ( sanca ) - offerings of the cleansing ãcamana (sipping) water are made to the goddess at all times; a verse is recited during the animal sacrifice that justifies "the killing as not a killing" ( yajñe vadho'vadhah) thereby incurring no sin; an option to replace animal sacrifice by vegetable offerings is included; and though flesh is acceptable, alcohol is not. Like all the smãrtas , Raghunandana held that the rite was both nitya (obligatory) and kãmya (optional): that is, it was to be performed calendrically as a matter of rule, and at the same time because it fulfilled a specific need ( kãma ).6Í It should be noted that the smãrtas were the first to 60 "In the Vedic animal sacrifice, the sacrificial animal is slain by suffocation. No blood is allowed to be spilt (Schwab 1886, pp. 88-107; Minkowski 1991, pp. 39-64)." During the Vedic pasubandha, the animal is tied to a post in front of the ãhãvamya fire, and consecrated in various ways, especially with apotropaic verses from the Rgveda and a firebrand lit from the ãhãvamya pit. It is led away, to a spot called the sãmitr, a on the boundary of the enclosure (note the separation of ritual slaughter from the locus of ritual sacrifice) and suffocated. Once dead, the animal is cut open and the relevant pieces removed. While the animal is being stifled, the sacrificer and the priests, apart from those directly involved, turn their back. This action strikes me as a gesture indicative of the shame caused by the associated impurity attached to the killing. See Minkowski 1991, p. 40, where he notes "the Maitravaruna's duties are very closely tied to containment, as it were, of the inauspiciousness inherent in the animals death". By turning their backs the "Rgveda priests are ritually dissociated from the moment of the animals death" (p. 51). I am grateful to Professor Minkowski for indicating the passages in Schwab. 6 athãsvinadurgãpãjã nityã kãmyã ca | [DPT, Prayoga].

The performance of the rituals is guided by the orthodox prescription that an appropriate time is required for the rite to be fruitful.62 Unless the moment is propitious, the rite will yield no benefit for the patron. Thus each rite during the autumnal festival takes place at a certain time (astronomically determined) on a certain tithi, a lunar day, in the month of Ãsvina. Conventionally, the Durgä Püjä rites in Äsvina span ten lunar days, with most of the major rituals taking place in the bright phase, as Durgã is closely associated with light (tejas) in the Purãnas. During these days, the goddess is considered to manifest herself on earth to slay evildoers and provide blessings and prosperity to all deserving humankind. The time of the Durgä Püjä is calculated according to the Brahminical lunar calendar which is divided, according to the phases (paksas) of the moon, into a bright (sukla/sita) phase and a dark ( krsna / asita) phase. Each phase consists of fifteen tithis. According to this lunar calendar, Raghunandana stipulates seven ritual sequences ( kalpas ) determining the start of the püjä: i) navamyãdikalpah 63 : beginning on the dark ninth ( navami) of Ãsvina continuing till the tenth ( dasamt) in the bright phase of Äsvina, in the event that the lunar month is calculated from a New Moon64; ii) pratipadãdikalpah65 : beginning on the bright first (pratipat ) lasting until the bright DasamI in the event that the calendar is counted from the full moon (as is presently the custom in Bengal) iii) sasthyãdikalpah66 : beginning from the Bright Sixth ( sasthï ) till DasamI iv) saptamyãdikalpah67 : beginning on the bright 62nimittam kalam asritya vrttir vidhi-nisedhayoh ' iti Vrddhagargyavacane kalasya nimittatvapratiteh atrapi šaratkale iti nimittatvena sruteh saratkãlíneti durçãpiijãyã visesanatvenollikhyate I [DPT, Pramãna] 63 DPT, pp. 47-49- In the Pramãna Raghunandana says while glossing a verse from the Devi Puräna, teaching the initiation of the Navarãtra from the Dark Ninth of Äsvina till the Bright Sixth: tatra devTpurãnam - "ise mãsy asite pakse kanyãrãsigate ravau | navamyãm bodhayed devïm krtdãkautukamaúgalaih || jyesthãnaksatrayuktãyãm sasthyãm bilvãbhimantranam | " tatrãsvinamãsíyãyãm krsnanavamyãm bodhanam uktvã tadíyãsu suklasasthyãditithisu krtyãbhidhãnãd ãsvinasya krsnãditvam pratïyate On this subject the Devlpuräna says, "In the dark quarter of Isa (ãsvina), when the sun is in Virgo, one should awaken the goddess on the ninth with games, marvellous spectacles and benedictory verses. The Invitation (abhimantrana) of the goddess is on the sixth conjoined with the constellation Jyesthã. Here, since, having said that the awakening is on the dark navami in the month of Ãsvina, [the verse] declares that the rites are [to continue] up to the sixth bright lunar day of that very month, it is understood that Ãsvina begins with a dark quarter. This suggests that the Devi puräna passage followed a Purnimãnta (beginning with a new moon, ending in a full moon) calendrical system for the Navarãtra, while the post-Sena calendar in Bengal, converting to the Amanta system (beginning with a Full Moon, ending with a New Moon), obviously necessitated changes in the initiation tithi of the Bengali Durgã-rite. The present rite in Bengal interprets the kalpa beginning on Navami to mean the dark ninth of Bhãdra, the month prior to Ãsvina, a development first mentioned by Jlmütavähana in the Kãlaviveka (Durgäpüjäviveka, p. 30). It is possible that this change developed with the switch to the Amanta calendrical system under the Senas. Raghunandana obviously recollected the pre-Sena system referred to in the Devi Puräna and it could have been the case that there were still parts in the east where this system continued to be followed at the time. 65DPT, pp. 49.

The traditional customs of the household of the patron dictate which sequence will be followed. This seven-fold kalpa division is still maintained in the present Bengali rite.70 The earliest reference to this system is to be found in Sülapäni.71 A hundred (satãvrtti) or fifteen (pancãdasa ) recitations from the Purãnic DevTmãhãtmya , the principle scripture of the brahminical worshippers of the goddess, must be performed until Mahânavamî, a feature introduced for the first time in the DPT for it does not appear in the older Gaudlya treatises. In this scripture, the goddess's triumph over various Asuras, notably the buffalo demon Mahisa, and her restitution of universal order are celebrated in three histories ( carita ) of her deeds.72 This recitation, a eulogy and evocation of the Supreme Goddess's actions as the sole substrate pervading the cosmos, forms the hymnal backdrop to the worship of the goddess and continues to form an important part of the present rite. During the worship, the goddess undergoes stages of transformation ultimately maturing into the omnipotent "goddess". In the first stage, after the officiant rids th e püjä space of obstacle causers, she is ritually installed and worshipped in a tree and in a womb-shaped receptacle ( ghata )73 which strongly evoke allusions to the earth and reproduction. In addition to the goddess, the nine planets, the Sun, Ganesa, Siva and Visnu are worshipped in the water of the ghata with flowers, perfume, lights and incense offerings. Then a chalice with the arghya water is ritually installed, its waters are induced to turn to divine nectar through the officiant s enactment of the dhenu müdrä and the water is offered to a bilva tree along with the five-fold offerings (pañcopacara) , flowers or incense. The officiant then repeats the process of filling the arghya chalice with water (with unhusked barley, flowers, etc.) and turning it into nectar, repeats the mantra JayantI etc. eight times, he sprinkles himself and th e püjä implements with the nectarised water, he contemplates himself as the deity, places a flower on his head with the dhyãna verses (described below), meditatively worships himself as Durgã with mental offerings (mãnasopacãraih) , and summons the deity to be present in the bilva tree.

During this period between Pratipat and PañcamI (the first and the fifth lunar days), decorative gifts one would give a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, mainly cosmetics, accessories such as a string and a comb for tying the hair (a gesture marking a girls coming of age), red-lac, unguents and jewellery are made to the deity's youthful presence in the ghata and the bilva tree, suggesting, it would seem, her seductive and erotic potential. In the evening of the Sixth (or alternatively at dawn on the dark Ninth)74 she is awoken in the bilva tree, with mantra recitations said to be from the Liňga Purãna,75 in a rite called the Bodhana.76 The bel tree, which is sacred as it is described as the being of Durgã (pñjyo [ . . . ] durgãsvampatah) is ritually invited to the site of worship. Then, a branch from the sacred tree is cut off and installed in the püjä room with the appropriate mantras. On the Seventh, the goddess transforms from the ghata and the bilva tree spirit into her embodied form (mürti) by being installed (pratisthita) in a clay image. The officiant infuses the image with life in a rite known as the Conferral of Breath" (prãnapratistha) . From the verses of visualisation ( dhyãna ) said to be from the Matsya Purãna, it is evident that the clay image was that of the Purãnic ten-armed buffalo-slaying form of the goddess, the most commonplace iconographie depiction of Durgã in the medieval period. She is now worshipped as a magnificent royal figure who 74 The timing of this ritual seems to have been an extremely important topic for the practitioners, and the nibandhakãras (digest writers) are careful to note the tithi and the part of the day appropriate for the rite as the scriptures characteristically give conflicting information. The general consensus is that the Bodhana is either on the dark navami at dawn, or on the bright SasthT in the evening. Sülapäni favours the ninth as the first choice with the sixth as the second - "navamyãm bodhanãsamarthye sasthyãm bodhanam ". The conjunctions of the constellations Ãrdrã with Navami and Jyesthã with Sasthï are deemed highly auspicious by the nibandhakãras. A difference of opinion appears to have existed between the smãrtas and the Vaisnavas. In contrast to Raghunandana who prescribes the Bodhana either on the dark navami or on the bright sixth and keeps the conjunction with Ãrdrã (in the case of navami) and Jyesthã (in the case of SasthT) optional, the Kãlivilãsa Tantra, a later east Indian Sãkta text with strong Vaisnava overtones takes it as compulsory that the Bodhana should take place on the dark navami conjoined with Ãrdrã: yã nityã navami krsnã brahmavisnusivãrcitã ' ãrdrã laksmir iti khyãtã nityã srivisnuvallabhã ' ãrdrã rksena samyuktã yad dine navami bhavet || tad dine bodhanam putra prasastam kalisammatam ' navami sahitã cãrdrã yadi syãt rãtriyogatah ' prãtahkãle samiddhãyãm bodhanam tatra bhairava ' sribhairava uvãca | ãrdraksam yah parityajya navamyãm bodhanañ caret ' sa mi kamalãdevyã bhütvä yãti paratra ca || ãrdraksam yah parityajya durgãdevim prapüjayet ' viphalã tasya sãpUjã kadãcin na phalapradã || (30.73-12) The Kãlivilãsa Tantra also appears to favour the morning as the best time for the Bodhana. It is unclear to me why this Tantra is inflexible about this matter in contrast to the smãrta opinion, and can only suggest with reference to 7a and 8a that the dark ninth and Ãrdrã are of particular importance to Vaisnavas since Ãrdrã is homologised with Laksmï and navami with Nityã, the beloved ofVisnu (srivisnuvallabhã). Caturvargacintamani II i, pp. 906-907 Similar rituals may have been performed for tree-dwelling female spirits (yãksis) in early medieval India. In the Kathãsaritsãgara 5.3.204-215, a dvija named Devadatta worships a female spirit who dwelt in a tree at night with rice mixed with milk and balis made to the different directions for the accomplishment of siddhis. When the goddess is pleased, she appears from the tree and grants him boons.</page><page sequence="29">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 353 kills demons, invoked as "a summation of godly essences" since she is, according to myth, formed, as a proper ruler is, through the light of the gods. Through the litany of the dhyãna , the goddess is given shape and body, internally in the imagination of the worshipper. She is visualised as a beautiful and youthful woman, radiant with a moon diadem in her hair matted on her head, three-eyed, bejewelled and triumphant over the bloodied corpse of the buffalo demon. Having thus erected the form of the goddess in his heart and in the ritual space through the vivifying utterance of the mantra, the worshipper identifies his own nature with the deity, and places a flower on his head ( ätmapüja ), thereby becoming the Devi. Summoning the deity to infuse, not just himself but all parts of the püjä site, in the next stage the goddess is invited to enter the leaves of nine crops collectively called the "Navapatrikã". These are described as her dwelling place in the mortal world (tava martye saranam). The leaves are from rice, turmeric, Arum indicum ( mana ), barley, pomegranate, kacu , bel and the asoka , all important crops in Bengal. Nine forms of the goddess (unconnected to the Nine Durgãs worshipped later in the navadurgãpãja) are summoned and worshipped in each of the leaves. They are Brahmani (in the plantain), Raktadantikä (in the pomegranate, perhaps because of the analogy between the small red seeds of the fruit and the imagery of red fangs suggested by the name of this goddess, which means "She whose teeth are bloodied"), LaksmI (in the rice leaf), Durgã (in the turmeric leaf), Cãmundã (in the mãnaka ), Kãlikã (in the kacu), Sivã (in the bilva leaf), Sokarahitã (in the asoka leaf, probably on account of the analogy between their names, both of which mean "devoid of sorrow") and Kärttikl in the barley leaf. The nine leaves, the bel branch and the clay image are considered the receptacles of the goddess's energy during the remainder of the rite. Among these the first two form the specifically Bengali elements. With the goddess's entrance into the nine leaves the sacred triad is fully animated with the potency of the deity. She, who is thus "created composed of all the elements" (. sarvabhütamayodbhüta ), is believed now to fully inform (sthãpita) earth, leaf and tree, and thereby to make her presence (sãnnidhyam) close to the world of men. Thus end the rites of the Durgã Püjä that honour plants. The worship of plants in the first part of the medieval Püjä demonstrates a close relationship between the Bengali Durgã and the harvest. She is addressed as pallave samsthitã (figured in a leaf) in the litany. Her identity with the Srlphala (crab apple) and Sri, the goddess of bounty is heightened. These modes of address paying homage to the plant-dwelling Goddess ensured that she granted the seeker of power a rich yield from his land. It is important to note that out of the ten tithis, it is only in the last three that the goddess is embodied in conventional human imagery from the Purãnas. For the greater duration of the eastern Navarãtra she is symbolised through plants, the bilva and leaves from the nine crops, which are widely grown in the region. In this way the harvest rites of the Durgã Püjä in the DPT evoke the fecund aspect prominent, as we have seen, in the scriptures of the east, via her connection with the natural world. From the evening of the Seventh, after the first animal is sacrificed, the rites of power commence. From now on Durgã begins to transform from a pacific deity of the harvest to a deity of war and allusions to her violence and demon-slaying Purãnic role are made overt, particularly in the unveiling of the mürti that depicts the goddess in this mode. During the final three days, a range of warrior rites (bali, riïrâjana, astrapüjä, sastrapüja) is perfomed that conventionally granted boons useful for a king. On the benefts of Navami for instance, Srînâtha, Raghunandana's teacher, cites the Bhavisya Purãna :</page><page sequence="30">354 Bihani Sarkar О Hero, in the bright half of Ãsvina, on the ninth The meritorious fruits of one who worships the Trident-Bearing Goddess - Hear. A thousand Ašvamedha and a hundred Vajapeya sacrifices The merits thereof a man gains surrounded in heaven by many gods.77 While Durgã is in her warrior mode, the rites are Tantricised and she is increasingly homologised with the wild goddess Kali thus demonstrating the privileged position of this deity in the Bengali medieval rite. Cämündä, Kãlesvari, Vajresvarï, Lauhadandã, Vajrinï - epithets for Kali - are frequently used to invoke the goddess. Like Kali, she is worshipped in a circuit ( ãvarana ) of ferocious female deities. Sacrifices are made to appease each of the directions where these deities hover. The identity of the goddess transforms at this stage of the rite, so that her willful and untameable properties start to take over. An important rite during this period is the worship of the Nine Durgãs, well documented in cultural studies of Bhaktapur and the Kathmandu Valley.78 The Navadurgäpüjä is at present more important in Nepal than in Bengal, but its centrality in both the medieval Bengali and in the Mithilã rite of Vidyãpati shows that it may trace its history to the eastern Gangetic plains. The present Nepali worship involves participants from the Gãthã community who take on the identity of the Nine Durgãs. They wear elaborate masks depicting each of the deities and become possessed by the goddesses. They then act as their conduit during the rite and through daily processions and dancing fill the civic space of Bhaktapur with their sacred presence. The medieval Bengali rite79 does not have the element of possession so important to the Nepali rite. Instead, the goddesses are imagined and the worship is mandalic , the sacred space (which in Nepal is the town itself) being diagrammatically represented in an image of a lotus before the clay image of Durgã. Nine wild forms of the goddess, who represent her corporate identity, are contemplated, with the central being the wildest. They are called Rudracandã, Pracandã, Candogrã, Candanãyikã, Candã, CandavatI, Candarúpã, Aticandikã and Ugracandã. They are the presiding deities of the warrior part of the püjä. The eight-petalled lotus is a yantra , a potent symbol containing the mantra essences of the deities forming the very heart and soul of the goddess. This diagram appears to be what is now called the sarvatobhadramandala (where sarvatobhadra refers to the shape which is symmetrical from all angles), and worship of the Navadurgãs on MahãsatamI in this mandala survives among the Lahiris of Varanasi.80 In this, her most dangerous form(s), cognate with Kãll, the goddess holds the greatest power and is believed to grant the worshipper any boon he desires. Hence the rites post AstamI are especially potent for the power seeker desiring victory over rivals. On Navamï the regalia of kingship such as weapons and the patrons possessions are blessed with verses from the Visnudharmottara that exhort their eternal success in war.

Indeed it is one of the hallmarks of goddess worship and forms the apex of the medieval Durgä Püjä. In performing the sacrifice, the sacrificer symbolically enacts the goddess's legendary destruction of demons. The sword, the instrument of sacrifice, is described as Candikâ s tongue (rasano) in the litany of worship. Her power as pâpanâsinï (slayer of evils) is emphasised and propitiated with hymns, thereby averting potential crises. The texts suggest that three sacrifices have to be made: one on SaptamI, a second on MahãstamI, the great eighth lunar day and and a third at midnight on the arrival of MahãnavamI, the great ninth. The aims of the sacrifice, declared in the samkalpa and in the hymn for boons, are to passify the fiery Candikä, her ravenous hordes of crisis-causing mãtrs , yoginïs , demons and ghosts and to transform the sacrificer into a powerful warrior (¡ mahãbala ). She is addressed as Kãll, Mahãkãll, KausikI and "She who is surrounded by ghosts" (sarvabhãtasamãvrta) throughout the litany, epithets honouring the occultic identity she has attained in this phase, and the worshipper requests her, while holding up the chalice containing the blood, to be continually nourished with his offering ( rudhirena ãpyãyatãm). Blood is the most potent offering one may give to the goddess in order to propitiate her wild, dangerous aspect as the controller of beings of crises. It is not only rãjasika , composed of rajas, the quality believed to dominate in a virile warrior, but also the substrate of life and creation. Thus satisfying her and her hungry ghost hordes with blood, the worshipper asks continual protection from danger. A significant innovation of the sacrifice taught by Raghunandana alone is the visualisation of the sacrificial animal with Siva by the sacrificer prior to its beheading (see notes to Pasubali). I am inclined to think that the source of this innovation may lie in the Bengali pronunciation of sarvampinam ("embodiment of all"), a term used to describe the pašu in the mantra of sacrifice. Sarva and Sarva (Siva) sound the same in Bengali (. šarba ) and by this confusion the pasus epithet in the mantra becomes " sarvampinam ' ("embodiment of Siva"). This may have led Raghunandana to stipulate the meditation of the pašu as Siva. Whatever the origins of the visualisation, it achieves in underlining the strong Tantricised context of the DPT s pašubali , a first again among the Gaudlya treatises, being richly suggestive of Sãkta imagery where the goddess surmounts the corpse of Siva. It accords well with the Saiva tradition prevalent in Tamil myth, and the Kãlikã Purãna where Mahisa and Siva are identified with each other (see n. 100). Indeed in the south, Candi is thought to become Siva's consort when she slays Mahisa.82 For the more orthodox, Raghunandana provides the default option of using certain vegetables as substitutes such as the pumpkin and the sugar cane along with spirits, the offering of which is said to be as fruitful as the offering of a goat.83 Towards the end of the sacrifice, the worshipper draws a tilaka on his forehead with the offered blood and 81 atha navamïkrtyam ' tato homam kuryãt ' taddine homãsãmarthye mahãstmyãm homam kuryãt ' saktas tu ubhayadine kuryãt ' tatra svagrhyoktavidhinã baladanãmãgnim samsthãpya bilvapatrasahitais tiìair dvãdasaparvvapiirikayã ãrdrãmalakamãlayã vã uttãnakarena devatïrthena от jayantityãdisvãhãntamantrena astottarasatakrtvo juhuyãt | DPT.

On the tenth, the day the myths describe as the goddess's victory over demons, the Püjä ends with a rite of dismissal wherein the clay image, the bel branch and the nine leaves are immersed in water and farewell is symbolically expressed. Having thus completed the cycle of her transformation, the officiant returns Devi to the elements whence he had awoken her. He coaxes her to depart into the flowing current, to go to her true abode and to return the following year. The Bengali püjä thereby enacts a cyclical process of creation from Nature, followed by an assimilation with Nature at the end, with the promise of return. This may have suggested the rejuvenation of the entire cosmos. Her relinquishment to the elements was celebrated by a splendid civic festival called the "Sãvarotsava", a further specifically eastern element of the Püjä, which was evidently a time when all social constraints were let loose and caste heirarchies dissolved. The text enjoins tribal behaviour (hence the name Sãvarotsava or Festival of Tribais), persuading one to delight in sexual jokes, games, singing, dancing and spectacles, clearly indicating that the worship of the goddess was an ecstatic celebration for all, when the strict order of the Hindu domain was allowed temporary respite. The Sãvarotsava, though absent in the treatises of the west, is mentioned by eastern writers such as JImütavähana, Súlapãni, and Vidyãpati and derives from the Assamese Kãlikã Purãna, where mention of such a rite is made in 61.21- 23 a. The verse states: dhülikardamaviksepaih krïdâkautukamaùgalaih | bhagaliúgãbhidhãnais ca bhagaliňgapragttakaih || bhagaliúgãdisabdais ca kñdeyur alam janãh ' parair nãksipyate y as tu yah parãn nãksiped y adi || kruddhã bhagavati tasya sãpam dadyãt sudãrunam | Flinging dust and mud, with games, spectacles and hymns, naming the penis and the pudenda, singing songs about the penis and the pudenda. And with words such as the penis and the pudenda - Men must fully enjoy themselves. But on him who is not abused by others, nor abuses others, The goddess being angry casts a terrible curse. Licensed impropriety (behaving like a Savara; fraternising with everyone), gaiety and abandonment are what the twelfth-century JImütavähana understood the Sãvarotsava to convey, and he frankly (and without saúkã) writes "Covered in leaves etc. like one who is of the colouring of a Savara, his body caked in mud, after engaging in unrestrained dancing and singing with all and sundry. As for the games, spectacle and benedictory verses [stated in the verse] it means exactly the same".84 But the sexual overtones of the festival evidently produced mixed reactions among the smãrtas. On the one hand there is Súlapãni who clearly and unabashedly writes: "During [this festival] the naming of the penis and the pudenda, dancing and singing are compulsory",85 on the other there is Vidyãpati who seems to 'censor' any sexual reference from his version of the festival. He simply (and circumspectly) notes 84 savaravama iva parnadyavrtah kardamaliptasanro nanavidhasambaddhavalgitanrtyagitadiparo bhutveti sãvarotsavapadãrthah. krtdãkautakamaúçalaih ity asvãpy ayam evãrthah.

Perhaps, it is tempting to conjecture, his Tantric leanings evidenced in the DPT underlay his liberal spirit. It seems to me that the Bengali rite progressively develops a paradox, balancing metaphors of harvest and birth with metaphors of sacrifice and death. Through this balancing, a clear sequence of transformation emerges centred on the theme of maturation: from embryonic essence in the bilva and the water of the ghata, the Devi develops into a maiden, an idea clearly implied and honoured in the rites of adornment, then revealed in her fully matured woman's form in the splendidly attired and accoutred mürti , transformed into a wild deity with occult properties, and finally returned to essence in water. In the course of being transformed, the saumya (benevolent) and the ugra (fierce) dimensions overlap in her identity, demonstrating that to the practioner of the Bengali tradition there was no essential difference between the two aspects, that they were concieved of as different layers in a persona that was fully integrative. Indeed this was evidently the heart of her powers in the Bengali ritual. At every stage, as Durgã progresses from spirit to form ( mürti ), from harvest to war deity, she is believed to manifest her paradoxical nature and to yield specific rewards to the seeker of both martial power and the bounty of the land. At the end of this transformation, the seeker is fully empowered at all levels in the yield of crops, sons to continue his lineage and victory in his endeavours. From Raghunandana s text it is evident that the officiant can control this movement to a certain degree - and here a simile is necessary - as if he were a magician casting spells. That the worship may well have been an orthodox model of a Tantric power-ritual - where there are similar rites of subjugating the deity, forcing it to comply to the officiant s will and releasing it thereafter - is clear in the structure of the Durgã püjä : in the first part the deity is controlled in her spirit form, in the second she is worshipped in receptacles that contain her spirit, offered blood sacrifice and released in the end by the officiant during the visarjana when all powers have been claimed.

The earlier edition prepared by Jívãnanda Vidyãsãgara in 1895 in the Devanägari script is a partial text. Manuscript sources and variant readings are not noted. Furthermore, this edition only gives the first part of the DPT. Generally the DPT has been circulated in two separate parts. The first called "the Pramãna" (literally 'evidence') cites sources; the second called "the Prayoga" ('method') is the manual proper. The 1922 edition is the only one to give both sections. From the Introduction (in Bengali) we find that the edition was prepared on the basis of the following sources: (i) ms. transcribed by a certain Bhavãnanda Bhattãcãrya in 1722 Sakãbda, 1209 Vangãbda, 1800 CE and found in the village of Vasudevapura in the district of Medinïpura (Medinipore) in modern West Bengal. (ii) ms. given as a donation to the Rãjasãhí Varendra Anusandhäna Samiti by the household of Naliníkãnta Bhattãcãrya in the village of Cãmpuriyã, in the Muktãgãchã subdivision ( thãna) of the district of Mymensingh in modern Bangladesh. The ms. variants noted at the end of the printed text are all from the second manuscript (henceforth referred to as Mym), whereas the edition is entirely based on the first ms alone (henceforth called Med). Corruptions in Med are preserved in the edition. The reason for this, writes the editor, is to show the reader linguistic variations between the southern Med and the northern Mym. (iii) The Prayoga part is based on the editor s personal copy of the text as the former mss are only of the Pramãna. I have removed doubled consonants after 'r' in my transcription.</page><page sequence="35">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 359 brhaspatidaivatam от bilvavrksãya namah iti dadyãt ' tato bilvavrkse durgãm püjayet ' yathã saúkhãdipãtram purato nidhãya tribhãgam jalenäpürya tatrãksatapuspãdíni dattvã yathãlãbham vã varn iti dhenumudrayã amrtíkrtya от jayantï mangalã kâlï bhadrakãlí kapãlinx ' durgã sivã ksamã dhãtn svãhã svadhã namo'stu te || htïm от durgãyai namah ' ity astadhã japtvã tenodakena ãtmãnam püjopakaranañ ca abhyuksya от jatãjãtetyãdinã dhyãtvã svasirasi puspam dattvã mãnasopacãraih sampüjya arghyãntaram sthãpayitvã punar dhyãtvã от bhür bhuvah svar bhagavati durge ihãgaccha ihãgaccha iha tistha ity uktvã etat pãdyam от jayantïtyâdi uktvã hrïm от durgãyai namah evam arghyãdibhih pancopacãrair vã püjayet ' sambhave vastram punar ãcamaníyan ca dadyãt | tato vãdyapurahsaram añjalim badhvã pathet от ise mãsy asite pakse navamyãm ãrdrayogatah ' srtvrkse bodhayãmi tvãm yãvat pãjãm karomy aham || от aim. rãvanasya vadhãrthãya rãmasyãnugrahãya ca ' akãle brahmanã bodho devyãs tvayi krtah purã ||88 iti mantrãbhyãm devïm bodhayet | südras tu pranavavyãhrtisthãne namah ity uccãrya püjayet ' tatah suklanavamïparyantam yathãsakti durgãm püjayet ' Now [on the topic of the goddess's] Awakening. Approaching a bilva tree, sitting on a seat of darbha grass having performed the Acamana rite and taking white mustard seeds [in his hands, he utters the following two verses] : Om. Spirits, flesh-eating ogres, monsters, serpents - 88Pauränika convention holds that the year is divided into two periods {ay ana) according to the northern and southern procession of the Sun, which respectively form the day and the night of the gods (Mãrkandeya Purãna 43.3-44; Krtyatattvãrnava, p. 5). The southern ayana (daksinãyana) is the period between the summer solstice and the winter solstice. As Ãsvina falls in the daksinãyana, the 'awakening' of Durgã in this month is regarded as "untimely" (akãle bodhanam), since it forms the time of Durgã s sleep. Hence the eastern ãsvinanavarãtra includes as an opening rite the rousing of Durgã from her slumber, the Bodhana (Awakening). On this subject Raghunandana writes in the Pramãna section of the DPT: rãtrãv èva mahãmãyã brahmanã bodhitã purã ' tathaiva ca narãh kury uh pratisamvatsaram nrpa || iti rãtrãv èva bodhanam iti vãcyam ' tatra rãtripadena devasambandhitvena daksinãyanasyoktatvãt 'tathã ca šrutih tapãs ca tapasyas ca saisirãv rtu , madhus ca mãdhavas ca vãsantikãv rtu, sukras ca sueis ca graismãv rtü, athaitad udagayanam devãnãm dinam, nabhãs ca nabhasyaš ca vãrsikãv rtü, isas ca ürjas ca sãradãv rtü, sahaš ca sahasyas ca haimantikãv rtü, athaitad daksinãyanam devãnãm rãtrih iti ' It was at night that Brahmã awoke Mahãmãyã long ago. Year by year must men perform the very same О King. In the verse, it is the ritual of the Awakening which is indicated [as being held] "only at night", because the word 'night' therein indicates the Southern Procession ( daksinãyana ), since it is related to the [night of the] gods. As the scripture states, Tapas and Tapasya [month between winter and spring, and Phãlguna] are the months of late winter; Madhu and Mãdhava [Caitra and Vaisãkha] are the months of spring; Sukra and Suei [Jyesthã and Ãsãdha] are the months of summer. Thus this [period] of the Northern Procession, (udagayana) [forms] the daytime of the gods. Nabhas and Nabhasya [Srãvana and Bhãdra] are the months of the monsoon; Isa and Ürja [Sarat and Kãrttika] are the months of autumn; Saha and Sahasya [Mârgasïrsa and Pausa] are the months of early winter. Thus this [period] of the Southern Procession ( daksinãyana ) forms the night time of the gods.' Eastern versions of the Rãmãyana, such as Krttivâsa's (Krttivãsl-Rãmãyan, "Lankãkãnda, pp. 382-389) and some Purãnas (Kãlikã Purãna, 60. 25-30), also mention that she was awakened in the bright half of Ãsvina in order to aid Rãma in his battle against Rãvana. This is the standard reason used by exegetes to explain why the Püjä is celebrated in autumn. In contrast, Durgä's spring festival in Caitra is often considered to be the 'proper' festival given that it falls within the period conventionally held to be the time that gods are awake and active. There is thus no bodhana rite performed for the spring festival.</page><page sequence="36">Збо Bihani Sarkar May they disperse, and all others who cause obstacles! "Om. May impediments, producers of impediments and terrifying flesh-eaters who are enemies of the sacrifice scatter in all directions, banished by me with white mustard [whose power] is the same as the thunderbolt.89 After removing obstacle causers by scattering white mustard seeds while [reciting] the two mantras, installing the pot while [reciting] the Gãyatrí mantra, he must worship [the Sun] in the water inside the pot etc. with this [mantra] "Om. Homage to the Sun". After worshipping the planets in the same manner with [their respective mantras] as follows - '[Homage] to the Moon', 'to Mars', 'to Mercury', 'to Jupiter' (brhaspataye) , 'to Venus', 'to Saturn', 'to Rãhu' and 'to Ketu' ( ketubhyah )90 - he must worship the Five Gods. "Here is the perfume. Om homage to the sun [with this formula] he must worship [the Five Gods] with the Five Upãcãras91 or [optionally with offerings of] perfumed powders and flowers. Thus having worshipped Ganeša, Durgä, Siva and Visnu, he must ritually establish the guest water. After placing dürvä grass, unhusked barley, yoghurt and flowers or whatever is in his means in a shell or other chalice, [ritually] transforming the water into nectar with the Dhenu gesture [while reciting the mantra] "Vam", reciting [the mantra] "Om. Homage to the Bilva Tree" eight times and sprinkling himself and the ritual implements with that water [he chants] to the bilva tree, "This is the water for washing your feet. Om Homage to the bilva tree". For chanters of the Sãma veda [the mantra is] "This is the guest water". For others, [it is] "Here is the guest water".92 He must worship [the bilva tree] with the five upacãras or with perfume and flowers. If he can afford it he must offer [garments with the mantra] "This is the garment, whose presiding deity is Brhaspati. Om Homage to the bilva tree". Then he must worship Durgä in the bilva tree as follows: after placing the chalice of shell or another substance before him, filling it three-quarters with water, placing unhusked barley, flowers etc. therein, or whatever he can procure and ritually transforming [the water in the chalice] into nectar with the Dhenu gesture [while reciting the seed syllable] "Vam", [he recites the following verse] : 'Om Jayantï, Maúgalã, Kali, Bhadrakâlï, Kapãlim Durgã, Sivã, Ksamã, Dhãtr, Svãhã, Svadhã - Homage to thee. Hñm От Homage to Durgã' 89 My translation is a little forced, as the reading given in the edition is tautological (samãna and kalpair, having the same meaning). It had probably been kept by the editors for the sake of the metre ( upajãti ). The problem is with ' kalpair at the end of the compound as we must then translate the whole word as something like 'the same in resemblance to a vajra', which is redundant. However ' vajrasamãna coupled with other nouns does occur (for example, Mbh 1.180.15b: vajrasamãnavtrya; Mbh 8.65.13d [1040-10], Rämäyana 6.57.87a: vajrasamãnavega ; Monier Williams: vajrasamãnasãrá) . АД these examples in a plural instrumental would fit the metre, and would also be appropriate in the context it is used in the verse. This is possibly a corruption in the edition, and does not make sense unless the names of the planets were compounded together as ' somamaňgalabudhabrhaspatišukrašanaišcararáhuketubhyali . For the time being I am translating it as if it were in the single dative (ketave). The five preliminary oblations Opacaras are offerings of incense ( dhupa ), flowers (puspa), fruit (phala), light (dTpa) and cooked food ( naivedya ). These two lines imply that the officiants using Raghunandana s text were mainly SãmavedI brahmins. Most brahmins in Bengal at this time were specialists of the Sãma Veda, while the rest specialised in the White Yajur Veda and the Rg [B.Bhattãcãryã 1955, p. 12]. Three of Raghunandana 's works are specifically written for the SãmavedI and the YajurvedT brahmin - the Chandogavrsotsargatattva , the Yajurvedivrsotsargatattva and the Yajurvedisrãddhatattva.</page><page sequence="37">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 361 After reciting [this] eighteen times, sprinkling himself and the ritual implements with that water, visualising [himself as the deity] and beginning with "Om. She with the coils of matted hair", then placing the flower on his head, worshipping internally with mental offerings, placing another chalice and revisualising [himself as the deity], reciting [the mantra] "Om. Earth, middle earth, heaven О Goddess Durgã, Come here! Come here! Stay here! Stay here!", then reciting [the mantra beginning with] "This is the water for washing the feet. Om JayantI ..." [while offering the water for the feet and after completing the recitation with] "Hrim Om Homage to Durgã", he must worship in the same way with the guest water and other [offerings] or with the five upacãras. If he can afford it, he must offer a garment and the sipping water afterwards. Then, folding his hands after offering music, he must recite: Om, In the dark half-month during Ãsvina, on the ninth conjoined with Ãrdra, In the bilva tree I awaken you, so that I can perform your worship Om aim To slay Rãvana and to favour Rãma Did Brahmã unseasonably perform the goddess's Awakening in your case.93 He must awaken the goddess with these two mantras. But the Südra must worship after saying 'Homage' instead of saying 'Om'. Then he must worship Durgã up to the ninth in the bright phase according to his means.

After thus declaring the Samkalpa [the formal Declaration of Intent], reciting the verse "Om Devo vah", setting up the pot and worshipping Durgã as before, he must offer substances for coiffuring the hair, such as perfume, the fruit of the Emlic myrobalan and a comb. In the same way, on the second [he must offer] a silken cord for tying the hair, on the third red lac dye to redden her feet, vermillion to wear on [the middle parting of] her hair, a mirror to view [her] face, on the fourth a mixture of milk and honey, silver etc. for shaping the ' tïlaka mark, collyrium to anoint [her] eyes; on the fifth he must offer sandalwood, unguents and ornaments according to his means. 93 If the Bodhana is performed on the evening of SasthI, the appropriate invocation given in the DPT is: Om Aim To slay Rãvana and to favour Rãma ( rãvanasya vadhãrthãya rãmasyãnugrahãya ca) Did Brahmã unseasonably wake the goddess inside you long ago. (akãle brahmanã bodho devyãs tvayi krtah pura) Thus too shall I awaken [her] on the eve of the sixth in Ãsvina. ( aham api ãsvine sasthyãm sãyãhne bodhayãmy atah). The same verses for the bodhana appear in such early Western writers as Bhojarãja and Hemãdri.

In a courdy context, the bali is often heavily tantricised as the assumption is that the Tantrik bali is more effective in procuring victory. Kãlí is a strong presence in this part.

Vidyãpati includes, in addition to the animals mentioned over here, the offering of a human head ( narasirah pradâna). Durgâbhaktitaranginï, p. 189. The identification of the sacrificial animal with Siva appears to be unique to the bait in the Dr 1. As evidence, Raghunanandana cites the following passage from the Kãlikã Purãna, where Siva describes the sacrificial animal as embodying himself ( matsvarüpinam ). In the Kãlikã Purãna 60.146 a legend appears where Siva {giñsa) is described as being incarnated as Mahisa in the womb of a female buffalo. In brief, the background to this event is as follows. Mahisa's father Rambha is a devout follower of Siva. Pleased with his worship, Siva grants him a boon that he himself will be born as Rambha s son. On his way home, Rambha falls madly in love with a young and pleasing she-buffalo, whom he impregnates. Siva imbues the foetus in the buffalo's womb with a portion from his body. Similar myths where Mahisãsura is depicted in a sympathetic light as a Siva devotee and a 'portion descendant' ( amsãvatãra ) of Siva also appear in Tamil texts from the period such as the Arunãcalapurãna, a study of which appears in Shulman 1976, pp. 122-123. There is no mention of Siva being the sacrificial animal in texts from the early medieval period which leads me to believe that it is a medieval development.</page><page sequence="46">37° Bihani Sarkar raktambaradharañ caiva pãsahastam kutumbinam | pibamãnan ca rudhiram bhunjãnam kravyasamhatim ' evam khadgam dhyãtvã от rasano, tvam candikãyãh suralokaprasãdhakah | ity abhimantrya hrïm sñm khadgãya namah iti gandãdibhih sampüjya от asir višasanah khadgas ttksnadhãro durãsadah ' mgarbho vijayas caiva dharmapãla namo's tu te | ity astau tava nãmãni svayam uktãni vedhasã | naksatram krttikã tubhyam gurur devo mahesvarah || hiranyañ ca sarïram te dhãtã devo janãrddanah | pita pitãmaho devas tvam mãm palay a sarvvadã || ntlajímãtasamkãsas tïksnadamstrah kršodarah ' bhãvasuddho 'mars anaš ca atitejãs tathaiva ca ' iyam yena dhrtã ksaunï hatas ca mahisãsurah ' tiksnadhãrãya suddhãya tasmai khadgãya te namah || iti puspam dadyãt ' ãm hrxm phat iti khadgãm ãdãya от kãli kãli vajresvari lauhadandãyai namah iti japtvã pürväbhimukham balim svayam uttarãbhimukhah, balim uttarãbhimukham svayam pürväbhimukho vã sakrc chindyãt | tato mrnmayãdipãtre rudhiram ãdãya devïsammukhe sthãpayitvã от adyetyãdi dasavarsãvacchinnasrtdurgãpntikãma imam chãgapasurudhirabalim dãsyãmi iti samkalpya esa chãgapasurudhirabalih от jayantityãdy uccãrya dadyãt ' tatah от kãli kãli mahãkãli kãlike pãpanãsini ' sonitañ ca balim grhna varade vãmalocane || aim Mm srïm kausiki rudhirenãpyãyatãm iti vadet ' tatas chãgasirasi jvaladdasãm dattvã от adyetyãdi dasavarsãvachinnasrídurgãpntikãma imam sapradïpacchâgapasusïrsabalim dãsyãmi iti samkalpya esa sapradïpacchâgapasusïrsabalih от jayantityãdy uccãrya dadyãt ' tatah от jaya tvam sarvabhãtese sarvabhãtasamãvrte | raksa mãm nijabhütebhyo balim bhuñksva namo'stu te || ity uktvã khadgarudhiram ãdãya -

Having held the sword chanting "Am hnm phat", having uttered "Om Kall Kali, goddess of the thunder bolt, Homage to the goddess of the Iron Stake, he must decapitate the animal with one stroke while it faces the east and he faces the north, or the animal faces the north and he faces the east. Then, having collected the blood in a chalice of such a substance as earth, having placed it before the goddess and having declared the Resolution: "Om Today etc. I who wish for Durgã s affection for a duration of ten years give this bali offering of goat s blood and having recited "Here is the bali offering of goat's blood.

But for a buffalo sacrifice, he must not consecrate [the animal] with the mantras beginning with "Fire was the sacrifice" while [making] this offering because Agastya has [already] consecrated the buffalo since it is a forest animal.

Having thus worshipped with perfumes etc., he must say "O Animal" as a modification here where 'Goat' [was used]. But when the blood is offered, the reward is Durga's affection for a hundred years. Everything else is as before. If a sheep is sacrificed, [the term] 'Sheep' is to be used as a modification. Everything else is as [stated] before. But if he offers blood from his body [the modification is] "Here is the bali offering of blood from my body:</page><page sequence="50">374 Bihani Sarkar От О Mahãmãyã, Mother of the Universe, Bestower of all desires I give blood from my body. Grant me grace. Bestow boons. Saying thus, he must offer [the blood] chanting "От JayantI. . . ". If there are many animal sacrifices, having grouped [them in] twos or threes before [the goddess] and having consecrated them and having worshipped them with "Homage to this and that animal" [he must sacrifice] using "O Goat You" without modification into the plural. The same is done even in the case of other animals. But [the modification] in the [sacrificer s] utterance is: "I who wish to become powerful, who wish incomparable wealth or [he may say] who wish to please Durgã shall slay these animals". When offering blood [the modification is] "Here is the bali offering of animal blood. От JayantI ..." Having said this [he must chant] "Hrlm От Homage to Durgã." When offering the head of the animal, [the modification is] "The bali offering of an animal head with a lamp" as before. He may give a bali offering of a pumpkin and a sugar cane. Then having uttered the mantra beginning with "От JayantI" as many times as he can [he must pray]: You are One who protects the secret and the supreme secret. Accept the prayer I have performed May I have success goddess by your grace, О Mahešvarí. Saying this he must offer the prayer. Then, he must recite the hymn which is as follows: От Before Durgã, the benevolent, who removes danger, Brahmani the beloved of Brahmã Leader of all worlds, Sadãsivã - I prostrate myself Before her who is auspicious, beautiful, pure, partless and the supreme power104 The Goddess of the Universe, Mother of the Universe, Candikã - I prostrate myself Before the goddess who embodies all the gods, who removes fear from all men One who is paid homage by Brahmã, Isa and Visnu, who is Sadãsivã - I prostrate myself Before her who dwells in the Vindhyas, whose abode is the Vindhyas, who dwells in a celestial place, Yoginï, the Mother of Yoga, Candikã - I prostrate myself Before the goddess who is ïsâna s mother, Îsvarî, adored by Isvara Durgã, who enables us to cross samsãra s ocean - I have prostrated myself for all time The man who recites this hymn or listens to it Rejoices with Durgã freed from all sins. Now the Prayer for Boons: От. Slayer of the buffalo, Mahãmãyã, Cãmundã, Garlanded with heads Grant me long life, health and victory goddess. Homage to you From demons, ghosts, flesh-eaters and Raksases О Supreme Goddess From dangers, men and gods protect me eternally О One auspicious with all good portents, benevolent, fully replete in wealth Umã, Brahmãnl, Kaumãrl, Omniform, grant me grace Bestow beauty, bestow fame, bestow good fortune on me О goddess 104The pun is with kalã meaning part/form and a digit of the moon. Here a paradox is being expressed: the goddess is both 'niskala that is partless and the ' paramãm kalãm the supreme form and also the highest kalã, the sixteenth digit of the moon. Durgã and the moon are closely associated in ritual and astrology.</page><page sequence="51">The Rite of Durga in Medieval Bengal 375 Bestow sons, bestow wealth, bestow all my desires on me О One Smeared with sandalwood, anointed with turmeric With a chaplet of bilva leaves О Durgä, I have come to you for refuge. Thus reciting, he must offer three cupped handfuls of flowers with the base mantra. Then, having brought near [the goddess] rice, spiced dishes, cakes, pâyasa etc. at the appropriate hour and having offered them with the aforementioned mantra, he must offer perfumed water for drinking, water for sipping and purifying and betel nut. He must pass the time remaining with songs, musical instruments etc. (vii) Tantricised Rites - The Bhütasuddhi (Purification of Gross Elements), Aňganyasa (Installation of Ancillary Mantras), Añgapüja

In this [sequence], on the eighth lunar day either conjoined with Pürväsädha or not, after sitting down on a seat of Darbha grass facing east or north, having bathed etc. and sipped the water for purification, a man must perform the Purification of the Gross elements as follows Having united the Individual Soul with the Supreme Soul in the heart [by drawing it up] from the navel with the mantra "I am that one"and after introducing earth in water, water in fire, fire in wind and wind in ether, having held the right nostril with the right thumb and after dessicating the body by chanting the wind seed syllable 'Yam' sixteen times with the Vayavï visualisation known as the Püraka1 06 /Inhalation, whose nature is to increase [the body] with wind and having held both nostrils with the thumb and the ring finger, having burnt the body by chanting the fire seed syllable 'Ram' sixty-four times with the Ãgneyl visualisation, the contemplation of fire known as as the Kumbhaka/Pot107 whose nature is to stop the breath, having made [the body] firm by chanting the earth seed syllable 'Lam' 105 A parallel to a similar apotropaic rite to Skanda, the grahas and the mãtrs is found in the Atharvaveda Parišista 20.2.9. It seems plausible that Durgä may have replaced Skanda, and yogints associated with that older worship have been assimilated into her retinue with some nominal modifications recognisable to a smãrta. However it is beyond the scope of this paper to study this in depth. The first stage of yogic breath control (pranavama ) when the breath is inhaled.

Next, Restraining the Breaths.

Here is the bali offering of rice mixed with lentils. Homage to jackals and so forth. (viii) The worship of the Nine Purgas (Navadurgãpãjã) (Worship of the Nine Purgas):116 116The nine forms may be connected to the nine nights of the Navarätra, with each having special relevance to a tithi. The connection appears to be made etymologically - the name of each of these deities is a modification of the root 'canď (to be angry) and Candl/Candikã is a common epithet for Durgã. Reference to the Navadurgäs is made in the Kãlikã Purãna where 59. 22-23 says: "One should always contemplate (satatam cintayet) the goddess, bestower of Dharma, sexual pleasure, wealth and liberation ( dharmakãmãrthamoksadãm ), accompanied by these eight Saktis i.e. Ugracandã, Pracandã, Candogrã, Candanãyikã, Canda, Candavatï, Cãmundã and Candikã." The original verses are as follows: ugracandã pracandã ca candogrã candanãyikã ' candã candavatï caiva cãmundã candikã tathã || ãbhih saktibhir astãbhih satatam parivestitãm ' cintayet satatam devïm dharmakãmãrthamoksadãm ' A more elaborate description is given in the Agni Purãna which contains iconographical details, the mantra for worship and the benefits obtained from the rite. The description says that nine forms of Durgã are worshipped in either a site with a nine-[petalled] lotus ( navapadmãtmake sthãne), nine houses (navagehastha) or in one (ekãgãrasthita) . The verses are as follows: navapadmãtmake sthãne pujyã durgã svamürtitah / / ãdau madhye tathendrãdau navãtattvãtmabhih kramãt / astãdasabhujaikã tu dakse mundam ca khetakam // ãdarsatarjanícãpam dhvajam damarukam tathã / pãsam vãme bibhratí ca saktimudgarasülakam / / vajrakhadgãnkusasarãn cakran devi salãkayã / etair evãyudhair yuktã sesãh sodasabahukãh // damarum tarjanïm tyaktvã rudracandãdayo nava / rudracandã pracandã ca candogrã candanãyikã // candã candavatï caiva candarupãticandikã / ugracandã ca madhyasthã rocanãbhãrunãsitã / / nilã suklã dhumrikã ca pítã svetã ca simhagãh / mahisotha pumãn sastñ tatkacagrahamustikãh // âlïdhâ nava durgãh syuh sthãpyãh putrãdivrddhaye /(Agni Purãna 50.6-i3ab) For navatattvãtmabhih Candešvara reads navatattvãksaraih (with the Nine-Truth syllables). He then glosses the latter as " durge durge raksani svãheti navatattvãksarãni", The Nine-Truth Syllables are "O Durgã, Durgã, Protectoress! Svãhã" (Krtyaratnãkara, p.362). This reading of course yields greater sense in the ritual context where " navatattvãtmabhih" is implausible. The second passage on the Navadurgäs is: durgã tu navagehasthã ekãgãrasthitãthavã // pújitãstãdasabhujã sesãh sodasamatkarãh / sesãh sodasahastãh syur añjanam damarun tathã // rudracandã pracandã ca candogrã candanãyikã / candã candavatï pujyã candarupãticandikã / /</page><page sequence="56">380 Bihani Sarkar tato devyãh puratah padmam nirmãya prãgãdidalesu kamikãyãm jale vã etat pãdyam om rudracandãyai namah ' abhãve pancopacãrair gandhapuspãbhyãm vã püjayet ' evam pracandãyai, candogrãyai, candanãyikãyai, candãyai, candavatyai, candampãyai, aticandikãyai, madhye ugracandãyai ' tatra от daksayajnavinãsinyai mahãghorãyai yoginïkotiparivrtâyai bhadrakãlyai hñm от durgãyai namah iti puspãnjalitrayena püjayet | 1 17 Next, having drawn a lotus before the goddess [he must offer the foot water] on either the petals starting from the east, the pericarp or in water [with]: "This is the foot water. Om Homage to Rudracandä". In the absence of the foot water ( abhãve)ns , he must worship with either the five upãcãras or with perfumed powders and flowers. Likewise [he worships the remaining deities with] : "Pracandãyai, Candogrãyai, Candanãyikãyai, Candãyai, Candavatyai, Candariipãyai, Aticandikãyai." In the middle: "Ugracandãyai." In that position he must worship [Durgã as Bhadrakâlï] with three cupped handfuls of flowers [chanting]: "Om To Bhadrakâlï, the destroyer of Daksa s sacrifice, immensely terrifying, surrounded by a crore of yoginïs - Hñm От Homage to Durgã ." kramãnmadhye cogracandã durgã mahisamardim / от âurge durge raksani svãhã dasãksaro mantrah / / dírghãkãrãdimantrãdir navanetro namo 'titikah / sadbhih padair namahsvadhãvasatkãrahrdãdikam / / aúgusthãdikanisthãntam nyasyãúgãni japec chivãm / etañjapati yo guhyam nãsau kenãpi bãdhyate // (Agni Puräna 185.3-8) During the time of the Pãlas, the Navadurgäs formed a patronised cult. The Siyan Stone Inscription of Nayapäla records the institution of a shrine to the Navacandikãs by the king. Epigraphia Indica 39. II. 7 For zpaddhati on Ugracandä see Ugracandãpaddhati, cited in Sanderson 2009, p. 112, n. 237. Raghunandananana says nothing on the appearance of the nine which suggests that they were not represented diagramatically in the worship he advocates. However Vidyãpati states that they are painted on the ground and gives us some details on their iconography. These conform to the description of the goddesses in the Agni Puräna. Eight are sixteen-armed. The left hands hold a skull, a shield, a bell, a mirror, a bow, a crested banner, a noose and a lance. The right hands hold a mallet, a trident, a thunderbolt, a sword, an elephant goad, an arrow, a discus and a dart. Each is represented consecutively from the east on eight petals drawn with turmeric. Brightly yellow Rudracanda stands on the eastern petal; flame-coloured Pracandã stands on the south-eastern petal; dark Candogrä stands on the southern petal; blue-coloured Candanäyikä on the south-western; fair-complexioned Candâ on the western; smoke-hued CandavatI on the north-western; yellow Candarüpä on the northern; pale-hued Aticandikä on the north-eastern. In the centre of the pericarp stands the ninth - flame-coloured eighteen armed Ugracandä. In her left hands she holds a skull, a shield, a bell, a mirror, showing the tarjanï (threatening) gesture, a bow, a crested banner, a damaru and a noose. In her right hands she carries a spear, a mallet, a trident, a thunderbolt, a sword, an elephant goad, a discus and a dart. She is shown standing on a lion in the warrior pose with her right knee advanced, firmly grasping in the fist of her bottom-right hand the coil of hair on a sword-bearing demon s head, seen emerging from the decapitated body of a buffalo. Her breasts and thighs are full and pleasing.

In fact in the event the performer cannot carry out the full ten-day worship, Raghunandana gives the option of a condensed version based on the rites after Astamï. This was deemed enough to satisfy the goddess and suggests how important the Astaml-NavamI rites were in the history of the Durgä Püjä. 12Uapanïya ed.] upanïya Conj.
