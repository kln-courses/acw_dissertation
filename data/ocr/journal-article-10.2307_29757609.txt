<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beyond Gogdara I New Evidence of Rock Carvings and Rock Artefacts from the Kandak Valley and Adjacent Areas (Swat, Pakistan) by luca M. olivieri and Massimo Vidale Introduction In February 1870, during a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta, J.H. Rivett-Carnac pointed out the strong similarity between the cup-marked rock monuments of the 'British Isles' and the Himalayan and central Indian ones. Later, he published for the Society two papers in which he described a series of cup-marks he had observed on some prehistoric monuments in Kumaon and central India (Rivett-Carnac 1877, 1879). In 1883 his view was summarized in a short article in the Saturday Review (56, 24th November 1883, pp. 662-63). Cup-marks continued to fascinate this scholar, if twenty years later he attempted to explain the variability or, in his own words, the 'permutations' in the cup-marks as a proto-writing code (Id. 1903). His points may be summarized as follows: 1) the identity between the Indian cup-marks and those he had seen in Europe; 2) the fact that both in India and in Europe cup-marks appeared on megalithic slabs and boulders surrounding prehistoric mounds and burrows; 3) the fact that the variable linear series of the Indian cup-marks, like the European examples, and the alternation of large and small cups should be considered 'permutations' of a coherent graphic code (it is amazing how he anticipated one of the basic concepts of structuralism), if not a proto-writing system; 4) the presence of cup-marks in the rocks surrounding 'Mahadeo' shrines and temples; 5) their association, in one case, with iron artefacts; 6) the association of cup-marks with carvings depicting lingam and yoni signs, and consequently their probable association with a Vedic or proto-Vedic religious background. J.H. Rivett-Carnac's arguments were sound, logical and bold; his tables are well constructed, concise and clear (Fig. 1). His approach was fully inspired by late 19th century positivist science and by a cross-cultural evolutionary perspective. Probably The present research was carried out on a fifty-fifty basis by both authors. [1] 121</page><page sequence="2">?Kir M 'if Fig. 1 - 'Ancient Rock Sculpturings in Kamaon, India'. (After Rivett-Carnac 1877: pi.

In resurrecting this old field of study, we feel some fear but also a form of pride, as we enter (or re-enter) an archaeological field that in the last century fell victim to widespread discredit. The reasons are well known. One of the main problems is the decline in interest, in the second half of the past century, in cross-cultural research (a dimension we deem as unescapable, in the perspective of studying Eurasia, and not only 'the East'). Rock art and artefacts excavated in rock notoriously represent one of the most difficult subjects in archaeology, because of the lack of preserved archaeological contexts and of reliable ways of testing one's hypotheses. In a previous paper dealing with the painted rock shelters of Kandak, we put in play different ways for providing a chronological assessment: comparisons with the iconographic repertories of the Upper Indus-Karakorum that (at least for the later Buddhist rock art) may be dated with some confidence; evaluation of the topographic setting of the rock shelters, their overall relationship to the territory of the valley and the other sites; a careful analysis of depictions of animals and objects (weapons and possible agricultural tools) observed in the shelters (Vidale &amp;Olivieri2002). In this second paper, we deal with five different types of rock artefacts, scattered in a much wider and diversified area of the Kandak valley, whose chronology, with few exceptions, is highly uncertain. These artefacts are: 1) wheel-designs, sometimes having an inner cross, and other linear patterns carved by a dot-mark technique on stone slabs, boulders and outcropping rocks; 2) large boulders, rocks or slabs decorated by incised cup-marks and/or carved grooves; 3) rock shelters and walls bearing figurative linear designs; 4) tanks and basins cut out of the rock; 5) outcropping boulders intensively worn by sharpening stone and metallic axes (axe sharpeners). Representational carvings are, to a great extent, abstract, and designs of material objects are few and poorly characterized. The highest peak of uncertainty is reached when dealing with cup-marks and the related incisions, artefacts that are distributed in different regions of the world, created in identical forms by completely different cultures, in different times and possibly having highly variable practical and/or symbolic functions. Such a slippery ground explains why scientific archaeology is often reluctant to take similar evidence into account, and 'wild' interpretations crowd the available bibliography with numberless (and often useless) papers; and to extract useful suggestions from this tangle is a quite difficult task. Nonetheless, just like Rivett-Carnac, we were struck by the strong similarities between some of the Kandak rock artefacts and those documented, for example, in the Alps region; we [3] 123</page><page sequence="4">will propose, as working hypotheses, that part of our rock artefacts should actually be dated to late protohistoric times, and that some of these expressions might be representational (and might have, as a consequence, important symbolic values). These are serious archaeological issues, and, if tackled with the care required by the case, might reveal important aspects of the adaptation processes of complex societies in the mountain areas of the north-western regions of the Subcontinent, as well as of the cultural history of Swat. General Features The Kandak stream runs through a valley winding from south to north, debouching into the Swat, from the left, in front of the rocky outcrop of Barikot (Bir-kot-ghwandai), after an arc-shaped flow about 10 km long. Barikot (the ancient Bazira) is one of the main protohistorical and historical towns of Middle Swat and probably the best known archaeological site in the whole valley (for references, see Callieri et al. 2000; Olivieri 2003). The Kandak valley is a natural access leading from Swat to Buner, as well as to the Mardan plain. It is also a part of one of the most important sub-regional itineraries along the ancient route connecting the middle course of the Kunar (now in north-eastern Afghanistan) to the middle Indus valley (see the references in Olivieri 1996). The Barikot area is the topographic end of the Kandak valley, while its rocky elevation represents an ideal point of control and military defence. Because of its orographic features, the Kandak valley represents both a possible transit and a restricted territory, hardly accessible and relatively easy to close and defend. This is also reflected in the recent history of the valley: even today, among the left affluents of the Swat, the Kandak valley lacks a paved road. Kandak presents an uncommon evolutionary lag, and it resembles more remote areas in Swat Kohistan than with Middle Swat (*). The archaeological survey provided substantial information on the still poorly known non-buddhist rock art of Swat. Besides the reports on the rock carvings of Hathiano-kandao (on the south? western watershed of Kandak; Nazir Ahmad Khan 1983), the painted shelters of the nearby valley of Kafir-kot (Olivieri in Nazir Ahmad Khan et al. 1995) and the site of Gogdara I (Olivieri 1998), previous information includes De Terra &amp; Paterson 1939; Foucher 1942-1947; Gordon 1958; Paterson &amp; Drummond 1962; Mian Said Qamar 1974-1986; Shah Nazar Khan 1995; Saeed-Ur-Rehman 1996; Luft-ur Rehman 1997; Muhammad Ashraf Khan et al. 1999-2000; Badshah Sardar 2000; Nasim Khan 2000; (*) The hydronym kandak might not be a Pashtu word (as previously stated by us: kandak = stony, khandak = ditch, moat; see Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002: 173). The hydronyms gandak and gandaki (respectively in northern India and Nepal), according to M. Witzel (1995), recall the Munda word for 'water', gandak. 124 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Muhammad Ashraf Khan et al. 2002; Ihsan Ali 2003. No comprehensive studies have been attempted so far (2). The field survey was carried out between October 20th and November 20th, 2000 (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002; Laurenza &amp; Vidale, forthcoming). The valley was selected as the subject of a field test of a wider exploration program aimed at creating a more extensive Archaeological Map of Swat (AMSV), after an original project by D. Faccenna. The limited size of the valley, its geomorphological unity and its close connection with the site of Barikot (towards which the efforts of the Italian Archaeological Mission were directed over the last 15 years), were additional reasons for this choice (3). The survey carried out in 2000 led to the discovery of a long series of new buddhist sacred areas. In this paper we deal with the identification of a substantial series of prehistoric, pre-buddhist or non-buddhist sites, and in particular of locations distinguished by the above-mentioned rock carvings and rock artefacts, in general referrable to settlement phases that both chronologically and culturally may be considered non-buddhist (4). In the short time available for the survey - and the areas we visited were not always considered safe by our guides - some rock shelters and artefacts were briefly described in a field book and documented by sketches and photographs, while others, in a limited number of cases (for example, the painted rock shelters published in Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002) were documented by the means of contact-tracing on transparent sheets. Geological, Geomorphological and Topographical Features From a geological viewpoint, the Kandak valley is bound to the west by the ridge of Jaurbanda-ghar, with powerful outcrops of Augen-gneisses having a strongly washed-off 'inselberg' morphology that is part of the so-called 'Jambil Unit'. The same natural formation is visible at the end of the valley, where it can be followed along the Mt Ham Range (interrupted at the Karakar pass by outcropping granites with tourmaline), all along the watershed separating Swat from Buner. The bottom of the valley is covered by pleistocenic and later sediments, with alternating (2) A general reappraisal of the Swat data is forthcoming (Olivieri, forthcoming c), as the second volume of a publication on rock art in Swat; the volume dedicated to late-ancient buddhist rock art is edited by A. Filigenzi (forthcoming). (3) In Spring 2004, the present authors, in collaboration with Mr Tahir Saeed, Representative of the Dept. of Archaeology &amp; Museums, Govt. of Pakistan, carried out further research in the valleys of Kandak, Najigram and Kotah. Over 50 new sites were identified, including numerous cup-marks, rock artefacts and rock-art sites. Although the definitive results will soon be available in the announced work of general reappraisal (Olivieri, forthcoming c), we felt that, for the sake of greater completeness, it was fitting to anticipate some new evidence from the outset whenever deemed useful to update and complete those obtained during the 2000 reconnaissance. (4) The painted rock shelters found in the survey have been already published in this journal (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002). [5] 125</page><page sequence="6">sequences of silt, sandy silt and gravels, up to a maximum thickness of 7-10 m. The eastern slopes (Sur-ghar) are distinguished by chloritoid phyllites and garnet kyanite-staurolite-gneisses, topped by the typical limestone formation of the southern scarps of the Barikot hill (Di Florio et al. 1993; C. Faccenna et al. 1993; Olivieri, forthcoming c). Before debouching into the Swat, the Kandak meets the ridges of Chirgai-gat, formed by schists with garnets and quartz veins. This crest, oriented in a south-west north-east direction, is strongly inclined to the south. It is separated from Jaurbanda-ghar by the pass called Ghaka-kandao, and deviates appreciably to the north-east before encountering the Barikot hill. The Kandak thus runs between two parallel ridges having an average height of 1500 m asl. The stream in winter is low in water, while in summer it is completely dry, although the occasional, violent rains of the monsoon change it into a ravening flow of muddy water. The silt deposited on its terraces, as well as the present agricultural soils, presently provide raw material for the production of ceramics, plaster and bricks. At the mouth of the valley, the seasonal streams, enhanced by wide-scale erosion caused by the unstable, artificial surfaces created by recent earthworks, cut alluvial banks rich in gravel, pebbles and boulders to a maximum depth of 20-30 m and expose the local, thick pleistocenic conoids in deep ravines. On the eastern side of the Kandak s mouth a series of cultivated terraces are visible. Here mostly fruit plantations are cultivated (besides walnut, apricot, citruses and persimmon trees), interspersed with lots hosting cereals. On the opposite side, a track runs through other orchards and vegetable gardens, and a gentle, wide slope recently shaped by extensive earthworks carried out by earthmoving equipment joins the foot of the mountains to the bottom of the valley. Near the Kandak's mouth, the eastern slope, made of alluvial silty banks covered by colluvial sediments rich in gravel (from coarse to fine), with an average slope of 10-20%, faces the western slope, with a much steeper gradient. The best fields, favoured by the deposition of the finer fractions, are obviously located downslope. About 3 km upstream, the Kandak forms a larger bend, and the two slopes widen, creating a large, symmetric plateau of silty terraces, at present intensively exploited by the means of artificial irrigation. Moving further upstream, agricultural soils become richer in sand, both because of the hydraulic-gravitational selection of alluvial sediments and the intense erosion and proximal redeposition, of coarse sedimentary fractions of the local lithosoils and rocky substrata (mainly formed by micaschist). Here the bottom of the valley is stony, sterile. The traditional pattern of land property, in the lower valley, provides for the subdivision of the land into long parallel strips that run from the watershed to the fields on the terraces, ensuring an egalitarian sharing of the most favorable plots among the owners' families. In the upper valley, the eastern side is formed by steep slopes created by the differential erosion of micaschists alternating with garnet-bearing schists, and is quite unsuitable for farming. On the lower slopes, the villages of 126 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Kandak and Jahangir control the limited agricultural land still protected by unstable terraces. Agriculture and human settlements closely depend on the availability of water, and in the Kandak, generally speaking, springs are few. South of the present village of Balah-kalai, near the buddhist site of Gumbat, there is a perennial spring of drinkable water, which waters a small local system of fields. Other springs, now dried or in the course of drying up, were observed in other points of the upper valley, at different elevations. The most favoured areas are located on the uppermost slopes (at Nar-i-band), on the eastern slopes above 1300 m asl, at the same elevation on the western side (at Dur-bandai). In the lower slopes water is scarce, and the women of the villages have to walk long distances to satisfy the daily requirements of their families. On the eastern (right) side, the crest of Sur-ghar divides the Kandak area from the valley of Najigram; the opposite ridge, formed by the mountains of Jaurbanda ghar and Ban-ghar, separates the valley from the parallel depression of Kotah. Elevations rise from the 900-1000 m asl of the Barikot hills to 2100 m asl at the opposite extremity. Here the Tarakai-kandao pass leads to the crest that, westwards, brings to the areas of Kotah, Morah, Cherat, Kafir-kot, Shah-kot (the passes leading towards Mardan). In some cases access was granted by ancient pathways artificially excavated in the base rock (Nazir Ahmad Khan et al. 1995: figs. 5-6). Moving eastward, one reaches the Najigram and Karakar areas, Ham and then Buner. Villages are few (5); at higher elevations one encounters few seasonal settlements, summer dwellings and pastures, traditionally used by transhumant Gujar families. Deforestation of the local mountain slopes is doubtless ancient, as attested by thick layers of colluvial gravels observed above the ruins of some of the buddhist buildings of the valley. Deforestation and the consequent erosion have dramatically increased in the last few decades. The attempts at reforestation by Government agencies and private landowners mainly employed allochthonous species such as eucalyptus and ailanthus, which are currently destroying the ecology of the valley, because although these trees grow fast and stabilize the ground, they also significantly reduce the available soil moisture and do not form a humus covering. Besides land and water, the valley has little to offer. The destruction of the forest (deodars and blue pines on the heights, hollyoaks on the southern slopes) has (3) Swat toponomy mainly includes Pashtu words with recurrent suffixes such as china (spring), kandao (pass), patai (field), sar (hill-top), ghar (mountain), khwar (stream), dherai (mound), ghwandai (hill), tangai (gorge), doghal (cave), gat and gata (stone). Non-Pashtu names are rare but interesting (for example 'Ham', see Olivieri 1996: n. 33). Sometimes topographical indications are used, like bar and kuz (above and below). Settlements have different toponyms, perhaps reflecting cultural affiliation alongside a particular type of location: for example kalai in Pashtu indicates a village, kot, kote and kotah a fortified settlement, bandai and band a summer pasturing site; but there are also Indian words like gram, or Arabic-Persian terms such as qala. The study we started for AMSV will necessarily include a toponomastic research of the whole Swat valley. [7] 127</page><page sequence="8">cancelled a basic resource of the traditional economy of the valley - timber exploitation. It has also destroyed the hunting grounds, instead of creating limited grazing grounds for buffalos and humped bulls. An additional, but very limited resource, that was soon abandoned, was the exploitation in recent times of veins of white quartzite as raw materials for glass and porcelain factories. We ignore how far white quartz was exploited in the past, on a more limited scale, for different purposes (for example, as a fire stone). In the past the valley was doubtless the seat of the extraction of rocks used for the production of grinding stones, building material and some minor craft industry (granite, micaschists, soapstone) (6). The Survey: Prehistoric and Protohistoric Evidence In Spring 1926 Sir Aurel Stein spent a few days in the village of Barikot, establishing a base camp for a series of surveys (Stein 1930). His first goal was a preliminary exploration of Kandak, where he visited two buddhist sacred areas at the mouth of the valley {ibid/. 12, pi. II). These sites, now badly damaged, are presently being studied by D. Faccenna. A. Stein also visited the major buddhist areas of Kanjar-kote and Gumbat {ibid.: 12, 14). Another exploration is due to E. Barger and Ph. Wright in 1938 (Barger &amp; Wright 1941). Limited excavations were carried out at Barikot, Gumbat and Kanjar-kote, and in two newly discovered buddhist sacred areas: Amluk and China-bara (both in upper Kandak). Finally, we remember the excavation trenches laid in the area of the prehistoric graveyard of Barikot, on the left bank of the valley mouth (Tusa 1981) and the topographic survey of the Barikot area, (including part of the Kandak) (Olivieri 2003). We have included all the sites that displayed any possible archaeological evidence of prehistoric or protohistoric occupation, or the sites that, although settled in later periods, were associated with rock carvings or rock artefacts. Obviously enough, we cannot confidently provide a protohistoric dating for our rock artefacts. We noted, for example, that cup-marks also accompany the periphery of the most important (6) In the past, inner Kandak was a marginal agricultural area compared with the richer silt fields cultivated in seasonal beds in Swat. Here rice and wheat are rotated with vegetables; land costs per kanal may be up to four times the Kandak plots. In the agricultural tradition of the region, the Kandak interior, at least up to Balah-kalai, was the property of just a few rich families of Barikot. The upper valley traditionally belonged to pre-Pashtun families called Gujar, who practised a mixed economy based upon agriculture and husbandry. In recent times, Gujars emigrated to the Gulf countries and returned with money to buy land and labour and to dig new wells, thus introducing rice cultivation in areas previously limited to less rewarding cultures. In this process they also occupied land traditionally belonging to the khans of Barikot. The traditional landmarks in stone were removed, and the conflicts are still bitter even today. The landowners of Barikot control the lower valley and some of the larger springs and wells, and a barrier in the main road prevents it from being asphalted. The cultural identity of the Kandak area continues to measure itself against the dominant economy of the Swat valley. 128 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Buddhist sacred areas, withouth meaningful relationships with the presence or absence of more ancient ceramics. Here, cup-marks are tendentially larger and often occur in lines or in isolation, although the true functional, symbolic or chronological implications of this possible difference are still a matter of debate. Even today, in the Kandak area, people are somehow conscious of the presence of cup-marks, and still make some use of tanks and other excavated features. Larger cup-marks sometimes may be seen filled with sand, perhaps used as an abrasive; tanks gather pieces of cloth, other artefacts used by children as toys, and carved or excavated surfaces may have been deliberately concealed under leaves or branches. Of the following sites, the Bang-doghal shelter, the large boulder of Kandak ford, Lekha-gata 1 and many other large carved slabs were documented by tracing (7). The pictures published herein show only a part of much larger corpus. This study will hopefully be part of specific research currently under way and the observations made in the present paper should be viewed as preliminary (Olivieri 2004; forthcoming a). List of Sites (Fig. 2) (8) The Protohistorical Graveyard of Barikot (Site 2) The graveyard (or one of the graveyards) of Barikot is located between the westernmost extension of the valley and the piedmont schists of Ghaka-kandao. In the past, two graves were excavated by the Italian Archaeological Mission (Tusa 1981). Grave 1, a cist-grave made with vertical stone slabs and covered with large, partially superimposed, horizontal slabs contained unconnected bone remains. Grave 2, with a south-east to north-west alignment, was similar; it consisted of the remnants of three individuals (two with scattered bones, and a third in anatomical connection). Furnishings included 38 vessels; the dating, on the basis of ceramic typology, is between the end of SCS Period VI and Period VII, i.e. between the 6th and the 4th centuries B.C. (Stacul 1987) (9). The graveyard seems to extend for at least 3 ha (1 km from north to south, at least 300 m from east to west). We do not (7) The site of Bang-doghal, discovered in 2000, was documented graphically during the 2004 campaign. (8) Even if the list refers to the Sites recorded during the 2000 Campaign, Fig. 2 will also include the 2004 data. The numbers refer to the AMSV inventory. When a toponym is followed by a number, it belongs to a cluster of Sites near the same general location. Toponyms in normal letters can be transcribed with a certain degree of confidence, because they are reported in pre-existing literature or on the cartographic GSP sources; conversely, toponyms partially in square brackets, report preliminary, hypothetic transcriptions. (9) Periods indicated with Roman numbers refer to the Swat prehistoric-protohistoric sequence (hereafter SCS, i.e. Swat Cultural Sequence) defined by G. Stacul on the basis of the Ghalegai rock shelter (Stacul 1987).

Almost completely covered by orchards and terraces directly and dug deep into the ground, the graveyard seems to have been extensively damaged and plundered by the local inhabitants. In March 2004 local villagers donated to our team an interesting copper vessel reportedly coming from this area. Gul[angaso]-dherai (Site 3) This site was located on the riverine terrace facing Goratai (see Site 6), on the present edge of the Kandak bed. About 10,000 cm of archaeological deposit were suddenly destroyed by a caterpillar in 2000 behind the stream escarpment, and only a narrow section now survives on the edge of the field. Gul[angaso]-dherai was a historical habitational site originally measuring about 100 x 60 m, with well-built houses and alleys or courtyards regularly paved with flat stones. Its demolition brought to light few possible specimens of protohistorical ceramics, suggesting an earlier occupation hardly visible on surface. Abwa 1 (Site 4) This site extends for about 150 x 100 m about 2 km from the beginning of the Kandak road, always on the western side of the valley. It is found under a system of wide agricultural terraces delimited on its periphery by large rocky outcrops. It is perhaps the largest habitational site of the Kandak area. Also in this case, the find of a few protohistorical sherds suggests that the site could have been settled in protohistorical times as well. Abwa 2 (Site 5) Moving upstream along the same banks, about 200 m south of Site 4, on the surface of the local agricultural terraces, you find a site marked by a wide scattering of pebbles and ceramics. Among the collected materials there is a painted potsherd comparable to similar specimens of SCS Period IV (see Stacul 1987: fig. 32); cortical flakes of black siltite shaped into discoidal scrapers, heavily worn (similar to scrapers dated to SCS Period IV at Barikot, see ibid.: figs. 37-38); a siltite tool having a subrectangular contour; chipped flakes in black siltite; hemispherical hammerstones in quartzite. Goratai-kandao (Site 6) Located 150 m south of the road that skirts the southern flank of the Barikot hill, this site is marked on the surface by a large cluster of pebbles, other stone items and a few ceramics. These objects are ploughed out from a series of pleistocenic gravelly terraces, themselves resting on a thick bank of compact silt. From a topographical viewpoint, the site is a low eroded hummock running alongside the [11] 131</page><page sequence="12">road for a maximum extension of about 30 x 30 m. Some large stone slabs visible on the surface beside recent trenches indicate the location of plundered protohistorical graves. During later visits in March 2004 we observed, in sections aside the fields, the remnants of some destroyed graves, and collected few vessels and potsherds from the destroyed furnishings. The ceramics may be preliminarily ascribed to the latest phases of the Swat graveyards. Other artefacts collected on surface include: a possible hand-axe, flaked pebbles and bifacial tools, few blades and retouched flakes, some bifacial choppers, cortical flakes, these latter all on black siltite. There are also some ground stone tools (in quartzite and basalt) that appear to have been re-cycled as cores for the detachment of flakes (10). Goratai-kandao 2 (Site 7) Another small cluster of artefacts on the same alluvial terrace, about 200 m south-west of the former; among the artefacts datable to historical times there is a siltite scraper datable to SCS Period IV. Tahsildar[seb-kafirai] (Site 8) This site was found on the right bank of the river, in front of Goratai, on a thick conoid made of layers of silt, alternating with erosive layers rich in pebbles and gravel. At an apparent height of 20-30 m from the alluvial plain, this conoid was bound by a large retaining wall, about 4 m high and 15 m long, running from north to south, datable to historical times, forming a monumental terrace. Immediately south, recent agricultural works unearthed the remains of a small protohistorical graveyard, perhaps 20 x 40 m. in size. The graves, in cross section, seem to be cists made of long, thin stone slabs. Sites with Rock Artefacts (Site-area 23) This label marks a wide area rich in rock-carvings and rock artefacts. The area occupies the 'inselberg' crest of Jaurbanda-ghar, between Kanjar-kote Balah-kalai (Site 44) and Gumbat. Kandak (Site 24) In the surroundings of the present village, both below the last houses to the north of the main core, and in the agricultural terraces facing the village on the opposite side of the river, we collected potsherds dating to SCS Periods IV, V-VII and to historical times. Some of the potsherds are rolled and worn, but others have (10) The choppers or chopping tools are comparable, in size, to the tools dated at Ghalegai to the SCS Period III (Stacul 1987: 48). For the time being, they may be considered as preceding SCS Period IV, i.e. ante the 18th century B.C. This find is relevant because these archaic-looking stone tools, in this context, are the first to have been identified outside Galeghai. The finding of bifacial stone tools with much earlier characteristics will be discussed by M. Vidale, in collaboration with R. Micheli, at the next SAA Conference, in July 2005 in London. 132 [12]</page><page sequence="13">relatively fresh fractures and may have been recently dug out of the ground. Immediately north of the village we observed some displaced stone slabs evidently coming from disturbed protohistorical graves; later, in March 2004, our informants brought us to a series of sections visible among the agricultural terraces where many graves made with heavy stone slabs were clearly recognizable. The protohistorical site included both a settlement and a large graveyard. Local villagers donated to the Mission few sherds and complete vessels preliminarily datable to SCS periods VI and VII. Below the village, on the left side of the river, we discovered a huge boulder studded with cup-marks on its flat top, while other cup-marks and sinuous grooves run along the side (Site 120). The cup-marked figuration on this complex megalithic monument might have figurative implications, as the authors shall discuss in a forthcoming paper. Gumbat (Site 25) On the surface of the historical settlement extending below the buddhist sacred area, the artefacts collected included potsherds in gray ware and a polished axe in a greenish stone dated to SCS Period IV (Fig. 3). Continuity of settlement might be explained by the presence of an important spring still active at the southern edge of the site, near a shelter that might still preserve archaeological deposits. South-west of Gumbat, a large promontory houses several rock shelters still used for shelter by shepherds and children. On the large stone slabs protecting and surrounding these shelters cup-marks and other carvings were observed. An isolated large slab is distinguished by the remnants of a complex figuration (see Sites 32, 35, 44); on another slab a carved rectangular tank was visible. Gumbat 1 (Site 26) Moving west, towards the top of the crest, one encounters a tangai winding downslope from the watershed. About 30 m upstream there is a spring whose water pours on to a flat stone slab showing cup-marks and interconnecting grooves (n). Ganderai (Site 27) The site rises on the top of a small promontory on the left bank of the river, about 400 m south of Kandak, below Kakai-kandao. Garam (Site 29) A large historical site, marked on the surface by many parallel agricultural terraces, sometimes corresponding to outcropping stone walls of the ancient settlement. Visible on the surface are abundant clusters of loose pebbles and ceramics. We also recovered a serpentine polished axe (Fig. 4), suggesting the possibility of a pre-existing protohistorical settlement. (n) In 2004 a second tank with cup-marks was documented (Gumbat 2, Site 118); it collected the water from another spring uphill from Site 26.

Kakai-kandao (Sites 30 and 121) In this area, on the Kotah watershed, we documented and reported two painted rock shelters, one just south of the Kakai-kandao (Site 30) and the other, Sargah-sar (Site 121), to the south, at the same height. Both are possibly datable to the Iron Age (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002: figs. 3 and 9) (12). Muhammad-patai (Site 31) Descending from the hill of Kakai-kandao besides the Kotah watershed, and walking for about 300 m towards the south-west, one reaches a large shelter covered by a projecting schist slab, and surrounded by a recently built stone slab. On the top (12) During the 2004 reconnaissance the documentation of the shelters already published were verified. In the case of Kakai-kandao further traces of anthropomorphic depictions were documented; it was also determined that there were various cup-marks both at the base and at the top. Since the painted shelters/cup-marks association was observed also at Sargah-sar, it must be recorded as recurrent and, in all probability also chronologically significant. In the important incised shelter of Lekha-gata (Site 84), the first phase of which was certainly contemporary with Gogdara I, rock carvings/cup-marks association was ultimately documented. To come back to the Sargah-sar shelter, new figurations must be recorded at the lower and right-hand edges of the painted niche: in particular, an anthropomorph with unnaturally outwardly extended arms and outstretched fingers. At the center of the niche, geometric ideograms have been documented, while another ideogram (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002: fig. 3), on closer scrutiny, was found to consist of a wheel formed by three dotted concentric circles with a bull's eye at the center. The similarity with the wheel of the slab Lekha-gata 1 (Site 97) (Fig. 41) is quite apparent. Lastly, at the base of the niche several light comb-like incisions were found (of the later type, according to Olivieri 2004), which respected the presence of the paintings in the shelter. 134 [14]</page><page sequence="15">of the upper slab a series of carvings were photographed, forming a complex frieze of at least five figures. Below the slab, lightly carved on the rock wall of the shelter at least ten zoomorphic figures in a rough linear comb-like style are visible. Kandak-dherai (Site 32) About 300 m south-east of the village of Kandak lies a promontory that forms a prominent landmark; a thick stone slab studded with many cup-marks and interconnecting grooves was found on its top. Torkamar-patai (Site 33) On the opposite side of the large tangai opening above Kandak, about 350 m above the promontory we just described, a tank was dug out of a gneiss boulder; the tank had a hole in the corner and a draining channel. At the same elevation, about 250 m northward, there were other boulders with cup-marks and another tank similar to the previous one. The associated ceramics belong to historical times, but some specimens might be dated to Period IV; here we found one of the very rare potsherds of polished gray ware encountered in the Kandak valley. Bang-doghal (Site 34) A large rock shelter on the left side of the middle Valley, on the left bank of a minor seasonal stream. We observed a complex of various rock carvings representing geometric designs, humans and animals. Moving upwards, along the bed of the same stream, we found a second site (Bang-doghal 1; Site 122) with a possible geometrical carving. Jowar-[jabagai] (Site 35) On the top of an isolated promontory between two minor converging streams, a few hundred m north-west of Balah-kalai (Site 44), the whiteness of a quartzite cave, the largest of the valley, stands out. This mine might have been exploited in ancient times (see the materials from the nearby Site 5). Further upward, about 40 m west, there is another promontory forming a highly visible landmark. On the top, a series of sub-horizontal stone slabs form a natural horseshoe-shaped arc (25 x 25 m). These slabs are covered with cup-marks. At center there are two isolated boulders or large slabs also studded with cup-marks and interconnecting grooves. The most visible pattern, in one of these central stones, clearly represents an animal figure. Amluk (Site 36) Amluk is one of the largest buddhist monumental sacred areas of the Kandak area. The rocky substrata outcropping on the plateau, at the edge of the buddhist sacred area, house a series of well excavated tanks and holes. Dwolasmane-patai (Site 38) A painted rock shelter dated to the Iron Age (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002: 16, fig. 11). Nearby, we recorded the presence of slabs and boulders with cup-marks and excavated tanks. [15] 135</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 5 - Jaur-bandai (Site 40): tomb slab with cup? mark. (Photo by L.M.O.) Jaur-bandai (Site 40) A relatively large settlement (about 200 x 200 m), built on a plateau-like formation at a medium elevation, in the center of the left side of the valley. The ceramics are datable to a great extent to Kushana, late Kushana and Hindu Shahi periods, include jars with a carinated neck, jars with narrow necks and applied ridges (painted black), dishes with sand coated bottom {ibid.: fig. 33), truncated conical bowls, and peculiar pedestalled bowls painted black on a red slip. Because of its extension and dominant position, Jaur-bandai could have been the leading center of the middle valley in early historic times. To an earlier phase is datable a small completely plundered, protohistorical graveyard, identified about 100 m downhill from the settlement area in the center of a small natural depression. One of the displaced stone slabs of the graves showed a single cup-mark in the center (Fig. 5) (13). Balah-kalai (Site 44) Above the village area we found a promontory where a series of large stone slabs display carvings in the form of wheels traced with series of dots. Kakai-kandao 3 (Site 47) A small rock shelter on the western side of the western watershed. On the rock wall, darkened by the chemical alteration of the rock face, an isolated carving may be observed. Kakai-kandao 4 (Site 48) About 60 m north-east, above Kakai-kandao 3, one sees a wide natural cavity, characterized by light carvings, covered by heavy patinas and very hard to recognize. (13) This site was again visited in 2004. Downhill from the protohistoric graveyard (Jaur-banda sar; Site 96) some interesting boulders with cup-marks were documented, two in particular: in one, regular lines of cup-marks were observed; the other displayed a cup-mark with groove, which seems to be part of an anthropomorphic figuration (Figs. 39-40). 136 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Jaur-bandai 2 (Site 49) In front of Kandak, in the midst of the slope, north-west of Site 40 there is a vertical stone wall below a projecting slab, carved with poorly preserved animal figures in linear style. Jawan-kote (Site 52) The small buddhist sacred area of Jawan-kote was built at an elevation of about 1300 m asl on top of a steep rock formation. To the west of the site boulders and slabs with carved cup-marks may be observed. Dheri (Site 57) A habitation site dated to historical times. Along the pathway leading from Dheri to Nar-i-band we noted a boulder with rounded cavities most probably formed by the sharpening of stone and metallic axes and cup-marks. Dwolasmanai-patai 1 (Site 59) North of Site 38, we recorded what was left of a protohistoric graveyard, partially plundered, occupying an area of about 70 x 50 m. Nashtar-patai (Site 62) North of Site 32 there is a stone slab with carved designs, clustering around an irregular circular feature. In the surroundings we recorded the presence of protohistorical ceramics. Kandak Ford (Site 120) Downhill from the village of Kandak, near a path rising from the ford in the Kandak stream, a large boulder completed covered in cup-marks and grooves was encountered (14). (14) In 2004, in the area around this boulder, other boulders with cup-marks and basins were documented. On one of them obvious traces of wear due to the sharpening of stone and metal tools were found. To conclude the Site List, mention must be made of several new sites discovered in 2004, in particular: in Kandak, Miage (Sites 107-109) (protohistoric graveyard, cup-marks, 'palettes' and tanks); on the slopes of Kotah, Tope (Site 78) (incised boulder), Lekha-gata (Site 84) (shelter with incisions and cup-marks) and Lekha-gata 1 (large horizontal slab with sub-figurative dot-technique compositions). Numerous cup-mark sites were found also in the Najigram valley. All the new finds will be presented by L.M. Olivieri and M. Vidale at the next SAA Conference to be held in 2005 in London.

An Analysis of Rock-carvings and Other Rock Artefacts (15) Wheel-like and Linear Designs Made with a Dot-technique (Figs. 6-11) These designs are mostly circular, or semi-circular, and are traced with sequences of dot-marks. These circles most often contain crosses incised with the same technique. Inner crosses are consistently oriented towards the cardinal points; the wheels' have average diameters of 40-50 cm, although we recorded some circles measuring no more than 20 cm. In a single case the cross is included in two concentric circles. A larger carving recorded south of Dur-bandai showed a cluster of five 'wheels' joined and partially superimposed in two lines. In three cases 'wheels' were observed together with cup-marks. In one case, we recorded a cup mark imperfectly inserted into a 'wheel' and thus we hypothesized, admittedly on a doubtful basis, that it had been carved earlier (Fig. 6). In two cases, in Site-area 23, we have 'wheels' carved on boulders or slabs with cup-marks (Figs. 7-8). After a All the photographs are by M.

Promontory between Gumbat and Kanjar-kote (Site 23) (scale as Fig. 12). preliminary inspection, these two cases, as well, would support the relative chronology attested by the first example. More rarely, a similar dot technique was used to execute linear and curved designs of uncertain interpreation (Fig. 9) (16). At the site of Lekha-gata 1 (Site 97) we find the simultaneous presence of wheels and (16) In this same region, other examples of wheels included inner crosses. Crossed wheels were reported in Bajaur (site of Ragai, in the Salarzai tahsil - in Saeed-Ur-Rehman 1996: 157, fig. 53). Here the colleagues of the Dept. of Archaeology and Museums of Pakistan found a large boulder with 5 wheels, one of which sub-circular and rather similar to our examples. Near this boulder there was a protohistoric graveyard. The orientation of the inner crosses is not mentioned. Crosses drafted with dots, similar to our specimens in Figs. 8 and 9, were reported from the Upper Indus region. The site of Hodar shows two examples absolutely identical to the Kandak ones (35:16, 35:60 in MANP 3: pi. 72). See also a meaningful comparison with two crossed wheels carved and outlined and/or filled using a similar technique (in MANP 3: pi. 68: 3:2, 4:26; pi. 69: 4:34, but also 4:56, 4:58, 11:7, pi. 71: 26:125; pi. 74: 86:7, 87:4, but also 90:8, 91:1, 91:2, 99:1, 110:21). Linear designs using a dot-like technique are less common in the Upper Indus (MANP 3: pi. 68: 75:9; pi. 69: 4:34), but are common patterns formed by cup-marks (MANP 3: pi. 74: 4:51, 106:23, 106:24, 106:25). In only a few instances are such ideograms combined with other figures to form patterns having a syntactic value. More commonly, wheels are associated in series (MANP 3: gr. 4:A, 4:B, 4:C) and this evidence allows one to exclude any connection in the Upper Indus (at least preliminarily), because the wheels aligned in series bear crosses with diverging orientation. Finally, note that a crossed wheel appears at Gogdara I in a 'mature' context of carving (Olivieri 1998: 73, fig. 17, no. 97). This wheel recalls the copper disk found at Katelai in the grave goods of Period VII (Silvi Antonini &amp; Stacul 1972: fig. 27&lt;?, pi. LXlb-c).

Promontory between Gumbat and Kanjar-kote (Site 23) (scale as Fig. 12). more complex dot-technique patterns (Figs. 10-11, 41). The wheels' orientation according to the cardinal points suggests that they might have been traced following axial conceptions underlying some rituals, but this would not immediately explain their redundancy on the same boulders. They might also express ideograms such as the 'sun', possibly - as we have seen - after the cup-mark complexes - as a facet of a sun-centered cult documented in Karakorum that lasted until historical times. Boulders and Stone Slabs with Cup-marks, Interconnecting Tracks and/or Trickle-like Grooves (Figs. 12-23) It is well known that cup-marks are medium-small sized hemispherical or conical cavities. Usually cup-marks appear to have been made by means of tools exerting a rotatory friction on stone flat, smooth surfaces. In Site 32 a thick slab covered by cup-marks was cracked by a large fissure, and in the break we collected a triangular flake in white quartzite whose edges, possibly worn by use, might have been used in the making of cup-marks. Slabs with cup-marks and interconnecting grooves (see 140 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 9 - Linear marks using clotting technique; one line is straight, the other curved. Promontory between Gumbat and Kanjar-kote (Site 23). below) may be true megaliths, and are unlikely to have been moved from their original locations; but the smaller specimens, in some cases, might have been displaced, sliding downhill (17). Interconnecting grooves are short or long tracks or furrows with a semi-circular section dug out to different depths and widths in order to connect part of the cup marks on the same wide stone surfaces. Some tracks simply depart from cup-marks, as though to drain downwards liquids. In some stone artefacts, cup-marks and tracks form complex, crowded networks. In general, one has the impression that such tracks had not been made in a completely random fashion; in some cases they clearly connect the largest, most visible cup-marks, creating some kind of visual focuses in the overall network or composition. Trickle-like grooves are relatively large, sinuous tracks that move from the flat top of some prominent rocks or boulders and slope downwards on their flanks, sometimes vertically. They usually do not occur on flat slabs. In some cases, particularly in our Site 24, at the end of these trickles we recorded large and shallow (17) Similar finds are reported from Kumaon (Joshi Maheshwar 1985-86: 27).

A first observation is that this type of incision, as a rule, is heavily washed out and worn: they look ancient, particularly if compared to modern carvings, that in other sites, represent motor carts and wagons. A second generalization refers to their location. These three types of artefacts were often found on boulders or large sub-horizontal slabs occupying the top of promontories or crests, where they stood out as highly visible landmarks (Site 23: but this feature or function, before the extensive deforestation of the Kandak slopes, is uncertain). Large stones with cup-marks are also visible beside narrow mountain paths, natural accesses or natural fords near the present-day villages. As a slab with cup-marks and tanks is visible below the summit of Barikot, on the western terrace (Olivieri 2003: 48, pi. XXXVIILz), it might mark the end of the ancient path or route on the upper slopes of the Kandak towards its regional capital. A third general point is that, although trickle-like grooves are rare, they were found with cup-marks, although in the absence of small interconnected canals. At any rate, in Sites 26 and 118 stones with cup-marks were found in the bed of a smaller stream, and near two springs (Fig. 18). In the springs cup-marks provided with interconnecting grooves are visible immediately below the outlet: water flows onto the flat surface of the rock and even today fills grooves and cup-marks. Site 26 was located within a low gorge, watered by a khwar fed by both springs. The first spring is endowed with a quadrangular tank (c. 60 x 60 x 35 cm) dug out of the bedrock; at the bottom there is a round cavity. The tank is filled through a small canal crossing another basin-like cavity. The water is then drained by a network of grooves, cup-marks and smaller basin-like depressions. While the larger cup-marks or basins might possibly have been used for collecting water, this is obviously not the case for the smaller ones; but in general this evidence supports the possibility that also in other instances grooves and cup-marks could have been carved in order to direct and collect rainfall. A second spring shows a much larger tank-well, dating to historical times with constructed stone walls that is accessible by means of steps. Further upstream we found a third spring associated with boulders carved with cup-marks. Perhaps this area of the valley was frequented for its water before the erection of the nearby buddhist sacred area of Gumbat. Cup-marks may be isolated or cluster in complex associations having more than 100 cup-marks and several interconnecting grooves. These stones are always deeply worn, and we observed many instances of cup-marks in various stages of erosion, often reduced to faint, almost imperceptible depressions. As a consequence, the surviving carvings should probably be considered only a part of more complex, vanished patterns. We have the impression (admittedly hard to substantiate) that many carvings have recurring patterns, with one or two larger cup-marks and a peripheral constellation of smaller ones. Interconnecting grooves and other linear tracks are usually more common around the central cups than in other parts of the same monuments. 146 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 17 - Partial view of the Kandak ford boulder (Site 120, Fig. 12). Fig. 18 - Gumbat sources (Site 26). [27] 147</page><page sequence="28">A large slab in Site 23 (Fig. 15), heavily weathered on surface, is broken at one end corresponding to a line of small cup-marks. As in this slab the larger cup-marks are absent, we might conjecture that one of these large cup-marks was located in the missing part. In this case, this slab might have had an anthropomorphic meaning, the large cup-marks indicating the head. In the center of the same slab, small cup marks are connected by the remnants of thin grooves (the 'hands'?), and inside the space so defined we see a small, almost invisible carving of an axe provided with a flat blade transversally mounted on a straight handle (Figs. 19-20). The carving is very schematic; nonetheless the axe seems to be a metallic one: looking for possible comparisons, one notes a lack of similarity with both the long and thin Indus copper axes of the 3rd millennium B.C. and the well-designed, curvilinear axe blades frequently carved in the historical carvings of the Upper Indus. Instead, short broad blades of this type resemble weapons of the 2nd millennium B.C. such as the axes of Ahar or many specimens of the so-called 'Copper Hoards' cultures. In any case, this axe design is a one-off specimen and we should not overload it with chronological implications. In a badly weathered slab of Site 25, two lines of cup-marks are flanked by a complex path of sinuous grooves, almost completely abraded by erosion. One or more lines of small cup-marks were also observed in the stone of Site 32, corresponding to highly visible, dominant landmarks. Site 35, Jawarjabagai, resembles a major cultual setting: it is formed by a horseshoe-like formation of boulders (probably natural) intensively carved with cup-marks and grooves, opening towards the south-west (Fig. 21); in the two boulders visible right in the center, cup-marks and grooves have been combined, beyond any possible doubt, in order to represent an animal and, less indisputably, a phallic symbol (Fig. 22). Another type of carved monument, attested in a single case and found in situ, is a kind of 'menhir' with cup-marks recorded near Site 57 (18). (18) In the Kandak valley alone we observed more than 50 cases of stone surfaces with cup-marks. In the past, other cases were noted but not documented (with the exception of the Chirgai-gat case in Olivieri 2002, see n. 15). Carved grooves and cup-marks were photographed in front of a surface with tanks and cup-marks near the sacred Buddhist area of Amluk-dara, in the Karakar valley, as well as at Nimogram and Swegalai (Di Florio et al. 1993: 67, fig. 5) (Fig. 23). Such artefacts were never the subject of specific attention, and, in the past, we believe that hundreds of carvings escaped our attention: in September 2002 L.M.O. took a picture of a boulder with cup-marks near Kalako-dherai, in the Jambil valley (an area he had previously visited on many occasions); during the 2004 survey, the site of Manyar yielded several isolated cup-marks and, in permutations, associated with a late Buddhist settlement (Filigenzi, forthcoming). Outside Swat, in the same region, cup-marked boulders have not been reported, presumably for similar reasons. Only in Baluchistan, at Tor-derai, rows of dot-marks are reported as forming some kind of figuration (Mian Said Qamar 1974-1986: 175, pi. LIII?). The site of Tor-derai has revealed some matches with the so-called 'cairn burial sites' widely spread across the Iranian plateau from Fars to Samangan, up to Karakorum and Kashmir (Lamberg-Karlovsky &amp; Humphries 1968: fig. 3). Other examples of dot-marked lines together with carvings, cut, in turn, by cup-marks were reported from Afghan Sistan during a survey carried out in 1966 in the Helmand valley (Hammond 1970: figs. 19-25). In the Upper Indus area cup-marks are absent or rare; rows of dot-marks are more frequent. Many examples come from the Himalayas, in Kumaon (see below). 148 [28]</page><page sequence="29">[29] 149</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 21 - Detail of Fig. 22: top, note the schematic zoomorphic figuration; below: a phallus?

Rock Shelters and Walls Bearing Figurative Linear Designs (Figs. 24-31) In the surveyed part of the Kandak valley, linear rock carvings were observed at a few rock shelters and on some isolated faces of large boulders and, more rarely, on isolated rocks. Muhammad-patai (Site 31) is a shelter protected by a huge, thick projecting rock, and bound by a recent dry stone enclosure. As stated above, on the vertical front of the upper projecting slab a series of lightly carved designs are visible. This frieze rises about 3.50 m high from the shelter's floor. From left to right it is possible to identify a feline (looking right), attacking a herbivore with the head lowered in a defensive posture; then follows another animal, two possible human figures and a larger anthropomorph with a trapeze-shaped body and a round head. This figure raises a round shield and a possible weapon (Fig. 24) (19). In the space or room below this slab, the rear wall is covered by rows of very crude, comb-like linear depictions of domestic animals (Fig. 25). (19) In the art of protohistoric Swat there are several instances of figures of predators attacking ruminants: the oldest example is the fragment BKG dated to Period IV (together with BKG 650, 651, 1057, less clear) (Stacul 1987: fig. 46). The rock painting of Sargah-sar (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002) was preliminary dated to the end of the protohistorical Period. [31] 151</page><page sequence="32">Fig. 25 - Muhammad-patai: shelter with comb-like incisions (Site 31), rear wall. More numerous and complex are the carvings found at Bang-doghal, a 4 to 5 m high cliff bank vertically split by large fissures on the left of a gorge in the center of the left slope of the valley (Site 34) (Fig. 26). The state of conservation of the carvings is very poor, but the heavily darkened surface of the rock conceals a large number of faint incisions. In some sectors, the incisions appear to have been defaced in ancient times, and immediately after the visit of our team, for some reason somebody took the trouble to further damage the designs by scratching the rock wall with stones. Nonetheless, in this shelter, even without a careful inspection or systematic contact tracing, we observed the figures briefly described below (preliminarily denoted, according to their setting, as Sectors I-III). Sector I: the outlines of two animals, with lowered heads and curved horns, are deeply carved and partially superimposed on one another (Fig. 27). In Sector II, to the right of Sector I, other ancient carvings are faint, covered with a heavy dark patina, and more irregularly traced. Several figurations of warriors and horsemen surrounding a possible stupa figure (all poorly carved in linear, comb-shaped designs, the typical style of the later carvings according to Olivieri, forthcoming a). In Sector III, in the uppermost part of the shelter, on the left one sees a large figure of a bowman shooting an arrow while riding a horse (Fig. 28). This figure, unlike those in the lower Sectors, seems to have been lightly hammered onto the oxidised patina, so that the figure appears as a light-coloured contour against a dark 152 [32]</page><page sequence="33">Fig. 27 - Bang-doghal: shelter with incisions (Site 34), Sect.

To the right other designs are visible: three anthropomorphic designs (one having legs shaped like a inverted 'U' and the indication of the penis); and five animal figures traced with the recurrent late comb-like features. Nearby, another cliff shows a geometric design. Another small rock shelter in the same area, Kakai-kandao 3 (Site 47) displays a single carving, executed with the same technique and the same style as the bowman rider of Sector III in Bang-doghal, showing a man with outstretched arms riding a quadruped. On the top of these rocks poorly preserved, washed off geometrical carvings were observed. The site of Kakai-kandao 4 (Site 48), too, shows more faint carvings damaged by erosion, but covered with an ancient oxidized patina. One represents a human figure with lowered arms and an indication of the penis. On the right and left we observed other unintelligible designs (the whole surface bearing carved figures measures no more than 70 x 30 cm). The site of Jaur-bandai 2 (Site 49) displays a few badly preserved animal figures on an exposed rock wall. Lastly, mention should be made of the find made in 2004 of an important incised shelter at Lekha-gata (Site 84). It contains late comb-like graffiti in a very poor state of conservation over the shallow depth beside figures with a heavier patina depicting bi-triangular shaped animals (including a large ibex) and a light 154 [34]</page><page sequence="35">Fig. 29 - Lekha-gata: detail of cart (scale 1:6). two-wheeled cart drawn by a pair of equids (Figs. 29-30) (20). It also includes a pecked or hammered picture of a humped bull, a comparatively rare find in the Kandak rock art repertory. (20) At present, the oldest complexes in the region seem to be Gogdara I and Lekha-gata, both datable to the late Bronze Age (according to the sequence established in Olivieri 1998 and forthcoming a). Sector I at Bang-doghal, where the designs are carved in depth, together with other examples from Hathiano-kandao and Bajaur sites, may be dated to the same horizon. Linear designs (with the variant of the patterns depicted with a comb-like style) were made by friction and light hammering; very often the designs are actually graffiti. Examples of this second style (dated, in the sequence of Gogdara I, to the Iron age and later, until historical times) are well documented in the site of Hathiano-kandao (Nazir Ahmad Khan 1983); we may also add the site of Kashmir-smast near Sanghao, whose graffiti have been known since the 'Sixties (the most recent publication on this site appears in Tusa 1986), the graffiti and carvings of Ghariala and Mandori, near Attock, reported since the 'Forties, and the Chitral sites reported in Desio 1985. A good example of the comb-like style comes from a site west of the Kandak valley, near Allahdhan-dheri (Muhammad Bahadur Khan et al. 1999; Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002) (Fig. 31). Linear figures were recently discovered in Bajaur, at Khara Kamangar, in the Nawagai tahsil and in the site of Ilam-sar I, Salarzai tahsil (Saeed-Ur-Rehman 1996: 147, fig. 34; 153, figs. 47-48). Finally, mention should be made of the find in the Kandak valley, areal Site 23, near Dur-bandai of a set of curious geometric carvings: some may well be recent, because they appear alongside carvings reproducing carts with the wheels in profile and designs obviously depicting vans, tracks and buses.

Tanks and Basins Excavated in the Rock These features are well known because they have frequently been reported in rock-art contexts that apparently share many features with the Kandak or Kumaon valleys, namely (in spite of their geographic remoteness) the central and western Alps. In the Kandak survey we encountered rectangular or square tanks of medium large size, sometimes together with round basins and large cup-marks, excavated in large slabs or boulders of gneiss (Fig. 32). Usually such features are found near the most important buddhist sacred areas, or at the edges, but never inside their premises. Tanks have been found as isolated features (Sites 25 and 33), in series or lines (e.g. Site 36). A different feature, encountered in a single case (neglecting a doubtful case from Jabba, Kalako-dherai, Jambil, interpreted as a possible Vine press' - a hypothesis whose validity is currently being tested by L. Costantini) is a quadrangular carving with connected deep draining grooves: this artefact is identical 156 [36]</page><page sequence="37">to the carved features that in the Alps B^'^^^^^^y^^ r" ???'"T^l^p are commonly defined as 'palettes' (Site m/^mf^SM^^i^ $r 40 and 106 - Manzare-tangai, above ^^^g^ Outcropping Boulders Intensively Worn by Sharpening Stone and Metallic Axes (Axe Sharpeners) We recorded three examples of these peculiar artefacts. On the slopes above Dheri (Site 51) there is a boulder with a large central cup-mark and traces left by the intensive shaping or sharpening of axe-like tools. Such wear traces have an inner (21) As far as the so-called Vine-presses' are concerned, mention should be made of the find made near Miage of two large basins connected to a canal system (collection and/or run-off) similar to that of Jabba (Sites 107 and 108). Indeed these seem actually to be tools suitable for the collection or decanting or flotation of pressed juices (Figs. 33-34). Tanks excavated in gneiss rocks are well known in many areas of Swat. They appear at medium to high elevations near old springs or Buddhist sacred complexes. We have already mentioned the site of Amluk-dara (Fig. 23); near the sacred area of Marano-tangai (south-eastern flank of the Morah-sar) there are two similar tanks associated with cup marks (Olivieri in Nazir Ahmad Khan et al. 1995: 338-41, fig. 15). One relevant find is that of one of these tanks on the top of the ancient sacred mountain of Swat, Mount Ham (Saeed-Ur-Rahman et al. 1996: 30, fig. 37). The tank is excavated in the local granitic gneiss, and in the Hindu traditions represents Ram-takht ('The Throne of Rama'); the rain water gathered in this tank is used for ritual bathings by the visitors who climb the mountain for the Amarakunda pilgrimage. At the base of the tank there is a large pool, built with rock masonry, dating to the historical period, probably having the same function. The Pashtun name of Mount Ilam is Joghiano-sar (The Mountain Top of the Yogin'). Near the buddhist hermitage shelters one can frequently see similar tanks, for example at the site of Ranigat, Mardan District). As far as the 'palette' of Jaur-bandai is concerned, we found an identical specimen at Monteviasco (Lombardy, Northern Italy) (Buffoni &amp; Zuccato 1999: fig. 21.4); there is another similar rock artefact at Mount Bego, in the western Alps region (Amirante &amp; Vatteone 1980: no. 219).

More detailed inspections and recording in the future should enable us to distinguish more clearly between the grooves left by copper-bronze tools-weapons and iron ones. As a matter of fact, such artefacts show a long sequence of axe maintenance (and possibly manufacture) that goes back to protohistory. The sharpening grooves left by metal specimens cut through pre-existing, large concave depressions compatible with the movements required by the shaping and sharpening of the stone axes in serpentine, granite and other rocks used in Swat at least from SCS Period IV. Another rock with the same marks was observed near Ghar-patai (Fig. 35) (22). In both cases, the boulders rise at (22) Besides the classes so far described, we recall the presence of large semi-dressed stone monoliths (whose extraction might have represented one of the economically relevant activities of ancient Kandak, thanks to the presence of thick local outcrops of gneiss and granites) (Fig. 36). These artefacts are also recurrent in the nearby areas, such as north-eastern Buner, where alongside the extraction and dressing of monoliths a pseudoisodomic megalithic construction technique developed 158 [38]</page><page sequence="39">Fig. 35 - Ghar-patai: axe-sharpener. the side of important pathways, and we may assume that passers-by simply used to stop on the way and fix their tools or weapons on the spot. The third example was documented in 2004 in Site 44. Preliminary Observations The typology of the rock artefacts of the Kandak valley is very heterogeneous and most likely reflects quite a variable chronology. While axe sharpeners might reveal an inner 'stratigraphy' - although obviously limited to negative interfaces - (sites of Tarike and Brah; south-eastern flank of Mount Ham) (Saeed-Ur-Rehman et al. 1996: figs. 28-30) (Fig. 37). In the past, Stacul remarked on the presence of a menhir in this area (Stacul 1967: 221); recently a stone-ring was also found in the same area (Pir Baba, site of Nandimulah-patai; see Saeed Ur-Rehman et al. 1996: 37). A similar rock-extracting and dressing skill is encountered in the areas of Mardan and Swabi, up to the Islamic period (see for example the semata or marking stones in the graveyards). The same tradition goes back to the historic, pre-Islamic period, as demonstrated by the impressive stone-ring of Asota (Fig. 38). We may also add the site of Turlandi, the location of another stone-ring (Shah Nazar Khan 1995: 114, pis. XVIk, XVIII?; Ihsan Ali 2003: 72-73, figs. 22-23) and Adina (Swabi) (Shah Nazar Khan 1993).

(Photo by L.M.O.). 160 [40]</page><page sequence="41">Fig. 38 - The stone-ring of Asota (Mardan). (Photo by L.M.O.). for the other types, as we shall see, we have no direct evidence. Few elements (admittedly a weak inferential basis) allowed us to place in a preliminary frame of relative chronology three of the above-described types of rock-artefacts: wheel-like designs, cup-marks and tanks. We have also attempted to relate this relative chronology to the boulders showing axe-sharpening marks, as well as to provide a preliminary hypothesis of a wider chronological reconstruction. The undisputable evidence of the manufacturing (by polishing) or maintenance (by sharpening) of stone axes in the same contexts marks obviously push back to the 2nd millennium B.C. the early application of these and possibly other technologies and figurative practices on rock; however, it also points to a case of uninterrupted and intensive modification of the same rock surfaces, leading to a particularly complex and ambiguous final archaeological record. Since cup-mark carvings were visible near these complex artefacts, the time-span of their use (although loosely defined in this way) might include also this form of figuration. Another important point is that similar artefacts are currently being observed and documented in similar mountain areas, roughly belonging to the same orographic phases of formation (Alps and Himalayas) (23). The observed similarities might be the result of convergent behavioural patterns of groups having the same mixed agricultural pastoral economy in mountain and piedmont areas, and moving for similar reasons across landscapes dominated by the outcrop of rocks with the same gross features. On the other hand, one would like to have a deeper understanding of the less functional and probably more openly symbolic implications of part of these artefacts in order to shed light on one of the more controversial phases of the cultural evolution of the Subcontinent. (23) For the Alps we refer in particular to the summaries in Seglie et al. 1987 and Buffoni &amp; Zuccato 1999. [41] 161</page><page sequence="42">Relative Chronology In the first place, it seems that both the tanks observed in Amluk-dara and the cup-marks carved onto the local tourmaline-leucogranite slabs were dug with steel or iron chisels, and therefore must be dated to a historical period (24) (Di Florio et al. 1993: 67). The function of these tanks is a moot question: in theory, they might have been used for collecting water, for animals and people, for preparing special beverages or for dyeing cloth. The quoted paper also suggested that such tanks were used in some kind of manufacturing activity performed in the Buddhist sacred areas. While we cannot exclude such a possibility, we note that the tanks found in the excavated complexes of Butkara I (Faccenna 1980: fig. 229, pis. 272b and 273) and Saidu Sharif I (Faccenna 1996: pis. 114-115; see ibid:. 128, n. 1, where the author gives a random list of these structures in other Buddhist sacred areas), evidently used for preparing and mixing stucco and plaster, are structurally different (they are often built as cists made of slabs, and they may retain coatings of stucco, generally absent in the tanks carved out of the bedrock). The most distinctive feature is that the carved tanks always appear along the periphery of the sacred areas (Olivieri, forthcoming b). On the Ram-takth, on the top of Mount Ham, the same tanks were considered part of a pre-buddhist, cultual apparatus. Perhaps the recurrent association of these rock-cut artefacts with the Buddhist sacred complexes is due to the fact that the monastic communities often re-occupied and restructured pre-existing sacred areas, making them sacred again, as ascertained in the cases of the protohistorical graveyards and some megalithic sites (25). The cup-marks found near the tanks, or excavated at the bottom of them (see Site 23), made with metallic tools, such as those at Amluk-dara and Swegalai (Di Florio et al. 1993: 71, fig. 12) (26) may attest to a set of traditions that endured until historical times. According to the concise definition given by R.G. Bednarik, cup-marks should be consideres as the 'oldest surviving rock art' (Bednarik 2002). Eurasiatic cup marks, in general, have been dated most commonly from protohistoric times (in the (24) Similar tanks are reported in Kumaon (Uttar Pradesh) (Mathpal 1995: pi. 60b). (23) For example at Amaravati, Yeleswaram, Nagarjunakonda there are instances of superimposition with megalithic cemeteries (Shopen 1995: 219-22). Other examples come from Swat at Butkara II, Katelai, Saidu Sharif I (Silvi Antonini 1963: 16; Tucci 1963: 27; Faccenna 1964: 62; Macchiarelli, Noci &amp; Faccenna 1997; Shopen 1995: 223, 229). Generally there is an interesting match between the architecture of s tup as and the structure of megaliths, as well as between the types of deposits found in both kinds of structures: see the revealing remarks in the studies of Shopen (1995: 229-35). Similar historical superimpositions, regularly involving sites with cup-marks, are well known in Europe as well (ibid/. 236-37). (26) At Swegalai (a site where soapstone, chloritoschists and talcoschists were extracted) bowl shaped pits with a depression for a covering slab were found, perhaps used as water tanks (Di Florio et al. 1993: figs. 7-8), to be compared with identical pits in Kumaon (sites of Jaskot and Bagwali Pokhar; see Mathpal 1995: 66, fig. 56a-b) in association, once more, with cup-marks. 162 [42]</page><page sequence="43">context of megalithic cultures as well) to the historical period (but according to few authors, in Europe figuration complexes with dots and lines might go back in time to late paleolithic times). Cup-marks are very common in the Alpine valleys and along their piedmont strips; their proposed chronology ranges from the times of megalithic art (late Neolithic to the Copper age) down to medieval times. Some sites in the Western Alps have cup-marks on cist graveyards, dating to the early Copper age, about 3000 B.C. (Mezzena 1997; Mezzena &amp; Morandi 1992). The Rupe Magna di Grosio (Lombardy, Italy) shows the stratigraphic superimposition of cup-marks on pre-existing figurative rock carvings. In 39 different cases, cup-marks turn out to cut across more ancient anthropomorphs, meander-like and snake-like designs, rectangles, concentric arcs, schematic designs of horses. The latter carvings have been dated from the Copper Age to the early Iron Age (around the 10th-9th centuries B.C.). Cup marks are later, and therefore in this case they might be confidently dated to the middle-late phases of the Iron Age, i.e. from the early Iron Age to the Roman period. [...] Such an hypothesis is supported by the occurrence, in the Alps region, of shallow cup-marks having hemispherical or conical shape, probably carved by the means of a stone tool, alongside larger and later cup-marks with sharper sections, carved with metallic tools, associated with grooves distinguished by rectangular sections. Possibly, in time, the carved rock surfaces developed more and more complex patterns. (Area 2002: 4, translated by the authors). Examples of cup-mark complexes are found in Central Asia, in Oceania and, more rarely, even in the New World; they are common in the Arabian peninsula, in the Near East, in the central and northern regions of the African continent, where this graphic expression belongs to cultures of 'evolved hunters' and societies with mixed economies up to late protohistoric times. In the Indo-Pakistani Subcontinent, cup-marks are frequently reported at the foot and in the major valleys of the Hindukush and Himalayan belts, and they too have been variously dated. A site with 498 cup-marks was reported at Daraki-chattan, in the Chambal Valley (India), to be somehow dated as 'palaeolithic' (Kumar 1996). Only in very rare instances do cup-marks occur in datable contexts. For example, in our Site 40, a small protohistorical graveyard, a slab originally placed as a grave cover had a single central cup-mark (27). The inner surface of most of these (27) A close match may be established with the covering slab of a cremation burial of the Golasecca culture (Iron Age) found near Varese (Lombardy, northern Italy). The slab shows carvings in the form of foot-prints and cup-marks; also the stone slab on the bottom of the cist-like construction shows cup-marks (Buffoni &amp; Zuccato 1999: 109-10, fig. 28.2, 4; for other comparisons see ibid.: 21, n. 5). The meaning of these rock artefacts, in such contexts, is not clear: they might have had a practical-cultual function, perhaps related to ritual offering. Such a function seems to have survived both in the Alpine regions, in medieval Christian cultual locations (for example, where the cup-marks were used as holes for the collection of money offered to the church) and in the Karakorum-Himalaya piedmont, in Buddhist sacred areas. [43] 163</page><page sequence="44">artefacts is, as a rule, badly worn by weathering, but it is probable that the larger cup-marks near the historical sites were carved using iron tools, while the regular and symmetric section of most of the smaller cup-marks, observed in other contexts, were the result of friction and rotation of quartz flakes. Thus, at present, a reasonable guess for dating these rock marks falls between SCS Period V (first half of the 1st millennium B.C.) and the historical phases. Judging on the basis of Site 23, where a wheel-like design made with a sequence of rough dots includes a single cup mark, these peculiarly oriented designs should be dated to a later period. Actually, the dots composing these wheel-and-cross patterns might represent the last transformation of the same concepts underlying the creation of the cup-marks. It is not possible to determine how old this 'transformation' is: the wheels of Lekha-gata 1 (Site 97) would seem to be very ancient to judge by the high degree of erosion. This slab also displays an association in sub-figurative terms of cup-marks with one of the rock icones typical of the late protohistory of Swat: the warrior armed with a shield (found at Sargah-sar and Muhammad-patai). This coexistence, as well as also the associations of cup-marks with rock carvings and painted shelters, might be useful for obtaining a preliminary chronology. There is no doubt that the use of cup-marks continued until historical times: it remains to be determined whether the presence of these artifacts in association with painted Iron Age shelters (?) is contemporary with and therefore related to their cultual function or whether they refer to the utilization or sacralization of these spaces in an earlier or a later period. What is certain is that the frequency of such associations, starting from the case of the shelter with bi-triangular carvings (perhaps late Bronze Age) of Lekha-gata (Site 84), supported the hypothesis of their contemporaneity. Site 26 shows a precise association between cup-marks and the flow of running, drinkable water. This association might be reasonably ascribed to a pre-buddhist horizon or time, as out of the two springs documented on the spot it is the one having constructed walls and steps that is clearly datable to the historical period. Another dating element is provided by the rocks used for sharpening and/or polishing stone and copper-iron axes; at least in one case, we may date the beginning of the use of the stone surface for polishing stone axes or adzes to the 2nd millennium B.C., and its use for sharpening metal axes in the following times. Also this spot showed isolated cup-marks. On the Possible Functions and Meanings of Cup-marked Figurations Our survey suggests a) that large clusters of cup-marks associated with draining or trickle-like grooves appear on large slabs and boulders, both in vertical and horizontal surfaces, on the top of midslope promontories or on important fords; b) that cup-marks sometimes having a larger diameter, isolated, in pairs or, more rarely, in rows, may have been made and used (?) together with tanks and boulders used 164 [44]</page><page sequence="45">for sharpening axes (on horizontal surfaces); c) that cup-marks, round basins and small tanks were made and used at important spring sites (always on horizontal slabs or surfaces). In cases b) and c) cup-marks had self-evident practical functions such as collecting sand and water as an abrasive medium, or gathering water from the spring (28). Although in case a) one cannot exclude that these marks, in spite of their often reduced size, served to collect rain-water, a primary technical function is much less likely; and the presence of grooves and cup-marks on vertical rock surfaces as well, shifts the question on to a representational terrain. The range of the interpretations so far proposed for the function of these artefacts is wide and variable, just like the world-wide diffusion of the phenomenon itself. In the Alps region, the first studies of cup-marks started at the end of the 19th century; for the Subcontinent, further hypotheses were advanced by WJ. Henwood and H. Rivett Carnac (see Mathpal 1995: 9; Agrawal &amp; Kharakwal 1998: 65). After almost two centuries of conjectures, the problems of cup-marks are far from solved: if many rock-artefacts, particularly for the late periods, have a well defined practical function, the older complexes are still mysterious. In south Jordan, E. Borzatti von L?wenstern described a boulder found in the Gebel Amud (Wadi Ramm) (29), a large stone slab studded with complex patterns of cup-marks and interconnecting grooves. He interpreted it as a topographic map: while cup-marks would be village locations, shelters or springs; the interconnecting grooves could represent valleys {wadi). The supposed 'map' would be a good match with the sites' distribution in the area. It was reportedly used to predict the location of previously unknown prehistoric sites, and other boulders too, always according to the Author, might be interpreted in a similar fashion (Borzatti von L?wenstern 1986; 1987: 388-89, figs. 8 11) (30). The topographic interpretation of similar complexes of abstract designs has a long and - so far - scarcely supported tradition in the study of prehistoric art. In (28) Among the cup-marks found in Orissa, one type was interpreted as grinding or pounding holes; some examples of this kind were found in the rocky bed of the shelter Lekhamonda IV, but recent examples are visible near the huts of the Saura settlements (Sadasiba Pradhan 2001: 50-52, pis. 38-39; a rock painting at the shelter of Kathatia might show their actual use, ibid.: fig. 19). The stratigraphic sequence at Lekhamonda goes from Mesolithic to Neolithic-Chalcolithic, up to early historic times. Near the shelters cup-marks are visible, even on vertical rock walls (associated with womb-like ideograms). At Chormoda, some specimens of cup-marks are close to our type a) (Sadasiba Pradhan 2001: pi. 14, figs. 9-10). Similarly, in Kumaon cup marks appear on vertical rock surfaces, on menhirs (Mathpal 1995: pis. 36, 39), on sloping walls (ibid.: pis. 43, 46), besides more common occurrences on horizontal surfaces. By way of hypothesis, it is also possible to cite the doubtful cup marks (or natural erosion) on vertical surfaces documented on a wall of the dromos of a large dolmen shaped shelter at Mashkano-kandao in Kandak (Site 105) (Fig. 42). In Kumaon, there are also larger cup-marks carved with metal tools or drills, definitely belonging to a later period, possibly used as grinding mortars or ukhal (Mathpal 1995: 65). (29) See also the so-called 'stone map' of Rocio Clapier (val Premollo, Piedmont, northern Italy). (30) Note that in the same area cup-marks having practical functions are reported, belonging to a later phase and to Bedouin cultures (Borzatti von L?wenstern 1986: 125). [45] 165</page><page sequence="46">our case, none of the Kandak finds seems obviously compatible with Borzatti von L?wenstern 's proposal. A recurring idea is that these artefacts are astronomic representations and/or star maps (31), but attempts at identifying any match between the cup-marks of Kandak and present stars clusters or constellations have so far proved vain. Like the carved boulders of the Alps, the rocks of Kandak generally rise in elevated spots, along crests and pathways, or near fords and springs. Many authors have proposed for such boulders in the Alps ancient cultual functions, and they are commonly considered some kind of 'altar rock' (32). In the Alps, these stones have frequently been the subject of re-sacralization processes. Small churches and shrines have, in many cases, been constructed over time above or near boulders with cup-marks; marked rocks have been transported near churches and houses, or inserted in their walls; and we have evidence of cup-marks carved in the medieval period in the precincts of churches (see Seglie et al. 1987: 51) (33). Some authors have postulated that cup-marks had a twofold sacred meaning, involving the sky and the mountains, if carved at high altitudes (latin saxa), or the veneration of water, when the same signs accompany the use of springs (latin fontes) (34). There is the possibility that also the cup-mark complexes of the Kandak and other mountain areas of the Subcontinent were similarly carved in the frame of a set of implicit or explicit religious concepts: this would account for the apparent lack of any easily predictable techno-functional regularities in the cup-mark clusters we observed on the field (35). A later form of devotional practice, linked to the worship of water, might be ascribed to a pre-Buddhist substratum subsequently transformed into the (31) See for example the recent study by van Binsbergen (2000), where the author comes to really surprising conclusions concerning the interpretation of cup-marks as schematic figuration diagrams (ibid.: figs. 10,31). (32) For example, italian popular toponyms, in any case datable well after the introduction of Christianity, reflect the ambiguous associations of these artefacts: we have, for example, the 'Roccia delle Masques' (Witches' Stone), the Tietre dei Santi' (Stones of the Saints) (Seglie et al. 1987: 95; Buffoni &amp; Zuccato 1999: 19), and similar names. (33) The cult of arbores, fontes vel saxa or arbores, vel petras, vel fontes (literally: trees, springs and rocks; or trees, rocks, or springs) although prohibited by official Councils, continued without a break. Thus, in spite of official juridical-ecclesiastic rules in the Alpine highlands and in the pagi (rural villages), the religious integration of old and new rituals proceeded together with the re-sacralization of important cultual places. (34) Vedic texts provide abundant references to the use of cups placed or carved on altars, both in domestic rituals and in open-air sacrifices. One important aspect is the preparation of soma within stone cups, gradually filtering the juice and finally collecting it in wooden containers (Varenne 1991: 48). Vedic hymns report a recurrent association between soma, rain and the urine of Indra, or with the rain and the seed of Indra-Parjanya, to be gathered into vessels. The cup-marks from Mount Bego (western Alps) according to de Lumley and Dufrenne (de Lumley 1996: 364-65) might have had similar functions. Another hint of a ritual function of cup-marks might be provided by the Bronze Age 'libation stones' in the Near East (van Binsbergen 1999). (35) The large number of cup-marks, in this case, might be explained with the Vedic ideology of sacrifice, when the consecrated earth and the cups, would revert to plain earth and rock after their use. 166 [46]</page><page sequence="47">'sacred topography' of the Buddhist (in Central India, according to Rivett-Carnac. pre Brahmanical) sacred sites. In India we may still find interesting comparisons amongst living populations, or among cultures described until the recent past. For example, E. Anati (1995: 39-53, fig. 9), in the hill of Bhimbetka (district Raisen, Madhya Pradesh), a world-renowned center of prehistoric cave art, reported a boulder studded with cup marks standing in front of an older painted rock shelter; the contemporary inhabitants ritually poured milk on the cup-marks, regarded as fertility symbols, in the framework of a Naga cult. This practice is interesting because the prehistoric rock paintings, in the Raisen district, are generally avoided by the local tribes and acknowledged as the heritage of unpure spirits (Jacobson 1980). We may also mention another case, a boulder with large cup-marks photographed some decades ago near Pernem, housing in a natural cavity an oblong stone venerated as a divine image and marked with red pigments. The stone is considered as a manifestation of the goddess Bolhai, a local expression of the many mother-goddesses of northern and central India, often eponyms of extinguished tribes, and often still worshipped in rural cults (such as Mengai, Mandhrai, Songjai). In this boulder, at the time of the photograph, the cup marks were still covered by the stones and pebbles used to carve them, presumably by rotatory motion (Kosambi 1987: 48-49, fig. 42). This suggests that even in the past the very act of rotating the stones inside the cup marks on the boulders' surfaces might have ritual implications, perhaps connected to the sound, smell or heat generated by the friction, and possibly through a sexual perception of the ritual act. Both examples, Bhimbetka and Pernem, might be referred to a more general and current practice by rural communities of re-utilizing particular boulders and natural stones, including ancient megaliths, with rituals involving the offering of leaves, fruit, milk and sometimes animal victims. In the Pernem boulder, just as in the Kandak monument (whose cup-marks, in any case, appear smaller than those produced by the stones on the Pernem rock) vertical surfaces show large cup-marks together with curvilinear grooves. Whatever the meaning of rotatory cup-marking as a dynamic event, rocks studded with similar marks or bearing other rock-cut artefacts might have been perceived as anomalous and sacred at later times, and even by different cultural horizons and/or ideologies (36). Even if it does not follow that we must interpret every instance of cup-marks in such a ritualistic perspective, the examples of Pernem and Bhimbetka are hard to ignore. Considering the possibility of a non-technical, representational value of dot-marks and cup-marks, as suggested by the presence of marks and grooves on vertical stone surfaces of some monuments, the possible (36) An interesting evidence comes from the extreme western margin of Eurasia, in Portugal. In the Roman sanctuary of Panoias, in the northern part of the country, there is a big rock carved with large tanks, steps, large cup-marks and S-shaped grooves. It bears a Latin inscription dated to the 3rd century A.D. (CIL II 2395): 'HUIUS HOSTIAE QUAE CADUNT HIC IMM[OL]ANTUR EXTA INTRA QUADRATA CONTRA CREMANTUR - SA[GU]IS LAC[I]CULIS [IUXTA] SUPERFU[NDI]TUR'. [47] 167</page><page sequence="48">Fig. 39 - Jaur-bandai sar (Site 96): sub-figurative composition. (Photo by L.M.O.). explanatory models so far proposed include the following explanations (37): The signs carved in the rock are pictograms representing: 1) a mouth } a head (as in primary compositions in prehistoric art on movable items); 2) the eyes; 3) the sex (being concave, the signs might symbolize female organs). The signs may represent ideograms, representing: 1) water (rain); 2) sex (in rock art, not only in primary compositions); 3) seed (38). Or the signs might be 'psychograms': 1) verbs (actions); } dots (together with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs); 2) emphasizing marks. An English translation would read 'Here are dedicated to the Gods the (animal) victims that here are killed; their entrails are burnt in the square tanks, and their blood runs into the smaller surrounding tanks'. Is it the message of an unbroken ritual continuity, or a later 'learned' re-interpretation? In this Portuguese site, a prolonged period of use is suggested by meaningful variations in the cup-marks; in this light, boulders and rock surfaces with cup-marks and grooves should be considered as peculiar types of altars or offering places, whose location on the mountain tops suggests a close connection with the divinities of the mountains (Area 2002: 4). (37) See Gimbutas 1989; Anati 1994; Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002. (38) This meaning might be supported by the Sargah-sar paintings and by other complexes (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002). Among the Kakash (Chitral) painted dots are identified as peshayak or the fertile droppings of the ibex. 168 [48]</page><page sequence="49">Fig. 40 - Jaur-bandai sar (Site 96): permutations of cup-marks.

From the viewpoint of their grammar, or better their 'syntax' (as defined in Vidale and Olivieri 2002), the larger slabs often present a bigger cup-mark, perhaps the focus of surrounding more extensive compositions. Besides wheel-like designs, there are large stone slabs where dot-marks form circles or lines of representational interest. Note in particular the boulder in Fig. 8, where the wheel seems to be visible alongside double or triple lines, perhaps suggesting an animal followed by a hypothetical sun-like wheel (39). If our interpretation of the central boulder in Site 35 (zoomorphic image phallic figure) is correct the pictographic values of 'head' and 'sex' might be in play (40). (39) Composition using 'dots' is common in the decorations or ideographic patterns visible on the terracotta female figurines of the Swat graveyards. (40) The most typical case of sub-figurative composition using dot-marks is found in Site 120 (Kandak ford). The preliminary study of one of the boulders led the authors to rather surprising conclusions. These conclusions were anticipated at the SAA Conference of Paris in 2001 (Laurenza &amp; Vidale, forthcoming), and will be widely discussed in an article shortly to be published (Vidale &amp; Olivieri, forthcoming). [49] 169</page><page sequence="50">Another case in which the composition of cup-marks and grooves displays sub-figurative features is found at Jaur-bandai sar (Site 96) (Fig. 39). The Lekha-gata 1 slab (Site 97) is thus of great interest. Here we find series of dot-marks forming a concentric wheel and a crossed wheel (there is a third less well conserved wheel). In particular, note should be taken of the presence of cup-marks inside linear compositions in the top left portion, where a cup-mark seems to indicate the head, beside geometric ideograms (Fig. 41). In order to complete the picture of the possible interpretation of cup-mark compositions as visual representations, mention must be made of the boulder in Site 96 with cup-mark permutations that are similar if not identical to those reported by Rivett-Carnac in Kumaon (Fig. 40). We might be quite wrong, but the impression that cup-marks could have been parts of more complex composition systems seems supported by several clues. We do not know if in ancient times in the Subcontinent cup marks were meant to be stained with coloured powders like those used in the ritual design of contemporary domestic folklore, or to retain liquid pigments or milk, or, again, if they were covered by their rotating pebbles, as observed in the Pernem example. Nor do we know whether the hammering that produced the cup-marks or the repetition of this act had some significance from the standpoint of sound or odour (a vertical rock panel with 9 cup-marks, from India, was once identified as a lithophone: see Chackravarty &amp; Bednarik 1997: 59) (41). In similar cases, the perception of a cup-mark composition would be obviously different. Conclusions The carvings, together with the painted shelters we previously reported, might re-open and broaden the horizon of the study of protohistoric Swat. On the other hand, many new ideas and hypotheses are highly conjectural; the finds still lack adequate archaeological contexts - the usual affliction of prehistoric rock art - and the present authors do not feel they are in a position to venture further into such a difficult field. On the base of the preliminary studies of the rock carvings of Gogdara I we propose a sequence of phases, partially correlated with the chronology of the graveyards, i.e. SCS Periods V-VII (Olivieri 1998, 2004, forthcoming a). (41) For example, the case of the site of Taouardei (Mali), where rocks and stones, basins and isolated boulders, rarely touched by man, are interpreted and understood with reference to a 'mental' countryside, where the action of rainfall and wind have the task of animating this 'Place of Identity'. In a central position in the site is a large lithophone: this is an exfoliate boulder provided with a large cup mark that resounds like a large gong when struck (Calegari &amp; Soldini 1983). On the outside wall of the church of San Zeno in Verona (north Italy), the people used to make cup-marks by means of friction: the purpose was to cause the combustion of the sulphur crystals contained in the wall blocks and thereby 'to come into contact with the souls of Purgatory'. 170 [50]</page><page sequence="51">o 00o 0 0a 0 0 00o0 0 000 o oo Fig.41 Leha-ata1 (ite97) 0ole wihcpmrs st telf sae12) 0ll17</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 42 - Mashkano-kandao (Site 105): a cup-marked ?romos? Phase A) an early phase of carving, distinguished by a more naturalistic, sub geometric style (often bi-triangular) characterized by syntactic isolation (Francfort 1998), possibly connected to the ideological world of hunting communities (worship of She-Ibex, of Sacred Trees, and in a broader veneration of a wild world dominated by a Lord of Animals). Some hints suggest a cult of the Mountain and its wild animals, in cultural contexts that have been hypothetically defined Troto-Sivaitic' (Olivieri 1998). Chronologically, this phase might be placed after SCS Period IV of the Swat sequence, roughly placed towards the end of the protohistorical sequence of the Swat valley, in the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. In archaeological terms, we propose associating this first cultural horizon with the late chalcolithic stage of the Swat sequence, i.e. SCS Period V. In the perspective outlined by a long paper of A. Parpola (1988), where he attempts a quite difficult correlation between linguistic and archaeological evidence, this horizon should be defined as Troto Nuristanic\ This phase might be attested at Gogdara I, Bang-doghal (Sect. I) and Lekha-gata (as well as in Bajaur and Hathiano-kandao). Phase B) a subsequent step, dominated by pictograms in a linear (or comb-like) style, by societies of horse breeders, chariot drivers and figures carrying complex standards. The representation shows a descriptive syntax, and makes a wide use of 172 [52]</page><page sequence="53">pictograms. This phase may be ascribed, on the same hypothetical grounds, after the middle of the 1st millennium B.C. (Olivieri 1988: 82). This phase is attested at Gogdara I, Muhammad-patai, Lekha-gata and many other sites, and represents peak of rock-art in Swat. This second phase might, perhaps more confidently, be equated with SCS Periods VI-VII. Such a cultural horizon would incorporate elements of the previous one (even from the stylistical point of view: see for instance the bi-triangular equids of the light chariot at Lekha-gata), but focuses on the symbols of the chariot and the horse. Wherever the horse is absent, for instance in the rock paintings of Kakai-kandao and Sargah-sar, the descriptive element nevertheless prevails, the lexicon gives priority to man's activity, and the icons of the large wild animals - ibex and felines - are rare. When they are present, such as at Sargah-sar, they appear in a secondary position and are balanced by the new icon of the warrior armed with a circular shield. In the 4th century B.C., the Swat valley and the surrounding regions were settled by the people of the Horse, the Assakenoi or Aspasioi of Alexander's historians. These peoples or communities, as far as we can judge, were able to withstand the impact of the Achemenian empire and Alexander's invading army without undergoing any major change (Olivieri 1996: 51, 66) but were deeply affected by the spread of Buddhism. We have previously suggested that this process was not universal, and that at the periphery of the main valley pre Buddhist cultures were less traumatically affected (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002: 43). In A. Parpola's terms, this second horizon should be defined as 'late Vedic' (Parpola 1988: 265; see also Stacul 1970). Phase C) a final phase distinguished by linear style, by the spread of a descriptive syntax, as well as by the lexical characteristic based upon paramount symbols or 'headwords' such as archers, mounted archers and representation of Buddhist architectural features. In this case the dating is easy (lst-3rd century A.D.) and this phase shall be defined as 'Buddhist' (chronologically, and not in cultural terms). This phase is documented at Bang-doghal and in many other sites, as well as in the later paintings of Kandak (at Dwolasmane-patai) and in the Kafir-kot area (Thana), and some also at Swabi and Mardan (Nasim Khan 2000). If this is what we can state for the carvings, even less may be taken for granted for the other rock artefacts described so far. Scanty evidence suggests that the peak of cup-marking might antedate wheels, falling sometimes after 500 B.C. (remember the cup-mark observed on a slab at the graveyard of Jaur-bandai). It is almost certain that the cup-marks occur in phase B, in association with the painted and decorated shelters. The 'wheels' including cross-like designs might perhaps be ascribed to an even later period. Cup-marks associated with tanks and springs possibly lasted till the 1st century B.C.-3rd century A.D., when all the major Buddhist sacred areas of [53] 173</page><page sequence="54">Swat were erected, with an impressive economic investment and a dramatic revolution in the valley's ecology. This phase seems to reflect a culture or an ideology that fully codified a rituality in the access and use of water. This phase is also distinguished by the extensive use of iron tools; it was in this period that the polishing-sharpening marks left by iron or steel axes started to cut through the prehistoric round wear marks left centuries or millennia before by serpentine and granite ground tools. In several areas of the valley, we also witness new activities of extraction and dressing of stone used as building material - not only for the huge yards of the buddhist stupas and monasteries, but also, in marginal areas, for the erection of rare megalithic monuments datable to the Early Historical period. Aspects of a megalithic interest or a megalithic-like technology, on the other hand, were also evident in the slabs of cist graves, in the stone rings found in some graveyards, and in a few menhir/dolmen-like monuments bearing cup-marks. The proposed dating for cup-marking, and their persistence in the historical period, would match the recent results of archaeological research both in Europe and in the Indo-Pakistani Subcontinent. It is hardly deniable that the rock art of the Kandak valley, and of Swat in general, has a generic affinity with the rock art of the European protohistory: the match (probably) includes the absolute chronology, the environmental setting - i.e. valleys that had long since reached a climatic optimum - the basic economy, the graphic techniques, the presence of specific lexical and syntactic forms. The economic background of the most important phase of Swat rock art (phase B), seems to be stock rearing with seasonal transhumance (as reported by Arrianus in Anabasis, IV, 25) and horse breeding, in a mixed economy system also involving husbandry and, to a lesser extent, hunting (this latter activity is archaeologically attested) (see Young 2003). Indeed, if in the carvings of phase A refer to the role of hunters, in phase B hunting, although not a major economic concern, clearly represents a recessive ideological issue which will gradually disappear from rock iconography. The ideological traits connected to the presence of chariots, warriors and standards, might be reflected in the ancient Indian sources, when they speak of the tribes of the north-western mountain areas in terms of M?nnerbunde (Agrawala 1953: 41; Tucci 1977: 37-38). The dating of figuration complexes probably involving agriculture is a difficult question. The absence of depictions of metal tools and weapons, horses and Buddhist elements in some of the shelters might support a quite early dating. On the other hand, if these scenes should be dated after the described husbandry-hunting horizons, they would be dated to a later part of the 1st millennium B.C. (SCS Period VII) when agricultural activities spread to the whole valley. In fact, as remarked by G. Stacul (1998: 455), in the areas where the double cropping cycle is materially 174 [54]</page><page sequence="55">impossible, SCS Period VII is not attested. In this light, the evolution of rock art in the Swat valley would document the progressive growth of a diversified economy and a complex society, in which hunting was allowed to retain an ideological role, heroic figures wearing large round shields were honoured, and agricultural rituals were codified. As far as the political organization is concerned, the analysis of the group scenes in the Kandak paintings suggests a stratified society, in which some individuals possibly played a leading role in important rituals and others were associated with agricultural tools and work; the presence of formalized hierarchies might contrast the apparent equalitarian composition of the grave furnishings in the Swat cemeteries (Erdosy 1989: 44) (42). On the other hand, it should be remembered that according to Alexander's historians, in the 4th century B.C., Swat was ruled by a king who was the eponym of the Assacenian nation (see Erdosy 1995: 85-87). The dating we propose for phase B, at least for the earliest examples, inescapably falls within the time range commonly referred to as Early Iron age (Erdosy 1995: 80; M?ller-Karpe 1983: 96-113) or, in another acceptance, Late Vedic (Allchin 1995: 51). The precise relationships between this important period of the social evolution of the Subcontinent (c. 1200-500 B.C.) and the archaeological evidence of the Swat graveyards had hitherto not been positively defined in cultural terms: one gets the impression that material evidence had been overemphasized or conversely overlooked, relating it to processes conceived of, almost by definition, as marginal (Tusa 1979; Erdosy 1989: 43-44; Allchin 1995: 50). Nonetheless, the idea that the late protohistorical cultures of Swat had developed or adopted a Vedic ideology is shared by several scholars; for G. Erdosy, for example, such an adoption is recognizable '[...] not only in its details, but as a whole [...]' (1989: 43). The most important arguments, in the absence of large exposed settlement areas, concern the emphasis on horse and the funerary rituals. For example, the so-called ashvameda of Katelai I has so far been referred to only incidentally, but would deserve more attention (43). (42) The problem of social homogeneity in the Swat graveyards was recently re-opened in an interesting work by Micheli (1998-99: 164-99). Besides important factors such as funerary architecture (both in terms of form and size) and grave furnishings, the cists were doubtless provided with grave markers or semata. Markers on the surface allowed people to identify the graves that had to be re-used for double or multiple burials. With some rare exceptions in stone (at Timarghara), these markers left no archaeological trace. Thus it is likely that, as reported by Curtius Ruphus {Historiae Alex. VIII 10, 8), such markers were made of wood: '[...] sepulchra [...] vetusta cedro erant facta [...]' ('[...] the oldest graves were made of cedar wood [...]'). Possibly, such markers indicated also the rank or social status of the deceased, as observed for the cemeteries of the Kafirs. (43) New comparative evidence of this ritual has been recorded in Kumaon: in the site of Malari, district Garhwal, several cist-like graves and two horse burials dated between the 5th and the 1st century B.C. were found (Agrawal et al. 1995: 551-52). [55] 175</page><page sequence="56">Other possible hints - at the cost of risky, easily criticizable statements - might come from our analysis of the Kandak painted shelters. At Sargah-sar, a large anthropomorph emerging from what we considered 'ploughed fields' might correspond to the 'lord of the field' (e.g. RV IV 51) or to another deity that, like Sita ('the furrow'), is born out of the ploughed land and re-enters its depths. In the same scene, a particular set of individuals might officiate a ritual protecting or celebrate the act of sowing, and this scene, as well, might match with Rgvedic descriptions (for example RV X 101). In the same shelter, the wild world is represented with an apparent feeling of respect that might also be reflected in Vedic ideology (RV X 146). At Kakai-kandao 1, a monkey might recall Kapi, the monkey-being expressing the concept of autumn equinox, and so on (we are fully aware of the arbitrary nature of similar deductions!). In general, the reference cultural horizon for our designs might appear partly co-literate, that its, sharing themes and motifs that elsewhere might have already been coded in written form (44). In conclusion, there are grounds for hypothesizing that the rock art of the Swat valley reflects a peculiar 'ideological stratigraphy'. In this evolution, a Proto Nuristanic horizon would evolve into, or be superseded by, a later horizon possibly incorporating Vedic traits, to finally meet a horizon where Buddhist features are dominant. The highly visible role of heroes-hunters might be an older inherited feature, incorporated through a gradual integration process. Interestingly, Greek sources associated the conquest of India by Dionysos to a general evolution from a simple hunting economy to a more complex system based upon agriculture and husbandry (see Arrianus, Indike VII 4-9). Then the 'Heraklean' phase lasted for 15 generations and gave birth to a royal lineage (ibid.: VIII 4). The 'great absent' in such a reconstruction is the agricultural world of the 3rd millennium B.C. Preliminary petrographic analysis suggests that the coiled and wheel-made ceramics of Period II in Ghalegay, distinguished by some Kot-Dijan traits, are local products (exactly like the coil-made and mat-marked wares of Period III) and not occasional imports by immigrant foreign traders. So far, Stacul's Periods I and II were encountered solely near the bottom of the Ghalegay trenches. In the Subcontinent, the potter's wheel is usually associated to sedentary settlements' systems and to relatively advanced forms of labour specialization. Can we really assume that in the complex economic reality of the Indus basin, in the Integration (44) The concept of 'co-literate horizon' refers to a scheme for interpreting rock-art described in Olivieri (forthcoming c). The scheme is based on the hypothetical existence of three recurrent or 'universal' horizons, namely: a-literate (when script has not yet been adopted), co-literate (if the script is an allogenous, still unshared, phenomenon - as is the case, for example of many specimens of rock art in the post colonial contact phase and in peripheral and latter-day contexts where rock art remains a common but recessive phenomenon even in recent eras), literate (when the script tends to replace the immediacy of the rock art as a means of expression-communication; this phase is well documented in Chinese protohistory, in the Alps at the dawn of Romanization, in the Arabian Peninsula, etc.). 176 [56]</page><page sequence="57">era (c. 2600-1900 B.C.), the valley and slopes of the Swat were a wild uncivilized region, untouched by agriculturalists? Agriculture in Swat might have been a dynamic, fluctuating economic option, and not the output of a simple, linear evolutionary process. When we will be able to answer this and other related questions, our reconstructions will appear much sounder. REFERENCES Agrawal, D.P., J. Kharakwal, S. Kusumgar &amp; M.G.
