Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 288 pp., $80.00 hard cover; 273 pp., $24.99 paper. The Cambńdge Companion to Uterature on Screen covers much the same ground as The Uterature / Film Reader ; and even contains some of the same contributors (Brian MacFarlane, Sarah Cardwell). In many ways, however, it is a very different kind of book: the edi- tors observe that, in view of the fact that Cambridge University Press has seen fit to publish it, adaptation studies has finally arrived as a "suitable" subject for academic debate (1). MacFarlane's and Timothy Corrigan's contributions provide useful surveys of theoretical developments in the field from the beginning of the last century to the present. While acknowledging the contributions made by George Bluestone (1957), both of them hope that the fidelity question can finally be laid to rest: greater attention should be paid to exploring the gap between disciplinar- ity and adaptation, between literature and film [. . .] adaptation studies necessarily trouble and open disciplinary boundaries" (42). The following chapters focus on the shifting historical contexts of adaptation. Douglas Lanier's survey of Shakespeare on film begins in the late nineteenth cen- tury and culminates with Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Shakespeare in Uove (1998). He concludes that Shakespeare has been constructed in recent times as a filmmaker rather than a literary giant (73). Linda V. Troost offers a comprehensive guide to Jane Austen adaptations, although I can't help but feel that she prefers Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice (2005) to all the previous versions of the novel, simply because it drags the text out of the prison-house of "literature" and transforms it into a teen-oriented romance. Martin Halliwell's and Peter Brooker's essays focus on the modernist and postmodern aspects of adaptation; both identify Stephen Daldry's The Hours (2002) as a film containing both elements. I found both contribu- tions invaluable in their determination to show what elements render an adaptation modernist or postmodern, while simultaneously showing how it can "open out an alternative, underdeveloped, or suppressed trace" in its source-material (115). This comment is strongly reminiscent of Tom Leitch's observation (made in his recent book Adaptation and its Discontents [2007]) that adaptations need to be treated as creative works in their own right.</page><page sequence="2">236 /Mapping Adaptation Studies A farther section "Genre, Industry, Taste" shows how adaptations are shaped by several criteria - institutional, and cinematic - as well as audience taste. Eckard Voigts-Virchow rehearses familiar arguments about "Englishness" and the heri- tage film, but provides an interesting sideline in his analysis of German television adaptations of Rosamund Pilcher's Mills and Boon novels, that create a German- inspired view of Englishness. Imelda Whelehan's discussion of Now Voyager (1 942) also follows a well-trodden scholarly path, as it shows how Irving Rapper's film version was shaped by Bette Davis's star image. Deborah Carimeli looks at how. different genres of children's literature, ranging from classics such as The Wizard of 0% to more commercial texts such as P. L. Travers's Mary Poppins, have been adapted by various film studios. She is particularly convincing in her discussion of "Disneyfication" (168-74). The book's final section suggests new approaches for adaptation studies that are very different from those proposed in The JJterature / Film Reader. Paul Wells's analysis of the animated version of Animal Farm (1954) shows how animation sustains the "radical energy" at the heart of Orwell's novella by investing the characters with horrifically anthropomorphic qualities. Annette Davison looks at how music con- tributes to the effect of adaptations such as Visconti's Death in Venice (1971). I was a little surprised to find nothing on musicals such as Oliver! (1968) or Mel Stuart's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (discussed in Cartmell's contribu- tion (176-77), but perhaps this was beyond the scope of this essay. Jan Baetens outlines another fascinating area of research by concentrating on novelizations of the screenplay. A good example of this is provided by Blade Runner (1982), based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968). The film proved so successful that Dick's book was reprinted, using the film tide rather than the original. In addition Hampton Fancher's and David Peoples's script was rewritten and published in strip cartoon by Marvel Comics. The book concludes with transcripts of two interviews with the prolific British adapter Andrew Davies, who explains his working practices as well as discussing his latest (2005) work on Bleak House. What is perhaps most intriguing about the Cambridge Companion is the fact that certain adaptations keep cropping up in several contributions. Austen is particularly popular - as well as Troost's essay, there are separate discussions of Pride and Prejudice (1995) and Emma (1996). Dickens attracts similar critical attention - as well as the Davies interviews, there are discussions of David Lean's Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1947). J. R. R. Tolkein and J. K. Rowling are popular subjects, with good reason in view of the success of the Lord of the Rings and the Hany Potter series. Virginia Woolf also merits extended discussion. On the other hand classic authors such as Hawthorne, Poe, and Cooper rate scarcely a mention, while there is hardly anything on post-1945 American literature adaptations. Perhaps more attention should have been paid to the politics of adaptation studies, rather than concentrating on individual authors. There are a couple of minor errors: Alan Ladd's name is wrongly spelled (93), while Claude Rains was certainly more well-known in Hollywood than Whelehan's observation seems to suggest: "[He] had been in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1 45) . Rains had come to the United States after a distinguished career on the British</page><page sequence="3">Mapping Adaptation Studies/237 stage and screen, and had already starred in James Whale's seminal Invisible Man (1933). These blemishes apart, the book provides a useful addition to the rapidly expanding corpus of adaptation studies texts. However, I do think that it is now time to move beyond the narrow confines of literature-film studies and consider in more general terms what "adaptation" means. Only then will the discipline suc- cessfully liberate itself "from unprofitable ťeye for an eye' comparisons" between one text and another (3). Laurence Raw Baskent University, Turkey Editor's Note Laurence Raw's recent publications include Adapting Henry Jams (2006) and AdaptingNathanielHawthorne to the Screen (2008). He is currendy preparing The Encyclopedia of Ridley Scott , as well as an anthology on the pedagogy of adaptation studies (with Jim Welsh and Dennis Cutchins). Both books are scheduled to appear in 2009.</page></plain_text>
