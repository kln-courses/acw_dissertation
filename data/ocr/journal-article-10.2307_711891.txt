<plain_text><page sequence="1">61 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW makes little or no use here of T. B. L. Webster's Studies in Later Greek Comedy (Manchester 11953, 21970, index s.v. mythological comedy), nor does he bring into his discussions the vase-paintings of Magna Graecia, which are now recognised to portray (at least sometimes) scenes from Attic comedy. Yet N.'s conclusions seem well grounded, even though he does not'take cognisance of the fact that varying types and amounts of myth travesty and tragic or dithryrambic parody can be found in plays whose titles give no indication of this (e.g. Ar. Ach., Thesm., Plut., Men. Sik.). N. also emphasises the use made in Middle Comedy of passages in high-flown ' dithyrambic' language, spoken often by slaves or cooks, and in anapaestic dimeters; both may be designed to effect a contrast with the mundanity of their comic contexts, although the loss of those contexts makes any positive statement hazardous. N. finally deals with the apparently innovative use of certain type roles (such as parasites and cooks) in Middle Comedy. When dealing with the portrayal of the parasite in Alexis' Parasitos, N. still challenges (as in his earlier book) the view I took of Alexis' priority (GRBS 9 [1968], 161ff.), without attempting to confront the argument from the language of fr. 178.1-2 Kock and the Roman parallels. Synthesising all his arguments, discoveries and conclusions, N. plausibly claims that 380-50 B.C. was the core period of Middle Comedy, with transitional periods of from 20 to 30 years on both sides.

In poetry, gods are people too. Ancient epic, F. argues, was history - in their sense, not ours - adorned by myth. The mythical element came via the gods, conceived of in generic terms as anthropomorphic deities in the Homeric mould. These gods, of sheer necessity, function in epic as literary vehicles ('what else can they be?', p. 46), as characters no less than do the humans in the poems. Thus the plausibility of epic is as dependent on the success of the (avr'aafa, of the gods as agents in the narrative, as it is on what we perceive as ' realistic' action on the human plane. The difficulty is created by the gap between the gods as Homer presents them and later 'purer' ways of thinking about them, between the autonomy of poetry in choosing its means of representation and the realities of post-Homeric piety. The second chapter of F.'s study reveals an Apollonius self-consciously foregrounding the problem. For example, the famous scenes where the goddesses plot to ensnare Medea, and Eros hunts her down, are often praised for their psychological realism. Though Apollonius was aware of the 'naturalism' and exploited it, modern critics are misled by preconceptions of the nature of fiction which derive from seeing the novel as a standard. F. insists that not only must Eros' descent be seen in narrative terms ? Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">62 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW literally and not just as traditional icing on the psychological cake, but also that it is an important vehicle of meaning. The frivolity and ' kitschy antics' (p. 82) are at odds with the human emotions of Medea, something which is all part and parcel of a general disjunction between the human and the divine which the Homeric machinery serves to highlight. Apollonius' concern with the nature of the authority of fiction is revealed by the narrator's collapse back into reliance on the Muses (4.1-5) after having ostentatiously dispensed with them in Book I. The Argonautica thus uses its 'clammy atmosphere of uncertain confusion' (p. 89) in the divine sphere as a major vehicle of its pessimism. A transitional chapter establishes the domestication by Naevius and Ennius of Zeus as that most Roman of gods, Juppiter Capitolinus Optimus Maximus, and his cosmic concern for the descendants of Aeneas. This is preparation for the chapter on the Aeneid, where F. really gets into his stride. A few pages, with great economy, describe Virgil presenting a Juno who is at once the 'historical' and ' Ennian' Tanit, the Trojan-hating Hera of the Iliad and Theagenes' allegorized aer (pp. 131-4). The series of complex levels of hostility to Rome is, F. argues, concentrated in its terror and power by means of the fictive character of an anthropomorphic Juno whose realization as a character unites them. Similarly Allecto's assaults on humans in Book 7 are not just poetic colour, nor a means of psychological revelation. Rather they are seen as powerfully expressing through fantasy what in human terms cannot be accounted for: Amata's disturbing mix of Bacchic frenzy and logical lucidity, Turnus' catastrophic surrender to battle lust, the utter madness of civil war. Nor is this a neutral technique. F. attacks rationalistic readings of this scene which convict Turnus of inherent responsibility for the war -acquitting him here naturally has great consequences for our interpretation of his death at the hands of Aeneas. Again, Jupiter is an agent of the narrative rather than an incarnate principle of Fate. He keeps a monster under his throne and 'his area of operation includes (without sublimating) the realms of evil and death' (p. 153). For F. the narrator does not subscribe wholeheartedly to Jupiter's perspective and the Aeneid remains a ' dismaying poem' (p. 155). F.'s case is powerfully argued and offers a reading demonstrably closer to ancient conceptions than most recent criticism. It will provide strong support for those whose Virgil is uneasy with the glories of Augustus' rule. The following chapter on the Metamorphoses, on the other hand, is unlikely to change anyone's view of that poem substantially. F. sees Ovid in familiar terms, as playing with Homeric anthropomorphism. His particular application of this insight is to show Ovid examining a world of flux where it is difficult to draw the dividing line between gods and humans: 'are the gods like us or not?' is seen as being equivalent to 'does the world make sense in human terms?' The answer provided is that Ovid tantalizes us with gods that almost present a validating framework for human activity only to whip it away and leave us in a paysage demoralise. This is convincing enough, but F. primarily succeeds in demonstrating the truth of his opening assertion that the Metamorphoses is 'an uncategorizable multi-form prodigy' (p. 189). Quite so: does anyone really have a clue what the Metamorphoses is 'about'? For F. the cloud of unknowing thickens with Lucan. If the Argonautica is depressing and the Aeneid dismaying, the De Bello Civili is downright miserable. F.'s excellent analysis shows us the Eeyore of Roman epic, sitting floppy-eared by the lugubrious waters of an outplayed tradition. F. persuasively contends that modern praise of Lucan's ' realism' misses the point, and emphasizes that the ancient view that his work is history not poetry rests on the fact that he has dropped what, apart from metre, constituted the principal generic difference between history and epic, that is</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 63 (cavram'a. Historians accept the existence of gods, of portents, of Fortuna, but they do not directly portray scenes in heaven or Olympians in action, and the same is true of Lucan. This is not a rationalistic text - it contains startling scenes of necromancy and prophecy - but it relentlessly exploits the absence of the gods as its 'principal device for obfuscation and aporia' (p. 285). Lucan entirely cuts out the frame of reference the reader of epic was generically conditioned into expecting, and leaves him adrift in a world where man cannot have even the bitter comfort of design with malevolence and the gods are replaced by a cult of Caesar damned by the surface ironies of the text itself. Silius' seventeen books merit only ten pages, and his use of the gods is pronounced conventional and a miserable failure: F. is a devotee of' Silver' epic but it is expedient that one man should die for the people. Valerius, however, is given his due measure of praise, as a thoughtful poet who engineers the destruction of his own martial epic (Book 6), but only in order to conftate epic with elegy and reaffirm a kind of Homeric-Ovidian view of the gods. Praise is tempered with regret that Valerius did not use the ironies of his model (p. 377) and we are reminded that not all poets possess all gifts. laudatur et alget: too cheerful perhaps? Strength calls to strength, however, and the acuity of vision seen in the sections on Virgil and Lucan re-emerges in the fine discussion of the Thebaid. F. demonstrates how Statius' 'gorgeous poem' (p. 337) ironically anticipates in its self-conscious text most of the obtuse criticisms usually levelled at it by those who neither understand Statius' technique nor know a tenth as much as he did about his tradition. Following C. S. Lewis, F. also offers an excellent exposition of the creation of a new means of narrative in the array of allegorical figures who displace and eclipse the Olympians. Important too is the account of how Statius removes the gods from the action after the duel of Thebaid 11, and then the allegorical figures soon after. A world of near- Manichaean duality with Jupiter and Tisiphone at opposite poles gives way to a lonely one in which humanity, led by its own instinct for justice and by a divine Clementia which is the spiritual embodiment of its own nobility, asserts without heavenly aid the human right of burial. For F., however, this last book and a half are less a triumph than an anti-climax, as Statius 'suggests the weakness of human attempts to make sense of [the gods'] catastrophe' (p. 363). A subjective reading, of course, as F. would no doubt agree, and one which takes no account of the magnificent - if to us unutterably alien - heroism of Argia or Evadne, one which would have perplexed Prudentius or Dante with their far greater sensitivity to the merits of the sanctified lunatic. A different reading will yield a Thebaid, which, like the Aeneid, offers a limited and a melancholy optimism, hard won but all the more valuable for that. But perhaps what is most impressive about F.'s study is the calm with which he assumes that Statius is a poet with something to say, someone well worth arguing about. In a book covering so much ground, it will be impossible to agree with every word. F. himself is sensitive to the dangers of polemic, which tends to be buried in footnotes. Still, one leading critic of Virgil may be surprised to learn that his work betrays 'a fundamental unwillingness to come to terms with the genre' (p. 172) and not everyone will so cheerfully offer incense on the altars of Johnson (p. 171) and Henderson (p. 273 n. 106). The author's own leanings towards the 'Harvard' school are not disguised, and those who subscribe to that view of the Aeneid have found an eloquent advocate. In future discussions of that poem, as of Lucan and Statius, this splendid book will likely prove indispensable. University of Calgary M. J. DEWAR</page></plain_text>
