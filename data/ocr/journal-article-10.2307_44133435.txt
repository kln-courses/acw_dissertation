It is veiy difficult to seek satis- factory explanation to some of the rites, whether they are of modern or of ancient communities. Similarly, amongst the many puzzling aspects associated with the megalithic monuments, the port-hole is a mysterious feature, which defied proper explana- tion so far. Port-hole is a feature noticed on the megalithic cists, dolmens and dolmenoid-cists which are constructed out of stone slabs. Though this feature is noticed on the megalithic monu- ments all over the world, its origin and exact purpose is still a mystery. This paper aims at examining the available information on the port- holes from various sources and also attempts an explanation to the reasons behind its origin. Port- hole is an aperture on one of the orthostat of a megalithic monument. In the Indian context, there are two types of port- holes i.e. i) round port-hole and 2) łLT shaped port-hole. Round port-hole (Pl.I) is usually associated with the monu- ments constructed out of thin stone slabs. They are more com- mon with the swastika pattern cists and dolmens. Comparatively they are smaller than the 'U' shaped port-holes and their diameter may vary from few centimeters to one meter, but 20 to 60 cms. diameter is the usual size. Though some of the port-holes of this type admit small children and normal built persons, a majority of them are much smaller. Some of the sites with this type of port-hole are Brahmagiri,1 Iralabanda,2 Chagaturu,3 Up- palapadu,4 Peddamarrur,5 Pandavarbande,6 Timmalapatti,7 Togarapalli,8 etc. 'IT shapped port-hole (Pl.II) is usually found associated with the cists and dolmenoid-cists constructed out of very thick slabs. The thickness of the slabs may be upto 40 centimeters. Some of the port- holes of this variety may attain squarish shape due to the careful chiselling of the bottom line. These port-holes are usually big and may vary between 35 centimeters and 1 meter in width with an equal or little more height. The monuments as- sociated with this type of port-hole are usually very huge and the</page><page sequence="2">HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, EPIGRAPHY AND NUMISMATICS 965 port-hole big enough to allow a normal built person. The reasons for keeping a larger port-hole will be discussed later in this paper. Some of the sites with this type of port-hole are Rajankolur,9 Aihole,10 Karikan Thangal,11 Odugattur,12 Bodampatti,13 Mal- luru,14 Mangapet,15 Kaper laguru,1 etc. There seems to be some belief with respect to the orientation of the port-hole. The orientation of the port-hole varies form region to region and from place. Whereas, east, west and south are the most common direction, north seems to be very rare. We also observe slight variation of the orientation in the same direc- tion with respect to different monuments of the same group. This is probably due to the dependence on the Sun to determine the cardinal directions. The seasonal variation of the Sun's alignment might have influenced the orientation of the monuments as well as the port-holes. Thé orientation of the port-hole has some relation to the Sun as observed at Iralabanda. Here it was noticed that the port-hole is not only oriented to the east, but the successive slabs of the stone circle in front of the port-hole are also pierced in alignment so as to allow the morning sun rays to strike the interior of the monument17. But this type of relation to the sun could not be established at other places, though some of the port-holes are oriented to the east and the west perhaps in the relation to the Sun observation of the megalithic people. Regarding the obser- vance of the west and south orientation, we cannot give any convincing explanation at present, except that the south is con- sidered as the direction of Varna, the Death God of Hindu mythol- ogy- Passage and Closure of the Port-hole At several places it was noticed that a passage is provided in front of the porthole18. This is as if to lead the way to the port-hole or to suggest an entrance or exit through the port-hole. This feature is very common in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Sometimes, the port-hole is blocked by a slab of stone19. The exact reason behind this blocking is not known, though we can presume that, it was primarily intended for the protection of the contents in the monuments. But, in the course of time its significance seems to have changed. The blocking of the port-hole and the passage are the features noticed commonly with the cists and dolmenoid cists which are underground. Another interesting feature noticed at several places in the</page><page sequence="3">966 PROCEEDINGS IHC : 5 7TH SESSION, 1996 megaliths of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is that the tran- septing slab of the cist is also pierced as if to provide access from one chamber to the adjoining chamber. But, most of these port- holes in the transepting slabs are not big enough to allow human entiy. There are several explanations by different scholars as to the purpose of the port-hole. There are suggestions that they are meant for interring oblations periodically. But, this is not correct as many of the port-hole are underground and there is no evidence, so far, from any quarter suggesting removal of the earth packing in the subsequent period to have an access to the port- holes which are sub-terrain. On the same ground we have to reject the suggestion that the port-hole was intended to inter skeletal remains whenever death occurred on the family or the community. This opinion has probably cropped up from the fact that the megalithic monuments contain skeletal remains of several individuals and some thought them to be family vaults meant for repeated use. It was also suggested that the port-hole was meant for providing access to the ghost or spirit which lives in them or an access to the soul of the dead which escapes to the other world20. Though the reason behind the origin of the port-hole seems to be different, in later period belief in spirits and ghost seems to have gained currency as we come across port-holes which are too small for human entiy . The Kurumbas believe that the spirits of their ancestors live in the dolmens and they worship near the dolmens by offering food and drinks to propitiate the spirits in times of difficulties . Similarly the Savaras present the seeds in front of the dolmens with the belief that the ancestors would help in promoting the fertility22. The Gonds believe that the departed become ghosts23. They cite three reasons for constructing the megalitic monuments. First, the 'soul' need not wander after death; second, they must not worry or harm the descendants; and third, they must help in bringing rain and driving away the harmful and destructive spirits. Thus, the beliefs or different tribais who practice megalithism, suggest their faith in ghosts, spirits and souls which are believed to live in the megalithic monuments. Naturally, for their access the megalithic people made provision in the form of port-holes. At several places it has been noticed that the port- holes are blocked by a 4door-slab' The blocking of the port-hole was probably meant to seal the passage of the spirit or ghost which</page><page sequence="4">HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, EPIGRAPHY AND NUMISMATICS 967 might tiy to escape out and wander. At Mahur Jhari24 and Kadambapur25 it was noticed that the lower extremeties of the skeletons were missing. It seems that the megalithic people deliberately chopped off the lower portions to prevent the dead from returning to the earthly world. Considering this fact and the sealing of the port-hole, we may be justified in assuming their belief in spirits or ghosts. The association of anthropomorphic sculptures with the megalithic monuments26 as noticed at Aihole, Domad, Dongatogu, kaperlaguru, Mallur, Mangapet, Mot- turu, and Tottigutta is also a pointer in their spiritual or religious belief27. Interesting evidence in this regard comes from Egypt, where some paintings were discovered in the burial chambers, showing persons blowing incense through tong tubes into the port-holes28. All this evidence and association of elaborate funerary assemblage supports the view that the megalithic people believed in spirits, ghosts and in post-death life and we have to view the port-holes in this perspective. Though the reasons mentioned above have some consideration in understanding the purpose behind the port-hole, more plausible explanation for the origin of the port-hole seems to lie in the size and method of the construction of megalithic monu- ments. Megalithic dolmens and dolmenoid cists are very huge, requiring great effort and activity in their construction. When so many people and so much of activity is involved, naturally, these cannot be merely for the purpose of keeping the skeletal remains and funerary assemblage at the place intended. Thus, the monu- ment was required to be erected first and then mortal remains along with the assemblage interred. This obviously, required an access through which the above things could be interred after the monument is erected. This requirement must have given rise to the idea of carving an access in one of the orthostats of the monument, which seems to be the actuad reason behind the origin of the port- hole. In course of time the port-hole has been attached with several other beliefs, rather than the primaiy com- pulsion which resulted in its origin. The original objectives then lost the earlier significance. Thus it has become symbolic, dimunitive in size, aligned with the position of the Sun and even passage is provided as if it is a regular entry and exit point. NOTES 1. R.E.M.

The author has personally observed at this site that the port-holes of the successive slabs of the circle are pierced in alignment to allow the Sun rays to strike the interior of the chamber. Branfill (B. R. Branfill. op.cit., 98) observed that the alignment of port-holes of the circle slabs are not in a line as to allow the Sun rays to shine through successive slabs. But. he has failed to notice that some of the slabs of the circles are tilted in the course of time, and hence improper alignment of the port-holes-occured. 18.
