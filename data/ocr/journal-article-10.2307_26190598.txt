King Sherman Wilcox College of William and Mary University of New Mexico Editor ial  Scope Sign Language Studies publishes a wide range of original scholarly articles and essays relevant to signed languages and signing communities. The journal provides a forum for the dissemination of impor- tant ideas and opinions concerning these languages and the communities who use them. Topics of interest include linguistics, anthropology, semiotics, Deaf culture, and Deaf history and literature. Although the journal is especially interested in work concerning Deaf communities, signed languages used by hearing people are also of interest.
