A remarkable change has taken place, within the last quarter of a century?to some extent in England, much more decidedly abroad?in the treatment of all questions that bear upon the history and import of Christianity. By most writers, Catholic and Protestant, for at least two centuries after the Reformation, the stream of history which has its source in the Gospel, was supposed to flow in a channel of its own, parallel with the great tide of human affairs, and dis tinct from it?the two currents sometimes passing over into each other, and mixing mechanically but never enter ing into permanent combination or becoming one substance. In consequence of this separation, Christianity has been surveyed too exclusively under a single point of view; it has been identified with theology and the Church ; and its manifold affinities with the general progress of our race have been almost overlooked. More recently a new spirit has sprung up. Men are weary of this narrow, one-sided, aspect of the greatest fact in human history. They have outlived the shallow moquerie of the school of Yol taire; but in taking back their faith, are unwilling to let go their humanity, and would fain learn what Christianity is, and what Christianity has done, by tracking its footsteps in the many bypaths that branch off from the broad highway of the Church?by observing how it has penetrated the inner heart of society, and colored every product of the human mind?every expression of human feeling?laws, manners, literature, and Art. To minds of a certain cast the descent may appear humiliating from the high questions of speculative theology, to such manifestations of the religious life as we meet with in popular poetry or in the material forms of symbolism and Art. But it is the circulation of the life-blood through these minuter veins, which imparts the ruddy glow of vitality to the complexion of a period. Here we feel the beating pulse, that attests the presence of a living human ity. Theology may pile up a more showy edifice of words on some vague assumption; but here are facts, revealing the actual condition and feeling of multitudes ages ago; and the more diligently all such facts are brought up from the dark abysses of time, and made clearly discernible to the retrospective eye, the more will history lose its bleak and vacant look and kindle into expression, and the phenomena that are spread over its surface, become significant of the deeper life that was once in operation beneath them. Under the Formative Arts, we comprehend Architecture, which has its origin iu the necessities of habitation?and the Arts more immediately Imitative, whether representing forms on a plain surface, or molding them wholly or in part out of the solid mass?which spring from the instinc tive desire in the human mind of giving permanent expres I sion to every idea by which it is vividly affected. To this latter impulse we owe the arts of Painting and Sculpture. Architecture stands apparently in a closer relation to the utilities of mankind; but it is a fact to be distinctly noticed, that all the three arts which we have called Formative, received their earliest impulse from the religious principle, and under its influence entered into a union and sympathy, I which was never afterward entire dissolved in either of their two great periods of Heathen and Christian develop ment. Art in its higher sense is not the mere copying of external objects?it is the expression of an idea or v. senti ment through a material form. This character it derives from its religious origin. The physical wants of life .do not possess an interest sufficiently grand and awakening to call it forth; they are satisfied with immediate fruition; and, as if conscious of the meanness of their source, desire no lasting and conspicuous record of their existence. Not till a later period, does luxury borrow from the creations of a higher power, the lustre that sheds a spiritual grace on its elaborate provisions for comfort and self-indulgence. In i the commencement of society, before acquired associations have obscured the primary distinction of things?it isi only a sense of his mysterious relation to the invisible agencies of the universe, that seems capable of acting with so much force on the imagination and feelings of man, as to give the idea a preponderance over all the impressions of sense, and to impel him to seek relief from the bewildering tumult of his emotions, by embodying it in some visible svmbol. His intense consciousness of spiritual life peoples the void with forms and acts resembling his own. He fashions the gods in his own image; and surrounds himself with a visionary society of great and wonderful beings, whose names he reveres as a talisman of strength, and in whose honor he puts forth all his resources of tentative skill, guided by the unfolding sense of symmetry and beauty. Thus while his own dwelling is confined and unsubstantial, plain and un adorned, just subserving the necessities of shelter?he rears a colossal pile, court within court, for the house of the Divinity?gigantic statuary lining its avenues and guarding its entrance, and the bright hues and strongly-marked con tour of incipient design clothing with a mimic life its inte rior walls. This propensity to express spiritual conceptions in material forms, whether, as iu the East, it remain fixed in a monstrous incorporation, of the symbolical wiin the anthropomorphic, or as among the Greeks, it disengage itself into the purely human?marks a stage in the process of mental development, through which all nations have passed, the Hebrews themselves not excepted.

Torlt.</page><page sequence="2">326 THE C E __ Y Q JST ._ It is quite clear from the Old Testament, that the second commandment was not observed to the letter. Repre sentations of fruits and flowers profusely decorated the tabernacle, and the temple of Solomon. Within the sanc tuary two images of cherubim shaded with expanded wings the mercy-seat, and indicating the presence of Jehovah ; while figures of the same mysterious beings were raised in relief on the walls and doors, or wrought in the tapestry which hung across the entrance of the Holy of Holies* Maimonides limited the prohibition of the Deca logue to the human form, and freely conceded the repre sentation of animals, trees and plants.f Even this pro hibition related rather to the medium of expression, than to the object of conception.J In the sphere of pure imagination?poetry substituted for the arts of design?no people of antiquity ever allowed themselves a freer use of sensuous ideas in the representations of deity, than the Hebrews. The visions of their old prophets exhibit the most distinct and definite outline of anthropomorphic con ception.? The image was already there, developed in its full proportions?prepared to start into visible expression and clothe itself in a bodily form?had not the voice of the legislator come between the thought of the poet and the hand of the artist, and intercepted their communication. By these remarks we do not mean to underrate the conse quences of the prohibition. For the conservation and development of pure Monotheism, we believe them to have been all-important. For, when a spiritual idea has once translated itself into a shape cognizable by the outward sense, the limits of its future unfolding are forever deter mined by the possibilities of Art. It may reach the beauty which Art can express. It may exhibit the human in its .highest external perfection; but beyond that point, its growth must be checked by a hard material barrier which cannot be passed. Whereas the pure idea left to itself, and not thus physically circumscribed, may undergo expan sion and refinement without limits. For the happiness of mankind, such was the history of the idea of G-od among the Jews. Before the time of Christ, it had cast off much of the ancient anthropomorphism, and become refined and spiritual. In the second temple, the cherubim disappeared from the sanctuary, and other symbolical representations were omitted, which had adorned the first. Meanwhile, the Hellenic mind had been following an other direction, and had ended in almost identifying the popular religion with a mere production and reverence of Art. All spiritual life had gone out of its worship, and only the exterior form remained. Among the effects of the preaching of Christianity, was ?n intermingling and recipro cal modification of the Jewish and Hellenic tendencies? * Exod. xxv. xxvi. 1 Kings, vi. f Munter, Sinnbilder und Kunstvorstell, etc. Einleit. p. 4. X " Thou Bhalt not make unto thyself any graven image." Exod. xx. 4. ? Compare, among other passages, 1 Kings, xxii. 19-22, Isaiah vi. 1-8, and especially Ezekiel, i. 26-28, and Daniel, vii. 9, 10. a fact of no little importance in the general history of civili zation, but of marked influence on the development of Christian Art. It should be noticed, as a natural consequence of the anthropomorphic conceptions of religion, which gave its earliest impulse to Art, that the primitive idea of a temple was not that of a meeting-place for fellow-worshippers, but that of a bouse for God. The celia of the heathen sanc tuary and the most holy place of the Hebrew temple, with drawn into the inmost recess of the sacred edifice, and separated from the profane world by outer courts of inter mediate degrees of holiness?were regarded as the proper habitation, in one case, of the embodied manifestation of deity, and, in the other, of the invisible presence that " dwelt between the cherubim." With the local residence of the God, the enjoyment of his protection aud blessing was believed to be associated ; and as among the heathen his departure was sometimes attempted to bo hindered by attachiug a chain to the leg of the statue, so among the more enlightened Israelites the presence of the ark was considered a certain pledge of success.* These ideas were not without their influence in Christian times: although in Solomon's dedication prayer f we discern already the awakening of more elevated and spiritual views; and the subsequent erection of synagogues, devoid of the peculiar associations attaching to a temple?wherever the Jewish race was spread?must have tended to break down the old traditional belief, and by making social worship a more prominent feeling in men's minds than the local presence of deity, have prepared the way for the doctrine of Christ, that acceptable adoration was not confined to place, but might be offered to the Great Paternal Spirit, wherever two or three were gathered together in faith and love. The first outbreak of Christianity involved a complete dis ruption of all connection with Art. The pervading idea of the new religion was the expectation of approaching judgment, for which believers must prepare by lives of the strictest holiness and of entire separation from the fashion able tastes and pursuits of the heathen world. Under such feelings death was a subject of deeper interest to them than life. It seemed preposterous to think of erecting stately and durable edifices in a scene that must shortly pass away forever; and, except their private meetings for prayer and mutual exhortation at each other's houses, it was chiefly at the graves of their departed friends?espe cially of such as had sealed their faith with their blood? that they assembled from time to time for the exercise of social devotion. Cemeteries, therefore, in which churches were often afterward erected, were of earlier origin than churches themselves. There is at least no evidence of public buildings set apart for the worship of the Christians before the middle of the third century. Of churches in this sense we find no clear trace in Africa as late as the time of Cyprian.J The first approach toward the recognition of a * I Sam. iv. 3, 4. ? 1 Kings, viii. 27. t A.D. 250. See Munter, Priraordia Ecclesi African?, p. 31.</page><page sequence="3">THE OK__YON. 3?7 particular building as a church, consisted probably in fitting up for regular social worship, some spacious apartment in the house of a wealthy Christian? It must have been in a room of this nature that the simple rites of the primitive society described by Justin Martyr, were performed.* Large en tertaiuing saloons {triclinia) well adapted for this purpose, were often found in the dwellings of the rich; and from their size and sumptuous decoration, and resemblance in their general arrangements to the public courts, of whieh we shall shortly speak, were called by the Romans, as Kinkel informs us, Basilic .f During the first half of the third century, under emperors of the syncretistic spirit, such as Heliogabalus and Alexander Severus and amidst civil troubles which blunted the edge of heathen fanaticism ?the Christians rapidly increased in numbers and in bold ness; and their ancient places of assembling no longer sufficing to contain them, new and more capacious buildings appear now for the first time to have been raised on independent foundations.! About the same time, we begin to read of public churches in Gaul and Spain and Britain. They were probably still more numerous in the East. In the persecution of Diocletian, a splendid church which adorned the most beautiful part of the city of Nicomedia in Bithynia, was levelled with the ground. But the great building of churches, and the fixation of a type of ecclesiastical architecture, did not commence till after the triumph of Christianity over heathenism, with the accession of Constantine to the empire in the early part of the fourth century. The new religion now found that it had an interest in the present world, as well as in the next; and the fervor of the primitive enthusiasm which had checked all sympathy with literature and art, began sensibly to abate. The effects of this change were at once conspicuous in the whole outward manifestation of Christianity. The rejoicings of the Christians iu their altered circumstances, the new churches they built, and their dedication-feasts?-have been dwelt on with an evident zest by Eusebius.? In a speech addressed to Paulinus bishop of Tyre, and evidently composed by himself, he has left us a very minute description of a large and splendid church erected in that city; through the vague grandiloquence of which we obtain a tolerably distinct view of the general character and distribution of the edifice, and ascertain two facts of no little importance * Apol. i. 57. At one end of it there was probably a raised plat form?[pulpitum, suggestum) somewhat resembling the medieval dais ?for the speakers, and furnished with a simple table of wood, not yet called ara or altare, for the celebration of tbe Lord's Supper. t He mentions a specimen still extant in Rome, the Triclinium Laterani, built by Pope Leo III., at the beginning of the ninth century. Gesch. der bild. K?nste, p. 48. t Such seems the proper force of Eusebius's language (Hist. Eccles. viii. 1) in speaking of the times before the persecution of Diocletian. ? Hist. Eccles. x. 2, 3. The greatness of the transition is Btrongly marked in many of his expressions. The old churches seem to have been a kind of sacred fortresses. He thus contrasts them with the new. Even in the new church, built under such favorable auspices at Tyre, the strength of the outer wall indicates the precau tions natural after a recent season of persecution. for the history of Sacred Art:?first, the decided abandon ment, at this time, of the simple forms of the old synagogue worship which had been followed by the early Christians, for the model of a proper temple?like that of Jerusalem* ?with its successive divisions of increasing sanctity, cor responding to the supposed qualifications of the several grades of worshippers ; and secondly, the rudimentary working of that mystic symbolism?finding in the different parts of the material edifice some fitting expression of spiritual truth?which in the middle ages was reduced to a system and carried to an excess of absurd refinement.*}" But it is to the rise of a religious architecture in the West, that our attention is more immediately called. And . here it is material to remark, that from the age of Con stantine, the fundamental type and ground-plan of the Christian Church, from which it has never deviated through all subsequent periods of architectural develop ment, were determined by the internal arrangement of the Roman Basilica. The Basilic? were large halls, answering the double purpose of an emporium or exchange and a court of justice, which appear to have been commonly erected in the cities of the West (remains of them are found in Her culaneum and Pompeii), and were often placed in the forum.J Their usual shape was an oblong of length con siderably exceeding the breadth. The main entrance from the street was at one end; and down each side of the length of the buildiug were rows of columns, separating the side aisles, which were roofed over, from the central space that was hyp thral, or open to the sky. This centre was thronged with buyers; while the sellers exposed their wares under shelter within the columns. The further end, opposite the entrance, raised above the general level, and approached by a flight of steps, terminated in an apsis, or semicircular niche, vaulted over with a half cupola, within \ which was the tribunal of the magistrate. From an eleva tion of this construction, he could easily be seen and heard from all parts of the edifice. Underneath was a subter ranean chamber for the detention of the parties that were to be brought up for examination. Above the lateral colonnades galleries were sometimes erected?the columns being carried up from below to the roof ; and between the .&gt; columns, in front of the gallery, ran a balustrade?over which persons could look down on the busy scene beneath, or, drawing near to the further end, observe what was going * E?sebius distinctly likens Constantine to Solomon. t See tbe Rationale of Durandus, written in the latter part of the thirteenth century. Eusebius, with an anticipation of this spirit, com pares the material temple with the inward and spiritual temple of the human heart?the ruin and renovation of tbe one with, the ruin and renovation of the other?and its succession of parts from the outer J&amp; gate to the Apsis at the end of the choir, with the different stages of y&amp; the Christian life. t Kinkel has given a very lucid description of them, pp. 51+-61. The name seems to have been imported from Athens, where the court at the foot of the Pnyx, in which the Archon Basileus presided, and took cognizance of offences against the state religion, was called Basilica. In this court Socrates was arraigned.</page><page sequence="4">328_THE OBAYON._ on in Court?while merchants and others could withdraw to this upper part for more retired conference. Such in its general plan was the Roman Basilica, modified occasionally in its details?as, for instance, where an apsis was placed at each end. In the reign of Constantine and afterward, buildings of this sort, no longer perhaps?in consequence of the change of government and manners?required for their original purpose, appear to have been assigned to the Christians as churches; and the style of construction being once fixed, was perpetuated when new edifices were raised.* The nature of the adaptation is well marked by Kinkel.f In the terminating apsis, elevated above the level of the rest of the building, the bishop's throne took the place of the magistrate's chair, and around him, where the judicial assessors once sat, were ranged the presbytery?the altar occupying the centre between them. On the steps where the lictors had kept order, the deacons were now busy; and the bones of martyrs were religiously preserved in the crypt, where in their lifetime the martyrs themselves had awaited the sentence of blood. In the central nave, now covered in and lighted from the windows of the walls, in the side aisles and in the galleries?were dispersed the various members of the congregation, separated from the clergy, as the buyers and sellers of a former time from the seat of magistracy, by an interposed barrier of lattice work. This was the embryo and nascent type of Christian archi tecture. The feature should be noticed, by which, from its origin, it was distinguished from the Greek and Roman temple. The columns were transferred from the exterior to the interior of the building; the inclosing wall was turned, as it were, inward; and the peristyle of the heathen sanctuary became the aisle of the Christian church. Upon this fun damental plan, altogether of heathen origin, Christian ideas gradually exerted a modifying influence. At the point where the choir, or raised platform for the clergy, meets the nave?projections began to shoot out on each side, which expanded at length into a regular transept, and imparted to the edifice the form of a cross. This addition, with the substitution of round arches springing from column to column, in place of the horizontal architrave which at first rested on them?completed the development of the early Roman Basilica. In Constantinople, where a more Oriental taste prevailed, a new architectural element was introduced. The inter section of the transept, with the nave and choir, was sur mounted by a cupola.J This form, of which a model had * This seems the most natural explanation of the adaptation of the name and form to a Christian church. But it is remarkable, that only one example exists of the actual conversion of a secular Basilica into a church (Quarterly Review, vol. lxxv. p. 368). The rage for erecting churches over the supposed graves of martyrs from the fourth century downward, led" to the removal and dismemberment of the primitive Basilic?. t Kinkel, Gesch. der bild. Kunst, p. 61. I The form of the Greek cross (of which it is hardly necessary to been furnished by the Pantheon at Rome, became, with its various modifications and accompaniments, the distinctive feature of the Byzantine style, which reached its highest point of development in the church of St. Sophia, erected by Jus tinian at Constantinople, in the sixth century. Superior technical skill, a tradition of better times, was required for the perfection of this style; but in general the higher qua lities of art were replaced by richness of material and elaborateness of workmanship. Yariegated marbles, inlaid work, gold and silver, precious stones?were lavished with unsparing hand on the interior of the churches. A certain compact centralization, connecting an expanded system of members in graduated subordination with the crowning dome, presents a strong contrast, in this style, to the longi tudinal plainness and simplicity of the Roman Basilica. Although the features which distinguished the Byzantine and the Roman styles were in time thus broadly distin guished, the separation did not take place at once, and the links of transition may be noticed from one to the other. The Basilica furnished the predominant type even in Con stantinople till the time of Justinian, who still retained occa I sionally in his new edifices some elements of the earlier style. In the old churches of Ravenna, which was the seat of the Exarch and medium of communication between Italy and the Greek empire, specimens yet exist of the Basilica, as modified by Byzantine influence. Its general arrangement does not differ materially from the Roman, but is marked by greater regularity in the distribution of its parts, and by the absence of a transept. The only point in which it conforms to the western more than to the eastern type, is in the omission of galleries over the side aisles.* Another form, quite different from those already men tioned?polygonal or circular?was adopted for sepulchral chapels and baptisteries. Of buildings for both these pur poses, models already existed in heathen times: of the former, a specimen still subsists in the tomb of Csecilia Metella; of the latter, in a swimming bath once attached to the Thermae of Diocletian, and now the baptistery of a Christian church. These buildings were often crowned with the cupola. In the ancient church there' were ordinarily remark, that the four limbs are equal) distinguishes in general the ground-plan of the Byzantine churches from that of the Latin. The Byzantine style was chiefly developed by Oriental artists. The archi tects of Constantino and the two Justinians came out of Asia Minor and the still remoter East. Owing to the wide-spread influence of Greek civilization, the Arabs adopted the cupola with its associated features and carried it with them, as an ornament of their morques, into the different countries which they conquered. In still subsisting remains of the old Armenian churches, the Byzantine type is plainly discernible. See Hope'8 Historical Essay on Architecture ; also Kinkel, pp. 125 and 135. * Kinkel, p. 107. In the Greek churches the galleries were set apart for the women. Kinkel observes, that the absence of this pro vision indicates the greater freedom of intercourse between the sexes, which prevailed in the West. This remark must be taken with some limitation ; since?anciently at least?the males and females were as carefully separated in the western as in the eastern churches. See Bingham, Orig. Eccles. B. VIII. ch. v. sect. 6.</page><page sequence="5">_THE CBAYON._329 great public baptisms on the vigils of Epiphauy, Easter and Whitsuntide; and to accommodate the nnmbers assem bled on such occasions, buildings of considerable size were erected, disjoined from the church, and often placed at the western door of cathedrals?as if to express symbolically, that baptism was the appointed means of admission into the Church. The circular form was afterward employed in parochial and other churches. In this style Charlemagne built the chapel attached to his palace. Part at least of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem appears to have been circular;* and the reverence with which it was viewed by pilgrims, may have contributed to diffuse this taste over Europe. Round churches were frequently erected by the knights Templars. For the construction of churches during this early period of Christian architecture, the remains of heathen art were recklessly despoiled. Columns were transferred from the an cient temples to the aisles of a Basilica, without the slightest regard to uniformity of order or harmony of design. Yet in spite of the plain flatness and breadth of their exterior, and the incongruous mixture of elements which serve for their decoration within?the uniformity of general arrange ment and the distinct expression of a steady purpose and clear conception, gave an earnestness and solemnity of character to the primitive churches, which deeply affected the mind. Let us attempt to picture to ourselves an old Christian church, as it must have appeared on some high festival in the fourth or fifth century. We approach the western gate from the street ;f and entering, find ourselves in a spacious quadrangle with cloisters on the four sides. In the centre is a fountain. Scattered around are graves and the monuments of the dead. In one part we observe the excommunicated, doing penance for their sius beneath the open sky; in another, the unhappy energumens or insane, exciting the compassion and prompting the intercessions of the congregation as they pass on to their devotions. Right before us, in the opposite side of the quadrangle, is the door into the narthex, or first division of the church, shel tered by a curtain, around which is assembled a crowd of the lame and blind, and sick and poor, imploring alms. We lift up the curtain, and enter; and within we find collected penitents and infidels, listening to the service, but not ven turing into the nave, which is fenced off from them. Moving on through these, we cross the sacred threshold, and step along the tessellated pavement of the nave. What a scene * Kinkel, p. ] 15. t The usual position of churches was from west to east ; the altar being at the east end, the entrance at the west. But there were fre quent exceptions to this rule, especially in western Christendom. In the middle ages, the line of the church was sometimes directed to that point of the horizon, where the sun rose on the feast of the patron saint. (Durandus on tbe Symbolism of the Churches, English transi, p. 21, n. 17.) Bingham (VIII. iii. 2) supposes that the entrance to the Church of Paulinus at Tyre was on the east. It seems to us that . the words of Eusebius may admit of a different interpretation. Eccles. Hist. x. 2. is herel Through a long vista of columns, from which spring rounded arches that sustain the walls of the roof? with aisles, stretching parallel to them on either side?we look to the triumphal arch which terminates it, admitting a view of the sanctuary beyond, and on a transverse beam exhibiting tbe symbol of the cross. The middle of the nave is thronged with neophytes, not yet admitted to the holy eucharist, who?we observe?as they enter, prostrate them selves on the rota, a large circle of porphyry in front of the centre gate; while the faithful are arranged in the two aisles?the men on the south reverently bowing their bared heads at the Holy Name, and simultaneously ejaculating the deep response?the women on the north, silent and modestly hooded, screened from view within their latticed stalls. Projecting in front of the triumphal arch?closed in with a delicately-wrought balustrade, and elevated by steps above the level of the nave?is the choir. Here are the singers, engaged in chanting the service. To the right of the altar is an ambo, or stone-pulpit, from which the minister, having read the Gospel and the public prayers, is proceeding to address the people; on the left, correspond ing to it, is another?in which sits a deacon, who has already recited the epistle for the day.* Within the tri umphal arch is the ciborium, canopying with its decorated cupola the altar, on which stands the gold and silver vessels ?now covered up from the sight of the novitiates?con taining the consecrated elements of bread and wine.

The German nations who overran the empire of the West, adopted this style, and preserved it in its essential features, till the twelfth century. The form of the Basilica, modified occasionally by Byzantine elements, predominated during the whole of this period, in France and on the Rhine, and penetrated into Britain. To the same traditional type Charlemagne adhered in the churches erected by him at Aix-la-Chapelle and in other places. His age, indeed, shone rather with the last expiring rays of Roman, than with the rising beams of medieval art. As the Lombards, through their ramified commercial connections, exercised great influence beyond the Alps, and the principal architects came out of Italy during their dominion in that country? some writers have called the transition style which spread over the south of France and the western part of Germany, from the seventh and eighth centuries to the twelfth, Lom bardic.f It has, perhaps, more appropriately been desig nated Romanesque.J Old authors who speak of churches erected in Britain in the seventh, eighth, aud ninth cen turies, call them Basilicas, and describe their style and construction as Roman.? The people who made the most rapid advance in the arts of life in the north of Europe, were the Normans; and the old Basilican style of church building which they found already prevalent in the lands conquered by them, they * Kinkel, p. 214. K?gler's History of Painting, Book I. ? vii. Gaily Knight's Ecclesiastical Architecture of Italy. Introduction. t Hope, Historical Esaay on Architecture. Lord Lindsay distin guishes between an earlier and a later style of Lombard Architecture. Mr. Gaily Knight asserts, that the French churches can in no sense be designated Lombardic, but exhibit another modification of the primitive Roman style. (Introd.) Indeed, the historical process will be best understood by the general remark, that the transition styles of the West, preceding the pointed, are all different modifications of the Roman, mingled occasionally with Byzantine elements. \ See Remarks on Church Architecture, by the Rev. J. L. Petit. 2 vols. London, 1841. $ See the passages from Bede and others, quoted in the Rev. J. Bentham's Remarks on Saxon Churches, in his History of the Cathe dral of Ely. Sect. 5. Rickman (Architecture, 4th edit.) says that the Basilica of San Paolo, built outside the walls of Rome, and ascribed to Constantino, resembles a Norman building, and that the Norman zig-zag is discoverable in the buildings of Diocletian. Compare the windows and arcades in the palace of Theodoric, at Ravenna. They we ouite Norman. Gaily Knight, Plate VII. expanded and improved, without abandoning the original type, by superior workmanship, larger dimensions aud richer decorations.* The transept, often wanting in the earlier structures, they generally added to their churches; and over its intersection with the nave, where the Byzan tine cupola was commonly set, they placed a low, square, massive tower for the reception of bells?giving by its in cumbent weight, increased strength and solidity to the entire fabric.f It is obvious, that the changes introduced by the Normans, were a natural growth out of the ear lier style. To the same principle of gradual internal development, and not to any new idea suddenly taking possession of the mind, we must ascribe the next and more important change ?the introduction of the pointed or ogival style. The in genious theories that have been devised by Warburton, Hall, and Murphy, to account for its origin, appearj to us all equally unsatisfactory. When an art is a subject of deep interest, it is not always necessary to look beyond' itself for the sources of the change of style and taste which it successively undergoes. We may often perceive, that some element, latent in it, and harmonizing with the spirit of co-existent circumstances, has been called forth, as well by the desire of novelty, as by the perception of propriety and beauty, which precludes the necessity of referring to positive invention, or of supposing direct importation from a distant quarter.? After the lapse of the first thousand years from the birth of Christ, a new influence passed over the mind of Europe, and medieval civilization began to assume form and consistency. The Christian hierarchy now acquired its greatest strength and influence. The intelligence that directed society was wielded by the church. The monastic orders became rich and powerful. Universities were founded, and soon thronged by thousands. Scholastic learning was reduced to a system, and cultivated with zeal. Municipal rights were secured. Trades were incorporated. Commerce flourished. Wealth produced its natural effects. In the bosom of these quickening influences, the pointed style?a fitting expression of the genius of the time, shot up and rapidly blossomed into perfection. Height, aspiration toward heaven, towering preeminence over earth,were ideas that mingled deeply and worked powerfully in the sacerdotal enthusiasm of the period; and combining with some obvi ous necessities of climate, || would naturally suggest an * Mr. Gaily Knight has shown that they employed the pointed style in Sicily before it was used on the continent of Europe.

In the church of St. Cross, near Win chester, built in the reign of Stephen, which Dr. Milner calls " a collection of architectural essays," the two styles may be seen combined.f The same union is said to be observ able in the west front of the Temple church, built in the time of Henry II. In some cases we can even trace the transition in progress. In the remains of the old church under the choir at York, referred to the same period, Mr. Bentham has remarked, that the arches, springing from short round pillars, are only just pointed.J In England, the new style appears to have superseded the old, in the course of Henry the Third's reign. If Hope be correct in his notion, that the Arabs borrowed their architecture from the Byzantine or East Roman, the appearance of the horse Bhoe arch in Moorish buildings would seem to indicate a development of the same innate tendency toward loftiness and lightness in this remote ramification of the primal type, as is announced by the pointed arch of the north of Europe.? The rapid and almost simultaneous development of the pointed style in the countries where it flourished, must be ascribed in part to the zeal, the close union, and the con nected operation of the various members of the hierarchy, many of whom were accomplished architects and designed the churches erected under their inspection ; but still more to the existence of an immense corporation of masons, in vested with peculiar privileges and placed under the imme diate protection of the Holy See, who worked in concert according to esoteric rules and the principles of an hereditary craft or mystery; and, migrating from place to place, under the conduct of a chief or captain, wherever their skill and labor were required, encamped in the vicinity, till their task * See an article in the Annales Arch? ologique?, De la Construction des Edifices Religieux. The same estimate of the pointed style is ascribed to Wren in the Parentalia. t Milner on the Rise and Progress of the Pointed Arch. ? Remarks on Saxon Churches, p. 77.

On the whole, it seems most probable that it first acquired a fixed and distinctive character in the north of France.f It is admitted by Mr. Gaily Knight, that in the changes of architectural taste, France took precedence of England. This was natural from the political relation of the two countries. Our early Norman kings were the patrons of French, far more than of English, literature and art; and it was in perfect accordance with such circumstances, that Norman artists should' be the first to cultivate and diffuse the new style. The cathedrals of Canterbury, Bologna, Prague, Antwerp, and Upsal were wholly or in part their work. Even in the neighborhood of the Rhine, where the ogival style had more difficulty in establishing itself, and to a late period was resisted by the old Roman, there is evidence that French builders were occasionally employedj. These, however, did not maintain their early superiority. The wars which devastated France in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, arrested the progress of architecture; and English and German builders acquired the celebrity which the French had previously enjoyed. The Italians, at the time of the " Renaissance," who were acquainted with this style only as the production of German hands, called it from them, Tedesco.% The ogival style, in its perfected state?toweriDg pyra midally in a connected system of members from the broad base to the finial of the centre spire?with its aisles and lateral chapels, supporting the main body of the edifice? , with its tall, clustered shafts, its lofty arches, its high vaulted roofs, its flying buttresses and its tapering pinnacles * These were the Free Masons. There is an account of them by Wren, who, at a later period, was one of their society in the Parentalia. Compare also Hope's Historical Essay. The navigators of our modern railway system exhibit some resemblance to them ; but unfortunately they are not under the same good discipline. t In the district?of which Paris forms the geographical centre called by Verneilh {Origine Fran?aise de VArchitecture Ogivale.

Itais a coincidence, not to be overlooked, that the development of the German Bchool of painting from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century corresponds to that of the pointed style in architecture ; and that both appear to have originated in the northern part of France.?See K?gler's Hist, of Painting, Part II. p. 32. % Verneilh affirms, that there are many churches in the valley of the Rhine built in the Roman style, which are not anterior to the thirteenth century. The church of St. Elizabeth, at Marburg, the old--., est uniform specimen of the pointed style in Germany, was not com pleted in 1314. (Lange's Malerische Ansichten der Monumenten der Gothischen Baukunst, etc., p. 23.) Salisbury Cathedral, an uniform structure in the correspondent style, was finished in 1258 (Bentham). ? Verneilh. (Annal. Arch?ol.) When the taste for the pure clas sical arose, the old Christian architecture was designated contemptu ously Gothic; the old Basilican style, with the round arch being dis tinguished as Gotico-Lombardo; the pointed, as Grolico-Tedesco, or, with another theory of its origin, as G?tico-Arabo.?See Hope. .</page><page sequence="8">383_THE CBAYON._ ?all, in the airy lightness of their structure and the delicacy of their workmanship, attenuating themselves, as it were, with a refined spiritualism, out of the heavy massiveness of earlier forms?its front guarded by tabernacled saints, countenances of strange mien looking down from every ! projecting corbel table?its receding doorways curi ously wrought with mystic sculptures, and the wondrous legends of sacred story gleaming forth in rich hues be tween the graceful tracery of its windows?may be taken as a visible symbol?an embodiment in stone and glass?of the spirit of the medieval hierarchy, with its ranks and its orders, its multifarious traditions, its rites and practices of various origin and authority, pervaded by a common aim and aspiration, subordinated to one great purpose of spirit ual domination, and terminating in the final unity of the papal throne. When an art has reached a given point of excellence in one direction?if it do not find some new idea to work upon, or evolve some fresh principle of internal develop ment?it must of necessity decline. Unless it be abso lutely stereotyped, the mere effort, after higher perfection will corrupt it. Di?c?is in perfecto mora est : naturali terque, quod proceder? non protest, recedit. The capabilities of this style were now exhausted. Before the close of the fifteenth century, we perceive a tendency to revert from the perpendicular structure, in which such consummate beanty had been attained, to the horizontal line. Further progress, moreover, was checked by the two most powerful impulses of the age?the revival of classical studies within the church itself, and the movement of reformation external to it. A transition period ensued, marked by a style, which aimed at combining pure Greek and Roman elements with the forms and general effect of medieval architecture, and which has been called, from the century when it flou rished, Cinquecento. The strong reaction in favor of the Catholic hierarchy, of which the followers of Loyola were the most effective instruments, could not bring back the undoubting enthusiasm and deep consciousness of spiritual power, in which the inspiration of the pointed style had its source. The policy of the Jesuits was cautious and calcu lating, and involved concession to the necessities of the times. Their churches wanted the noble simplicity and grandeur of the ancient edifices, and were often showy and meretricious. The progress of refinement in the most culti vated nations of Europe, produced an increasing reverence for classical models, and a proportionate contempt for every style that was vaguely distinguished from them as Gothic. This feeling is very conspicuous about the time of our own Revolution. Addisou's letters are full of it. It swayed powerfully the noble mind of Wren, equally imbued with the spirit of exact science and an admiration of classical simplicity, and hindered him from appreciating the lofty design and picturesque richness of effect, so characteristic of the old ecclesiastical style. In the course of the eigh teenth century, the taste for medieval architecture, or the Gothic, as it was then generally called, revived. Warbur ton and Thomas Warton?to omit other names?afford evident proof of it in their writings. At present, the venera tion for every monument of the middle ages has become a passion?we might truly say, a folly. With all this, we have no architecture of our own. Creation and genius seem gone. We take our models from the remains of classical antiquity, or from buildings of the medieval period; aud out of these we contrive to meet our wants and satisfy our taste. But in this beautiful art, tbe religious spirit of the nineteenth century is without a symbol and a represen tative. Repiinted by request from the " Prospective Review."
