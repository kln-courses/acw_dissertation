Variable chromosomal pairs were coded as Mendelian genotypes and statistically summarized by several clustering and population-genetic algorithms. UPGMA dendrograms were used to group all samples from pairwise genetic distance or similarity matrices, and consistently identified seven discrete groups. These findings confirm and extend results of an earlier population cytogenetics study and provide data necessary to complete distributional maps for some cytotypes. The fine resolution collecting and mapping efforts revealed several additional zones of parapatric hybridization between different cytotypes and brings the total number of hybrid zones identified from chromosomal markers to seven. Several other populations are highly polymorphic for chro- mosomal rearrangements and occur at or near the edges of ranges of particular cytotypes; this suggests that they may represent additional hybrid zones. These populations also contain high frequencies of apparent fusion rearrangements, which are very rare or absent elsewhere, and we suggest that these mutations may be manifestations of the dysgenic effects of hybridization. Population-genetic structures were estimated for all cytotypes on the basis of the distributions and frequencies of chromosomal rearrangements. A hierarchical F statistics analysis showed that most of the overall chromosomal variation could be partitioned into the within-cytotype component (67%) relative to that between cytotypes (33%). Inbreeding coefficients show that most samples do not deviate significantly from random-mating proportions, and in the few cases where they do, the direction is always toward heterozygote excess. Some cytotypes show significant between-sample heterogeneity in chromosomal rearrangement frequencies, and spatial autocorrelation analyses produced correlograms suggesting an isolation-by-distance structure for some cytotypes, and a random pattern in others in which drift was probably the overriding force. Patterns of chromosomal variation and inferred population structure are discussed with respect to implications for several hypotheses of chromosomal evolution and speciation. Key words: Lacertilia; Sceloporus grammicus; Chromosomal rearrangements; Meiotic pairing; Hybrid zones; Population structure; F statistics; Hardy-Weinberg ratios; Hierarchical analysis; Spatial autocorrelation; Speciation THE IGUANID lizard Sceloporus gram- micus (Phrynosomatidae according to Frost and Etheridge, 1989) has been the basis for several evolutionary studies be- cause of its high chromosomal polytypy (Hall, 1973, 1980; Hall and Selander, 1973; Porter and Sites, 1986; Sites, 1983). This complex exhibits a level of chromosomal polytypy unsurpassed by any other non- mammalian vertebrate. Because these liz- ards are generally abundant, conspicuous, and easy to collect, they offer a superb resource for investigating questions deal- ing with the interplay of population struc- ture, the mutational origin and fixation of new chromosomal rearrangements, and the possible role of such rearrangements in speciation. This is also true for some other organisms (reviewed in Sites and Moritz, 1987), but unlike almost all other cases of presumed chromosomal evolution or spe- ciation "in progress," the S. grammicus complex exhibits extensive within-popu- lation polymorphism as well as between- population fixation for the same classes of rearrangements (mostly Robertsonian fis- sions). This suggests that processes relevant to the origin, spread, and fixation of new chromosomal mutations may still be ac- tively occurring in this group. This paper continues a series of studies focused on determining: 1) why these events are oc- 79</page><page sequence="2">80 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 curring in S. grammicus; and 2) what the evolutionary consequences of the exten- sive chromosomal diversification might be. Hall (1973, 1980) originally described seven S. grammicus chromosome races (cytotypes) presumably forming a linear sequence of fixed Robertsonian mutations of the macrochromosome pairs; these mu- tations produced diploid numbers ranging from 2N = 329 to 469. The ancestral cy- totype hypothesized to be the race known as Standard (S; Hall, 1973) is characterized by six pairs of meta- or submetacentric macrochromosomes and 196 or 209 micro- chromosomes. Microchromosal differ- ences between sexes of all members of this complex are due to the presence of an XiX2Y/XiX1X2X2 sex chromosome system (see Cole et al., 1967). The other six cy- totypes recognized by Hall were identified by different numbers of fixed or polymor- phic macrochromosomal fissions: cytotype P1, polymorphic for a fission of pair 1 (2N = 32-349); cytotype F5, fixed for a fission for chromosome pair 5 (2N = 349); cyto- type F6 fixed for pair 6 fission (also with 2N = 349); cytotype F5+6 with fissions for pairs 5 and 6 (2N = 369); and two different multiple fission cytotypes known as FM- FM1, fixed for fissions for 2, 3, 5 and 6 and polymorphic for pairs 4 and 1, (2N = 40-449), and FM2, fixed for fissions for all macrochromosomes except pair 4 and hav- ing an extra pair of microchromosomes (2N = 44-469). Distributional data for these races are given in Sites et al. (1987). Some of these cytotypes have been formally named and may represent valid species (Lara-Gongora, 1983; Sites et al., 1988), but until these races are verified we will refer to all population in this paper by cytotype designations of "Sceloporus grammicus." Porter and Sites (1986) carried out a populational cytogenetics survey on a por- tion of this complex confined to a relatively small geographic area in central Mexico. This region was chosen because Hall had previously reported both relatively high levels of within-sample Robertsonian poly- morphism, and the presence of three dif- ferent regions of parapatric hybridization (Hall, 1973,1980; Hall and Selander, 1973). Despite his extensive sampling, Hall missed many important areas in central Mexico, and the distributions of most of the cyto- types remained incompletely known. Por- ter and Sites (1986) scored karyotypes from 597 lizards collected from 42 localities (see Porter and Sites, 1986:fig. 1) to map the distributions of chromosome races in this region. They identified 45 different karyo- types among the 597 lizards scored, but when coded by genotypes, these karyo- types grouped into seven distinct cyto- types. Some of these did not corresponded to Hall's earlier identifications and distri- butional data, and the data reported by Porter and Sites (1986) revealed three oth- er phenomena unanticipated from Hall's earlier work. First, the F5+6 cytotype showed great- er within-sample chromosomal poly- morphism than originally described by Hall (see also Porter and Sites, 1985). Sec- ond, Porter and Sites (1986) reported the presence of an "F5" (2N = 34) cytotype identified from a total of seven individuals collected from two localities NE of Mexico City (Porter and Sites, 1986:fig. 1, samples 11, 12). This race was previously known (Hall, 1973) from only 10 individuals from two localities in northwestern Chihuahua (see map in Sites et al., 1987) almost 1000 km northwest of the central Mexico local- ities. Third, Porter and Sites (1986) iden- tified another "multiple fission" or FM cy- totype from a single locality not collected by Hall. This FM3 race (n = 22 specimens) is characterized by fixed fissions of macro- chromosome pairs 2, 5, and 6 and is poly- morphic for fissions at macrochromsome pairs 1 and 4. These fissions yield a 2N = 389 karyotype (when pairs 1 and 4 are fixed metacentric), hypothetically placing this cytotype phylogenetically intermedi- ate between the F5+6 and more derived FM races (see Sites and Davis, 1989:fig. 1). Porter and Sites (1986) recognized Hall's P1 cytotype as a polymorphic population of the S race. Subsequently, the S cytotype has been recognized as two distinct cyto- types, the high- and low-elevation S (Sites et al., 1988; Sites and Davis, 1989). The high-elevation S cytotype includes Hall's (1973, 1980) "PI" cytotype as well as a number of chromosomally monomorphic populations. The high-S cytotype appears HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 80</page><page sequence="3">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 81 to consist of a number of small populations, each isolated at the highest elevations on mountain peaks in central Mexico. Porter and Sites (1986) also reported a possible case of monobrachial fusion in- volving macrochromosomal pairs 5 and 6 and provided meiotic evidence for the pos- sibility of reciprocal translocation hetero- zygosity between different sized acrocen- tric pairs (1986:fig. 7A, F, respectively). These kinds of rearrangements, each doc- umented from only a single individual, may have fundamentally different meiotic and evolutionary consequences than the Robertsonian polymorphisms commonly associated with some S. grammicus cyto- types (see general reviews by Sites and Mo- ritz, 1987; Searle, 1988). Field work during the summer of 1986 provided samples from many additional localities in central Mexico and more than doubled the number of lizard karyotypes from the same region. This paper extends the work of Porter and Sites (1986) to a more fine-scale geographic sampling effort and uses chromosomal rearrangements to analyze population structure and chro- mosomal differentiation (e.g., Craddock and Carson, 1989). There were four spe- cific objectives. The first was to more thor- oughly map the geographical distribution of the central Mexico cytotypes, especially the poorly sampled F5 and FM3 races. The mapped distributions of these cytotypes will allow us to establish their spatial relationships and locate other possible parapatric contacts in cases where chro- mosomal rearrangements allow the iden- tification of hybrids. The second was to describe and illustrate new karyotypic var- iants and to estimate their frequencies and distributions. The third was to improve the estimates of frequencies and distributions of known within-sample chromosomal polymorphisms and compare these to Har- dy-Weinberg expectations, testing for strong selection against chromosomal het- erozygotes (e.g., Nachman and Myers, 1989). The fourth objective was to use pol- ymorphisms at certain macrochromosome pairs to test for spatial autocorrelation and isolation by distance for identical rear- rangements across samples within chro- mosome races. This quantitative analysis of population structure on the basis of chromosomal markers will provide infor- mation for later studies at independent levels of organization (morphological, pro- tein, ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA) in this complex. The eventual incorpora- tion of multiple data sets collected from the same animals will permit the evalua- tion of patterns of geographic concordance among these different levels, the indepen- dent definition of distinct evolutionary units within the S. grammicus complex, and the identification of useful molecular markers for ongoing phylogenetic and hy- brid zone studies (see also Sites et al., 1988; Sites and Davis, 1989). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area and sampling.-During the summer of 1986, 786 lizards were collect- ed from 55 different localities in central Mexico, covering parts of six different states. Some of these localities had been sampled earlier, but the new collections more than doubled the number of locali- ties and lizards sampled by Porter and Sites (1986). With these additional collections, a total of 1383 lizards have been scored for karyotypes from 93 localities. Figure 1 shows the geographic location of all sam- pling sites, and the localities and sample sizes are in the Appendix. Not included in these totals are 195 lizards from 9 localities along two different hybrid zone transects that will be reported in later papers. All lizards were captured either by hand, noose, or by stunning with rubber bands. Each live lizard was processed for chro- mosomal data (see below), and tissues were taken for allozyme and DNA analysis, usu- ally within 24-48 h of capture. All indi- viduals (except near-term embryos taken from gravid females, which were frozen in liquid nitrogen as whole body samples) were prepared as voucher specimens and catalogued in one of the following collec- tions: M.

Preparation and interpretation of karyotypes.-Standard karyotypes were obtained from bone marrow and in repro- ductively active males, meiotic material 82 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="5">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 83 was collected from testicular tissue follow- ing procedures described by Porter and Sites (1986). After sacrifice, samples of liv- er, kidney, heart, brain and skeletal muscle were frozen immediately in liquid nitro- gen for future molecular studies. The chro- mosome preparations were stained with conventional Giemsa staining techniques to visualize chromosomes. The slides were scanned on a Zeiss Photomicroscope II to find at least 5 cells (in most cases) for each lizard, and any new or different karyo- types were photographed with Kodak Technical Pan (2415) film. Each karyotype (based on five cells in most cases) was scored according to a slightly modified version of the macro- chromosomal code devised by Porter and Sites (1986). For this study we extended the number of possible genotypes to in- clude new rearrangements found within the additional material (Fig. 2). A nonfis- sioned pair is scored as AA; a fission het- erozygote as AB, inversions variously as AC, BD, or BE, depending upon whether the inversion occurred in the original metacentric (C) or one or two acrocentrics (D and E, respectively) derived from ear- lier fissions. The latter classes of mutations (D and E) produce secondary metacen- trics. The letter F coded a presumed fusion between two acrocentrics from different macrochromosome pairs such as a 5 with a 6, and G denoted fixation of the rear- rangement identified by F. The last code, H symbolized an acrocentric macrochro- mosome (pair 5?) fusion with a micro- chromosome. The microchromosomes are also considered in the analysis, with AA representing the ancestral set (19$ 209) and BB corresponding to the set with an extra pair in the FM2 cytotype (216 229; see Porter and Sites, 1986). All karyotypes were scored assuming the minimum number of rearrangements, and when possible, con- firmed from examination of the diakinesis arrays in meiotic karyotypes (Porter and Sites, 1985, 1987). However, the Giemsa stain does not allow us to unequivocally infer arm homology between karyotypes, and without observations of meiotic pair- ing behavior from the same individuals, some scores must be considered tentative.

The coded genotypes were then ana- lyzed by several population-genetic rou- tines of the BIOSYS-1 program of Swof- ford and Selander (1981). First, the frequencies of all chromosomal rearrange- ments were calculated for all samples, and these frequencies were then used to cal- culate genetic distance coefficients (Rog- ers, 1972; Nei 1972, 1978) among all pair- wise sample comparisons. All matrices were then clustered by the UPGMA (Sneath and Sokal, 1973) subroutine to group samples by overall cytogenetic similarity or dis- tance (see Porter and Sites, 1986). An up- dated distribution map of all cytotypes was then prepared from the groupings evident in the UPGMA dendrograms. Chromo- somal frequencies were also used to esti- mate the average heterozygosity expected over all chromosome pairs (H), using the unbiased estimate of Nei (1978) and the proportion of chromosome pairs polymor- phic (P, 0.95 criterion) for each sample. Additional analyses were carried out to partition the overall degree of chromosom- al variation into within- vs. between-cy- 1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 83</page><page sequence="6">84 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [Nn. 5 totype components using hierarchical F statistics (Wright, 1965, 1978) with the fol- lowing modifications. Populations sam- pled from each locality were treated as panmictic demes (D) within cytotypes (C), within the total (T) S. grammicus popu- lation in central Mexico. Fixation indices were defined as: FDT, the variance in chro- mosomal rearrangement frequency among samples within the total population; FDC, variance among samples within each cy- totype; and FCT, variance among cytotypes within the total S. grammicus complex. These indices are related by the equation (modified from Wright, 1978); (1 - FDT) = (1 - FDC)(1 - FCT). Since the hierarchical partitioning of over- all rearrangement frequency variance had previously been shown to be strongly due to between-cytotype divergence (Porter and Sites, 1986), we focused our primary attention on the FDc and FCT indices. We used the HIERARCHY subroutine in com- bination with the HETXSQ (heterogeneity x2) option (SUBDIV = 1) to evaluate the null hypothesis that FDC = 0. This combi- nation in BIOSYS carries out the contin- gency x2 analysis of Workman and Nis- wander (1970; and using Levene's [1949] correction for small sample sizes) for each previously specified level in the hierarchy (first within- and then between-cytotypes), with significance for departures from 0 for single-locus estimates being evaluated as: 2nFxy(k - 1), with df = (k - 1)(s - 1); where: n = the total number of individuals sampled at the locus, Fxy = the level in the hierarchy (FDC and then FCT in this case), k = the number of alleles (rearrangements) at a locus, and s = the number of popu- lations sampled. An FID (inbreeding index equivalent to Wright's FIs) estimate was calculated for each sample, and the null hypothesis FID = 0 tested for agreement of observed ver- sus expected heterozygote frequencies within each deme. The level of signifi- cance was evaluated by the method of Wa- ples (1987): x2 = FIDn(k - 1); df = k(k - 1)/2, with n and k as defined above. In all x2 tests, classes of rare homozygotes were pooled if the total of either was less than five (Hedrick, 1983:64). Wright's (1951) original detailed eluci- dation of the power of hierarchical F sta- tistics for inferring population structure is based on several assumptions that must be clarified. First, his "fixation indices" (FIs, FIT, and FST) were originally defined in terms of correlations of two uniting ga- metes in an imaginary population of in- finite size. In other words, they were de- fined as population parameters rather than sample estimates of those parameters, and as a consequence, Wright did not concern himself with the effects of finite sample sizes. The genetic markers are also as- sumed to be selectively neutral. This latter assumption may be met by chromosomal rearrangements existing as within-popu- lation polymorphisms in S. grammicus, at least with respect to their meiotic effects in males (Porter and Sites, 1985, 1987), but the population structure may not be equiv- alent to that given in Wright's models. We have therefore utilized an additional F sta- tistic to estimate the same parameters. Weir and Cockerham (1984) developed esti- mators of the Wright F index parameters based on an analysis of variance model that takes error into account. Their estimators are: H, defined as a correlation of allele frequencies of different individuals in the same population; F, a correlation of genes within individuals; and f, a correlation of genes within individuals within popula- tions. The estimators H, F, and f are anal- ogous to Wright's FST, FIT, and FIs indices (Cockerham, 1969, 1973). None of these estimators are dependent upon the sam- pling scheme (number of alleles/locus, number of individuals sampled/popula- tion, or sizes descended from a single an- cestral population that was in both Hardy- Weinberg and linkage equilibrium). We have no way of knowing if these assump- tions are or were met in S. grammicus and, therefore, do not employ these estimators. However, because f is estimated only from allele frequency data within a single sam- ple and makes no assumptions about ex- pected heterozygote frequencies, it was used as a second estimator for FID. At this point, we wished to extend the earlier populational cytogenetic studies of Porter and Sites (1986) by asking whether or not for a given macrochromosome pair, 84 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="7">191 HEPEOLGIA MNORAHS8 the rearrangement frequency at one lo- cation was correlated with the frequency of the same rearrangement at a nearby locality within the same cytotype. Are samples distantly located from each other more divergent in rearrangement fre- quencies than geographically close sam- ples? Heterogeneity of allele frequencies may be demonstrated by contingency x2 analyses, but such tests are not informative with respect to the spatial patterning of these values (Sokal and Oden, 1978b:231). Spatial autocorrelation analyses (described in detail by Sokal and Oden, 1978a,b) were carried out with programs written by R. K. Chesser of the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. These analyses were used to generate correlograms showing changes in autocorrelation along predetermined dis- tance intervals and with significance levels determined by Moran's "I" statistic. "I" can vary from +1 (strong positive auto- correlation) to -1 (strong negative corre- lation), and expected values approach 0 for large sample sizes in the absence of autocorrelation (see biological examples in Karlin et al., 1984; Archie et al., 1985; and Sokal et al., 1986). We have not extensively tested for tem- poral fluctuations in chromosomal rear- rangement frequencies at most of the 93 localities, and readers should know that we are pooling collections made from differ- ent localities at different years. The MCZ material included was prepared by Hall from lizards collected in the early 1970's, whereas our collections span four summers (1983-1986). However, we have data for different samples where collections were made exactly at the same locations in dif- ferent years and plot temporal changes in frequencies of chromosomal rearrange- ments for these samples (see Nachman and Myers, 1989). In no case do we have tem- porally separated large sample sizes from a single locality. Gregorius (1980) has shown that a sample size of at least 51 individuals is required to assure that an allele with a frequency of 0.10 will be de- tected with a probability of 95% and this would be required over a number of years to rigorously test for seasonal fluctuations in chromosome rearrangement frequen- cies.

RESULTS Temporal and Geographic Patterns of Chromosomal Variation Table A in the Appendix summarizes genotype frequencies of all 1383 lizards by their respective localities. At seven lo- calities (55, 57, 69, 77, 78, 85, 89), the frequencies of all rearrangements were calculated for at least two different col- lecting years to assess temporal variation (Fig. 3). The overall pattern appears to reflect slightly random increase or de- crease in frequencies through time. For example, pair 4 fissions were common at all of these localities and increased in fre- quency at some localities (A-D) but de- creased at others (E-G). Perhaps more im- portantly, the same rearrangements are shown to persist at the same localities over a time span of several years (A, B). We statistically evaluated temporal changes in rearrangement frequencies in the pair 1 fission at locality 57 (solid squares in Fig. 3B) using a replicated goodness-of-fit test (G statistic, Sokal and Rohlf, 1981:721- 725). For the five samples from this local- ity, GH = 7.86 with 9 df is not significant (x2.0 = 14.067). We therefore pooled all samples collected in different years from the same localities. The rearrangement frequencies (Ap- pendix: Table A) were used to calculate several matrices of genetic distance and similarity coefficients (e.g., Table 1), and these were all clustered by the UPGMA algorithm of Sneath and Sokal (1973). The dendrograms for the 93 population sam- ples were then used to determine the num- ber of chromosomally distinct groups and their respective distributions, following Porter and Sites (1986). We emphasize that these dendrograms are intended to show overall chromosomal similarity among samples, not their phylogenetic relation- ships. Figure 4 presents the dendrogram of the 93 samples calculated from the Rog- ers (1972) distance matrix and is generally representative of UPGMA tree topologies obtained from other matrices. Some dis- crepancies, however, were evident in the dendrogram of Nei's (1978) distances for samples 69 and 93, and the alternative to- pology is shown as an insert in Fig. 4. All dendrograms unequivocally identify sev- en chromosomally-distinct groups and cor- roborate and extend the earlier findings of Porter and Sites (1986). Samples 69 and 93 are either grouped as extreme outliers within the FM1 cytotype (Fig. 4) or are grouped close to FM1 but at a level of divergence equivalent to that separating other cytotypes (Fig. 4 insert). With these exceptions, the groupings depicted in the Rogers' dendrogram in Fig. 4 are identical to those produced by UPGMA clustering of all other distance matrices calculated in this study. Figure 5 illustrates the geographic re- lationships of the 93 population samples relative to each other and to some of the major topographic features of the Mexican Plateau. Populations of the Standard (S) cytotype, represented by the triangles, are mainly distributed in or near the Valley of Mexico and surrounding peaks. The only samples scored as S outside of this region was a Low-S population in the city of Pa- chuca itself (sample 27), and two HS sam- ples in fir forests at higher elevations in the El Chico region just north and north- west of Pachuca. Sites et al. (1988) have shown that Low- and High-S populations differ from each other by a single fixed or nearly fixed allozyme difference (Ldh-B) in the mountain ranges east and west of Mexico City. Our "High-S" scoring in Fig. 5 is based strictly on the habitat from which FIG. 4.-Dendrogram based on Rogers' genetic distance values for all pairwise comparisons of 93 S. grammicus samples (numbers identify localities, see Appendix and Fig. 1).

In both topologies, the cophenetic correlation values were 0.866 and 0.743, respectively.

This sur- veys extends the number of localities of both S cytotypes in central Mexico from 10, originally reported by Porter and Sites (1986), to 30 (Figs. 4, 5). The distribution of the F6 cytotype is extended from six (Porter and Sites, 1986) HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 88</page><page sequence="11">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 89 to nine localities (Fig. 5, solid circles), mainly restricted to the southern and west- ern edges of the range of the Low-S cy- totype but at higher elevations. The F6 populations are in the mountains forming the eastern divide of the Valley of Mexico (samples 36, 37) and the ranges flanking Mexico City to the south and west (samples 31, 32, 38) and occur at lower elevations than the High-S populations. In other words, they are "sandwiched" between Low- and High-S in these isolated moun- tain ranges (see also Sites et al., 1988). Fur- ther west on Nevado de Toluca (sample 33), F6 appears to be the only cytotype at higher elevations and also the only race present in flatter parts of the Mexican Pla- teau extending west from Nevado de To- luca (samples 34, 35). The isolated popu- lation in northeastern Queretaro (39) may or may not be genetically equivalent to the more southern Plateau and mountain populations; again independent evaluation using protein or DNA markers will be re- quired. Within the study area, the distribution of F5 appears to be restricted to the eastern portion of Hidalgo and adjacent Puebla (Fig. 5, open circles) although much po- tential S. grammicus habitat remains to be sampled to the immediate north and northeast of the described distribution. The two localities reported by Porter and Sites (1986) are here expanded to 11 localities, which cluster together as a distinct group in all dendrograms (Fig. 4). Porter and Sites (1986) identified six lo- calities for the F5+6 cytotype, and since the region of our current field sampling efforts takes in only the very southern edge of this cytotype (see detailed maps in Sites, 1983; Sites et al. 1987), we did not collect any additional samples of this race. How- ever, our scoring methods unexpectedly identified an F5+6 population in south- eastern Hidalgo (locality 56 in Fig. 5), at a juncture of two or three other S. gram- micus cytotypes. The presence of this cy- totype at this locality, over 120 km to the southeast of the nearest known F5+6 pop- ulation, suggests that this sample repre- sents a hybrid or intergrade population be- tween either two or three of these other cytotypes. The highly polymorphic Vizar- ron population (Porter and Sites, 1985; number 57 in Fig. 5) has also been recently re-evaluated with molecular markers (Sites and Davis, 1989) and appears to represent a point of historical contact (F5+6 x FM1), rather than a pure F5+6 population. We identified six populations of the FM3 cytotype, which is confined to a small re- gion just west of the F5 cytotype (as men- tioned above) in southcentral Hidalgo (Fig. 5). However, as with F5, there is a large portion of central Hidalgo from which no S. grammicus have been collected, thus the range defined in Fig. 5 must be con- sidered a minimum. These samples in- crease by five the number reported by Por- ter and Sites (1986) and form a group within the dendrograms distinct from any other cytotype (Fig. 4). The FM1 populations are confined to a small, almost north-south linear range be- tween the F5+6 and the FM2 cytotypes (Fig. 5). Samples 69 and 93 are identified by open rectangles in Fig. 5 to denote their uncertain status. As discussed before, these samples were grouped either with the FM1 samples or as a separate cluster differen- tiated almost to the level of other discrete cytotypes (Fig. 4 insert). Because of their high levels of variability (Table 2, and see below), their geographic separation from each other, and the location of both near or at the edge of the range of the FM2 cytotype (Fig. 5), these samples must also be treated as possible areas of hybridiza- tion or integradation between two (or more?) races. If these two samples are not regarded as FM1, the number of localities for this race is extended from three (Porter and Sites, 1986) to five, with the total geo- graphic range spanning the border from southwestern Hidalgo into northcentral Mexico (Fig. 5). The distinct FM2 cytotype is now known from 23 localities; all confined to a small, oval-shaped area in southern Hidalgo and northern Mexico (Fig. 5). Judging from the number of known or likely contacts with other races, and the fact that FM2 is almost totally surrounded by four other cytotypes (Low-S, F5, FM3, and FM1, beginning on the southern edge of the FM2 range and moving counter-clockwise in Fig. 5), our sampling efforts have probably defined al- most the complete range of this race.

The letters A-G in Fig. 5 show locations of seven hybrid zones between different combinations of S. grammicus cytotypes. The zones correspond to those of Sites and Davis (1989:fig. 2) and are identified by the same letters. The 1986 field sampling identified two new contact zones, in ad- dition to the suspect populations described above (F, G, in Fig. 5). In all cases in Fig. 5, including those reported by Hall (1973), the zones were identified by one or more samples meeting two criteria. First, they included individ- uals heterozygous for one or more chro- mosomal markers at which other samples on the same transect showed fixed differ- ences. Second, the heterozygous samples were located on the transects geographi- cally between the samples showing fixed chromosomal differences. As described above, it is likely that several highly poly- morphic "suspect" samples may represent additional hybrid populations, but we lack the linear sampling points to unequivo- cally establish this. Because of their un- certain status, however, these samples (56, 57, 69, 93 in Fig. 5) were deleted from all further statistical analyses except those es- timating overall variability. Chromosomal data for several samples collected from transects B (F5 x FM2) and F (F6 x High- S) are not included in this study and will form the basis for future reports. Table 1 summarizes a hierarchical anal- ysis among cytotypes using the Nei dis- tance coefficients (1978). The "number of populations" column differs from the total number of samples identified within each cytotype, because chromosomally identi- cal samples were entered as a single sample within any given race (numbers 1-21 of the S race in Appendix: Table A, for ex- ample). As expected, the average distances among samples within any cytotype were lower, often by an order of magnitude, than the average distances between any pair of cytotypes. Table 2 summarizes P and H values for all 93 samples. Most samples of the S cy- totype were monomorphic or nearly so, with H values ranging from 0.0-0.04 (for samples 25 and 30, respectively, and both with P values of 14.3), and H = 0.0047 and P = 1.43 across all 30 samples. The F6 cytotype was almost as monomorphic as S, with P values from 0.0-14.3, and H from 0.0-0.04 (P = 1.59, H = 0.0044). The F5 race was similar, with P values from 0.0-14.3 and a H from 0.0-0.09 (P = 7.8, H = 0.026). The F5+6 samples showed more variability, with values from 0.0- 14.3 for P and from 0.0-0.14 for H, and P = 8.58 and H = 0.044. Note that the two "suspect" populations (56, 57) showed much higher variability: P = 42.9 in both, and H = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively. Not surprisingly, all multiple fission races showed higher values for both P and H: FM3, 14.3-71.4 for P (P = 35.73) and 0.06- 90 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="13">19911 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 91 TABLE 2.-Summary of estimates of the proportion of loci polymorphic (P) and average heterozygosity (H) by locality and cytotype.

Additionally, other local- ities (25-27, Table A) showed fission poly- morphisms in pair 1 at low frequencies. The F6 cytotype scored from 9 localities (31-39) was chromosomally monomorphic in most cases. A single specimen from lo- cality 39 showed an inversion in an acro- centric arm of a fissioned pair 6 (Appendix: Table A) and is illustrated in Porter and Sites (1986:fig. 3K). The 11 samples of the F5 cytotype rep- resent a total of 113 lizards (samples 40- 50, Table A) and show a number of dif- ferent polymorphisms. Figure 6A,B shows karyotypes homozygous and heterozygous for an apparent pericentric inversion of macrochromosome 4. These polymor- phisms were found in sample 47, from which a triploid female lizard (Fig. 6F) was also identified. The 6A karyotype could also be arranged to represent inversion het- erozygosity at pairs 3 and 4 (since these cannot be distinguished on the basis of size or morphology), but since the pair 4 in- version appears in several other localities, we interpret this female as a low frequency homozygote for a single rearrangement. Samples 51-57 represent the F5+6 cy- totype, localities 58-63, the FM3 cytotype. The total sample of FM3 is now 92 lizards, but neither of these races showed poly- morphisms other than those previously re- corded by Porter and Sites (1986). Five different localities are now known for the FM1 cytotype (samples 64-68). Typical for this race, chromosomal poly' morphisms were found at pair 1 (sample 64), pair 4, or in both pairs, at these five localities. The last multiple fission cyto- type, FM2, was identified from 23 popu- lations in which many different combi- nations of polymorphisms were found. However, most of these involved either the pair 4 fission, which is characteristic of all FM2 populations or, less frequently, the pericentric inversion rearrangements de- scribed by Porter and Sites (1986). Samples 69 and 93 are considered sep- arately because of their highly polymor- phic conditions. Both localities were re- ported by Porter and Sites (1986) as either being, or likely to be, polymorphic, but these inferences were based on sample siz- es of 11 and one, respectively. These sam- ples are now 29 and 73 specimens, re- spectively. Within these samples, five individuals in population 69 and 42 in pop- ulation 93 show the presumed fusion de- scribed in Porter and Sites (1986:fig. 7A).

A. Karyotype interpreted to show a three- way monobrachial fusion complex involving two acrocentric arms of pair 5 and one each of pair 6 and a microchromosome pair. This karyotype is also heterozygous for fissions at pairs 1 and 4 and possesses seven rather than eight pairs of microchromosomes in addition to the X1X2Y sex chromosomes (aligned beneath macrochromosomes at left). Meiotic pairing shows two macrochromosomal trivalents, presumably reflecting the end-to-end pairing of pairs 1 and 4 fission heterozygotes; five additional macrochromosomal bivalents presumably correspond to acrocentric elements of pairs 2, 3 and 5; a large multivalent (*) presumably corresponds to "chain" formed by end-to-end pairing of monobrachial fusion heterozygotes; seven micro- chromosomal bivalents and the small sex chromosomal trivalent (identified by "m" and solid circles, respec- tively, in this and all other meiotic configurations; EDHEM 1694).

Karyotypes with two rather than one 5-6 metacentric element in combination with other macrochro- mosomal rearrangements. In all cases where a fission heterozygote appears in the mitotic karyotype, a large trivalent is evident in meiosis (C, E, and F). However, meiotic pairing configurations for each of these is different with respect to the presumed fusion pairs; possible interpretations are diagrammatically illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9 (C, MZFC 4228; D, MZFC 4228; E, MZFC 4229). they had only a single specimen with this rearrangement. They interpreted this chromosome as a fusion between two ac- rocentrics, one each from pairs 5 and 6, but since the lizard showing this karyotype was female, no meiotic data were collect- ed. We identified what appears to be the same fusion in several females (Fig. 6C- E) and also in a number of reproductively active males from which meiotic data were simultaneously collected (Fig. 7). Our samples include different variations of the same rearrangement, including females showing two 5-6 fusions in combination with various other polymorphisms (Fig. 6C-E), and males with either one or two 5-6 fusions in combination with other re- arrangements (Fig. 7B-E). We also found what appears to be a multiple fusion in- volving three different pairs of acrocen- trics in one lizard of sample 69. This is a presumed fusion between acrocentrics of pair 5 and 6, a fusion of another arm of pair 5 with a microchromosome, and a 93 1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS</page><page sequence="16">94 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGR APHS [No 5 non-fissioned (or secondarily re-fused) metacentric 6 (Fig. 7A). Diakinesis arrays showed the formation of two macrochro- mosomal trivalents and a large multiva- lent, and we represent diagrammatically in Fig. 8A our interpretation of both the mitotic and meiotic karyotypes in this in- dividual. This combination of fusions, when present in the genome with two other ac- rocentric members of pair 5, meta- and acrocentric elements of pair 6, and an un- paired microchromosome, would form a large chain multivalent with five chro- mosomes paired end-to-end at diakinesis. The order of pairing would be: micro/ micro+5 submetacentric/5+6 submeta- centric/metacentric 6/acrocentric 6. The two pair 5 acrocentric homologues would then presumably form a bivalent, and the normal number of eight microchromoso- mal bivalents (in all races but FM2) would be reduced to seven. Figure 7 also shows the diakinesis arrays of polymorphisms for less complex rear- rangements. In some cases, large multi- valents are present in meiosis. For exam- ple, the male illustrated in Fig. 7B displayed bivalents for each of the ho- mologous fission products of pairs 1, 2 and 3, a trivalent for the pair 4 fission hetero- zygote, and a smaller presumed 5-6 tri- valent (asterisk in Fig. 7B). The eight smaller bivalents and the trivalent at the far right presumably represent the eight pairs of microchromosomes and the X1X2Y trivalent, respectively. Similar diakinetic configurations are represented in Fig. 7C, E, with the presumed pair 4 trivalent dis- playing complete end-to-end pairing in both, and pair 1 showing the same in Fig. 7E. The large multivalents in each of these are interpreted as compound bivalents or quadrivalents resulting from end-to-end pairing of the double 5+6 fusion complex. Five alternatives are diagrammatically il- lustrated in Fig. 8B, and pairing in either direction could produce a compound bi- valent or quadrivalent at meiosis. Quad- rivalent formation (6/6+5/5+6/6; or 5/5+6/6+5/5) would leave only single bi- valents in diakinesis (5/5 or 6/6, respec- tively). Formation of compound bivalents (6+5/5+6, or 5+6/6+5) would leave the unfused arms of 5 and 6 to pair with their respective homologues, producing one 6/6 and 5/5 bivalent. A fifth possibility could produce three laterally paired bivalents. Figure 9 depicts another possibility in- volving fusions of pair 5 and 6 acrocentrics to opposite homologs. The meiotic out- come of heterozygosity for both of these fusions should yield two different end-to- end paired trivalents. Similar rearrangements appear to have occurred in Fig. 7D,F, but in these cases meiotic pairing appears to have been dis- rupted. For example, no compound bi- valent/quadrivalent is evident in Fig. 7D, and there are several extra smaller biva- lents in this cell. This situation could occur if the 5+6 fusion chromosomes paired lat- erally with each other, so that interstitial chiasmata formed between homologous arms, as shown in the bottom of Fig. 8B. One multivalent (4) is evident in Fig. 7F, but this is probably the trivalent corre- sponding to the heteromorphic pair 4 in the mitotic karyotype. If so, this could again be a case of lateral pairing between the two 5+6 fusion chromosomes, in which case there would be no quadrivalent in meiosis. More complex rearrangements might also be responsible for the pairing behavior observed in these individuals, but the diagrammatic representations depict the most parsimonious interpretations. Statistical Summary of Population Structure: Hierarchical Analysis Table 3 shows the hierarchical F-statis- tics (FDC, FCT, and the FDT) for 16 different chromosomal rearrangements across all samples studied. Some of the FcT values were negative because some of the FDC values were larger than FDT. This means that chromosomal variation within demes was greater than between-cytotype vari- ation for some rearrangements, but these negative values can probably be consid- ered as zero in all cases. Most of these are rearrangements (Table 3: 4C, 5C, 5E, 5G, 6G, 6H) that occurred at low frequency and were either unique to single popula- tions or were scored from at most two or three localities and did not contribute to between-cytotype levels of divergence. Several rearrangements were more wide- 94 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="17">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 95 a A V \ __ _ _ _ A XA A 5 6 m 4 m m-5 5-6 6 6 b AAb~~~ b~~~AA-AAX X V a a b b b b a a b b b b a 5 ' 6 6-5 5-6 6 6 5 5-6 6-5 5 a or a a or b b b b b b b b a a a FIG. 8.-Diagrammatic representation of some possible mitotic and meiotic configurations for complex rearrangements observed in Fig. 7. A. Monobrachial fusion heterozygosity involving two homologous acro- centric elements of pair 5, and both a single acrocentric pair 6 element and a single microchromosome fused independently to each of the pair 5 elements. Such an interpretation would leave a single microchromosome, two homologous acrocentrics of pair 5, and two pair 6 elements (in this case in the form of a metacentric) unpaired in the mitotic karyotype (see Fig. 7A). One possible meiotic consequence of this structural hetero- zygosity would be the formation of a large multivalent with five chromosomes paired end-to-end in the order micro/micro + 5/5+6/6(metacentric)/6(acrocentric). This fusion would leave the remaining pair 5 acrocentric homologs free to pair as a separate bivalent. B. Fusion heterozygosity involving two pair 5 acrocentric homologues that fuse to two pair 6 acrocentric homologues. Meiotic consequences could include either the formation of an end-to-end paired quadrivalent plus a single bivalent, in either of two combinations, the formation of an end-to-end paired bivalent with two laterally-paired bivalents, again in either of two combinations, or the formation of three bivalents. spread and/or occurred at higher fre- quencies; 5D was variable among demes within cytotypes (FDC = 0.207) but showed little differentiation between cytotypes (FCT = -0.023). In contrast, 5B and 6B were both appreciably polymorphic across demes within cytotypes and also strongly differentiated among cytotypes (FDc = 0.100 and 0.172; FcT = 0.849 and 0.816, respectively). Four rearrangements (Table 3: 1B, 2B, 3B, 7B) displayed extremely low within-cytotype but very high between- cytotype divergence, whereas rearrange- ment 4B was geographically widespread across several different cytotypes and con- sequently was differentiated at only mod- est levels of between-cytotype divergence (FCT = 0.140). Averaging all rearrange- ments, the greatest differentiation is among demes (FDT = 0.430), but most of this is due to the pronounced between-cytotype divergence (FCT = 0.401). The FCT values also show that on average, 60% of the chro- mosomal variation across the entire sample area is due to variation within cytotypes. Similarly, within any given cytotype, an average of about 95% of all variation may be contained within demes (FDC = 0.053).

Chi-square tests show that pair 1 displays a significant excess of fission het- erozygotes in cytotypes F5, FM3 (at P &lt; 0.05 in both), and FM2 (P &lt; 0.01), and pair 4 shows a highly significant excess of fission heterozygotes in cytotypes F5+6 and FM2 (P &lt; 0.001 in both). The only other chromosomal marker showing sig- nificant deviation from random-mating genotypic ratios (FID = 0) is pair 3 in the FM3 cytotype, but the highly significant heterozygote deficiency is due to the pres- ence of a single fission homozygote (BB) at a single locality (no. 60, Appendix: Table A) within this race. None of the other markers deviate significantly from ran- dom mating expectations. Table 5 summarizes two different esti- mates of population subdivision for the chromosomal markers described above, within the same five cytotypes. Both mac- rochromosome pairs show significant be- tween-deme fission frequency heteroge- neity in the F5 cytotype, in both FST estimators. Pair 4 also shows pronounced fission frequency heterogeneity in F5+6 and FM2, in the Wright estimator (nega- tive FST values are undefined for the other). The same marker does not show strong substructuring within the FM3 race and is only marginally (P &lt; 0.05) significantly substructured within FM1. Pair 1 shows some degree of substructuring in all three FM cytotypes, and pairs 5 and 6 show mar- ginal subdivision within FM3 (P &lt; 0.05) and major heterogeneity within FM2 (P &lt; 0.001). Within some cytotypes, notably FM3 and FM2, there is a striking differ- ence between the FsT estimators with re- spect to their overall performance. The Weir-Cockerham estimators frequently gave negative (= undefined) values, whereas FsT(W) values were always positive. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are given in the Discussion. The significant x2 values for many chro- mosome markers suggest that, within a given cytotype, structuring may be pro- nounced enough for populations in close geographic proximity to be effectively in- dependent. Figure 10 presents the spatial correlograms for all five variable cyto- types, and even though some are repre- sented by very few localities, the overall picture presented is one of different pop- ulation structures among different cyto- types. For example, the F5 cytotype (Fig. 10A) showed statistically significant neg- ative correlation (between genetic and geographic distance) among smaller dis- tance classes, no significant correlation at intermediate distances, and then again some significant negative correlations at the largest distance classes.

DISCUSSION Geographical Relationships of Cytotypes The addition of over 50 new localities in this study to those described in Porter and Sites (1986) confirm and extend their findings in several ways. The basic pattern of geographical distribution for the cyto- types is very similar to the one described by Porter and Sites (1986:fig. 9). However, we have more than doubled the data base in terms of both number of animals and number of localities sampled, and now have much better defined distributions of most of the races in central Mexico. For ex- ample, the FM2 race was previously known from a small region in southern Hidalgo and northern Mexico. The overall size of the range of FM2 has been expanded only slightly, but our collecting efforts have es- tablished that it is surrounded by four oth- er cytotypes, which appear to mark its TABLE 4.-Fixation indices (F,I, equivalent to F,, of Wright, 1965, 1978) and x2 test (Waples, 1987) for deviation from random-mating proportions, for most of the samples within each of the five highly variable cytotypes of S. grammicus.

The surrounding of this race by presumably more ancestral cytotypes may be relevant to reconstructing the evolution of the com- plex, because some models of chromosom- al speciation predict that the distribution of the most derived race will be internal to all others (Hall, 1973, 1983; White, 1978a,b; and see below). The distribution of the presumed an- cestral cytotypes, Low- and High-S, has not changed with the increaseAin localities sampled; these populations have the most southern distribution of all the cytotypes. The exceptions are found in and near the city of Pachuca, Hidalgo. Sites et al. (1988) and Porter and Sites (1986) postulated that the Low-S population in Pachuca may rep- resent the result of human transport. This population (Fig. 1, no. 27) is genetically very similar to three other Low-S popu- lations collected in or near Mexico City (Sites et al., 1988), but is allozymically less variable.

How- ever, the High-S population from the El Chico area just northwest of Pachuca (Fig. 1, no. 28) appears to be isolated in a small patch of fir forest on the highest ridges. The elevation does not surpass 3000 m, but the habitat at El Chico is similar in struc- ture to that occupied by High-S popula- tions on the higher peaks surrounding the Valley of Mexico. The El Chico population could therefore represent a peripheral iso- late that attained its present distribution during more mesic Pleistocene periods when this forest type was presumably more widely distributed. Since there are clear differences between Low- and High-S at both protein (Sites et al., 1988) and DNA (Sites and Davis, 1989) markers, this hy- pothesis can be readily tested at the mo- lecular level. If we accept either the central Mexico High- or Low-S cytotype as ancestral, as suggested by chromosomal (Hall, 1973, 1980) and preliminary molecular (mtDNA and rDNA; Sites and Davis, 1989) studies, it is clear that the origin of the derived cytotypes was from a south-to-north di- rection (Fig. 5). The geographic relation- ships of these cytotypes is in general ac- cordance with a stasipatric model of speciation, as the more ancestral cytotypes surround the most recently derived forms. However, some of the other predictions and corollaries of the stasipatric hypothesis have not been verified in the S. grammicus complex. The most important of these is the assumption of strong underdominance for single chromosomal heterozygotes, yet S. grammicus consistently shows low levels of meiotic malassortment, at least in males heterozygous for one or two fission rear- rangements (Porter and Sites, 1985, 1987). These findings, coupled with high fre- quencies of within-sample polymorphisms and conformance to Hardy-Weinberg ra- tios for rearrangements presumed to be underdominant (this study), also suggest that at least some classes of chromosomal 98 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="21">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 99 B 40- .30- .20- .30- .10- .20- 0.0- - .10- -.10- 0.0 - -20- -10 -30- -:20 -.40- -30 -.50- -40 - I, ' , , ' I 10 20 30 40 0 o 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 FIG. 10.-Spatial correlograms of chromosomal rearrangement frequencies for five different cytotypes; ordinates show observed values of Moran's I coefficient, abscissas show distance classes in km, and open circles indicate statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05).

Sites and Moritz (1987) pointed out that the use of geographic distribution patterns alone to infer mechanisms of speciation among chromosomally differentiated taxa was inadequate because several different classes of speciation models overlapped in biogeographic predictions. For example, the original "stasipatric" and "chain pro- cess" models of White (1968, 1978b, re- spectively), and Hall's "cascade" model (1983) all predict that derived taxa would be geographically internal to the ancestral populations. These three models also as- sume strong underdominance for chro- mosomal heterozygotes and require a "Wrightian" population structure (re- HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 99 1991] r-</page><page sequence="22">100 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 TABLE 6.-Matrix of the combinations of S. grammicus cytotypes known or strongly suspected to hybridize on the basis of allozyme (A), chromosome (C), mtDNA (M) or rDNA (R) markers.

Other models, such as King's (1981) "primary chromosomal allopatry" hypothesis, predict that different cyto- types will be geographically arrayed in a linear sequence reflecting their phyloge- netic order of derivation. Though poten- tially useful, any such linear pattern could be subsequently obscured or obliterated on a topographically diverse landscape that has been subject to post-divergent climatic fluctuations, as is almost certainly the case for S. grammicus on the Mexican Plateau and adjacent mountain ranges. We do not wish to imply that the distributional data are unimportant, but stress that they are of limited use in the absence of indepen- dent data sets defining the genetic bound- aries of the S. grammicus cytotypes, a well corroborated phylogenetic hypothesis of all cytotypes in the sampling region, and cytogenetic studies of hybrid populations to determine if meiotic behavior in hybrid or backcross heterozygotes differs from that characteristic of within-cytotype non-hy- brid heterozygotes. S. grammicus Hybrid Zones Seven different contact zones are now known for the S. grammicus complex in central Mexico on the basis of chromosom- al markers, and additional populations are suspect (see below). Table 6 summarizes all known or likely pairs of contacts in S. grammicus and the marker(s) used to de- fine each zone. We know little about the dynamics of these contacts, although mul- tidisciplinary studies are ongoing. Of the zones summarized in Table 8, C, D, and E in Fig. 5 were originally described by Hall (1973, 1980) and Hall and Selander (1973), and most of the others were located by the intensive sampling efforts in the 1985 and 1986 collecting seasons. Almost half of these zones involve con- tacts between the most derived cytotype (FM2) with different combinations of more ancestral forms (B = FM2 x F5, C and G = FM2 x Low-S surrounding it). Two highly variable samples, 69 and 93 grouped consistently with or near the FM1 cytotype in the UPGMA clustering algorithm (Fig. 4), but their geographic locations at or near the edges of the FM2 range suggests that both could represent additional hybrid populations. We did not perform linear transect sampling needed to establish clin- al shifts of genetic markers in either case, but the chromosomal structure of each population (see below) is consistent with their probable hybrid zone status inferred from geography. Two other suspect populations, 56 and 57, also deserve brief comment. Sample 56 was consistently grouped well within the F5+6 cytotype on the basis of UPGMA clustering of all distance matrices (Fig. 4). Geographically, however, it sits at a "junc- 100 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="23">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 101 tion" between F5 and FM3, and possibly FM2 (Fig. 5). The genotypic composition of this sample reveals 7 of 19 individu- als with a conventional F5+6 karyotype, in which chromosome pairs 1-4 are fixed metacentric (AA), and pairs 5 and 6 are fixed acrocentric (BB). Since the FM3 race differs from F5 in being fixed for fissions at pairs 2 and 6 at both of these markers, F1 hybrids or backcross individuals be- tween the two should show fission hetero- zygosity at one or both pairs. Three indi- viduals were heterozygous for pair 2 fissions, but none of these individuals dis- played pair 6 fission heterozygosity. Other individuals show fission heterozygosity at pairs 1 and 4, either separately or in com- bination, and in one case pair 1 fission ho- mozygosity (Table A), but none of the an- imals were variable at pair 6. However, chromosome pairs 1 and 4 in FM2 are fixed (or nearly so) for fissions, whereas both F5 and FM3 retain the metacentric condition. Hence, heterozygosity at these markers in locality 56 could reflect asymmetric in- trogression of FM3 or FM2 (or both) mark- ers into F5. Alternative interpretations in- clude: 1) two-way hybridization (either F5 x FM3, FM3 x FM2, or F5 x FM2) cou- pled with increased chromosomal muta- tion rates (Shaw et al., 1983) to explain additional polymorphisms; or 2) sample 56 representing a peripherally isolated yet highly polymorphic F5+6 population. The sample from Vizarron, Queretaro (57 in Fig. 5), also consistently grouped within the F5+6 cytotype on the basis of its overall degree of chromosomal diver- gence (Fig. 4). Porter and Sites (1985) con- sidered the possibility of F5+6 x FM1 hybridization at this locality, but inter- preted this sample as a single highly poly- morphic population of the F5+6 cytotype, but Sites and Davis (1989) showed that it contained rDNA restriction sites represen- tative of both F5+6 and FM1 races. These two are not known to hybridize at present, and the 30 km hiatus between the north- ernmost FM1 locality and Vizarron seems to be real (see Fig. 5). However, the macro- chromosome pairs, for which this popu- lation displays extensive fission poly- morphism, 1, 2, and 4, are exactly those for which fixed or frequency fission dif- ferences characterize F5+6 and FM1. We therefore conclude that the Vizarron lo- cality represents a point of historically re- cent F5+6 x FM1 hybridization, and that the chromosomal rearrangements current- ly segregating in this population are selec- tively neutral in their meiotic effects (Por- ter and Sites, 1985). Despite the number of known or sus- pected hybrid zones in S. grammicus and the concomitant potential for chromosome "flow" across boundaries, most popula- tions maintain their identities. In those zones studied in some detail, both allozyme and chromosome markers shift from one race to another over short geographic dis- tances (about 1 km), and these shifts are usually concordant (Hall and Selander, 1973; Arevalo, 1988). Studies of DNA markers (Sites and Davis, 1989) show, however, that there is introgrqssion be- tween some of the cytotypes and that it is sometimes asymmetrical. For example, in the mountains surrounding the Valley of Mexico, some introgression of F6 mtDNA to the Low-S was evident and entirely uni- directional (Sites and Davis, 1989). Simi- larly, rDNA showed evidence of hybrid- ization of FM1 with both F5+6 and FM3, and FM3 with FM2. However, additional sampling is required to accurately esti- mate the pattern of molecular introgres- sion. Many studies of hybrid zones (reviewed by Barton and Hewitt, 1989; Hewitt, 1988, 1989) show that often the point of contact between the hybridizing populations is lo- cated in an ecotone or transition habitat. This is not the case for the majority of the S. grammicus zones, with the exception of the two contacts between a High-S and F6 populations (contacts D and F in Fig. 5). These two cytotypes are distributed along altitudinal gradients on mountains sur- rounding Mexico City (Arevalo, 1988; Hall, 1973). In both cases, F6 populations oc- cupy lower elevations (about 2400-3000 m) and inhabit fir or oak forests, whereas High-S are restricted to open pine or pine- fir forests above 3000 m. In both cases, hybrid/backcross individuals have been found in the ecotones between' the two forests, and the concordance of clinal change in marker loci occur there (Areva- 1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 101</page><page sequence="24">10 EPTOOIA MNGAHS[o lo, 1988; Hall and Selander, 1973) strongly implies that these are secondary contacts brought about by altitudinal shifts in veg- etation types associated with Pleistocene climatic changes. Evolutionary Implications of Additional Chromosome Variation in S. grammicus Recent studies of natural or experimen- tal hybrids have demonstrated elevated chromosomal mutation rates (Higele, 1984; Naveira and Fontdevila, 1985; Peters, 1982; Shaw et al., 1983) that are presumably pre- cipitated by the hybridization events. This may be occurring in S. grammicus, be- cause new classes of rearrangements were found at two localities where hybridization is suspected to occur. Specifically, both highly polymorphic localities (69 at Tepeji del Rio and 93 at Fray Francisco) show high frequencies (Tepeji = 0.17 and Fray Francisco = 0.59) of fusions between pairs 5 and 6, or in one case between 5 and a microchromosome (Fig. 7A). These rear- rangements are rare or absent elsewhere. Another possible example is in the Tulan- cingo area hybrid zone (arrow B in Fig. 5), where a pair 4 inversion was found at a frequency of 0.125, and two cases of triploidy also were scored (one example in Fig. 6F). The 5/6 fusion rearrangements also were found as within-sample poly- morphisms at three other localities, (Ca- pula [61], Apaxco [75] and S. L. Taxhimay [92]) at frequencies of 0.14, 0.33, and 0.17, respectively. These localities are not em- phasized in Fig. 5, but locations plotted in Fig. 1 show that they are located on the edges of cytotype ranges. Sample sizes are small, but the location of these populations also suggests that they could represent regions of parapatric hybridization. A test for linkage disequilibrium (Hill, 1974) was performed for samples 69 and 93, and showed that both localities were in strong disequilibrium (sample 69, D = 0.7511, P &lt; 0.0001; sample 93, D = 0.8893, P &lt; 0.001). Since mixing of different ge- netic entities can produce strong and per- sistent linkage disequilibrium if selection maintains steep gradients in allele fre- quencies (Barton and Hewitt, 1989), these tests corroborate our inferences based on distributions and both of these samples likely represent hybrid zone populations. The existence of the 5/6 fusions at these two localities may be very significant for the evolution of the complex. Several workers have previously hypothesized (Ba- ker and Bickham, 1986; Capana, 1982; Moritz, 1986) that monobrachial fusions may represent effective mechanisms for the isolation of chromosomal races upon secondary contact, whereas Robertsonian fusions or fissions would not necessarily disrupt gene flow. The influence of mono- brachial fusions on the speciation process occurs by disruption of chromosomal seg- regation of the chain multivalents, such as those observed in Fig. 7. We do not have any meiotic data on frequency of aneu- ploidy from any specimen with mono- brachial fusions, so we cannot evaluate the potential negative effect that formation of chain multivalents may have on the seg- regation process. However, if malsegre- gation is severe in these populations, the monobrachial heterozygotes could con- tribute significantly to post-mating isola- tion in these zones, regardless of their mode of origin. An alternative interpretation to hybrid- ization-induced spontaneous origin for the monobrachial rearrangements is that they represent simple F1 hybrid markers. How- ever, there is no evidence of a secondary contact between populations fixed for dif- ferent monobrachial fusions. The pre- sumed hybrid status of samples 69 and 93 involves combinations of cytotypes (FM1 x FM2 and FM3 x FM2, respectively) in which both pairs 5 and 6 are acrocentric; none of these cytotypes possesses metacen- tries in the right size classes to represent monobrachial fusions of different combi- nations of acrocentric elements. We there- fore conclude that these rearrangements had a mutational origin in the hybrid zones. The resolution of our standard karyo- types limits our ability to detect subtle re- arrangements, but the different meiotic pairing patterns suggest the presence of cryptic rearrangements, perhaps some translocations, over and above the mono- brachial fusions. An alternative is that the same basic spontaneous rearrangements are involved, but these have different meiotic HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 102</page><page sequence="25">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 103 consequences on different genetic back- grounds. These effects are well-docu- mented in mammals (de Boer, 1986; Searle, 1988) and might be expected in a zone of admixture containing Fl, F2 and different combinations of backcross individuals. Fu- ture studies of these two populatins would benefit from the application of approaches such as chromosomal banding techniques or synaptonemal complex analyses (Reed et al., 1990). Population Structure within Cytotypes We obtained estimates of chromosomal rearrangement frequencies over two or more years for the different localities (55, 57, 69, 77, 78, 85 and 89). As seen in Fig. 3, most of the different rearrangements were present through different years at any given locality, supporting earlier con- clusions (Porter and Sites, 1985, 1987) that there is no strong selection against any of these rearrangements (Nachman and My- ers, 1989). Almost all of the fission poly- morphisms plotted in Fig. 3 showed either frequency increases with time or no ap- preciable decreases. The single exception occurred in pair 4, at three localities (closed circles in Fig. 3E-G). The existence of sev- eral polymorphic pairs in samples 57 and 69 (Fig. 3B,E) is likely due to the hybrid condition of these two samples, as previ- ously discussed. Though 57 represents an apparent historical point of contact, the demonstration of ongoing hybridization at locality 69 would imply that chromosomal heterozygotes are not strongly selected against in a hybrid zone. Since this would contradict the requirements of almost all chromosomal speciation models (Sites and Moritz, 1987), it would repay further study. The calculations of hierarchical F sta- tistics, as expected, revealed much larger variances between cytotypes (FCT = 0.33) than within cytotypes (FDc = 0.045). How- ever, there is sufficient subdivision within cytotypes to permit maintenance of neu- tral chromosomal polymorphisms in het- erogenous frequencies (Table 5). It is commonly accepted that chromosomal re- arrangements have a unique origin (White, 1973; but see Shaw et al., 1983). If true for most rearrangements in S. grammicus, the present population structure would suggest that they have spread either through sampling error associated with oc- casional gene flow among semi-isolated groups, and/or cycles of extinction-recol- onization events. Although individual demes approximate random mating (Ta- ble 4), drift effects could be pronounced if the number of individuals founding new colonies is small, migration rates between demes are low (Wade and McCauley, 1988), and the chromosomal rearrange- ments are selectively neutral or nearly so. The latter requirement seems to be met for intrapopulation fission polymorphisms in S. grammicus (Porter and Sites, 1985, 1987). These influences are further en- hanced if founder individuals are all drawn from the same ancestral population (Slat- kin, 1977), and if rates of extinction are low, significant between-deme differenti- ation will result and leave little opportu- nity for gene flow (Maruyama and Kimura, 1980). Repeated extinction-colonization cycles, however, will promote the spread of chromosomal rearrangements, though the population parameters (rates of ex- tinction, colonization, migration, long-term effective population size, and number of founders) are different for strongly un- derdominant versus neutral rearrange- ments (Lande, 1979, 1985). These are eco- logical parameters and are unknown for S. grammicus, but it is clear that several possible interactions of the relevant factors would promote the establishment and spread of new chromosomal rearrange- ments, regardless of whether they had sin- gle or multiple origins, and simultaneously allow for substantial influence by drift (see reviews by Slatkin, 1987; Wade and McCauley, 1988). A consideration of the estimates of FST within cytotypes (Table 5), reveals be- tween-cytotype differences in the degree of population structure. For example, the FM3 and FM1 races show very little sub- structure, whereas populations of the F5, F5+6 and FM2 showed highly significant FST values for all polymorphic chromo- some pairs present. These findings suggest that these three cytotypes have more struc- tured populations than FM3 and FM1. Al- though precise relationships between F 1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 103</page><page sequence="26">104 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 statistics and spatial autocorrelation ap- proaches have not been established, sev- eral classes of population structures have been described in terms of their expected patterns of autocorrelation (Sokal and Wartenberg, 1981, 1983). The simulations of Sokal and Wartenberg (1983) showed a definite association between isolation-by- distance processes (Wright, 1943) and sta- tistically significant spatial autocorrela- tion. Three of the five cytotypes we studied by spatial autocorrelation showed some negative correlation between genetic and geographic distances (Fig. 10). Two of the correlograms (Fig. 10B,D; F5+6 and FM1 cytotypes, respectively) showed that this negative relationship was restricted to higher geographic distances and statisti- cally significant. The same general pattern was apparent in FM3 (Fig. 10C) but not significantly. The F5 cytotype (Fig. 10A) showed significant negative correlations at small and large distances but not in the intermediate range. The FM2 race showed nonsignificant correlation across all dis- tance classes (Fig. 10E). Different underlying processes may generate similar patterns (Sokal and War- tenberg, 1981), but the identification of consistent patterns at least narrows the range of interpretations. The correlograms of the F5+6, FM3, and FM1 cytotypes (Fig. 10B-D, respectively) show a clear "clinal" pattern, but since sample sizes for these three cytotypes were small, these must be interpreted with caution. Clinal patterns may result from either selection for characters tracking an environmental gradient, or isolation-by-distance reflect- ing a "diffusion" process of individuals neutral for the trait in question, and having limited dispersal ability relative to the ex- tent of the entire range. We favor the latter interpretation for the reasons previously given that suggest neutral, or nearly so, chromosomal markers. This "cline" type pattern is manifested in the three cyto- types from which populations were sam- pled from linear ranges. The F5+6 sam- ples extend in a southwest-northeast rectangular section of the study area, whereas FM3 and FM1 occupy almost strictly linear east-west and north-south ranges, respectively (Fig. 5). Of these three, the FM1 race has been the most thor- oughly sampled from its total range and is the least structured (Table 5). F5+6 in- habits extensive areas outside of the study area depicted in Fig. 5 (see Sites et al., 1987), and is strongly structured for the single chromosome marker sampled (Ta- ble 5), and FM3 represents an unknown. It does not display extremely pronounced structuring at most markers (Table 5), but our sampling efforts have not allowed us to document its total range. We tentatively conclude that FM1 appears to have an iso- lation-by-distance population structure (Wright, 1943) along a linear range and that the same structure is possible for both F5+6 and FM3, although the latter must remain a working hypothesis until further sampling is possible. The irregularities in the correlograms of all three of these cy- totypes suggest the possibility of apprecia- ble sampling error effects superimposed on the neutral diffusion process, especially for F5+6 (Fig. 10B). However, irregularities in the correlograms would be expected in a nonequilibrium situation, which could very likely apply to most central Mexico S. grammicus populations. This could be due not only to post-Pleistocene adjust- ments in population size and distribution but also to more recent anthropomorphic alterations in this part of Mexico by pre- Columbian civilizations. It may well re- quire more than a few thousand genera- tions to reach stable distribution for any polymorphic nuclear marker segregating in millions of animals spread across thousands of square kilometers. The F5 and FM2 correlograms (Fig. 10A,E, respectively) are based on larger sample sizes, so we can be more confident that the patterns obtained are more ac- curate estimators of underlying processes. Since both of these cytotypes show strong structuring at all chromosomal markers (Table 5), and their correlograms are plot- ted on similar geographic scales, the dis- cordant patterns likely reflect the overrid- ing influence of genetic drift on the frequencies of chromosomal polymor- phisms. Correlograms may be influenced by population size relative to sampling scale, migration patterns and rates from 104 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5</page><page sequence="27">1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 105 different source populations, and differ- ences in neighborhood size (Sokal and Wartenberg, 1981, 1983). F5 populations inhabit woodlands and edificarian habi- tats, and populations attain high densities in oak forests containing scattered hollow trees. The FM2 race also inhabits edifi- carian sites but is seldom found in wood- lands and prefers open areas such as Aga- ve, Opuntia, and Yucca communities. Both cytotypes vary in densities from place to place and therefore may differ in some or all of the above parameters, at least oc- casionally. We do not have the demo- graphic data necessary to address these possibilities, but we suggest that the pop- ulations are structured in such a manner that drift must be pronounced at times and gene flow or selection must also be ade- quate to maintain some polymorphisms throughout the ranges of these cytotypes. We wish to make a few comments about the performance of the FST estimators list- ed in Table 5. These coefficients either represent the original FST parameter of Wright (1951) or are derived from it but modified to correct for the effects of lim- ited sampling of populations and numbers of individuals. Weir and Cockerham (1984) simply relate their estimates to analysis of variance and stress the need for an FST estimator to accomodate the possibility of different sample sizes in terms of both numbers of individuals drawn from pop- ulations, and numbers of loci and alleles observed per sample. Since the Weir- Cockerham statistics are strictly estima- tors, they must have the property of con- verging to the true value from either direction (above or below). The existence of negative FST values for Weir and Cock- erham's estimators suggest that either the assumptions are at times no more valid than those of Wright (1951), that they were designed to obviate, or that the sampling correction factors frequently overcorrect more than necessary. Although negative FST values are undefined, most are close to zero (Table 5), so we can consider them as insignificant. There is controversy over the use of F statistics (Nei, 1986), which we cannot resolve here, but since the Wright estimate makes no corrections for sam- pling problems and because it is a variance estimator, it can never be negative. There- fore, the Wright parameters will consis- tently provide interpretable results, in the sense that values will always be positive. SUMMARY In many respects, the cytogenetic and population genetic studies carried out on the S. grammicus complex have highlight- ed more questions than answers. The dis- tributional and population data presented in this paper, however, at least identify some of the major questions that can now be addressed. Earlier conclusions on the neutrality of intrapopulational chromo- somal polymorphisms, in terms of their inconsequential meiotic effects in males, seem secure. The meiotic studies of Porter and Sites (1985, 1987) are supported by population cytogenetic studies (Porter and Sites, 1986; this paper) showing that these same rearrangements are often widely dis- tributed within some cytotypes, almost al- ways present in Hardy-Weinberg propor- tions within populations, and appear to be persistent through time. Collectively, these lines of evidence present a convincing case against strong underdominance for these rearrangements (see also Nachman and Myers, 1989). Still unanswered are major questions re- lating to the origin of chromosomal rear- rangements with the S. grammicus com- plex, their subsequent spread and fixation, and their fitness effects in hybrid zones. We also have yet to establish unequivo- cally the phylogenetic relationships of the chromosome races in central Mexico, al- though a preliminary study has revealed the potential utility of several classes of molecular markers (Sites and Davis, 1989). This will require more extensive sampling and possibly the use of additional molec- ular markers, but the formulation of a well corroborated phylogenetic hypothesis for S. grammicus will provide an important historical perspective on the direction and extent of chromosomal change, and the possibility of identifying hybrid zones of potential primary origin (i.e., those formed between sister races) versus those estab- lished via secondary contact. Many of these kinds of studies are now in progress both at the cytogenetic and molecular levels, 1991] HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS 105</page><page sequence="28">106 HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS [No. 5 and the S. grammicus complex should con- tinue to be a valuable research resource in evolutionary genetics. RESUMEN Los fenotipos cromosomicos de 786 la- gartijas del complejo Sceloporus gram- micus, colectadas en 55 localidades de la porcion central de Mexico fueron cuanti- ficados, llevando a un total de 1383 indi- viduos de 93 localidades. Los pares cro- mosomicos variables fueron codificados como genotipos mendelianos y analizados por varios algoritmos de agrupamiento y de genetica de poblaciones. Se utilizaron los dendrogramas del algoritmo UPGMA para agrupar a todas las muestras de acuer- do a distancias genicas o matrices de si- militud; consistentemente, se identificaron siete grupos discretos. Estos hallazgos con- firman y extienden los resultados de un estudio previo de citogenetica de pobla- ciones, el cual proporciono los datos ne- cesarios para completar los mapas de dis- tribucion de algunos citotipos. Los esfuerzos de colecta y mapeo a gran resolucion han revelado varias zonas adicionales de hi- bridizacion parapatrica entre diferentes citotipos, que llevan a siete el numero total de zonas de hibridacion identificadas por marcadores cromosomicos. Varias otras poblaciones son altamente polimorficas para los rearreglos cromosomicos y se en- cuentran en o cerca de las orillas de los limites de algunos citotipos en particular, lo cual sugiere que estos tambien pueden representar zonas de hibridacion adicio- nales. Aparentemente, estas poblaciones contienen tambien altas frecuencias de fu- siones, que son muy raras o se encuentran ausentes en otros, nosotros sugerimos que estas mutaciones pueden ser manifestacio- nes de efectos disgenesicos de la hibrida- cion. La estructura genetica de las poblacio- nes fue estimada para todos los citotipos con base en las distribuciones y frecuencias de los rearreglos cromosomicos. Un analisis jerarquico de estadisticos F mostro que la mayor parte de la variacion cromosomica total pudo ser repartida entre el compo- nente dentro de la poblacion (67%) en re- lacion con la de entre citotipos (33%). Los coeficientes de consanguinidad mostraron que para la mayoria de las muestras, no se desviaron significativamente de las pro- porciones en apareamientos al azar, y en pocos casos donde lo hubo, la direccion es siempre hacia el exceso de heterocigotos. Algunos de los citotipos mostraron signi- ficativa heterogeneidad entre muestras, en las frecuencias de los rearreglos cromoso- micos, y los analisis de autocorrelacion pro- dujeron correlogramas que sugieren una estructura de aislamiento por distancia, para algunos citotipos y un patron alea- torio en otros casos en donde la deriva ge- nica probablemente constituyo la fuerza primordial. Los patrones de variacion cro- mosomica y estructura poblacional infe- rida, se discuten con respecto a las impli- caciones para varias hipotesis de evolucion cromosomica y especiacion.
