<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XLVII APRIL 1952 NUMBER 2 THE 'STURM UND DRANG' MOVEMENT The term Sturm und Drang has less ambiguity than most categories of literary history; it raises few of the questions which are necessarily provoked by such terms as 'Baroque' or 'Romanticism'. It is applied to a group of writers who were allied in a very personal and real way, and whose cohesion scarcely needs proving. It is however advisable to define the composition of the group, since lack of precision in this respect has caused confusion in the interpretation of its work. It was publicly identified for the first time, I believe, by Wieland, who spoke disparagingly, in 1774, of the 'Hamann sect', including Herder, Goethe, and Lenz.1 Merck, Klinger, H. L. Wagner, and Maler Miiller may be added as personal associates and literary allies. Hamann was an older man who in many ways remained apart from the others and who is best considered as a precursor; Klopstock and Justus M6ser may be given a similar title. Leisewitz is usually accounted one of their number, but he did not know'the others, and touches the Sturm und Drang only in his one play, Julius von Tarent. There were a number of men who went along with them for a short time- Lavater, Jung-Stilling, F. L. Stolberg, Burger, F. H. Jacobi and Heinse in parti- cular-but careful study reveals important differences between their views and those of the Stiirmer unW Drdnger, even where they seem most akin. The movement might be said to start in 1770, when Herder and Goethe met; it remained a move- ment of young men, and in all the important members a marked change or develop- ment is to be observed by about 1777 or 1778. Herder and Goethe, the most profound and comprehensive of them, form the heart of the movement, though Lenz's contribution is by no means negligible. One of the most troublesome problems is the position of Schiller. Ten years younger than Goethe, he had no personal contact with any other Stiirmer und Drdnger, and began to write only after the others had emerged from their Sturm und Drang. In spite of an obvious resemblance with their views and outlook, one finds in fact many important points of difference, in his general temperamental make-up, his mode of life, and his literary style and themes. It is always necessary to bear these differences in mind, if the Sturm und Drang is to be accurately and fully understood. The importance of the Sturm und Drang as the first flowering of the greatest period of German literature cannot be contested. Yet there have been remarkably few comprehensive studies devoted to it, since the first beginnings by Erich Schmidt and Jakob Minor in the nineteenth century. With some justification, but much over-emphasis, it is usually treated as a stage in a development, but is then subsumed under some such heading as 'irrationalism', 'the German spirit', and is frequently treated as a mere preparation for German romanticism (e.g. by Kinder- mann, Benz and Ruprecht). It was a movement of young men; but, unjustly, juvenile rebelliousness has been taken to be a predominant characteristic. Specialized studies fail to relate its various aspects, so that both the range and the unity of its achievement are underestimated; in particular the new conception of poetry, and the new poetry itself, are often treated as something apart from the new interpretations of society, history, consciousness, and nature. There is a lack 1 Teutscher Merkur (1774), No. 8, 174-84.

The best and most comprehensive study is the first volume of Korff's Geist der Goethe-Zeit, though this work suffers from some of the failings mentioned above, and especially from Korff's abstract conception of his work as 'die Geschichte des ideellen Wachstums einer fiber die Individuen und individuellen Leistungen hin verteilten Idee'. One still returns with profit to the great biographies like Haym's Herder (1880-5) and Unger's Hamann und die Aufkldrung (1911) where the richness of the principal figure, at least, is expounded in its fullness.1 We know enough of great poetic achievement to recognize that it is not the outcome solely of a felicitous gift, and that the gift of poetic utterance is not some- thing apart from life, thought and feeling. The poet is the whole man, and issues out of innumerable factors that his times present to him: thus history is a necessary pre-condition to literary criticism in the fullest sense. While doing justice to individual character and variation, an adequate study of the Sturm und Drang must start from that common stock of experience, practical and spiritual, out of which its unity of response grew-and indeed we have a model in the two great autobiographical statements of the group, Goethe's Dichtung und Wahrheit and Herder's Journal meiner Reise. It was of course a sharply discriminating response and in view of the pugnacity of the movement's expressions one hardly runs the danger of breaking up the uniqueness and unity of their achievement into a number of 'influences'. Here there is no space to discuss the Stiirmer und Drdnger in all their variety,2 but it is necessary to reach some guiding principle which will account, in the fullest possible sense, for their indebtedness and their hostility to predecessors and contemporaries, for what links them to the past and what constitutes their specific achievement. All definitions which are couched in purely ideal terms, especially those which would claim a clear repudiation of humanism or rationalism, break down on closer examination-'subjectivism', 'irrationalism', 'a new religion', 'Germanism , 'individualism, 'freedom' are either false or only partially true; or like 'humanism' are not sufficiently precise. We find an immense debt to British and French humanists, rationalists, and empiricists, as well as conflict with them. If the German Aufkldrung, so feeble a reflexion of European humanism, provoked their contemptuous hostility, we must remember what they owed to Lessing- when he died Herder wrote: 'Ich kann nicht sagen, wie mich sein Tod verodet hat: es ist, als ob dem Wanderer alle Sterne untergehen, und der dunkele wolkigte Himmel bliebe.'3 Herder wrote this in full consciousness of his differences with 1 Among recent studies which at least touch on Jahrhunderts (Stuttgart, 1949); J.

The relationship of the Sturm und Drang to the 'eighteenth century' can perhaps most conveniently be summed up in terms of their relationship with Lessing. He, in close sympathy with writers like Richardson and Diderot, sought to break through dogmas of every sort and to reshape thought and art on the basis of experience and reason. Neither of these two terms interprets an absolute; they mean the experience and reason or knowledge available, and they define essentially the experience of the contemporary middle class, often in polemical distinction from that of other classes, particularly of courts and nobility. In this respect the Stiirmer und Dringer continue their work. But they take it much further, for they delve much deeper into the inner life of the burgher world and assert its values with a far greater confidence and passion, even recklessness. They overthrow the 'reasonable' com- promises, the caution of the realists, and the half-heartedness of the 'pre-romantics', among their European contemporaries. True to their experience as Germans, their work has not the practical, political or economic range of the British and French; but, less restrained by social responsibilities in a country without public life or a cultural centre, they undermine more radically than any contemporaries (more even than Rousseau) the rule of 'polite society' in the sphere of culture.1 Thus we may see the Sturm und Drang as a stage in a most significant and vast development -not in a purely ideological movement or towards a limited 'objective' such as Romanticism or Idealism, but a stage in a whole complex of human relationships, principles, and problems, that become characteristic of the nineteenth century and still have significance to-day. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ATTITUDE In the sphere of social and political thought the Stiirmer und Drdinger were more successful in grasping problems than asserting principles. They were all of burgher families, and academically educated; the Germany in which they grew up was split into innumerable principalities and free towns all governed by absolute rulers or hereditary patriciates. In revolt against the narrowness of public office and of normal burgher occupations, they failed to discover any political or social movement to which they could give their allegiance. Resolutely bourgeois in outlook, there is no lack of criticism of despotism and courtiers in their works, and equally of the spirit of subservience in the middle class. Criticism of courts is, indeed, as a rule excessive and frequently betrays a juvenile ignorance of court circles; but Merck knew what he was talking about when he warned Lenz against court-life in which 'alle Eigenthiimlichkeit des Menschen verloren geht .2 Goethe writes from Weimar of 'das durchaus ScheiBige dieser zeitlichen Herrlichkeit';3 though we can see the beneficial influence of experience when we compare the court in Egmont with that in Gotz. One must note that Schiller's criticism of social oppression and of a corrupt court in Die Rduber and Kabale und Liebe is far more precise, and more to the point, than that in other Sturm und Drang works; while at the same time he subscribes in 1 See for the idea of 'polite society' B.

But the characteristic Sturm und Drang situation is the abrupt repudiation of the political world, devoid of value, in favour of the private life where the individual can live according to his own feelings. This is the first wish of Karl Moor, and the limit of Ferdinand von Walter's personal ambition. Klinger finds this solution in Das leidende Weib and Sturm und Drang. In Julius von Tarent Leisewitz more challengingly opposes the idea of private domestic bliss to government, even when the ruler is a model. Werther also seeks a refuge in simple circumstances, though Goethe's deeper insight shows the insecurity of the ideal itself. In Gotz Goethe finds the most firmly established form in which this ideal may be realized, a historic mode of life sustained by warm personal relations and practical activity. In all cases, however, the worthy life appears as something insecure or unattainable, and the struggle for it is tragic, either through the might of political power or (and in addition) through the tragic conflict within the hero's own self. It is noteworthy that, much as the Stiirmer und Drdnger owed to Rousseau, they do not follow him in his attempts, in La nouvelle Heloise, Emile, and Du contrat social, to find some way of reconciling inner values with outer social obligations; more drastically than he, they assert the conflict as an insoluble one. Together with many outbursts against despotic rule and against the pettiness of public life, there is a remarkable lack of direct political interest in the Sturm und Drang. Herder could ascribe the decline of culture to the lack of a homogeneous public, to the lack of 'Freyheit und Menschengefiihl', but such terms are not linked with their meaning in the modern political sense.1 Occasionally he utters an out- burst against Charlemagne for having enslaved the Germans. But their concern with the nation arises almost entirely from their concern with culture and their desire for a poetry which will truly interpret German life. They were as obdurate to Klopstock's idealization of freedom as they were to his nationalism; both ideals they felt to be 'phantoms', meaningless, mere tirades; and in retrospect both Goethe and Herder condemned such excesses as the product of a time in which there was no great cause to enlist energies.2 Their distrust of this high-sounding vehemence was reasonable and shrewd, for in practice Klopstock, like the capable and free-speaking administrator C. F. von Moser (for whom the Stiirmer und Drdnger had a healthy respect), admired the enlightened despot and hankered after a restoration of the medieval empire under the Habsburgs. The American War of Independence broke out at the height of the Sturm und Drang, and their response to it shows how little they understood or sympathized with the political idea of independence. Klopstock supported the insurgents, as did Stolberg and Schubart; Schiller sympathized with their aims. But Lenz (the great politician !) called the colonists idiots. He and Klinger were ready to enlist on the English side, like Werther and many other characters of Sturm und Drang works. Indifferent to the issue of freedom, they sought in this war, in war in general, 1 See, for example, Herder's Haben wir noch Herder, Humanitdtsbriefe, No. 11.

'Where war is, there am I.'1 Their attitude to the American War throws considerable light on the ambiguity of their use of the word 'freedom', yet it is usual to consider them champions of political freedom.2 They might have a bad conscience about it, like Goethe's Fernando (in Stella), who escapes the turmoil of his emotions by taking part in the suppression of the rising of the 'noble' Corsicans. Bodmer, the good republican, was astonished at Goethe's admiration for the tyrant Caesar.3 Political power and aggrandisement were devoid of all meaning in their view. Here again they must be distinguished from men like Heinse or Schubart, who, for all their worship of 'freedom', were fascinated by the success of Frederick the Great. The two Prussians among them, Hamann and Herder, had nothing but loathing for Prussia, for its despotism and its ruthless efficiency-like Winckelmann and Lessing before them. They might feel sympathy, with Goethe, for Frederick's personal heroism, but not for his system, nor for the extension of Prussian power, which in Herder's view was the negation of all true social and personal welfare. In Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte Herder delivers a broadside on all power- politics, all imperialism, whether political or economic, including with Prussian expansionism that of England and France. Their main attack was, however, delivered at the German system, at the bureaucratic despotisms characteristic of the German states; even if these were efficient, in their view they brought a fatal impoverish- ment of personal life and initiative. With an eye to Prussia Merck wrote that departments of state are now organized like army battalions: Der tabellarische Geist hat den individuellen verdrangt. Und da es jeder gleich gut machen soll, so macht es nicht leicht einer besser als der andere. Jedes Mannes Gewalt und Redlichkeit ist so enge controlliert, und jeder so subaltern von dem andern, daB es kaum der Miihe lohnt, das Zutrauen zu verdienen, das man ihm zum voraus versagt hat.4 In such a situation, the temptation to repudiate all social obligation, as do so many figures in their works, was strong; Hamann in fact gave them a lead in this direction, in his actual life and his writings. But the Stiirmer und Drdnger were haunted by the idea of worthy practical activity-we see this in Herder's Journal or his letters to Caroline Flachsland, his welcome to the calls to Biickeburg and Weimar; in Lenz's 'Handeln sey die Seele der Welt'; 5 in poetic symbols like Gotz or Prometheus. And in what framework could they find activity? All the political theorists of their time were at one in recommending enlightened (benevolent) despotism as the best framework for social advance, however differently A. L. von Schlozer, C. F. von Moser, Klopstock, Kant, or Justus Moser himself, might interpret the term 'advance'. It is therefore not surprising that the Stiirmer und Drdnger themselves thought and worked within the assumptions of enlightened despotism. Weimar was not an accident, but a principle. Goethe tells us that, on his first meeting with Karl August, they discussed Moser's writings; M6ser is nearer to the Stiirmer und Drdnger than any other 1 Klinger to Kayser, 23 April 1779. M.

He wrote from the experience of an absolutism, but in a very small state without a hereditary ruler, where the administrators could be in close contact with all social strata and could interest themselves in all aspects of life. He was a consistent opponent of the large state and the bureaucratic apparatus necessary in a large autocracy. While he was deeply concerned for welfare and efficiency, he was equally anxious to strengthen the social ties which promote the cohesion of social groups, and link them to the whole society. He valued all those traditions and customs which weld the individual to the group, and thought of the individual not as a 'subject' but as a participant in a community. The state itself was for him not a power-unit, but a historical entity made up of most diversified groups, whose purpose was realized only if it strengthened the vigour of these groups. Thus he defended traditional corporations and sought to maintain privileges and rights which ensured corporate existence. He pointed out that the abolition of serfdom was no unmixed blessing. In strong contrast to the general trend of Aufkldrung thought he sought to strengthen the separate identity of the social estates, seeing in them a means to check the power of the ruler. Goethe says in Book 15 of Dichtung und Wahrheit that Moser's standpoint gave meaning to the anarchy of Germany, since he showed how the mass of small states gave the opportunity to tend the peculiar culture of each district. Through him the Stiirmer und Drdnger were fortified in their interest for the local, provincial, con- crete forms of life. Loathing despotism and the impersonality of the bureaucratic state, they saw the traditional estates as a defence of 'freedom '-we find Herder, in Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte, condemning the 'mixing of social estates and putting in a word for feudalism and serfdom. But this backward-looking ideal involved them in characteristic and almost unavoidable contradictions. They learnt from Moser that the nobility was a defence against despotism. Even the boldest German spirits echoed this theme, C. F. von Moser and Schubart among them. In Sturm und Drang works one often meets with the honest nobleman, the country squire, who seeks to improve conditions or to check corruption. Most of their heroes are noblemen, and it might well be thought that in their view only noblemen, like G6tz, Julius von Tarent, Karl Moor or Ferdinand von Walter, had the spirit to assert themselves against the earthly powers. At the same time there is the sharpest criticism of noblemen, of their arrogance and class-conceit-see Der Hofmeister, Werther, and their private correspondence (Brander's remark in Urfaust is not untypical: 'Das ist was vornehmes inkognito, sie haben so was unzufriednes b6ses im Gesicht'). This contradiction runs through all Goethe's and Herder's work, till their death; and there is a personal note in Herder's remark about Swift: 'Was den Dechant am meisten niederdriickte, waren die obern Stande. Sie hielt er fur unverbesserlich; und an sie hatte er sich so sehr gehangen, und sie so sehr getrauet'1 (in his Sturm und Drang days, Herder liked to call himself 'der Dechant', after Swift). There is a similar contradiction, or ambiguity, in the attitude of the Sturm und Drang to marriage between burgher and noble. Misalliance is the theme of many of their works, and there is no mistaking the sympathy with which they treat two lovers separated by class. But even Schiller conceives such an alliance as possible only outside society. Indeed, they criticize the sentimental novel because it untruthfully shows that love may conquer social prejudice (e.g. in Lenz's Soldaten or Klinger's Das leidende Weib), and in Die 1 Herder, Adrastea, No. 19.</page><page sequence="7">Soldaten Lenz roundly asserts that a young burgher girl must not raise her eyes to the nobility. Their attitude to the feudal constitution is equally contradictory. In Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte Herder writes contemptuously of the 'freedom' which has shackled the lawless barons, dissolved the guilds, and emancipated the serfs-as one reads one thinks of G3tz.1 But in Riga he had commended a nobleman who had emancipated his serfs, and he welcomed the breaking of feudal privilege in France at the time of the Revolution. Merck on a visit to Russia recommended the emanci- pation of the serfs. It is a significant comment on the German situation that Herder, Merck, and Lenz, when they were associated with Russian affairs, keenly participated in the schemes of enlightened reform that were circulating at that time in Catharine's court; in Germany they were bitterly frustrated and uncertain of themselves. The attitude of the Stiirmer und Drdnger to the common people was less ambiguous, though very complex. It was determined by cultural considerations-at no time do they envisage the bourgeoisie or the Volk as a political force. In the common people they found the real substance of the nation. In his review of an English book which summed up the characteristics of Germany in terms of 'polite society', Goethe exploded against the whole notion of 'good society', 'polite nations'; the German character is to be found, he wrote, in the domestic family, the farm, the workshop, the inn and coffee-house.2 Their works show how they claimed cultural intercourse between burgher and noble. But there is no admiration for merchants and bankers in their writings; the noble merchant of the English and French tradition is absent, and on the contrary there is much vexation expressed with the dull routine of bourgeois employment. The dissatisfaction of a Werther or a Wilhelm Meister turns into sharp criticism when the professional classes come on the scene, and all through the Sturm und Drang we find vehement and contemptuous attacks on 'Stubengelehrten' as men who neglect living for the sake of ideas or learning. Most drastically in the Ossian essay Herder opposed to the learned 'pedants' of his time the untutored, 'natural' classes-' unverdorbne Kinder, Frauenzimmer, Leute von gutem Naturverstande, mehr durch Thatigkeit, als Spekulation gebildet '.3 It is one of the great achievements of Sturm und Drang writing to have captured the reality and charm of these practical social groups, young women in the home, children, tradesmen, peasants. But again, they do not make them an ideal, or attribute to them more than the virtues of their limited sphere, as the Romantics were to do; or, if they tended to do so, they checked themselves. Herder and Burger, in the first flush of their enthusiasm for folksong, thought they found in artisans and peasants the true bearers of poetic culture. But they were too faithful to their intellectual heritage (and too intimidated by hostile critics) to maintain this standpoint, and they hastily assured everyone that by Volk they did not mean the Pobel. With fine tact Goethe makes Faust say, of Gretchen's room: In dieser Armuth welche Fiille ! In diesem Kercker welche Seeligkeit! The Stiirmer und Dringer appreciated the richness and 'warmth' of burgher existence and grasped the critical points at which burgher values were threatened, 1 Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte.

But in their very contradictions they were most true to the life around them. Not only are their imaginative works full of vivid realistic observation, but their social and political ideas are distinguished too by a greater concreteness than those of Nicolai, Schlozer, or even Kant, and truth- fully reflect a stagnant, bewildering social reality. One may suggest that it was this obduracy of the political and social structure of Germany that made, not Herder's political ideas, but his theory of history, the finest flower of their social thought. It was his repudiation of the bureaucratic state, of unhampered absolu- tism, or power-politics and expansionism, his longing for a social community where thought and practical life were in harmony, that led him to understand the cultural qualities of early society and of the Biblical patriarchate, that gave him insight into the dependence of governmental forms on the mode of life of a people, that enabled him to appreciate how complex is the law of social development. There are many palpable faults in his theory of history, in its early and late form; 1 but the value of his insight cannot be contested, and, in its strength and weakness, it is an integral part of the Sturm und Drang. MAN AND NATURE The Sturm und Drang conflict with Aufkldrung philosophy springs from the same root as their political thought. It is essentially a conflict about the powers of man. The Stiirmer und Drdnger refused to accept the cramping interpretation of man as an etiolated intelligence; they were savagely contemptuous of men who turned the universe into a web of ideas, and who defined man and his destiny in terms of abstractions. 'Metaphysics', 'speculation', 'abstractions' are always terms of vituperation with the Stiirmer und Drdnger, directed against the pedestrian arro- gance of Nicolai, the idealistic constructions of Mendelssohn, and the speculative theology of the time. For the Berlin rationalists, the toleration to speculation allowed by Frederick the Great was a great stride towards 'perfection'. Lessing had already bitterly contrasted this 'freedom to utter follies' with the actual slavishness of life in Berlin. Herder was more extreme in his fury: 'Das liebe, matte, argerliche, unniitze Freidenken, Ersatz fur alles, was sie [die Menschen] vielleicht mehr brauchten-Herz! Warme! Blut! Menschheit! Leben!'2 In Dichtung und Wahrheit Goethe put this principle positively in his (rather over-generous) summing-up of Hamann's thought: 'Alles was der Mensch zu leisten unternimmt, es werde nun durch That oder Wort oder sonst hervorgebracht, muB aus sammtlichen vereinigten Kraften entspringen; alles Vereinzelte ist verwerflich.'3 Herder's philosophical works, on language, knowledge, and poetry, are part of a consistent effort to work out the fundamental principles of this revolt against the degradation of human capacities, to justify on the broadest basis this desire for the full employment of all human faculties. It brought him into conflict not only with minor figures, but also with Kant, and his criticism of Kant, over the theory of history, epistemology, and aesthetics, has not received the attention which is its due. Too often his philosophy is summed up as 'irrationalism', and we shall see how 1 See, for instance, R. Stadelmann, Der 2 Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte. Werke. historische Sinn bei Herder (Halle, 1928); and v, 538. my 'Herder and the Scottish Historical School' 3 Dichtung und Wahrheit, Book 12. (English Goethe Society Publications, xIv, 1939). 136</page><page sequence="9">misleading this definition is. Like Hamann he owed an immense debt to English empiricists like Bacon and Locke, French sensualists like Diderot and Condillac, and to Hume's scepticism.1 But while Hamann utilized the arguments of em- piricists and sceptics to justify his 'Kohlerglauben', Herder built out of them a philosophy which is essentially humane and secular. This philosophy asserts the primacy of being over thinking. In contrast to the Cartesian idealists of his time, he insists that sense and activity are as fundamental to man as thought. The theme of his Vom Erkennen und Empfinden der mensch- lichen Seele, at which he was writing between 1774 and 1778, is that there is no knowing without feeling, and neither without will and activity. Philosophy must be, in his view, an induction from experience-metaphysics should be, he writes, an 'after-physics'; and his own experience taught him that thoughts and feelings impregnate one another, and both are shaped by particular and local situations (it was this interwovenness that he so admired in Shakespeare). He eagerly embraced Leibniz's dynamic conception of matter, and asserted that all human capacities are functions, operations; thus he opposed the mechanical materialism of a Helvetius as sharply as he did the idealism of Descartes or dualism in any form, particularly the dualism of Leibniz and Kant. He answered the question, is mind or matter primary, by asserting that both are energies and, in the last resort, identical. The distinction between them is, in his view, of historical origin, due to the division of labour in civilized society which separates thinkers from doers; and his remedy is typical of the Sturm und Drang, a practical one-thinkers must break out of their studies and begin to feel and to act. 'So sind die Theorien gestiegen, bis endlich die hochste Philosophie wieder gebietet, zur Praxis zuriickzukehren'; 'die vollstindige Wahrheit ist immer nur That'2-Goethe's Faust seems to be the quintessence of Herder's epistemological treatise. It is clear that Herder's theory powerfully reflects his own experience and feeling, his frustrations and aspirations. But we do him a serious wrong if we consider it as of merely subjective validity. His studies in language and poetry, in history and anthropology, and not least his attentiveness to contemporary science, all fortified him in his view. Too much attention has been paid to the influence of alchemy on Sturm und Drang thought, and too little to that of the best science of their time. Herder's works show a constant and growing preoccupation with scientific works. To some extent, the change-over from the mechanistic, deistic picture of the universe to the dynamic pantheistic conception is due, as Diderot several times asserted, to the rise of the biological sciences-and, we may add, to the beginnings of the science of electricity. In Vom Erkennen und Empfinden, and all later works, Herder finds substantiation for his views in the biologists' and physicists' and chemists' discovery of the energy within living organisms, within apparently 'dead' matter; and these discoveries fortified him, as they did Goethe, in his instinctive feeling of the unity of all natural phenomena, of man and nature, in his pantheism. Herder's thought, though consistent in general, is not disciplined; sometimes he seems to dissolve the universe into a 'realm of unsubstantial forces', sometimes he expresses a thoroughgoing materialism; sometimes he personalizes God as a loving father, usually he dismisses any transcendental or anthropomorphic conception of 1 For Hamann's debt, see Unger's Hamann und 2 Ubers Erkennen und Empfinden (1774). die Aufkldrung.

His philosophy is rather a starting-point than an end, and it might lead to an idealistic or a materialistic dynamic monism. There is a curious offshoot from it in Lenz's essays. Lenz, too, struggled with two opposing factors of experience: the conviction of the determination of thought by environment, as expounded for instance by Helvetius, and the conviction of the dynamic energy within himself, or at least of the irrepressible urge within him to assert himself over environment. Lenz comes to the suggestion that in this struggle the 'soul' comes into being and makes itself an independent realml-a little-known anticipation of Schelling's 'Naturphilosophie', even of the theory of 'emergent evolution'. Goethe, known to his friends as a powerful thinker, wrote very little directly upon this theme in his Sturm und Drang years. All his work testifies, however, to his feeling of unity with nature, to his awareness of the identity between the 'living forces' of nature and of man. The essay, Die Natur, of which he was the spiritual father, is his Magnificat to the author and originator of his being. Averse from philosophical generalities, he always keeps truer to observed and experienced nature than Herder. While Herder writes 'Wer seinen Sinnen nicht traut, ist ein Tor und muB ein leerer Spekulant werden ',2 Goethe avoids the pitfall of dogmatic sensualism by writing: 'Der Mensch ist genugsam ausgestattet zu allen irdischen Bediirfnissen, wenn er seinen Sinnen traut und sie dergestalt ausbildet, da3 sie des Vertrauens wert bleiben.' 3 Faust is uneasy with 'Im Anfang war die Kraft' (Herder's phraseology) and prefers the more concrete and practically helpful ' Im Anfang war die Tat'. These examples are taken from Goethe's maturity; but one finds as clear and pregnant a statement in his Sturm und Drang. What attracted him about Lavater's physiognomical studies was the identity they presupposed between spiritual qualities and physical appearance; so, in a short jotting meant to serve as a preface to the work, he sketched the guiding principle governing inner and outer change, the self and the environment: Was den Menschen umgiebt wirkt nicht allein auf ihn, er wirkt auch wieder zuriick auf selbiges, und indem er sich modificieren laBt, modificiert er wieder rings um sich her. Die Natur bildet den Menschen, er bildet sich um, und diese Umbilding ist doch wieder natuirlich.4 With the inner clarity and self-confidence that Herder so sadly lacked, Goethe finds a lucid and productive formulation that puts the new attitude in a form which directs to further intellectual and practical labour. Although Herder alone of the Stiirmer und Drdnger can claim to rank as a philo- sopher, we can, I believe, justifiably call his work the philosophy of the Sturm und Drang, since it is built out of insights and values that find other forms of expression (dramatic, lyrical, etc.) in their works and lives. It will be recognized that Schiller's way of thinking, though his dissertation deals with the 'connexion between the animal nature of man and his spiritual', stands quite apart from earlier Sturm und Drang thought; with his adoption of the basic concepts of Kant it becomes in many ways its opposite. There is no space here to investigate the extension of this basic 1 See his Meinungen eines Laien; Uber Gotz 3 Goethe, Spriiche in Prosa. von Berlichingen; and particularly Uber die 4 Goethe, Von der Physiognomik iuberhaupt.

Einige Gesprdche, and in Goethe's scientific work and Weisheit, we find its fulfilment. RELIGION It is well-known that the Stiirmer und Drdnger found in religion support, even inspiration, for their onslaught on the Aufkldrung, but it is extremely easy to misinterpret the part religion played in their thought. Almost all Hamann's works were avowedly religious in character. Herder was a clergyman; Lenz was (very fitfully) studying theology. All three were brought up in pietistic homes. Goethe kept in sympathetic touch with pietists throughout his Sturm und Drang period, and, like the others, enjoyed close personal relations with religious men like Lavater or Jung-Stilling. Yet none had sympathy with dogma or cult. Hamann was a thorn in the flesh not only of the orthodox, but also of pietists. Herder was charged with being an atheist, a free thinker, a Socinian, an enthusiast (Schwdrmer), as he told Hamann.' Goethe avowed himself a 'non-Christian .2 In the controversy over Lessing's pantheism Herder and Goethe both acknowledged themselves to be pantheists, Spinozists. Herder's first religious publications fall in 1774, when he was hoping for a Chair of Theology: one can hardly believe that either Die Alteste Urkunde des Menschenge- schlechts or Provinzialbldtter could have strengthened his claims, and he himself heard that he failed 'because his orthodoxy was in question'. The former is an ostentatious justification of the Biblical account of the Creation, directed both against rationalists who ridiculed it on rational and scientific grounds, and against theologians who tried to justify it as a symbolical expression of the truths available to modern science. Yet Herder's arguments are ambiguous in the extreme. He admits the truth of the modern cosmology of Newton and Euler and does not slur over the conflict between the conclusions of science and the statements of Genesis. But he asserts that while one is true for modern experience and consciousness, the other is equally true for the experience of the Biblical shepherds who created it. He then interprets Genesis as a mythical statement of the sunrise, and dwells upon the superiority of the ancient conception of God, which interprets the daily experience of a pastoral people, and is alive in their daily need and joy. The God of the deists is 'a metaphysical Something' that means nothing to the feeling and daily life of the individual; but this God of the patriarchs is a vital summation of their being. All truth worthy of the name must arise from experience, from the whole man-from 'Anschauen, Evidenz, Zeichen, Erfahrung'; it must lie 'im ganzen, unzerstuickten, tiefen Gefiihl der Sachen'.3 It is easy to understand the theme as a defence of the poetic value of Genesis, as a defence of the religion of a simple pastoral people; it is also clear that Herder was demanding from a religion or philosophy that it should not be a matter of mere intellectual deduction, but should arise from the totality of experience and appeal to the whole man. But few of his religious readers would have been content with his statement that the truth we arrive at is 'nichts als eine Sammlung und Fachwerk Menschlicher Begriffe, von 1 To Hamann, 13 July 1777.

The theme of the Provinzialbldtter is less ambitious and speculative; the book is made up of short homilies to parish priests. Here again we see Herder arguing against dogmatic and theological abstractions, and calling on clergymen to preach a religion that 'opens eyes and senses, ears and thoughts'. He recommends the use of the Bible because it 'nourishes most deeply the soul', because it is 'a primer for the development of human powers through the revelation of God'. There is no special organ of religion in man, the faculties are not divided into higher and lower, he says, in words that might be Hamann's: Die ganze Religionin Grund undWesenist Thatsache! Auf Zeugnisder Sinneund nicht der Oberkriifte allein; bei dem Empfangenden auf Glauben, der alle Krafte faBt, gebaut: nach Zweck und Inhalt ans Volk, den gr6ssten sinnlichern Theil der Menschheit, und nicht an Griibler gerichtet; in Art und Sprache sie mit allen Trieben umzuschaffen und zu lenken.2 It is of importance that this work was primarily concerned with the sort of religious teaching that was suited to the common mass of people, the 'greatest, more sensuous part of mankind', not to philosophers. Many times we note this preoccupation in Herder, his recognition that the common man can find no greater spiritual sustenance than in the tangible factual Biblical teaching. This is a typical Aufkldrung point of view, shared by Lessing and Voltaire, who neither of them wished to disturb the faith of the masses.3 Merck, a non-believer, likewise regretted that religion had been deprived of all its sensuous elements, its relish, and adds the characteristic remark that fortunately the 'productive class' had not been affected by this enlightened religion, and therefore 'no plough or wheel has been brought to a standstill'.4 We remember that Faust understands and fully respects Gretchen's literal faith. How far is Herder expounding his own faith, and how far is he demanding religious instruction suited to the common man, as part of his campaign against a self-centred intellectual class? It is difficult to answer this question. The duties of his office, his memories of childhood, his own impressionable and emotive nature, all combined to fill Herder's works with religious terms and tones. There is a never-ending battle in his mind. But the prevailing theme of his religious works-especially those not concerned directly with religious edification and Biblical exegesis-is 'decidedly non- Christian'. He polemises openly against the idea of a transcendental or anthropo- morphic God, he ignores problems such as sin, grace, and salvation, he is unconcerned for dogma. Religion is above all trust in the goodness of the universe, trust in the goodness of man's powers. He denies the possibility of expressing truth or the nature of God in the limited terms of human understanding. In Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte God becomes identical with an inscrutable fate, undis- cernible to human intelligence, working through entirely natural means but with a good purpose.

Einige Gesprdche, the earlier emotive exaltation at the thought of fate becomes a serene acceptance of divine Necessity, of the law governing the whole universe, in which man finds his fulfilment and his 'freedom'. In the Ideen he more fully works out his earlier idea that religion takes different forms according to the total circumstances of the life of a people. His mature philosophy, his pantheism, reconciles the idea of God with his trust in man's intellectual powers and dynamic energy-a God who lives and moves in every particle of Creation, who is justified by sense and feeling as well as thought, who is present in man's energy but who cannot be contained in any dogmatic formulation or restricted to any cult. 'This philosophy makes me very happy.' Several of Lenz's essays are theological in character, and the inconsistency of his views corresponds to the instability of his character-one finds in them theological argumentation in the style of Aufkldrung theologians, pietistic reminiscences, and moral puritanism. In his most emphatic passages, however, where we can detect a distinctive and personal note, he approximates to Herder. He writes that 'the central intention of Christ's doctrine' lies in the word METavoeZi-e- jtera! (te1'a! iiberweg iiber alle eure vorigen Meinungen von Vollkommenheit und Gluickseligkeit, uiberweg uiber euer non plus ultra, iiber euer Ideal selbst, und unauf- horlich iiberweg, solang ihr noch weiter kommt.... Glaube beschwingt, befacht, entziindet unsere Krafte alle....Es ist also der Glaube eine gewisse Zuversicht des, das man hofft.2 Religion is for Lenz, therefore, a principle of energy engaging all man's powers; and in the most profound religious poem of the Sturm und Drang, he implores God, with the violence of despair, to satisfy his heart's longings, or destroy him:3 Nein, ich schreie-Vater! Retter! Dieses Herz will ausgefiillt, Will gesattigt sein; zerschmetter Lieber sonst dein Ebenbild! The religious views of Goethe, the 'non-Christian', reflect in all essentials the same principles as Herder's. He spoke of the 'Mahrgen' of Christ, detested 'proofs' of Christianity ('Brauch ich ZeugniB dab ich binn? ZeugniB daB ich fiihle? '),4 hated dogma and dogmatists; laughed at Puritans; detested the feeling of sinful- ness and repentance, 'Zittern und Beben'; and turned in vexation from the intellectual narrowness and unproductive brooding of pietists. But he respected that faith which sustains men in the fullness of their personality, for instance the belief of Fraulein von Klettenberg or Lavater, which he recognized as the intense expression of their capacity for love and friendship. He sympathetically tolerated Jung-Stilling's naive fundamentalism, 'sein unverwiistlicher Glaube an Gott', because it was 'das Element seiner Energie'.5 In his Brief des Pastors he says that the essence of religion is 'unaussprechliche Empfindungen', while dogma is 'tyrannischer Unsinn'. 'In unsers Vaters Apotheke sind viele Rezepte'.6 He told Betty Jacobi that she should bring up her children to believe, though it was immaterial what form the belief should take: 'Ob sie an Crist glauben, oder G6tz, 1 See Herder's letters to F.

Wer an nichts glaubt verzweifelt an sich selber'.l He recalls this attitude in Dichtung und Wahrheit: Beim Glauben, sagte ich, komme Alles darauf an, daft man glaube; was man glaube, sei vollig gleichgultig. Der Glaube sei ein grol3es Gefiihl von Sicherheit fur die Gegenwart und Zukunft, und diese Sicherheit entspringe aus dem Zutrauen auf ein ubergroBles, iibermachtiges und unerforschliches Wesen.2 As we see from Faust's ' Gefiihl ist Alles', religion both interprets this subjective feeling of trust and confidence, and confirms and strengthens it, by attaching it to the whole universe, to a 'supermighty and inscrutable being' about whom it is wisest to say nothing. One may then speak of a Sturm und Drang religious philosophy. They gained from religion confidence in their own instinctive feeling, and they treasured in it those elements which sustain men in their emotive and practical life. For themselves, they let fall all the dogmatic and specific form of Christianity. 'Faith' meant for them confidence in the delight and meaning their senses, feelings, and inner energy provided. From the beginning it expressed their consciousness of forming part of nature, like all Spinozism it sanctified matter, and it sustained them in their later, more objective study of the universe, of history and nature, in which they found the same principles, the same 'mighty being', as stirred in their own hearts. Their 'religion' runs counter to the transcendentalism of the Romantics or the 'existen- tialism' of Hamann; it belongs to the great tradition of humanism and was justified, in their view, by its productive function in the totality of a man's existence. MORALS The burden of Herder's criticism of the thinkers of his century was, that everything was turned into a 'gaunt ghost', into an abstraction; philosophers, he wrote of Hume, were content 'mit Sachen zu spielen, die man brauchen und nicht besehen sollte'.3 In his view, and in this he fully represents the Sturm und Drang, ideas are meaningful only if they interpret and contribute to 'das tiefe, unersetzliche Gefiihl des Daseins',4 and as they could be realized in actual life. Actions likewise were worth doing only if they arose from, and contributed to, this vital feeling. 'Jeder handle nur ganz aus sich, nach seinem innersten Charakter, sei sich selbst treu, das ist die ganze Moral'.5 Such principles entailed a conflict, not only over the theoretical fields of philosophy and religion, but also in the region of morals. In fact, a great deal of the hostility to the Stiirmer und Dringer arose from the alleged immorality of their works. Werther was called' eine Schule des Selbstmordes', Stella 'eine Schule der Entfiihrungen und Vielweiberei .6 Faust, once it was pub- lished, was to give rise to a stream of charges against its immorality. Other Sturm und Drang works laid themselves open to the same charge, against which Schiller had to defend himself in the prefaces of his early works. Heyne, Herder's Gottingen friend and abettor, sadly regretted that Herder was so obstinately determined to banish morality from art.7 1 December 1773.

The Stiirmer und Drdnger, including Hamann, were all at odds with practical obligations, however much they sought scope for activity. They had and expressed no respect for normal burgher professions. In their manners they shocked decorous burghers and flouted public opinion. Among themselves they cultivated a frank, easy intercourse, freer and more spontaneous than propriety allowed. Goethe, above all, made himself the centre of a lively, uninhibited circle. His letters are as original in content, form and vocabulary as his poetry. Nicolai's 'rectification' of the morals of Werther is paralleled by F. H. Jacobi's criticism of Sturm und Drang lack of restraint in Eduard Allwills Papiere.1 Often enough, in the minor members of the Sturm und Drang, this spontaneity degenerated into the rampageous excess of the ' Kraftgenie', juvenile not youthful, the literary expression of which is found in such figures as Klinger's Simsone Grisaldo, in the Dedication of Maler Miiller's Fausts Leben. The self-conscious and ostentatious amoralism of Heinse's Ardinghello is the aberration of a weak and frustrated character. But it would be wrong to identify the moral challenge of the Sturm und Drang with these excesses. In some of their works, moral questions are discussed which belong to the whole trend of the Aufiklirung. The prevailing criticism of unnatural sexual continence belongs to the tradition of the Enlightenment, as does the sympathy with the victims of the harsh law against infanticide. Lenz's attack on private tuition (in Der Hofmeister) fits in with normal Aulfkldrung thought. But even in such matters, the manner of the Stirmer und Dringer is very different from that of the more cautious, socially responsible Aufkldrer; it is sharp, assertive, absolute; the evil causes not only suffering, but a dismaying perversion of character in the victims. In fact, it is from a practical point of view less effective than more restrained criticism; the attention is drawn away from thoughts of social or moral reform to absorption in the experience and response of the individual characters. The fate of Gretchen hardly moves us to reflect at all on the law governing infanticide: Faust does riot protest against it, and Gretchen herself accepts death as punishment and retribution.2 Normal reforming thought of the time sought to adjust prevailing morality to the needs of personal happiness; but, equally, it sought to adjust personal need to the unavoidable claims of social and religious authority, to the moral principles which corresponded to the social structure. The ideal of contentment implied a voluntary self-restriction and self-control; the ideal of perfection was bound up with the effort to subject instinct and feeling to reason. The sentimentalists postulated a sort of feeling which was, by its nature, virtuous and consonant with religion, and because of this, in their plays and novels, they could reward such feeling, as Sophie de la Roche rewarded her Fraulein von Sternheim with marriage and happiness. In Julie Rousseau himself described a character whose instinct is good. F. H. Jacobi and F. L. zu Stolberg continually asserted that deep feeling chimed in with Christian morals and religion. There are evidences of this view here and there in the works of the Stiirmer und Drdnger-for instance in the first version of Herder's Vom Erkennen und Empfinden.3 But for them, in general, happiness and contentment were aims to be despised, or 1 See my The novels of F. H. Jacobi and Nuf3kernen and Wagner's Die Kinderm6rderin Goethe's early classicism (English Goethe Society but in both cases it seems forced. Publications, xvI, 1947). 3 E.g. Werke, VIII, 244 passim. 2 There is criticism of this law in Muller's Das 143 ROY PASCAL</page><page sequence="16">The 'Sturm und Drang' Movement at least aims that could never be achieved; pretty pictures with which men beauti- fied the walls of their prison, in Werther's words. They sought an outlet for their feeling, room for action, experience; a perpetual movement and striving, as Lenz said, towards an infinite goal.1 They did not wish to avoid pain and effort, but accepted them as a necessity of existence, as the stuff of existence: Ich fiihle Muth, mich in die Welt zu wagen, All Erden Weh und all ihr Gluck zu tragen. Thus they were not primarily concerned to patch up the social and moral world, but to show what capacity for experience man possesses, how the world cramps and distorts the best in man. They do not provide, and scarcely suggest, solutions, for a solution would suggest that a man might come to that 'Ruhepunkt' that Lenz cursed. Or, one might say that when they suggest solutions, like Fernando's menage a trois, or Lenz's state-nursery for officers' women, they tend to the fantastic, even idiotic. But what is characteristic is that they represent the collision between the individual and morality as irremediable, fatal, something akin to the tragedy they felt in Othello, Macbeth, or Lear: one thinks of Werther and Faust, Muller's Fausts Leben, Klinger's Die Zwillinge, Lenz's Der Engldnder or Die Soldaten (Marie). Thus we find in the Sturm und Drang a double development from earlier eighteenth- century criticism of morals. On the one hand, social or moral authority and 'Sitte' is much more profoundly implicated in human tragedy; and on the other hand, the individual hero himself is in his own character much more tragic, lost. In Emilia Galotti Lessing criticizes precisely the irresponsibility of the absolute sovereign, who is the contriver of the tragedy. The victims have no share in guilt and no fault; and we feel that if the prince were 'benevolent', or if the ruler were subject to civil law, tragedy would be obviated. By contrast, in Schiller's Kabale und Liebe, the Sturm und Drang play nearest to Lessing's, one finds, instead of a mere wicked prince, a whole system of prejudice and corruption, in which the 'good' characters are lost and lose themselves. But Schiller still maintains the fiction of feelings absolutely good in themselves, which become disastrous only through the impact of evil circumstances. Goethe shows in Werther the insufferable narrowness of burgher routine and idea and the arrogance of the nobility, but also the disastrous tensions in Werther himself, which in these circumstances drive him to self-destruction. Gretchen is destroyed not merely by public opinion and law, but also by the insoluble conflict within herself between the morality she accepts and the 'goodness' of her love-a conflict within her instinct itself. Klinger's Guelfo is destroyed by his own perverted passions, as is Lenz's Marie, with her innocent desire for pleasure and elegance which the burgher world cannot satisfy. Thus Goethe felt the untruth of Sophie de la Roche's neat and precise differen- tiation between good and evil: 'Ist das b6se nicht gut und das gute nicht b6s ?'2 Werther can explain to Albert that the rational and sensible condemnation of suicide is meaningless for the loving soul cheated of its happiness. Gretchen puts it simply: it simply: Doch-alles was mich dazu trieb, Gott! war so gut! ach war so lieb ! 1 Meinungen des Laien. Schriften, Iv, 160-86. 2 To Sophie de La Roche, June 1774. Morris, iv, 22. 144</page><page sequence="17">The same contradiction exists in nature as a whole, parallel to the moral contradic- tions in man. Werther discovers the destructive power in all-creative nature, and must worship what he knows to be 'all-engulfing'. 'Schaffen und zerstoren', writes Klinger in noisy jubilation. Goethe's essay, Die Natur, is a hymn to this amoral force of nature, destroying as it creates. Death appears to them not as a bleak ending, nor as a gateway to a transcendental existence, but as the concomitant to life, as essential to life as birth.1 'Leben ist ihre schonste Erfindung [der Natur], und der Tod ist ihr Kunstgriff, viel Leben zu haben.'2 Nearly all the great works of Goethe's maturity centre in this interpretation of good and evil, and the com- pleted Faust is true to the earliest conception in this respect. The energy within Faust is his 'good'; but this good is compounded to the very end of evil and destruc- tion, not just unfortunate attendants of the good, but inescapable conditions of the good.3 It is perhaps characteristic of the 'youthfulness' of the Sturm und Drang that this problematical character of good so deeply engrossed their thought, to the (relative) exclusion of positive moral views. It is clear that Herder, Goethe, and Lenz were also aware that their views and imaginative figures represented not ideals, but the difficult truth; 'Sey ein Mann und folge mir nicht nach', Goethe affixed to the second edition of Werther. And it was quite consistent that, in working out the principles of practical existence, Goethe should both continue in the Sturm und Drang and emerge from it. But in the Sturm und Drang we see something of the profoundest significance: the fragility of established social morality and its religious sanctions is investigated; and the reluctance of the Stiirmer und Dr.inger to reconcile their dearest values with the demands of morality constitutes the deepest criticism of the social world in which such conflicts could arise, a deeper and more productive criticism than emerges from more limited, sensible, practical proposals for reform.4 Their attitude was not satisfactory; they themselves knew it, sometimes excusing themselves on the grounds of youth; but it is deeper and even to-day more moving and more disturbing than that of their contemporaries. THE FUNCTION OF POETRY It remains to investigate the relationship between their attitude to art, or rather to poetry, and the general body of their thought. I cannot hope to do more than sketch the main features of their poetic theory and work; but it is necessary to ask, not only what was their attitude towards poetry and conception of its function, but also why poetry takes so important a place in their thought and achievement. By 'poetry' should be understood imaginative literature in its widest sense, Dichtung. Even the treatises of the Stirmer und Drdnger are written in a 'poetic' style; by ellipses, ellisions, inversions, questions, unfinished sentences, colloquial phrases, they seek to present not only thoughts in the abstract, but an emotive attitude, a response, gesture, a tone of voice. Herder insisted that truth is compounded of sense, thought, and will, that abstract language interprets the dessicated Stuben- qelehrter and that man in his fullness needs for self-expression a much richer language. Good German, Herder wrote, is to-day spoken only by the uneducated sections of society, children, young women, artisans and practical folk, and thus the poetic 1 Herder, Gott. Einige Gesprdche.

XLVII 10 145 ROY PASCAL</page><page sequence="18">The 'Sturm und Drang' Movement language of the Stiirmer und Drdnger was deeply refreshed through the rehabilitation of the vocabulary, phraseology, and rhythms of vigorous colloquial speech. At the same time, they did not confine themselves to the limited range of the Volk, but borrowed widely from poetic language which has in it the power they sought Pindar, Homer, Shakespeare, folksong. Goethe was able to marry the earthiness of the Knittelvers with the sublimity of deepest thought and emotion. In accordance with their attacks on metaphysical and dogmatic idealism, they overthrew the authority of the Rules; and at the same time the notion that poetry is mere embellishment. Poetry, they felt, must be meaningful within the experience of the individual poet, not constructed on some abstract principle. Herder's delight in early poetry, in folksong, was due to his perception that this poetry was a creative element in social and personal life, the accompaniment of social tasks, battle and work, 'die Entziickung, die Triebfeder, der ewige Erb- und Lustgesang des Volks '.' He continually criticized poets like Gessner who substituted a pretty or sentimental world for the true one; the only true poetry he told Caroline, was that which stirs the passions, 'the springs of mankind'.2 The essay on Ossian is devoted to this theme of the active function of poetry in simple society, in the Volk. But, in a time where there was no real national community, Herder recognized that Klopstock had marked the way for the renewal of poetry-a poetry of individual experience, expressing the individual's deepest emotions-' Gefiihl ganzer Situation des Lebens! Gesprach Menschlichen Herzens-mit Gott! mit sich! mit der ganzen Natur!'3 And if Klopstock failed him through his excessive etherealism, Goethe came fully to realize Herder's principles. Hamann had put the same view in his sybilline way in Aesthetica in nuce. Here he asserted that art is the expression of the divine force through the creative reproduction of nature, and that it must speak to sense and passions, the organs of the Divine. Poetry is no place for trivialities and abstractions; it must be characteristic, concrete, individual, not idealizing nature but reproducing its vigour and working vigorously upon the reader.4 This rupture with the old idea of absolute rules led in some respects to a disregard of form altogether. Hamann showed a complete failure to appreciate form.5 The first response to Shakespeare led Herder and Goethe to see his works as 'history 'the world', 'a raree show'. Lenz compares the ideas of the poet to an unruly garrison, which may' ohne Anfiihrer, Kommando und Ordnung herumschwarmen '.6 Many Sturm und Drang works show a deliberate flouting of accepted formal principles, even of necessary technical conditions such as the stage imposes. The genius, they could believe, was above rules. Abandoning the rules associated with the principle of verisimilitude, Herder, following Gerstenberg, asserted that the poet's task is to create illusion, to impose his own world on us.' Often the essence of the Sturm und Drang is held to be a cult of wilful 'genius'. But their critical and poetic work shows in fact a new and profound insight into the problem of form-so difficult and elusive a problem that it is not surprising that their formulations are not always consistent. In the Fragmente, Herder was always 1 Briefwechsel iiber Ossian. Werke, v, 164. Kunstrichter and Schriftsteller und Kunstrichter. 2 ToCaroline,20September 1770.

WTerke, v, 215, 226-8. 146</page><page sequence="19">struggling with this problem, investigating the characteristics and determinants of poetic language and poetic traditions, in order to discover the secret of the variations and function of form. His great review of Klopstock's odes shows his understanding of, the formal properties of these poems, each with its own tone and colour, with a form which arises from the nature of the theme.1 The Ossian essay is an extended investigation of the formal properties of folksong, so different from those conven- tionally required. Above all in the Shakespeare essay, Herder shows how the form of Greek and Shakespearean drama is of equal validity, since each arose from a mass of historical conditions, social, religious, and artistic, through which they acquired their deep human significance. He comes to the idea of organic form: a form he calls comparable to that of nature, which gives 'jedem Kraut, Gewachse und Thier seine Gestalt, Sinn und Art, die Individuel ist und eigentlich nicht verglichen werden kann'.2 This is the theme of Goethe's rhapsody over the Strassburg Minster. He seeks to understand Gothic architecture as the development of the primitive hut, as a natural process, and concludes: 'wie in Werken der ewigen Natur, bis aufs geringste Zaserchen, alles Gestalt, und alles zweckend zum Ganzen.'3 Herder's aesthetic historicism is of capital importance in the history of aesthetics as well as of literary criticism; beauty, he asserted in conformity with his general philosophy, is not an abstract ideal, but a product of a dialectical relationship between subject and object, between a society and nature, a man's experience and his environment. Goethe supplemented Herder's general critical insight by equally significant remarks on the formal element in poetic creation. Even Lenz realized, at times, that the poet was not an arbitrary creator, but created according to principles which followed from his standpoint, his experience.4 In Von deutscher Baukunst Goethe speaks of the 'bildende Natur' in man; in the Dritte Wallfahrt he writes that 'Sch6pfungskraft im Kuinstler sey aufschwellendes Gefiihl der Verhalt- nisse, Maase'. If Herder wrote of the 'Nothdrang des Inhalts' of early poetry, Goethe puts the same idea in the image of the charioteer, guiding his spirited horses according to his will, guiding them though at the same time carried along with them.5 'Alles schreibens anfang und Ende ist die Reproduktion der Welt um mich, durch die innre Welt die alles packt, verbindet, neuschafft, knetet und in eigner Form, Manier, wieder hinstellt.'6 Burger seems to echo Goethe when he writes that the poet must have the courage 'ein Ding zu packen, zu halten, zu schleudern und in die Luft emporzureissen'.7 But by contrast Goethe's remarks emphasize that the poet is not so arbitrary with his material, that the form it takes is partly determined by its own nature. So, when Goethe wrote his comments on L. S. Mercier's Du theatre, he emphasized above all the problem of form. One must remember, he says, that the stage is an artificial structure, and must study and observe the conditions it imposes; the drama is not a 'raree show', but must have form. All form is artificial, but it is the way in which reality, truth, may be presented to the soul of man. 'Jede Form, auch 1 Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliotheke (1773). 5 To Herder, 10 July 1772.

Thus, in the later part of the jottings, Goethe refuses to take sides in the great contemporary controversy over the relative merits of Rembrandt, Raphael and Rubens; each in his view is great in that he presents the world as he experiences it. 'Der Kiinstler mag die Werkstatte eines Schusters betreten oder einen Stall, er mag das Gesicht seiner Geliebten, seine Stiefel oder die Antike ansehen, uberall sieht er die heiligen Schwingungen und leisen Tone, womit die Natur alle Gegen- stande verbindet.'l Goethe defines the attitude of the artist to his material as 'love , a love which discovers in the object the same harmonies, proportions, 'holy vibrations', as the poet feels within himself. These jottings, which belong to the end of his Sturm und Drang period, and perhaps prepare us for the preoccupation with art in the early Weimar years, interpret both the widening of aesthetic appreciation by the Stilrmer und Drdnger, and their own search for an individual form, consonant with their mode of experience and their inner values, such as Goethe found for his lyrics, for Werther and for Faust. Hamann had combated the conception that art must beautify nature by justi- fying nature and the senses as creations and instruments of the Divine; but he had also rebelled against contemporary realistic theories of art, e.g. that of Diderot, since they denied the imagination and feeling their proper function. 'Willkiihr und Phantasie' are essential, he cries, to art.2 His own imagination ran to caprice, there is no doubt; but he raises here a problem that lies at the heart of the Sturr und Drang: the relation of imagination and reality. These two elements in their work were noted by Justus Moser. He praised the healthy grasp of the real world shown in their best writings, and at the same time ascribed such realism to the poet's ability to 'schopfen aus sich selbst und seine Empfindungen allein ausdriicken'.3 It is a peculiar and often ignored achievement of the Sturm und Drang to have 'reproduced' actual reality with an intensity no German generation of the nine- teenth century surpassed.4 It is true that German literature, for Wordsworth, was distinguished by a delight in the fantastic and macabre that he properly detested, and some works of the Sturm und Drang show an unhappy indulgence in unreal fantasies. Herder complained of his own 'aufgeschwellte Einbildungskraft' which tended to 'distort' reality grotesquely,5 and Merck addressed to him the sympathetic words: 'Ewig wirst du Traume jagen.'6 Goethe wrote the lines:7 Doch du warst mein Zeitvertreib Goldne Phantasie. Lenz suffered immeasurably, in his life and works, from 'imaginaire Leiden', from an inability to see the world clear and true. Yet this was a tendency they all sought to combat, training themselves to observe objectively, to pierce through the mist 1 Aus Goethes Brieftasche. Morris, v, 344-50. 5 Herder, Journal meiner Reise.

Merck wrote of Faust: 'es ist ein Werk, das mit der grossten Treue der Natur abgestohlen ist.'1 He criticized minor works of the Sturm und Drang because they were taken from 'dunkle Traume poetischer Begierde', instead of the 'Markt des Lebens',2 and Goethe attributes to him the salutary advice: 'Dein Bestreben, deine unablenkbare Richtung, ist, dem Wirk- lichen eine poetische Gestalt zu geben; die andern suchen das sogenannte Poetische, das Imaginative zu verwirklichen, und das gibt nichts als dummes Zeug.'3 Merck's attitude on these points was in full conformity with the main tendency of the Sturm und Drang. Lenz felt it necessary to excuse the 'willkiihrliche Aus- schweifungen der Phantasie' of Der Englinder, and proudly claimed Die Soldaten was taken from life.4 Herder wrote of early poetry that it 'webt um daseiende Gegenstande, Hand- lungen, Begebenheiten, um eine lebendige Welt'. In like manner, all the Stiirmer und Drdnger sought to interpret in their works their actual experience. But they rejected any dogmatic realism, realism for its own sake; they sought to reproduce that reality which had significance for them, for which they had 'love', to use Goethe's word. The realism of Nicolai's Sebaldus Nothanker was tedious and dispensable for them. Goethe demanded that the poet should describe his own circumstances, his own feelings; then his poetry would have poetical worth.5 'Nur da, wo Vertraulichkeit, BediirfniB, Innigkeit wohnen, wohnt alle Dichtungs- kraft.... Geh vom Hauslichen aus und verbreite dich, so du kannst, fiber alle Welt.'6 The 'burning-glass' of the poet alters this reality, the imagination uses all sorts of 'unreal' instruments, metaphors, rhyme, images, 'den dunklen Gang der Melodie', supernatural figures and symbolic events; but these unrealistic means serve to interpret a human reality, in which nature and things are impregnated with human vitality, and vice versa. It is a remarkable feature of Urfaust that Goethe has stripped the folkplay of almost all its macabre and fantastic elements, and that what he retains or invents is of direct human relevance. This poetic realism is characteristic of all his work; it infinitely surpasses the flat realism of Lessing in that it calls into play a great mass of feelings and responses, and sets the reader vibrating with the work; it is of course equally different from the empty subjectivism of much German romanticism. With him, the imaginative is not the opposite of the real; it is a means of evoking and interpreting the real. Imagination is something akin to what it was in Wordsworth, a means of deepest insight and sympathy.7 It is, as Goethe later called it, a surmise, an anticipation of reality;8 not as with the German romantics or Coleridge an alternative to experienced reality, the organ of a transcendental world. Even before Goethe met Herder, he detested the unreality of Klopstockian enthusiasm, and yet could see 'auch ein Mahrgen hat seine Wahrheit'.9 Illusion and reality were interwoven for him, as companions in the developing process of life: Ich hatte nichts und doch genug, Den Drang nach Wahrheit und die Lust am Trug.

Poetry therefore acquires a new meaning for the Stiirmer und Drdnger, or rather they understand the meaning great poetry always has had. It is not embellishment, not a routine craft, not the handmaiden of established morality or a pleasant way of uttering moral or philosophical arguments. It is a mode of grasping reality and strengthening men's full participation in life, both in the process of poetic appreciation and in that of poetic creation. Herder expresses over and over again the feeling of vigorous joy, the enhancement of his vital consciousness, that he gained from folk-poetry, which 'uns ganz einnimmt, uns aber doch nie zu etwas mehr als Menschen macht'.1 Shakespeare gave him the same sense of human power and dignity. Goethe wrote how, on reading Shakespeare for the first time, he felt his existence 'um eine Unendlichkeit erweitert'2-Wilhelm Meister uses almost the same expression. K. P. Moritz, whose autobiography gives us something of the basic 'Problematik' of the Stiirmer und Drdnger, wrote in a similar strain: Nachdem er den Shakespear, und so wie er ihn gelesen hatte, war er schon kein gemeiner und alltiglicher Mensch mehr-es dauerte auch nun nicht lange, so arbeitete sich sein Geist unter allenseinen auBern druckenden Verhaltnissen, unter allem Spott und Verachtung, worunter er vorher erlag, empor.... Durch den Shakespear war er die Welt der menschlichen Leidenschaften hindurch gefiihrt-der enge Kreis seines idealischen Daseyns hatte sich erweitert-er lebte nicht mehr so einzeln und unbedeu- tend, da1 er sich unter der Menge verlor. He described the effect of Werther in similar terms, for after reading it he no longer thought of himself as 'ein unbedeutendes weggeworfenes Wesen'.3 Lenz demanded from poetry 'Zuwachs unserer Existenz', 'den lebendigen Eindruck, der sich in Gesinnungen, Taten und Handlungen hernach einmischt'.4 So also, poetic creation was for the Stiirmer und Drdnger a function of living, necessary in their effort to develop the totality of their capacities. Often enough their works express too directly their own too personal needs and frustrations, and fail to impart that enhanced consciousness of human worth which came to them from Shakespeare. Moritz' powerful response to Klinger's Die Zwillinge shows exactly where this play fails, for it only increased his 'Abscheu vor sich selbst'.5 Goethe, incomparably the greatest poet of the Sturm und Drang, repeatedly seeks words to indicate the function of poetic creation in himself. He compares art with the instinct of animals 'sich gegen die zerstorende Kraft des Ganzen zu erhalten ;6 '0 wenn ich ietzt nicht Dramas schriebe ich ging zu Grund. ' And, more subtly, he describes himself immer in sich lebend, strebend und arbeitend, bald die unschuldigen Gefiihle der Jugend in kleinen Gedichten, das krafftige Gewiirze des Lebens in mancherley Dramas, die Gestalten seiner Freunde und seiner Gegenden und seines geliebten Hausraths mit Kreide auf grauem Papier, nach seiner Maase auszudriicken sucht, weder rechts noch lincks fragt: was von dem gehalten werde was er machte? weil er arbeitend immer gleich eine Stufe hoher steigt, weil er nach keinem Ideale springen, sondern seine Gefiihle sich zu Fahigkeiten, kimpfend und spielend, entwickeln lassen will.7 The sentence is a whole aesthetic. Experience and environment provide the material 1 Herder to Caroline, 28 October 1770. 5 Anton Reiser, ed. cit. p. 302.

Reflecting later in life on the imperious inner necessity that drove him to write Werther, Goethe wrote that the composition of this work had 'saved' him from the 'stormy element' -'Ich fiihlte mich, wie nach einer Generalbeichte, wieder froh und frei und zu einem neuen Leben berechtigt'.1 This exalted vital function that poetry had for the Stiirmer und Drdnger, in theory and practice, explains in part why so much of their work was concerned with imaginative writing. Poetry was not at end in itself, but a means to life, to activity. With such a purpose, the limitations and pettiness of their social world gave to poetry a peculiar significance. Their ideals crashed against actuality, and we see the reflexion of this fateful collision in work after work, above all in Werther and Faust; in the imagination, in the imaginative self-projection of their works, the intensity of being'which was their ideal could be realized. Professor Bruford has brought out the significance of the fact that the theatre was the only public forum in eighteenth-century Germany,2 and this circumstance, combined with the tensions and 'pungent spice' of their experience, accounts for the predominant significance of the drama in the Sturm und Drang. Lenz expresses the point with rueful whimsi- cality, when he writes that the best his friends can do, since they are 'stumme Personen auf dem grossen Theater der Welt', 'da uns itzt noch Hande und FiiBe gebunden sind', is to put Gotz on the stage and learn from Gotz how to think and behave.3 In poetry they could express that fullness of being they sought, could see it in relation to the outer world, could follow some of its implications; through poetic appreciation and poetic activity they could release some of their actual stresses, could come to clearer self-understanding, could move towards that 'Lauterung' of which Goethe often writes in the late Frankfurt and early Weimar period. Only Goethe was so favoured, both in personality and in outward circum- stance, as to be able to move forward in a steady development; and one sees in his assumption of practical duties at Weimar, in his scientific interests, in the steady broadening of his life, the true fulfilment of the Sturm und Drang, according to the possibilities that German society offered. There has been no space in this article to discuss all aspects of the life and thought of the Stiirmer und Drdnger, nor to go into all the variations among them and investigate weaknesses and failures. It would have been rewarding to have examined more fully their debt to their great foreign contemporaries, and the points at which they strike off on their own independent line. The contrast between them and men like Lavater, Burger, Stolberg would reveal much of value. But perhaps sufficient has been done to establish the very considerable range of their ideas and works, particularly of the outstanding personalities, and to show how consistent their outlook was, and how consistent was their practice and their poetical work with their general principles. In reviewing the whole movement, their achievement seems to stand more centrally than is generally recognized in the main stream of European intellectual and artistic development, in regard both to its sources, and to the generations that followed.
