<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang  Cosmology, North-Central  Arnhem Land Craig Elliott Central Land Council Introduction In a 1977 conference paper, ‘Ambiguity in Yolngu Religious Language’,  Keen identified conceptual ambiguity as a critical cultural mechanism by which  economies of knowledge and local group identities are reproduced in Arnhem  Land thought and social life. The ethnographic interpretation of Yolngu  conceptual indeterminancy produced a rich preoccupation in Keen’s scholarship.  This and related subjects were elaborated in his PhD thesis, ‘One Ceremony,  One Song’ (1978), Knowledge and Secrecy in an Aboriginal Religion (1994) and in  ‘Metaphor and the Metalanguage’ (1995). The 1977 paper highlighted the role of  song language, within shared mythologies, in the process of creating difference  amidst underlying socio-religious sameness (1977: 33). His thesis examined how  a ‘same song’ interpretive technique both links and differentiates ownership  of religious sacra in Yolngu belief and ceremonial practice (1978:  210–15;  1994: 132–64). These sources significantly contribute to understanding how  constructs in the religious domain create and distribute social meanings in the  Arnhem Land landscape, themes this paper pursues. 101 </page> <page sequence="2"> Strings of Connectedness It is well recognised that cosmological and social classificatory systems  routinely contain indeterminacies and ambiguities (Keen 1995: 507). In Arnhem  Land cosmologies, little sociolinguistic distinction is made between corporeal  and incorporeal entities (see Keen 1978: 42). Nor are sharp distinctions made  about the conceptual aspects and boundaries of cosmological categories— anthropomorphic spirit beings, for example. It is therefore not surprising that  many motifs convey a range of significations through analogy. Meaningful  cultural interpretations are not entirely open-ended, but cued and referenced  by local mythological, environmental, ceremonial and social contexts. For these  reasons, while still noting that typologies exist, Keen rightly cautions against  the categorisation of Arnhem Land spirit beings using ‘unequivocal criteria’  (1994: 45). For Marrangu Djinang cosmology in north-central Arnhem Land, Borsboom  (1978a, 1978b, 2011) and I (1991) have provided ethnographic evidence  and analyses highlighting similar reservations. Specifically regarding the  representation of Merri1 and Mewal, two anthropomorphic spirit beings in  Marrangu Djinang cosmology, there are richly multilayered and ambiguous  significations at work. This paper first outlines Marrangu Djinang sociality,  focusing on land and Arnhem Land local organisation, with reference to  Keen’s (1995) critique of that subject. The paper then employs a strongly local  ethnographic perspective to describe and explain overlapping and ambiguous  attributes of Merri and Mewal. The paper focuses on Merri and Mewal’s  importance in the local environment and in Marrangu Djinang cosmology,  song,  ceremony, and mortality and affliction beliefs. The analysis proceeds  with Keen’s caution concerning unequivocal analytical categorisation of Yolngu  ontological concepts firmly in mind. Marrangu Djinang Land and Identity The physical environment of north-central Arnhem Land is dominated by dry  eucalyptus forest and Darwin stringybark (Eucalyptus tetradonta) in particular.  The eucalypt forests of Marrangu Djinang country are drained by two  watercourses, Djimbi and Gattji Creeks. North of the forest areas are seasonally  flooding and semi-tidal lowlands. Here Gattji and Djimbi Creeks peter out: the  former into a series of swamps; the latter into a jungle waterhole. Mangrove-lined  saltwater estuary systems, tidal plains and mud flats, and a band of paperbark  swamps cut across the northern (near-coastal) part of Marrangu country. 1  Spelt ‘Mere’ by Borsboom (1978a, 1978b), who also spells Marrangu with one ‘r’ only. 102 </page> <page sequence="3"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land Figure 5.1 Location Map—North-central Arnhem Land, Australia. Source: Craig Elliott. The homelands Galawdjapin and Gattji are located beside Gattji Creek.2 Gattji is  a traditional Wulaki place of residence and is a ‘big name’ place.3 Missionaries  from Milingimbi Mission visited Gattji prior to World War II, established a garden  there and exchanged goods such as tea, sugar, flour, jam, cloth and tobacco for  sacred objects. Gattji and another Djinang outstation, ‘Gillere’ (Gulidi), were  visited by Donald Thomson (see Peterson 1976: 104) in 1936–37. Galawdjapin  was established as a homeland much more recently, in 1974. At that time several  Marrangu, Mildjingi and Ganalbingu people left Maningrida, where most had  been resident since the early 1960s, and moved back to ancestral lands. Keen (1995) has thoroughly critiqued the inadequacy of simplistic, taxonomical  anthropological constructs such as ‘clan’, ‘phratry’, ‘dialect’ and ‘tribe’ to explain  Arnhem Land local organisation. Keen argues much ethnographic description  consists of converting conceptual metaphors viewed as ‘causal’ by the subjects  of the ethnography, into the ‘symbolic’ semantic domain of the anthropological  metalanguage (ibid.: 504–5). Examples of this conversion process in Arnhem  Land ethnography, Keen argues, are variations of mala into ‘clan’; matha as  ‘dialect group’; and ba:purru as ‘phratry’ (ibid.: 506–7). Comparing early and  2  The part of this watercourse adjacent to and south of Galawdjapin homeland is named Galawdjapin Creek. 3  While Gattji is on Wulaki country, the contemporary population there is majority Marrangu Djinang.  Marrangu people live at Gattji by virtue of (generations of) intermarriage, and thereby are able to ‘look after’  Wulaki land, their mother’s country. 103 </page> <page sequence="4"> Strings of Connectedness later analyses, the ethnographic record of Arnhem Land contains anomalies  and inconsistencies in the interpretative conversion of Yolngu concepts into  anthropological categories (ibid.: 507, Table 1). As an ethnographic region,  Arnhem Land is far from unique in exhibiting inconsistency between early and  later ethnographers’ interpretations of local concepts. Marrangu Djinang4 sociality exhibits layers of interconnected local organisation  based on the reference points of language, land, kin and Dreaming narrative.  I elucidate these layers with reference to the relevant Djinang terms and the  anthropological labels with greatest continuing, albeit contested, currency in  the literature. I do so mindful of the undoubted and pervasive inadequacies of  the hierarchical anthropological models purporting to represent Arnhem Land  concepts, as critiqued by Keen. The Djinang-speaking Marrangu mala or clan belongs to the Dhuwungi  patrimoiety.5 The residential population of Galawdjapin and Gattji is made up of  the local Marrangu Djinang landowners, their affines, children and individuals  from adjacent clan lands who normally intermarry with Marrangu Djinang.  Mala whose countries either border, have reciprocal food-gathering rights with  Marrangu Djinang people, and/or whose country Marrangu Djinang people djaga  (‘look after’)6 are Wulaki, Yalungirri, Djadiwitjibi, Murrungun,7 Rembarrnga,8  Ganalbingu and Balmbi. Marrangu Djinang people have guardianship rights in  the sense meant by Morphy (1984: 28–9) over the territory one of these groups,  Rembarrnga, because the original Rembarrnga-speaking mala is extinct. Both  Wulaki and Ganalbingu mala intermarry with Marrangu Djinang people, and  thus ‘look after’ their mother’s country. This means they have rights to paint  their ‘mother’ clan’s Dreamings and are obliged to perform certain ceremonial  duties for their ‘mother’ clan. Other clan countries Marrangu Djinang people  ‘look after’, and call ‘mother’, are Djadiwitjibi, Mildjingi and Murrungun  (all Yirritjing moiety). 4  I employ the label ‘Marrangu Djinang’ in the paper title and throughout mindful of the history and  reported inconsistencies of such labels in the ethnographic literature (for example, see Berndt 1976: 145–59;  and Keen 1995: 508). The label ‘Marrangu Djinang’ has some similarities with Berndt’s ‘mada [matha]-mala  pair’, in that it combines socio-religious and linguistic elements. It is only in their combination, consistent  with the usage in this paper, that Marrangu Djinang denotes a local territory with focal sites and affiliated set  of people and sacra. Each term—Marrangu and Djinang—when employed separately has potential to denote  a range of additional cultural references. 5  Dhuwungi is the Djinang name for the patrimoiety known in northeast Arnhem Land as Dhuwa or Dua.  The Djinang name for the opposite patrimoiety is Yirritjing (known in northeast Arnhem Land as Yirritja). For  an account of the Dhuwungi moiety foundational Djang’kawu mythology, see Bagshaw (2008: 33–7). 6  See Berndt (1976: 156) and Keen (1995: 513) for comparable usages of this term. 7  This is a Wulaki-speaking, Yirritjing moiety Murrungun clan, not the Dhuwungi moiety Murrungun  clan associated with the Djareware (Wild Honey) Dreaming. 8  ‘Rembarrnga’ is included here in its mala or clan sense. ‘Rembarrnga’ is also a matha or dialect name. 104 </page> <page sequence="5"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land Marrangu is also the name that identifies the group of mala (clans) that share a  single Dreaming track or property (baparru or ba:purru, babaru, bapurru). In the  Marrangu case, the shared Dreaming is Djareware or Yarrpany (Wild Honey  or Sugar Bag).9 Social and ceremonial interconnectedness through baparru is a  feature of mala organisation across Arnhem Land (see Morphy 1990: 316; Keen  1995: 514–6; Bagshaw 2008: 32–3), although inclusive interrelationships based  upon language (yan), dialect (matha), territoriality and intermarriage (djungkai/ djunggayi) and reciprocal ceremonial ties are also significant. Based on my research with Marrangu Djinang people, the term baparru  has a number of applications. Primarily, baparru refers to the aggregate of  same-patrimoiety mala that share a Dreaming (or other form of madayin or  religious property) and whose countries contain sites named in that story.10  At Galawdjapin and Gattji the word baparru-a is further used to denote the  gathering of kin at a burial and its associated ceremonies. Others (for example,  Berndt 1955: 96; Thomson 1975: 6; Hiatt 1965: 20) have noted interchangeable  usages of baparru and mala elsewhere in Arnhem Land, suggesting baparru may  mean both the Dreaming-based affiliations of several mala (the sense used here)  and the patrilineal landowning group mala. My research at Galawdjapin and  Gattji recorded the former usage of baparru, though the term undoubtedly has  extended applications (see Keen 1995: 514). Additional to Marrangu Djinang, the Marrangu baparru consists of Dhuwungi  patrimoiety mala with the following names and geographical affiliations:11  Murrungun (Raymangirr, near Lake Evella/Gapuwiyak)12; Djambarrpuyngu  (Elcho Island, Galiwin’ku); Wagilak (Roper River); Burarra (Glyde River);  Marrakulu (Trial Bay); and Kulumula (Wessel Islands13). According to Djinang  Marrangu, all these mala may be identifiable as ‘Marrangu’ and form part  of the Marrangu baparru. The mala that make up the Marrangu baparru are  geographically widespread, located along the northwesterly journey of the  Djareware (Wild Honey) Dreaming track. On this basis, all Marrangu mala are  said to share ‘one track’ and, despite linguistic differences, ‘one song’. 9  As is explained below, the Marrangu Djinang version of this mythology, Mewal and Djareware Dreaming,  is a variation highlighting localised events and interrelationships within this more broadly shared mythology. 10  Keen (1995: 514–5) describes similar applications of the term ‘ba:purru’. This kind of configuration has  been called ‘phratry’ by Warner (1937/1958: 33) and ‘totemic unions’ by Shapiro (1981: 23). 11  I recognise that the labels noted here are not used in an entirely consistent way to denote a singular  ‘level’ of social organisation. Each of the names cited here operates as a linguistic label, as well as being part  of mala and baparru formations. For example, Djambarrpuyngu refers to a linguistic unit, a patrifilial group  and an aggregation of several patrifilial groups (Peter Toner, personal communication). It is reasonable to say  that Arnhem Landers use a range of self-referential names, and a range to refer to others. Each label can,  depending on the logic of the social and geographical context, represent a more or less inclusive ‘level’ of  group representation. 12  Clan territory locations are approximations only. 13  Ian Keen (personal communication). 105 </page> <page sequence="6"> Strings of Connectedness Mala making up the Marrangu baparru exchange closely related and  ceremonially powerful sacred property (madayin), such as names, songs,  ceremonial acts and objects, between each other, and direct ceremonies such as  mortuary rites on each other’s behalf. The high value placed upon knowledge  and ownership of such property (designs, sand sculpture, ceremonies and songs)  means these exchanges are an important expression of both mala autonomy  and baparru interconnectedness. Taylor (1987: 381) has observed that baparru  is a highly abstract concept with little bearing upon on-the-ground groupings,  but that baparru relations between mala highlight the notion that spiritual  unity transcends geographic, political and linguistic differences. Mala within  the same baparru do not share in toto the same Dreaming property as each  other. Along their shared Dreaming track, each mala highlights (in song and  ceremonies) mythic aspects most relevant to themselves and their country.  Marrangu Djinang emphasise that part of the Djareware’s journey that occurs  along Djimbi Creek. Similarly, while both Djambarrpuyngu and Marrangu  Djinang sing Stringybark tree manikay, each emphasises slightly different  aspects. This custom is typically described as ‘same but different’—a feature  axiomatic of baparru relations in Arnhem Land. Other names, all referencing local cosmology, regarded as uniquely identifying  Marrangu Djinang mala are Warnambi, Wurrkiganydjarr,14 Mewal and  Mungurrpi. Warnambi and Wurrkiganydjarr both relate to the Stringybark tree;  Warnambi to the tree itself while Wurrkiganydjarr denotes ‘stringybark flower’  (Borsboom 1978b: 28). Literally, ‘wurrkiganydjarr’ translates as ‘flower power’,  ‘wurrki’ means flower while ‘ganydjarr’ means ‘power, ability, strength, stamina’  (Waters 1983: 41, 114).15 Mewal, the Spirit Being companion of Djareware, is a  term used by others to address Djinang Marrangu people in public spaces, such  as at nearby Ramingining. The rarely employed fourth term, Mungurrpi, refers  to Marrangu Djinang people at Galawdjapin. The Marrangu Djinang mala is made up of ‘bottom’ and ‘top’ parts or companies,  known as Nongere (or Mongon or Mongonirri) and Guraknere, respectively,  with roughly similar numbers.16 Most Nongere individuals live at Galawdjapin  and Gattji; and most Guraknere (or ‘top’) Marrangu Djinang reside at or near  Ramingining. The division has a mythological foundation, when the Djareware  14  Spelt ‘Wurgigandjar’ by Borsboom (1978a, 1978b). 15  The name ‘Wurrkiganydjarr’ was given to the Djinang Marrangu people by another clan, the  Djambarrpuyngu-speaking Marrangu clan (Borsboom 1978b: 28). 16  Taylor’s Kunwinjku informants translated the word ‘company’, in the context of intra-clan division,  as ‘follow each other’, ‘mix together’, ‘we share’ and ‘all one family’ (1987: 86–7). I received virtually  identical glosses relating to Nongere and Guraknere. Additional to intra-clan divisions, however, ‘company’ is  frequently used by Marrangu people to describe intermarrying clans (that is, between clans in a ‘mother’ or  djungkai relationship). There is some crossover in these two senses of ‘company’, since the intra-clan Nongere  and Guraknere subgroups structure marriage arrangements with djungkai clans. See also Keen’s (1978: 214)  findings concerning ‘company’ usage at Milingimbi. 106 </page> <page sequence="7"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land (Honey) Being used a stone axe to cut Marrangu country into two parts, thus  forming Nongere and Guraknere (Borsboom 1978b: 72). The interrelationship  is further imaged in body metaphor, in that Guraknere means the neck or apex  of the spine (hence ‘top’) while Nongere denotes the ‘bottom’ of the spine.17  Both Nongere and Guraknere contain sites connected with Djareware Dreaming  and both are considered owners of all Marrangu Djinang land and the spiritual  property associated with it, but each differs in relationship to neighbouring  clans. For example, Nongere Marrangu is adjacent to Wulaki country, whereas  Guraknere Marrangu country, to the southeast, adjoins Ganalbingu country.  Nongere Marrangu marry with the Wulaki-speaking mala named Djelaworwor,  and are thus djungkai for Wulaki country, whereas Guraknere Marrangu marry  with their Ganalbingu-speaking neighbours and have djungkai responsibilities  towards Ganalbingu mala territory. Mewal and Merri in Marrangu Djinang  Cosmological Landscapes Merri and Mewal are anthropomorphic spirit beings believed to inhabit the  Marrangu Djinang landscape, and are attributed significations in ceremonial  practices, especially mortuary rites, and bodily experience. The local founding  narrative in Marrangu Djinang belief is the Mewal and Djareware (Wild Honey)  Dreaming. In this mythology, Mewal, imaged as part bee and part woman,  collected honey in Marrangu Djinang country (as people continue to do).  As  a  substance containing eggs, in Marrangu belief honey contains ‘spirit  children’, and therefore conceptive power. Mewal is also an emblem of Marrangu  Djinang origins, identity and continuity, through transformative acts such as  the designation of places in Marrangu country as ‘Mewal’ sites; the symbolic  use of white down body decoration in Marrangu ceremonies; and in the Mewal  ceremonies (bunggul), enacted during mortuary rites, where the deceased’s  bones become emblems of ancestral and clan regeneration. The Djareware  Dreaming unites all Marrangu clans but Mewal, as an entity within this mythic  tradition specific to Marrangu Djinang, highlights the clan’s identity within  overall baparru organisation. But Mewal is not all ‘good’ in Marrangu Djinang cosmological symbolism.  Mewal is ‘bad, but him not all bad’, as revered Marrangu ancestor Dick Miwirri  (now deceased) once told me. In the Mewal and Djareware Dreaming, Mewal  inhabits monsoonal jungles. These localised landscapes are both impenetrable  17  Body imagery as metaphors for social group constitution and reproduction are elaborate and pervasive in  Arnhem Land; see Keen (1978: 281–334; 1995: 509–13). 107 </page> <page sequence="8"> Strings of Connectedness physical environments and symbolically unsocialised, malignant realms in  Marrangu cosmology. The significance of Mewal as founder of clan identity is  thus multilayered, complicated by association with these symbolically malign  cosmological ‘landscapes’. Mewal joins Merri, the other Marrangu Djinang  anthropomorphic spirit being, to roam in the jungle at night, making distracting  sounds so people lose direction. In this form, Mewal is believed a corruption of  the human body, ugly, deformed or skeletal only. In behaviour this Mewal is  asocial, and, like Merri, evokes negative sentiments associated with the physical  (and cosmological) jungle environment. Alongside this, Mewal is believed to  have interacted congenially with the earliest human beings, teaching them and  bestowing rights in songs18 and dances (that is, madayin property). The belief  that words in manikay (clan songs) are learnt from the spirits of the dead  exemplifies this interaction. There are 13 Marrangu Djinang manikay song subjects. The manikay songs  celebrate the actions of Dreaming (Wangarr) beings including, in the present  case, Djareware, Mewal and Merri.19 In manikay performance, each song consists  of formulaic recitations of name words20 that connote interrelationships within  Marrangu Djinang land and cosmology. The 13 Marrangu Djinang manikay  songs are sung in a consistent (though, in practice, rarely identical) order and  are thematically grouped, shown in Table 5.1. The left-hand column lists the 13  Marrangu Djinang manikay song subjects21; the centre column shows groupings  as described to the current author; and the right-hand column shows Borsboom’s  ‘sub-clusters’ of the same song cycle. The manikay subjects relate to cosmological categories and ‘top to bottom’  ecological sectors within Marrangu Djinang country. The ‘Mewal songs’ (centre  column) and Borsboom’s ‘Gravel sub-cluster’ (right column) include subjects  associated with the driest and most inland Marrangu country, dominated by  stringybark trees, the flowers (wurrki) of which provide pollen for honeybees.  The ‘Gapi’ or Water group of songs cover subjects associated with wetland  parts of Marrangu country—fish species and wet season rains and floodwater.  My ‘ungrouped’ and Borsboom’s ‘Jungle’ sub-cluster includes entities found  in monsoonal thickets, or believed to inhabit parallel cosmological realms,  18  As Keen noted, the Liyagalawumirr clan also has a song subject named Mewal (author’s fieldnotes). 19  See Clunies Ross (1978: 129) for an overview of the manikay song genre of Arnhem Land song. 20  These name or song words are often not found in everyday discourse, and therefore not all are to be  found in dictionaries of the Djinang language (such as Waters 1983). This song word characteristic is typical of  Arnhem Land song (see Hiatt and Hiatt 1966: 2) and indeed, of song in oral traditions worldwide (see Merriam  1964: 189). 21  The 13 manikay song subjects do not represent the entire corpus of Marrangu Djinang Dreamings—there  are other significant Marrangu cosmological entities not represented in the manikay cycle. These include,  for example, Bullia (saltwater catfish), Dupun/Bardurru (hollow log), Bordjirrai (forked stick), Mulitji (fish  trap), Warbalulu or Murla (pelican), Djarrka (freshwater water goanna), Ragi (lily root) and several Cloud  Dreamings. 108 </page> <page sequence="9"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land in the mid-zone of Marrangu land. In these dense forest areas, such as at  Djambi and Bumbaldjarri, freshwater creeks meet swampy, seasonally flooding  lowlands.22 However, the four ‘ungrouped’ manikay (Table 5.1, centre column)  are not structured by any single cosmological or ecological characteristic but  are transitional motifs, and thus positioned in the song cycle between ‘Mewal’  and ‘Gapi’ songs. The cycle abides to the ‘most typical’ associations (Borsboom  1978b: 74), with the less typical linkages as the transitional motifs. Marrangu  people recognise the unity of the cycle overall. This is evidenced in statements  that all manikay are ‘Our Dream’, reflecting an understanding that the complex  interrelationships between the manikay songs bind the cycle together.

Rather than visual appeal, it is the sacred character of a place  that, in Yolngu thought, makes a place significant and memorable. In the case of Djambi and Bumbaldjarri,  they are highly significant in Marrangu Djinang belief because of their centrality in manikay and Djareware  mythology, despite being mosquito-infested, swampy and largely impenetrable. 109 </page> <page sequence="10"> Strings of Connectedness The ‘Mewal songs’ and ‘Gapi songs’ manikay groupings reference two important  mythic narratives in Marrangu cosmology: Mewal and Djareware Dreaming  (discussed above) and Bullia-Gapi Dreaming. The latter mythology, Bullia  (Saltwater Catfish) and Gapi (Water), references the final phase of Marrangu  Djinang mortuary rites known as Bardurru (or Dupun or Larrgan), when  crushed bones of the deceased are placed in a hollow log coffin. In Bullia-Gapi  Dreaming, seasonal floodwaters (Wunggutj Gapi) inundate the coastal plains,  filling fresh and saltwater creeks where fish species—Wudurbal (bream) and  Morgal (mud cod)—live. These fish, which in Marrangu belief symbolise wuguli  (birrimbirr) eternal spirits of the dead, are caught in mulitji (fish traps) imaged as a  pelican’s (warbululu) gullet. Mulitji and warbalulu are cosmologically associated  with the northwest horizon, the direction of monsoonal rains (Bara) and location  of Gorriba Island, spiritual home for deceased Marrangu individuals and the  Merri Spirit Being named Luma Luma. Bullia is not a named Marrangu manikay  song subject,23 but is a conception Dreaming in Marrangu belief. The Bullia- Gapi Dreaming is thus highly significant in Marrangu eschatological beliefs and  associated mortuary practices. That Mewal (and Merri) appear in different groupings in the typologies  (see Table 5.1) highlights that there are two shifting aspects to the Mewal spirit  being: Mewal is the Dreaming creator allied with Djareware; and, additionally,  a malign jungle spirit that interacts with Merri and spirits of the dead. Through  this polysemy Mewal is a symbol conveying the idea of ancestral regeneration  after death—a pivotal theme of the extended mortuary customs in north-central  Arnhem Land. In this Mewal is closely analogous with wuguli, the immortal  spirit aspect in Marrangu Djinang belief, that survives death and returns to clan  country or to a spirit realm with physical referent (Gorriba Island). While sharing a jungle landscape and some associated attributes, the Merri  spirit (in both its ‘dead body’ and jungle form), and in partial contrast with  Mewal, is a concept conveying unsettling ideas about mortality, daily human  experience and bodily well-being. For example, mishaps and bad dreams  are blamed on Merri’s diffuse, unpredictable and malignant presence in the  landscape, especially in local monsoonal jungle thickets and at night. As ‘dead  body’ spirit, Merri is held to exist somewhere between lived and Dreaming  realities. Merri is associated with bodily attachment and the decay of a corpse  immediately after death. Merri spirits are thought an anathema to the continuity  of social stability and individual life: they are believed to alter paths, foot tracks  and landforms, cause disputation, interrupt conception processes and intercept  wuguli spirits of the deceased, thus preventing ancestral reunion. Merri has  23  On one performance occasion during research, however, I was told that Bullia (or Djikada) was sung as a  separate manikay subject (Elliott 1991: 100). 110 </page> <page sequence="11"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land the further aspect of ‘dead body’ spirit and spirits of the longer-term dead  who live at Gorriba (an ‘island of the dead’ off the north-central Arnhem Land  coast). The cosmological significance of Gorriba Island with ‘dead body’ spirits  parallels the association of Djambi and Bumbaldjarri, the main two monsoonal  jungle sites within Marrangu country. Mewal, on the other hand, is not involved  in unsettling daily experience and is considered more benign, independent,  transcendent and intangible than Merri. Without overdrawing the contrast,  in Morphy’s (1990: 313) terms Mewal is closer to a Creator Being whereas Merri  more resembles an Inheritance Being.

The ‘dead body’ Merri is identified with the putrefying  corpse and the ‘homeless’ wandering spirit believed to separate from the body  at death. At death this wandering spirit is thought acutely dangerous, as it  hopelessly tries to return to the living community. This ‘dead body’ Merri spirit  is believed to be encountered in dreams of violence and disaster, and to cause  accidents, arguments and physical ailments. With the passing of time the ‘dead  body’ spirit withdraws from the living and joins other spirits of the dead at  Gorriba and in the jungle landscapes, shedding identity with the deceased  individual in the process, though not entirely—the ‘dead body’ Merri spirit  may withdraw but continues visiting places and people associated with the  deceased. A further significant quality of Merri (especially in its most ‘concretely’  malignant ‘dead body’ spirit aspect) follows from its recognised form and unique  position in Marrangu ontology. Merri is a highly effective and valued socialising  agent, orienting individuals towards sanctioned behaviours and roles from an  early age. Children soon learn to fear wandering in the dark alone because when  they do adults point and shout ‘merri’ (or ‘mokuy’) and hold aloft a buffalo  skull. Children quickly connect these actions with danger. Merri operates to  legitimate the positive value placed on community and family bonds because  emotional or mental disturbance and antisocial behaviour (e.g. eating alone,  walking alone, sulkiness, silence) is accounted for as a malign predilection  brought on by the agency of Merri. This is a culturally preferred explanation  that avoids blaming an individual. The contradictions and ambiguities in the attributions, significations and  interrelationships between Merri and Mewal demonstrate the importance of  these figures in Marrangu cosmology, ontology, geography and socialisation.  Mewal and Merri are an important but not all-inclusive component of Marrangu  Djinang thought. There are many more Dreaming beings and relationships  involving different Marrangu cosmological entities. Accounting for Ambiguity and Form in Mewal  and Merri Beliefs The Mewal and Merri spirit beings occupy different but shifting and overlapping  positions in Marrangu Djinang cosmology. There are cultural, geographical  and historical demographic reasons that account for the ambiguities in  the significations of Mewal and Merri in Marrangu thought. Mewal and  Merri interpenetrate across aspects of cosmology, landscape, the life cycle  112 </page> <page sequence="13"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land and daily experience. Mewal and Merri do not correspond, in any singular  straightforward way, with visible (or invisible) referents. Mewal and Merri are  conceptually similar symbols which may at times have an acknowledged physical  manifestation. At other times they do not. In these circumstances, discrepancies  in the significations people attribute to them are apt to arise. People do not point  to objects, in the way they can for honeybees or Stringybark trees, and say ‘that  is Merri’ or ‘that is Mewal’. Only by recognised and shared symbolic association  can, for example, a corpse or a carving be called ‘Merri’; or skeletal remains or  a painting of a human female collecting honey be called ‘Mewal’. Geography and demography partially accounts for ambiguities and localised  coalescence of cosmological beliefs. Galawdjapin and Gattji homelands, with  predominantly Marrangu Djinang and Wulaki speakers, respectively, are two  kilometres apart. The interpenetration of Marrangu Djinang and Wulaki belief  systems is evident in the case of Mewal. Wulaki cosmology recognises a Being  named Ganingalkngalk and Wulaki speakers sometimes use the Marrangu term  ‘Mewal’ to describe their Being. Like Mewal, Ganingalkngalk is both a creator  Being and a malevolent jungle entity: for example, Ganingalkngalk created  Gattji lagoon, an important Wulaki clan site; elsewhere in Wulaki cosmology  Ganingalkngalk is a jungle-living ‘meri’ with responsibility for the ‘larkan’ hollow  log coffin (see Thomson [Peterson] 1976: 103). Similarly, at Ramingining and  Milingimbi, Djinang speakers use the Gupapuyngu words mokuy coterminously  with Merri; and birrimbirr as an alternative for the Djinang term wuguli. Post-war demographic change in Arnhem Land, chiefly to mission- or government- established communities, has increased the diffusion of concepts from other  regional dialects and languages (interaction with Gupapuyngu at Milingimbi,  Kunwinjku at Maningrida, or Rembarrnga at Beswick, for example). Borsboom  cites the case of a Marrangu Djinang man who had, after years living at Bamyili  on the Beswick (70 kilometres east of Katherine) acquired the Rembarrnga  language word ‘Bolung’ which he applied, seemingly without contradiction, to  both Merri and Djareware (Borsboom 1978b: 54–5). This acculturation process— aided by demographic and linguistic factors, leading to the incorporation and  consolidation of names, categories and episodes, and extension of existing  beliefs—has a long history in northern Australia.24 In part due to the introduction of Christian mission-derived oppositional  ideas (‘body’ and ‘soul’, ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’) local cosmological concepts have  become less internally differentiated and nuanced, with certain scenarios being  truncated and consolidated with others. For example, the Merri being named  Luma Luma of Gorriba Island has its own Dreaming scenarios and associated  24  For example, Macknight (1980: 139–40) cites the introduction of Papuan burial customs in the Tiwi  Islands; and Warner describes use of Macassan designed masts in ‘Murngin’ mortuary rites (1937/1958: 433). 113 </page> <page sequence="14"> Strings of Connectedness sites and ceremonies, but respondents often claimed the Luma Luma Merri was  simply a synonym for either the ‘dead body’ Merri of the recent dead, or of the  longer-term dead. Finer correlations remain existent, but the process of historical  syncretism is leading to a less elaborately integrated and increasingly imprecise  framework of eschatological speculations. The scope of the Merri figure in  Marrangu eschatology has, superficially at least, been simplified as a result of  assimilation with Christian notions. Marrangu people see no contradiction in  the incorporation of Christian ideas within their own cosmology. In the idiom  of Aboriginal English, both sets of beliefs are viewed as ‘straight’, containing  truth and ‘the Law’. People at Galawdjapin and Gattji profess their belief in  Christianity to be a harmonious adjunct to Marrangu cosmology. There is no  sense in which Christian ideas are seen as incompatible with local cosmological  categorisations. There is evidence from elsewhere in Aboriginal Australia that the process of  systematic investigation itself has highlighted ambiguities in Indigenous beliefs  that are of little concern to believers themselves. Stanner (1963: 260), in his  investigation of Murinbata ‘pure’, ‘clan’ and ‘creature’ spirits, observed that  ‘there was no difficulty in getting the Murinbata to agree that their traditions  left much unclear, but the conflicts were evidently of little interest to them’.  He goes on, noting how systematic enquiry led to the unearthing of apparent  inconsistencies in Murinbata belief: All the mythic personages seemed clear cut in ordinary conversation but lost  outline or became shadowed by ambiguity under closer study. It seemed to  me precisely that property which allowed both their mythological and ritual  development ... Eventually I saw the wisdom of not forcing the ideas to a  precision that was not in them. (p. 265)  Clunies Ross and Hiatt, too, in the case of mythic interpretations of a ground  sculpture at a Gidjingali Larrgan (Bardurru) mortuary ceremony, found an  insistence on coherent interpretations forced ambiguities to come to light where  they ‘might never have become overt’ (1977: 139). My hosts at Galawdjapin  and Gattji fielded my enquiries, though few professed an appetite to investigate  the ambiguities of Mewal and Merri. The belief that Mewal and Merri exist, as  evidenced by transformations in Marrangu cosmology and country, manikay  and ceremony, was proof and knowledge enough. A closely related point here is  Keen’s recognition that there is a fundamental difference between objectivising  anthropological analyses of concepts, on one hand, and Yolngu ontological  commitment to the reality of, or living with, those concepts (1995: 505) on the  other. Researchers’ repeated and understandable inquiries about conceptual  meaning, based on our analytical drive to explain ambiguities and generate  valid generalisations, contain no ontological commitment actually to live with  those concepts, rich ambiguities and all. 114 </page> <page sequence="15"> 5 Conceptual Dynamism and Ambiguity in Marrangu Djinang Cosmology, North-Central Arnhem Land Conclusion Cosmological categorisations are an arena of human thought and practice  marked by indeterminacy, interpenetration of ideas and dynamic change.  This is especially so in oral traditions, but Judeo-Christian traditions exhibit  similar characteristics. Consider, for example, the historical diffusion of  alternate imaginings concerning angels, saints, devils and demons. In Arnhem  Land, cosmological beliefs do not constitute fully integrated and harmonious  encapsulations of socio-religious reality. Marrangu Djinang cosmology is not  a unified, fully integrated body of beliefs. Other Yolngu clan cosmologies  have been characterised as ‘chunks’ or ‘heaps’ of Dreaming scenarios ‘lumped  together’ (Morphy 1990: 326; see also Keen 1987: 103). The aptness of these terms  is arguable as they may suggest indiscriminate selection. It is true that Djinang  Marrangu cosmological beliefs place profound, transformative episodes alongside  seemingly inconsequential events, significant elements contrasting sharply  with those of (apparently) less weight. It is not a stabilised, all-encompassing  system admitting only singular, coherent or complete interpretations. Marrangu  Djinang manikay, for instance, is a selective extrapolation of thematically linked  and proximately grouped Dreaming entities, drawn from a larger and richer  corpus of potential mythic scenarios and emblems. Conceptual dynamism in belief systems engages change and active ambiguity as  an explanatory device. This process produces contradictory interrelationships,  not seamless integration. Conceptual ambiguity and semantic dynamism are  features of Marrangu Djinang cosmological and social categories. Mewal and  Merri overlap considerably in Marrangu Djinang cosmology, art, song, mortuary  beliefs and practices, lifecycle beliefs and, perhaps most significantly, in the  cultural landscape. The coalescence of these ideational, ceremonial, experiential  and geographic realities makes finding precise contextual denotations difficult.  This analysis bears out Ian Keen’s findings (1977, 1978, 1994, 1995) that  the creation and reproduction of Yolngu social meanings are buttressed by  conceptual indeterminacy and ambiguity, features that are integral to Arnhem  Land religion, and religious traditions more broadly.
