The death of Cassirer in 1945 made impossible the "Reply to Critics" which was a customary and very valuable feature of the previous volumes in this series. In its place the editor has included one of Cassirer 's own essays, "Spirit and Life in Contemporary Philosophy" written in 1930. Comments on most of the individual essays will be brief. Carl Hamburg discusses clearly and adequately the central concept of symbolic form. Rob- ert Hartman claims that the symbolic forms can be understood in the terms of the plastic arts as creations in space. He- draws many analogies to Rodin's sculpture and claims that the cultural crisis of our times can be over- come by comprehending these forms as symbolic of man and his world. Felix Kaufman and Dimitry Gawron- sky show that Cassirer 's Neo-Kantian philosophy of scientific knowledge is not tied to the outmoded a prioris of Kantian space and time. Neither, how- ever, discusses the full implication of the historical development of physical theory for the doctrine of a priori in- variants. L. K. Stephens flatly- rejects Cassirer 's contention that invariance is the criterion of the a priori. She presents an alternative doctrine of the a priori as* pragmatic definitions of classificatory concepts. Harold Smart alleges that Cassirer actually aban- dons Kant's conception of the a priori and reverts to a more formal analytic notion of Liebniz. William Swabey de- velops an alternative system of dualis- tic realism (which Cassirer himself fought against) and attempts a refuta- tion of the antimetaphysical idealism of Cassirer. Four essays deal with art. Thus art comes nearest to the intel- lectual goal of combining the universal arid the particular. But Cassirer neg- lects considerations of the social and psychological conditions of art in his- tory. Konstantin Reichardt examines Cassirer 's study of Holderin and Kleist. He thinks Cassirer 's main con- cern is the investigation of the rela- tion of between the reflective - and imaginative world of the artist. As a critic he seeks the poetic essence, the full essence of the artist's creative and creative world. There is no symbolic form for ethics in Cassirer 's philoso- phy. Despite great sympathy and un- derstanding for Cassirer 's thought Wibur Urban nevertheless objects to Cassirer 's treatment of religion and his neglect of metaphysical language. There are a number of essays which explore more particularly Cassirer 's conception of Geisteswissenschaften, and thus are of more immediate inter- est to readers of this journal. They place the emphasis variously upon the humanistic, symbolic, or historical aspects of Cassirer 's philosophy. James Gutmann and David Bidney are content to place Cassirer 's concep- tion of the Geisteswissenschaften within a humanistic and philosophical, anthropological setting. Gutmann finds, in a study of Cassirer 's human- ism, that it is not a mere segment of his philosophy but constitutes rather a pervasive attitude permeating all his writings. Cassirer 's Essay on Man is a concrete testament to his belief that man as a functional being is the center of creative and symbolic ac- tivity, where all his works, objectified in various symbolic forms, have a com- mon referment and center in man him- self. The anthropomorphic element in such a field as history, therefore, can- not be erased but is necessary in order that the mind may re-enact and re-ex- perience historical events. Self-knowl- edge thus is not a deterrent but the very basis for the study of the social world. John H. Randall and Walter Sol- lnitz contribute two significant articles</page><page sequence="3">BOOK BEVIEWS 189 on Cassirer 's conception of history. Randall is concerned with three things; Cassirer 's conception of his- tory, his application of it to the Ren- aissance, and finally, the limitations of Cassirer 's approach to history. On the first score Randall points out that Cas- sirer has no broad view of the social sciences. He scarcely speaks of social sciences like economics, geography and sociology but restricts himself to history. The data of the historian con- sists of symbols that are meaningful, and hence must be understood and in- terpreted. The historian seeks a re- birth of the past; in doing so he be- comes a retrospective prophet. In his procedures the historian is doomed to be bound by the same rules as the sci- entist. He must adhere to the strict rules of empirical investigation, and yet Cassirer believes that in the recon- struction of the past, the historian finally engages in an act of the produc- tive imagination. Thus in interpreting the life of an historical personality, besides gathering all available evi- dence, the historian must try to see this evidence as symbolic of the total char- acter of the man. The historian must therefore endeavor to find the inner center or core of the man, which will illuminate every aspect of his person- ality. An age is therefore seen by Cas- sirer in terms of a symbolic recon- struction on the basis of great men. Symbolic reconstruction of the struc- ture of a personality or an age rather than causal analysis is Cassirer 's way of looking at the past. Randall brilliantly applies this analysis of Cassirer 's conception of history to his treatment of the Renais- sance. He shows why Cassirer was not concerned with a causal and genetic interpretation of the Renaissance, e.g., the origin of the Renaissance, but rather with a symbolic reconstruction of it in terms of leading personalities, each of whom stood as an intellectual symbol of its leading motifs. However, Randall discerns an ambiguity in Cas- sirer 's treatment of personalities and ages. Sometimes Cassirer thinks in terms of structural patterns that are morphological and descriptive. Then again he talks in terms of new tasks, goals and ends which imply a func- tional orientation. The book has two major drawbacks. On the descriptive side it is needlessly repetitious. Many contributors mull over the same material, and yet to- gether they present no adequate de- sign of the total system of Cassirer. On the critical side the book is fuzzy. It contains no sharp analyses of the dialectic and no clear cut refutations of the cardinal doctrines of idealism. In place of arguments there are very often "objections" and confrontation of alternative views. The book tells as much about contemporary philosophy as it does about Cassirer. - Raymond Hoekstra, Wayne Univebsity and Milton Covensky, Wayne University.</page></plain_text>
