<plain_text><page sequence="1">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth Kevin McGuirk By the time he was writing his book-length Sphere: The Form of a Motion in 1972, A. R. Ammons, the declared "periphery rif- fler" (Selected Poems 71), had created "a major canon." He was, Har- old Bloom claimed the previous year, "a descendant of the great originals of American Romantic tradition" (Ringers 257) and "the central poet of my generation" (261). His Collected Poems 1951-1971 was to win the National Book Award, and Sphere would win the Bollingen Prize in Poetry for 1973-74. Finally, the academic jour- nal Diacritics assembled a special issue on his work, edited by Bloom and published in early 1974 with excerpts from Sphere, con- firming his intellectual import among the most advanced critical circles. As Cary Wolfe notes, the essays collected in Diacritics were typ- ical of Ammons criticism in their "Emersonian bias" (78), ignoring his revision of romantic poetics and demonstrating his significance in narrowly literary terms, with the lyrics standing in for the work as a whole. Wolfe turns to cybernetics and to the long poems to support his counter-reading of Ammons, emphasizing the centrif- ugal rather than centripetal tendencies of his work, and the ideo- ? 1997 by Cultural Critique. Fall 1997. 0882-4371/97/$5.00. 131</page><page sequence="2">132 Kevin McGuirk logical over the literary. While he elaborates Ammons's "highly am- bivalent" (78) response to the romantics, specifically to "the closure of organic form as traditionally conceived" and "its analogue of symbol and lyric" (83), Wolfe ultimately stops short of breaking the literary-Emersonian framework. With his emphasis on poetics- "how a given poet constitutes his subject" (78)-he occludes the ways in which other forces constitute both the poet's subject and the poet himself. Ammons's self-professedly antihistorical poetry- "history is a blank"1-Wolfe concludes, is now historical, and, as he brilliantly shows, it needs to be read in relation to new episte- mologies like cybernetics, though these must be considered as ide- ologies of postwar United States.2 His work should also be situated within the dramatic political events taking place at Cornell Univer- sity (where Ammons began teaching in 1964) and in the United States during the late 1960s, as well as within the more abstract and intimate contexts of postwar American globalism and corpo- ratism; and it should be read finally as the product-in part-of the poet's psychocultural biography. If Archie Ammons, the poor southern farm boy who never left his home county-except once for a picnic-until the age of seventeen (Haythe 177), was surprised and discomfited by his ce- lebrity in these years, perhaps this reaction accounts for the evi- dent embarrassment he feels in making the large gestures of Sphere. The rather self-regarding prophetic mode of the latter pages provokes the self-deprecations-"you may / think I've finally got the grandeurs" (66)-of an essentially private man, suddenly possessed of substantial literary capital, trying to realize at once the vast scope of his themes and the greatness scripted for him both by his champions and his powerful national identification. His most ambitious poem ("my magnum hokum" [77]), Sphere takes on nothing less than the fate of the planet gliding through the universe. I will argue that Ammons's central question-"how can the bluegreen earth look / purposeful, turn a noticeable mar- gin to meaning" (30)-locates this poem as a historical project circa 1972 in the United States of America by establishing as backdrop and informing image that once resplendent, now ubiquitous, commod- ified, and banal NASA photograph of the whole earth seen from space in 1967-a cultural isomorph of Buckminster Fuller's spheri- cal U.S. pavilion, the virtual symbol of Expo 67, one of the last great spectacles of technological utopianism.3</page><page sequence="3">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth In its circularity and indeterminate ("bluegreen") content, this earth image is a perfect cipher. An empty 0, it is susceptible to readings that project onto it a fullness of determinate meaning. Many have suggested that the image is epochal, as if a timeless truth about the earth and its inhabitants entered history in 1967, changing everything; yet, its meanings can be shown to be contex- tual, historical, and contradictory, rather than immanent and self- identical. It is, to begin with, too literally a "world picture" to have any intrinsic meaning.4 What I intend to examine in this article is some of the ideological work performed by the image in the cul- tural moment "1972" as it bears on the ways in which we know our world. Ammons is of particular relevance here because he is primarily and obsessively a writer for whom poetry is a special kind of epistemology, related symbolically to other epistemological schemes and exemplary for that reason. The wide-ranging, dia- ristic, and apparently unplotted speculations of the first half of Sphere finally engender a plot structured around two interrelated and emerging problematics. First, Sphere dramatizes an encounter between its own post-romantic, open, and participatory poetics, and an arresting example of what Frank Kermode called a "ro- mantic image" in his classic work of that title-that is, the whole earth image.5 Second, it tropes between a cultural moment charac- terized by American aspiration and gigantism, embodied in the U.S. space program, and the moment and aspirations of A. R. Am- mons-between the "grandeurs" of the United States on the world stage and the "grandeurs" of the poet. If the whole earth image remains for some a "stunning trans- nationalist vision" (Sagan, Pale Blue Dot 218), I will argue that it is not just a transcendent or objective view of the "home planet" given to humanity "by progress," or merely a literally spectacular occasion for Ammons's meditation on the meaning of our sphere in 1972. In that year, the whole earth image is a "world picture" that performs American ideological work, and Ammons's Sphere partici- pates in this project. My first section elaborates chief American ide- ologies, namely romanticism and frontier ideologies, which have elucidated the conquest of both what is now the United States and outer space, examining how these have obscured the difference between American space and outer space as grounds for con- structing what are necessarily cultural meanings. My second sec- tion elucidates the problematics of received readings of the whole 133</page><page sequence="4">134 Kevin McGuirk earth image, a text called on to embody certain contemporary forms of knowledge. My last section turns to Sphere and proposes the more directly political work of the photo as an American icon in Ammons's poem and in the culture at large. I In an earlier version of this article, I took my title from one of a profusion of quasi-educational introductions to space science and exploration that appeared in the first decades after Sputnik's "historic" launch above the atmosphere: Davies and Murray's The View from Space: Photographic Exploration of the Planets, published in 1971. The first words of the authors' preface reiterate a notion of a relationship with nature that is essentially literary and romantic: "Space is intrinsically remote and impersonal," they write; "Yet the interaction of the human mind and spirit with space can be in- tensely personal and intimate and truly constitutes a unique aspect of twentieth-century experience" (ix). Emerson is, of course, the central figure in American romanticism, and his prescient and vivid consciousness of something like a view from space must qual- ify those authors' words.6 Emerson's work also touches on an alter- nate relationship to nature, which stands uncomfortably beside the romantic one: the relationship inscribed within the American idea of the frontier. Is space a frontier, waiting for the heroics of Ameri- can explorers and for development and colonization? Or is it part of the romantic nature "whose floods of life," in Emerson's words, "stream around and through us," with which the human mind and spirit can interact? Emerson notes that such floods "invite us, by the power they supply, to action proportioned to nature" ("Nature" 3), therein suggesting the reciprocity in American culture between romantic ideology and frontier ideology, as well as Emerson's com- plex investment in both. The aptness of these ideologies to space exploration as to the Euroamerican conquest of the continent is crudely just but for one difference: the presence of others in America, the absence of others in space.7 Turner's "frontier hypothesis" (1893) consolidated a notion of American identity building over a century of encounter between a civilization and an "empty" wilderness. He proposed that "[t]he</page><page sequence="5">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 135 existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American de- velopment" (59). At a later moment, Henry Nash Smith would ob- serve that "one of the most persistent generalizations concerning American life and character is the notion that our society has been shaped by the pull of a vacant continent drawing population west- ward" (3). Turner's hypothesis, then, "concerns the image of them- selves which many-perhaps most-Americans of the present day cherish, an image that defines what Americans think of the past, and therefore what they propose to make of themselves in the fu- ture" (3). This was in 1950, in the early years of what Dale Carter has called the Rocket State. Ten years later, it would be such a generalized notion of American character that would inspire John F. Kennedy's invocation of a "New Frontier" and his commitment to "a great new American enterprise": in short, "to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth" (qtd. in Michael Smith 198). Not surprisingly, frontier rhetoric would dominate government and media discourse on space travel for the next decade.8 If movement across the continent during the nineteenth cen- tury accrued power for the growing nation, Emerson would be its chief literary expositor-"the American theoretician of power," ac- cording to Bloom (Poetics 312)-expounding a supplement to the nascent power of his country. Emerson sought specifically to Amer- icanize romanticism, as David Reynolds argues, by grafting onto it and disposing in language the raw power of the literal encounter with frontier nature. "The linguistic invasion from the frontier" into the U.S. northeast in the 1830s, particularly the outlandish troping that characterized "tall tales," offered a model for the revi- sion of standard romanticism (Reynolds 487). Thus we find, in two well-known examples, Emerson's image of Shakespeare whose "im- perial muse tosses the creation like a bauble from hand to hand" and the grotesque picture of himself as "transparent eyeball" expe- riencing "the currents of the Universal Being" ("Nature" 29, 6). Where much romantic work from Wordsworth to Seamus Heaney has been structured by a dialectic of pathos and power,9 Emerson affirmed, with the help of such aggressive figuration, an American vision of unqualified power. Jerome McGann's formulation of the romantic ideology might</page><page sequence="6">136 Kevin McGuirk sound a cautionary note here. McGann proposes that "[t]he poetry of Romanticism is everywhere marked by extreme forms of dis- placement and conceptualization whereby the actual human issues with which the poetry is concerned are resituated in a variety of idealized localities," chief of which is nature (1). This characteristic act of displacement is ambiguous. Is it an act of power such as Emerson would attribute to the poet, who "converts the solid globe, the land, the sea, the sun, the animals into symbols of thought" (Early Lectures 224)? Or is it an evasion on the part of the literally powerless, a witness to the pathos of social irrelevance and alienation in the natural world? As Eric Cheyfitz argues, Emerson's attitude toward American power is, in fact, primarily a defensive one. When he "attributes to Shakespeare ... the same omnipo- tence that Shakespeare attributes to Prospero," it is to project "an imperial figure who acts absolutely" (28) but does so by deploying the chief technology of Renaissance culture: eloquence. Prospero's very words have the power to direct nature; thus, he stands as Em- erson's prop against an emerging industrial power that would have nature be responsive only to the literal force of the machine. Emerson, then, is finally a romantic writer despite his flirta- tion with the modes of action shaping his nation: he may have "ap- propriated America" (Bloom, Poetics 317) but only to claim its power for imagination. He is accordingly careful to distinguish his "poetical sense" of nature-"the integrity of impression made by manifold objects"-from the use-value the frontiersman saw: "It is this which distinguishes the stick of timber of the woodcutter from the tree of the poet" ("Nature" 5). Yet his primary commitment to the imagination should not obscure the structure of displacement which romantic ideology of nature shares with frontier ideology. Frontiersmen, according to the latter, are displaced to a new and idealized locale that is not merely reconceptualized but rather lit- erally reshaped by the mastering, taming, and conquering enacted by the "imagination" of the settler or explorer. That is, the advance of the American frontier and the growth of its ideology are predi- cated on the suppression of the presence of indigenous peoples on the land-by both ideological and literal force. Similarly, if roman- tic power is most available in solitude, which is most available in nature (as Emerson would argue), that power is predicated on the absence of others-of society-in the romantic locale. Both ideolo-</page><page sequence="7">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 137 gies depend on displacement-figurative and perceptual for the poet; literal for the frontiersman-to "places" that afford a greater range of perception and movement: an aversion of the eyes from specifically human, social concerns. Unpeopled space would seem a place where such an aversion would be unnecessary: what Emerson called the conspiracy of so- ciety against the individual need not trouble our meeting with nature, nor will the presence of other peoples interfere with devel- opment and colonization. It seems to offer a "ground" for the apo- theosis of both ideologies: American power and American imagina- tion will be finally and truly unqualified in space. Yet the structural difference-no Other is part of the ideological equation-makes such an apotheosis facile at best, and meaningless at worst. What emerges from space exploration, ignored by its ideologues, is oth- erness of a peculiar sort. I want to quote here two suggestive com- ments on the human presence in space. In The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other (1982), Tzvetan Todorov alludes to space travel once: The moon is farther away than America from Europe . .. but today we know that our encounter with it is no encounter at all, and that this discovery does not occasion surprises of the same kinds [as did the discovery of America]: for a living being to be photographed on the moon, an astronaut must stand in front of the camera, and in his helmet we see only one reflec- tion, that of another earthling. (4) Relatedly, Hannah Arendt, writing in 1963, reflects on the arrival of human beings in outer space: The astronaut, shot into outer space and imprisoned in his instrument-ridden capsule where each actual physical encoun- ter with his surroundings would spell immediate death, might well be taken as the symbolic incarnation of Heisenberg's man-the man who will be the less likely ever to meet any- thing but himself and man-made things the more ardently he wishes to eliminate all anthropomorphic considerations from his encounters with the non-human world around him. (277)10 The position of Einstein's "observer poised in free space," or that of the astronaut-frontiersman, affords initial power but ends in pa-</page><page sequence="8">138 Kevin McGuirk thos. Picture a cartoon character, wielding Archimedes's lever, who suddenly looks down to discover he is standing on something less than air. There is no "ground" for producing ideology in space. Recent historical and literary scholarship, summarized in a key article by Annette Kolodny, has done far-reaching work in re- conceptualizing the frontier: it is the moment of meeting and inter- penetration between two cultures in a specific, and changing, envi- ronment. (Todorov, for example, reads the conquest of Mexico as the encounter between alien cultures on the ground of one of them, not the encounter of civilization and wilderness.) According to Star Trek, a TV program launched in the heyday of space explo- ration, space is "the final frontier"; but that show is a fiction that projects into the void a Kolodnian frontier, a multicultural uni- verse travelled by gentler, wiser explorers than those who con- quered America, and whose "Prime Directive" is based on respect for cultural difference. Real space travel encounters cultural void. As there is no other there-only emblems of ourselves-we our- selves become the other we strangely meet. Thus, while space may afford (vicariously, since it is not available to us like Emerson's woodlot) as much intransitive awe as anything on this planet, and while it may afford occasions for asserting power and demonstra- ting know-how, Todorov and Arendt collectively identify an inexo- rable pathos as the keynote of the space enterprise because it fails to provide genuine knowledge of otherness. II The major emblem of ourselves discovered in space is not a picture of a living being, but it has been read as a compelling image of the human condition nonetheless. Late in Sphere, Ammons de- scribes the earth viewed from space, which, he notes in a later in- terview, "we were beginning to see... on the television screen, at a time when it was inevitable to think about that as the central image of our lives-that sphere" (Walsh 112): from other planets, as with other planets from here, we rise and set, our presence reduced to light, noticeable in the dark when the sun is</page><page sequence="9">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 139 away: reduced and distanced into light, our brotherhood constituted into shining, our landforms, seas, colors subsumed to bright announcements: we are alone in a sea that shows itself nowhere in a falling surf but if it does not go on forever folds back into a further motion of itself: the plenitude of nothingness! (77) Ammons's poetic is derived in part from Emerson's exuberant rela- tivism, and like Emerson, he has "prized multeity / and difference down to the mold under the leaf// on the one hand and swept up into the perfect composures of nothingness on the other" (65). But if such encompassing gestures are merely shadows of those made by Emerson, Ammons's text is notably troubled by the implications of the view of earth from space when Emerson's is not. Neither Ammons-nor any contemporary-is likely to sustain such faith in the imaginative power proclaimed in Emerson's account of the poet's work. We now know too well that we are subject to forces that threaten to convert the solid globe and everything on it, in- cluding the poet's imagination, into nonexistence. Emerson claims that "the one lesson which this miraculous world has to teach us ... [is] to be sacred, to stand aloof, and suffer no man and no custom, no mode of thinking to intrude upon us and bereave us of our infinitude" (1839). But the view from space, if nothing else, speaks of our finitude, our own otherness in a universe void of self. Earth becomes an object of pathos, no longer an inexhaustible source, and its inhabitants orphans in the void. I would argue fur- ther that the whole earth image is as much the symbolization of our destructive power and the culmination of our will to know the globe, as it is an image of an ideal integrity. Colonial expansion and scientific experiment, the chief practice of Western epistemol- ogy, are deeply implicated in the destruction of both indigenous cultures and natural habitats. Our ability to view the earth as a whole coincides with our capability to destroy it, historically as well as symbolically. Yet, the whole earth image continues to be read as self- evidently a benign source of knowledge that might contribute both to world peace and to "saving the earth," despite its symbolic rela- tion to the history of Western knowledge and colonialism, its mate-</page><page sequence="10">140 Kevin McGuirk rial connection to the massive technological apparatuses of a post- war imperial power, and its ambiguities as an interpretable text. Even before NASA took a photograph of the whole earth from "outside," it was invoked to support what have since become stan- dard readings (which I take as confirmation of my earlier claim that the image is chiefly a cipher, a mirror of ideology). In 1950, in the early days of the United Nations, the physicist Fred Hoyle speculated that "[o]nce a photograph of the Earth, taken from out- side, is available, we shall, in an emotional sense, acquire an addi- tional dimension.... Once let the sheer isolation of the Earth be- come plain to every man whatever his nationality or creed, and a new idea as powerful as any in history will be let loose." The view of earth, he added hopefully, "must increasingly have the effect of exposing the futility of nationalistic strife" (9). In 1965, at the beginnings of the ecological movement, Stewart Brand, later edi- tor of The Whole Earth Catalogue (1971), placed himself in public spaces near various American institutions (Columbia University, MIT, Harvard Square, NASA headquarters), "sell[ing] to all com- mers, at cost, plastic badges that asked in large black letters on a white background: 'WHY HAVE WE NOT YET SEEN A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE EARTH?'" (Morrison 142). Brand intuited that the real pho- tograph might score a point for ecology. His Whole Earth Catalogue advanced an argument and techniques for a localist, small-scale environmentalism sensitive to the earth as a single interconnected ecosystem represented literally and symbolically by the whole earth image on its front cover. Since the actual photo was produced, our readings have not progressed much. Consider the widely disseminated and I think representative musings of Carl Sagan, a professor of astronomy and scientistic thinker, who served for twenty years as a kind of public relations man for the space age through his successful TV series Cosmos and many best-selling books. "I'm struck again," he writes in 1994, "by the irony that spaceflight-conceived in the cauldron of nationalist rivalries and hatreds-brings with it a stun- ning transnationalist vision. You spend a little time contemplating the earth from orbit and the most deeply ingrained nationalisms begin to erode. They seem like the squabbles of mites on a plum" (Pale Blue Dot 218-19). For Sagan, space science and travel are im- portant for a number of reasons. Unlike Brand, who advocates lo-</page><page sequence="11">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 141 calist practice, Sagan sees in work on the earth as a whole a critical solution to ecological problems. Thus, he argues that we must ex- plore space because "when we explore other worlds, what seemed the only way a planet could be turns out to be somewhere in the middle range of a vast spectrum of possibilities": "comparative planetology" will provide knowledge of our earth and how to man- age it (219). In more naively ideological, rather than pragmatic, terms, Sagan suggests that space exerts a mystical pull on human- ity: it is "resonant with our nature"; "some part of our being knows this is from where we came" (Cosmos 347, 20). "The surface of the earth is the shore of a cosmic ocean" (Cosmos 20), where we stand just as Europeans stood on the shores of the Atlantic at the dawn- ing of the age of exploration. In Sagan's scientistic view, the ad- vance of scientific knowledge through experiment and exploration is the motive of what we call "civilization," the apparently unitary culture of the West. To ignore the imperative issuing from the void is to risk cultural stagnation. It is worth comparing this scientism with the view represented by Kolodny. Sagan's reduction of struggles for identity and power to the squabble of mites banishes history to the margins; he offers in its place the fantasy of world peace following from the contem- plation of the earth viewed from space."1 In Kolodny's reading, Western and specifically American "civilization" has developed culturally: we in North America became who we are primarily through encounters with other cultures as well as with the land. In this view, culture is always plural, partial, and in process. Com- parative anthropology as well as recent postcolonial theory in- structs us in the specific character of our own culture through com- parison with other cultures-ours is no longer normative, nor for that matter internally coherent and reducible to one-but compar- ative planetology is of significance mainly to resource managers who parcel up the earth as so much raw material. Sagan may be quite sincere in his political and ecological advocacy, but his scien- tism supports a narrative of globalism that reduces the earth to a source of new markets and the object of technology, a narrative whose final chapter might well exploit the symbolic resonances of Sagan's bizarre book title: earth as a "pale blue dot," photographed mechanically from NASA spacecraft near Neptune. If the standard readings of Hoyle and Sagan seem obviously</page><page sequence="12">142 Kevin McGuirk ideological, what is less obvious is the way in which a utopian and scientistic vision complements an aesthetic habit of perception, the tendency of which is to abstract the object from social contexts that compromise the ritual purity of its "meaning." I will make this point clearer in the next paragraphs. Philip Morrison, another prominent physicist, has remarked that the whole earth photograph represents a remarkable reifica- tion of scientific measuring of the earth.12 Such an extreme reifica- tion may be "stunning" (Sagan) or "good" (Morrison), but it can admit only an extremely abstract meaning. In Hoyle's standard version: "we are all one," a statement true only at an extremely high level of abstraction (or great profundity, if you wish). The im- age might be said finally to evoke what can be only a rather ab- stract sympathy with a beleaguered planet, one which cannot eas- ily be transposed to a different register: to praxis, which is always local, specific, and proceeds on the basis of partial knowledge. Sa- gan and Hoyle, for their part, offer a form of thought, the ritual observance of an icon: reiterations of an Enlightenment narrative about humanity's rational advance to political unity and unified knowledge. Emerson's figure of the "transparent eyeball" is justly famous because it summarizes his central, and romantic, project: to over- come the division of subject and object by making epistemology and ontology speak one "truth." It promises to take visual percep- tion, intrinsically an alienated activity and the trope of Western knowledge, and fleshes it with being. Or it works the other way, unfleshing being to make pure perception: "I am nothing; I see all." Similarly, the whole earth image promises epistemological cer- tainty in unified vision and ontological fullness for our world. But what could be more precarious, more uncertain-what could be more alienated, more vacant-than the position of a freely floating eye above earth's atmosphere, poised before the vertiginous fall from one Archimedean point of leverage or mastery to another, further and further into void, to the point where earth appears as pale blue dot, and then vanishes? In Emerson, epistemological certainty and ontological fullness are incommensurables yoked to- gether by an aggressive style. The whole earth image evades the need of such force by displacing this unity from the experiencing subject and projecting it onto the object, while banishing the eye</page><page sequence="13">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth from the environment of its object. The eye is the only sense organ that can function freely in space, perhaps even improving the illu- sion of perceptual freedom and transparency that it normally pro- motes anyway. The whole earth image represents ontological full- ness, but it embodies the absolute alienation of the technologized human observer. If romantic poetics sought to overcome the division of subject and object created by Enlightenment thought, it would do so by aesthetic rather than strictly epistemological means, aiming to dis- cover a compensatory harmony separate from the dissonances of everyday practice. A primary aesthetic strategy, for instance, would displace history to the margins, permitting the object the totality and autonomy on which aesthetic beauty is predicated: for an aes- thetic object is ideally nondialectical, an identity resistant to the alterity that constitutes it. The whole earth image functions in just this way, as an example of what Frank Kermode calls a "romantic image." Kermode begins his discussion by invoking an account of the image strikingly reminiscent of descriptions of the earth seen from space. "The main topic," he begins, is that "esthetic image" explained in Thomist language by Ste- phen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: it is for him that beauty which has the three attributes of integrity, consonance and clarity; which is "apprehended as one thing ... self-bounded and self-contained upon the immeasurable background of space and time which is not it"; apprehended in its quidditas by the artist whose mind is arrested in "a lumi- nous stasis of esthetic pleasure." (1) Such an image is nondiscursive; its meaning is coextensive with its substance, an identity of object and meaning that affords that "integrity of impression" Emerson termed "poetic." Early theorists of the aesthetic argued that the ideal poem is like the world de- scribed by rationalist philosophers-in Karsten Harries's words, "a perfectly ordered whole having its sufficient reason in God"; "just as the world has its sufficient reason in God, the poem has the sufficient reason in the theme" (75). The earth we see in the whole earth image, then, is a kind of earth-poem having its sufficient rea- son not in God but in a theme ("we are all one") rising irresistably from its substance. In place of the terror of the void, the whole 143</page><page sequence="14">144 Kevin McGuirk earth image offers, to paraphrase Lyotard, the solace of a good theme, the formalism of thought that New Critics substituted for genuine cognition. Indeed, like the New Critics, who privileged immanent meaning, banishing the author and reader from the range of the interpreter-therefore requiring a theme to guaran- tee the poem-we tend to grant the whole earth image the special status of an icon that is immanent, rather than articulate, with meaning. It is articulate, however, with narrative meanings inher- ited from the Enlightenment, and the image provides an appro- priate symbolic closure for the Englightenment narrative insofar as it displays transparently the conclusion to its plot and represses its contradictions. It is the earth re-enchanted, not by animism, but by an unself-conscious and totalizing knowledge.13 III In his skepticism toward metanarratives, totalizations that give no purchase on the particulars of the world, Ammons invites the label "postmodern." He is insistently dialectical in his proce- dures, writing an ongoing poetry of inquiry and observation, mov- ing restlessly from notation to speculation. Motion is a key concept in his work, taking in values like fluidity, mobility, process, and al- terity. Ammons works along the metonymic, horizontal axis of meaning, in which the relations that constitute meaning occur among elements in shifting and accidental contexts. In contrast, relations along the vertical pole of metaphor are total and a- contextual, composing what Ammons calls "a too / adequate rela- tionship" (Selected Poems 81). Cary Wolfe accordingly identifies Am- mons's work with the "metonymic symbol," which defines a project "to consciously resituate poetry-and, by extension, culture-in a network of relations both biological and social" (90) rather than in the transcendent relations between elements of a metaphor.14 But Ammons has also explained that his "whole theory of po- etics has been ... to work out some centralizing means that will not lose contact with the least particular, democratically speaking- the coincidental, the single person in the farthest reach" (Haythe 181-82). So if his poetics discovers in phenomena a built-in "recal- citrance" (a favorite Ammons word) to paradigm, promoting open-</page><page sequence="15">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 145 ended forms and privileging partial knowledge, its alternate proj- ect "of working out some centralizing means"-by way of narra- tives of progress, narratives of intensifying identity and mastery over disorder-is given the widest scope and encouragement in Sphere. Indeed, the presence of the transcendent whole earth im- age and of consistent references to space travel, both of which are inscribed with a repertoire of ready-made narratives, promotes in Sphere a full elaboration of Ammons's centralizing project. The PR people of the space age, at NASA and in the media, have relied on a few familiar tales to explain their client as if by analogical proof: space is a frontier; space exploration is territorial conquest continuous with the exploration and conquest of the New World; it is leaving the womb of earth or the coming of age of man; space travel marks the latest, and triumphant, phase in evolution, a grand metanarrative of which Humanity is the hero. For ex- ample, on the day the Eagle landed on the moon in 1969, the Washington Post proclaimed that "[t]he creature who had once stood blinking at the door of his Paleolithic cave has come a long way.... At long last, man is on the brink of mastering the universe" (qtd. in Michael Smith 209). Ammons is more tonally complex when he recapitulates this particular narrative; for him, there is pathos as well as power in mastery, but finally, as we will see, the catastrophe of knowledge envisioned here becomes in the larger plot of Sphere an occasion for asserting some compensatory imaginative power. "[M]an waited," he begins, 75,000 years in a single cave (cold, hunger, inexplicable visitation of disease) only to rise to the bright, complex knowledge of his destruction! that heaviness weighs down, lacking an interpenetrating spiritual float: but were men, starting out three million years ago, calling up to us: if they were not able to call up to us, what in them was able to call them up: what was the hidden, interior elixir that glided them along the ground, gave them the speech of staring into their dumbfounded hands: or did they turn in each day's light, storming the world for food and place, merely and sufficiently: when we have made the sufficient mirror will</page><page sequence="16">146 Kevin McGuirk it have been only to show how things will break: know thyself and vanish! (30-31) What Ammons allows here is that "progress" may be mere plunder for sufficiency or survival. In epistemological terms, the apotheosis of progress in the closed circle of identity (know thyself) is a cue for self-cancellation. Thus, the whole earth image as "sufficient mirror"-a reification of all we otherwise know, and the summoning of earth before our imperial subjectivity-may simply display the goods of knowledge or trade before they are plundered absolutely. As my outline above may suggest, Ammons's epistemological practice would seem to find a neat fit with the postmodern knowl- edge described by Lyotard as the exemplary practice of a transhis- torical avant-garde. Discovering the "incommensurability of reality to concept," the postmodern artist/thinker embraces "the increase of being and the jubilation which result from the invention of new rules of the game" (79). Knowledge in these terms always means a ratio of knowing and not-knowing, which makes true inquiry a process that provides, in Ammons's phrase, a "growing edge to change and surprise" (Sphere 42). The totalization of knowledge represented by the whole earth image achieves a sublimity that de- stroys the occasion of its possibility, because sublimity is constituted in edginess between subject and sublime object-or, for Lyotard, in the incommensurability of the subject's representations and its objects.15 This image poses a problem for a postmodern poetics that functions along a metonymic axis because it purports to repre- sent successfully and metaphorically what has hitherto been un- representable. Now, if Ammons's practice is in Lyotard's sense char- acteristically postmodern-"Overall," he declares in his best- known poem, "Corsons Inlet," "is beyond me" (Selected Poems 44)- the whole earth image, as a metaphorical representation of "Over- all," puts a certain pressure on that practice as Sphere proceeds. The poem works as follows. As a lengthy text responding to the accidents of the poet's days-the weather, a family gathering, casual notations of dates-Sphere is constantly refreshed and re- constituted by sources external to the poem. This reflects a prin- ciple of composition-the process is evident throughout the prod- uct-as well as a conviction about the poem's relation to reality. The poem, then, is an example of the kinds of "open form" cele-</page><page sequence="17">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 147 brated in the 1960s: resistant to closure, committed to process rather than product; participatory rather than controlling: a cy- bernetic open system rather than the closed system of mechanistic science. It is not conventionally organic in form because its arbi- trary format-155 numbered sections of four tercets each-at once casts the poem out of the poet's subjectivity into a more dia- logic mode and reveals the "organism" as constructed of alterity, of the various contiguous elements of its temporal and spatial envi- ronment interacting with its "genetically" given characteristics. Modular in construction, the poem has no internal principle re- quiring closure and indeed, like many postmodern long poems, flirts with the entropic tendency in discourse toward banality, or noise. This tendency is countered, however, by a thematizing mecha- nism which "processes" some details, and not others, by turning them into representative details, synecdoches that open out to gen- erality from part or particular to a whole. Metonymic details en- countered in the poem's forward movement along a horizontal axis become synecdochic metaphors signifying upward along a vertical chain. And synecdoche, in Alan Liu's phrasing, "redeems" meton- ymy (86). Sphere's structure is, then, more obviously motivated than that of preceding long poems like "Essay on Poetics," where Am- mons privileged "strings of nucleations" over "representative de- tails" (46). As this mechanism increasingly comes into play, its transfor- mations produce a plot: a topic, a setting, a sustained thematics, and a primary, resonating symbol. Emerson would say that the dates Ammons notes are "accidental" to the poem because they are not natural, which is to say that they are markers of social rather than natural identity. But these are important precisely because they locate the poem in a social, not a transcendent, realm; that is, from April 1972 until around June (or two-thirds of the way through the poem), after which notations of dates cease, the poem partakes and makes within a world where "to be saved is here, local and mortal" (25). Apollo 16 blasts off (28) early on, but in the changing mode of the poem, this incidental notation will prove to have been the seed of a thematics that determines its final course. The poet rises from the humble backyard and typing table to the platform of earth's orbit, from diaristic notation to prophecy, from</page><page sequence="18">148 Kevin McGuirk "[t]he sexual basis of all things" (10) to the motion of "spaceship earth" through the universe. Taken as a whole, then, and despite its multifarious surface content, Sphere is governed by a meta- narrative embodied in the American drive to space. Ammons is too much an American optimist to allow a reading of the whole earth image as an image of catastrophe to stand for long. In fact, his poem shortly resumes the narrative of American exceptionalism according to which the United States, still, in 1972, leads us into a bright future. In the terms I outlined above, his country is not some metonymic detail in the international mosaic but the exemplary part, a synecdoche for the whole. This is consis- tent with an American rhetoric synecdochizing the United States, which sees the cause of America, as Thomas Paine put it, as the cause of all mankind. A well-known recent example is the claim that a certain small step by an (American) man is a giant leap for mankind. Such rhetoric produces a tactical confusion between American interests and general human interests. V. G. Kiernan notes of the Cold War period in particular (which in this respect is not over) that "America loved to think that whatever it wanted was just what the human race wanted" (qtd. in Said 287). This is why I claim that the whole earth image, an artifact of the program which during the 1960s was thought to, and indeed was designed to, con- firm the nation's claim to be carrying the torch of progress and democracy, performed American ideological work. Reproducing what Alan Nadel calls the "theological" gaze of the United States looking down at the earth-a gaze, like God's, ambiguously benign or terrible-it concretizes Richard Barnet's observation, made in 1972, that "the United States, uniquely blessed with surpassing riches and exceptional history, stands above the international sys- tem, not within it" (qtd. in Said 286).16 If Ammons "gets the grandeurs," then, these are the gran- deurs of American imperialism in 1972 as well as his own. The political gestures he makes in the later, prophetic pages of Sphere are structured by the same vertical synecdoches that obtain in the political sphere. When Ammons claims that "we made and tamed into play each of these States ... now, with the same rasping and groaning, we try to put the nations and communities of nations together" (77), he is projecting a synecdochically structured world. Here is another example, a chain of synecdoches: "a united ca-</page><page sequence="19">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 149 pable poem, a united, capable mind, a united capable / nation, and a united nations!" (79); poem stands for poet, poet stands for na- tion, nation stands for earth. Ammons proposes, in effect, that the relation of the individual to the totality of society, or of the nation to the totality of nations, is synecdochic. These relations-partial, unstable, accidental, and asymmetrical-are better described by metonymy. Ammons occludes by synecdoche, as it were, met- onymic persons and cultures wasted in the process of "taming these states" who do not fit his scheme. If the American whole earth image constitutes an example of that "high / recognition of wholeness" Ammons identified as the effect of lyric in "Essay on Poetics," but lacks the quality of repro- ducibility which he claims the "mechanism" of lyric ensures, it is "unbelieveable," not because "it permits / another wholeness" but because it does not ("Essay" 30). It, in fact, offers a totality and end point lying beyond the liminal, indeterminate space of the "fron- tier" that American writing has conjured for its environment since Whitman,17 a reduction of the relative and changing motions Am- mons has celebrated elsewhere to the total motion of a planet "gliding." As Sphere rises to its epiphany, "we are fueled and pro- visioned" for travel on spaceship earth, troubled only by a ques- tion, "can we make a home of motion?" (76). He concludes: "the orb floats, a bluegreen wonder"; "we're gliding: we are gliding ... this // beats any amusement park by the shore: our Ferris wheel, what a / wheel: our roller coaster, what mathematics of stoop and climb: sew / my name on my cap: we're clear: we're ourselves: we're sailing" (79). As Hugh Kenner said of Joyce's Portrait, Sphere ends up an extended lyric, poised for liberation from the nets of the local and mortal cosmos in which Ammons's work otherwise locates itself.18 One temptation of postmodern open forms, perhaps of the twentieth-century long poem in general, has been gigantism: the move beyond the liminal and undecidable state that makes ambi- tion humble to totality to a discursive imperialism that imposes sameness on its diverse contents. I suggested that Ammons's na- tional identification supports his ambition, and indeed, American poets may be especially tempted by the "American world-poem," whether because their country has literally incorporated a world community through massive immigration, or because it has as-</page><page sequence="20">150 Kevin McGuirk sumed the mantle of world liberator, or because it is the twentieth century's dominant imperial power.19 As Amy Kaplan recently noted in this connection, American literary thinkers have typically "defined the special features of American romance by distinguish- ing it from the imperial tendencies of the English novel" (13). American literature, Richard Chase claimed, "has not wanted to build an imperium but merely to discover a new place and a new state of mind" (qtd. in Kaplan 14). Such a claim and others like it "draw[] on an enduring assumption that the American struggle for independence from British colonialism makes U.S. culture inher- ently anti-imperialist" (14), while the enduring quest along fron- tiers of various kinds has supported this assumption in its search for proofs of American innocence. It would be facile to insist on an absolute correspondence across planes between the American world-poem and American imperialism-an instance of Ammons's "too adequate relationship"-but the ideological continuities are inescapable. What is perhaps more important to observe, in any case, is that both arrive, so to speak, at dead space in outer space, a cultural void utterly unlike anything encountered by Euroameri- cans settling North America.20 Ammons's poem, written in 1972, is belated by the time it is published in 1974. Composed of American optimism, it launches into the new frontier of space and lands in the post-Apollo, post-oil crisis, post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, post-" 1972" American reality, when "there no longer seemed any natural relation between Amer- ican 'freedom' and the conquest of space" (Berube 195). The im- age may be epochal after all; announcing the totalization of the world as object, it signals the conclusion of what Heidegger, identi- fying modernity, called "the age of the world picture." But a "world picture" is supposed to display meaning; this is strictly meaning- less, a cipher-and Ammons's best epiphany is only tautology: "we're ourselves." Attempting to show "how / the bluegreen earth can look purposeful, turn a noticeable margin to meaning," he can- not get far-only to the line beyond which the idea of meaning itself becomes meaningless-because a basic principle of postmod- ern knowledge is denied by the a-contextual status of the earth in space, an object the subject of which has vanished. Perhaps, a pic- ture of the whole planet, Sagan's, Ammons's, or America's, may fi- nally be read as a symbolic panopticon disciplining-overtly in Sa-</page><page sequence="21">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 151 gan's reduction of history to squabbles of mites on a plum-the forms of resistance that make particular lives and communities imaginable. Notes 1. "History," in Diversifications (27). See also "Hippie Hop," in Briefings (38), and Ammons's comments in the Diacritics interview where he elaborates this state- ment to a somewhat tautological conclusion: Whatever you see when you look out of the window at any particular moment is history-is the truest history surviving into the immediate moment. The whole history of planet earth is in your body at this moment, and so on. So that I don't have to structure it into time periods.... I believe that what is here now, at this moment, is the truest version of history. (52). In other interviews, Ammons has repeatedly registered his discomfort with con- temporary history: "I felt all during the sixties, as a Southerner, emotionally un- able to make any commitment to what was going on around me. I felt very defen- sive about my lack of political involvement" (Haythe 180). 2. For as Peter Galison notes, cybernetics may offer either an ideal of explor- atory epistemology or "partiality" (which Wolf reads in Ammons, especially the Ammons of "Essay on Poetics," not Sphere), or the means of fabulous power or "omnipotence" (261). 3. Philip Morrison indicates that the first black-and-white photographs of the whole earth were taken in 1966, though these have not been circulated. The first color shot was taken on 10 November 1967 from geosynchronous orbit. "That very picture of earth remains the most circulated photograph of all the archival treasures of NASA" (141). 4. Here, I mean to evoke the conventional notion of a world picture as a view of life, or ethos, that is, an ideology complexly but unifiedly implicated with and abstractable as a totality from the practices and values of a given age. Later in the essay, I invoke Heidegger's shrewdly elaborated argument that the notion itself of a world picture is peculiarly modern rather than transhistorical: "The world pic- ture does not change from an earlier medieval one into a modern one, but rather the fact that the world becomes picture at all is what distinguishes the essence of the modern age" (120); indeed, "The fundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the world as picture" (134). "Research," or modern modes of representation, at once constitute "Man" as subject and subject the world to this newly imperial subject. The outcome, however, is an ironic one: In the planetary imperialism of technologically organized man, the subjectivism of man attains to its acme, from which point it will de- scend to the level of organized uniformity and there firmly establish itself. This uniformity becomes the surest instrument of total, i.e., technological rule over the earth. The modern freedom of subjectiv- ity vanishes totally in the objectivity commensurate with it. (152-53) 5. Here, I am following Jerome Yaakov Garb's usage in his very useful "The Use and Misuse of the Whole Earth Image."</page><page sequence="22">152 Kevin McGuirk 6. Douglas Crase's introduction to a recent volume of Emerson's essays, in fact, tropes elaborately on this prescience, making it both an instance and figure of Emerson's perceptual freedom. Emerson wrote with his transparent eyeball focussed on the space we would come to occupy. I mean the actual physical space. It's true that we have seen what he could not, the first photograph of earth taken from outside-and in generous moments I suppose we may even regard that photograph as a token of a perspective new in history, the edge and advantage to date of all evolution. (xi) In his own unabashedly Emersonian conclusion, Crase all but equates imaginative freedom and frontier freedom: If we make it into space, the sheer organization of it is bound to com- promise the free movement and perception of the individuals who go; and if we remain on Earth, the sheer pollution of it is bound to compromise the movement and perception of the individuals who remain.... It's true they have taken our forests and prairies, and I hardly have the sky anymore-except here in this book I do. This is the nature they cannot take away. Here we arrive at no wall, our in- finitude ready as a matter of right at whim and-could he really mean what he just said?-the happiness of the universe depends on us. (xxii) 7. In Tim Dean's psychoanalytic reading of American culture, both romantic and frontier ideologies are critical, American modes because they are structured by the repression of the United States's real relationship with its own land, which is one of exploitation. 8. As Patricia Nelson Limerick writes: The promoters of space exploration and development may well qual- ify as the nation's most committed and persistent users of the frontier analogy. Pioneering the Space Frontier, the 1986 Paine commission re- port on the future of the space program, shows the analogy at its most fervent. The story of the American nation, as imagined by the Paine commissioners, was a triumphant and glorious story of success, with the complex stories of Indian conquest and African American slavery simply ignored and eliminated. "The promise of virgin lands and the opportunity to live in freedom," the commissioners declared, "brought our ancestors to the shores of North America." The fron- tiers have not closed, and Manifest Destiny has just taken a turn sky- ward: "Now space technology has freed humankind to move outward from Earth as a species destined to expand to other worlds." The best that the Paine commissioners could offer in recognizing that frontiers might not always be vacant was the memorable line: "As we move outward into the Solar System we must remain true to our values as Americans: To go forward peacefully and to respect the integrity of planetary bodies and alien life forms, with equality of opportunity for all." (88-89) Many writers, as I note later, posit an essential continuity between the early colo- nial exploration and conquest and recent exploration and "conquest" of space. For instance, Burrows writes: "The great voyages of exploration in which Colum- bus, Vespucci, Balboa, Magellan, Cabot, Drake, and the others prowled their</page><page sequence="23">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth 153 puzzling world, in effect fitting its disparate pieces into a comprehensible whole that could be studied at first hand rather than merely envisioned as abstract ge- ometry, would before long trace a route that came to point upward" (25). With this framework, the view of earth is the symbolic conclusion of the first project to know the earth as well as a significant marker of this new phase of exploration. Also, the American appropriation of the adjective "American" is a willful figuring of exploration as a characteristically American activity. Hence, the intensely anx- ious American reaction when the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957, the first spacecraft above earth's atmosphere, providing what Jed Rasula calls "the found- ing trauma" of the U.S. space program (in conversation). 9. What I refer to here is simply the tension between the confident registration of influxes of power from nature and the paralyzing fear that this may be "but a vain belief": power and pathos. Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" is a familiar locus of this dialectic. This tension contributes to romantic subjectivism by encouraging the romantic poet's preoccupation with his own powers, specifically his power to resist historical circumstances by constructing a space (the poem) for the imagina- tion or sensibility. 10. Arendt is writing in response to the question "Has man's conquest of space increased or diminished his stature?" for a "Symposium on Space" organized by the editors of Great Ideas Today (1963). The question emphasized what "the explo- ration of space is doing to man's view of himself and to man's condition. The question does not concern man as a scientist, nor man as a producer or consumer, but rather man as human" (299). She ultimately concludes that space exploration diminishes "the status of man." 11. If Sagan's suggestion were substantial, photographs of the whole earth cir- culated in political hot spots of the globe might have a kind of tranquillizing effect on those petty nationalists struggling with the effects and after-effects of imperialism. In the late 1970s, Hans Magnus Enzensberger critiqued Buckmin- ster Fuller's concept of "spaceship earth," a spin-off of the whole earth image that "belongs above all to the repertory of the American ecological movement": The degree of "false consciousness" contained in these concepts is obvious. It links up with platitudes, which are considered to be "ideal- istic" but to which even that word is misapplied: . . . "We are all in the same boat," and so on. The ideological purpose of such hasty projections is clear. The aim is to deny once and for all that little difference between first class and steerage, between the bridge and the engine room. One of the oldest ways of giving legitimacy to class domination and exploitation is resurrected in the new garb of ecol- ogy. (150) Indeed, to ask the oppressed victims of colonialism (not only of class domination) to identify with citizens of the First World, especially the United States, as mem- bers of "the family of man" riding spaceship earth, and to put aside historical grievances and specifically social ameliorations that might take place, is offen- sively presumptive. Michael Berube's comment on the tensions between the tri- umphalism and optimism of the U.S. space program and the Third World within its borders, "between America's gleaming white space program and burning black inner cities," is pertinent here as well (196). As if we could really have a view from space anyway. In fact, only a few hun- dred humans have traveled above the atmosphere; some of them, especially in the early years, were there for propagandistic reasons. The fact that we all speak</page><page sequence="24">154 Kevin McGuirk as if we really had such a view, not just a photograph, bespeaks the alienation of just about everyone from the centers of power now embodied in gleaming white technology-as well as our unawareness of our alienation. As Dale Carter de- scribed the space program, it provided a national purpose that "has not so much been determined by an active electorate as endorsed by a disabled audience" (183; qtd. in Berube 200). 12. Morrison writes: The match between the casually accepted photographs taken from geosynchronous orbit and the maps we all have long known is an extraordinary one. The sense of that reification, that making real to some form of perception, of what we could only find by measurement is extremely good. The whole chronicle of astronomy makes an ex- tremely persuasive argument, a clinching argument, for any person who wants to adhere to the principles of scientific inference. But that is still not as good as the genuine perception of the new microplanet in the sky. (131) What is meant by "good" here is not clear to me, but the scientism in this state- ment is so bold that Morrison appears to be suggesting that astronomy created this "new microplanet." The photograph just provided the reification that proves this. 13. The whole earth image has been highly valued in the ecological movement, particularly in its public relations aspect, because it appears to restore to the earth something like what Walter Benjamin called "aura." The earth image, then, is an icon requiring a ritual, rather than critical, response. Its oddness with respect to ecological politics is that it works in the same way as bourgeois art, distancing the image to an object of contemplation seen outside of any complicating context. Hoyle must have expected the image to bear something like aura. Our en- counter with it would be as compelling as the encounter with an original work of art or first sexual experience. The planet would be seen in its authentic and unspeakable beauty. But the image is a photograph, of which there is, strictly speaking, no original. Since its early days, very quickly, its aura has been dissi- pated by reproduction and commodification; it is brought closer, eliminating the "distance" Benjamin thought essential to the preservation of aura. Notably, the process of commodification has been accelerated equally by ecological groups who use the image as advertising for events like Earth Day and by industries that offer forms of mastery to consumers chiefly through communications and transport. The history and use of the whole earth image offers an exemplary cultural narrative in foregrounding a tension between commodification within industrial capitalism and the aesthetic reaction. Thus, the jargon of unity persists, just as the jargon of authenticity survived the transport of the poem from ritual to university textbook. 14. This is not the place to summarize the burgeoning work on metaphor and metonymy beginning with Jakobson, but suffice it to note, it is characteristic of postmodern thought to privilege metonymy. Michael Ryan, for example, reads metonymy as a more appropriate mode than metaphor for articulating a post- modern politics. I will suggest that the conservative use of rhetoric can be described as being aligned with the vertical pole of linguistics, which is usually</page><page sequence="25">A. R. Ammons and the Whole Earth associated with metaphor, substitution, and the paradigmatic register (sets of terms that, though different each from the other, serve an identical function or fit into the same slot in a sentence), while the progressive use of rhetoric can be described as more in line with the horizontal axis, which is associated with metonymy, displacement, and the syntagmatic register (which concerns the serial order of terms in relation to other sentences). This is not to say that only con- servatives use metaphors, or that metaphors are conservative in some inherent sense. It is to say that conservatives favour vertical social arrangements, whereby those with wealth and power rightfully rule, while progressives favour a horizontal levelling of such arrangements, both politically and economically. And that difference gets configured rhetorically as the difference between the metaphoric axis and the metonymic. (116) It will be clear that I identify synecdoche as an aspect of metaphor in the sense described here, even though synecdoche and metonymy are often seen as in- stances of one another. 15. The sublime might serve as a major reference point in this discussion, but its requirement of deferral would legislate against the kind of totality Ammons achieves here. As Rob Wilson succinctly states it, "Totalization is the lure yet fail- ure of any sublime" (40). Moreover, Ammons's evasion of terror-he frequently admits it as a term, which by definition resists the sublime-disqualifies his poem from participation in the sublime experience toward which his subject aspires. Speaking more generally, if the American sublime is the void-Wallace Ste- vens's "empty spirit / In vacant space" (131)-then outer space itself would seem an appropriate place for the United States to work out its destiny, and the position of the empty spirit in vacant space viewing earth would be the apotheosis of American vision. Here, we have an apparently radical encounter between Me and the not-Me as absolute SPACE, but really, as Arendt notes, an encounter highly mediated by the technology of Me. 16. I encountered Nadel's fascinating Containment Culture too late to incorporate it into the body of my argument, but I want to indicate its relevance here. Nadel takes "containment" as the name for an entire cultural logic shaping disparate fields of activity in the postwar United States. He argues that the postwar world was constituted for the United States by strict binary divisions-between democ- racy and communism, male and female, straight and gay, white and black, etc. However, the whole that these binaries composed had to be contained by an ever more universalized authority, due to the threat posed to the security of the first item of each pair, and thus to the stability of the whole, by the epistemological obscurity and imminent proliferation of the second. "This authority," Nadel writes, had to "be external to the powers of scrutiny; in other words, it must be theological" (34). If democracy and communism parceled out the world, author- ity over that world would take the form of a godlike or imperial gaze compre- hending the whole earth. Ammons, I would argue, participates in this dynamic of containment and pro- liferation (and this is one thing that marks him as a historically embedded poet). Indeed, if he is identified with process and open form, it is actually his dialectical relation to containment, or poetic form considered conventionally as a container, that makes his work interesting not just as an ongoing essay on poetics, but as a complex response (compared to, say, the New Critical lyric, the poem of contain- 155</page><page sequence="26">156 Kevin McGuirk ment) to tensions shaping U.S. culture on the verge of a decade about to reveal the failure of containment as a political and cultural strategy. Specifically, Am- mons's elaboration of what he calls the "one:many problem" has as a possible political address the postwar dynamic of containment and proliferation. As an insistently dialectical thinker, his particular 1960s looseness or drift (open form as proliferation) toward the "many" finally requires an ever more capacious figure for the "One" with which to counter it dialectically, that is to say, with which to contain it. This is what Sphere, written at the end of the cultural moment called the 1960s, will provide. 17. See David Jarraway's excellent discussion of Ammons's "Essay on Poetics" for an elaboration of this notion. 18. Like most post-romantics, Ammons is attempting to deal with the massive alienation implicit in the whole earth image, but he comes up with nothing more than what Karsten Harries would call "poetry": Our technology demonstrates that Descartes' proud hope that his method would render man the master and possessor of nature was more than an idle dream of the poet. If it had been just that, his shadow would not loom so large. We still stand in that shadow. More and more we tend to make our ability to comprehend the measure of reality. Our commitment to objectivity and transparence forces us to see the world that moves us with its sights and sounds as no more than the perspectival appearance of a reality that yields its secrets only to the dislocated spirit. So understood, reality leaves no room for genuine mysteries. Only the irreducible facticity and temporality of things remain as the last vestige of transcendence. In such a world we cannot feel at home.... Inseparable from this freedom is the desire to reincarnate the dislocated spirit, the longing for words that will let us rediscover where we belong and thus defeat the sense of contingency and arbitrariness which is the other side of objectivity. And yet, in spite of such longing, we find it difficult to step out of the Cartesian shadow. And when the attempt is made it seems to yield no more than poetry: we are offered a vacation from reality rather than its revelation. (88) 19. Paul Naylor's recent discussion of Nathaniel Mackey's ongoing poem has given me the term-American world-poem-which he takes from Mackey's criti- cal writings. Although Naylor hopes to recuperate the American world-poem for a postmodern multiculturalism by elaborating Mackey's effort to resist the ho- mogenizing tendencies of the genre-unlike his precursors, Pound, H. D., Zukof- sky, Duncan (Ammons is not mentioned)-the term itself-not quite an oxymo- ron, something more elusive-points to what may be the profound, indeed structural, problem of American identity. There is no place from which to write a true "world-poem" except outside the world, and the problematics of this position is in part what this essay is about. Mackey's poem might better be described as cross-cultural. 20. It is well known that once NASA landed a man on the moon in 1969-a spectacular rather than cultural experience-public interest in the space pro- gram dropped off, forcing Nixon to cancel the last three Apollo missions. Apollo 16, taking off while Ammons wrote Sphere, was the next to last. See Michael Smith on display value and the Apollo program.</page><page sequence="27">A. R.
