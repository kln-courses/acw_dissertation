         <p>BIOGRAPHERS HAVE TRIED to convey what, at various moments of his life, Darwin must have felt. An affectionate husband and father, he grieved over the loss of his children, agonized about their professional future, took enormous pride in their achievements. Indeed, at times Darwin might even have been hot‐blooded: angry at being misrepresented in public, outraged by social injustice, enthusiastic for nature, joyful in his discoveries.1 Here, in the medium of biography, we have emotional history in a familiar and accessible form. This is one of the attractions of the genre: the secret recesses of feeling are made public. We are happy to know that Darwin was not just a brain secreting theories, but a warm‐hearted man. But this does not take us very far toward an analysis of the place of emotions in scientific practice. I would like to put the materials of biography to different use. The intimate record that survives of Darwin's “private” life, in the form of journals, letters, and autobiography, allows us to approach his emotions from another side, to explore the relationship between his emotional experience and his scientific study of emotions, between detachment, engagement, and sympathy.</p>
         <p>Darwin conducted research on emotions over a period of nearly four decades before the publication of <italic>The Descent of Man</italic> (1871) and <italic>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</italic> (1872), exploring the central role of sentiments and affections in the origin of human beings and the development of moral behavior. His research methods have not been accorded much place by historians of science. By the second half of the nineteenth century, he seems to embody an old‐fashioned, outdated mode of practice, relying on quaint observations and makeshift experiments: the yarn from his wife's needlepoint is used to measure twining plants, a bassoon played by his son to stimulate the sensorium of earthworms.2 Yet Darwin's work on emotions displays a number of the features detailed by historians as integral components of objectivity, in particular his reliance on the latest research in experimental physiology, with its array of graphic technologies, his reduction of emotions to precisely measurable entities that could be recorded by remote observers, and new “wordless” and impersonal methods of collecting and reporting evidence—namely, photography and the questionnaire.3 But unlike many of his scientific contemporaries, Darwin did not engage in objectivity in the controlled space of the laboratory. Much of his research was carried out in his home. He used his children, his friends and extended family, and his pet dogs as objects of study and even experiment. Darwin worried about the influence of emotions within the observer—his own emotions—on the results, especially when the emotions in question involved pain, suffering, or grief: the facial movements of a crying child, for example. It was partly the domestic setting of his scientific work, the proximity of his scientific “objects” to his own familial affections, that prompted his methodological innovations. Though he availed himself of the latest techniques for disciplining emotions, his scientific life was not easily detached from his identity as a father, as a landed gentleman, or indeed as a popular author. Darwin's research on emotions thus allows us to examine the practice of objectivity from the point of view of the subject: as a form of scientific identity, as an authorial strategy, and perhaps even as a kind of emotion.</p>

         <title>THE NOTEBOOKS</title>
         <p>After his return to England, fired partly by his <italic>Beagle</italic> voyage, Darwin commenced wide‐ranging speculations in the now‐famous series of transmutation notebooks. One of these dates from July 1838. The inscription reads: “This book full of Metaphysics on Morals, and Speculations on Expression.” Here Darwin remarked on the physiology of emotion and its roots in animal instinct:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Even the worm when trod upon turneth. … Starting must be habitual involuntary movement from wish to avoid some danger—but it is instinctive because Nancy tells me very young babies start at anything they hear or see which frightens them. — Now every animal moves quickly away from any sudden sound or noise, &amp; therefore brain has been accustomed to send a mandate to the muscles &amp; when the noise comes it cannot help doing it. — (Fanny Hensleigh doubts whether young babies start.)4</p>
            </disp-quote>
Scholars have made much of these notebooks as the fount of all of Darwin's subsequent thought—every groundbreaking idea, every research topic sketched out in miniature. In this passage, we can see Darwin laying a new foundation for emotional life, uprooting the natural theological structure that predominated in British works on the subject and installing a reflex model of emotions as evolved from animal impulses. But the notebooks are also of methodological importance. The cover of this one is marked “Private.” Like the other little red notebooks in which Darwin recorded his first reflections on species theory, it was an intensely private space. It opens with reported conversations between Darwin and his father about curious medical cases. Family and other household members come and go (Fanny was a cousin, Nancy a children's nurse). But the text is completely sealed off. No one else could read it, and it would never migrate to print. This was not just a place to keep “dangerous ideas” secret, but a place of social detachment, of writing about emotions and of expressing his own emotions without regard for the feelings of others or authorial intent. The language is sometimes florid, humorous, metaphorical, as if the privacy allowed a scope for feelings to flow intensely and irreverently; there is an enthusiasm for detail, a passion for theory itself, unchecked by considerations of propriety. Gillian Beer has shown the fundamental importance of this highly metaphorical writing as a seedbed for Darwin's theory. In Darwin's <italic>Beagle</italic> diary, by comparison, the affections are far more composed: the delightful weather, the delicious warmth of the subtropical ocean, the cruelty of slave owners, the tedious suffering of sickness.5 Written in self‐conscious emulation of Alexander von Humboldt's <italic>Personal Narrative</italic>, Darwin's <italic>Beagle</italic> diary was a medium for the crafting of authorial style, and it would become the basis for his highly popular <italic>Journal of Researches</italic> (1839), the book that launched him as a scientific author to a public well beyond the circle of gentlemanly specialists.</p>
         <p>There has been surprisingly little attention to scientific journals as a form of discipline. In his study of weather diaries, Jan Golinski shows the roots of this daily record keeping in the Protestant tradition of journal writing, documenting a spiritual journey, a soul's reckoning with God. He notes, however, the divergence of such diaries from more expressive personal records. In an age of sensibility, in which climate was believed to affect an individual or a whole nation profoundly, the diarist sought to control or suppress the influence of the weather on his own person. Yet this new form of record remained linked to the spiritual diary, for it was itself an exercise of self‐discipline and purification, surmounting corporeal weakness.6</p>
         <p>We find this sort of contracted, observational style in a notebook that Darwin began in 1839 with the birth of his first son, William (see Figure 1). Darwin believed that children expressed emotion more strongly and purely than adults, as they lacked the overlay of culture that allows emotions to be faked or suppressed. He writes of his first child: “Six weeks &amp; four days, smiled repeatedly. … Has no definite power in using its hands. — Made for first time little noises to itself.” The highly impersonal and objectifying form of address is striking. Darwin refers to his son as “it,” while he himself is often completely absent in the text. Emotions are simply reactions. Unlike the species notebooks, however, this one was shared. Darwin's remarks were interleaved with those of his wife, Emma. On the same page, in Emma's hand, we find: “When seven weeks old, his eyes were attracted by a dangling tassel &amp; a bright colour … his smiles were from seeing her face.” Emotions are relational. The boy becomes “he” again, while Emma herself moves into the third person, perhaps to distinguish her observations from those of her husband. The inclusion of Emma in the notebook can be seen as an effort to multiply perspectives and thereby authenticate observations of expression. In the introduction to <italic>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</italic>, Darwin remarked that the subtle and fleeting nature of expressions made them especially difficult to observe. But Emma's very different voice and approach to emotions would later be erased when her remarks were turned, like Darwin's, into raw data. Darwin would return to these pages in order to isolate and categorize bits of expression, using brackets to enclose a fact, red crayon to extract a general point: “smiles before laughs.”7</p>

         <p>George Levine has examined this notebook in some detail and argues that Darwin's detachment was only “apparent.” Darwin's close attention to detail is characterized by Levine as “observant lovingness,” of a piece with his wonder‐infused vision of nature in the <italic>Journal of Researches</italic>, <italic>Orchids</italic>, and <italic>Earthworms</italic> and even akin to his paternal affection for his children. Levine wants to get behind the construct of the scientific self as objective, this “ideology” that is never realized, to something deeper and pervasive. He does so by reading the passages in Darwin's notebook alongside letters that Darwin wrote to his cousin about William, or many years later to Emma about his daughter Annie, as if the feelings expressed in letters can fill in for the (apparent?) absence of feeling in the notebook. He also invokes his own emotional experiences of fatherhood and finally resorts to a different construct, Evelyn Fox Keller's “feeling for the organism.”8 Levine's reading is spirited and provocative. But it encourages a view of the emotional life of science that is undifferentiated, ahistorical, and surprisingly unliterary. Meticulous scientific work does bespeak some form of emotional engagement, and there is no doubt that Darwin felt paternal love. But the question is how and when he expressed such love and how he managed it in relation to his role as a man of science and the very different passions that were enrolled in scientific practice. In order to address these questions, we have to distinguish carefully between the forms of discipline and writing through which Darwin's emotions and those of his research “objects” were observed and recorded: the different types of journals, correspondence, and print, each with its distinctive voice. When Darwin wrote to his family or to a reading public, his language was designed to evoke, as well as to express, emotion. In his observation notebook, descriptions are no longer first‐person experiences in a lyrical narrative of travel or a speculative adventure, but facts in support of a theory. To elide these differences is to gloss over the difficulties, the accomplishments, and the costs of absenting oneself and of objectifying the other. Darwin's observations of William were later commented on by another of his sons: “no sooner was William brought into the world than he was used by his father as scientific material; a minute diary was kept of the growth of the child's faculties. … But Charles Darwin was a devoted father and the most tender‐hearted of men, and when … accurate notes on the act of crying were needed, the man of science disappeared and became the gentlest of nurses.”9 This account relies on a familiar image of the practitioner whose emotions are firmly suppressed in the course of scientific work. But it actually describes something quite different: the disappearance of the man of science and his reemergence as a loving father, able to express the tender feelings crucial to the sealing of domestic bonds (see Figure 2). The father and the scientific observer are not fused; they are split. Objectivity may indeed be a form of feeling, but it is not the same feeling as paternal love (or a love for barnacles and earthworms). When William cried, we must imagine that either Darwin's paternal feelings or his scientific notebook were laid aside.</p>

         <p>We can contrast this acutely divided emotional life with another that emerges as Darwin's children grow older and become involved in his work at various levels: reading, writing, observing, commenting. Having been studied so assiduously as a child, William tried to emulate his father, graduating from his role as a scientific object to a collaborator. After setting up as a banker in Southampton, William wrote to his father in 1866 about heterostyly in <italic>Rhamnus catharica</italic>, observing what were apparently four sexual forms of the flower. Father and son worked together, carefully, precisely, and repeatedly. The elder Darwin wrote: “If your case turns out true (wh. it probably won't) it will be a most interesting discovery &amp; I vow you shall write a paper &amp; publish it. … If you have marked all four forms [of <italic>Rhamnus</italic>] … cut me off some branches &amp; I daresay we could make them strike &amp; then I could experimentise on them [and] give you the results … for <italic>your</italic> paper. … Do not be discouraged if the whole case blows up—I am well accustomed to such explosions.”10 We have an instance, here, of objectivity in the family. Fatherly love, which had been suppressed in order to convert the son into an object of study, can now join with fatherly pride and together sustain patient observation. Filial devotion, in turn, can be expressed through a regimen of scientific restraint, enthusiasm for discovery, and the promise of authorship.</p>

         <title>THE QUESTIONNAIRE</title>
         <p>Darwin resumed systematic research on emotions around 1866, planning to incorporate all of his material on human evolution into a single chapter on “man” (the most domesticated animal) in his book <italic>Variation in Animals and Plants under Domestication</italic> (1868). He began to collect observations of emotions more widely and composed a list of questions about expression that was subsequently printed for ease of distribution. The queries were sent to friends and relations who had infants, but the main impetus was the collection of material on a global scale. Darwin was especially interested in observations of non‐Europeans who had had little communication with white settlers, so that he might gauge how far emotional expressions were cultural and conventional or instinctive and universal.11 He used his existing correspondence network and asked that the printed queries be sent further afield, to missionaries, merchants, and travelers who might have encounters with remote peoples. Replies were returned from Australia, New Zealand, Borneo, Malaysia, China, Calcutta, Ceylon, southern and western Africa, and North and South America.</p>
         <p>Among the questions were: “(2) Does shame excite a blush when the colour of the skin allows it to be visible?” “(10) Is contempt expressed by a slight protrusion of the lips and by turning up the nose, and with a slight expiration?”12 Such precise questions show an enormous compression and narrowing of focus from the early notebook on his children. Darwin has moved from little narratives of development in multiple voices to this tight array of questions about particular emotions and their associated movements. His questionnaire was an extension of the well‐established convention of “notes to travelers” issued by heads of museums or botanical gardens to instruct collectors.13 But the document was also carefully devised so as to prevent the feelings of Darwin's remote observers from coloring their descriptions. The observations had in fact already been supplied by Darwin within the body of each question. All that was required by way of response was a simple “yes” or “no.”</p>
         <p>Despite Darwin's precise instructions, however, many of his correspondents found the questionnaire difficult to apply in a colonial setting. The natives in Ceylon, wrote the botanist George Thwaites in 1868, “all endeavour to drill their countenances so as to express as little emotion as possible before Europeans,” “&amp; really there is usually very little expression at all even when they are talking together, but there is sometimes slyness &amp; sometimes vindictiveness very evidently indicated.” Darwin's efforts to halt the flow of feeling between observers and their objects were frustrated. Replies were often more expressive of British sentiments for other peoples, or vice versa, and of the antipathies to the colonial experience felt by all parties. The Scottish botanist and émigré to Calcutta John Scott wrote: “Shame is … expressed by an averted and declined head with a wavering unsteady askant, eye … though indeed I am rather disposed to regard these as indications of fear than shame—the brute‐like dread of corporal punishment and not the susceptibilities of a moral nature.” Darwin did not typically countenance such racist sentiments in his correspondents, and they are part of the cultural politics of emotion that was edited out as he moved from the collection of information to its display in print. After Darwin received all of the replies to his questionnaire, he collated them on a series of separate sheets. “Fear,” “Astonishment,” “Disgust,” and so forth appeared at the head, followed by a list of observers and their answers. Almost nothing from the letters was transferred except “yes” or “no.” “The same state of mind,” Darwin would later assert in <italic>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</italic>, “is expressed throughout the world with remarkable uniformity.”14</p>
         <p>Darwin's own sentiments regarding race, especially his strong antipathy for slavery and his attachment to missionary causes, are well known. Adrian Desmond and James Moore have recently argued that Darwin's passionate conviction of the “brotherhood of man” fired much of his research on species.15 We can glimpse these sentiments at work in an exchange with an English settler in South Africa, the botanist John Weale. Weale supplied Darwin with observations of African people and also forwarded a set of responses to his questionnaire from a native, Christian Ngqika, a constable in Bedford District, Cape Colony, who had been educated by Scottish missionaries. In answer to Darwin's query 10, Ngqika wrote, “Contempt is expressed by smiling and laughing.” Impressed by the constable's English handwriting, Darwin wrote to Weale: “that I should receive answers by the brother of a Kafir chief is a truly wonderful fact in the progress of civilization.” Darwin pasted a section from one of Weale's own letters, containing observations on the protrusion of the lips in sulky Kafirs and Hottentots, onto Ngqika's reply, collapsing the distance between the civilized native and the English settler. This was a distance that Weale was very keen to maintain. In his next letter he shared observations that he had performed on Ngqika himself, noting his forehead wrinkling and his chin outstretched as he observed a witness in magistrate's court. Weale then remarked: “You speak sanguinely about the civilization of the natives, &amp; the fact that Christian Gaika can write. This appears to me an error into which most people in England fall. … The principles on which [the missionaries] work … is almost purely an appeal to the emotions, &amp; the longer a Kafir has been on a Mission Station the worse servant he is.”16</p>
         <p>From Weale's perspective, Darwin the emancipationist had grown sentimental and allowed feelings of sympathy for the natives' plight to align the observations of a missionary convert with those of a scientifically trained Englishman, potentially corrupting his data on emotions. From Darwin's point of view, the missionary education that Weale denigrated had given the African that mark of civilization essential to a reliable observer: the ability to control one's emotions. We cannot adjudicate these positions, but we can follow the migration of emotions from their collection in the “field” and examine the changes that they underwent as they passed between mediums: from the questionnaire, which reduced emotions to physiological components and served to minimize or erase the emotions of the observer; to the observational encounter as conveyed in letters, in which fear, contempt, and disgust, the very emotions that were supposed to be studied in the natives, were evoked in colonial observers; to the filtering of this emotion‐saturated material for “facts” conforming with the austerity of the questionnaire and its distillation into theory—a process informed by Darwin's own sympathies; and, finally, to the repackaging of this material for an English reading audience, of whose racial prejudices Darwin was all too aware. Ngqika's replies, unlike many Darwin received from Europeans, were offered without embellishment or judgment. Darwin included some of them in <italic>Expression</italic>, and for the sake of his readers he remarked on the “Kafir's rather quaint English.”17</p>

         <title>THE PHOTOGRAPH</title>
         <p>Another technology that Darwin used to address the problem of emotion in the observer was photography. He began to acquire photographs in the late 1860s from a wide range of sources, mostly portraits from commercial firms in Britain and on the continent. A large number of these were child character studies, taken in studios and sold to a public captivated by the new technology and immersed in a culture of Victorian sentimentality. Many of the photographs that Darwin used in <italic>Expression</italic> were obtained from the Swedish art photographer Oscar Rejlander, who had made a reputation in London with his elaborate tableaux vivants of historical scenes, allegories, and portraits of ragged children. Rejlander, who may have had some experience on the stage, also supplied Darwin with a number of images of himself and his wife in highly melodramatic poses.18 Darwin used some of these, and other illustrations of actors, in his book in order to explore whether expressions usually attributed to strong inner feelings could be reproduced volitionally—or indeed through a mechanical apparatus. In <italic>Expression</italic>, the image of the astonished Rejlander appears on the same page with one drawn from the work of the French physiologist Guillaume Benjamin Duchenne (see Figure 3). Duchenne believed that emotional expressions were entirely a product of nervous discharges and, as such, could be reproduced by means of electrodes applied directly to the skin. He used photography to capture these galvanic moments and thereby map the muscles of expression precisely. In another plate from the book Darwin reproduced more of Duchenne's photos, this time to happier effect (the emotion expressed is joy). He aligned these images with child portraits that had been produced in a photographic studio according to the conventions of Victorian sentimentality, domesticating and softening their affect (see Figure 4). Yet at the same time, the series of laboratory images, with the last one showing the probes applied to the face, served as a visual sleight of hand to Darwin's readers, who might have assumed that the expression was accompanied by the feeling of happiness.</p>

         <p>Darwin justified his use of photography on methodological grounds. It allowed for objects that were fleeting in appearance and that evoked disruptive feelings in the observer to be captured and studied at one remove. Darwin showed a selection of Duchenne's photographs to “above twenty persons of various ages and both sexes” (in fact, members of his family and a few scientific friends).19 We can imagine a small dinner party: after the last course is served, Darwin passes around some photographs from Duchenne's album, without explanation; the images show the face of the toothless old man charged with four different electrodes, two on the neck, two on the brow. The witnesses respond: they perceive extreme horror, intense fright, agony, great suffering. It is a nice inversion. The English gentlefolk, guests at a country house, validate the laboratory procedure of a Parisian physiologist. The published text (<italic>Expression</italic>) and illustrations orchestrated a complex movement, from the experimental laboratory to the artist's studio, from the children's nursery to the asylum (Darwin drew heavily on the work of alienists), from the London stage to the colonial outback, from scientific detachment to the extremes of sentimentality and melodrama.</p>
         <p>The same technology that was introduced to remove emotions such as sympathy from the observer was also used to generate and manipulate emotions in the reading public. The grief‐stricken baby, its mouth forming a perfect square, could be clearly discerned as such and lingered over. Parental affection could flow without compromising scientific accuracy. The most famous and popular photograph of a crying child in <italic>Expression</italic> was in fact a composite, made by superimposing the image of a weeping infant onto a familiar domestic background, provided by an artist's sketch of a chair and window (see Figure 5).20 By means of such photographs, Darwin could reintroduce science into the home, advancing claims to explain the basis of feelings manifest there, feelings such as paternal love. Photography removed men of science from the domestic scene in which their sympathies might be aroused. At the same time, it effectively transformed the home and the feelings expressed and experienced therein into legitimate objects of scientific study.</p>

         <title>FEELING FOR THE ANIMAL</title>
         <p>Even more sentimental than the portraits of crying babies were the illustrations of family pets that Darwin commissioned for <italic>Expression</italic>. His favorite dog, Polly, posed for Rejlander, the image serving as the basis for a line drawing showing the devotion of the creature to its master. As Darwin wrote, “Man himself cannot express love and humility by external signs, so plainly as does a dog when with drooping ears, hanging lips, flexuous body, and wagging tail, he meets his beloved master.”21</p>
         <p>Darwin's observations of animals in <italic>The Descent of Man</italic> and <italic>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</italic> have often been criticized for their anecdotal quality and anthropomorphism. But this misses the point of Darwin's argument, which links the human with the animal, especially through a delineation of their shared emotional nature. Darwin argued that the whole range of so‐called higher emotions—curiosity and wonder, conscience, tenderness, devotion—were manifest in animals. The bond between humans and animals was one not just of ancestry, but of sympathy. Darwin had emphasized the importance of sympathy as an instinct, strengthened by exercise, education, and habit, in human nature. The flow of fellow feeling toward others beyond the family circle—to strangers, to the poor and unfortunate, and even to animals—was crucial to the evolutionary history and future progress of human society.22</p>
         <p>Darwin's animal studies for the most part drew on this sympathy. But this was not always the case, nor was it typical of the scientific use of animals in other domains, such as experimental physiology. Here, as in the problem of the weeping child in the nursery, sympathy became an obstacle to investigation. Experimenters and medical men increasingly relied on instruments and procedures that tended to displace their feelings for animals and human patients alike. The place of emotions in scientific practice, of other‐regarding feelings and of passions for discovery, was a matter of acute interest in the debates over vivisection that broke out in the 1870s and carried on through the end of the century and beyond. Leading critics such as Frances Power Cobbe sought to expose the cruelty of an ardent pursuit of science without regard for the feelings of others. Darwin played an important and complex role in these debates. He was courted by different parties to lend his reputation <italic>pro</italic> or <italic>contra</italic> vivisection. Unlike a number of the critics of vivisection, including his wife and his daughter Henrietta, he believed that such experiments were necessary for the progress of science. In fact, his own evolutionary theory of emotion had drawn heavily on a reflex model of feeling that emerged through live animal experiments in the first half of the nineteenth century, and his work on expression brought him into correspondence with a number of leading physiologists in Britain and continental Europe. Contrary to many of the physiologists themselves, however, Darwin believed that animals suffered unnecessarily and that the practice of animal experimentation should be regulated by an independent body. On learning of Cobbe's impending petition to Parliament, Darwin quickly mobilized his own scientific network and, enlisting the legal services of Henrietta's husband, drew up a countermeasure. The simultaneous presentation of these two bills in Parliament provoked the formation of a government commission on the matter.23</p>
         <p>The outcome of this government inquiry, though unsatisfying to most parties at the time, did go some way toward securing the professional autonomy of physiology and, more indirectly, the authority of the institutional laboratory in the life sciences in Britain. It is tempting therefore to equate this outcome with the triumph of mechanical objectivity and its regime of precision instruments and emotional detachment. Such a triumph would seem to signal the demise of the more entangled experimental life of the country gentleman who allowed his work to be interrupted by children and who dissected pigeons and barnacles with a pet dog at his feet. That Darwin was courted by the physiologists, as well as the antivivisectionists, suggests that matters were otherwise. Alongside the isolation of the laboratory as a social space and its gradual institutionalization in universities and hospitals, various biographical media continued to portray scientific work within a domestic setting and the experimenter as a family figure. In his <italic>Autobiography</italic>, composed for his children while these public debates were raging, Darwin described his sympathy for the suffering of animals, which he attributed to the instruction and example of his sisters. Though fond of angling as a boy, he never spitted live worms after learning that they could be killed first with salt and water. He confessed to having once struck a puppy while at day school, though not severely, simply from the sense of power that it gave, an act that still lay heavily on his conscience. In his <italic>Life and Letters</italic>, Francis Darwin dwelt at length on his father's great love for dogs, especially the “delightfully tender” Polly and a half‐breed retriever, Bob, whose abrupt change of demeanor from cheerfulness to dejection at the end of his walks was described in <italic>Expression</italic>.24 Thus in the medium of print, and in the heat of the vivisection debate, Darwin's emotions could play a polemical role, suggesting how men of science might detach themselves from certain feelings in the course of observation, preserving them for moments when they became fathers or walked their dogs. For their part, physiologists conducted experiments without regard for inner feeling, yet in so doing they asserted their own power over emotional life, their superior ability to hold their tender emotions in check. This behavior was in marked contrast, or so they claimed, to that of the critics of experimental practice, the “sentimental public” who were more easily swayed by the dictates of sentiment. It was more laudable to move continually between the worlds of laboratory discipline and domestic sympathy, to be an experimenter as well as a caring father and an animal lover.</p>

         <title>CONCLUSION</title>
         <p>In their recent work, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison link the rise of objectivity, especially “mechanical objectivity,” to the emergence of a new kind of subjectivity, the highly individualized and unified self, centered on the will. Objectivity, they argue, has the almost exclusive purpose of removing or constraining this willful subject, so that the scientific self <italic>as</italic> subject, as person, seems to recede almost entirely, to dissolve into disciplinary practice rather than preside over it. Such practice has been aptly characterized as a kind of asceticism, and we can readily see how the scientific journal (Darwin's observation notebook, say), with its roots in a Protestant tradition of spiritual accounting and self‐abnegation, could serve this purpose. Such scientific activities, with their highly moral ethos, fall nicely under the rubric set out in Michel Foucault's study of classical and Christian asceticism—namely, as “techniques or technology of the self.”25 Foucault's terms are very helpful here, for they allow us to conceive how a highly routinized and even ritualized set of scientific practices, designed to make “objective” knowledge and to eliminate “subjective” influences, could also produce a particular kind of subject, or scientific self. Scientific journals, notebooks, and diaries were not just records of observations and experiments but also spaces for auto‐experimentation, practices of constraint and discipline but also of self‐expression and development—especially when private (like Darwin's species notebooks). Some of the <italic>affects</italic> of asceticism (penitence, abstinence, an obsession with sin and purification) also help to explain some of the emotional undercurrents that run through the history of objectivity. Indeed, if we were to settle on an ontology for objectivity based on Daston and Galison's own text, we would have to regard objectivity as an emotion, for it is repeatedly described in emotional terms: an aspiration, a wishing, a striving, a ferocious devotion, a desire, a passion, a drive, an anxiety, a fear, a feeling—above all—of restraint.26</p>
         <p>A final advantage of invoking Foucault here is that it invites us to think about these “practices of the self” in relation to other developments and formations in the period: How are techniques of self‐discipline embedded and refashioned over the course of the nineteenth century in new forms of disciplinarity that work to depersonalize, and even mass‐produce, the scientific practitioner? The history of objectivity maps nicely onto well‐established narratives of scientific professionalization, the laboratory revolution, the instruments and values of precision, and so forth. Indeed, it is hard to imagine objectivity, as a practice of the scientific self, without these supportive structures and environments. These are developments in which Darwin and the life of the gentleman practitioner seem to have no place. Some of the criticisms that Darwin encountered later in his career from laboratory‐based researchers in France and Germany appear to confirm this. But there are good reasons for including Darwin in this picture—or, rather, for enlarging and modifying our picture so as to include both Darwin's emotions and the routines and practices for studying and redefining the emotions in the “age of mechanical objectivity.” As he collected and observed, analyzed and theorized, through journals, questionnaires, and photographs, Darwin reduced emotions to precise and measurable quantities: heart rate, blood pressure, movements of the facial muscles, angles of the brow, developmental stages in the individual or the species. As emotions became mechanical and reproducible through new technologies, their “quality” faded, their felt experience disappeared. This was quite an achievement. The extraction of emotional “objects” from feeling subjects, so crucial to the formulation of objectivity as a discipline, was itself an accomplishment of the scientific self. Darwin's objectivity was enacted in a series of practices, some more established and ritualized (travel journals, illustration, letter writing, certain forms of print), others more innovative and uncertain (photography, the questionnaire), but all of which served to discipline, display, or transmute <italic>feelings</italic> in different ways.</p>
         <p>Such performances were never isolated, even in the study, the private journal with lock and key, the solitary walk (again the dog was there). They had to share the stage with other practices of the self, as husband, father, friend, colleague, gentleman of means, respectable author. Objectivity, as we have seen, might run in the family—that is, it might become a channel through which parental and filial sentiments could flow. Might other forms of collaborative objectivity, the sharing and imparting of disciplined detachment, in laboratories or teaching hospitals, for example, mobilize similar trains of emotion, those normally associated with familial affections or friendship? Darwin's research on emotions thus bears many of the hallmarks of objectivity, even while it allows us to conceive of objectivity quite differently, as a form of scientific engagement in which a whole range of emotions were brought into play: as part of an emotional economy of science.</p>
