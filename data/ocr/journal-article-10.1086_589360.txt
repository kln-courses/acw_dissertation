         <italic>Brutal Reasoning</italic> explores the role of nonhuman animals—both real and symbolic—in the evolution of early modern ideas about what it was to be human. According to Erica Fudge, animals provided the essential foil against which pre‐Cartesian philosophers, theologians, and literati defined and delineated the boundaries of humanity. So much so, she claims, that “without animals, humans would not only lose companions, workers, sources of food, clothing, and so on; they would lose themselves” (p. 36). Secondarily, <italic>Brutal Reasoning</italic> also attempts to redress what the author rightly sees as a sort of historical cover‐up: a marked tendency within the humanities to ignore or make figurative the animals that were widely referred to in early modern texts. By bringing these animals back into focus, Fudge seeks not only to enrich historical analysis of the period but also to introduce new ways of conceptualizing humans and their place in the world.</p>
      <p>The book comprises seven chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of the debate. Chapter 1 focuses on the so‐called discourse of reason—that is, the relatively single‐minded efforts of early modern thinkers to establish the distinctiveness and superiority of humans over other animals on the basis of the latters' supposed lack of rationality. Initial attempts to uphold this orthodoxy, however, soon ran into a range of conceptual problems (addressed in Chs. 2–5). For instance, if “human” is defined by the possession of a rational soul, what is the status of a young child who is clearly lacking in reason? In short, when does a human become human? Upon conception? At birth? Or at some other point in biological development? In which case, does humanity emerge naturally as a person matures, or does it require cultivation via education? Conversely, if children are like animals, then it follows logically that animals are like children; and if so, should they not therefore be entitled to a comparable level of ethical treatment? Such paradoxes were further accentuated by occasional examples of unusually sagacious animals. Fudge dedicates an entire chapter to the case of “Morocco the Intelligent Horse,” an early version of Clever Hans, who baffled and intrigued sixteenth‐ and seventeenth‐century audiences with his apparent reasoning abilities and whose cognitive capacities were still the subject of philosophical discussion more than a century after his death (reputedly at the hands of the pope in Rome, where the horse and his master may have been burned as witches). Chapter 6 is dedicated to the writings of René Descartes and their influence (or lack thereof) on contemporary English thought. This, and the concluding chapter that follows, provides one of the best summaries of Cartesian ideology and its historical impact that I have ever read. The gist of Fudge's argument is that, by clearly separating the animal automaton from the rational, human “self,” Cartesian dualism not only gave moral legitimacy to human “dominion” over nature and other animals; it also effectively eliminated animals from future philosophical discussions concerning the nature of humanity. In the traditional discourse of reason, being human was a relative concept that depended on the extent to which one was able or willing to transcend animality through the exercise of reason. To Descartes, being human was an absolute distinction, and any reference to, or comparison with, other animals was simply misguided anthropomorphism.</p>

         <italic>Brutal Reasoning</italic> is not without flaws. The historical confines of the book are narrow, and it might have been enhanced by more discussion of medieval precursors to the early modern debate. However, the author provides a compendious and helpful bibliography of both primary and secondary sources that offers the reader ample guidance on where to look for supplementary information. Although thoroughly articulate, the text may be too dry for some tastes, and the subtitle of the book is a trifle misleading given that Fudge devotes nearly as much space to the seminal influence of leading French thinkers—Montaigne, Charron, and Descartes—as she does to the English ones. Despite these minor criticisms, <italic>Brutal Reasoning</italic> is a valuable reappraisal of the early modern period and an important contribution to the growing field of human‐animal studies. More to the point, perhaps, it also speaks directly to current debates in cognitive ethology, evolutionary psychology, and moral philosophy, where the animal/human boundary has once again become a hotly contested territory.</p>
