The study of human behaviour, though now an established member of the fraternity of sciences, has hardly purged itself of methods with no claim to objectivity, and dogmas with no warrant but that of an individual's experiences. Least capable of facing this indictment are those branches of the new science which deal with the social behaviour of man. Psychology and sociology have still a long apprenticeship to scientific method ahead of them. Above all, there is a great deal to be learnt from studies of animal behaviour, which are rapidly attaining an enviable precision and freedom from anthropomorphic bias. The relative ease with which both experimental and observational methods can be applied to the restricted behaviour- repertoire (by human standards) of even such highly developed mammals as monkeys and apes, simplifies the problem for the student of animal behaviour. Nevertheless, it is in this very field of methodology that sociology probably has most to gain from a cordial interest in animal behaviour. It has been the fashion, bequeathed to us by the ardent evolutionists of last century, to invoke animal, and particularly simian behaviour in support of 'theories about the institutions of primitive people such as marriage, the family, matriarchy, and so on, and in discussions of human "instincts" which are supposed to underlie these institutions. Dr. Zuckerman's book is likely to administer a much-needed corrective to such specious transposing of questionable data about animal behaviour to the domain of human problems.

Dr. Zuckerman's book is more than a record of his own mvestigations. It surveys and sifts a vast amount of the literature of simian behaviour, with considerable reference also to studies of other species. Dr. Zuckerman's own researches were confined to baboons, and these mainly in captivity. It seems highly probable, however, from his observa- tions on baboons in the wild state, that what he reports of the colony at the London Zoological Gardens holds for their wild brethren, if in a lesser degree. A solid foundation for the most interesting chapters in the book-those which recount the detailed observations of the, 'family' life and 'social organization' of the baboon colony-is laid in the r6sum6 of the experimental investiga- tions made by the author and other workers of the menstrual cycle im sub-human primates. Unlike the females of other mammalian orders, whose sexual receptivity depends upon the cestrus-cycle and is, therefore, sharply limited to brief periods of heat, female apes and monkeys, like those of Homo Sapien8, are by reason of the menstrual cycle capable of receiving the male at any time. Sex thus becomes the one pole of monkey life, since semi-permanent sexual partner- ship is possible. The other pole is the dominance of the strongest males. These capture all the females, their 'harems' being apparently propor- tional to their relative dominance, and the most food, the remaining males forming bachelor parties. The social pattern is, however, very unstable. Deadly fights over the females, who usually perish in the course of these fights, frequently occur. But this is not the whole story. Turning again to the microscope, the scalpel, and the arbitrament of experiment, Dr. Zuckerman shows how the monkey's anatomical and neurological development endow it with a wide range of reflexes and great susceptibility to conditioning. Sexual responses thus become attached to non-sexual situations, adding complications to the pattem of the baboons' social life. But any social organization, in the anthropologist's sense of the word, does not exist. Mutual aid, for example, has no place in monkey society, pace the pious misinterpretations of armchair sociologists; and matemal responses are wholly reflex in character, depending on the physiological condition of the female baboon. Dr. Zuckerman has added another brick to the rapidly-rising edifice of solid knowledge of sub-human primate behaviour. Many problems still remain to be solved. What determines dominance? Possibly intelligence and 'temperament,' as well as sheer physical prowess, count. Is there any form of leadership in monkey society? The investigation of these and similar problems will be awaited with the greatest interest. The book is well illustrated and includes an excellent bibliography of the literature of primate behaviour.
