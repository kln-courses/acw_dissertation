<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ISLAND WORLDS OF DARWIN AND MELVILLE H. Bruce Franklin I The Galapagos Islands occupy a strangely crucial position in the intellectual history of the past century and a quarter. In 1835, the twenty-six-year-old Charles Darwin, naturalist on the surveying ship H. M. S. Beagle, found himself close to what he called "that mystery of mysteries—the first appear ance of new beings on this earth." Four years later he pub lished his first account of the explorations which were to re shape all his subsequent thought and ours as well. As a recent editor of The Voyage of the Beagle, Leonard Engel, puts it, "In its influence on modern man's outlook upon the world, no voyage since Columbus matches the voyage described in this book." Two years after this account appeared, there arrived at the Galapagos a much less well-known ship, the Acushnet, on a quite different mission, whaling, and manned in part by a twenty-two-year-old seaman, Herman Melville, who also was to write a significant account of what he was to call the En cantadas, or Enchanted Isles. After leaving the Galapagos, the young naturalist contin ued performing his duties, methodically gathering specimens and recording his observations on Tahiti, New Zealand, Aus tralia, the coral islands, and Mauritius. After leaving the Galapagos, the young mariner deserted ship at the first op portunity, spent a month as a prisoner of a probably can nibalistic tribe in the Marquesas, helped lead a mutiny on another ship, and became a jailbird, a beachcomber, and an ordinary seaman on a warship. On his way home to England, the young naturalist prepared a retrospect of his voyage. On 353</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW his way home to the United States, the young mariner sailed in the same ship with, and probably read, the young natural ist's account of his voyage. The views of man's place in nature produced by these two voyages were to become the informing principles of two central documents of the nineteenth (and twentieth) century, The Descent of Man and Moby-Dick. The Galapagos Islands formed a prism that refracted each view, and each of the two men once displayed his view through that prism, Darwin at the innocent beginning of his world-shaking career, Melville after being shaken off by most of the world. Fifteen years after The Voyage of the Beagle, three years after Moby-Dick (which quotes from The Voyage of the Beagle), and seven teen years before The Descent of Man, appeared Melville's The Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles. On the Galapagos Islands each of the two men tries to find ways of ordering human experience and existence in terms of man's relationships to the natural world. Darwin eventu ally perceives a principle of order which forms the tradi tional chain to animate being, essentially a spatial pattern, into a vision of continual evolution, essentially a temporal design. The older view saw "higher" and "lower" forms of being; Darwin added to this static conception an "up"-ward movement in time. This new metaphoric structure, so con genial to the rising middle class and set forth very explicitly at great length, needs little explication. But Melville's vision so violently alienated his middle-class audience that he found it necessary to present it as obscurely as possible. "In this world of lies," as he says in "Hawthorne and His Mosses," truth can only be told "covertly, and by snatches." Hence we must participate in the inmost com plexities of his vision in order to perceive what it is and this participation may often force us into playing painful roles, for the place Melville assigns us in the scheme of things we may find most uncomfortable. 354</page><page sequence="3">DARWIN AND MELVILLE II We approach Melville's Enchanted Isles through a vision of Spenser's Wandering Islands, places of "most deadly daunger and distressed plight," where "whosoever once hath fastened/ His foot thereon may never it secure/ But wandreth ever more uncertain and unsure." "The Isles at Large," Melville suggests, may too be "Darke, dolefull, dreary, like a greedy grave,/ That still for carrion carcasses doth crave"; about them too "wandring ghosts" may "wayle and howle." But as soon as we pass through this allegorical vision spun by highly formal verse, we run into blunt prose familiarly ordering us to confront some plain objects: "Take five-and-twenty heaps of cinders dumped here and there in an outside city lot. . . ." This movement—from vision to object, from remote to fa miliar, from highly formed to fragmentary—found in the first moments of "Sketch First" is to become the dominant move ment of The Encantadas. This movement is fully realized in the two pieces of verse which frame the whole work—the ini tial epigraph from The Faerie Queene and the final epitaph from a remote gravestone on the Enchanted Isles: "Oh, Brother Jack, as you pass by, As you are now, so once was I. Just so game, and just so gay, But now, alack, they've stopped my pay. No more I peep out of my blinkers, Here I be—tucked in with clinkers!" The ten sketches Melville places under the common title of The Encantadas may seem to be, like the islands them selves, scattered heaps of unrelated particulars. Yet they also represent complex relations between Spenser and the anony mous sailor writing doggerel on a tombstone, between sailors and clinkers, between nature and those who confront nature, between those who write and that which is mute, between the appearance of chaos and the semblance of order. "Take five and twenty heaps of cinders," Melville says to the reader. What can better resist the rage to order? As an answer, he begins to make the grandest relations, those be 355</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW tween Heaven and Earth, God and Nature. The nexus of these relations is a notion which joins Heaven and Earth, the notion of "the Promised Land." The Encantadas resembles the Promised Land as its rival in horror, the Encantadas being slightly worse than the worst side of the Promised Land, the Dead Sea. The "desolateness" of the Encantadas easily transcends that of "abandoned cem eteries of long ago" and of "old cities by piecemeal tumbling to their ruin." "Even the Dead Sea," which by implication is the greatest horror in the rest of the world, "does not fail to touch in the pilgrim some of his less unpleasurable feelings." Melville's sketch of the border of the Promised Land then moves in three directions—in a short westward line from the Dead Sea to Idumea, in a sweeping northward arc from the equator to the North Pole, and in a nongeographical move ment along a scale of relative desolation: "the special curse" of the Encantadas, "that which exalts them in desolation above Idumea and the Pole," is simply "that to them change never comes; neither the change of seasons nor of sorrows." So whether or not south of Idumea and west of the Dead Sea, the Encantadas are, "like split Syrian gourds left wither ing in the sun" or "Apples of Sodom, after touching," cer tainly east of Eden: "decayed bits of sugar-cane, bamboos, and cocoanuts, [are] washed upon this other and darker world from the charming palm isles to the westward and southward; all the way from Paradise to Tartarus. . . ." As Melville, who had jumped ship and fled into that western Eden only to feel himself being pampered by cannibals, puts it: "In no world but a fallen one could such lands exist." To see the over-all picture of this cursed and enchanted land beyond the promised one in time, space, and desertness, all one needs is a view like that afforded Moses. Accordingly Melville presents an entire sketch entitled, "A Pisgah View from the Rock." Its two-line epigraph further identifies what is to be shown: —"That done, he leads him to the highest mount, From whence, far off he unto him did show:"— 356</page><page sequence="5">DARWIN AND MELVILLE In The Faerie Queene these lines describe the aged and withered hermit Hevenly Contemplation providing for the Red Cross Knight a vision of the New Jerusalem. In The Encantadas, Melville substitutes himself for Hevenly Con templation as he provides for the reader a broader vision: . . . here at the summit you and I stand. Does any balloonist, does the outlooking man in the moon, take a broader view of space? Much thus, one fancies, looks the universe from Milton's celestial battlements. A boundless watery Kentucky. Here Daniel Boone would have dwelt content. Thus the movement in space has an analogue in the move ment of time from Eden to Jerusalem ("the city of peace") and from the New Jerusalem to Kentucky (an Indian word that Melville translates in The Confidence-Man as "The Bloody Ground"). But the movement of both time and space is contingent upon the movement from Genesis and Exodus to The Faerie Queene to Paradise Lost to The En cantadas, a movement caused by their respective authors and embodied by Adam and the Red Cross Knight, Moses and Daniel Boone. All pilgrims to and colonists of the Promised Land meet again in the seventh sketch. By this time pilgrimage and colonization have been reduced to the level of the Dog-King, who, billing himself as "Supreme Lord of the Island," suc ceeds in getting an assortment of "pilgrims" "to take ship for the promised land." The Dog-King's promises serve to set up a grotesque parody of the rise and fall of human polity. Then with the eighth sketch, in one of the abrupt reversals which characterize all units of composition in these sketches, parody, leaving behind all its props, gives up the stage to tragedy. The ferocious "canine janizaries" of the Dog-King shrink into the "small and silken dogs" of the Chola widow; the comic history of a microcosmic state (from empire to "Republic" to "Riotocracy") yields to the tragic story of the human microcosm (from "the natural negligence of joyful ness" to "Death in a silent picture; a dream of the eye; such vanishing shapes as the mirage shows"); in short, the be 357</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW trayer is replaced by the betrayed. The main difference be tween the object of Hunilla's earthly devotion and the ob ject of her heavenly devotions is that the first is capable of keeping faith; the main difference between the "Supreme Lord" of the seventh sketch and that of the eighth is that one is willfully delusive, the other merely a delusion; Lock-jawed in grim death, the lover-husband clasped his bride, true to her even in death's dream. Ah, Heaven, when man thus keeps his faith, wilt Thou be faithless who created the faith ful one? But they cannot break faith who never plighted it. There are no divine promises; Heaven is as mute and im personal as the clinkers themselves. Nature without God is the touchstone of desolation, in difference, and horror. The enchanted islands significantly lie on the equator, that equivocal line symbolized by Ahab's doubloon, the line at which Ahab and the White Whale twice have their seasonal confrontation. But the equator that cuts the Encantadas is the scene of no monomaniac confrontation with a natural world incarnate in a raging monster; it is instead both cause and symbol of their "special curse" of changelessness: No voice, no low, no howl is heard; the chief sound of life here is a hiss. On most of the isles where vegetation is found at all, it is more ungrateful than the blankness of Aracama. Tangled thickets of wiry bushes, without fruit and without a name, springing up among deep fissures of calcined rock, and treach erously masking them; or a parched growth of distorted cactus trees. Having established this image of natural objects that are frighteningly real, Melville sets up a dialectic with this image, and this dialectic defines Nature. The dialectic began by presenting first a mere allegorical and poetic vision. Passing through this, we found on the other side its opposite: some real, terribly objective objects, more horrifying because of their reality. Now we are asked, how real and objective are these objects? The objects turn 358</page><page sequence="7">DARWIN AND MELVILLE out indeed to be enchanted isles, whose very existence is in some senses delusionary—the variable winds and currents around them had produced "a persuasion, that there existed two distinct clusters of isles in the parallel of the Encantadas, about a hundred leagues apart." In other words, they do share something quite important with the White Whale and the spirit spout which leads to him. Not only did the hard headed buccaneers who sailed from these very islands accept the delusion; "as late as 1750, the charts of that part of the Pacific accorded with the strange delusion. And this appar ent fleetingness and unreality of the locality of the isles was most probably one reason for the Spaniards calling them the Encantada, or Enchanted Group." But this is only one of three reasons. The second reason is that their reality is so hor rible as to seem unreal: But not uninfluenced by their character, as they now con fessedly exist, the modern voyager will be inclined to fancy that the bestowal of this name might have in part originated in that air of spell-bound desertness which so significantly in vests the isles. Nothing can better suggest the aspect of once living things malignly crumbled from ruddiness into ashes. Apples of Sodom, after touching, seem these isles. The dialectic now takes a new turn. The reality of the islands is indeed so horrible as to seem unreal, and the result of this unreal reality or real unreality is indeed that they seem to be "fixed, cast, glued into the very body of cadaverous death," but, lo and behold, life exists in this symbolic and too real place. Once past the view of the isles at large and amidst the details of individual isles, one sees animate life. And the most typical form of life here, an animal, gives its name to the islands. As we turn to this animal, we discover that although it gives another name to the islands it constitutes the third reason for the name Encantadas: Nor would the appellation, enchanted, seem misapplied in still another sense. For concerning the peculiar reptile inhab itant of these wilds—whose presence gives the group its second Spanish name, Gallipagos—concerning the tortoises found 359</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW here, most mariners have long cherished a superstition, not more frightful than grotesque. They earnestly believe that all wicked sea-officers, more especially commodores and captains, are at death, (and, in some cases, before death) transformed into tortoises; thenceforth dwelling upon these hot aridities, sole solitary lords of Asphaltum. So, as in Moby-Dick, a "frightful" and "grotesque" sailor superstition creates a reality and defines the central thematic and symbolic unity of the whole work. In The Encantadas life is a form of death. The view of the isles at large ends by carrying the dialectic to its logical point of development so far. A view of Nature, objective reality, becomes psychological reality; the objective objects of Nature become transmuted by the mind into sym bols of complete and ultimate objectivity; Nay, such is the vividness of my memory, or the magic of my fancy, that I know not whether I am not the occasional victim of optical delusion concerning the Gallipagos. For, often in scenes of social merriment, and especially at revels held by candlelight in old-fashioned mansions, so that shadows are thrown into the further recesses of an angular and spacious room, making them put on a look of haunted undergrowth of lonely woods, I have drawn the attention of my comrades by my fixed gaze and sudden change of air, as I have seemed to see, slowly emerging from those imagined solitudes, and heavily crawling along the floor, the ghost of a gigantic tor toise, with "Memento****" burning in live letters upon his back. It is the reader who must enact this vision so like and so unlike Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death"; from his own mind, he must fill in the deadly blank; he must remem ber "mori." Ill Melville has now set up his questions and the symbols whose movements are to provide answers to these questions. The next step is to explore the living symbol which animates the others—the tortoise. Melville devotes the second sketch, "Two Sides to a Tortoise," to this exploration. These two 360</page><page sequence="9">DARWIN AND MELVILLE sides of the title are deceptive because there are two quite different ways to take these two sides. The first is the one ex plicitly pointed out by the narrator's words; the second is implied in the narrator's deeds. We might call the first sym bolic; the second we might call animalistic or naturalistic. The narrator tells us that "the tortoise, dark and melancholy as it is upon the back, still possesses a bright side; its calipee or breast-plate being sometimes of a faint yellowish or golden tinge"; "The tortoise is both black and bright." Besides this obvious symbolic value, which is offered as a qualification of the symbolic value established in the first sketch, we find that the tortoises carry the narrator back through time, past the Coliseum to the beginnings of the Hindu world, and out through space: they seem "the identical tortoises whereon the Hindoo plants this total sphere." Thus they symbolize death in life, life in death, timelessness, creation, and a dou ble-sidedness unlike the delusive double of the isles at large. But that is not all; they also symbolize the ethical problems central to all life: "Their crowning curse is their drudging impulse to straightforwardness in a belittered world." Splen did symbols are these tortoises, with their hideous natural life: Listening to these draggings and concussions, I thought me of the haunt from which they came; an isle full of metallic ravines and gulches, sunk bottomlessly into the hearts of splintered mountains, and covered for many miles with inex tricable thickets. I then pictured these three straightforward monsters, century after century, writhing through the shades, grim as blacksmiths; crawling so slowly and ponderously, that not only did toad-stools and all fungus things grow beneath their feet, but a sooty moss sprouted upon their backs. They are such splendid natural symbols that they can carry the narrator to a nightmarish cosmic revelation: With them I lost myself in volcanic mazes; brushed away endless boughs of rotting thickets; till finally in a dream I found myself sitting crosslegged upon the foremost, a Brahmin similarly mounted upon either side, forming a tripod of fore heads which upheld the universal cope. 361</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Yes, splendid symbols are these marvelous tortoises; imagine these marvelous symbolic beings living for centuries (in tor ture) on their beautiful golden calipees. Living, that is, un til they encounter a symbol-maker: Such was the wild nightmare begot by my first impression of the Encantadas tortoise. But next evening, strange to say, I sat down with my shipmates, and made a merry repast from tortoise steaks and tortoise stews; and supper over, out knife, and helped convert the three mighty concave shells into three fanciful soup-tureens, and polished the three flat yellowish calipees into three gorgeous salvers. To see exactly what Melville is up to here, one must be fa miliar with the book upon which this and other passages of The Encantadas are in part commentaries—Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle. Darwin provides both the method and the images for Mel ville's symbol-making: The day was glowing hot, and the scrambling over the rough surface and through the intricate thickets was very fatiguing, but I was well repaid by the strange Cyclopean scene. As I was walking along I met two large tortoises, each of which must have weighed at least two hundred pounds: one was eating a piece of cactus, and as I approached, it stared at me and slowly stalked away; the other gave a deep hiss and drew in its head. These huge reptiles, surrounded by the black lava, the leafless shrubs, and large cacti, seemed to my fancy like some antediluvian animals. While making his symbols, Darwin had done a similar thing with them: While staying in this upper-region we lived entirely on tor toise-meat: the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do carne con cuero) with the flesh on it, is very good, and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent. Nourished on his symbols, Darwin, like Melville's narrator, tries to quest into their ultimate significance. For Darwin the archipelago is a little world within itself. . . . Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to 362</page><page sequence="11">DARWIN AND MELVILLE that great fact—that mystery of mysteries—the first appear ance of new beings on this earth. Melville just goes a step beyond in his quest into this sym bolic little world within itself, seeing as the mystery of mys teries the appearance of being itself. IV Melville challenges and parodies Darwin on grounds far dif ferent from the grounds on which Darwinism was shortly to be so violently attacked. He accepts the age of animate na ture; he accepts the intimacy of man and beast; he accepts empirical observation and rejects revelation. But Melville rejects Darwin's particular observations, his use of these ob servations, and his metaphoric structure. That Darwin provided materials for The Encantadas (as various people have been suggesting during the last quarter of a century) seems undeniable. It would also seem that Mel ville meant his reader, as distinguished from what he called "the superficial skimmer of pages," to recognize these ma terials. In the fifteen years which had elapsed since the first publication of the book we now call The Voyage of the Bea gle, it had become enormously popular; Melville himself had owned a copy for seven years; of course he knew that its long and important chapter entitled "Galapagos Archipelago" was far and away the best known account of the islands. And this is how Melville deals with Darwin: Here be it said that you have but three eye-witness author ities worth mentioning touching the Enchanted Isles:— Cowley, the Buccaneer (1684); Colnet, the whaling-ground ex plorer (1798); Porter, the post captain (1813). Other than these you have but barren, bootless allusions from some few passing voyagers or compilers. Melville's running quarrel with one of these "passing voy agers or compilers" is an important part of The Encantadas, and apparently derives in part from contempt for the great naturalist's famed powers of observation. The contest be tween these two eagle-eyed observers of nature has several 363</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW kinds of significance. Who better observed tortoises may be a matter of mere idle curiosity or symbolic convenience: Darwin: In order to secure the tortoises, it is not sufficient to turn them like turtle, for they are often able to get on their legs again. Melville: Moreover, everyone knows that tortoises as well as turtles are of such a make, that if you put them on their backs you thereby expose their bright sides without the possibility of their recovering themselves, and turning into view the other. But who better observed the bird life of the islands is a mat ter of some importance, at least to biology. After all, Dar win's observations of the birds of the Galapagos were funda mental to all his subsequent theoretical statements about species. Melville's observations of the birds of the Galapagos also lead to an ordered stratification; he places the myriad fowl of Rock Rodondo on stratified shelves, arranged ap proximately in order of viciousness, "thrones, princedoms, powers, dominating one above another in senatorial array." Darwin is puzzled to find that "of waders and water-birds I was able to get only eleven kinds." And "considering the wandering habits of gulls," Darwin is quite surprised to find only one kind of gull and that kind peculiar to the islands. Melville perceives amidst the "unnumbered sea-fowl" many species including "gulls of all varieties," and he suggests the reason for Darwin's failures: "I know not where one can better study the Natural History of strange sea-fowl than at Rodondo. It is the aviary of Ocean." Needless to say, this "I" actually climbs Rodondo whereas Darwin never mentions it. But, suggests Melville, even if Darwin had seen or gone to Rodondo, he, not being a common mariner on a predawn fishing party, might have missed everything: But the dawn is now fairly day. Band after band, the sea fowl sail away to forage the deep for their food. The tower is left solitary, save the fishcaves at its base. Its bird-lime gleams in the golden rays like the whitewash of a tall light-house, or the lofty sails of a cruiser. This moment, doubtless, while we 364</page><page sequence="13">DARWIN AND MELVILLE know it to be a dead desert rock, other voyagers are taking oaths it is a glad populous ship. Having questioned Darwin's individual observations, Mel ville is now ready to parody his method of collecting and presenting them. Darwin presents to the reader a chart of the species of Leguminosae collected by him on the islands: Name of Total No. No. of Species No. of Species No. con No. of Species con Island of Species found in other confined to fined to fined to the Galapa parts of the the Galapagos the one gos Archipelago but world Archipelago Island found no more than the one Island James Island 71 33 38 30 8 Albemarle Island 46 18 26 22 4 Chatham Island 32 16 16 12 4 Charles Island 68 39 29 21 8 (or 29, if the probably im ported plants be subtracted) Melville presents to the reader a chart of the population of Albemarle Island, "according to the most reliable estimates made upon the spot": Men none Ant-eaters unknown Man-haters unknown Lizards 500,000 Snakes 500,000 Spiders 10,000,000 Salamanders unknown Devils unknown Making a clean total of 11,000,000 But Darwin's methods and their results are for Melville no mere bad joke. 365</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW One of the most interesting things about The Voyage of the Beagle is that it shows Darwin habitually working not, as might be expected and as the Social Darwinians did, from a perceived order in Nature to moral analogies but from a moral order to perceived analogies in Nature. Darwin's Na ture is an anthropomorphic world in which lizards seem to say, " 'What made you pull my tail?' in which "It required little geological practice to interpret the marvellous story which this scene at once unfolded"; and in which he would eventually find universal application for such metaphors as the "Struggle for Existence" and "Survival of the Fittest." Throughout most of this, his first book, Darwin is looking through "the scale of civilization" for a corresponding order in Nature. The huge discovery towards which he moves is that the analogies can be reversed: "The varieties of man seem to act on each other, in the same way as different species of animals—the stronger always extirpating the weaker." In one of the last paragraphs of the book, as he ruminates on all that he has uncovered, Darwin turns his mind back into time to forge the linked analogies which are to bind innumerable unborn minds: Of individual objects, perhaps nothing is more certain to create astonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a barbarian—of man in his lowest and most savage state. One's mind hurries back over past centuries, and then asks, could our progenitors have been men like these? men, whose very signs and expressions are less intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals; men who do not possess the instinct of those animals, nor yet appear to boast of human reason, or at least of arts consequent on that reason. I do not believe it is possible to describe or paint the differ ence between savage and civilized man. It is the difference between a wild and tame animal; and part of the interest in beholding a savage is the same which would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his desert, the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle, or the rhinoceros wandering over the wild plains of Africa. 366</page><page sequence="15">DARWIN AND MELVILLE One can easily imagine Melville's response to this passage. Sketch Ninth, "Hood's Isle and the Hermit Oberlus," seems to be his reply. This island is notorious because of "a wild white creature who spent many years here; in the person of a European bringing into this savage region qualities more diabolical than are to be found among any of the surround ing cannibals." Oberlus identifies himself with Caliban, whom Prospero refers to as "thou tortoise." The "beast-like" Oberlus with his "pure animal sort of scorn for all the rest of the universe" exists partly to turn Darwinian order upside down. His pri mary function in The Encantadas, however, is to turn Dar winian order into a tool with which to shatter the very no tion of ordered scales of being. Darwin observes about some of the non-Europeans he sees on his voyage: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man; it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as there is a greater power of improvement. Melville observes about the European Oberlus: Indeed, the sole superiority of Oberlus over the tortoises was his possession of a larger capacity of degradation; and along with that, something like an intelligent will to it. The descent of man below animals who are symbols of the ut most degradation, death-in-life, is only one step towards the piercing of Nature's masks. The sketch which presents Oberlus follows the sketch which presents Hunilla. That is, there seems to be an abrupt slide down a scale of being defined by Hunilla at the apex, Oberlus at the nadir, with tortoises—which are more or less interchangeable with such beings as living or dead sea-cap tains—someplace in between. But that is only one appear ance. Hunilla has other possible relations with Oberlus and with other things and beings. She possibly descends from Oberlus and ascends to perfection; the reader, by having in part to write his own story of Hunilla, must define himself in terms of rocks and reptiles. 367</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Oberlus "about half a century ago" began his stay in the Encantadas, where he "spent many years." After leaving, he "proceeded to Payta; there, with that nameless witchery pe culiar to some of the ugliest animals, wound himself into the affections of a tawny damsel." All we know about Hunilla's origin is that she is a "half-breed Indian woman of Payta." Two years before The Encantadas, Pierre, a book whose title and title character make elaborate new puns on Christ's momentous pun on Petra, displayed a hero metamorphosing into a divine rock. Hunilla, too, has her metamorphosis into the divine: "Humanity, thou strong thing, I worship thee, not in the laureled victor, but in this vanquished one." One should note several things about the narrator's worship of Hunilla: that it comes with and fulfills his rejection of God; that it immediately follows and complements his pa rody of heroic history ("Charles's Isle and the Dog-King"); and that it immediately precedes and sets up his inversion of natural history ("Hood's Isle and the Hermit Oberlus"). This worship is an alternative to the worship of God, of man as hero, or of man as animal. Hunilla, the object of this wor ship, has become literally an object embodying in part the qualities of the nonliving. After Hunilla sees the vision of "Death in a silent picture; a dream of the eye; such vanishing shapes as the mirage shows," she buries the body that remains and the life remain ing with it: " 'I buried him, my life, my soul!' " At the end, the narrator sees her as she sits "motionless," "silent," with "rigid hands": "A heart of yearning in a frame of steel. A heart of earthly yearning, frozen by the frost which falleth from the sky." We are not far from the last word of The En cantadas—"clinkers!" If the ultimate perfection is becoming as one with the clinkers, it is a perfection as yet denied to both reader and narrator. Their roles have quite other—and quite explicit— relations within the symbolic structure of The Encantadas. There are "two unnamed events which befell Hunilla on this isle," untold simply because the narrator refuses to tell 368</page><page sequence="17">DARWIN AND MELVILLE either one to the reader. Instead of supplying the "facts," the narrator supplies ellipses. The first ellipsis yields one set of relations between words and things: And now follows Against my own purposes a pause descends upon me here. One knows not whether nature doth not impose some secrecy upon him who has been privy to certain things. At least, it is to be doubted whether it be good to blazon such. If some books are deemed most baneful and their sale forbid, how, then, with deadlier facts, not dreams of doting men? Those whom books will hurt will not be proof against events. Events, not books, should be forbid. Whether "facts" or "dreams" are the deadlier is one of the central questions of the entire work, and from its answer would seem to hang the significance of what is to go in the blank. But the narrator then seems to be merely restating the blank: When Hunilla Dire sight it is to see some silken beast long dally with a golden lizard ere she devour. More terrible, to see how feline Fate will sometimes dally with a human soul, and by a name less magic make it repulse a sane despair with a hope which is but mad. At this point, the reader, caught in the toils of the blank, ap plies Melville's linked analogies to Hunilla's situation and to the natural world of cats and lizards, Fate and man. But the next sentence shows the reader where he is caught: "Unwit tingly I imp this cat-like thing, sporting with the heart of him who reads; for if he feel not he reads in vain." And where does this place us? To understand the world that Melville is creating, the reader must fill in the blanks himself. Unfortunately, the reader has only one place to which he can go to find mater ials to fill in the blanks. That place is the inside of his own head. If he can find in the inside of his head the worst of hor rors, where does he rank on any scale of being? The second unnamed event sets the hook of the problem: "There were more days," said our Captain; "many, many 369</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW more; why did you not go on and notch them, too, Hunilla?" "Señor, ask me not." "And meantime, did no other vessel pass the isle?" "Nay, Señor;-but " "You do not speak; but what, Hunilla?" "Ask me not, Señor." "You saw ships pass, far away; you waved to them; they passed on;—was that it, Hunilla?" "Señor, be it as you say." Braced against her woe, Hunilla would not, durst not trust the weakness of her tongue. Then when our Captain asked whether any whale-boats had But no, I will not file this thing complete for scoffing souls to quote, and call it firm proof upon their side. The half shall here remain untold. Those two unnamed events which befell Hunilla on this isle, let them abide between her and her God. In nature, as in law, it may be libelous to speak some truths.
