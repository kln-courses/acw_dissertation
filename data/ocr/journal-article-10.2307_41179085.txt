<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF MIND: The Ancestral Sources of Human Feelings Jaak Panksepp One of the great challenges of the mind sciences is the clarifi- cation of the gifts of nature that reside at the foundation of our mental apparatus. Clearly, the capacity to have primal emo- tional feelings is one of those gifts. Emotional feelings - reflect- ing the brain's capacity to elaborate an affective form of consciousness - have such a long evolutionary history that no one can trace their origins with any assurance. My goal for this essay is to provide an overview of how an emerging field called affective neuroscience is seeking to reveal the brain intricacies that are essential for our emotional lives. The scientific details can be found elsewhere (Panksepp, 1998a), but I must forewarn the reader that this approach to understanding the underbelly of consciousness is based very much on evolutionarily informed animal brain research where the essential issues can be studied in the necessary detail. Affective processes are surely much older in brain evolution than our unique human capacity to dwell cognitively on our feel- ings. Although we can be certain of little in this emerging area of knowledge, we can be confident that affective consciousness has an evolutionary history that can only be deciphered by studying the psycho-behavioral capacities of living animals. The brain sources of such mysteries are not readily accessible in humans. Indeed, it is possible that the answers we can derive from studies of other animals will be clearer than those found in studies of ourselves, especially since animals do not have the complex cog- Jaak Panksepp is Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Bowling Green State University and Head, Affective Neuroscience Research, Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics, Northwestern University.

While some are convinced that consciousness is a property of all matter, most, including myself, remain convinced that con- sciousness is a function of living matter, especially the electro- chemical actions of brains interacting with bodily complexities and external environments. Although most brain scientists are happy to seek the correlates of conscious experiences within the highest reaches of the human brain - especially in the ne- ocortex, where higher order thoughts (HOTs) are organized - others seek the roots of consciousness in the intrinsic needs and survival values of bodily functions that are represented in more ancient "embodied" functions of the brain. For the past thirty- some years, I have sought the primordial glimmers of affective consciousness among the subcortical emotional and motivational systems of animal brains - among, that is, the neural circuits we and other animals possess as a shared heritage of our evolution- ary past (Panksepp, 1998a). My guiding assumption has been that many other species, es- pecially all the other mammals, also experience basic affective feelings. All too many of my colleagues disagree with this view- point. They continue to impale themselves on the agnostic di- lemma: They argue that we can have no direct evidence of animal emotional feelings since such mental attributes cannot be directly observed, and they worry about how insubstantial things like "mind" could influence matter (conveniently forgetting the mental capacities arise from the material processes of brain). Thus, despite a mass of indirect evidence to the contrary (Pank- sepp, 1998a), most experimental psychologists and neuroscien- tists are unwilling to entertain explicitly the likelihood that affective experiences exist in the mental terrain of other animals (for the most recent influential statement of this position, see Damasio, 2003). Their skepticism has a long and deep-seated his- tory in the profession, and derives from a scientific need for con- ceptual rigor (for a critique, see Rollin). Indeed, it is hard to distinguish between emotional actions and emotional feelings, but sophisticated behavioral experiments continue to affirm that such brain processes are part of the mental apparatus of even lowly laboratory rats (Dickinson and Balleine). Their existence makes eminent sense. After all, our own positive affective exper-</page><page sequence="3">An Archaeology of Mind 43 iences help us engage aspects of the world in ways that are valua- ble because they sustain life, while our negative affective experiences inform us of those dangers that must be avoided be- cause they compromise life. Many of these feelings are intrinsic brain/mind tools that we have inherited as gifts of nature, even though they link up quickly to all manner of learning mecha- nisms. Of course, affirming the presence of feelings in other ani- mals says nothing about whether other animals actively think about their feelings in ways we humans are prone to do. When it comes to HOTs, we surely put practically all other animals, per- haps even dolphins, to shame. There are many evolutionary layers to the mammalian brain/ mind (MacLean, 1990), and the more ancient instinctual and af- fective layers were there long before the massive neocortical ex- pansions that allow us to dwell on the word in uniquely human ways. To make sense of affective experience, we must be willing to see beyond those higher aspects of the human mind, as well as beyond the apparent unity of consciousness, to the deeper evolu- tionary layers that are essential for the construction of more an- cient forms such as affective consciousness (Panksepp, 2001a, 2001b, 2003a). Although many who are devoted to the analysis of human cognitive functions are prone to conflate emotions and cognitions (e.g., Lane and Nadel), some others are beginning to recognize that when we study emotions, we need to distinguish between "first order phenomenology" and "second-order aware- ness" (Lambie and Marcel). My own view is more sympathetic to the later position. Affective experience is first-order phenome- nology - a primary process in the formation of consciousness. Brain scientists are just beginning to deal with emotional reali- ties in ways that recognize the primal texture of affective con- sciousness and the primal state processes of the nervous system that may be substantially distinct from the neural weave of our cognitive consciousness - the more recent information-process- ing channel functions of the brain. As we will see, many heated arguments concerning the degree to which emotions and cogni- tions are distinct in the brain could be resolved by distinguishing between those ancient brain state functions and more recently evolved neural channel functions. This would also allow scholars to appreciate better the essential role of neurobiological re- search in other animals in clarifying the nature of the human</page><page sequence="4">44 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp mind. The primal state functions are thoroughly organic processes that evolved in ancient time; they can be described ver- bally, but they really cannot be scientifically understood at that level. By contrast, since cognitive functions are more dependent on environmental subtleties, we can often get more intellectual satisfaction from non-biological approaches to those higher or- der processes. Of course, our basic emotional feelings and our thoughts about the world are thoroughly blended, and the cognitive appa- ratus may have been built upon, and remain interconnected with, emotional and motivational state functions. Without the deep affective grounding of consciousness, cognitive conscious- ness probably could not exist. In any event, these two aspects of the brain have a sufficient number of distinct characteristics. But some of those distinctions run against the grain of the guiding metaphor of modern cognitive science - that the brain is just a very sophisticated computer-like information-processing device. With more than a pinch of oversimplification, let me highlight these contrasting views. Emotional States and Cognitive Information Processing For the past three centuries, two views of mind have been vying for supremacy. One view sees the conscious human mind as aris- ing from the brain's symbol-manipulating abilities, abilities not that dissimilar, in principle, from modern computers. If that view is fundamentally correct, then mind can be recreated in non-liv- ing matter through our ability to fathom the underlying compu- tations, and we should be able to re-instantiate mind on non- biological platforms, such as digital computers, since these can perform the needed calculations. In that view, mind is an infor- mation-processing function that is independent of the type of de- vice on which the relevant information is processed, and brain science is really not needed to solve the puzzle of the human mind. This is one functionalist view of the mental apparatus. Adherents of this type of neuro-mathematical idealism remain enticed by the possibility that minds are created "merely" from the capacities of brains to process symbolic codes. Some extreme Platonic versions of this view imagine that brains may contain in- trinsic symbol-processing capacities evolutionarily designed to ex- tract important features from environmental stimuli. Such</page><page sequence="5">An Archaeology of Mind 45 capacities, for example, would give us the concept of "chairness" and allow us to recognize the infinite diversity of chairs in the world. Among adherents of such views, the capacity of the brain to generate HOTs is often seen to be the cardinal feature of con- sciousness. Proponents of such views believe that the capacity for subjective phenomenal experience may, in fact, be largely unique to the human species and perhaps shared only by a few other closely related primates (Damasio, 2003). This has long been a prevailing, if not predominant, assumption in cognitive science and analytic philosophy. In contrast to this, the minority position, ever increasing in in- fluence, is a more "embodied" organic view, which posits that minds are integrally linked to brains and bodies as well as to the environments in which they operate. In this view, infants are born with certain natural skills and proclivities that prompt them to reach out and explore actively and to engage affectively their environmental circumstances (Meltzoff and Decety; Trevarthen). Adherents of this type of "naturalism" believe that we learn con- cepts such as "chairness" through our actions, through our search for and satisfaction in finding places in the world where we can rest our sometime weary bodies. Further, we learn to ne- gotiate the social terrain through our active capacity to establish inter-subjective spaces where we mutually create the social tex- ture of our lives through our ability to blend our affective desires with those who care about us. This view acknowledges the deep nature of our sense of agency, and our primordial desire, present in a rudimentary form at birth, to live life actively as opposed to simply being molded, as some still believe, by the reinforcement contingencies of the environment (e.g., Rolls). In this view, na- ture has given us many tools to explore and confront the world, and our capacity to experience affect informs us about what is good, bad, and neutral in our environments. These feelings help guide our life choices; they facilitate our attention and learning. Thus, the capacity of the brain to generate affective feelings is the source of behavioral reinforcement and the primal source of consciousness, and it is a capacity we share with many other animals. I subscribe to the notion of full embodiment, where mind is completely neuro-organic and interpenetrant with the body and environment. According to this view, the philosophical "brain in</page><page sequence="6">46 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp a vat" would surely have a very impoverished mental life. To high- light how degraded our minds might become in such a sparse environment, I would share, with permission, an as yet unpub- lished poem, "Lost" (by Brian Smith of Portsmouth, UK): blacker than the black of deepest space for there the stars of heaven cast light relief .... bleaker than the awesome gloom of hell where passion fuels the flames and is consumed . . . the darkness swirls it holds without a touch envelopes all with suffocating folds .... infinity of emptiness devoid of place . . . the mind alone . . divorced from sentience imprisoned in an unwalled cell of thought without communion . . no other but the other self to love or hate and pointlessly interrogate . . . dissolved in the liquidity of abstraction . . intellect in immortal isolation . . cast away within a sea of introspection . . the memories like dying friends departing as timeless time inestimably runs its unrecorded course .... selfless self cries tearlessly for sleep in vain . . no milestones of shared experience to mark the untold moments passing . . wandering immobility. . .pondering the paradox is all there is for marking time is not an option .... time exists because of change . . decay swings the pendulum and all runs down when this is held at bay . . thus seconds are unborn . . but endless now remains blacker than the black of deepest space Whether the darkness of a cognitive "mind in a vat" could be well illuminated by affective lightning during the neuronal storms of dreaming sleep is interesting to consider, especially since the REM state may reflect the operation of ancient emotional processes that had to be suppressed by more recent neural devel- opments (Panksepp, 1993). For me, the above poem also evokes an image of the "cognitive brain" that is no longer in contact with the fully embodied, affective place of mind in nature. I think it is within those dynamically embodied "folds" of the mind that the differently textured varieties of affect will be found. The affective components of mind give a living and a lived-in ground- ing for the capacities of our more recently evolved cognitive ap- paratus. In my estimation, it is the affective brain that is the home of "the soul" - or as some of us would say, the core self</page><page sequence="7">An Archaeology of Mind 47 (Damasio, 1999; Panksepp, 1998a, 1998b). The information-flow, diagram-makers of cognitive science are prone to ignore such as- pects of mind, for their tools are not well suited for probing the deeper nature of the affective mysteries. However, cognitive neuroscience has now told us a great deal about how human be- ings receive, integrate, store, access, and compare information from the environment. In contrast, it has had a more difficult time explaining what it is that biases our attention to receive in- formation selectively and how stored information is selected for further cognitive processing. Those are the types of questions that affective neuroscience may be able to answer. These disparate views of mind have been battling for primacy ever since Descartes separated the mind and body while his younger contemporary, Spinoza, pursued a rearguard action, urging a more unified, fully embodied view. Modern brain re- search can support variants of both views, and it is especially at- tractive to envision how the more recent cognitive (partly computational) abilities are still anchored to more ancient affec- tive (deeply organic) processes. Rather than allowing one per- spective to prevail over the other, which has happened during the last quarter century of "cognitive imperialism," it is now time to synthesize the best of each. Finally, effective empirical strate- gies can be developed to analyze how the cognitive-affective mind is instantiated in brains interacting with bodies and envi- ronments. To do this well - namely, scientifically - we must parse consciousness into its affective and cognitive forms. It seems likely that our cognitive abilities are grounded in earlier affective developments in brain evolution. This would explain the strong linkages between consciousness and affect and why our thoughts turn so readily to feelings. In sum, I assume that our affective consciousness is fully em- bodied, tied equally to our genetically dictated neuronal heritage and to the developmental interfaces with the internal world of the body as well as to the externally driven perceptual "movie in the head." My goal here is to discuss the deeply embodied nature of our emotional-affective experiences, and, consequently, I will leave to the side those higher cognitive modes of consciousness that generate HOTs. These latter depend more critically on the sensorially driven symbol-manipulating capacities of the higher neocortical reaches of our brains than our deeply experienced</page><page sequence="8">48 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp feelings about the world. But, even while computing the many differences that can be perceptually distinguished in the world, those higher brain processes remain intimately concerned with the affective processes that "bubble up" from below. On the Fundamental Nature of Affective Experience It is crucial to blend the embodied and the cognitivist views of mind, since one of the greatest remaining mysteries of the brain is the fundamental nature of affective experience. How do such gifts of nature exist in a physiochemical world? How is it that we humans and other animals experience the world in terms of a variety of forms of goodness and badness - of those many posi- tive and negative feelings that arise from our bodies interacting with the world? About such gifts, as we have noted, psychological science, especially cognitivist science, has too commonly re- mained silent. There has even been a reticence to distinguish clearly the many different types of affects that can be elaborated by the brain. As anyone who has paused to contemplate the mat- ter knows, there are many distinct types of primitive affective ex- periences - some linked to sensing the fruits and dangers of the world (e.g., the pleasure of taste and the pain of bodily injury), some related to our instinctual emotional actions in the world (e.g., anger and grief), some related to anticipation of positive and negative events (e.g., desire and dread), and some back- ground feelings related often to post-consummatory reactions, (e.g., the satisfied feelings of a good meal and the sense of relief we experience when we escape from adversity). Understanding how these feelings are actually created in the brain remains a great challenge for mind science, and brain research is essential to come to terms with such aspects of our experiences. Most agree that such feelings are instigated by our interactions with the world and are often evoked by cognitive attributions; how- ever, the deeper mystery is how the feeling states themselves are created by brain activities. The reluctance of scientists to confront such issues is easy to understand. In the arena of facts, there is little room for belief, and, at times, there seems to be little room even for theorizing, since in the present fact-driven era, many neuroscientists deem that to be mere speculation. And, of course, it does require a cer- tain degree of faith in the intelligibility of nature to try to probe</page><page sequence="9">An Archaeology of Mind 49 the evolved dynamics of the mind that cannot yet be unambigu- ously "seen" with the tools of science. Despite great advances in brain imaging (Toga and Mazziotta) , we still do not have any "mind-scopes" that can directly monitor the dynamics of con- sciousness, either in humans or other animals. However, the "weight of existing evidence" overwhelmingly affirms that affect is a natural product of brains, at the very least of mammalian and avian brains, in action. Indeed, when it comes to feelings, it is surely wise not to err in the wrong direction, for that may open doors to unethical behaviors. It would be unethical to treat ani- mals who have feelings as if they have none. It thus seems wiser to assume that other animals do experience many basic feelings, evolutionarily akin to our own, rather than to languish in a per- petual agnosticism that encourages a methodological rigor often amounting to a rigor mortis of common sense. Many behavioral scientists, prodded by scholars of more philo- sophic dispositions, are now moving beyond perpetual agnosti- cism on such issues to a point where they are willing to consider the implications of all the available evidence (Rollin). Only among those who prefer to put human consciousness on a pedes- tal or among those who compulsively over-intellectualize mental life is there still a profound denial of affective consciousness in other animals. Those still committed to atavistic Cartesian modes of thought continue to deny the depth of the bio-organic nature of psychological life. However, if those remaining skeptics are in fact right, then human consciousness is truly based on a miracle of spectacular proportions and does not reflect the evolutionary continuities that we would expect to find in the organic emer- gence of brains and minds. As unlikely as such a miraculous explanation might seem, many researchers remain unwilling to tackle first-order phenom- enology - affective and perceptual consciousness - with the tools of science. Many psychologists still prefer to conceptualize consciousness in terms of some type of "awareness of awareness" perspective (e.g., HOTs). They view raw feelings as being almost unconscious until they have been reflected in some higher thea- ter of the mind. This type of dualism promotes the "readout fal- lacy" - the assumption that, to be experienced, feeling must be read out into the higher regions of the brain - and prevents many neuroscientists from seeing how essential a confrontation</page><page sequence="10">50 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp with the basic emotional neurodynamics of the brain must be for understanding raw conscious experience. Indeed, it is possible that such an ancient form of consciousness is the necessary foun- dation for more recent, more highly resolved, forms. If all of this is true, then without brain research, especially animal brain re- search, we simply cannot obtain a satisfactory scientific under- standing of the phenomenological nature of affect. A detailed scientific understanding of these basic tools for living, evolution- arily designed to operate in and to be refined by one's interac- tions with the environment, will require abundant cross-species brain research. There is remarkably little work of this type in pre- sent day mind science. Once this work is pursued with some insti- tutional commitment, however, we will be in a better position to understand how the many other forms of human consciousness emerge in the caldron of culture. Distinctions between Affective and Cognitive Consciousness To illuminate neuroscientifically the evolved nature of the emotional apparatus, we have to bring our neuroscientific tools and conceptual arguments to bear on the ancient "limbic" brain areas, situated below our massive neocortex, areas that elaborate instinctual action urges. For many years, a reasonable working hy- pothesis has been that affective consciousness was built upon the brain systems that monitor our bodily states and those which gen- erate our instinctual emotional tendencies. Accruing evidence fi- nally allows me to offer that viewpoint as a provisional conclusion (Panksepp, 1998a). The clarification of this instinctual apparatus is not merely a matter of studying "fixed action patterns," as some have claimed, but also involves investigating the energetic states of bodily action that respond flexibly within the con- straining and guiding feedback from the environment. Damasio has also acknowledged the importance of bodily states in emotional feelings, but he has been hesitant to locate experienced affect in the lower reaches of the animalian brain, and, like most other scholars, situates it much higher in the brain (Damasio, 2003) than I do (Panksepp, 2003b). Damasio's local- ization of experienced emotional affects in neocortical regions such as the somatosensory cortex seems to postpone a confronta- tion with the many subcortical evolutionary sources of affect, and</page><page sequence="11">An Archaeology of Mind 51 it marginalizes the ancient instinctual action apparatus of our brains (Panksepp, 2003a). It also does not really pay respect to the full embodiment of mind that Spinoza tried to coax us to- ward at a philosophical level (Rawen) and that is now affirmed by so much affective neuroscience (Panksepp, 1998a). We still live in a cognition-centric era in the mind sciences, and there continues to be a perpetual neo-dualistic pressure to try to locate consciousness exclusively in the higher reaches of the human mind, even among those who claim to work on neuroscientific foundations of emotional systems (Damasio, 1994, 2003; LeDoux; Rolls). Thus, I encourage all to consider the possibility that affective feelings do not require many higher or- der thoughts. At the very least, mind/brain scientists, who typi- cally have a taste for parsimony, should consider the possibility that affect is a fundamental property of the ancient emotional action apparatus that may derive affective potency from interact- ing with ancient forms of primordial self-representation (Pank- sepp 1998a, 1998b, 2000a, 2000b). Affect may not need to be "read out" into higher mental spaces to yield raw, unfocused feel- ings, even though to generate more subtle social emotions (such as shame, guilt, jealousy, and pride), basic emotional experiences probably need to interact with the levels of second-order aware- ness that characterize cognitive consciousness. And even if raw feelings do need to be "read out" by our linguistic apparatus or other higher forms of consciousness, surely it is the input from the lower levels that remains critical for an understanding of affect. Clearly, evolution had abundant time to build a great deal of raw psychological potential and even some mental subtlety into the ancient reaches of the brain that are essential for raw affects. Thus, the parsimonious perspective advocated here could have enormous advantages in promoting our understanding. For in- stance, if affect is an embodied part of the instinctual action ap- paratus, and if its expressions are controlled by unique neuropeptidergic codes (Panksepp, 1998a), then we have the possibility of developing remarkably precise and subtle new psy- chiatric interventions to help regulate our raw emotional feel- ings, those "energetic" psychic states that facilitate learning, thinking, and behaving in various ways. Of course, if emotions were nothing but "information processing," then it would be</page><page sequence="12">52 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp most unlikely that such feeling-specific neurochemical agents could ever be discovered. However, many candidates have al- ready been discovered (Panksepp and Harro), providing yet an- other reason to believe that emotional feelings are unlikely to fit well under the cognitivist banner of information-processing. Feelings, unlike cognitions, are evolved organic "states" of the nervous system. By comparison, the rather generalized neocorti- cal brain apparatus resembles a general-purpose computational learning device that has evolved to mediate our thoughts. Affect can be an important piece of "information" in those deliberations. Five Distinctions between Emotional Consciousness and Cognitive Consciousness Let me briefly summarize, and in some cases reemphasize, the differences between the affective-emotional state functions of the brain and the more cognitive-thoughtful channel functions. These are somewhat arcane concepts, but hopefully they will be sufficiently compelling to clarify why the classic distinction be- tween thoughts and feelings may be more substantial than some scholars are presently prone to believe. State Functions vs. Channel Functions Marcel Mesulam has emphasized that some aspects of the brain operate via discrete information channels (e.g., sensory- perceptual processes) while others operate more globally to con- trol wide swaths of brain activity (e.g., the biogenic amine trans- mitters, brain-wide "spritzers" such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, as well as some neuropeptides, that regu- late neuronal arousability in global ways). This distinction can probably be used to distinguish brain processes that produce highly resolved and differentiated perceptual qualia or "felt sen- sory properties" from those aspects of awareness that are gener- ally less sensorially distinct and more holistic. The patterns elaborated by these holistic brain networks may generate an es- sential psychoneural context for perceptual consciousness and may establish a solid organic grounding for more cognitive mental activities linked to discrete information-processing chan- nels. In my estimation, this distinction is essential for making sense of affective and cognitive forms of consciousness. This does</page><page sequence="13">An Archaeology of Mind 53 not imply that these are the only forms of consciousness. As Wil- liam James notes: Our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the flimsiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life with- out suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its total- ity can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. (388) Computational vs. Non-Computational Forms of Consciousness The computational view claims that channel-functions, since they are dependent on the coding of neuronal firing patterns in anatomically delimited channels, can be instantiated using sym- bol-manipulating computational models. On the other hand, the more organically instantiated forms of affective consciousness, al- though also dependent on neuronal systems, are not computa- tional in the same sense. These systems depend on extensive networks in which the patterns of firings of individual neurons do not convey discreet information; rather, ensembles of neu- rons create certain types of holistic feelings and action tenden- cies. One might be able to simulate computationally the patterns of arousal in the "fabric" of these global systems, but we should not mistake these computations for anything more than pale shadows of real feelings. Intentions-in-Action vs. Intentions-to-Act During neural evolution, the state-control systems of the brain helped establish embodied instinctual behavioral patterns along with internally experienced affective states (Panksepp, 1998a, 1998b). These instinctual arousals constitute ancient psycho-be- havioral controls allowing fundamental forms of intentionality to emerge as an intrinsic part of the action apparatus. From these fundamental forms of intentionality, more elaborate forms of in- tentionality then developed. I believe this is what John Searle re- ferred to as the distinction between intentions-in-action and intentions-to-act. Only with a more resolved sensory-motor appara- tus, such as that which emerged with higher cortical enecephal-</page><page sequence="14">54 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp ization, can organisms operate in a virtual reality of cognitive activities and thereby select and generate more subtle behavioral choices based upon the nuances of their perceptual fields, where affects can be envisioned as tokens of information in cognitive deliberations. Action-to-Perception Processes vs. Perception-to-Action Processes This distinction is similar to the previous one. It assumes that the affective/emotional state-control systems establish action processes that also help focus perceptual fields. When an animal is angry, for example, it focuses on the source of irritation; when it is sexually aroused, it focuses on sexual cues. Only with the emergence of cognitive neural mechanisms capable of resolving highly detailed perceptual fields in reiterative ways, did the possi- bility emerge of internally buffering decision making by higher executive processes (i.e., free will?). Thus, sensorial awareness was transformed into perceptual guidance devices, permitting more deliberative actions by organisms (yielding eventually the widely recognized perception-to-action and closely related inten- tion-to-act processes). If ancient action-to-perception processes are fundamental for affective experience and primary-process in- tentionality (i.e., intentions-in-action), we may also better under- stand how neuropsychological paradoxes such as those raised by Benjamin Libet may be explained. Briefly, Libet found that neu- ral signatures of very simple intentions to act (i.e., voluntary fin- ger movements) occurred prior to the temporal perception of when those apparent decisions were actually made. Specifically, if primary process intentionality arises from the ancient motor- action apparatus, and that is still the primal contributory source of all internally generated actions, there may be a mandatory lag between an internally generated act and the perceptual coding of that act upon an external referent, such as the moving second hand of a clock. The intention-in-action process may instigate the initial brain arousal, and the resulting focusing of attentional fields may mediate the ensuing cognitive consciousness which lags in comparison to the internal source of intentionality. Neurochemical Codes vs. General Glutamatergic Computations Neuroscientists have long recognized that a distinction needs to be made between the rapidly acting neurotransmitters that di-</page><page sequence="15">An Archaeology of Mind 55 rectly generate action potentials (with glutamate being the prime example of an excitatory transmitter), and those neuromodu- latory influences which bias how effectively the rapidly acting transmitters operate (with the abundant neuropeptides being prime examples of neuromodulators that may regulate emotion- ally and motivationally specific state-variables in widely-ramifying neural networks). These different types of controls reflect the distinction between the state and channel functions of the brain, both of which may figure more heavily in affective and cognitive forms of consciousness, respectively. Many of these emotional functions may often be nearly subconscious, especially when our minds are focused on cognitive activities. Might such background affective processes contribute to the "fringe" feelings that many people report in their daily activities (Mangan)? In sum, affective states may need to be understood in terms other than those that have become second-nature in our tradi- tional information-processing types of cognitive science. Why is it so hard to moderate the grip of the information-processing com- puter metaphor in most of mind science? Perhaps it might help to remember that when the more emotional right hemisphere is damaged, the more rational/cognitive left hemisphere can ex- hibit a remarkable amount of egocentric confabulation and ra- tionalization (Feinberg; Kaplan-Solms and Solms). If I am right, many of our fellow animals, whose cognitive capacities are more modest than ours, probably feel their place in the world as in- tensely as we do. The lack of respect our western culture and behavioral scientists, past and present, have had for the other creatures of the world continues in various guises in our mind sciences. The most insidious form is the claim that we can never scientifically understand such subtle matters, and this bias pre- vents us from coming to terms with some of the most profound aspects of our human/animal nature. The Animalian Side of Human Nature All of this supports the contention that modern evolutionary psychology, with its eagerness to nail down a preconceived human nature, may have been looking for evolved mental mod- ules of the wrong types, in the wrong places (Panksepp and Pank- sepp; Panksepp et al., 2002). Most of the actual evolved systems may be those that we share with the other mammals, consisting</page><page sequence="16">56 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp largely of attentional, emotional, memorial, and motivational sys- tems situated in sub-neocortical limbic regions of the brain that constitute the foundation for our being. If nothing else, we are fundamentally mammals, with a long and glorious heritage that was capped only recently in brain evolution with a massive gen- eral-purpose "thinking cap" (the neocortex) that has, with the power of cultural evolution, permitted the emergence of the complex culture that now characterizes human life on most of the earth. One must wonder the extent to which our capacity to have higher order thoughts coaxes us to see evolutionarily specialized modules in higher reaches of our brains when, in fact, many of our cortico-cognitive abilities derive not from specialized mod- ules but from our many far from unique experiences in the world. In fact, if we were completely honest about the quality of our evidence, aside from basic sensory-perceptual and motor-ex- ecutive processes, there may be very little in our "thinking cap" that has been modularized by evolution. As of yet, the evolution- ary psychologists have not yet provided compelling evidence for the modular view of human cognitions, despite the passion and earnestness of their arguments (Pinker). What has clearly emerged in studies of brain evolution is our capacity to feel in various ways about the world. The core pas- sions of the mammalian mind are a substantial part of the foun- dation for our higher cognitive capacities - a foundation that can still permeate the rest of the mind. Unfortunately, a taxon- omy of affects is something about which brain scientists have gen- erally remained silent. Among the menagerie of affects, one of the major categories is that which we might consider the emo- tional systems - intrinsic instinctual action systems to respond to major life challenges. These are accompanied by distinct feelings of urgency. My own probing and understanding of the brain has yielded evidence that a modest number of intrinsic emotional command systems do exist in the brains of all mammals, and my results correspond quite well to those that have been generated by psychologists who study the human face or the human mind (e.g., Ekman and Davidson). This confluence is quite remarka- ble, since my own neural analysis (e.g., Panksepp, 1982, 1998a) was not based on a consideration of the evidence that had emerged from these human psychological approaches. Rather, it</page><page sequence="17">An Archaeology of Mind 57 was based on the evidence that certain emotional action patterns (fear, rage, seeking, and separation distress) could be evoked from the same subcortical regions of the brain in all mammals. Since the evidence for such basic emotional systems came from animal research, where the cognitive issues are more difficult to resolve than the affective and behavioral ones, the seven emo- tional systems that I will briefly summarize, have been labeled in capitals - CARE, FEAR, LUST, PLAY, PANIC, RAGE, and SEEK- ING (perhaps the last being a major source process for Spinoza's conatus - desire, striving). This convention of capitalizing these vernacular terms was selected to highlight the fact that I am re- ferring to necessary brain substrates for the corresponding human feelings of nurturance, angst, eroticism, joyfulness, sad- ness, anger, and desire, respectively. This helps emphasize that animal brain research can reveal the command structure of these emotional brain operating systems, while acknowledging that the interactions with the cognitive apparatus, especially of human minds, can only be understood by studying humankind. This is not to suggest that the above is an inclusive list of basic emotions, but it is one that can be rigorously and well defended on the basis of neuro-psycho-behavioral evidence with a full tri- angulation among the essential sources of evidence (i.e., the neu- ral, mental, and behavioral). Again, the animal data will tell us little about the cognitive side of the affective equation - the sec- ond-order awareness - that is associated with all the emotions, and about which so much has been written in the human litera- ture (Fridja) . As Parkinson put it, "How the path from cold non- emotional cognition to hot appraisal-drenched emotion is actu- ally negotiated is largely uncharted territory" (62). In the cogni- tive realm, the species differences are bound to be so vast that the general principles that can be derived from animal brain re- search will be more modest than those to be derived from a study of our basic emotions and motivations. Clearly, the cognitive-emotional interactions, so important for all artistic and humanistic endeavors, are best resolved through the study of human minds. My short list of basic emotional affects is, of course, not meant to suggest that there are no other affects. For instance, the pleasures and displeasures of sensation are nu- merous, but they are not appropriately placed in the emotion category, for they are not dependent on "moving out" dynami-</page><page sequence="18">58 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp cally to engage the environment in characteristically emotional ways. (For a comprehensive review of the basic emotional sys- tems, see Panksepp, 1998a.) Here I only share a modest, light- hearted introduction to the Big 7, starting with the most primi- tively social, and hence the most intriguing, of the systems: 1) How would we mammals propagate if we did not have brain systems to feel LUST for each other? Male and female sexual sys- tems are laid down early in development, while babies are still gestating, but they are not brought fully into action until pu- berty, when the maturing gonadal hormone systems begin to generate male and female sexual desires. However, because of the way the brain and body get organized, female-type desires can exist in male brains, and male-type desires can exist in fe- male brains. Of course, learning and culture persistently add lay- ers of control and complexity that cannot yet be disentangled by neuroscience. 2) How would we mammals survive if we did not have brain systems to take CARE of each other? The maternal instinct, so rich in every species of mammal (and bird too), allows us to propagate effectively. To have left this to chance, or the vagaries of individual learning, would have assured the end of our line of ascent. These hormonally governed urges, still present in humans, condition the way we respond to newborn babies - those squiggly infant lives that carry our hopes and our recom- bined packages of genes. The changing tides of peripheral es- trogen, progesterone, prolactin, and brain oxytocin figure heavily in the transformation of a virgin female brain into a fully maternal state. Because males and females have such large differ- ences in their brain and body systems, males require more emo- tional education to become fully motivated, and hence engaged, caretakers. 3) When young children get lost, they are thrown into a PANIC. They cry out for care, and their feelings of sudden alone- ness and distress may reflect the ancestral codes upon which adult sadness and grief are built. A critical brain system yields separation distress calls (crying) in all mammalian species. Brain chemistries that exacerbate feelings of distress (e.g., Cortico- trophin Releasing Factor) and those that powerfully alleviate dis- tress (e.g., brain opioids, oxytocin, and prolactin) are the ones that figure heavily in the genesis of social attachments and proba-</page><page sequence="19">An Archaeology of Mind 59 bly ameliorate depression. These are the chemistries that can as- sist or defeat us in our desire to create inter-subjective spaces with others, spaces where we can learn the emotional ways of our kind. Many social chemistries remain to be found, but when they are, we will eventually have new ways to help those whose social emotional "energies" are more or less than they desire. This knowledge may also link up with a better understanding of child- hood disorders such as autism, since some children with this con- dition may be socially aloof, in part, because they are excessively addicted to their own self-released opioids as opposed to those activated by significant others. 4) Young animals PLAY with each other in order to navigate social possibilities in joyous ways. The urge to play was also not left to chance by evolution, but is built into the instinctual action apparatus of the mammalian brain. We know less about this emo- tional system than any other, partly because so few are willing to recognize that such gifts could be derived as much from mother nature as our kindest nurture. It is even harder to conceive that such systems can even promote a joyous "laughter" in other spe- cies (Panksepp and Burgdorf). But these are "experience expec- tant" systems that bring young animals to the perimeter of their social-knowledge, to psychic places where they must pause to contemplate what they can or cannot do to others. Human chil- dren who are not allowed safe places to exercise their ludic ener- gies - these urges for rough-and-tumble engagement - may express such ancient urges in situations where they should not. If they are too impulsive within the classroom, they increase the likelihood that they will be labeled troublemakers (e.g., diag- nosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) who "should" be quieted with anti-play drugs - psychostimulants such as Ritalin. Some of us entertain the idea that many of these kids, especially when they are very young, would find better bene- fits from extra rations of rough-and-tumble activities each and every day. It seems likely that this type of social activity can pro- gram brain circuits essential for well-modulated social abilities, perhaps partly by activating many genes that promote neuronal growth and health. As Plato said in the Republic, "Our children from their earliest years must take part in all the more lawful forms of play, for if they are not surrounded with such an atmos-</page><page sequence="20">60 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp phere they can never grow up to be well conducted and virtuous citizens" (424e). 5) Our world has abundant dangers, many of which we need to learn about, and others of which we intrinsically FEAR. Although the stimuli that provoke our intrinsic fearfulness may be differ- ent, the core structure of the aroused FEAR system may be very similar across all mammalian species. For instance, we humans do not enjoy either unprotected heights or strange dark places. In both situations, our minds are captivated by fear. Rats, on the other hand, enjoy darkness more than light, but they become timid in the presence of samples of cat fur so small that we can hardly detect them. This is even true of lab-reared rats that have never met a threatening cat in their lives. Neuroscientists have unraveled the details of the brain circuitry that mediate some of the fears, but they have tended to focus on information that en- ters the FEAR system via so called "high-road" (more cognitive- perceptual inputs), and via "low-roads" (the more primitive sen- sory inputs), while often ignoring the "Royal Road," the evolved FEAR system, which governs the instinctual action apparatus that intrinsically help animals avoid danger. There are probably sev- eral distinct fear systems in the brain, but we are barely begin- ning to learn how to distinguish one from another. 6) Fear is commonly evoked by the RAGE of other, bigger and stronger, animals. This anger system can be aroused by restraint and frustration. If we do not get what we want, it is likely that there will be more activity in our RAGE system than there would be otherwise. Of course, adults can modulate their anger in ways that children and animals cannot. Just like every subcortical emo- tional system, higher cortico-cognitive abilities are able to pro- vide inhibition, guidance, and other forms of emotional regulation. We presently have no psychotropic medications that can specifically control pathological anger, but the neuroscien- tific analysis of RAGE circuitry may eventually yield such tools for emotional self-regulation. 7) A remarkable system that has been revealed by brain re- search is that which mediates the appetitive desire to find and harvest the fruits of the world. I call this desire system the SEEK- ING system (as noted earlier, perhaps this is the major founda- tional substrate for Spinoza's concept of conatus). Animals "love" to self-activate, to self-stimulate, this system in addictive ways, as</page><page sequence="21">An Archaeology of Mind 61 the example of animal and human drug addiction illustrates. For three decades, I have been seeking to convince the neuroscien- tific community that this system should be acknowledged as a ba- sic, positively motivated action system that helps mediate our desires and our positive expectancies about the world (the most recent effort being in Panksepp and Moskal). This, rather than the behavioristic concept of "reinforcement," accounts for such behavior. In any event, this system highlights the massive degree to which a basic state control system that mediates the primary- process phenomenology of appetitive actions can readily link up with cognitive systems that mediate secondary-process awareness and appraisals. This system operates in both positive and nega- tive emotional situations (e.g., seeking safety) and helps maintain a fluidity in our behavior as well as our cognitive apparatus (Ikemoto and Panksepp). More on Those All Pervasive Cognitive- Emotion Interactions Since emotional states are so effective in channeling percep- tual and cognitive processes, an increasing number of investiga- tors seem eager to conflate cognitive and affective processes during the current "emotion revolution" that is captivating cog- nitive science (e.g., Lane and Nadel). Although it is essential to understand eventually how emotional and cognitive processes in- teract at the neuronal level, I suspect that little deep understand- ing of these neural interactions can be achieved until we better understand the basic core emotions. The modern attempts to see both affect and thought as two sides of the same cognitive-infor- mational coin only hinders a solid scientific confrontation with the essential component of this equation - the fundamental na- ture of affect. It is possible that the many socially constructed emotions rely on the more basic ones for their affective impact. Hence, it is likely that our understanding of such emotions as abhorrence, contempt, empathy, loathing, scorn, smugness, even disgust, guilt, and shame, may be socially constructed emotions that must await our understanding of the more basic ones for any neuroscientific understanding. The fact that most everyday cognitions are deeply embedded in affective structures (yielding an abundance of socially con- structed emotions) should not lead us to neglect the even deeper</page><page sequence="22">62 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp evolutionary nature of affective experience. For instance, human infants come into the world as profoundly affective creatures. Their initial cognitive limitations are erased gradually by exper- iences in loving inter-subjective spaces where they can be potent actors on the world stage that now opens to them. Their first explorations are not devoted to the inanimate world, but to the eyes, the voice, the touch of the caregiver - who is hopefully a mother whose brain affective systems have been well prepared not only by culture but the loving touch of neurochemical sys- tems that can make engagement with an infant a special delight. It is the rich inter-subjective dance of mother and child from which future possibilities are woven, in both humans (Trevarthen) and other mammals (Meaney). To believe human infants, in their first engagements with life, are unconscious packages of reflexes as opposed to affectively engaged human be- ings is an intellectual travesty that is the residue of the sad ongo- ing history of the behavioral sciences (Rollin). Guided by such mistaken notions, "experts" encourage parents to allow their chil- dren to cry themselves to sleep and to keep aloof when a child wants to be held and hugged. It is of utmost importance for our society to promote a new and deeper level of emotional education - an affective intelli- gence that can prevent the sin of the parents from being passed on to children in cycles of child abuse that are commonly mental rather than physical. Every emotional system that has been stud- ied exhibits use-dependent plasticity. This means that if one has been exposed to too many horrible experiences, then the brain systems that mediate the resulting feelings will have been strengthened. Infants who have lived at the center of care-givers' positive emotional engagements, and who have been offered manageable life challenges with which they become engaged, have been given a precious gift of life. Such effects are even evi- dent in laboratory rats (Meaney). When we begin to understand how the solidification of emotional habits occurs at the neuronal level, which is much deeper than simple learning of phobias, then we may also learn how to disentangle, in part, the damage that has been wrought by emotional misfortunes (Panksepp, 2001c). We remain very far from such knowledge at the present time, largely because of a lack of will in our culture to pursue such questions in our fellow animals. Without emotionally in-</page><page sequence="23">An Archaeology of Mind 63 formed animal brain research, hopefully done with a greater inter-species sensitivity than is common in either science or our culture, that kind of knowledge can never be ours. Development of New Medications Once we understand the neurochemical details of the various core emotional systems, we will have the basic knowledge needed to think about how we might best seek to alleviate the affective burdens of people in emotional distress. Many mind scientists have yet to come to terms with the deep neuro-evolutionary na- ture of our emotional lives, but we can finally be certain than many of our passions and our hungers and all variety of delights and agonies of the soul (which I assume is a neurobiological pro- cess yet to be studied) have chemical codes. Some of the chemi- cal messengers cut across many species of feelings, while others are rather unique to one or another motivation. Many of these carriers of the affective life will be molecules of the neuropeptide class (short protein sequences) which can con- trol neuronal system sensitivities and responsivities for extended periods of time. Not only does this help explain why many feel- ings linger, but it also provides new ways to think about how we might coax them to linger in different ways. I will not explore these possibilities here. They are well covered elsewhere (Pank- sepp, 1993, 1998, 2004; Panksepp and Harro). I will only reaffirm my belief that the subtle mind medicines that we can create from this knowledge will be best used with a new empathy for those who need such help. Many of these molecules will work best when combined with sensitive psychological care offered in envi- ronments that support the ability of people to see their lives from different affective perspectives. In this vision, people with deep emotional needs and disturbances will have to be full partici- pants in professional attempts to restore affective balance. They should not just be given pills and sent on their way. The battle over whether psychological or biological therapies are better for psychiatric disturbances should now be over. Mod- ern brain imaging has demonstrated, time and again, that psy- chotherapy has demonstrable and beneficial effects on the brain. This is creating a sea-change in our conception of who we are and what we are seeking to accomplish in therapeutic interven-</page><page sequence="24">64 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp tions. Dan Siegel said it well in the Foreword to Louis Cozolino's penetrating book on that topic: Clinicians immerse themselves in the stories of individuals who come for help in feeling better .... Whatever the approach, lasting change in therapy occurs as a result of changes in the human mind . . . which involve changes in the functions of the brain. Exactly how the mind changes during the therapeutic process is the fundamental puzzle that the synthe- sis of neuroscience and psychotherapy seeks to solve. In Sum Hopefully, our culture will eventually understand the founda- tion of human and animal nature and recognize that we are in- heritors of core emotional-affective systems that are remarkably similar to those of other mammals. If that is achieved without marginalizing the best of our cultural achievements, it can bene- fit each local culture and, therefore, the human race. There is a primitive affective awareness built into the infrastructure of our brains that is the birthright of every mammal and bird, and per- haps of some other animals as well. Considering the fact that emotional feelings are so important in guiding cognitive and so- cial decision making (Adolphs, Tranel, and Damasio; Damasio, 1994), we must certainly wonder whether rationality has been oversold as the major source of human actions. The claim that our lower sub-neocortical regions of the brain may have a consciousness of its own has not been well received by the neuroscience community. Most scholars of emotions are still committed to the view that affective feelings, to be experienced, need to be "read out" into the higher regions of the brain. Some would place the readout in the somatosensory regions of the neo- cortex (Damasio, 1994, 2003). Some would place the "readout" in the working memory regions of the dorsolateral frontal cortex (LeDoux) . Yet others suggest that all forms of consciousness are critically dependent on our linguistic abilities and hence cen- tered mostly in the language regions of our left hemispheres (Rolls). How this magical "readout" might occur has not been clarified by anyone. I personally do not believe it exists, even though those higher areas are very important in regulating emo- tions by generating attributions, repression, and denials that feed into the basic emotional systems. In my estimation, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that the sub-neocortical regions have the</page><page sequence="25">An Archaeology of Mind 65 neural sophistication to construct that critical aspect of our mental lives, the part that we share with many other animals, raw affective experience. The areas which are critical for this achieve- ment may be very deep and ancient brainstem structures such as the Periaqueductal Gray, and surrounding neural systems, which help elaborate a core SELF (Damasio, 1999; Panksepp, 1998a, 1998b, 2000a, 2000b). None of us really needs higher order thoughts to achieve a coarse affective level of awareness (pain is an excellent example), even though our cognitive apparatus is remarkably important in resolving our affective life into all manner of subtle nuances. Crucial as cognitive attributions are for our mental lives, the en- ergetic engines to achieve the intensity of felt experience reside deep in our animalian brains where thoughts are of the simplest varieties. Infants emerge into cognitive spaces by gauging how their feelings relate to the world into which they were born. They seek out situations which support their positive feelings, and they avoid those which create negative ones. The gradually develop- ing cognitive apparatus adds an enormous amount to our cul- tural lives, but without our inborn, fully embodied, neuronally energized capacity to feel good and bad about the world, we would be zombies. One of the greatest remaining scientific challenges of our times is the fuller clarification of the evolved nature of the brain mechanisms that are the direct carriers of such ancestral gifts. For perplexing historical reasons (Rollin), these questions are not yet being pursued with the institutional conviction that they deserve. Partly, this is because the more cognitive ability we scien- tists possess, the more skeptical we often tend to be about the emotional side of life. This may be because as we mature, the raw emotional aspects of our lives have come under the powerful in- hibitory, and often repressive, control of our "thinking caps" - our massive cortical apparatus. We only feel intensely during times when this cortical control diminishes, as in playfulness and sadness, when the primitive ancient forces of our lives surface through our ruling cognitive apparatus (Liotti and Panksepp). I have not heard it better said than this: There lies behind every thing, and you can believe this or not as you wish, a certain quality which we may call grief. It's always there, just under the surface, just behind the façade, sometimes very</page><page sequence="26">66 SOUNDINGS Jaak Panksepp nearly exposed, so you can dimly see the shape of it as you can see sometimes through the surface of an ornamental pond on a still day, the dark, gross, inhuman outline of a carp gliding slowly past; when you realize suddenly that the carp were always there below the surface, even while the water sparkled in the sunshine, and while you patronized the quaint ducks and the supercilious swans, the carp were down there, unseen. It bides its time, this quality. And if you do catch a glimpse of it, you may pretend not to notice or you may turn suddenly away and romp with your children on the grass, laughing for no good reason. The name of this quality is grief. - James Saunders, Next Time I'll Sing for You The aim of affective neuroscience is to come to terms with these ancient "carp" of our mental existence. This is not in- tended to marginalize the importance of the neocortex for the more highly resolved perceptual and other cognitive contents of our mental apparatus. This also does not diminish the many im- portant differences that each species of animal and each human culture brings to the rich banquet of mental life that exists in this world of ours. The cortex is a neuronal-cultural "playground" where the more ancient gifts and curses of our animal nature can be molded into the many subtle feelings that are distinctly human.
