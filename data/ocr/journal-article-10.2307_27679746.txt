<plain_text><page sequence="1">Survey of Periodicals: Indissolubility of Marriage Seamus Ryan In two previous articles I tried to analyze some recent writing on the New Testament, the teaching of the Fathers and the divergent traditions of the Eastern and Western Churches. The present article attempts to give an account of some of the more-important issues raised in the Catholic discussion of divorce and re-marriage today, and to map out the general direction in which theological reflection on these matters seems to be moving. The debate centres for the most part around three subjects : (1) The power of the Church to dissolve marriages. (2) When is a marriage truly a 'sacrament'? When is it truly 'consummated'? (3) The case for admitting some divorced and re-married to the sacraments. Ladislas Orsy, sj., the noted American canonist, said recently that the effort of historians and theologians in investigating the indissolubility of marriage or the possibility of divorce could well be misdirected. The main effort, he says, should be in investigating positively what a Christian marriage is. This, of course, is central to all the debate, and it is perhaps well to begin with a few observations here. MARRIAGE - CONTRACT OR COVENANT? We have already commented on the considerable unanimity among New Testament scholars that Jesus affirmed absolutely and un conditionally the indissolubility of marriage. But it still remains true as E. Schillebeeckx has pointed out in his celebrated book on marriage (Marriage: Secular Reality and Saving Mystery, London 1965) that S?amus Ryan teaches theology in St Patrick's College, Thurles, Co. Tipperary.</page><page sequence="2">SURVEY OF PERIODICALS 273 Christ did not tell us where the element that constitutes marriage was situated, what in fact made a marriage a marriage, what made it the reality which he called absolutely indissoluble. Generally it is to consent that we have given the greatest impor tance in the making of a marriage, and yet it is recognized that the expression of consent in marriage is a highly-formalized juridical moment and must by no means be identified with the rich existential totality that marriage is. Generally authors today are fairly unani mous in their conviction that the contractual approach to marriage favoured by Canon Law was a real barrier to theological progress in the understanding of marriage.1 The essential object of marriage consent according to the Code of Canon Law is 'the permanent and exclusive right to the body (ius in corpus), with a view to those acts which are of themselves fitting for procreation' (Canon 1081, 2). It is no\V recognized that this is a 'totally unsatisfactory and impoverished concept of the object of consent'.2 The whole object of the contract is presented as a right to a thing (corpus). A con tract deals with things, but marriage deals with people, and thus it is significant that Vatican II in its extensive treatment of mar riage in Gaudium et Spes does not mention the word contract at all but favours the more biblical and theological word covenant. The Fathers in fact did not discuss marriage in the traditional terminology of primary and secondary ends; they speak of mar riage as a covenant of love and fidelity. In a paper delivered at an International Colloquium on Marriage and Divorce in Louvain in 1971 M. de W?chter discussed the important place given to con jugal love in marriage by Gaudium et Spes? He traces a devel opment through the various preparatory drafts up to the final version. From a preliminary juridical stance in which conjugal love is only a secondary concern, there is a gradual development in the drafts towards emphasis on the vital importance of love in the very definition of marriage itself. 1.

The canonists are slow to declare that love pertains to the very essence of marriage, largely because love is the kind of imponderable whose presence or absence would be very difficult to assess in the external tribunal. Clearly under any su?h hypothesis room would have to be left for degrees of love, a certain minimum being sufficient to constitute a marriage. The question is sometimes asked in this context about the cultures where arranged marriages are common, and where bride and groom may meet for the first time at the altar. Father P. F. Palmer, a noted American scholar in all areas of the theology of marriage, has this to say : Even when love is not yet present, we can speak of a right to love, of an openness to love, of a promise to love and cherish, of the right to one another's undivided affection . .. Any definition of marriage, whether it be in terms of contract or covenant, must include the right to love, the promise to love, the pledge of one's undivided affection. Where such a pledge is not made with sincerity .. . there is, in my judgment, no covenant, no sacrament, no title t? Christ's grace which per fects natural love, no marriage.4 He Can cite in his support several texts from Gaudium et Spes which envisage marriage as 'an intimate partnership of life and love established by the creator ... rooted in the conjugal covenant of irrevocable personal consent' (48). This and similar statements have in recent years been acknowledged a juridical status in certain decisions of the Roman Rota. In a Rotal decision of 30 October 1970 the following legal procedure was cited: Where conjugal love is lacking, either the consent is not free, or it is not internal, or it excludes or limits the object which must be integral to have a valid marriage. The section of the Rotal decision which determines legal procedure finally concludes by appealing to the very passage of Gaudium et Spes cited above : Now after the Council it is clear that, because of the lack of true conjugal love, the object of the contract is missing .. . because the mutual self-giving in marriage, by which marriage is constituted, was missing in the act of celebrating the marriage. 4. Paul F. Palmer, art. cit., p. 646.</page><page sequence="4">SURVEY OF PERIODICALS 275 The decision itself echoes the same line of thought : As a result, lack of conjugal love is the same as lack of consent. Conjugal love has juridical force here, because the defendant despised the total communion of life which prim arily and of itself constitutes the object of the marriage's contract.5 At a time when the Church is groping for a theology of marriage along the guidelines provided by the Council, it is inevitable that the conclusions and proposals of the theologian are at best tenta tive. He is feeling his way over unfamiliar terrain and this is clearly reflected in most of the contemporary literature in this field. THE PAPAL POWER TO DISSOLVE MARRIAGE It will help to get the current debate in context if we bear in mind the considerable development which has marked the doctrine and practice of the Roman Catholic Church over the centuries on the question of indissolubility of marriage. What stands out clearly is the progressive realization by the Church of the powers she posses ses over the bond of marriage. The Pauline Privilege (allegedly based on 1 Cor. 7:15) was first clearly recognized by Hincmar of Rheims in the ninth century, and universally accepted only in the late middle ages. In more recent years the Petrine Privilege has been widely used, viz. the power of the Pope to dissolve the valid and consummated marriages of unbaptized persons in favorem fidei. A number of decisions of Pius XII make it clear that the Pope claims also the power to dissolve a marriage between a Catholic and an unbaptized person at the request of either party. A cele brated case was the dissolution by the Pope of a valid Moslem marriage in 1957 in order to permit one of the parties to enter a valid Catholic marriage. This would entail that potentially the great bulk of marriages in the world, viz. those in which at least one party is unbaptized, are open to papal dissolution.^ In addi tion to this ever since the fifteenth century the popes have under taken to dissolve marriages which are true valid sacramental unions effected by the exchange of marital consent, but not consummated by intercourse. John Noonan, author of the recently-published and already celebrated Power to Dissolve, argues that the papal practice of 5. Excerpts from Rotal deuisions are quoted by Palmer, art. cit., p. 647. 6. lohn Noonan points out the anomaly that the Pope seemed to possess more power over the marriages of those outside the Church than of those within it {Power to Dissolve, 1972, p. 393).</page><page sequence="5">276 THE FURROW dissolving marriages has dealt a death-blow to the once widely held Catholic belief that natural law required marriage to be indissoluble : Looking at present papal practice it is evident that the scrip ture teaching 'What God has joined together, let no man put asunder' is not taken literally or absolutely by the Roman Curia. By the same token it appears that the natural indissolu bility of marriage ... so little regarded by the classic Canon Law and some of the greatest commentators, and so recently asserted in polemic is no longer the basis of papal action.7 He goes on to raise the question : What is the basis for the papal practice of dissolving such marriages? Theologians have tradition ally said that Christ in conferring on St Peter 'the power of the keys' (Mat. 16:19) granted the Roman Pontiff the authority to loose or dissolve all marriages with the sole exception of a consummated Christian marriage - matrimonium ratum et consummatum. The Pope acts therefore in virtue of a vicarious divine power, a power which civil authority does not wield because it is wholly human. As Pius XII expressed it in an address to the Roman Rota in 1943, it is not a question of man separating what God has joined, for the Pope is acting in the name of God. Put starkly in this way it seems incredible to many theologians to speak so readily of a divinely-delegated power without scrip tural warrant, indeed, if anything, against the evidence of the scrip tures. The exegetes would have grave reservations with this inter pretation of Matthew 16:9; more imporatnt is that the Church cannot lightly lay claim to special privileges or powers in such matters beyond whatever knowledge or responsibility is given to her in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Some theologians would go so far as to contend that Christ's admonition - 'What God has joined together, let no man put asunder' - applies to all human auth ority, civil and ecclesiastical, and are not at all happy with the idea of the Church dissolving non-Christian marriages with what is too readily claimed to be vicariously divine authority.8 Louis de 7. John T. Noonan, Tndissolubility of Marriage and Natural Law', Theology Digest 19 (1971), 1, p. 15. 8. That the Church may be having second thoughts on the matter is perhaps indicated by a severe limitation on the use of the Petrine Privilege intro duced in 1970 (Canon Law Society of America, Newsletter, April 1971). According to Noonan Cardinal Seper, the new head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, was puzzled by the implications of the power claimed for the Pope, and wanted it subjected to thorough examination {Power to Dissolve, p. 392 and p. 461).</page><page sequence="6">SURVEY OF PERIODICALS 277 Naurois, s.J., finds the notion of delegation of divine power to the Pope embarrassingly anthropomorphic. It seems to reduce God to the stature and style of a sovereign of the middle ages granting to some favoured citizen the privilege of being dispensed from his own laws.9 The facit, ergo potest argument which is often applied in such matters (the Church does it, therefore she can do it) is one which is treated with a considerable measure of caution by theologians these days. Richard A. McCormick, s.J., whose regular feature in Theological Studies - 'Notes on Moral Theology' - has been an invaluable service to students of theology over these past years and to whom I am deeply indebted for material in this article, has this to say. There is the distinct possibility that the Church should really dissolve no marriages at all, that she erred pastorally in the past in doing so and should cease and desist in the future. We cannot reject this out of hand. The facit, ergo potest analysis is a deeply-juridical approach to a question which extends far beyond juridical considerations. Furthermore, it is a juridical analysis which built heavily on a theory of divinely-delegated power, a theory under heavy theological assault these days ... It just might be that the Church should look elsewhere (than in the dissolution of the bond) for pastoral solutions to marriage problems ... A refusal to dissolve any true marital bond is not the same as refusing to accept and forgive those who have found it impossible to live the demands of this bond. The same author writing two years ago and reflecting on the con temporary Catholic literature on divorce and re-marriage had this pertinent comment to make : If one were to try to summarize the direction of contemporary Catholic writing on divorce, I believe it would not be inac curate to say that two threads of thought are constantly present: (1) the absolute indissolubility as taught by Jesus; (2) the nearly universal admission in recent writings that certain unions ratum et consummatum in traditional terms never reach the truly Christian notion of marriage and hence 9.

This literature is young and groping, depending as it often does on Vatican ITs recovery of a more integral notion of marriage. Yet it is enormously important, not just in itself, but for our pastoral approach to the divorced and re-married.11 His brief summary of the direction of Catholic writing at the present time is extraordinarily good and suggests two further section headings under which it is possible to group a number of important developments in contemporary Catholic reflection which still remain to be documented. A CONSUMMATED SACRAMENTAL MARRIAGE IS INDISSOLUBLE In spite of an increase in the number of studies in recent years which claim for the Church the power to dissolve a consummated Christian marriage, I think I would agree with William Bassett, who, after a careful examination of all such literature, comes to the conclusion that 'recent studies have not proven this possi bility'.12 A careful distinction must be made between such studies and a very different line of approach which does not claim this power for the Church but which calls for a revision of the notion of both 'sacrament' and 'consummation', and to this we will return presently. A good example of the first line of approach is provided by J. Gerhartz.13 His contribution has the positive value of making quite clear that theologians have not succeeded in showing persuasively why a matrimonium ratum et consummatum should be absolutely indissoluble. This is a recurring point throughout all the literature - that the theologians have not really elaborated a theology of marriage to meet the needs and the questions of the present times. Raymond Goedert, the president of the Canon Law Society of America feels that the canonists have been bearing the brunt of a criticism which should really be directed at the theologians: 'We are being criticized because of poor law. But law can only follow good theology. My quarrel is that theologians have not done their homework on what constitutes a sacramental marriage.' 11. Id., Theological Studies 32 (1971), 1, p. 113. 12.

J. Ratzinger says that it would be highly irresponsible for a theologian to suggest that the Church could change her position on this.14 The ultimate reason is that marriage between Christians reflects God's covenant with the Church and is conceived as parti cipating in the indissolubility of this latter union. It should be noted, however, that Ratzinger would favour a broader and deeper concept of consummation than that traditionally advanced.1^ K. Reinhardt emerges as the champion of orthodoxy in this matter.16 His contribution has the merit of analyzing what is meant by the 'bond of marriage'. He recalls the teaching of St Augustine who makes a close comparison between the indissoluble marriage bond and the irremovable character conferred in baptism and ordination. In all three sacraments Christ lays hold on people for a particular task in the Church. If a baptized person later publicly opts out of the Church, he concludes his visible and legally tangible association with her, but it would be a mistake to think that the link forged at baptism is now as though it had never been. There is a sense in which the baptized is still answerable and accountable to Christ and to the Church because there is not question here merely of a human obligation which he can cast off at will, but of an abiding accountability to God who acts in the sacraments forging a link between God and man which man may choose to ignore or reject but which he can never completely nullify. Something of the same is true of the marriage bond especially when sanctioned and confirmed by the Churchs' sacrament. The bond is not something that mysteriously comes into existence in some magical way independent of the will and consent of the partners. What it does mean is henceforth they are permanently oriented towards each other - responsible for and accountable to each other all their days because God has been in a special way the witness and guarantor of the partnership of life and love they have pledged to each other. Father McCormick makes a telling point against those who advocate the possibility of remarriage even after a matrimor?um ratum et consummatum. The first marriage being a true Christian 14. J.

Reinhardt, 'Die Unaufloslichkeit der sakramentalen Ehe', Theologie der Gegenwart 15 (1972), 4, pp. 210-16.</page><page sequence="9">280 THE FURROW marriage was a symbol of Christ's union with his Church. Now if the second marriage is truly a marriage it must also be a symbol of this union, and this is precisely what its proponents claim for it, though admittedly on a somewhat less perfect level. Yet, if this were so, there would be no reason why a third or fourth union could not also do the same. But to claim this would be to make a mockery out of Christ's fidelity to his Church. It would be robbed of all its meaning, if a whole succession of love relationships could be thought to symbolize it.17 WHEN IS MARRIAGE 'SACRAMENTAL' AND 'CONSUMMATED'? It could not be claimed then that recent studies have made any notable inroads on the traditional belief that a consummated sacramental marriage - and it alone - is absolutely indissoluble. It would, however, be totally wide of the mark to therefore draw the conclusion that there had been no significant development in this area. In fact what could well prove to be the most significant development in the whole question of divorce and remarriage is taking place precisely here - in the endeavour to rethink and re formulate more adequately what sacramentality and consummation mean in this context. The question of the sacramentality of marriage is one which has exercised the wits of theologians and canonists for many a century. The statement of the Code of Canon Law that the valid marriage of two baptized partners is automatically a sacrament poses certain problems for the theologian who probably has a built-in resistance to the idea of any sacrament 'automatically' happening or coming into being. An extreme case will show that the principle enuntiated in Canon 1012 no. 2 is not without certain difficulties. A Catholic and a pagan are married, and later separate; if the pagan subse quently receives baptism does the marriage become sacramental automatically even though the pair are long separated? A more likely case: many Protestants do not believe that marriage is a sacrament, and may not have even conceived of the idea. Do two such partners nevertheless contract a sacramental marriage just because they happen to be baptized? Not all theologians would agree, and quite a number have been suggesting that more careful consideration must be given to the whole question of personal faith before any final decision can be reached on whether a particular union is truly a sacrament. 17. R. A. McCormick, art. cit., Theological Studies 32 (1971) 1. p. 120.</page><page sequence="10">SURVEY OF PERIODICALS 281 P. F. Palmer, s.J., proposes that baptism alone is not enough basis, but that bride and groom have to be believers at the time of their marriage.18 He would deny that every marriage between Christians is a Christian marriage. If faith is required of an adult for the valid reception of a sacrament, it seems to follow that a baptized Christian who no longer believed in God, in Christ or the Church could not receive the sacrament of matrimony. Palmer is writing particularly with the American situation in mind where many young couples, particularly college graduates, go through the formality of a 'church wedding' with really no faith at all. They may have some faith in God, but this faith could scarcely be called Christian. It is therefore highly questionable, he argues, whether such marriages can be regarded as truly sacramental and hence absolutely indissoluble. Some theologians favour Schillebeeckx's suggestion of 'degrees of sacramentality' in marriage and argue that this could have an important bearing on the question of indissolubility. The cele brated Protestant theologian of the monastery of Taiz?, Max Thurian, says that the Church sometimes gives its blessing far too readily to marriages whose indissolubility is not sufficiently assured by the quality and maturity of the Christian faith of those being joined together, i 9 What may be little more in fact than a 'trial marriage' cannot become a sacrament and a symbol of Christ's unity with the Church simply by being celebrated in church. We must not lightly suppose without any further qualification that baptized Christians who marry, regardless of the quality of their personal faith, confer and receive the sacrament of marriage. More important perhaps is the growing conviction among theo logians that the traditional notion of consummation is too narrowly physical and needs to be profoundly modified if it is to be recon ciled with the teaching of the Council on marriage. It would be possible to quote a whole host of theologians in support of this thesis, but there has been a critical reaction in some quarters too. It was Alexander III (+1181) who finally determined the doc trine that sexual intercourse effected 'consummation' and rendered Christian marriage indissoluble. He thus brought to an end the long controversy between the theologians (the school of Paris) and the canonists (the school of Bologna) concerning the source or radix 18. P. F. Palmer, art. cit., pp. 641-43; id., 'Rethinking the Marriage Bond', America (17 January 1970), p. 39. 19. M. THURiAN, Mariage et C?libat (1964), p. 23.</page><page sequence="11">282 THE FURROW of the marriage bond. Gratian, representing the canonists main tained that marriage was fully realized only when sexual union had taken place. Peter Lombard on the other hand, representing the theologians, held that marriage was complete and indissoluble once consent was exchanged. Alexander III provided the authori tative synthesis by insisting that the bond was intimately linked to both consent and sexual union; once consent was exchanged the partners were truly man and wife, but their union could not be considered absolutely indissoluble until sealed and ratified by the first marital act. Alexander thus brought into being a new juridical category of 'consummated marriage' - consummation being iden tified with the first marital union of the spouses. From the point of view of the canonist sexual intercourse was an attractive criterion of indissolubility, because it was legally prov able in a way that some of the more imponderable spiritual values of marriage might not be. On the other hand it is a criterion which does overlook certain dimensions of the notion of consummation which a number of theologians are now anxious to erstore. It was the Church's concentration on the exchange of consent and the first sexual act that provided justification for Karl Barth's observation that Christian tradition had not succeeded in producing a theology of marriage but only a theology of the wedding ceremony and of the first night. Recent writing on this question shows a remarkably widespread concern that the notion of consummation be rescued from the narrowly physical context into which it has been closetted. It must be given a richer content embracing the whole profound process by which two people become one flesh. The main argument in favour of this broadening of the concept of consummation is drawn from the deeply mysterious nature of marriage as a symbol of the unity of Christ and his Church. Traditionally the whole basis of the indissolubility of a Christian marriage has been found in this symbolism. But it is difficult to see how the sign-value of this relationship could be adequately realized in a single act of sex which in an individual case might not be a loving act at all. R. W. Catterall says that we are not justified in singling out one particular act - the first act of intercourse - and saying: 'Now your marriage reflects the mystery of the union of Christ and his Church, and is in consequence absolutely indissoluble.'20 The 20.

Clergy Review (November 1967), p. 890.</page><page sequence="12">SURVEY OF PERIODICALS 283 biblical concept of becoming two in one flesh cannot be limited to a single biological act, but is a much richer notion embracing all the various relationships that come into play in the intimate union of man and wife. The case for a broader concept of consummation, though neces sarily including sexual intercourse, has been well put by Theodore Mackin, s.J. : It will always be true that sexual intercourse will be the specific element in the consummation of sacramental marri ages. The intimate compenetration of bodies that is meant in some way to enrich life is marriage's specific communication. But this by itself is not enough. It is possible for this compene tration, even among Christian spouses, to be not a signing forth of God's redeeming presence. Any spouse reflecting on the history of his own marriage knows this is true. That a single act of intercourse of a Christian husband and wife could consummate marriage as a sacrament seems impos sible. What is possible is that one such experience could be for them alone an unambiguous sign of each one's partici pation in Christ's loving self-giving - a participation in a measure yet to be found out. This much is possible where thoroughly aware and instructed men and women of deepest faith and trust marry after many months of searching and testing courtship. But it is severely doubtful that many marri ages of Christians begin in this clarity and strength; it is clear that many never attain it.21 The exponents of this broader concept are only too well aware of the far-reaching consequences which it would imply in the matter of assessing the indissolubility of certain marriages. It bristles with problems for the canonist not least of which would be the difficulty of translating this broader concept into juridical terms. Yet in spite of the inevitable difficulties it may bring and the serious conse quences it may entail for the Church's present discipline, these considerations are not the deciding factor. The crucial question is whether this recent approach more truly respects the complex reality of Christian marriage, and more truly reflects the way in which very many contemporary couples assess the stability and likely permanence of their marriages. If consummation is to be more than just a legal category, if it is to truly express a human reality, then its juridical meaning must be more closely related to, 21. T. Mackin, s.J., art. cit.

Canonical clarity cannot have the last word.22 Canonical discipline has become divorced from life where the permanence or impermanence of a marriage can be decided by the private examination of a gynaecologist. Another article will be necessary to see how theologians and canonists see the challenge which this re-thinking of consummation poses for the Church's canonical discipline. In this same conte?t it will be also possible to review the considerable body of literature which has grown up in recent years on the pastoral care of the divorced who have in fact re-married. 22. R.
