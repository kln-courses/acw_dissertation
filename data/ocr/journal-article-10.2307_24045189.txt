Similarly, many of Wordsworth's come objects when they are owned. In the anatomized, frag- stones, trees, flowers, are just objects: the stones in mented, synecdochic world of Romanticism, Wordsworth, for "Michael," the meanest flower, the broken wooden bowl, the example, can talk about "the Mighty World of Eye and Ear," yew tree, the rainbow, memory chips that set off strains of or Keats, "this living hand," lovers cut and exchange locks of thought and poetry but themselves remain inert, dispos hair and write poems about them, or a heart, as Pascoe notes, sessed, existing whether one perceives or uses them or not. such as Shelley's, was saved in Mary's desk drawer until it turned to dust.

Besides the objects that were manufactured, were found or purchased: example, Lamb's Old China. So purchased, and collected during the great age of collecting, in another example of how literature anticipates social from early in the 18th century, creative and skillful individu thought, Mark Kwint, in the Introduction to Material Memo- als in all fields were generating instruments and with them, ries (1999), says, "human memory has undergone a mutual or before them, the concept of instrumentality.

Wordsworth knew that, and so did Blake, marketplace and commercial exchange. For example: a Shelley, and Coleridge.

But, as Romanticists, one has special access to the historical mo ment, however long it lasted, when the two traditions, the oral and written, the world of things and of objects, collide and transform each other: when they are published, like any the hand in conducting an orchestra made up of other in struments, objects producing artificial music. Could one say, then, that the artistic, emotional, and psychological process of turning objects into things was balanced by, responded to, defended against by the proliferation of instruments that re plenished the world of objects with items, tools, and products that could not become things? One could, I suppose, say any thing, especially if you are attracted to the symmetry of it— , T . ..... . , . .. other product, things turning into obiects, with no inherent but 1 doubt if it is more than a coincidence. purpose no matter how high the claims poets and critics make for their social and spiritual value. And objects turn into things, extending the possibility of human performance (automata, pantomime, the monster in Frankenstein, later ro bots, movies, telephones, and so on). As Tom Mitchell said: "the slogan for our times . . .is, not things fall apart, but things come alive" in his "Romanticism and the Life of Things: Fossils, Totems, and Images," first delivered at Mark Lussier's 2000 NASSR conference on Romantic Physicality, which, along with Mark's book, Romantic Dynamics: The Poetics of Physicality (Palgrave, 2000), initiated this long conversation we are joining now, a conversation wonderfully represented in Mark Blackwell's collection, The Secret Life of Things: Ani mals, Objects and It-Narratives in Eighteenth-Century England (2007) and John Plötz, "Can the Sofa Speak? A Look at Thing Theory," Criticism 47 (2005) 109-118. In this process, this intersection, one might even say metamorphosis, Words worth, as much a man of print as of speech, was pivotal, a mediator in disseminating an oral culture and converting it to a written, yoking the great Norse tradition with the classi cal, translating a world of things into a world of objects, books, and transforming a world of objects, the rocks, stones, ruined cottages, beggars, into things. Then as now, there are distinctions between objects and things, the refinements, the historical details that matter. In "Tintern Abbey," Wordsworth carefully distinguishes be tween things and objects: the "motion" and "spirit" "impels all thinking things, all objects of all thought/And rolls through all things" (100-103), including himself as thing, part of the living world of things. While he included objects in his world, he was a poet of things, the speaking faces of things, both natural and human. Things such as waters, wind, trees, a blind beggar, the pansy at his feet that repeats the same tale, things that sing, speak, roar, signify, admonish, provoke, remind. On the other hand, Wordsworth's objects do not speak. They require speakers, such as Keats, the master-ventriloquist, though not the "divine ventriloquists" that Coleridge considered poets to be. Keats is a poet of objects, deeply invested in the empiri cal, the properties, the object-ness: the clothes, food, cli mate, and sensuality in "Eve of St. Agnes," the textures of "Ode to Psyche," the palpable "Ode to Autumn" or obdurate materiality of "Ode on a Grecian Urn." While Wordsworth's things are anthropomorphic, Keats's objects are personified, each endowed with speech, an awakening and unanswerable question or an aphoristic wisdom invoking the music of the If you feel as I do that "things" seem to be better than season or the beauty of the object. While Wordsworth's "objects," that women have a right to be offended if they are things speak to him, communicate, Keats's objects are gno- treated as objects while they are called old things, or sweet mic and self-referential. These distinction and more between things, or hot things, that children correctly insist on naming Keats's objects and Wordsworth's things reveals the tradition objects to make them things, that primitive religions endow each worked out of and to which they are closely allied: objects with spirits to turn them into sacred things, and that Wordsworth's debts were to the oral tradition in which the objects, as a result are having a hard time of it, then you can concept and word "thing" survived, and Keats, a deeply tex- understand why some artists, sympathetic to the marginal, tual poet was shaped by the written. defending the excluded, standing up for minorities, devised an exhibit called "The Happiness of Objects," inspired, ac In Great Britain, the oral tradition, the language of cording to the catalogue, by Tom Mitchell's What Do Pictures conversation, Wordsworth's language of things, is mosdy Want. Mitchell and the artists in the exhibits emphasized one Nordic in origin, descended from fertility myths, sustained by answer: some objects don't want anything—they are autono generations of pastoral and agrarian cultures where language mous, self-sufficient, beyond desire, complete and happy describes birth, death, renewal, the cycles of life, the living without us, in the context of other objects. From the cata things, a language confined to northern valleys and tradi- logue: "The Happiness of Objects will attempt to capture what tional lives. Keats's poetry begins in reading Shakespeare, objects want from other objects, from the context of their Spenser, Milton, the iconic vision from "Sleep and Poetry," of display to potential response to their presence." 54</page><page sequence="4">From April 29 to July 29, 2007, the exhibit was on view at the Sculpture Center in Queens, New York City. Besides some visual illusions, the major attraction at the exhibit was a piece called "Flatland," four stories high, all connected by ladders and chutes, about twelve feet long, and only two feet wide, a great transparent wall, within which six artists dressed in colored overalls lived as if it were an ant colony, on display, viewable on their web site, sleeping, eating, talking on the phone, doing yoga, writing on a laptop, climbing up and down ladders, in brief, a narrative of humans as objects. In relation to a Romantic Object, the "Grecian Urn" for exam ple, it seems the very opposite, and raises questions about the sufficiency of language to describe it. But, the object, Flatland, like the Urn, defies the webs of meaning the human imagination would like to enmesh it in. Like the leaf-fringed legend haunting about its shape, the procession leading to the sacrifice, neither dead nor alive, the creatures in Flatland are suspended, puzzling, timeless, a procession, a sacrifice, bounded only by a shape, a frame. You may recall that the Ode ends badly, either the Urn or poet, voicing either a plati tude or riddle, a challenge, an admonition, or a promise, who knows, that truth is beauty, beauty truth. After many years of teaching and hearing people explain the poem, es pecially the conclusion, I am still both baffled and enchanted by it, I would like to add one more interpretation—for which I credit Flatland: 'You hang around, ask too many questions, and imply that you want more, too much. You want an an swer? Here's an answer Now get out of my face." That is the voice of the Urn extended into contemporary object hood. As Mitchell and others said, sometimes objects don't want anything, or nothing that humans can offer. The cata logue of the exhibit responds with "The Object Bill of Rights," "a non-exhaustive and disputable list," the author writes, which "will serve as ... a working document to be completed and informed by participating artists." The Object's Bill of Rights The Object has the right to many lovers The Object has the right to fuse with other objects The Object has the right to acknowledge its history of production The Object has the right to be classified The Object has the right to be out of order The Object has the right to refuse obsolescence The Object has the right to be dysfunctional The Object has the right to refuse or accept manipulation The Object has the right to define the terms of its reproduction The Object has the right to define the terms of its exchange with other objects The Object has the right to define the terms of its exchange with the environment The Object has the right to be gendered, non-gendered or hybrid The Object has the right to be claimed or forgotten, lost or found The Object has the right to escape authorship The Object has the right to get or not to get with the program The Object has the right to stand its own ground The Object has the right to be recognized The Object has the right to remain unidentifiable The Object has the right to be silent The Object has the right to create its own language The Object has the right to a new identity The Object has the right to free speech The Object has the right to be sedentary or traveling The Object has the right to pose as another object The Object has the right to choose the company it keeps The Object has the right to be cherished and examined The Object has the right to be absent The Object has the right to be a subject Sign or design? That is the question of the object. WORKS CITED Blackwell, Mark, ed., The Secret Life of Things: Animals, Objects and It-Narratives in Eighteenth-Century England. 2007; Brown, Bill.
