<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY: THE LIMITS OF DEMYTHOLOGIZING R. F. ALDWINCKLE* EVER since Rudolf Bultmann spoke of "demythologizing" the Chris- tian gospel, the term "myth" has become the occasion of increasing de- bate and ambiguity.' Until the meaning of this term has been defined with great- er precision, it is doubtful whether much progress can be made. Bultmann has not himself given much assistance in this process of clarification, but in other quarters the problem is being tackled with more success. For the English- speaking thinker, certain initial preju- dices must be overcome. The popular identification of myth with the legendary and the fictional must obviously be aban- doned completely if the term is to be used helpfully in theological and philo- sophical reconstruction. One wonders whether this is not an impossible under- taking now, in view of the associations of the term. Professor W. M. Urban, however, believes that it can be done. Let us summarize briefly the arguments he uses. He claims that the modern disparag- ing use of the word "myth" is a product of the eighteenth-century Aufklidrung and that this does justice neither to the classical use of it by Plato nor to the more modern use of it by critical minds, for whom the term has once again be- come neutral.2 "A myth is a story, the spontaneous product of unreflective and uncritical consciousness in which the forces of nature are represented in per- sonal or quasi-personal forms and as performing supernatural or superhuman functions."3 The two great classes of nature myths-the sun and the life myths-do not simply treat of fertility and sex in a merely human context. The supernatural world is depicted in terms of dramatic representations taken from those aspects of human knowledge and experience. What is being asserted in these myths is the real presence of the divine in the world of time and space, the immanence of the transcendent reality. Bultmann seems to use the word to describe two different things. The three-storied pre-Copernican universe of the biblical writers is for him mythol- ogy, in the sense that it involves a cos- mology now thoroughly discredited from the scientific point of view and which can never be reinstated. "Das Weltbild des Neuen Testaments ist ein mythisches." Here he seems to be talking of myth in the loose, popular sense. On the other hand, he speaks of myth when he is thinking of stories or descriptions of events in which the transcendent touches time and God breaks into this spatio- temporal world. This latter view, if car- ried through consistently, would agree with Urban's use of the term. * A graduate of the University of London, Russel F. Aldwinckle studied theology at Regent's Park, Oxford, and at the University of Strasbourg (D.Th., 1938). His doctoral thesis was published under the title, The Object of Christian Worship-a Study of the Notion of Objectivity in Relation to Religious Experi- ence. Articles recently published include "After Hu- manism, What?" (Crozer Quarterly, 1951) and "How Did Existentialism Become Atheistic?" (Re- view and Expositor, 1954). In 1947 Dr. Aldwinckle became a member of the faculty of McMaster Uni- versity, where he is associate professor of systematic theology. 267</page><page sequence="2">268 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION If we work with this second meaning, an important distinction must be made. There are "myths" which have to do with events considered to have "hap- pened" in some sense within the tem- poral process, and there are myths which describe the mystery of creation and the last things at the end of history of which no man has ever had direct experience. It is well known that when Plato came to deal with eschatology, he had re- course to the story or myth. In this sense, the eschatological forms of the New Testament serve a similar purpose as a description of the last events. It is this use of myth which raises in its clear- est form the fundamental metaphysical question, What purpose exactly does the myth serve, and does it give men knowledge which can be regarded as in- tellectually valid? This compels us to ask what the validity of the higher an- thropomorphism is; and this, in turn, raises the whole problem of symbol and its significance both in religion and in philosophy. Professor Urban seems to the writer to have dealt more convincingly than anyone else with this aspect of the ques- tion. Myth is not pseudo-science,4 nor is it the "illusion of primitive mental- ity" ;5 it is a "unique way of apprehend- ing the world with its own character and presuppositions."' Nevertheless, religion and myth must not be identified. They are not the same either in form or in spirit. In the religious consciousness, myth becomes symbolic. Pictures and signs taken from the sensible world are used to point to transcendent reality. The mythical is used to express the non- mythical, the phenomenal to symbolize the noumenal. What, then, is the nature of the religious symbol? It is not literally true, since it purports to suggest the transcendent by reference to that which is sensuous. On the other hand, literal truth in this sense does not exhaust the meaning of truth. The symbolism pro- vided by myth to the religious conscious- ness is to be taken seriously. It differs from every other type of symbol, in that it always stands for that which tran- scends the intuitive and the perceptible, as far as these words refer to the sensu- ous order. The religious consciousness, however, always considers the symbol to contain a nonsymbolic element, i.e., it refers to a transcendent reality which exists. Hence "the religious symbol is, then, in its essence-and epistemologi- cally-metaphysical in character, al- though psychologically it is more akin to poetry."' Now this does not mean that we can strip away the symbol and intuit the reality apart from it. The religious symbol remains for our human mode of apprehension the inevitable and indispensable means of expression. The Christian use of "father" would come in this category. This argument, however, depends for its validity upon another, namely, that "analogical predi- cation is a true form of predication, even when applied to the noumenal or metem- pirical."8 So much for Professor Urban's contention. Let us apply it to the biblical mythol- ogy and see whether it helps us to elu- cidate its significance and value. It must be conceded to Bultmann that some myths in the Bible are dead, i.e., they presuppose a world view, a cosmology, which is described in symbols now total- ly inadequate for the purpose. Such, for example, would be the Hebrew view of the earth as flat, resting on the abyss of waters, surmounted by a physical dome through whose windows the rain is poured. The idea of a local heaven to be reached by jet plane or a hell literally beneath the earth, showing evidence of</page><page sequence="3">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY 269 its existence in volcanoes, is mythical in this sense. Some demythologizing would seem to be essential here if the gospel is to be made not only relevant but meaningful at all to modern man. When engaged in this kind of thing, Bultmann seems to appear in the guise of a nineteenth-century liberal Protes- tant adapting Christianity to modern thought. And, indeed, he is not original in this, and the now despised liberals of the previous century deserve some credit for grappling with the problem. Surely, Emil Brunner is right in de- tecting here a basic ambiguity in Bult- mann's thought, an unwarranted con- fusing of myth and world view. To link the admittedly obsolete science of the biblical writers with the fundamental Christian tenets about the sending of the Son of God, his pre-existence, the atoning death, the coming judgment, and the Holy Spirit, and regard them both as mythical is to cause unnecessary confu- sion. The reason why the theological statements just mentioned often con- stitute an offense to modern man is not because they are obsolete science but because they run counter to modern man's understanding of his nature and destiny-and on this point modern man may very well be mistaken. So Emil Brunner, and with justice.' Few outside the ranks of the funda- mentalists would deny the necessity for some demythologizing in regard to bib- lical science. Nevertheless, in this at- tempt to rid biblical thought of obsolete science, the limitations of science itself must be recognized. It is Bultmann's failure to make this clear that some- times gives the impression that he is dis- missing as myth in the sense of fiction anything which does not fit into the modern scientific view of the world, if there is such a thing as a coherent world view generally accepted by all scientists. M. Casalis pertinently comments that Bultmann's description of modern man, lucid and master of himself, conscious of his scientific power and of his respon- sibility, reads rather strangely as coming out of Germany after the Hitler adven- ture and its aftermath." Even if it were true that science holds the position which Bultmann thinks it does, by what right and according to what intelligible prin- ciple do we erect modern science into an absolute, by which the forms of New Testament thought are dismissed as "myth"? This in turn demands a defini- tion of science, its methods and limita- tions. Perhaps we need to demythologize Bultmann's thought at this point. Can we really accept without further ado Bultmann's claim that the scientific world view is not mythical? If we rigor- ously exclude from the scientific account of the world's origins or from the various descriptions given of the evolutionary process all those elements which contain symbolic imagery worked up into some kind of story of events, what have we left? Surely nothing that can be called a scientific Weltanschauung. Julius Schnie- wind justifiably calls attention in his reply to Bultmann to the contention of both Karl Heim and Oswald Spengler that our scientific concepts are real- ly myths."' Atomic research has only strengthened the conviction that all pictorial descriptions of natural and cosmic happenings are inadequate, if not untenable; yet no scientist can ab- jure them if he wants to suggest a scien- tific world view. "In Bohr's model of the atom there is none of this picturesque language. Science no longer speaks the language of common-sense experience; it speaks the Pythagorean language. The pure symbolism of number super- sedes and obliterates the symbolism of</page><page sequence="4">270 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION common speech.""2 Cassirer speaks of the vanishing of figurative illustration from the latest scientific language. This dominance of the symbolism of number in modern scientific description certainly removes it a long way from the earlier idea that a mechanical model could be made of all natural processes and events. It is certainly not myth in the sense of pictorial story-telling, but this does not support without further argument the assumption that this scientific descrip- tion of the world in terms of number is more true than the "mythical" language of religion. The philosophical significance and validity of number still remain an open question, as well as the problem of whether this kind of description is the only one that can claim to give us real knowledge by contrast with religion. Nor must we allow to pass uncon- tested the claim that the biblical world view remains mythical in the crudest and most unrefined sense. Cassirer has point- ed out that a theory of myth encounters insuperable difficulties for the simple reason that "myth is non-theoretical in its very meaning and essence.""3 He also points out that philosophy could never take the myth-making function at its face value but sought to find within it a meaning philosophically intelligible and valid. He might, however, have added that religion, at least biblical religion, could not take over myth at its face value either. One can see, for example, how the Babylonian creation myth has undergone a profound and refining change under the influence of the pro- phetic conception of Yahweh to bring it into line with a more ethical and spiritual understanding of his will. It might still be answered that the Genesis account is still myth and not science. This is true as far as scientific detail is concerned; but if Professor Urban is right in claiming that the divorce of being and value leads to meaninglessness and unintelligibility, then the Genesis account of the source and ground of creation in terms of intel- ligent will directed toward the good is more rational than a scientific account of the world in terms of a symbolism of number abstracted from all considera- tions of value. This contention would not be touched by the admission that Genesis is not a textbook of geology or astronomy. Professor Urban, following Cassirer, maintains that science itself is one among several forms of symbolism. The posi- tivist scientist, if he is logical, must ex- clude all cosmological statements about nature as a whole, since such generalities, no less than those in religion, are incapa- ble of being empirically verified in the normal sense. This is not an attempt to reduce science to a subjective play of symbols with no reference to reality. The contention simply is that science, when it makes pronouncements about the whole of reality, is as "mythical" as religious thought and that the validity of its myths must be subject to the same test of fundamental intelligibility and coherence as that demanded in religion. The scientist must not be allowed to get away with the assumption that his myths are scientifically "proved," whereas re- ligious myths are an illegitimate leap into the realm of fantasy. Granted, how- ever, that, even with the recognition of the true nature of scientific symbolism, some demythologizing is necessary, what are we to say of those religious myths which seem to be inextricably bound up with all known forms of historical Chris- tianity? Let us take first a Christian belief which does not involve the vexed ques- tion of historical actuality. New Testa- ment scholars today are agreed that one</page><page sequence="5">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY 271 fundamental idea, present in the thought of Jesus and universal in the New Testa- ment, is that of the parousia of the Son of Man, linked with final judgment and the consummation of the ages. Here we have a dramatic expression, a myth, if you like, expressing the belief that God will ultimately rule in his universe in and through Christ. How would Bultmann go about demythologizing this? If Pro- fessor Urban is right, it is impossible anyhow. It would only be a case of sub- stituting one myth for another and say- ing, with Plato, something like this must be true. It is only fair to Bultmann to concede that his intention is not simply to eliminate at one stroke the mythology of the New Testament but rather criti- cally to interpret it; nor must the re- interpretation be simply a forcible im- position of the modern world-view upon the New Testament meaning. "Nur mtisste dann das Kriterium nicht aus der modernen Weltanschauung, son- dern aus dem Existenzverstandnis des Neuen Testaments selber erhoben wer- den.""4 "Der Mythos will nicht kos- mologisch, sondern anthropologisch-bes- ser existentiel interpretiert werden."'5 What, then, is this existential core of meaning? What is meant by "existen- tial" in this connection; and, even if it were possible to strip it of all the mytho- logical forms of the New Testament, would there be anything left, or would it leave us, as with the peeling of an onion, with nothing in the center when the stripping process is completed? Professor Henderson has suggested that Bult- mann may be doing what Aquinas did in his day, namely, attempting a rap- prochement between Christianity and current philosophy.' Now this, despite some modern theological reluctance, is a perfectly necessary and legitimate ac- tivity. Theological and philosophical activity cannot be kept in water-tight compartments. What needs to be kept in mind is that philosophy itself cannot dispense with various forms of symbol- ism in its delineation of reality, and therefore it cannot write off the religious myths which supply it with that sym- bolism.'7 Let us return to the problem of the parousia and the consummation of the ages. What is the existential core behind this myth, and can it be expressed when the New Testament form of it is com- pletely abandoned? It poses a special difficulty for Bultmann, since he is con- cerned with the present act of decision demanded by the confrontation of Jesus as Saviour with modern man in his sin and guilt. The New Testament eschatol- ogy, while involving the individual's decision, is also concerned to say some- thing significant about the whole tem- poral process and its relation to God's final rule within his universe. "He [i.e., the Christian believer] is now in Christ and yet expects His coming again. He has already died with Christ and risen with him, yet he looks forward to the resur- rection at the last day. Justice must be done to both aspects of salvation."'8 How far can we allow such a statement to stand? Does it not involve a view of the future course of events which, for the modern man, is "mythological" in the bad sense? Must we not rigorously "de- temporalize" the eschatology completely and say that modern man no longer needs to retain a futurist reference in his Christian thinking at this point? The parousia then means nothing more than a present existential decision when con- fronted with Jesus. This is a drastic pro- cedure, because, if Oscar Cullman is right,19 the New Testament writers cer- tainly did not think in this way, and we must be prepared for an overhauling of</page><page sequence="6">272 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the whole New Testament eschatologi- cal framework, which will look startling- ly different when the task is completed. But why should we detemporalize the New Testament eschatology in obedi- ence to modern existentialism or, for that matter, in deference to Hellenic mysticism or to any philosophy which has a defective understanding of the actuality of history and its significance for God. Will our demythologizing really make the gospel more intelligible to modern man? Is not Professor Hender- son right in contending that what mod- ern man really objects to is the activity within history of the transcendent God,20 and is this made any more congenial to the modern mind in the Bultmann form than in the existing forms of New Testa- ment eschatology? This does not mean that we are com- mitted to every detail of apocalyptic or eschatological imagery in the New Testa- ment or to the various forms of mil- lennialism based on Rev. 20:1-6 which have been imposed on the eschatology of Jesus, from which it is entirely ab- sent. It does mean, however, that the criterion of selection and judgment in regard to New Testament eschatology is the character and purpose of God, given in Jesus, which can be applied without detemporalizing the thought. Nor must this be interpreted in such a way as to suggest that the biblical cate- gories are incapable of being expressed in philosophical terms, since philosophy by its very nature is concerned with the timeless and not with the temporal. May not the philosopher hold with very good reason that "the fundamental categories of thought which we employ in historical and existential thinking-reason and purpose, freedom, will and love-must also be the fundamental categories of metaphysical thought."21 Are there not definite limits, therefore, to this process of demythologizing in regard to such a fundamental tenet of New Testament teaching as the parousia? It may be contended that the eschato- logical materials of the Gospels have a real significance for Bultmann, since faith for him not only liberates man from his past through a present existen- tial act but also delivers him to the fu- ture. "This is what is meant by 'faith': to open ourselves freely to the future."22 Unfortunately, what this means is not too clearly elucidated. Faith delivers a man to the future only in the sense of enabling him to achieve complete inner detachment from the world and there- fore inner freedom. It does not seem to mean for Bultmann the belief in a divine purpose which is being worked out in and through the historical process to a final consummation, despite his insistence on historic actuality. Eschatological exist- ence does mean being a new creature; but in the New Testament this is never separated from the conviction that the new creation in Christ is a participating in a dynamic process, the fulfilment of which is not yet. Bultmann concedes that to believe means to be traveling along the road between the "already" and the "not yet," always to be pursu- ing a goal; but the goal does not recede forever. The New Testament never denies that it will be reached when the divine purpose in history is achieved. "The New Testament gospel without the Parousia, or (second) Coming, would be as impossible as Marxism without the classless society."23 There is always the uneasy feeling that Bultmann is detem- poralizing the eschatology in a radical sense, despite his clear recognition that the New Testament never speaks of the training of the soul in mystical experi- ence but lays the stress rather on faith.</page><page sequence="7">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY 273 Wilder appears to be justified in claim- ing that "Bultmann and Dodd have granted the early Christians and our- selves a D-day, but seem to think that we can be content with that. No V-day or Victory day is necessary."24 Bultmann appears to believe in a transcendent God and therefore is not on the side of those who would treat some element of man's own nature as absolute. In this sense, he is Christian as against all the relativities of modern humanism. It is also true that the bib- lical notion of transcendence is bound up with spatial conceptions; but Bultmann seems hardly to be aware of the philo- sophical problem of symbolism which this raises, or at least he makes no men- tion of it. There are two questions which arise here: How far are the biblical writ- ers themselves working with spatial conceptions which they apply uncriti- cally in terms of crude physical analogy? and How far are they aware of the sym- bolic element in their thought? Is it making them too sophisticated to sug- gest that they are aware that they are using symbols taken from the sensuous and the intuitable, i.e., from space and time, to describe what Professor Urban calls the "metempirical"? If a symbol is not literally true in the ordinary sense, it does not mean that it is untrue, as we have already seen. It certainly seems odd, as Edwyn Bevan said, to think of moral and spiritual worth as increasing or decreasing according to the distance outward from the earth's surface." Yet this appears to be implied in the almost universal belief among mankind that the sky is the abode of the Supreme Being.26 It is hardly possible to doubt that primitive man did locate his god up there in the sky, and this has left its effect upon the early strands of the bib- lical record; but did not the men of the Bible themselves move beyond this level of thinking? No doubt the process from the cruder anthropomorphic conception to one more consciously symbolic was a long one, but there is good reason to believe that it had been accomplished within the bib- lical period itself. A somewhat long quotation from Edwyn Bevan is jus- tified because of its great interest in this connection: We may say at any rate that by the time that the constituent of the book of Genesis, which modern critics call the "Priestly Code," and which they believe to belong to a time near that of Ezra, was composed, a conception of God as locally circumscribed by His sitting in the sky had given place to a more worthy one. The first chapter of Genesis is assigned to the Priestly Code and in its first verse it demolishes in a single phrase any idea of God as coinciding with the idea of the sky. "In the beginning God cre- ated the heavens." If God created the heavens, He must have existed in almighty power before there was any heaven there at all. Perhaps one does not easily realize in the case of a verse so familiar what a breach it meant with the con- ception hitherto almost universal in the religious traditions of mankind.27 If this comment is just, then the notion of spatial transcendence has already been demythologized, and this some centuries before Christ! If Bultmann replies by asking why the spatial lan- guage is still used, the answer must be that the choice is between utter silence or the use of symbols taken from the sensuous and the intuitable. That cer- tain symbols have become charged with transcendent meanings and implications because of the role they have played in mankind's increasing apprehension of God fits them for, and justifies their con- tinued use in, religious language. Let us now consider another element in the Christian kerygma, which does involve reference to an event in history and which in some sense was appre-</page><page sequence="8">274 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION hended by man. Bultmann describes the Resurrection as a "typically mythi- cal event." "Die Auferstehung Christi aber-ist sie nicht ein schlechthin mythi- sches Ereignis?"28 Does he mean that it has no historical or factual basis? The Resurrection, he suggests, cannot be dated in history, only the disciples' faith in the Resurrection and their witness to it. Does this mean that no historical val- ue can be given to the empty tomb? Further, if the answer is Yes, does it mean that the Resurrection appearances, separated from the empty tomb, are not patient of the interpretation which sees in them evidence of the approach of the "risen Christ" to the disciples in any sense other than that which would re- duce them to the "psychological" ex- periences of the disciples? The apostolic testimony, which is the vital thing according to Bultmann, is the means whereby the "saving event" becomes situated in time and space and thereby becomes the present eschatologi- cal fact which demands of contemporary man an existential decision. The task of the church is to make sure that modern man's refusal of the gospel is not his refusal of the false stumbling block due to the mythological form in which the gospel is expressed, but is a real refusal of the true scandal of the Cross. Bult- mann does not believe that the gospel can ever be so reduced as to make it easy for modern man to accept it without experiencing any sense of offense. This, however, does not absolve us from the necessity of continually seeking a more faithful translation of the gospel into terms which will give offense at the prop- er point, and not an offense which the modern man may rightly resent because of the form in which it is presented to him. We may agree with Bultmann that the gospel can never be exhaustively expressed in scientific and historical categories as these are commonly under- stood. The truth of the Resurrection has never been accepted by any man simply on the basis of a careful weighing of the historical data. Nor need we refuse to admit that such an event contains implications and an element of mystery which escape satisfactory intellectual formulation. Yet surely the act of faith, which says Jesus is Lord, is not divorced from some intellectual conviction that this event, however much it defies full explanation, is rooted in the actuality of history. If, of course, we approach our historical investigation with the assumption that "nature" is ruled by a rigid uniformity of natural law and that we know the precise limits beyond which there can be no modification of this uniformity, then are we not again vic- tims of myth, but this time of scientific myth? Here again is ambiguity. Does Bultmann describe the Resurrection as mythical because it runs counter to the dogma of the uniformity and unbreaka- bleness of natural law? And, if so, must not this dogma itself be subject to criti- cal appraisal?29 Or does he regard it as the supreme case of the activity of the transcendent God in history, in which case modern man's difficulty with it is not scientific at all but religious, a con- sequence of his refusal to face the reality of God and his relation to history and man. It is no doubt useful to distinguish between historisch, by which is meant the occurrence of an event at a particular place and time in history, and geschicht- lich, which describes the eschatological significance of the event for man here and now.30 "Eschatological" is not here a futurist reference to the last things but the "existential" import of the event</page><page sequence="9">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY 275 evoking human decision in the present. What is unsatisfactory is that Bultmann never seems to make clear the applica- tion of these terms in regard to such an event as the Resurrection. While most Christians would agree that the Resur- rection is geschichtlich and eschatological in the sense that the believer may meet the risen Christ here and now in the Spirit-guided community or koinonia, nevertheless it is also historisch in the first sense; otherwise the believing com- munity would never have come into existence at all. It is therefore not ade- quate to say "Das Osterereignis als die Auferstehung Christi ist kein historisches Ereignis; als historisches Ereignis ist nur der Osterglaube der ersten Junger fassbar."31 This is to reduce the Resur- rection once again to psychology and thereby implicitly to question the early disciples' interpretation of this event, which was emphatically not merely psy- chological. We must still insist that the Resurrection is historisch in a sense other than merely the apostolic conviction that Christ was risen. Otherwise we can give no intelligible account of how that conviction arose and therefore of the rise of the Christian church. This means that any existential decision I may make here and now in the presence of Christ cannot be intelligibly related to those events which have made my decision possible. Or it gives us a faith rooted in a kind of irrationalism from which even Kierkegaard, with all his greatness, is not free. Karl Barth's criticism, of Bultmann's treatment of the Resurrection is here surely justified. He rightly insists that the Easter event is not the arising of the belief in Him as risen, but rather His manifestation to them, i.e., the disciples. Otherwise, the disciples' belief would have no object other than its own pecul- iar psychological reality. The act of God in the Resurrection would be identical with the fact that they believed. Bult- mann's rejection of the forty days is based on the assumption that no event can take place in space and time which cannot be proved by modern historical methods; but these methods themselves contain silent presuppositions as to what can and cannot happen, assumptions which are not binding for a view of the world which does not exclude from the beginning the possibility of action by the transcendent God. Thus, says Barth, in spite of Bultmann, we must still con- tinue "die Auferstehung Jesu und seine Erscheinung als Auferstandener unter seinen Jungern als eine wirkliche, zu ihrer besonderen Zeit geschehene Ge- schichte zu verstehen."32 This is not affirming that the event of the Resurrection is historisch on the basis of faith. While it is true that no man can say Jesus is Lord save by the Holy Spirit, this cannot be construed to mean that the evidence which con- vinced the disciples that Jesus was risen was wholly unrelated to the normal criteria by which a valid experience of an objective reality is judged. It is no doubt true that the distinction between hal- lucination and the normal perception of the external world is more complex than the ordinary person believes, but per- sistence, congruity, and agreement re- main the foundations of our acceptance of an external world.33 Apart from solip- sism, which no sane man has ever made the basis of his actual behavior, the reali- ty of the external world has never been seriously questioned, not even by ideal- ism. But what has this to do with the Resurrection of Jesus? After all, he did not appear to everyone, but only to disciples; nor does he continue to appear to men in this way with the same per-</page><page sequence="10">276 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION sistence as the objects of the physical world. Persistence, congruity, and agree- ment can, therefore, in the case of the Resurrection appearances, be referred only to a comparatively limited number of men and women in whom the condi- tioning factor of faith was present. That the reality of the Resurrection could be proved only if all men had seen him in- volves a test not even applied to our knowledge of the external world. All I know of the top of Mount Everest is given to me through the testimony of men who have had firsthand experience of this physical reality. I believe what I hear about Everest because I have reasons for believing that Col. Hunt and his party were honest men in recording what they saw. I can hear them lecture, read their books, see their pictures. The weight of testimony, which leads me to believe that they actually undertook this expedition and were successful, is so great that seriously to doubt it would imperil my rational understanding of the world in which I live. It may be ob- jected that this is a false and misleading analogy. After all, I can test the reality of their testimony by climbing Mount Everest myself or by flying over it in a plane or both. It is hardly likely that I shall ever do either of these things; yet I shall still believe. I can actually hear them speak, it may be said, whereas the Christian can no longer question the original eyewitnesses of the Resurrection. This is true, but the church still exists as the living historical witness to the truth which the early disciples attested. The church is a contemporary witness linked in the unbroken tradition of Chris- tian life and worship. The scientist may still insist that if I put myself in the same place and set of conditions as Hil- lary and Tensing, I can have the same knowledge of Everest as they had, where- as I cannot put myself in the same posi- tion as the first eyewitnesses and see the risen Christ as they did. That is true if we agree that the appearances of the New Testament cannot be equated with mystical experiences of the risen Christ which later generations have enjoyed. Such a distinction the evidence compels us to make, however much we may dis- cover some common characteristics, as Dr. Selwyn does, for example, in his essay on the Resurrection." Yet when all has been said, it is the sense of ra- tional congruity and essential trust- worthiness which constitutes the most compelling reason for my belief in the Resurrection of Christ and in certain things about the summit of the highest mountain in the world. These early disciples certainly be- lieved that the risen Jesus had appeared to them in the spatiotemporal continuum in a way which they themselves distin- guished from faith. Rightly or wrongly, they believed that they had "seen" him. Their faith becomes inexplicable apart from this evidence, which seemed con- vincing to them; and, apart from their faith, the emergence and continuance of the Christian church become likewise inexplicable. It is true enough that be- lief in the Resurrection of Jesus presup- poses a certain world view as to what may or may not happen in the kind of world in which we live. It further refuses to substitute without inquiry an explana- tion of the course of events other than that which seemed compelling to the earliest disciples. This, however, is not to say that faith creates the fact of the Resurrection; otherwise the reference to historic evidence would be superfluous, which was the case neither for the first believers nor for those who come after them. There are some not hostile to the</page><page sequence="11">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY 277 Christian faith who would no doubt claim that the problem can be solved at a stroke by adopting a "veridical vision" theory of the Resurrection ap- pearances.35 This, it is asserted, gets rid of many perplexing problems of histori- cal interpretation; it does not rest the Christian case exclusively on the empty tomb; and it is more reasonable to be- lieve that God can manifest himself to men in a way congruous with the psy- chological laws which govern the mind than by a miracle which seems to involve a suspension of all known laws. This at first sight is plausible and attractive, except for the haunting doubt that the early believers in the Resurrection did not interpret their experience of the risen Lord in this way. Furthermore, as A. E. Taylor persuasively maintains, if the uniformity of law runs through the psychic as well as the personal worlds, which seems to follow inevitably from the very concept of uniformity, a psy- chological miracle becomes as improba- ble as a physical one."3 On the other hand, if uniformity of law is not absolute in the psychological realm, why make it so in the physical on the basis of an un- proved dogma? But if the dogma of uniformity is questioned, the way is open for factors in the Resurrection of Jesus which affected the minds of the disciples not only from within in psycho- logical terms but also from without in physical terms, however puzzling this interaction of physical and psychical may be. Perhaps we should remind our- selves, too, that this miracle is an every- day occurrence in the workings of the human mind in and through the organ of the body. It is not suggested that Bultmann is a naive apostle of the natural sciences or that he is unaware of the limits of the scientific world view. Despite this, however, he does in practice seem to find the criterion of the possible in this same method. Otherwise why should he make this dogmatic assertion: "An his- torical fact which involves a resurrection from the dead is utterly inconceiva- ble."?37 Why? Presumably because Bult- mann is working, Schniewind charges, with the closed world view of modern science which makes any action of the transcendent God in nature and history antecedently impossible, long before any question of historical evidence is raised. One can hardly escape the feeling that Bultmann is himself aware of an incon- sistency in his thought here. He admits that some people will regard all language about an act of God as mythological, even when it has been stripped of all supernatural and miraculous elements which appear to contradict the scientific world view.38 When he speaks of an "act of God," what kind of God does he mean? Does he mean a God limited by natural laws regarded as absolute in themselves, which is a kind of deism, or the biblical conception of God, which regards nature as plastic to his will. The latter cannot simply be dismissed as unscientific myth, because it can be stated and defended in terms of a ra- tional philosophy. Behind Bultmann's treatment of the Resurrection is not so much the problem of myth versus science as it is a fundamental clash of basic as- sumptions concerning the nature of the world and its relation to its creative ground and source. What is evidently needed is a more precise definition of "myth" and the range of its application. Bultmann's criticism of some conceptions of the Holy Spirit or of grace as quasi-natural forces mechanically mediated would evoke sympathy from many Christians who are far removed from his general posi-</page><page sequence="12">278 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION tion in other respects. John Oman told us long ago that grace cannot be the mere might of omnipotence: What is a moral personality and how is it succoured? To consider instead the coruscation of omnipotence as resistless might and of omnis- cience as undeflected fixity of plan, is as if an engineer could only prove his power by making engines weighty enough to break all the bridges. Real power, on the contrary, is never violent, and real wisdom never rigid.39 Inadequate conceptions of the Holy Spirit are not infrequent in Christian history and are justly subject to attack. Some conceptions of original sin do make impossible that true moral autonomy which, Oman again rightly insisted, must exist if there is to be a truly "re- ligious dependence" on God. Bultmann is right to demand a rethinking of many of these issues, but it is highly doubtful whether the introduction of the word "myth" is of much help in this direction. When, however, we have stripped away the obsolete science, which is an unnecessary stumbling block to modern man, and rethought our conception of freedom, grace, and the Holy Spirit so that they more truly express the Chris- tian understanding of God and man and their relationship, we are left with myth in Professor Urban's sense as that dra- matic element in the gospel record which furnishes those symbolically valid ideas which constitute the essential truth and express it in a way which neither science, philosophy, nor poetry can adequately do. The major problem, therefore, is not one of demythologizing the gospel in Bultmann's sense to make it fit the scientific world view but rather of finding those "myths" which provide the sym- bols which most adequately express valid metaphysical insights about the nature and activity of God. Nobody is as yet in a position to say what elements of the New Testament are absolutely necessary for this purpose. It might be possible to express the significance of the Cross for the redemption of men without employ- ing any of the terms which derive from the Jewish conception of sacrifice. Dr. H. Wheeler Robinson in his last book, commenting on the use of sacrificial metaphors in Christian thinking, wrote: But the metaphor in itself does not satisfy our thought, when we try to turn it into a the- ory; or rather, shall we say, true as far as it can take us, needs completion from a wider range of thought, and all the more because the practice from which the metaphor is drawn is no longer with us, to actualize the intensity of the spiritual meaning.4" As long as the Bible is read, it is doubtful whether such metaphors will ever be dispensed with; but we cannot deny off- hand the possibility of effectively pre- senting the Cross to men without the necessary use of sacrificial metaphors. What is obviously needed is a careful study of the various religious symbols provided by the New Testament "my- thology" and their metaphysical validity. This involves a philosophical justifica- tion of what has been called the "higher anthropomorphism." The revival of bib- lical theology has made this an urgent necessity, since we seem to be in grave danger of a "demythologizing" which distorts or an authoritative demand for the acceptance of the kerygma on a take- it-or-leave-it basis, with no reasons given. The assumption that the modern biblical emphasis has rendered philo- sophical theology unnecessary is one that will not stand examination. "There can be no religion of mere humanity," says Professor Urban, "but there can also be none of mere deity. Doubtless man without God is not man, but it is equally true that, while God without man would still be God, he would not be the God of any city that man has yet seen or ever will see."41</page><page sequence="13">MYTH AND SYMBOL IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY 279 NOTES 1.
