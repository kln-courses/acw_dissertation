<plain_text><page sequence="1">The 1974 May Show: May 1 through June 9 Fifty-fifth Annual Exhibition by Artists and Craftsmen of the Western Reserve The Fifty-fifth May Show has been juried and installed; the catalogue has been printed; and the many details, questions, and problems that inevitably arise have been ably handled by Tom Hinson, Assistant Curator of Modern Art, and his staff. It now remains for the artists, public, and critics to pass judgment on the exhibition. For the fourth straight year, the jurying was done by members of the professional staff of the Museum. Artists whose work has been excluded from the show will surely think we lack objectivity; others may not have entered because they suspected we could not be objective. Yet, a careful appraisal of the exhibition reveals that it is diverse in style and of a high level of professional accomplishment. It is larger than last year, despite the fact that fewer works were entered, but it could have been smaller only by sacrificing serious works of quality. One speaks perhaps too glibly of quality. The question most frequently asked about a juried show is, What are the jurors' criteria? Although it may seem to be a specious quibble, there is an attitude implied in the question that should not exist in any juror's mind. A juror should not approach his task with a set of pre-formed standards which he applies to works of art to take their measure. Rather, he should approach it as a pupil hoping to be shown something new and significant or something familiar but so well done that he must acknowledge the mastery of technique. When he first scans the entries, he has immediate reactions-both positive and negative to many works, and he is unsure about others. When he goes over the works a second time it is with a more careful eye. But the question he asks himself is, "Why do I respond to this work as I do?" rather than, "Is this work good or bad?" It is a fine but essential distinction; for he must then ask himself other questions such as: "What does this artist appear to be trying to do?" "Has he done it well?" "Is it important to do it?" "Am I prejudiced for or against such an aim?" "Is it unique?" "Is it a variation on another artist's theme?" or, "Does it border on outright plagiarism?" In the end, the jurors' conclusions are presented in the form of the May Show, which will, in turn, be judged by others. In brief, it is creative artists who invent aesthetic values; the rest of us only try to recognize them. This year we believe we have recognized that enormous gains have been made in the quality of prints, drawings, and photographs submitted. As a result, these were the most difficult categories to evaluate. It was an arduous task for the jury to make a single selection for the $1,000 award from-the large numbers of works entered in these areas. But finally the strong image and consummate craftsmanship of Hugh Kepets' print, Beverley Road, would not be denied. By comparison, painting and sculpture seemed to suffer. Yet, when the paintings selected are considered carefully, it is clear that they too are strong. Once again, Edwin Mieczkowski appears as one of the most serious and skillful artists working in this area. His subtle painting Lost Language: Olympia on Bellflower Road richly deserves the $1,000 award. Sculpture was more difficult, and for the second time in recent years the only reasonable solution seemed to be to split the award between two artists and their works: Howard Kottler for Bushel and a Peck, and Fred Glover for Hopi Indian with Hair in Squash Blossom Style. Neither is large, but both are extraordinarily skillful; Glover's work is a brilliantly executed bronze and Kottler's work is imbued with a surrealist-related poetry. The crafts were fewer in number and seem less outstanding in quality than in past years. This is due in part to the fact that many artists working in ceramics or textiles, for example, have entered their works as sculptures. Nevertheless, a number of very fine pieces were selected for the exhibition. The award in this category was also split. Gregory N. Lucic received $500 for his full-bodied pot in muted brown tones, Carp Pot; and James E. Wilcox Jr. was awarded $500 for his finely executed, imaginative images in glass, Pair Bond Number 2. John Paul Miller's exquisite Pendant-Brooch received the coveted Horace E. Potter Memorial Award for Excellence in Craftsmanship. Tom Hinson faced special and unusual problems this year and he solved them with the able assistance of Mrs. Andrea Redhead, Jeannine Furrer, and an excellent staff including the invaluable help of volunteers from The Junior Council. He began answering questions about the exhibition as early as February; these increased in volume until the works Were all finally submitted-and beyond. He coordinated the contributory activities of the 138</page><page sequence="2">Registrar's Department, the Comptroller's Office, the Public Relations Department, the Museum Designer, the Publications Office, the Department of Photography, the Print Shop, the Department of Art History and Education, the Department of Buildings and Grounds, the jurors and artists. Furthermore, he had to compete with others for the services of these departments. It is a formidably difficult and complex task calling for diplomacy coupled with determination. And after the show has been chosen and hung and most of the rest of us go on to other tasks, he must then face the problems of the previews, the inevitable complaints and criticisms, and the difficulties accompanying sales. This year, for example, we finally confronted a problem that has been occurring increasingly in recent years: the person who changes his mind after making a purchase, but neglects to inform the Museum until the exhibition ends. While it is understandable how this can happen, the purchaser probably does not realize that he has deprived an artist (who may be dependent on the sale of his work) of part of his income. It is difficult to explain to an artist who has seen a sold sign on his work for over a month, that the buyer changed his mind, thus removing the work from the market for the duration of the exhibition. For this reason, the Trustees suggested this year that we ask purchasers at the Patrons' Preview to pay at the time of purchase. After the preview, purchasers will be given forty-eight hours to pay on the assumption that they may not have visited the exhibition with the intention of acquiring a work of art and so might not have the necessary funds with them. A total of 2,179 works were submitted by 1,293 artists, representing a decline of 1 61 works and 71 artists from last year. On the face of it one might wonder what is wrong. Yet the high level of quality suggests that things are very well indeed. There is simply far more activity in the visual arts than in the past; there are more galleries, more art-oriented organizations of various kinds, and more exhibitions. This is a healthy sign-a sign that many people no longer consider the May Show the only significant art event of its kind in the community. This is as it should be. Selected for the show were 371 works by 312 artists-an increase of 106 works and 82 artists accepted over 1973. The inescapable conclusion is that the number of high level, professional works being created in this region is increasing, and the opportunities to exhibit these works are also increasing. Edward B.
