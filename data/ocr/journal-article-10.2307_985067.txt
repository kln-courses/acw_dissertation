<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS ARTHUR DARBY NOCK Professor of the History of Religion, Harvard University (Read April 25, 1942) ABSTRACT Plutarch quotes Demosthenes as saying that the Pythia (the mouthpiece of Apollo at Delphi) must be suspected of taking Philip's side. Plutarch was a piousman, a religious functionary at Delphi, and a firm believer in the fulfilment of oracles and omens, but he shows no trace of disapproval; in fact the reverse. A Greek knew that Apollo's mouthpiece was human, as- sumed that he must use his reason in making decisions after consulting the oracle, and yet believed that the Pythia's utterances must be fulfilled. So in other methods of divination he recognized the human element, but did not doubt their supernatural basis. Greek rationalism was not modern rationalism, and did not create the difficulties which we might expect. The gods were larger Greeks, not easily shocked: even outside Greece there was little objection to action which we should regard as religious trickery. In Greece man was the measure of all things, and a Greek, in his liberalities to the gods and their temples, could without blame be regarded as seeking to make a favorable impression upon his fellow citizens. This is an attitude very different from the legalism of Rome or the theocentric emphasis of the Near East. Nevertheless, it existed together with a deep sense of awe and a sharp awareness of the line between men and gods. In religion, as in other things, classical Hellenism represents a delicate balance which defies our efforts at formulation. FOR the myths and rituals of the ancient, Greeks we have a large, though unevenly dis- tributed, body of information which admits of analysis and study. This paper is devoted to the personal attitudes of the Greeks; as with people of any time and place, these are more elusive, and our attempt to recapture them de- pends largely upon incidental remarks in litera- ture, particularly upon those so phrased as to leave little doubt that their authors felt that they were speaking as any sensible man would. We shall draw much from Plutarch, who combined piety, reflection, and respect for the old ways.' In his life of Demosthenes, he tells (19) how, some supernatural fortune or revolution of events seemed then to be bringing to an end Greek 1 The Lives are quotwd by the section-division of the Lindskog-Ziegler edition.

Hanfmann for friendly aid. freedom and to show portents of the future: among these were terrifying prophecies by the Pythia (who was the mouthpiece of Apollo at Delphi). "Demosthenes," he continues (20), * . . "is said to have told the people not to pay heed to oracles or give ear to prophecy; but to suspect the Pythia of taking Philip's side: 2 he reminded the Thebans of Epaminondas 3 and 2 A treaty of 356 between Philip and the Chalcidians, published by D. M. Robinson, Trans. Am. Philol. Ass., LXV (1934) 103 ff., quotes a Delphic oracle approving friendship between the contracting parties. This ante- dates the Phocian coup and Philip's championship and subsequent control of Delphi and the Amphictyony: and, as M. Segre remarks, Riv. fil., LXIII (1935) 497ff., is an approval after the event; there is no proof that Delphi influenced the decision. Xen., Hell., VII, 1.27 notes that the Thebans and their allies and the Spartans, having met at Delphi to discuss peace, did not consult the god as to how it should come to pass but deliberated themselves: the point is not that it was usual to consult Apollo about a peace but that, though at Delphi, they did not consult him. Herod., I, 69, says that Croesus made an alliance with Sparta in accordance with a Delphic oracle; Thucyd., 1, 103, that the Spartans let certain Messenians escape, in accordance with a command from the same source, and the Magnesians in an arbitration award of 139 B.C. state that their relations with the Cretans are included in oracles (Dittenberger, Syll. inscr. gr., ed. 3, 685.24). Neverthe- less, the only other instance known to me of a direct ref- erence to an oracle as approving a treaty is Syll., 633.15ff. (180 B.C.), where Apollo of Didyma is quoted as recom- mending that Miletus and Heraclea should make terms- and for Miletus Apollo of Didyma was the great local god (cf. A. Rehm, Milet, I, iii, 196 on the consultation of the oracle about additions to the citizen body, and U. v. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Gott. gel. Anz., 1914, 95f.). Philip appears therefore to have made an exceptional and deliberate use of the oracle, with an eye on Greek public opinion. I Probably an allusion to the disregard by Epaminondas of unfavorable omens before Leuctrai (Diod. Sic., XV, 52.4: ib. 7 " having studied philosophy and made prudent use of the modes of reasoning imparted in education "). Epami- nondas is said also to have spread stories of supernatural signs at Thebes and Lebadea pointing to victory (53.4. For such action, cf. p. 478 later). Plutarch in his lost Epaminondas certainly discussed the omens pointing to a Spartan defeat (Ages., 28.6), perhaps also E.'s dismissal of hostile signs; [Plut.] Reg. Imp. Apophth., Epam., 8, p. 192 E-F [n. 38 later] may well be drawn from Plutarch; cf. L. Peper, De-Plutarchi Epaminonda, Diss.

Those men, he said, reckoned all such things pretexts for cowardice, and used their reason. Up to this point he was a good man." Then follows the tale of his flight from the ranks at the battle of Chaeronea. "Up to this point he was a good man": aiv4p AyyacOs may be primarily "a brave man," as in the phrase sometimes applied to a warrior, aiv&amp;p &amp;yaO0s yevO'AEVOS "having proved himself a brave man"; but even in popular language it has a much wider use and certainly Plutarch sets the stamp of his moral approval on the actions of Demosthenes, which include his attitude towards the Pythia. This is significant. Plutarch was neither critical of old usage nor sceptical of divine providence and interference in human life: quite the reverse. He was a priest at Delphi,4 devoted to its good name and wellbeing (Pyth. orac. 29, p. 409 C), and his duties included that of presence on some of the occasions on which the Pythia gave responses. He wrote three treatises concerning the oracle, and is credited with a lost Collection of oracles.5 Further, he was familiar with Cynic and Epicurean attacks on belief in this and other ways of foreknowing the future. Two objections in particular, first that the activity of Delphi had declined and many other oracles had disappeared, and second that the Pythia no longer answered ifn verse, evoked from him elaborate discussions: and the first was for him no mere theoretical question to which he could give an automatic answer.6 83. For the sentiment cf. n. 18 and Herod., VII, 139.6: Plutarch's attitude tells against any inference that Herod- otus is sceptical of the oracle. 4 Dittenberger, Syll. inscr. gr. (ed. 3), 829, n. 4 (with an additional fragment published by E. Bourguet in B. Latzarus, Les idees religieuses de Plutarque, 37 n. 3). The widespread equation of hiereus "priest" with prophetes at Delphi is confirmed by Plut., Quaest. Conv., VIII, 1.2, p. 717 D: and An seni res publica gerenda sit, 17, p. 792 F suggests Plutarch's practical concern with the oracle. For the presence of the prophetes on duty cf. H. W. Parke, Class. Quart., XXXIV (1940), 85 ff. 5It. Flaceliere, Plutarque, Sur les oracles de la Pythie, 6ff. argues that Pyth. orac. comes very late in Plutarch's life. Delphi was the background of Concerning Isis and Osiris; for apologetic in De sera num. vindicta, cf. G. Meautis, Me. Navarre, 305ff. 6 Indications of the future were a proof of Providence (Aelian V. H., II 31, Nock, Sallustius, lxviii). For earlier philosophic discussions cf. F. Jaeger, De oraculis quid veteres philosophi iudicaverint (Diss. Rostock, 1909, publ. 1910), adding now P. Berol. 11517 (last discussed by S. Eitrem, APArMA Martino P. Nilsson dedicatum, 170ff.: the legendary villain who taunts and threatens, receives supernatural chastisement. There is a miracle story in Def. orac., 45, p. 434 D-E). The argument (Pyth. orac., For all his use of inherited arguments, his mind and his heart were deeply engaged, and he could not adopt the reserved pragmatic attitude of Cic. Div., II, 70. He held that the Pythia spoke by divine if not by verbal inspiration (Pyth. orac., 7, p. 397 C; 20, p. 404 B), and rejected any sugges- tion that prophecy was simply a matter of lucky forecasting (Pyth. orac., 11, p. 399: cf. Cic., Div. I, 105, calliditas). So again he defended the valid- ity of visions (Dion, 2.3ff. 7), and signs (Gen. Socr., 12, p. 581-2), including those given by images of deities (Coriol., 38: cf. p. 477 later 8), and told how events appeared to justify both the experi- mental and the su-pernaturalist views of a portent in Periclean Athens (Pericl., 6).9 Nevertheless, he praises Demosthenes for tell- ing the Thebans and Athenians to disregard prophecy, and makes him produce precedents not only from Pericles, who might be regarded as leaning towards rationalism, but also from Epaminondas, the hero in whom Plutarch's local pride found a particular satisfaction.10 There is no trace of any feeling that Demosthenes had said anything irreverent; and this attitude was not simply the product of later reflection or of enthusiasm for the cause of the Greek city-states, strong as this was in Plutarch (cf. Arat., 38.7). 28, p. 408, cf. Def. orac., 8, p. 413 F) that oracular answers on public issues were no longer needed is perhaps adapted from the argument that oratory had declined because political conditions no longer called for it (e.g. Tacitus, Dial.: on other aspects of that discussion, cf. Nock, Class. Rev., XLVI (1932), 173. See also Plut., Praec. ger. reip., 17, p. 814 C).-For the seriousness of Plutarch's concern, cf. Pyth. orac., 29, p. 408 D: the decline itself, earlier dis- cussed (Cic., Div., I, 38 with Pease's note, 95: Strab., XVI, 2.38f., p. 762, probably based on Posidonius, as K. Reinhardt argues, Poseidonios uber Ursprung u. Ent- artung, and contrasting the present with a better past, not attacking the oracle), must be a divine work (Def. orac., 8, p. 413-4: cf. the supposed oracle quoted by Porph. ap. Euseb., Praep. evang., V, 16.1). On Plutarch's point of view, cf. U. v. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen, II, 497ff., WV. Nestle, Die griechische Re- ligiositat, III, 139ff. With an ample margin of error for dreams: cf. De sera num. vind., 28, p. 566 C, Cic. Div., II, 144f., Latzarus, op. cit., 143, Weiland [n. 34], 79. Even in earlier times a vision was sometimes thought to need confirmation by the oracle: cf. Ph. E. Legrand, Quo animo Graeci . . . divinationem adhibuerint, 42 n., 2. 8 Cf. Pyth. orac., 8, p. 398 B, where Plutarch gives his view as an hypothesis (Flaceliere 51). 9So Aemil. Paul., 17.9f.: Paullus knows the scientific explanation of the eclipse, but offers abundant sacrifice. 10 E.g., Arat., 19.3; Peper, op. cit., 50ff. [Plut.] De lib. educ., 10, p. 8 A-B, groups Pericles, Archytas, Dion, Epaminondas as statesmen with a tincture of philosophy; but this tractate is generally rejected.</page><page sequence="3">474 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK The orator's antagonist, Aeschines, quoted the remark about the Pvthia, and characterized Demosthenes as "being illbred and making full use of the license which you had given him" (III, 130)-not as being blasphemous; and Aeschines missed no chance of vituperation."1 The Pythia spoke for Apollo: in fact, we often read of Apollo as sitting on the tripod and prophesying: but the voice was hers, and she was human, and so were the officials who pre- sided over the oracle, were present at consulta- tions, and in earlier times 12 appear to have turned her disordered utterances into cautious hexameter verse. She and they alike were ex- posed to fear (Pyth. orac., 26, p. 407 D), pressure, partiality and even bribery, and in the great days the officials seem to have followed policies.13 (WTe can hardly ascribe the last to the Pythia, who was perhaps at all times, as in Plutarch's day, "inexperienced and uninformed about al- most everything." 14) Before the time of He- rodotus, the Athenians themselves said that the Alcmaeonids had secured by bribery the oracular command to Sparta to expel Hippias from Athens "Immediately afterwards (131) he criticizes Demos- thenes for acting without successful sacrifices. 12 Cf. Parke as cited n. 4. In spite of the evidence discussed later for the ease with which agreed legal fictions were retained, I can hardly believe that Plutarch had any- thing to do with framing the answers to questioners. He knows the view that in older days men of poetic gifts used to sit around the oracle and to supply metrical vehicles for the prophetic utterances (Pyth. orac., 25, p. 407 B: cf. Strab., IX, 3.5, p. 419, presumably based on Ephorus: cf. 11, p. 422). All that he says suggests to me that the Pythia's actual utterances were now given to the enquirer: the almost total disappearance of questions on public affairs and the disuse of hexameter form would make this possible. When an Emperor consulted the oracle, some collaboration was no doubt required: so also for the oracle about Plotinus (Porph., V. Plot., 22), if that be more than a literary figment. At Claros and Didyma hexameters were used, and the answers preserved indicate deliberate thought. 13 Cf. Parke, The Delphic Oracle, 183ff. on Herodot., VII, 140ff. In considering the early history of the Delphic oracle we must not forget the smallness of the personnel: 1-3 women acting in turn as Pythia, 2 prophetai, 5 Hosioi. A. WV. Persson, Die Exegeten u. Delphi (Lunds Univ. A rsskr. N. F. I, xiv, 22, 1918), 79 suggests that some of the oracle's information was in fact due to exegetai and other local representatives; as Professor Ferguson remarks, the delegates who announced festivals must have collected much information. For a suspicion of sympathy at Dodona: Ephor. ap. Strab., IX, 2.4, p. 402. 14 Pyth. orac., 22, p. 405 C. contrasting her with those of earlier times: ib. 28, p. 408 C praises her character and apparently gives an antithesis between her normal human self-consciousness and her condition when prophesying (the text is unfortunately defective). (V, 63, 90: cf. VI, 123.2 15), and it was common belief that Cleomenes was responsible for the Pythia's decision that his rival Demaratus was illegitimate (VI, 66 16). These facts, and the remark of Demosthenes quoted earlier, were utilized by critics of the oracle: 17 and many must have been aware of such things. Never- theless, men's actions usually accorded with two assumptions: what the Pythia said must be ful- filled, and you must use your reason.18 You might ask the oracle a wrong question, and receive an answer intended to bring you to a merited disaster: you might misunderstand the answer which you received: but the answer itself, in some meaning which could be put upon it, must be fulfilled; and this applied not only to Delphi and other established oracles but also to the whole large body of predictions emanating from known seers and anonymous traditions. "And this came true," whether "this" be a prophecy or some seemingly casual saying preg- nant with ineaning, is part of the pattern of popular stories, as it is also the stuff of tragedy. The official Athenian epitaph on the citizens who fell in a battle in the middle of the fifth century concludes: "Thus he (some hero) brought his will to pass and by the warning of your hurt established for all men to take to heart in time to come the law that the fulfilment of prophecy demands their faith." 19 A little later, the chorus in Oedipus the King sang, "No more will I go reverently to earth's inviolate centre (Delphi), no more to Abae's temple or Olympia, if these oracles do not fit the issue so that all men may point to them . . . the worship of the gods is perishing" (897ff.), and the question of Oedipus, why any one should 15 Cf. W. B. Dinsmoor, Stud. Hist. Culture . . . W. G. Leland, 186; Aristotle Ath. Pol. 19.4 does not actually assert bribery. 16 Plut. Malign. Herod, 23, p. 860 D regards this as the calumnious ascription of a great impiety and fraud. 17 Cic. Div. II, 118 with A. S. Pease's note. 18 For the "use of reason" cf. Plut., Arat., 43.7 (in con- trast to believing much in sacrifices and oracles: then too, the sign was fulfilled). The use of reasoning involves in Dem., 20, a moral choice: it may be your duty to go to death, as the seer does in Herod., VII, 219, 221; Xen., Hell., II, 4, 18. Cf. n. 3; Epictet. Ench. 32.3. "9A. Cameron, Harv. Theol. Rev., XXXIII (1940), 97ff. The suggestion (ib., 128f.) that Pericles adduced a prophecy to confirm the rightness of his opposition to the expedition which ended badly may be reinforced by the story in Plut. Pericl., 13.13, of Athena revealing to him in a dream how a workman injured during the construction of the Pro- pylaea might be cured. (Aristoph., Vesp., 158ff. shows the parody of the tragic motif.)</page><page sequence="4">RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS 475 look to Delphi or to birds screaming overhead (964f.; cf. 971f.), comes but a little before the tragic vindication of the truth of these very phophecies which had seemed false. Iocasta had earlier said that she would not heed the art of divination (857f.; cf. 711, 720). The chorus, who represent normal public opinion, are shocked at the possibility of the oracle being wrong; and yet the import of the words for the hearer is not that herein lies the sin of Iocasta, or Oedipus, but that this is tragic irony; these are the words of the man or woman doomed to disaster. They are like Anna's dismissal of the idea that the dead care about the actions of the living, or Dido's mockery of heaven's plan for Aeneas- the plan which means her destruction.20 The motif of the fulfilment of prophecies and signs and omens is constant in Plutarch: and in view of his moral purpose in writing (cf. Arat., 1.5), that must represent a deliberate choice. Mantike, the art of foreknowing what to do and what must be included not only the direct utterances of Apollo or his mouthpiece and of other deities (e.g., Zeus at Dodona), but also the interpretation of signs and portents (events deemed to be out of the normal order) of visions, of the internal organs of victims sacrificed and of the flight of birds, and the use of texts sup- posedly composed by inspired seers, such as Musaeus and Bacis. All these might admit of multiple meanings between which you must choose.21 On a sign or a portent you might consult an oracle, an exegetes (or local repre- sentative of Delphi and specialist in sacred lore), or a mantis (soothsayer): on dreams, an exegetes or a mantis, and occasionally an oracle (n. 7): on victims or birds, a mantis. In the profession of mantis certain individuals and members of certain families were deemed to have special competence: but (apart from various characters of the legendary period) their competence was a matter of skill and not of inspiration, and thev differed in ability and moral qualities, just as did the possessors of other skills. Unlike the priests of civic cults, they were professionals: but they played an important part in public 20 Virg., Aen. IV, 34, 376ff. Dido can get no good out of sacrifice and divination (56ff.). Cf. in Odyssey, II, 178, the disregard by the suitors of a supernatural warning (just as Aegisthus disregarded the direct monition of Zeus con- veyed by Hermes: I, 37ff.); Soph. Antig., 1033ff. (Creon's taunt at Tiresias); Shakespeare, King John, IV, 2, 147ff., V, 1, 25ff. 21 Plut., Ages., 6.8, Pelop., 21 (you should prefer the view which did not involve human sacrifice). affairs 22 and some enjoyed considerable prestige and profit. A mantis could be a man of intel- lectual attainments: Dion had one who had studied in the Academy.23 All this involved a human factor and the Greeks frequently show their awareness of this. Even Xenophon represents the father of the elder Cyrus as having his son taught the art, in order that he should of himself know what the gods counselled and should not be at the mercy of soothsayers, if they might wish to deceive him, or helpless if without one (Cyrop., I, 6, 2). Xenophon himself suffered from the intrigue of Silanus (Anab., V, 6.17, 29).24 Portents were like signs of illness, requiring differential diagnosis: one -trouble with Nicias and his delay after the eclipse was that he had lost his good mantis,25 and Plutarch's sympathy goes only to the point of remarking that error from cautious scruple in conformity with old established opinions is better than lawless selfwill such as Crassus showed in ignoring omens (Comp. Nic. Crass., 5.3). Even here the general principles were commonplace: and certainly the examination of the entrails of victims was a matter of routine, like blood tests -but with the important difference that, as a rule, you sacrificed victims until you got favor- able omens; unless you desired otherwise.26 Ex- perts would disagree on details: but the main lines of interpretation were common property. So Xenophon says " He (Silanus) knew that, thanks to being regularly present at sacrifices, I too was not inexperienced" (A nab., V, 6.29): on a later occasion, when himself accused of persuading the soothsayer to declare the sacri- fices adverse to setting forth, he invited anyone 22Cf. Herod., VIII, 27 for a mantis as directing a cam- paign. Plut., Arat., 25.2 (a mantis is one of the leaders in a conspiracy against a tyrant): Xen., Hell., II, 4.19 (mantis rushes into the enemy's ranks). Amphiararaus as king and mantis actually fights: whether this was or was not so in historical times, a mantis does not appear to have had the sacrosanct character asserted by Paroemiographi graeci I, 134-5 ed. Leutsch-Schneidewin. In legend, the Heraclids came to disaster because they killed a mantis (W. R. Halliday, Greek Divination, 95); in fact, the Spartans imprisoned and later killed a mantis (Herod., IX, 37). In general, see M. P. Nilsson, Greek Popular Re- ligion, 125ff. [Certainly haruspices performed military service at Rome: in C. I. L., VI, 2164 one is tribune of a legion. ] 23 Plut. Dion, 22.6: 24 shows how he uised his intelligence. 24 Cf. Herod., IX, 38 for the motives of a mantis. 25 Plut., Nic., 23.7. It is to be noted that most of the army urged the generals to delay (Thuc., VII, 50). 26 Xen., Hell., IV, 2, 18 suggests the way in which things sometimes went.</page><page sequence="5">476 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK who wished to attend and any soothsayer present to inspect the sacrifices the next day, and there- after said to the troops, "As you see, the sacri- fices are not yet successful" (Annab., VI, 4.14-17). We have also records of favorable signs being pointed out to the troops in order to raise their spirits.27 Divination was comparable with ora- tory as a means of creating morale, of en- couraging the fainthearted and curbing illtimed eagerness.28 Xenophon records the bringing of victims, a mantis, food, and drink to the army (Anab., VII, 1.35): these were all necessaries, and on the monument at Delphi commemorating the victory of Aegospotami, Lysander, his sooth- sayer, and his steersman formed a group.29 To us this is transparent fiction, but it never lost its hold. Yet the general made the deci- sion,30 and in Athens Themistocles had to per- suade the people of his interpretation of the Delphic oracle about Salamis (Herod., VII, 143), just as he had to persuade them on any other disputed issue. Again, floating prophecies of Musaeus, Bacis, and other (sometimes anonymous) seers enjoyed great authority, although it was widely known or assumed that they were interpolated or in- vented. Herodotus VII, 6 relates that Ono- macritus was caught making an insertion in the oracles of Musaeus and yet (VIII, 77) he says that he cannot but believe an utterance of Bacis: here, as with the prophecies of Delphi, the idea of a vaticinium ex eventu does not seem to have crossed his mind.3' The Athenian people gave first prize to the Knights of Aristophanes, with its brilliant parodies of prophecies produced in sup- port of demagogues: but in real life, such things 27Plut., Alex., 33.2 (flight of an eagle); Polyaen., IV, 3.14 (victims). Cf. Plut., Arat., 50.5-6 (a laymen's dis- cussion of the victim's entrails). So again the interpreta- tion of dreams was a matter on which any one could talk (Plut., Pyrrh., 29.2ff.). Onasander, X, 25 insists that a general must himself be able to read the signs afforded by sacrifices, (26) that he should summon his officers to inspect them, in order that they may tell the troops to be of good heart. 28E.g., before Plataea: Herod., IX, 33-7 reads like a duel on the plane of omens. Cf. Meissner, Babylonien u. Assyrien, II, 243f. and W. Kroll, Pauly-Wissowa, IV, A, 563 on the Chaldaean soothsayer of Attalus: Frontinus, I, 12 on methods for freeing soldiers from fears caused by adverse omens, cf. 1, 11.14: Polyaen., VIII, 23.4, on fighting enemies when their soothsayers counselled against battle: for mantike as inspiring hopes cf. Thuc., V, 103: for morale in a siege, Aesch., Sept. 181ff. (with Aeneas Tacticus 10.4). 29 Pausan., X, 9.7: G. Daux, Pausanias a Delphes, 81ff. 30 Plut., Lach., 198 E. 31 M. Pohlenz, Herodot., 97. continued to influence the votes of the assembly, and no soothsayer -attacked Aristophanes as Diopeithes did Anaxagoras.32 The modernity of the Greeks must not blind us to the distance between our point of view and theirs.33 Socrates had every reason to know the influence of mundane considerations upon the Delphic oracle and the diverse factors that en- tered into divination: yet he advised Xenophon to ask the first whether he should or should not join Cyrus (Anab., III, 1.5ff.), and belief in mantike was an integral part of his theism. Plato insisted on the duty of consulting Delphi as the fountain of authority for a city's religious institution, and evolved a theology of mantike: Dion's mantis from the Academy has been men- tioned (p. 475). The line between the sup- posedly divine and the obvious human element in divination was not clear: but few save pro- fessed Cynics and Epicureans denied the former. After all, do not early Christian writers, who might so easily have chosen to regard Delphi and the other oracles and every form of divina- tion as mere human trickery, generally explain these things as due to the activity of evil dai- mones and sometimes find divine inspiration in them? In fact, some followed Hellenistic Jewish precedent and produced Sibylline utterances in support of monotheism-and even fabricated suitable responses by Apollo. As for divination, they did not find it easy to turn the faithful from its use.34 Belief in these things was deeply rooted: and yet the normative tradition of Greek classical thought did not involve a constant unqualified awe before a mysterium tremendum. Plutarch had the strongest conviction of the reality of godhead, a profound attachment to those many Greek and Egyptian myths and rites in which he found this reality enshrined, a detached atti- tude on details, and a repugnance for such popu- 32 Cf. Aristoph., Peace, 1039ff., Birds, 959ff.; Thuc., VIII, 1: Demosthenes, XIV, 25; and in general L. Rader- macher, Rhein. Mus., LIII (1898), 497ff. For the tech- nique as used at Sparta cf. Plut., Lys., 26. On Diopeithes, cf. Nilsson, 133f. 33 Professor Ferguson draws my attention, to the analogy of the Elizabethan period: an act was passed to prohibit seditious prophecies (G. L. Kittredge's edition of King Lear, viif., cf. n. 20 above), and there was active discussion of astrology, reflected in King Lear (G. C. Taylor, Philo- logical Quarterly, XX (1941), 371ff.). 34 Cf. H. C. Weiland, Het Oordeel der Kerkvaders over het Orakel (Diss. Amsterdam, 1935), and, on forged oracles, Nock, Rev. et. anc., XXX (1928).</page><page sequence="6">RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS 477 lar practices as seemed to him superstitious.35 So he says of stories of the miraculous behavior of images (Camill., 6.6) "One cannot lightly despise these tales. Yet human weakness makes it dangerous to believe greatly or to disbelieve excessively in such things": that is, let us steer a middle course between superstition and con- tempt of the divine. This is Plutarch's personal and Academic attitude: but it corresponds to the older norm of conduct. The Old Comedy mocked at soothsayers and devotees of new cults as well as at atheists: you had to use human judgment. As far as divination was concerned, this was clear, before the intellectualist movement of the fifth century had begun to exercise influence. After all, you "accepted" or did not "accept" signs and omens, and sometimes you could divert the destiny which they indicated (which is why cities and tyrants kept secret certain collections of prophecies: if divulged, these might be used by others).36 An omen was not so much an indication of inevitable destiny as a token of luck or an endorsement of policy. Were there many occasions in Greek history on which a city followed an oracular command or the advice of a mantis if it were against the inclinations of all who shaped its policies? 37 Even that model character, Hector, when Polydamas suggested that the flight of an eagle bearing a snake indi- cated that it was not wise to advance, replied that he did not care about birds, whether they fared to the right or to the left: "one omen is best, to fight for our country." To be sure, he could quote a positive counsel of Zeus: but even so the spirit is that of Nelson putting the tele- scope to his blind eye.38 Obedience whether to 35 He condemns street-corner soothsayers, etc. (Pyth. orac., 25, p. 407 C: Cic., 17.5, Lycurg., 9.5) and excessive dependence upon Chaldaeans (Mar., 42.7), Flaceliere, op. cit., 48 may be partly right in seeing here 'l'animosite du pretre d'Apollon': but a more general point of view is involved. 36 For this aspect of omens cf. Halliday, op. cit., 40ff.: Plut., Camill., 5.6 (told apologetically), Caes., 52.4f.: Augustine, Conf., IV, 2.3. 37 For instances, cf. L. Schmidt, Ethik d. alten Griechen, II, 55ff. Plut., Pyrrh., 25.3 asserts that Pyrrhus was at times inactive in deference to omens: there must have been delays for this reason. (Onasander, X, 27 regards them as necessary.) 38 JI., 12.243, quoted by Diod. Sic., XV, 52.4 (n. 3), adapted in Plut. Pyrrh., 29.4: cf. Herod., IX, 45.2, Polyaen., III, 9.8-9, [Plut.1 p. 192 E-F. Hector perished: but there is no suggestion in the Iliad that he should have paid attention to the omen: cf. n. 18. your commander or to omens is normally right: but there must be exceptions. After all, the gods were larger Greeks, and would understand. Does not Athena in Od., XIII, 296-9 appreciate the cunning of Odysseus and remark that in shrewdness she was first among immortals, and he among mortals? Again, at all times perjury was a serious thing: the breach of an oath was thought to involve fearful penalties on yourself and on your dependents-and yet, in Odyss. XIX, 395-7 (and this was one of the two epics which were thought to teach virtue), we read that Autolycus outdid all men in thievery and skill in swearing, and that the god Hermes him- self gave him this skill. Strictly speaking, this probably means " the knack of swearing an oath which deceived his adversary without being exactly a false oath "-just such an oath as is ascribed to the god in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, 379ff. (274, he offers to swear what would have been formal falsehood: but we do not know how he would have phrased the oath).39 An increasing stability and reflectiveness of living brought scruples, but the Greek retained this comparatively light touch-except when he was afraid, except when famine or plague or stress of war or a bitter sense of personal injustice con- jured spirits from the deep. Plutarch supplies several illustrations: Pyth. orac., 26, p. 407 D-E, Apollo used ambiguous language in oracles in order to protect his serv- ants from the wrath of the mighty: Pyth. orac., 20, p. 404 A, the youthful priest who had broken his vows is answered with the old line 'God allows all things that are inevitable': 40 Quomodo quis in virt. sent. prof., 12, p. 83 C, Stilpo dreamed that Poseidon was angry with him for not sacrificing an ox as was usual for priests; he was not abashed but answered "what do you say, Poseidon? Do you come complaining like a child because I did not borrow money and fill the city with the Cf. again Odyss., I, 260ff. (Athena, disguished as Mentes, tells how Odysseus wanted poison for his arrows: Ilus did not give it to him "for he stood in awe of the gods that are for ever: but my father gave it to him, for he was extravagantly fond of him"). Plut., De ser. num. vind., 7, p. 553 B refers to Autolycus as a bad character. In actual practice cf. Thuc., V, 30 (special pleading about oaths), Theophrast., ap. Plut., Nic., 10 (the lot was to determine which side should be the first to return its prisoners: Nicias by bribery caused this undesired priority to fall to the Spartans), Xen., Hell., IV, 7.2 (forcing Apollo's hand by consulting Zeus). 40 Wilamowitz, Glaube, II, 470 n. 1, Flaceli6re, op. cit., 170: cf.

The gods, like the Greeks, were sensible and not easily shocked. When Aristophanes repre- sents Prometheus hiding under a parasol, in order that Zeus might not see him, or Pisthetairos starving out the gods by cutting them off from the smoke of incense and animal offering, or Heracles being informed of testamentary dis- abilities consequent upon his illegitimacy, ex- cellent scholars are disposed to regard him as weakening popular faith. Mediaeval parallels suggest that they are wrong. There are lim- its, even for Aristophanes: no essential levitv touches the Maiden of the Acropolis or Demeter.41 Further, the poet's popularity shows that he did not give offence; and the Athenian people could take offence, and that not only at things which stirred them as deeply as did the mutilation of the Hermae and the supposed parody of the Eleusinian mysteries. Like other Greeks, they were brought up on Homer: and Homer has not only the naff folktale anthropomorphism of II., II, 1ff. (gods and men are all asleep, save Zeus, who is pondering how to honor Achilles) but also the deliberate comedv of the tale of Ares and Aphrodite, and again the mock combat of the gods in Il., XXI, which involves very dignified deities.42 Again, consider the story in Herodotus I, 60. Pisistratus was returning from exile, and a very tall woman was dressed up as Athena, and heralds sent to an- nounce " 0 Athenians, receive in kindly spirit Pisistratus, whom Athena honors above all men and is leading to her Acropolis." She entered in a chariot, and the citizens worshipped her and received Pisistratus. The truth or falsity of the 41 Cf. W. Nestle, Die griechische Religiositdt, II, 138ff. Jokes about Apollo's oracles relate to their political pro- duction and use rather than to the god: and the Birth of Athena by Hermippus was probably a satire on the myth about Zeus rather than on the goddess as worshipped, cf. A. Meineke, Fragnm. com. gr., I, 280. Nestle's argument (140f.), that old popular practice underlies the license of comedy, is important: rituals admit of a periodic release of tension. 42This distinction is due to Nestle, Neue Jahrb., XV (1905), 161ff. story does not concern us: 43 only the fact that it was told and the comment of Heroclotus "an expedient superlatively foolish" (as among Greeks, nay Athenians, and at so late a time). "The most foolish" not "the most impious" (contrast II, 121e). Herodotus expresses vari- ous moral judgments (Pohlenz, Herodot, 92f.), and of course his silence does not imply approval: but here he comments-on the stupidity in- volved, not on any wickedness imputed to the friends of Pisistratus and Megacles. Anyone caught by such a trick deserved what heppened to him; and it was stupid to try it, if it was tried.44 The tale of the sacred snake leaving the Acropolis in 480, given in Herodotus, VIII, 41 as a plain fact, is thus recorded in Plut., Themist., 10: "At this point, Themistocles, in despair of winning the multitude by human reasonings, arranged something like a deus ex machina andi brought before them supernatural signs and oracles" (cf. ib., 19.4 the statement that the early kings of Attica were credited with invent- ing the story of the contest between Poseidon and Athena in order to wean the population from sea to land: Numa, 4.11-2 "Nor is there anv- thing wrong about the other story told of Ly- curgus and Numa and other such men to the effect that mastering as they were multitudes hard to control and hard to please, and intro- ducing great changes in constitutions, they arro- gated to themselves the reputation of divine aid, to the benefit of the very men before whom they acted the part " 45). The fabrication of oracles in the fifth century for political purposes has been noted earlier (p. 476): we mav add that when Oedipus taunts Tiresias with having bought, and Creon with having bought him, he does not accuse either of impiety.46 Here per- sonal or political interest was involved: we lhave 43 H. J. Rose, Class. Quart., XXXIV [1940], 81f., gives an attractive explanation. 44 Aristotle puts it thus (Ath.

Of course there were limits to justifiable ma- nipulation: the madness of Cleomenes was widely regarded as divine punishment for his Delphic intrigue (p. 474, above).48 But in general, we seem to see a feeling that the gods were Hellenic and sensible, as men could and should be. Long before Protagoras, man was the measure of all things: and a Greek did not scruple to admit the motive of philotimia, the desire to make a good showing before men, in his liberalities to the gods and their temples: Plutarch imputes it to one who was thought "dear to the gods," the right- eous Nicias.49 The Greek had no desire to Do good by stealth and blush to find it fame: no sympathy with the maxim enunciated in Matthew 6.2-3 50 or with Rabbinic exhortations 47Cf. A. Bouche-Leclercq, Hist. divination grecque, III, 123; Nock, Conversion, 97; A. M. Tozzer, Landa's Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan, 109, n. 500; and, in earlier times, the attribution to the Pythia of the ipsissima verba of the official hexameters (n. 12: cf. Tac., Ann., II, 54.4 on the priest at Claros); and the wording of Herod., VIII, 41.2 " the Athenians say these things (that a great snake guards the Acropolis and dwells in the temple), and they set monthly offerings before it as before something actually existing: the monthly offering is a honey cake. This cake, which heretofore was always consumed, was on this occasion untouched." 48 Herod., VI, 75 (VI, 84.3 speaks simply of C. as paying the penalty due to Demaratus, i.e. atoning for the human injustice and not the sacrilege). Cf. Thuc., V, 16; Plut., Lys., 25.3 (L. failed), Diod., XIV, 13.3ff.; the legend in Diog. Laert., V, 91, discussed by Parke, Delphic Oracle, 418f. Cass.

Klostermann's note. to give alms secretly: philotimia was a commonly accepted and expressed motive for charity.5' arete meant not only the fact but also the recog- nition of excellence. Further, the gods could be called citizens (Aesch., Sept., 253): their cults were part of the fabric of civic life, and the upkeep of these cults was a civic obligation. The sense of self-importance and the desire for recognition are constant factors in human life, and find expression in a wide range of religious and secular activities 52: in most societies there is what W. I. Thomas calls a "pattern of dis- tiriction." Competitiveness for prestige marked the Greek, whether in the rigorous self-discipline of Sparta or in the self-expression of developed Athens.53 Much of what can be said about the religion of any one nation or culture can be said about many others: for religion is largely determined by the human situation, and in considerable measure this is a constant. Greek religion, how- ever, has a definite idiosyncrasy, and this be- comes clearer when we turn to the contrast of republican Rome 54 and of the Near East. On the days which belonged to the gods, dies nefasti, the Roman approached them as numina, forces operating according to laws and not beings whose conduct could be guessed on human probability (eikos): everything was done with juristic pre- cision, according to rituals, inherited in a gens or prescribed by permanent bodies called collegia. These collegia were deemed to possess an un- disputed right to determine what might and might not be done: they granted dispensations, where a Greek might have taken them. (Neither Greek nor Roman would have died rather than 51 H. Bolkestein, Wohltatigkeit u. Armnenpflege im vor- christlichen Altertum, 152ff., 318. 52 Cf.

Plut., Marc., 5.7 ascribes "precision without superstition" to the Romans: this lay in strict conformity with ancestral usage (as distinct from anxious interest in new scruples or rites).-The exegetai at Athens had functions and tenure out of which something like the collegium pontificum might have developed, but did not.</page><page sequence="9">480 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK commit anything like a breach of the sabbath, but would they not have had different ways out of the difficulty?) 55 One of these collegia con- sulted a collection of prophecies, the Sibylline books, but the public was normally told the decisions of the collegium and of the Senate, not the words of the Sibyl. A magistrate who held imperium possessed auspicia (both words which resemble numen in having no precise Greek equivalent), the right and luck of consulting the gods for their approval. He had attendants, but their r8le was hardly more than that of technicians; they had not the independent per- sonality- of the Greek mantis. The magistrate acted as he saw fit, but almost always behind the screen of a completely maintained legal fiction: 56 and he too decided not as an individual, but as the possessor of imperium and auspicia, as one of those whose conduct of public affairs was chronicled without name by the elder Cato. Criticism and discussion had no part in the native scheme of things. Rome's rise to world power and the impact of Hellenistic thought involved a more critical and reflective attitude, and even the elder Cato made his joke about haruspices (Cic., Div., I, 51): in the next century Cicero states a strong case against the theoretical validity of divination, but was no more ready than Cato to consider the possibility of the sys- tem being abandoned. When Augustus sought to rehabilitate the Roman virtues, he necessarily set himself to restore temples and rituals (and I may remark in passing that his enterprise cannot be pronounced a failure: the ruling class regained a sense of responsibility). From the Roman standpoint, religious philo- timia also was out of the question. Rome had its gloria, the concomitant of eminent services to the state 57: but the foundation of temples was the work of magistrates acting within prescribed formulas, and their maintenance was public. Certain families had hereditary ritual obliga- tions, but the idea of private munificence in this area does not appear before Horace, Sat., II, 2.103ff.; in other words, not before a time when the old order was shaken to its foundations. 5 Cf. Plutarch's comments on the taking of Jerusalem on a sabbath (Superst., 8, p. 169 C). 56 Cic., Div., I, 27, II, 72-3, 77. The Greek mantis also had to yield to the general (n. 30). 57 U. Knoche, Philol., LXXXIX (1934), 102ff. The earlier Roman ideal is summarized by Q. Metellus in Plin., Nat. Hist., VII, 139f. To speak very generally, the measure of things in Greece is man, in Rome is law. and in the Near East is the gods-or the gods and a monarchy which is their instrument. These gods were after the fashion, if not always after the form, of men, and the stories told of them. even in the canonical text of ritual hymn and drama, include not only allegory and inventive elaboration but also (as did the cult) elements which seem to us undignified and even worse.58 Yet the stories are, it seems, almost wholly the work of priesthoods, the prime repositories of tradition and learning. Biologically and emotionally the members of a priesthood are not a race apart from their fellow-nationals nor are they devoid of individualism and personal ambition,59 but their responses are strongly conditioned by their training and likely to be in large part conven- tional; when treating myth, they can seldom stand outside the tradition and look at it in an individualistic way. Our evidence may be mis- leading: we have what priests and scribes pre- served, and even the protests of Zoroaster and prophets and psalmists against elements or exag- gerations of cult have survived in formularies,60 while our knowledge of the layman hardly goes beyond expressions of personal devotion and moral reflectiveness. Nevertheless, the very fact of what was preserved shows what was normative: though we now have from Egypt a literary pastiche on the tale of Horus and Seth,6' 58 Cf. J. A. Montgomery, J. Am. Or. Soc., LXII (1942), 49ff. (dramatic text from Ras Shamra: the old god taunted by his wives, and the birth of two voracious sons); Br. Meissner, Babylonien u. Assyrien, II, 178 (the gods eat and drink to excess, cf. Indra in the Rig Veda); L. R. Farnell, Greece and Babylon, 173 (the gods in a panic), 243 (gods swarm like flies around the sacrifice), 83 ("to whom the very gods offer prayers"); M. Pieper, Z. agypt. Spr., LXX (1934), 94 (on the way in which in an Egyptian Mdrchen the gods are deceived and allow Truth to be blinded). 5 Babylonian and Egyptian experts in divination may have had as much ambition as Greek experts (cf. the self- description of a dignitary expert in occult arts published by G. Daressy, Ann. serv. Eg., XVI (1916), lff., or the so-called Babylonian of Propert. IV, 1): but they differed in belonging to hierarchic corporations. 60 If there is an element of satire in Rig Veda, VII, 103, it is incidental and not primary: cf. A. B. Keith, Religion and Philosophy of the Veda, 302, 434. (Mr. D. H. Ingalls has remarked to me that the humor which we find in the comparison of frogs and priests is partlv due to our memory of Aristophanes.) 61 A. H. Gardiner, The Library of A. Chester Beatty.

Further, the cults were rich, in their own pos- sessions and in royal gifts: the ordinary man paid to them what he must needs in tithe or the equivalent, but there was no place for liberality, philotimia, save on the part of civil and religious potentates, in their ordained hieratic r6les: 64 for others conformity sufficed, and specially good repute was gained by benevolence to the poor and the unburied dead rather than by services to the cult.65 The Greek attitudes which we have considered are very far from Christianity, very far from Ethical Culture: they were already very far from Plato and the philosophic tradition, within which a wholly different notion of divinity de- veloped. Yet they existed side by side with deep feelings of dependence and devotion and Ramesses V; this has the quality of secular literature, and Gardiner adduces parallels: the Egyptian clergy may have had men capable of writing a counterpart to Goliardic songs, but the tale certainly was written for entertainment, not for ritual. We have also late Demotic and Greek accounts of the story of Tefnut (R. Reitzenstein-W. Cronert-W. Spiegelberg, Sitzungsb. Heidelberg, 1923, ii): Spiegelberg, Sitzungsb. Berlin, 1915, 888 regards this tale as written originally by priests for priestly circles and then remodelled into a popular tale, also (890) as possibly acted. -Egyptians, Babylonians and Persians looked at their tradition from the outside for one purpose, to explain it to Greeks, to link their temples to stories familiar to the visitors, to make their own myths and rites at once in- telligible and suitably mysterious. 62 Contrast the Greek adaptation of some pre-Greek sacred names and stories with the continued use in Meso- potamia of the language and actual wording of Sumerian texts. For other differences, cf. L. R. Farnell, Greece and Babylon. 63 Egypt has new myths invented to legitimize magical proceedings, but they follow old patterns and probably emanate from the lower clergy. 64 The Jews made voluntary gifts to the Temple, in addition to paying temple dues; this may go back to the return from exile; certainly a pious Jew was not likely to take the Temple for granted, as an Egyptian or Babylonian might do with his shrines. 0 At least in Egypt (J. Baillet, Le regime pharaonique dans ses rapports avec l'6volution de la morale en Egypte, 469ff.). awe. "0 Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children," said the Egyptian priest in Plato's Timaeus [22B]: but children, though they may sound irreverent, are afraid of the dark and glad of the light, capable of passionate attachment to those who feed and guard them, those to whom they take their little troubles and grievances, those who to them represent something like omniscience and omnipotence, capable, again, of a sense of guilt and awe before those who represent also the order of commands which may not be broken. In the Ion of Euripides, Creusa speaks of Apollo as one who has done her a brutal violence, and yet the young hero's attitude to the god and the Delphic shrine is like that of an unspoiled novice in a cloister enriched with the devotion of the ages. "All men have need of the gods," says Nestor (Odyss., III, 48); and the Zeus, who could be represented in so undignified a manner, was also the natural pro- tector of the stranger and the suppliant, the god who "pours forth rain most violently, being in wrath and anger against men who judge crooked judgments by force in the assembly, and drive justice out, and heed not the vengeance of the gods" (II., XVI, 385ff.). Something like the spirit of Old Testament prophecy exists side by side with the Ovidian tale. Man was the mea- sure: but what he sought to measure seemed greater than himself. The gods were larger Greeks: yes, but between gods and man there was a line. " Do not seek to become a god ": you might be honored as a god, but you remained a man, and any gesture that suggested forgetful- ness of this, any " frantic boast and foolish word " might draw on you that supernatural resentment, whether ethical or beyond good and evil, which the Greeks called Envy or Nemesis, the tragic penalty of greatness in sagas and Herodotean tales. You walked proudly in the sun: but, says Cephalus in Plato, Rep., I, 330 D-E, "When a man is near the point of thinking that he will die, there comes upon him fear and reflection on matters which did not trouble him before. The stories told about things in Hades, to the effect that the man who has done wrong here must pay the penalty there, those stories at which he used to mock, trouble his spirit then,-lest they may be true." There was fear, on a higher level and on a lower. The Greek disapproved of magic and witchcraft: yet Plato, Laws, XI, p. 933 D, clearly indicates how difficult it would have been to eradicate the fear of them from men's minds,</page><page sequence="11">482 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK and archaeological evidence shows that such pro- ceedings were used by men of wealth and posi- tion.66 These considerations make it easier to under- stand the Greek attitude towards oracles and divination: the human element in these things was seen, and yet the results seemed to vindicate them. We must not look for consistency in men s religious actions, any more than in their secular conduct: norms of belief and facts of practice, words and deeds do not fit: nor do men mean all that they say, in reverence or irrev- erence, least of all men as nimble of wit and tongue as were many of the Greeks. Religion is not all or nothing, certainly not among them. I" Nilsson, Greek Popular Religion, 114f. The Homeric pattern and the disciplined life of the small Greek city states in the archaic period supplied a norm: the land of Greece, physical conditions with singular clarity of at- mosphere and yet a certain capricious quality, unlike the massive regularity of Egypt and Meso- potamia, and experienced with special sharp- ness by the many who lived in contact with the sea: the Greeks themselves, a kaleidoscopic vari- ety of pattern against a common background. So we find a religion of laymen with a respect for tradition and a strong strain of that common- sense which is superior to intellectualism. In religion, as in other things, classical Hellenism represents a delicate balance which defies our attempts at formulation.</page></plain_text>
