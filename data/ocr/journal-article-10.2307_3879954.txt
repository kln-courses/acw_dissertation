This is an ambitious, complex, and erudite book based on the author's 1998 dissertation at the University of Lausanne and following some of the same lines of inquiry as Johann Christoph Bilrgel's provocative essays in The Feather of Simurgh (1988). La podtique de la peinture en Iran combines literary and pictorial analysis, takes on the important and little studied issue of the conceptual links between Persian literature and Persian painting, and aims at nothing less than an interpretation of the philosophical and theoretical underpinings of both verbal and visual production in Iran during the medieval through early modern periods. Lamei' divides his study into three parts. The first and longest section begins with a structural analysis of the passage in Nizami's Sharafnama (the first part of the Iskandarnama in the poet's Khamsa) that recounts the dialogue about the nature of painting between Iskandar and the Khaqan of Chin, and their debate as to whether the Greeks or the Chinese were superior in the art of pictorial representation. A contest then ensued between a Greek painter, who painted an image on a vaulted wall, and a Chinese painter, who polished his vault to create a mirror reflection of the Greek painting. This "concours des peintres et des miroitiers" concludes with Iskandar's judgement that the Greek artist excelled in painting (saratgari) while the Chinese excelled in polishing (saygal). Lamei" leads us through this well-known text , both in the Persian original and in French translation, virtually line by line and word by word, with a discussion of Nizami's narrative progression and themes. His detailed and subtle "explication de texte" concludes with a diagrammatic scheme to prove that Nizami constructed his poem according</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 187 to a numerical system. Lamei" then applies the same rigorous analysis to two other versions of the "dialogue between the Greeks and the Chinese," one by Maulavi (Mawlana Jala al-Din Rumi) and the other by Amir Khusrau Dehlavi. The purpose of this comparison is to underscore the greater appeal of Nizami's poem, in which painting is accorded the same metaphorical status and value as poetry-thus explaining why Persian artists preferred illustrating the Nizami version to those of the other two poets. Having established Nizami's primacy as the inspiration for Persian painters, Lamei then turns to a discussion of five known illustrations of the Greek-Chinese competition in different vol- umes of the Khamsa dating from the mid-15th through the early 16th century. All five composi- tions depict the contest's final stage, when the two artists have completed their work and Iskandar sits in judgement on the results. Here again, Lamei's concern is as much with the literary and thematic as the iconographic and compositional, and his analysis involves the treat- ment and meaning of specific motifs, such as the curtain that separates the two competitors, featured in four of the illustrations, and the human- and animal-headed rinceau, similar to the waq-waq motif that dominates the fifth painting. Regrettably, Lamei does not offer any synthe- sis or conclusion to his discourse on these illustrations, except to note that each example pro- vides an "ingenious and original interpertation" of Nizami's story. If the truth be told, none of the illustrations in the author's corpus belongs among the masterpieces of Persian painting, and their painters, more competent than gifted, would seem to have relied more on artistic convention rather than innovation in the representation of these scenes. In Part 2, Lamei broadens his joint interrogation of the literary and pictorial with further discussion of Nizami. Under the rubric "L'Amour et l'art," he pursues a wide range of fascinat- ing topics, from the relationship between poetry and metallurgy and Nizami's role as an alche- mist and as a poet-painter to the metaphorical significance of various images in the Khamsa, including Khusrau's seal (mohr), Farhad's steel pick (palad), and the mirror and the sword, as well as seated poses. Portraiture also receives considerable attention, including three portraits of Khusrau in landscape settings, Sultan Mahmud looking at the portrait of Ayaz, and Shirin contemplating the portrait of Khusrau. An important point that emerges from all this is Nizami's preoccupation with the practices and language of painting and sculpture and even his self- identity as a painter. Besides Nizami, Lamef's reading of poetic-cum-pictorial imagery is in- formed by the works of other Iranian/Persian literary and cultural figures, from the 14th-century poet Rami to the 20th-century filmmaker 'Abbas Kiya-Rostami. In the conclusions to parts 1 and 2, the author states that his exploration of the "multiple and complex relations between texts and images in illustrated manuscripts of the 14th to 16th century" is intended to demonstrate the long and rich tradition of Iranian art theories and the reciprocal relations between painted pictures and written texts. Although Lamei seems to be unaware of the growing recognition among historians of Islamic and Persian art of the close integration between the arts of poetry, painting, and calligraphy (as broached, for instance, by Oleg Grabar in La peinture persane: Une introduction [1999]), it is good to have his further evidence of the prestige of painting in medieval and later Iranian culture. Likewise, it is valu- able to be reminded, especially through such meticulous textual analysis, of the "cosmic con- ception" of Persian painting, so beloved of French and francophone scholarship, and of its grounding in Iranian philosophical, mystical, and poetic rhetoric. The third and final part of this publication is titled "Appendix," suggesting its function as a supplement to the two preceding sections. In fact, it is at once central to the author's interpre- tation of Nizami's account of the competition between the Greek and Chinese painters as a manifestation of Iranian art theory and a totally independent, and quite compelling, topic within the present study. Here Lamei discusses eight terms or bases (although he introduces them as sept fondements) relating to the classification of and techniques for figurative styles in 16th- century Iran. His principal source is the Safavid poet 'Abdi, whose mathnavrs feature these</page><page sequence="3">188 Int. J. Middle East Stud. 35 (2003) terms in descriptions of the buildings and gardens at the court of Shah Tahmasp. Most of 'Abdi's language-or the words' underlying concepts-is familiar, with words such as eslTFm (translated as "islamique"), xatayt (of Cathy, or Chinese), farangT (European), abr (cloud), band-e ramr (interlace), and vaq (plants with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic heads), while others expand the theoretical range for our understanding of how Persian writers conceived visual forms: fassalT (narrative painting) and ntrlafar (waterlily). Of greatest consequence here is Lamei's discussion of the metaphorical nature of these terms and their visual equivalence in contemporary Persian painting. With cAbdi, Lamei also returns to a notion he introduces at the outset of his study: the metaphorical relations or ties (liens) between architecture and the illustrated book. Thus, for instance, the principal palace entrances are comparable to a manuscript frontispiece. Also at issue here are the relations between the poet who composes a text and the king who commis- sions a palace. As he says at the conclusion of the Appendix, this area of investigation could be pursued further to strengthen our understanding of the conceptual bonds between literature and painting in Iran. It is to be hoped that Lamei' himself might take up this challenge and build on the important groundwork he has laid in La poetique de la peinture en Iran. But in so doing, he might wish to bring his familiarity with Persian painting (especially its historical development) in line with his evident expertise in Persian literature, so that the poetic conception of Persian painting can really be appreciated. He also would do well to take note of recent work on Persian aesthetics by Grabar and David Roxburgh, among others. Then he might actually achieve a study that would be of enormous benefit to a broad range of scholars in Iranian culture studies, one that truly balances the value of Persian poetry for Persian painting-and vice versa.</page></plain_text>
