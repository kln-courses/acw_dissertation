<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger Roderick J. Mcintosh and Susan Keech Mcintosh Introduction By entitling his 1970 popularization Les Siecles Obscurs de l'Afrique Noire, Raymond Mauny invoked a tradition of using a one-word, widely-understood referrant for those centuries of 'history without texts' before c. AD 1600 (Mauny 1970: 7, see Maes 1924: 37). Because of the paucity of traditional documentation, the African past would remain obscur, hidden and unnoticed, until the hope of archaeology was realized (1970: 282). Mauny would certainly have lamented with Murdock that '.. . the spade of archaeology . . . has thus far lifted perhaps an ounce of earth on the Niger for every ton carefully sifted on the Nile' (1959: 73). But obscur was freighted with a darker meaning. Murdock was virtually alone in predicting that carefully sifted Niger earth would reveal empires comparable to Egypt in 'complexity of culture and the richness of life' (1959: 73). For most scholars, Middle Niger landscape was not just hidden, but was undistinguished and humble (COFD: 578) in its prehistoric achievements. Some, purely on botanical grounds, fully expected an agricultural revolution to have occurred along the Niger. But few would have credited West Africa with any of the other Childeian revolutions (progressive transformations culminating in urban or state demographics - Childe 1950: 3). For Mauny, change itself was arrested by the sands of the desert, which blocked sub-saharan Africa from 'centers of radiation' to the north and east (1970: 76). As he saw it, the Arabs were responsible for ending the long isolation of West African societies which had reached a level comparable to Halstatt (early Iron Age) in the Sahara and western Sudan, but which were scarcely out of the neolithic in the forest (Mauny 1961: 541). Ironically, archaeology has not as yet provided the expected evidence of a food production revolution, but has demonstrated the precocious and largely indigenous nature of Middle Niger urbanism, trade and stable complex society. After a brief precis of what we consider to be the compelling issues in current West African research, we demonstrate that work since 1970 in the Middle Niger represents radical revisions of knowledge and research paradigms. We follow with speculation about the future promises of Middle Niger research (Figure 1). World Archaeology Volume 20 No. 1 Archaeology in Africa ?

Geomorphology and domestication Current West African research benefits from reconstructions of palaeoclimate since c. 30,000 BP with a chronological resolution of &lt; 1000 years. Figure 2 is assembled from studies of lake deposits (Maley 1981, Petit-Maire 1986b, Street and Grove 1979, Talbot and Delibrias 1980) and aeolian features (Grove and Warren 1968, Talbot 1980). From these data emerge models of the effect on climate of changes in sea level and temperature, the Jet Stream, and Arctic or Antarctic glaciation (Berger 1981b, Flohn and Nicholson 1980, Rognon 1976). Parallel efforts reveal ultimate mechanisms of climate change (such as orbital eccentricities or solar cycles) that underly periodicities in past and future climate, such as 30 year humid-dry cycles illustrated in Figure 2 (Berger 1981a, Faure and Gac 1981, Kutzbach and Otto-Bliesner 1982). No less important, however, are the regional studies that refine the generalized sequence and that allow modelling of human response at different time scales (Butzer 1983, Lauer and Frankenberg 1980, Petit-Maire 1986a). Potentially, domestication was one possible response to climatic stress in Holocene West Africa. It has long been theorized that an array of food crops (and perhaps cattle) were domesticated in West Africa, but little evidence exists as yet (Harlan and Stemler</page><page sequence="3">From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger 143 frl Faire &amp; sac 1981: Fig Ao 19o 1920 940 1960 19809 2000 12o000 09o00 A rpsemlt ac:ntvry _ . *&gt;**- * i ) *1/ '/ ---' 19 18 17 It i5 14 13 (2 it 20.,00 BP I o, I 100 9 8 7 6 5.0001 It l l l / i0i I I I 1113 25 33 41 56 64 75 3800 340 12800 00 04 10 140D0 00- 400 31000 2 pO0 IpO O 4.000 0BP Key HUMID ARID ........... ......

Food production was thought to be the exception to the general expectation that Late Stone Age (LSA) populations were on the whole rather passive recipients of innovations developed elsewhere (e.g., J. G. D. Clark 1971). For the past two decades conceptions of Holocene LSA populations were dominated by the 'aqualithic' adaptation (Sutton 1974) or Saharo- Sudanese Neolithic (Camps 1974) constructs that emphasized cultural conservatism and homogeneity. We now recognize enormous variability in LSA adaptation. The challenge is to define the local responses to stress and opportunities created by oscillating drying conditions in the last millennia BC. Not surprisingly, the earliest evidence of domesticated grains, from Karkarichinkat South at 4000-3500 BC (Smith 1983) and Tichitt at 2900-2100 BC (Munson 1976, Holl 1985), comes from detailed contexts which encourage hypotheses about seasonality and scheduling. Research over the past decade along the Middle Niger, a vast (&gt;120,000km2) floodplain of surficial pseudodeltaic hydrology, has been conducted with an eye to modelling human response to changing environmental conditions through time. Figure 3 reconstructs the gross characteristics of the Middle Niger basins at various periods. Different areas offer varying potential for research on the question of plant domesti- cation. The Mema, Azawad or Saharan corridors are prime regions for those subscribing to a 'stress' model for plant domestication (Chevalier 1938). The southern basins have always been favoured by those inclined towards contemporary areas of primary genetic variation (Harlan 1971, Porteres 1950 and 1976).

McIntosh and Susan Keech McIntosh has been a disappointment for those expecting to find a centre for African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and fonio (Digitaria exilis) domestication (Murdock 1959, Porteres 1950 and 1976). Part of the problem, surely, is that only two Middle Niger research projects report systematic collection of plant remains. The Doupwil and Galia sites in the upper Delta yield domestic rice, fonio, and millet throughout the strata, as would be expected of sites founded in the early 12th century AD (Bedaux et al. 1978: 170-180). At Galia fonio and rice predominate, whereas at Doupwil millet constitutes 89% of the samples. Bedaux attributes this to different ethnic groups with specialized economies. At Jenne-jeno, domesticated rice, sorghum (probably Sorghum bicolor) and millet are present in the earliest (c. 250 BC) levels (J. Harlan and J. Scheuring: pers. comm.)

The first permanent settlers of the upper Delta were not experimenting with new foods; they arrived with the fruit of experiments already completed elsewhere, but just where remains a mystery. Throughout the Jenne-jeno sequence one finds a 'generalized' constellation of rice, sorghum, millet, a variety of local wild grasses, domestic cow and dwarf goat, a variety of wild bovids, and the same fish eaten in Jenne today (S. and R. McIntosh 1979, K. Cruz-Uribe and R. Travers: pers. comm.). Insights into major social transformations can be obtained by working backwards in time through the palaeoclimatic sequence, complemented by observations on settlement pattern. After AD 1100, a greatly reduced population abandoned ideal rice-producing soils near Jenne-jeno in preference for high sandy features (levees and dunes) (R. McIntosh 1983). This movement may have been accelerated later by the penetration of martial, millet-growing Bambara (Gallais 1967, Monteil 1903). Numerous large sites in the Timbuktu area apparently were abandoned at this period also (S. and R. McIntosh 1986). The Middle Niger evidence apepars to parallel that from elsewhere in West Africa of a period of climatic decline in the early second millennium AD, involving significant lake regressions, drought and dramatic population movements (Brooks 1986, Nicholson 1980). Humid conditions increased in the first millennium AD, and were pronounced from c. 700-1100 (Nicholson 1980). This is the epoch of regional prosperity and mature urbanism at Jenne-jeno. Elsewhere along the Middle Niger, the 'industrial' production of iron (requiring great amounts of wood fuel) begins in the latter part of the first millennium in the Mema (Haaland 1980). Iron smelting sites are also associated with the high tells of the Lakes Region, only one of which - Soumpi - has been excavated to date (Raimbault and Sidibe n.d.). Calibrated dates of AD 200-800 (M. Raimbault: pers. comm.) for the entire ten-metre sequence at Soumpi suggest an intense occupation resulting in rapid accumulation. On the Niger Bend, many large permanent settlements dating to the late first millennium AD flank the wadis traversing the dune fields north of the Niger. These wadis served as embayments filled by far higher and longer Niger floods or they held ponds supported by a far higher subterranean water table (S. and R. McIntosh 1986). Prior to AD 500, occupation is ephemeral on the Niger Bend, a situation that contrasts strongly with the upper Delta and Macina, where the floruit of rural occupation around Dia dates to 300 BC-AD 500. The Dia hinterland is depopulated soon thereafter. Near Jenne, steady growth in numbers and size of settlements from 300 BC leads to full urbanism at c. AD 500. These events come at a time of increased aridity elsewhere in West Africa. If large parts of the Niger floodplain were permanent lake or swamp with water-borne infestation spread as far north as 15?N before 300 BC (Brooks 1986, Smith 1979), a formerly uninviting Middle Niger would have become attractive to new colonists. Lower, shorter floods would have facilitated initial occupation of these deep basins. The absence of LSA finds except along the very northern and northwestern peripheries (Kobadi and Boulel in the Mema, rare surface scatters in the Lakes Region and, abundantly, in the Azawad) supports this reconstruction (Guitat 1972, Petit-Marie and Riser 1983, Raimbault 1986). These developments follow a long trend since c. 4500 BP of generally decreasing, but</page><page sequence="6">146 Roderick J. McIntosh and Susan Keech Mcintosh highly oscillatory rainfall and lake levels which saw important movements of Saharan peoples north, east and south. Two current uncertainties about the evolution of the Middle Niger pertain directly to the archaeological questions of human penetration of the Middle Niger and plant domestication. (1) Tricart (1959, 1965) postulated the presence of a vast Lake Paleo-Debo submerging much of the southern Middle Niger until c. 1000 BC. Others believe that channel migration or rapid alluviation may simply have erased the evidence of temporary LSA camps (Jacobberger 1987, R. McIntosh 1983). (2) Relict channels lead from the Niger to former lake beds far in the central Sahara (Furon 1929, Kervran 1959, Palausi 1955, Urvoy 1942), prompting debate as to whether these would have presented naturally ponding corridors for LSA peoples moving out of the expanding desert, as appears to be documented in the case of the Tilemsi Valley (S. and R. McIntosh 1983, Petit-Maire 1986b, Smith 1979, Talbot 1980). The future promises liberation from a too literally linear conception of Saharan peoples 'fleeing' desiccation. The vision of refugees carrying a conservative material culture baggage, pushing into virgin lands, encouraged earlier researchers to ask limited questions of their date (e.g., Davies 1966 and 1967). With sophisticated models of seasonality, and mobility (Butzer 1982, Clark 1980) we can take advantage of improved palaeoecological data. Smith (1979, 1984), for example, conceives of LSA occupation of Saharan corridors such as the Tilemsi in terms of fluid waves propelled north or south in response to shifting seasonal resources (especially pasturage) or disease vectors. The drastic climatic oscillations of c. 4500-2500 BP may have detonated a virtual explosion of experimentation, reinforcement to change and communication about successful innovations. The Middle Niger's riverine setting probably amplified the effects of information expansion or monopoly (R. and S. McIntosh 1981: 21). What were the implications for urbanism and emergence of social complexity of an apparent dramatic diminution of trans-Saharan and intra-Saharan contact (Brooks 1986) during the 300 BC-AD 300 explosion of population and settlement in the Middle Niger? As lines of communication shift from multiple anastomosing distributaries of the Niger (AD 300-1100, 1500-1630) to concentration along single channels, such as occurred at the beginning of extended drought periods (Jacobberger in press), are the opportunities for a few favoured localities enhanced? Climatic oscillations at different time scales change the nature of communication, as well as resource availability, and thus make persistent contributions to changes in scale in the organization of Middle Niger society and production. Organization of society and production Current West African research has only recently been unshackled from the 'Arab stimulus' paradigm. In its purest form, this model supposed that much of the impetus for the development of West African complex societies came from outside stimulation of the indigenous economy as North African Arabs initiated, in the eighth century AD, trans-Saharan trade for gold and slaves. As commercial networks were established in the Western Sudan, local control of commodity production or transport encouraged the</page><page sequence="7">From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger 147 formation of chiefdoms and their integration into large-scale states, characterized by their 'economic and cultural dependence upon Islamic North Africa' (Mauny 1961: 15) (Bovill 1968, Levtzion 1973). Cities or states in the forest were expected to be more recent, and less obviously derivative of Mediterranean prototypes than those in the Sahel. As we have argued in the case of West African urbanism (S. and R. McIntosh 1984, see Connah 1987: 102-3), adherence to this model consigned archaeology to the almost trivial role of verifying towns, states or sources of luxury trade items mentioned in the Arab sources. The historical paradigm continues to animate research at the entrepot cities of Azugi, Tegdaoust and Koumbi Saleh, the last site being particularly important for an understanding of the Empire of Ghana's impact on the Middle Niger (S. and R. McIntosh 1984). Elsewhere, hints of a more spectacular pre-Arab past had been accumulating. If the growing evidence was still ambiguous at the time Les Siecles Obscurs went to press, it is considerably less so now. In the first millennium AD, the practice of building massive funerary tumuli containing richly appointed burials became common in Senegal as well as along the Niger Bend (Descamps 1979; Martin and Becker 1974). Further south in Senegal, megalithic monuments are widely distributed (Descamps 1981; Gallay et al. 1981; Thilmans et al. 1980). Too few of these have been excavated to know how these monuments and the burial rituals they represent became elaborated through time, but radiocarbon dates suggest that the origins of both lie deep in the first millennium AD. Along the middle Senegal River, large tells associated with specialized iron-smelting had also appeared by the end of the first millennium (Chavane 1985, Thilmans and Ravise 1980; Robert-Chaleix and Sognane 1983). At Igbo Ukwu in the Nigerian forest, the discovery of a burial chamber with stunning funerary appointments cast in bronze, as well as thousands of glass and carnelian beads also suggests the emergence of highly stratified societies (Shaw 1970 and 1977). With the origin of the carnelian thought to be India, it is clear that Igbo Ukwu was able to attract substantial numbers of exotics from considerable distances. The four ninth-century radiocarbon dates for Igbo Ukwu were initially dismissed as centuries too early for such trade contacts to have reached the forest, but the dates have gained acceptance in light of the growing evidence for extensive pre-Arab trade in West Africa. Artistic and metallurgical reconsideration of the cire perdu bronzes points persuasively to an indigenous origin for both the metal and the technology at Igbo Ukwu (Craddock and Picton 1986). Further west in the Nigerian forest, there is good evidence that Ife was established for several centuries before the 'classic' period of brass and terracotta sculptures plus potsherd pavements, now convincingly dated to the 12th-15th centuries (Shaw 1981). The available dates for these developments are too early, and the monuments and settlements too mature and underived to sustain the 'Arab stimulus' paradigm. Yet, demonstration of the local context of development has eluded research in most of these cases. Middle Niger research provides a corrective. The Middle Niger represents the only unambiguous in situ regional context for indigenous transformation to complex society, accessible largely through the continuous 1600 year sequence at Jenne-jeno, now supplemented by a similar sequence of at least a millennium at the Macina site of Shoma.

The early period (c. 250 BC to AD 300) covers the founding of the site by immigrant iron-using peoples and its subsequent rapid expansion to at least 25 hectares. Jenne-jeno and all satellite settlements were at maximum size by the end of the next period, AD 800 (Figure 5). Jenne-jeno and neighbouring Hambarketolo had by that time merged into a total area of 41 hectares, much of which was enclosed by a massive city wall. Shoma, too, had a city wall at this time. Jenne-jeno's mid-first millennium urban status is affirmed in the first instance by a consistent pattern in excavated materials of elaborate 'corporate' specialization and diversification (discussed further below). Further, hinterland sites are arranged by size in a classic 'mature urban' rank-size pattern (Berry 1961, Crumley C0 Q, 200 100 AD 50 0 BC 50 100 200 300 400 500 600</page><page sequence="9">From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger 149 0 b Kaniana \0, 2.0 30 4.0km t?o ancient sites * villages Figure 5 Expansion of Jenne-jeno and distribution of ancient sites in the immediate hinterland. 1976). A positive correlation of site size with surface artifact diversity reinforces the conclusion that the Jenne-jeno vicinity functioned as part of a hierarchical urban region (R. and S. McIntosh 1983a, S. and R. McIntosh 1984). At the beginning of the following period (AD 800 to 1400), the vast site of Kaniana is settled. Around AD 1000, however, Hambarketolo and Kaniana are abandoned. Jenne-jeno and most satellite sites begin a decline, ending in abandonment by 1400. This period of decline coincides with the appearance of North African influences such as rectilinear houseplans and spindle whorls. Evidence concerning the supra-regional context of precocious urbanism at Jenne-jeno exists in the form of homogenization of material culture at some distance from the city itself. A strict construction of Trigger's (1972) definition of the city predicts inundation of rural markets by the production of urban specialists. However, a recent ethnoarchaeo- logical study of the exchange networks of artisans of modern Jenne shows that extensive regional homogenization may be maintained by local producers eagerly emulating a high status city 'style' (LaViolette 1987, see Dieterlen 1965-66). Do nearly identical *0 0 N A</page><page sequence="10">150 Roderick J. Mclntosh and Susan Keech McIntosh assemblages at great distances along the Middle Niger indicate an 'urban' region of enormous dimensions? Or is this evidence of multiple urban regions in competitive- emulatory contact, of a very powerful central authority, or efficiency of an artisan/ trading cartel within otherwise politically autonomous regions? Whatever form they took, the pan-Middle Niger forces of integration and interaction were strong and early. As early as the first centuries BC, sites near Dia not only have pottery assemblages virtually identical to the earliest Jenne-jeno assemblages, but they also mimic the distinctive upper Delta 'clustering' of several contemporaneous sites (Figure 6). Distinctive carinated polychrome wares are characteristic of the AD 300-800 expansion phase at Jenne-jeno; they are also present throughout the 2nd-8th century sequence at Soumpi in the Lakes Region (M. Raimbault: pers. comm.) and at Tiebala (c. AD 500) at the far southern border of the upper Delta (Curdy 1982).

Virtually identical braided twine-impressed pottery, terracotta figurines, burial urns and cylindrical mud brick building technology have been documented at various sites throughout the upper Delta, from Jenne to Mopti (Bedaux et al. 1978, Barth 1977, S. and R. McIntosh 1980). Larger sites such as Jenne-jeno and Dia have comb-impressed and stamped wares whose distribution extends as far as the Lakes Region tumuli and the Niger Bend. In the last region, sites of urban proportions combine in rank-size regional hierarchies (S. and R. McIntosh 1986) (Figure 7). We have suggested that these patterns reflect the continuing development of the Middle Niger as a major transport axis, on which Jenne-jeno served as an exchange point for Saharan copper and salt, and savanna gold, iron and agricultural produce in both pre-Arab and Arab times (R. and S. McIntosh 1981). The Arab-controlled trans-Saharan trade was later grafted onto this trade (Brooks 1986, S. and R. McIntosh 1980 and 1983). While the evidence for exotics (copper by AD 400, gold by 800) is evocative of distant connections and the growing diversity of the population, it is sobering to recall that excavations reveal only a minute fraction of the riverine trade, the staples of which would have been invisible commestibles such as grains, salt, smoked meat, fish oil, condiments and, equally invisible, slaves. Even in the lowest Jenne-jeno levels one finds scores of stone grinders (made to standardized shapes and sizes) and smelting slag and furnace parts. Ore had to be shipped in from at least 75km. The mastery of the contemporaneous potters suggests at least part-time specialization. From her Jenne ethnoarchaeological work, LaViolette (1987) argues that uniformity of wares and vast areal homogenization, such as we see in pottery from the commencement of the Jenne-jeno sequence, is a hallmark of organized craft production. Further evidence of specialization rests in the clustered settlements around Jenne-jeno, where satellite sites demonstrate statistical exclusivity of six classes of 'occupational' artifacts (Salituro n.d.). Some specialists chose to live at Jenne-jeno, but a significant number of others lived in physically segregated communities within 500m of each other (R. and S. McIntosh 1983a and 1986). Specialized iron production along the Niger Bend, Lakes Region, and at sites B-E in the Mema likewise appears to be concentrated at separate sites (Haaland 1980, S. and R. McIntosh 1986, Raimbault and Sidibe n.d., Szumowski 1957). The close ties between dynasts and blacksmiths is a pervasive theme in Mande oral traditions, so answers to questions concerning the apparent association of iron smelting remains with Middle Niger tumuli might help push back reconstruction of political evolution (S. McIntosh, submitted, Raimbault and Sidibe n.d.). Unfortunately, the Middle Niger monuments and associated settlement sites have had a checkered history of research. The largest megalithic group, Tondidaro, fell victim to adventurism during the colonial period (Maes 1924). Earlier this century, excavations at two massive tumuli, El Oualadji and Killi, revealed wooden burial chambers with rich grave goods and human sacrifices, clearly reminiscent of the Middle Senegal phenomenon and of al-Bakri's description of the burial of a king of the Ghana Empire (Desplagnes 1903 and 1951). The association of tumuli and megaliths is more certain here than in the Middle Senegal, but here too their distribution over the landscape and association with the few excavated</page><page sequence="12">152 Roderick J.

Earthen tumuli and megaliths are most numerous and impressive along the left bank of the Lakes Region. The former have been found as far as the southern Upper Delta (S. and R. McIntosh 1980), and reputedly in the Macina and Mema (Mauny 1961) and megaliths are found below Lake Debo. In the following section we provide evidence of an ideological nature which reinforces our belief that developments in the Lakes Region, including the growth of large sites with Jenne-jeno expansion phase pottery, appearance of burial tumuli by the seventh century and their extraordinary elaboration by the eleventh century, were related to processes shaping urbanism in the upper Delta. We have suggested (S. and R. McIntosh 1986b) that tumuli reflect the increasing wealth and power of groups controlling the flow of trade goods along the Middle Niger. The future promises rapid advances now that the Middle Niger has been freed of the derivative status bequeathed it by the 'Arab stimulation' model. While we would argue the pressing need for basic culture histories for localities beyond Jenne-jeno, in order to appreciate indigenous creativity fully, we also recognize the danger that lurks in embracing minutely-focused, particularistic studies only. One attractive approach to animating research on broader issues such as urbanism or state formation is the Peer Polity interaction paradigm (Renfrew and Cherry 1986). This paradigm not only provides mechanisms by which to explain contemporaneous homogeneity in a supra- region such as the Middle Niger, but it also purports to explain intensification of production and elaboration of the social hierarchy and belief system, while avoiding the need for coercive structures to transmit change or maintain unity. The Peer Polity Interaction model has come under some criticism for asking prehistorians to provide a quality of information usually available only for historical, literate regions (Knapp 1986). So much the better. It is precisely questions about the presence of contemporaneous socio-political entities, their spatial extent, the degree of autonomy and material - ideological equivalence, and level of contact between polities that need to be addressed if Middle Niger research is to progress. The Middle Niger may also provide the key to understanding pan-Mande traditions of alliances between smiths and emerging political leadership (McNaughton 1987). The blacksmith king is a recurring theme of Mande oral tradition, for example, and S. McIntosh (submitted) has discussed how the secret knowledge required for smelting provides a key in Mande society to the occult power that makes political action possible. This is part of a pan-West African inquiry into the relation of emerging specialist groups, the curious mosaic spread of metallurgy, and elaboration of ideological systems. Belief systems Current West African research reflects in the discipline a lamentable lack of concern with issues of prehistoric beliefs. In part as a strategy to transcend Western categories such as 'art', 'ideology' or 'ritual', we elect to frame this section in terms of belonging.

African art history is changing from the tradition of inventing a morphological typology for a small class of artifact (Art) removed from chronological or cultural context (Vansina 1984), to a search in oral histories or ethnographic myths and rituals for practices with material expressions similar to those found in archaeological context. This represents an enormous leap forward in the recognition of the primacy of context. However, if we are dependent upon ethnographic practices for interpretation of the past, how can we recognize or interpret practices for which there are no contemporary vestiges? Being charitable, this perhaps explains the poverty of thought about prehistoric West African belief systems. The Senegambian megaliths and tumuli should be perfect subjects for speculation about the ideology behind complex society. Apart from early Solar Cult ramblings (Jouenne 1920), there has only been a low-keyed debate about whether the megaliths are tomb markers or were themselves 'sacralized' by the (sati?) burials inside (Descamps 1981, Hill 1981). The ecological conditions causing the decline after 4500 BP of LSA sites along the Tichitt cliffs underlie speculations on the origin of the widespread Sahelian snake and rainmaker cult (the former as symbolic mediator of stress at times of unpredictable rain or as metaphor for whirlwinds preceding torrential Sahelian rains) and upon the appropriation of this cult by the rulers of the Ghana Empire (Bathily 1975, Holl 1985, Maley 1981). We have seen that Shaw (1977) derived alternative interpretations of the Igbo Ukwu burial and attendant ritual from Igbo ethnography, thereby liberating us from evoking states in every elite funerary situation. Speculation about ideological transformations during early Yoruba state evolution is encouraged by a comparison of the diversity of art styles and contexts at early Ife with the royal monopoly of state artisans and the realization of copper and bronze as sumptuary items at Benin after AD 1400 (Herbert 1984, Shaw 1981). The Middle Niger offers particular potential for studies of the evolving ideological base of complex societies. Here, the Lakes Region tumuli and megaliths constitute the most obvious evidence of hierarchically-organized society. According to the 'Arab stimulus' paradigm, these elite monuments were only a syncretistic variation on Meghrebian (esp. Ibadite) tombs of secular princes and saints. Archaeologists were content to repeat el-Bakri's 11th century description of the tumulus interment of a king of Ghana, i.e., these entomb royals or 'warrior chiefs' and their household retinue or slaves (Desplages 1951: 1172, Fontes et al. 1985, Mauny 1961, Saliege et al. 1980). Middle Niger megaliths are scarcely interpreted at all. Clerisse (1931) invoked solar cults and Maes (1924) argued that the engraved stones of Tondidaro mark sex differentiated necropoli. With dates as early as the 7th century for these monuments, questions about the indigenous beliefs they reinforced are completely open. Was conflict (coercion, appropriation of power and wealth by those controlling riverine commerce) or cooperation the order of day among various ranks of emerging hierarchical society? Did the non-elite derive some perceived symbolic benefit from the erection of the monument? Were the human sacrifices here analogous to the sati seen at the rise of the state in Egypt, Early Dynastic Sumeria, Bronze Age China etc.? Perhaps these will also</page><page sequence="15">From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger 155 offer novel perspectives on the homogenization of material culture in the Middle Niger, since copper-alloy jewelry, terracotta figurines, and several classes of fine pottery from the Jenne-Mopti region were recovered from tumuli excavations (Lebeuf and Paques 1970, Nesmith 1984, de Grunne 1983). Desplagnes (1951: 1171) noticed a cardinal point orientation to classes of 'sacrificed' objects on the surface of El Oualadgi (N = iron, spindle whorls, E = bone, terracotta figurines, S = copper, weapons, horse remains, SE = smelting, W = clay applique, stone). Have we been granted a first glimpse of a Middle Niger imago mundi that may in turn aid symbolic interpretation elsewhere in the Middle Niger? The perennial questions of Middle Niger ethnicity have commanded the greatest attention to beliefs, myth, rituals, and expressions of belonging (Gallais 1967, Sundstrom 1972, reviewed in S. and R. McIntosh 1980). When did each of the present groups arrive or coalesce in their identity? How is the present ethnic mosaic maintained? Bedaux's team (1978) designed research expressly for the purpose of finding physical anthropologi- cal data specific to certain ethnic groups. Others have used linguistic clues (Brooks 1986, Winters 1986) or oral traditions (Gallais 1967, Sundstrom 1972) to discuss competing claims that the earliest groups (Bozo, Nono-Marka, and possibly Dogon, Bobo and Songhay) arrived in successive waves, were once a single group that later differentiated, or represent many groups who later fused as professional groups. We have explored another way to investigate 'corporate belonging', namely to begin from broad expectations about how behaviour changes as society becomes more complex and about how art functions at such times (R. and S. McIntosh 1979, 1983a and 1986, S. and R. McIntosh 1985). Implications testable in excavation are derived from these expectations. Art serves as an instrument of communication by making references, however abstractly, to archaeologically-explicable realities of the social life and history of its makers' community. The artist taps a larger symbolic repertory shared at least partially with his or her contemporaries. Under circumstances for which one must control carefully, the archaeologist may be alerted to growing complexity and the emergence of hierarchies in a society by a change in diversity of symbolic expression. In some contexts, co-operation among newly emergent corporate groups (subsistence specialists, artisans, soldiers, officials) is enforced by a coercive elite. There is a substantial literature about why, in these cases, one would expect a simplification and canonization of symbolic expression. In the absence of evidence of coercion, such as at burgeoning Jenne-jeno, problems arise as more persons, each with greater potential for conflicting claims upon identity come together ('Do I interact with this person as a smith, as a Bozo, as a resident of Djoboro quarter, or as an adept in the worship of the great god "X"?'). With greater potential for ambiguity of belonging came greater need for elaborate symbols constraining the concept of belonging. The proliferation of ethnically- distinct cloth and hairstyles along the Middle Niger is well-documented for the recent ethnographic past. Not all group insignia will preserve archaeologically (most notably, dialects). Some items may not function as insignia (e.g., 'homogenized' ceramics). Only with great difficulty (if at all) will we assign specific insignia to a specific and corporate entity. Still, some classes of archaeological materials provide a window on population -- wide manipulation of large constellations of symbols. Terracotta art appears to reflect change in what we have called 'corporate discourse'</page><page sequence="16">156 Roderick J. McIntosh and Susan Keech Mcintosh (S. and R. McIntosh 1985) among the subcommunities at Jenne-jeno. Before excavations at the site in 1977, hundreds of terracottas had been illegally plundered from the upper Delta. Thus we knew of the fantastic stylistic and thematic variability of this art but, lacking chronology and context, we had not a clue as to its communicative role. Through careful excavation we can situate art in specific contexts of use or abandonment, such as 'protective' figures purposefully buried in walls near house entrances, others associated with funerary urns or with 'rainmaking altars', or abandoned after ritual decapitation. The frequency of art correlates with episodes of settlement change independently derived from stratigraphy (Table 1). We tentatively interpret this figure as evidence for a gradual growth of ambiguity of belonging, building strength once the settlement achieved urban status, until c. AD 1000, when population and corporate 'discourse' burgeoned dangerously and the entire traditional belief system in the form of Islam. The triumph of Islam is expressed in the decrease in anthropomorphic representation, replacement by unifying symbols such as Arab dress and the monumental mosque, and the abandonment of pagan Jenne-jeno. Of course, this is only a hypothesis needing testing with independent data. It seems to be supported by the history of settlement clustering (corporate identity resolved by occupation of separate, but proximate mounds together functioning as an urban whole--- R. and S. McIntosh 1983b). This line of interpretation suggests other research priorities: can similar patterns be attested in the great variety of burial postures? Why does art correlate positively with smithing evidence at the satellite sites? Ranging further afield, does the explosion of style diversity in the art of the Nok region of Nigeria (Shaw 1978), Kareygourou-Birniwol in Niger (Gado 1980), and the southern L. Chad plain (A. LeBeuf 1976), to name only a few West African examples, also alert us to the emergence of complex societies lacking coercive authority? The future promises intense debate between advocates of competing 'conflict' (Carneiro 1970, Haas 1982) versus 'cooperation' theses of complex society. Some 'cooperation' theses emphasize the manipulation of ideology by elite as means by which structural inequalities of society are obscured from the non-privileged (Miller and Tilley 1984). Another perspective that might prove more immediately useful in the Middle Niger sees the establishment of complex society as a fluid process whereby many subgroups within the community have access to a larger, sometimes unconsciously held inventory of symbols, myth, rituals and ideologies (R. and S. McIntosh, submitted). Elements of belief curated in this reservoir, if reflected upon, would be agreed to have some relevance to most or all members of society. Only a fraction might be used in any generation and one would see fluid penetration of new elements, as well as loss of some old, through the permeable membrane of each reservoir. Each subgroup will legitimate claims to new status by appropriating and manipulating subsets of the symbolic inventory. In some cases, subgroups may compete for the privilege of minor redefinitions of a highly conservative canon of beliefs; in others, entirely new traditions will be invented to suit changing circumstances (Hobsbawn and Ranger 1983). The example of Kongusa, one of the many ancient mounts surrounding Jenne-jeno, may be instructive (LaVillette 1987). Tradition holds that the mound remains a centre of pre-Islamic occult power. It is considered too dangerous for the good citizens of Jenne to walk on Kongusa. Here we see a reputation of prehistoric origin, quite different from</page><page sequence="17">Table 1 Episodes of clay figurine and appliqu6 art from Jenne-jeno Total represen- Terracotta statuettes Terracotta applique tational art Other Statuettes Clay 'toys' in original Fragments Human Snake Other Total of domestic Episodes context in situ Total motif motif animal Total terracotta animals c.

McIntosh and Susan Keech Mcintosh any of the other 65 nearby mounds, curated to the present. By claiming that Kongusa was their ancestral home, two powerful Jenne smith families have reinforced their own claim to occult power (for example, increasing belief in the curative powers of drinking their quenching water) and in one case reducing the low status attending possession of a Bobo name. Clearly, Kongusa warrants some archaeological attention (if one can summon the courage). The advantage of this approach is that no directionality is implied, neither centripetal nor fissiparous tendencies are predicted. Just as it does not predict which subgroups will play the symbolic manipulation game successfully or which will be eclipsed, the whole experiment with hierarchical society can fade away with the demise of a charismatic person, a dynasty, or a symbolic canon. The Middle Niger is a dazzling mosaic of ethnic groups, corporations defined by occupation or by status, of descendants of slaves who lost knowledge of prior affinities, and of descendants of empire-wielders (who never allow you to forget this fact). This more fluid, non-directional approach to complex society appears to us to be the best way to design research both into the emergence of the very concept of corporate specialization and the maintenance and indeed elaboration of the Middle Niger corporate mosaic even after the imposition of unifying ideologies (Islam, modern Malian nationalism) or coercive hegemony of ruling powers (Mali and Songhay empires, Hamdullahi, France) in the present millennium. Final word Prehistoric archaeology is now embroiled in a debate about the legitimacy of cross- cultural studies of social and technical transformations such as agriculture, urbanism, or the state (Hodder 1982 and 1986). Some believe that the development of each culture is the product of an historically unique context. If this were so, there would be no point to wondering whether, for example the sati in the Lakes Region tumuli alert us to circumstances of state formation comparable to those at unification in Egypt, Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, or early Shang China. Some might claim that the similarities in settlement clustering dynamics in the upper Delta, Sumeria or Hwang-ho floodplain (Adams 1981, Chang 1976, R. and S. McIntosh 1983) or any parallels between the lack of palacial edifice at Jenne-jeno and the great Harrappan cities (Miller 1985) are just so many chimera because our present knowledge of the dynamics of these phenomena reflect all the biases and blindnesses of the archaeologists who excavated and reported them. We remain optimistic. In the absence of a priori certainty that prehistory is absolutely historically particular, we view the Middle Niger as one of the world's original theaters of indigenous transformations in social and symbolic organization. Whether that originality implies uniqueness or the ability to provide insights explicating comparable human responses to comparable circumstances remains to be seen. Middle Niger archaeology possesses an advantage in that it is in its infancy and thus can consciously avoid some of the biases that have plagued research elsewhere. In particular, topical discreteness or the so-called Hawkesian ladder of inference (Hawkes 1954) is so pervasive in the western way of thinking that even those who argue against the primacy of environment or</page><page sequence="19">From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger 159 technology often end up substituting a primacy of the ideological (Hodder 1982, Miller and Tilley 1984). The topical divisions of this article (e.g., Belief Systems) are artifacts of a broadly-conceived synthesis, rather than necessarily reflecting the best framework for research. We believe it will be impossible, for example, to understand the emergence of smiths without giving as much research weight to their occult knowledge as to their social standing or sources of ore and fuel. The list of indissoluble categories is endless: are tumuli to be studied as monuments to social status or to ideology? Can subsistence and surplus be studied independently of climatic oscillations or trade and specialization? Can the emergence of ethnicity be understood by separating specialization from social place from beliefs about belonging? Can specialist production and trade in copper be separated from its emergence in some societies as a sumptuary item reserved for highly canonical art? They cannot be separated. As archaeologists we deal with the incompletely preserved remains of past action upon multiple aspects of the world as socially constructed by prehistoric peoples. It is perhaps an historical aberration of our own culture that analytical reductionism is celebrated as a superior way to interpret the world. But even physicists working on unifying theories or computer scientists researching artificial intelligence find reductionism a not always satisfactory approach to their enterprise. As we emerge from the siecles obscurs fatalism about what is knowable, we have an opportunity to approach Midele Niger prehistory from a unifying perspective -- one that does not privilege one research sphere over the others. The ultimate goal of Middle Niger research is to view the prehistoric construction of the world through the subsequent revisionist veils of Islamic world view, colonialism and the World System, which will obscure earlier centuries from traditional, text-dependant historians.

McIntosh and Susan Keech McIntosh From Siecles Obscurs to revolutionary centuries on the Middle Niger In a period of little over a decade, excavations have transformed our characterization of Middle Niger prehistory from hidden and humble to one of the world's most original theatres of change. After situating the Middle Niger evidence for geomorphology, domestication, organization of society and production, and belief systems against a backdrop of current concerns in West African prehistory, we suggest future research directions of particular potential. The Middle Niger lends a new perspective on current thinking about the prehistorian's enterprise, most notably about the symbolic component of the world as socially constructed, cross-cultural studies, and the integrity of our traditional analytical categories.</page></plain_text>
