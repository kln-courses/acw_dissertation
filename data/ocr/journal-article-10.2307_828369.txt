Nonhuman animals are property under present law' and hence receive a degree of legal protection.2 Animal welfare legislation furnishes them addi- tional defense against mistreatment.3 All this legal protection, however, is anthropocentric. Animals are objects of legal concern as a function of their importance to present and future generations of humans." No legal standards or procedures exist to protect interests animals possess independently of their Rebecca Dresser is assistant professor, Center for Ethics, Medicine and Public Issues, Baylor College of Medicine.

Animal welfare laws reflect not simply concern for the animals' well-being, but concern for the human brutalization entailed in animal abuse. Regan, supra note 1, at 160; Rollin, supra, at 78-79.

The legal status of animals is only one aspect of their exclusion from the category of beings humans deem worthy of moral concern.5 Tom Regan believes we are morally obligated to recognize and replace our "impoverished" view of animals (at 344). According to Regan, animals have moral status and basic rights to be treated respectfully. Applying Regan's theory of animal rights would yield revolutionary change in our treatment of animals. Humans may respond now with incredulity, even laughter, to such notions, yet Regan's work is careful and considered scholarship, the culmination of several years of thought. As Robert Nozick remarked in an earlier review of The Case for Animal Rights, Regan "does not ... fit the mold of crank."6 Regan is, moreover, one member of an expanding group of contemporary moral philosophers who have examined human thoughts and actions con- cerning animals and concluded that we are a "speciesist" culture, perpetua- ting morally indefensible prejudices against individuals solely because their biological classifications differ from our own.7 The group challenging our current practices toward animals is composed of members of other disci- plines as well. Research scientists, veterinarians, ethologists, and lawyers join Regan in questioning the propriety of present human attitudes and actions toward nonhuman animals.8 Regan believes that rights theory supplies the most solid moral basis for our duties to animals. In The Case for Animal Rights, he explains why, but the book undertakes a broader task than merely applying the rights view to animals. Regan constructs an argument in favor of recognizing individual rights for certain animal and human beings. The Case for Animal Rights is thus both a general and an applied critique of several competing moral theo- ries. The work is valuable not only for its perceptive analysis of our treatment of animals but also for its more comprehensive clarification and defense of the rights view. The precision and complexity of Regan's work calls for more than a brief summary. This review tries to do justice to his sophisticated philosophical analysis by describing it in some detail. I then reflect on one of Regan's targets: the use of animals in scientific research. The first three chapters of The Case for AnimalRights explore animal con- sciousness. Regan begins by describing Descartes's view of animals as ma- chines operating without conscious awareness (at 3-25). To Descartes and his followers, the cries animals emit when they are struck are analogous to the noise produced by a squeaky spring when it is touched. In this view, animals 5.

Although the modern response is to reject this conception outright, it retains its power among, for example, scientists who discount animal pain and suffering in the belief that such ex- periences are qualitatively different from human pain and suffering. Bernard E. Rollin describes the paradox of this view.9 The very scientists making such claims typically use animals as research subjects in the belief that the experi- mental results can be generalized to human beings. By doing so, they must accept the idea that at least some animal and human experiences are qualita- tively similar. Regan points out two major flaws in the Cartesian concept of animals. What is there about humans that suggests they are constructed any different- ly from the animal-machines? For Descartes, it was the human ability to use language and, more importantly, the existence of a human soul through which an omnipotent and omniscient God produces interaction between hu- man mental and physical events. Recent work with primates has seriously weakened the view that Homo sapiens is the sole species capable of language use. Furthermore, Regan argues that Descartes's theory cannot account for the human capacity to acquire language. But the essential weakness of Des- cartes's claim, Regan believes, is its reliance on mystery, for the Cartesian concept of an "immaterial soul" rests on particular religious convictions that can only remain inexplicable to humankind. Regan counters the unsatisfying Cartesian explanation with his "Cumula- tive Argument for animal consciousness." Once we assume that humans have a mental life (as every moral theorist must assume), Regan argues that the following five points are convincing reasons to attribute qualitatively similar consciousness to certain animals. 1. The attribution of consciousness to certain animals is part of the common- sense view of the world; attempts to discredit this belief, if Descartes's attempt is taken as illustrative, have proven to lack adequate justification. 2. The attribution of consciousness to certain animals is in harmony with the ordinary use of language; attempts to reform or replace this way of speaking S. . also have proven to lack adequate justification. 3. The attribution of consciousness to animals does not imply or assume that ani- mals have immortal (immaterial) souls and thus can be made and defended in- dependently of religious convictions about life after death. 4. How animals behave is consistent with viewing them as conscious. 5. An evolutionary understanding of consciousness provides a theoretical basis for attributing awareness to animals other than human beings. (At 28) The attribution of consciousness to animals is not anthropomorphic, Regan argues; on the contrary, it is supported by scientific evidence.10 Here Regan refers to the work of Donald Griffin, a well-known ethologist and ani- 9. See Rollin, supra note 4, at 30-33. 10. It is scientists themselves who have provided us with the information on animal consciousness and experience that reveals the morally disturbing elements of our current practices. See, e.g., David Mac- Donald &amp; Marian Dawkins, Ethology-The Science and the Tool, in Animals in Research, supra note 8, at 203-23.</page><page sequence="4">834 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 mal psychologist." Griffin relies on similarities in human and animal neuro- physiology, as well as on the adaptive value of conscious awareness, to sup- port his argument that animals have mental experiences. He believes that his own work and that of other students of animal communication behavior demonstrate that differences between human language and animal com- munication are quantitative, not qualitative. Scientists who have observed and analyzed the dances of honey bees, for instance, claim these insects engage in communication that is intentional, versatile, complex, and sym- bolic. As Griffin admits, his position is contested. He acknowledges that ex- isting evidence on animal consciousness fails to "prove" that animals are aware; but he is convinced that the evidence supports at least an "openmind- ed agnosticism."'12 Griffin labels the belief that humans are the only beings capable of mental experience both "unparsimonious" and "conceited.''"3 In Regan's eyes, this pronouncement rightly "prick[s] the balloon of our puffed-up species pride" underlying the denial that animals possess a mental life (at 31). After defending the existence of animal consciousness, Regan describes it. First, he refutes the claims of British philosopher R. G. Frey, who argues that their lack of a language prevents animals from possessing beliefs (at 38-49). In Frey's view, the object of a belief must be that a particular sentence is true. Because animals are without the capacity to use language, and hence to form sentences, they cannot formulate beliefs. Regan criticizes this theory on sev- eral grounds, among them its failure to account for either the communica- tion of beliefs between humans who speak different languages or the ability of human children to acquire language. Next, Regan contests the position that we cannot ascribe beliefs and de- sires to animals because despite their possessing them we are unable to dis- cern the content of such beliefs and desires (at 49-76). As a result, claims phi- losopher Stephen Stich, we are foreclosed from understanding and interpret- ing animals' behavior by referring to their mental states. Regan maintains that we can discover something about the content of animal beliefs and de- sires. Although the "Fido Bone Profile"'14 may not include all the properties comprising the human concept of bone, a wholistic view of canine behavior, joined with the Cumulative Argument for animal consciousness, supplies a reasonable basis for asserting that dogs share at least one component of our belief about bones: a bone will fulfill one's desire for a particular taste. We can reasonably assume, therefore, that Fido at least shares with us what Regan calls a "preference-belief." To form this preference-belief, Fido must be capable of remembering the flavor of bones, of forming a general concept 11. Donald R. Griffin, The Question of Animal Awareness: Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Ex- perience 170 (rev. ed. New York: Rockefeller University Press, 1981). 12. Id. at 171. 13. Id. at 170. 14.

" Regan at 57.</page><page sequence="5">No. 4 RESPECTING AND PROTECTING NONHUMAN ANIMALS 835 of "bone," and of applying that general concept to specific objects. Further, Regan argues, Fido's bone-related behavior suggests that he also is capable of intentional action, emotion, sentience, and a sense of his own future. Regan may overstate the certainty with which we can attribute all these characteristics to animals, for ethologists and other animal scientists profess hesitancy in conferring some of these labels on animal functioning.15 Yet the important question is whether Regan's possible overenthusiasm on this mat- ter seriously undermines his next major assertion: animal and human aware- ness are sufficiently similar to suggest that the species have qualitatively simi- lar interests. Animals, like humans, possess a form of autonomy (at 84-86). Regan readily concedes that animals lack Kantian autonomy, which requires the capacity to reflect on one's possible actions and to determine the morally appropriate choice. Regan is convinced, however, that his account of animal consciousness demonstrates that animals have a simpler "preference auton- omy," stemming from their possession of preferences and capacities to act to fulfill those preferences. Because preference autonomy develops with age, Regan stipulates that the term animal refers to "mentally normal mammals of a year or more," and the term human includes "all those Homo sapiens aged one year or more, who are not very profoundly mentally retarded or otherwise quite markedly mentally impoverished" (at 78). He adopts these working definitions to sim- plify the discussion yet recognizes that the line-drawing task is difficult and controversial. He returns later to this problem and considers how moral con- straints might apply to individuals excluded from his definitions. Besides their interests in exercising autonomy (to satisfy their preference- interests), animals, Regan writes, share welfare-interests with humans. These interests encompass aspects of treatment that benefit individuals indepen- dently of their preferences for or against such treatment.1' The two types of interests comprise what must be satisfied if an individual, animal or human, is to "live well." Although humans typically satisfy their preferences in more numerous and varied ways than animals do, Regan believes their welfare is similar and can be described in terms of benefit and harm. Regan defines harm as either suffering or deprivation (at 94-99). Thus, in- dividuals placed in environments depriving them of their autonomy and wel- fare-interests are harmed even if they do not experience suffering as a result 15. See, e.g., Carolyn A. Ristau, Language, Cognition, and Awareness in Animals? in Jeri Sechzer, ed., The Role of Animals in Biomedical Research 170 (New York: New York Academy of Sciences, 1983). 16. Regan at 87-88. Courts and commentators have struggled to formulate substantive standards and procedures for ascertaining when humans should be disqualified from exercising autonomous decision making and what guidelines proxy decision makers should follow to show respect for the incompetent per- son and to further his or her welfare. See, e.g., Sup't of Belchertown v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 370 N.E.2d 417 (1977). See also Loren H. Roth, Alan Meisel, &amp; Charles W. Lidz, Tests of Competency to Consent to Treatment, 134 Am. J. Psychiatry 279 (1977); John A. Robertson, Organ Donations by In- competents and the Substituted Judgment Doctrine, 76 Colum. L. Rev. 48 (1976). Their relatively less complex preferences and needs might reduce the difficulties inherent in proxy decision making on behalf of animals. On the other hand, because we are less knowledgeable about the preferences and needs of species other than our own, such proxy decision making may present formidable challenges.</page><page sequence="6">836 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 of their loss. In this analysis, whether it is painless or painful, death is the "ultimate" and "irreversible" harm because it destroys all opportunities to satisfy one's preferences. (Regan acknowledges, at 100, that death may not be the "worst harm," for a life promising only intense and unremitting suf- fering could be worse than death.) Regan illustrates the concepts of animal preferences and animal welfare by analyzing euthanasia (at 109-16). He sets three minimal conditions for classi- fying active killing as euthanasia: (1) the killing must be performed using the least painful method available; (2) death must truly be in the individual's best interests and the killer must believe this; and (3) the killer must be motivated by concern for the welfare or interests of the one who is killed. According to these criteria, we euthanize untreatably ill or injured animals who suffer and will continue to suffer for the rest of their lives. We kill such animals on the belief that their preference would be to have their pain terminated. Such preference-respecting euthanasia contrasts with paternalistic euthanasia. We act paternalistically toward animals when, in attempting to protect their wel- fare, we act in conflict with their present preferences. Hence, paternalistic euthanasia is killing animals "for their own good" when they have no rea- son, such as pain, to prefer death. Regan concludes from this analysis that the typical animal shelter policy of killing healthy but unwanted cats and dogs fails to qualify as either prefer- ence-respecting or paternalistic euthanasia, since it is false that these animals would be better off dead than alive. They would instead be better off if the shelters continued to care for them. Given the shelters' economic constraints and consequent inability to care for all unadopted animals, the present policy may constitute the most merciful alternative, but it is not euthanasia: "It is no more true to say that healthy dogs and cats are euthanized when they are 'put to sleep' to make room for other dogs and cats at animal shelters than it would be to say that healthy derelicts would be euthanized if they were 'put to sleep' to make room for other derelicts at human shelters" (at 116). This is the first of many instances in which Regan exposes a conceptual weakness or inaccuracy underlying our attitudes and practices toward non- human animals. As the book continues, he turns his critical eye to other cus- toms we currently take for granted. Although in doing so Regan challenges several commonly held intuitive beliefs about animals and humans, he does not reject the legitimacy of intuitions or their relevance to moral philosophy." Regan explains his position on intuitions in a chapter setting forth criteria for ideal moral judgments and describing the basic categories of moral theory, consequentialist and nonconsequentialist (at 121-49). He dis- cusses characteristics that ideal moral judgments ought to incorporate (con- ceptual clarity, factual information, rationality and logic, impartiality, dis- passionate reflection, and valid moral principles), together with standards 17. For a concise summary of the debate over the role of intuitions in moral philosophy, see Baruch A. Brody, Ethics and Its Applications 24-33 (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1983).</page><page sequence="7">No. 4 RESPECTING AND PROTECTING NONHUMAN ANIMALS 837 for evaluating moral principles (consistency, adequacy of scope, precision, conformity with our moral intuitions, and parsimony). According to Regan, a moral intuition is legitimate only if it holds up against the characteristics of an ideal moral judgment. The intuition must be what he calls a "considered belief," rather than an unexamined one. Regan defends his belief in the legitimacy of moral intuitions against the consequentialist charge that this approach permits prejudice and is inherent- ly morally conservative (at 136-40). On the contrary, Regan claims that prej- udicial ideas subjected to his six criteria could not survive as considered be- liefs. Indeed, one way he rebuffs this critique of appeals to intuition is to ar- gue that utilitarianism itself can sanction prejudice, due to the moral weight that theory gives to whatever preferences and sources of pleasure prevail in a particular culture. In subsequent chapters, Regan assesses a variety of philo- sophical approaches to animals against his criteria for ideal moral judgments and valid moral principles. Regan initiates this examination with a look at the indirect duty views arti- culated by Kant, Narveson, and Rawls (at 150-94). These theories have in common the principle that any obligations and duties we owe to animals are functions of direct responsibilities we have to humans or to God. Kant's statement on animals is representative: If a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of service, he does not fail in his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot judge, but his act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity which it is his duty to show towards man- kind. If he is not to stifle his human feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. 8 According to the indirect duty views, we owe direct moral duties solely to other moral agents, that is, to those individuals with the capacity for exercis- ing reciprocal responsibilities toward us. The indirect duty views are not nec- essarily speciesist, for they may group animals with those humans who also lack the capacity to conform their behavior to moral principles. Animal and human members of this group are "moral patients" who "cannot do what is right, nor can they do what is wrong" (at 152). Moral patients are unable to assert their rights, but Regan believes such incapacity is not a legitimate rea- son to disqualify them as rights holders. Instead, he asserts, the vulnerability of moral patients may increase society's obligation to protect the rights of such individuals (at 283-84). 18. Regan at 177-78, quoting Immanuel Kant, Duties to Animals and Spirits, in Lectures on Ethics 239-41, trans. Louis Infield (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963). The indirect duty position has been manipulated to support the use of experimental animals in medical education. A developer of computer programs simulating human and animal systems reports the following: "Many physicians have expressed to me concern that medical students trained with computers will come to regard their patients in a less humanitarian way than those trained with experimental animals." James R. Walker, Computer Simula- tion of Animal Systems in the Medical School Laboratory, 11 Alternatives to Laboratory Animals 47 (1983).</page><page sequence="8">838 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 Regan finds the indirect duty approach morally deficient. Because moral patients share with moral agents preference- and welfare-interests, they can be harmed in similar ways. For example, Regan writes, if a child, a retarded adult, or an animal is tortured, the moral wrong committed lies not only in the danger that the torturer may extend this practice to moral agents; it lies as well in the direct wrong committed against the suffering moral patient (at 182-83). To relegate moral patients to a lesser moral status and to regard their treatment as "merely a sort of moral warm-up" (at 186) are intuitive be- liefs that fail to meet the previously articulated standards for evaluating moral judgments. Such evaluation instead supports Regan's principle that we owe to all individuals possessing an experiential welfare a prima facie duty not to harm them (the harm principle)."'9 Regan labels the exclusion of moral patients from this duty arbitrary, given their abilities to suffer harm and to exercise preference autonomy. Regan next turns his attention to a group of theories conferring on humans direct duties to animals, but on grounds other than animal rights. First, he scrutinizes the typical humane society tenets proscribing cruelty and prescrib- ing kindness to animals (at 195-200). Because this approach defines morality according to the actor's state of mind, it is insufficient to proscribe a great deal of the harm inflicted on animals. In slaughterhouses and laboratories, for example, the pain and death animals suffer is imposed by humans who lack the requisite cruel intent. Regan thus deems this view an inadequate basis for improving the lot of animals. His subsequent target is utilitarianism (at 200-28, 233-58). Regan invests great effort in exposing the defects he perceives in this theory, both because of its status as a primary competitor of rights theory and because Peter Sing- er, a pioneer philosopher-defender of animal interests, is a preference utili- tarian. Regan concedes that the classical utilitarians advanced the status of animals beyond indirect duty views by attributing value to the pleasures and pains of all sentient beings. Yet he believes this egalitarianism is deceptive, for utilitarianism may still countenance racism, sexism, and speciesism. These consequences can materialize due to utilitarian concepts of individuals as receptacles of pleasure and pain, in the classical view, or of desires and preferences, in preference utilitarian theory. Although at the outset of the utilitarian calculation, "Each [is] to count for one, no one for more than one" (at 202, quoting Jeremy Bentham), the positive and negative values of particular actions to individuals are then added to determine the optimal consequences on an aggregate level. According to utilitarianism, the moral action is the one yielding the best overall results. The utilitarian principle of equality thus fails to produce equal treatment of individuals when dissimilar treatment would maximize utility. Regan dis- cusses one intuitively troubling outcome of the utilitarian calculation, its moral approval of killing that produces an aggregate balance of pleasure or 19. Regan at 187-93. See infra text accompanying notes 30-34.</page><page sequence="9">No. 4 RESPECTING AND PROTECTING NONHUMAN ANIMALS 839 satisfied preferences. He fears utilitarian analysis can too easily authorize killing human and animal moral patients, given the burdens these individuals often impose on others. A second problem lies in the utilitarian dependence on empirical evidence to determine which actions will produce the optimal overall results. Regan is worried that a thorough analysis of, for instance, the meat industry could re- veal that the massive economic and culinary interests humans have at stake outweigh the gains to animals of bringing the animal food industry to a halt. This aspect of utilitarianism also makes the obligation to be a vegetarian con- tingent on the existence of a sufficient number of other vegetarians to make an actual difference in the extent to which animals are raised on factory farms. "For there is, on this view, no obligation to abstain from eating meat if too few people do abstain, so that those who do eat meat do nothing wrong" (at 225). In summary, Regan rejects the notion that utility ought to be the overriding moral principle guiding our conduct toward either humans or animals. In the material that follows, I will present his reasons for believ- ing that justice requires us to give greater respect and protection to individ- uals.20 The ideal moral principle is impartial. It complies with the formal principle of justice: we must treat like cases alike except when a morally relevant dif- ference supports treating them differently. Philosophers disagree on the con- tent of morally relevant justifications for dissimilar treatment. Regan dis- cusses the perfectionist theories, which hold that we owe better treatment to individuals possessing greater talent or virtue (at 233-35). This view lacks contemporary support because it can authorize extreme social discrimina- tion. Regan maintains that we must nevertheless also take care to avoid per- fectionist notions in our thinking about animals. Regan offers a nonperfectionist, nonutilitarian, egalitarian interpretation of formal justice. His interpretation is based on two postulates: (1) moral agents have equal inherent value that is unrelated to the intrinsic value of their pleasures or preference satisfactions; and (2) the attempt to deny or at- tribute less inherent value to moral patients is arbitrary (and perfectionist), given that both moral agents and patients can be subjects-of-a-life (i.e., be- ings with welfare- and preference-interests and other morally relevant capaci- ties) (at 235-48). These shared morally relevant characteristics, together with the formal justice principle, underlie a direct duty we owe to all individuals with inherent value to treat them in ways respectful of their value (the respect principle). Further, given that moral agents and patients share inherent value and an experiential welfare, Regan derives from the respect principle a prima facie direct duty not to harm such individuals. We have this duty because "we fail to treat [individuals with inherent value] in ways that respect their value if we treat them in ways that detract from their welfare" (at 262). 20. Regan recognizes that rule utilitarians might dispute this critique; he addresses the particular short- comings of this variation of utilitarianism in a separate section of the chapter. See pp. 250-58.</page><page sequence="10">840 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 Regan cautions that the subject-of-a-life characteristic is a sufficient yet perhaps not a necessary condition for an individual to possess inherent value. He avoids foreclosing the possibility that entities such as natural objects and animals and humans who fall short of the subject-of-a-life criterion may also have inherent value. An "ethic of the environment" is conceivable, he re- marks, but its supporters face formidable obstacles (at 245-46). As for hu- man fetuses and infants, Regari writes that they too may possess inherent val- ue even though they are not subjects-of-a-life. Further, he points out that they may actually possess the characteristics required to be subjects-of-a-life and that where the matter is factually unclear we should give individuals the benefit of the doubt, treating them as if they meet his criteria for moral rights. From these principles, Regan moves to his ultimate defense of the rights view (at 267-329). He describes a moral right as a claim resting on valid moral principles and imposing correlative duties on others independently of wheth- er it is recognized as a legal right. Regan maintains that the right to just treat- ment is a basic moral right. Given his normative interpretation of justice, in- dividuals with inherent value possess an equal and absolute basic right to re- spectful treatment. The respect principle and the inherent value postulate also support a prima facie right not to be harmed. In this view, we violate in- dividual rights if we regard moral agents or patients as mere receptacles of intrinsic value who can be treated with disrespect or harmed to produce opti- mal aggregate consequences. But Regan allows that even the innocent moral patient's right not to be harmed may be overridden in certain circumstances. From the respect princi- ple, Regan derives three principles for determining when it is morally permis- sible to harm innocent beings."2' According to the "miniride principle," ab- sent special considerations, if we are forced to choose between imposing comparable harm on many or few innocent beings we should override the rights of the few. The "worse-off principle" alters this result if the harm im- posed on the few would make them worse off than the many. The "liberty principle" modifies the worse-off principle by permitting us to act within cer- tain limits to avoid harm to ourselves, even if such action imposes harm on others. These principles stem not from an attempt to minimize aggregate harm, but from consideration of the magnitude of harm various acts would impose on individuals. The approach entails "assessing the losses each indi- vidual faces and assessing these losses equitably" (at 325, emphasis in original). These principles, Regan argues, constitute the most solid basis for attacking a prejudicial social system, for they prohibit imposing harm of 21. Id. at 301-12, 331-33.</page><page sequence="11">No. 4 RESPECTING AND PROTECTING NONHUMAN ANIMALS 841 greater relative magnitude upon the few to avoid harm of lesser magnitude to the many.22 At least three types of special considerations may alter the operation of these rules (at 317-24). First, valid acquired duties,23 such as those stemming from relationships with loved ones and certain institutional and contractual arrangements, may justify our acting to make an outsider "slightly" worse off to prevent harming an individual within the special relationship. Second, individuals who participate voluntarily in high-risk activities waive their rights under the worse-off principle. Race car drivers and business entrepre- neurs, for example, lack valid claims against being harmed from those risky activities if helping them would confer substantial harm on nonparticipants. Third, individuals who have engaged in or suffered from unjust violations of basic rights have respectively lesser and greater claims to protection under the miniride and worse-off principles. Regan's approach furnishes the basis-lacking in utilitarian theory-for condemning the killing of a moral agent or patient on grounds apart from the event's consequences to other individuals or its aggregate effect. Yet the rights view can resolve the lifeboat case as well. Consider a lifeboat contain- ing five survivors, with room enough for only four. The miniride and worse- off principles permit us to choose to impose harm on these individuals ac- cording to the magnitude of harm each would experience. Regan measures the harm death imposes as "a function of the opportunities for satisfaction it forecloses" (at 324). In the lifeboat containing four normal adults and one dog, the survivor thrown overboard must be the dog, for Regan assesses the dog's death as a lesser harm than the death of one of the humans. Even if a hundred or a million other dogs are in the lifeboat that will hold only four survivors, the huge number of dogs ought to be sacrificed over any of the hu- mans (at 324-25). These results are not perfectionist, he believes, because the rights view discriminates in this way solely in such exceptional situations as the lifeboat and other prevention cases. Nor are the dog sacrifices speciesist, for Regan's view would deem a normal adult dog's death a greater harm than the death of a retarded human possessing relatively fewer desires and less awareness, responsiveness, and competence to act intentionally. Any such preference for animal over human life disturbs many humans, who raise the "slippery slope" objection to proposals for discarding species 22. Regan leaves some ambiguity in analyzing the concept of comparable harm. (At 303-04, 324-25) Imagine a human with an extremely painful and completely disabling chronic heart condition. The only treatment for the condition is to transplant a valve from a cow's heart into the human. The cow will die painlessly as a result of the transplant. If we must choose to further the interests of one of these in- dividuals, which individual shall we choose? Which harm forecloses more opportunities and imposes greater deprivation? 23. Acquired duties are valid if they meet the respect principle's requirements for just treatment. A slave trader, then, cannot appeal to an employment-related duty to justify modifying the application of the miniride or worse-off principle.</page><page sequence="12">842 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 membership as the critical criterion for moral status.24 Regan argues that all human and animal moral patients who are subjects-of-a-life possess certain rights. Implementing his principles would elevate the moral status and treat- ment of animals who qualify as subjects-of-a-life, and Peter Singer generally argues for similar elevation."25 As Singer admits, however, this approach to morality calls into question the view that all human life is sacred.26 Singer ex- plicitly argues against preserving the lives of all human beings merely because they are human; instead, he believes decisions about humans and animals should reflect their capacities for morally significant activities. His assertions support the claim that conferring moral status on animals is consistent with reducing the moral status of humans who lack characteristics such as self- consciousness and the ability to communicate. What would the world be like if Regan's views took hold? First, all hu- mans who could survive without eating meat would be vegetarians. One as- pect of the right to respectful treatment is the freedom to pursue one's wel- fare, even if it makes others less well off (the liberty principle). Yet this free- dom has two qualifications. One, we cannot abrogate our duty to treat others with respect as we pursue our welfare (at 331-33). Hence, we cannot override this right of animals by claiming their suffering and deaths are justified by the resulting aggregate human pleasures and preferences of nutrition, habit, and taste, particularly in light of the many available alternatives for satis- fying these interests. The meat industry violates the respect principle by treat- ing animals as renewable resources instead of as subjects-of-a-life, as individ- uals possessing inherent value.27 It violates the harm principle as well by im- posing the prima facie greater harm of death on animals to avoid the lesser harm meat deprivation would impose on humans. The economic disruption that would result from a consumer shift to vege- tarianism fails to alter the moral equation. A second qualification of the lib- erty principle arises from one of the special considerations mentioned previ- ously. The demise of the animal food industry would impose severe econom- ic harm on farmers and other humans working in the industry. Yet Regan as- serts that because these individuals have chosen to enter the risky activity of economic competition, we owe them no duty to continue to buy their prod- ucts nor, of course, must animals give their lives to prevent this financial loss (at 338-42). Furthermore, humans in the industry cannot cite the liberty prin- ciple to support their activities, for the industry violates the respect principle by treating individuals with inherent value as if they were merely renewable resources, lacking independent moral value of their own. Regan disputes the 24. See, e.g., Peter Singer, Practical Ethics 67-68 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 25. See id. at 68. 26.

Jonathan Swift's proposal to raise human infants for food furnishes a clever and disturbing com- plement to Regan's analysis.

If those responsible for bringing an individual into existence have absolute con- trol over that individual, Regan asks, may parents also treat their children in any way they desire? Regan restates his rule: once an individual is the subject- of-a-life, he or she possesses the inherent value that requires our respectful treatment.28 Solely in the exceptional lifeboat case will the rights view permit the human survivors to kill and eat the dog to avoid their own deaths.29 Experimentation on animals is a more complicated issue, one the rights view resolves less smoothly than the matter of eating meat. Animal experi- mentation is a volatile subject that has periodically stimulated political con- troversy ever since nineteenth-century physiologists began practicing vivisec- tion.30 It also affects substantial numbers of animals: estimates of the total number of animals used annually in the United States vary from 40 million to 150 million.31 Regan addresses the major modern scientific uses of animals: education, toxicology testing, and basic and applied research. The first such practice cannot withstand Regan's rights analysis (at 364- 65). Animals are unjustly harmed and treated with disrespect when they suf- fer or lose their lives so that biology and medical students may dissect or per- form other procedures on them. The knowledge students might gain cannot justify imposing the greater magnitude of harm on animals, especially in light of the alternative means by which students may acquire such knowledge. Current educational uses of animals treat them as renewable resources, epit- omizing to Regan "our culture's throw-away attitude toward animals, as if these sensitive creatures were commodities or things" (at 368, emphasis in original). He protests as well against this use of nonmammalian animals, cit- ing both the difficulty of determining precisely which animals meet the sub- ject-of-a-life criterion, and the indirect effect this customary use of animals in education exerts on our general attitudes toward animals (at 367-68). For these reasons, Regan calls for a complete halt to this technique of science teaching. Animals are presently used to test the toxicity of nontherapeutic and thera- peutic substances. Tested products include oven cleaners, nail polishes, anti- freeze, and almost every other substance intended for human use. The notor- ious Lethal Dosage 50 test is one method of assessing toxicity. Regan quotes Singer's description of the LDs5o: 28. The present legal status of animals must be altered as well, Regan insists. The view that animals are mere property, lacking the legal status of persons, is morally unjustified and analogous to the former view of human slaves as legal property. Regan at 347-49.

Usually this means that all the animals will become very sick before half finally succumb and the other half survive. In the case of fairly harmless substances it is still considered good procedure to find the concentra- tion that will make half the animals die, consequently enormous quantities have to be force-fed to the animals, and death may be caused merely by the large volume or high concentration given to the animals .... It is also normal to let the process of poisoning take its full course, until death occurs. To put dying animals out of their misery might give a slightly inaccurate result.32 The legal status of the LD50 test has been the subject of much confusion. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and subsequent amendments require manufacturers of new drugs to furnish evidence of their product's safety be- fore it can be marketed."33 Neither the statute nor FDA regulations explicitly require the LDso test, but manufacturers have developed a custom of using the test, based on an apparent misunderstanding of FDA requirements, to- gether with a desire to compile the data for use in the event of later product liability litigation. The Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environ- mental Protection Agency, and the Department of Transportation some- times require the test, in modified forms.34 A number of scientists and scien- tific societies have declared the test wasteful and overly crude, as compared with presently available alternatives. These opinions undermine the value of the test as premarketing evidence of a drug's safety or as protection against liability in subsequent lawsuits.35 Animal toxicity tests are often challenged as unnecessary, because infor- mation on toxicity can be obtained from other sources;36 as invalid, because humans and animals often react differently to agents;3" and as unreliable, be- cause evaluations of substances can vary widely among individual scorers.38 Scientists concerned about testing tend to focus on these matters and ask how wasteful testing can be eliminated. But Regan's animal rights view goes much further. Using animals to test product toxicity is never morally justi- fied, he argues. Human needs for new household and cosmetic products are minimal, particularly in light of these items' abundance. The harm we would experience "by being deprived of yet another Christmas tree spray or nail polish" is easily overridden by the suffering and death animals undergo as test subjects for these products (at 373). Neither does the economic harm to 32. Regan at 371, quoting Singer, supra note 7, at 48. 33. 21 U.S.C.A. ? 355(b) (1983). 34.

Moreover, by entering the free market and assuming its inherent risks, humans engaged in the industry have waived their right not to be made worse off from their activities. In addition, Regan argues that a pro- hibition on using animals for product testing would not necessarily yield fi- nancial disaster; rather, such action might stimulate an industry search for al- ternatives. Indeed, the search has already begun, for industry has both public relations and economic interests in finding alternatives to the costly animal tests. For example, in 1981 the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing was established with major funding from the cosmetics and toiletry industry." The rights view condemns drug as well as product toxicity testing on ani- mals. According to Regan, individuals who desire new drugs should them- selves bear the risks of toxicity (at 376-82). By choosing to take a new drug, an individual "voluntarily" waives his or her right to harm others to avoid being harmed from that choice. Regan acknowledges the moral risks entailed in a toxicity testing system that employs only human subjects. The ideal, he says, is to develop alternative tests requiring no moral agents or patients as subjects. In the meantime, however, the point remains: "To test [new drugs] on healthy [or unhealthy] human volunteers is dangerous at best; to test them coercively on healthy animals and human moral patients is wrong" (at 379). Any benefit such testing confers on others, animals or humans, is immate- rial, given the rights view's mandate to treat each individual with respect. Regan's assault on present scientific uses of animals does not cease with this controversial position on drug toxicity testing. He presses on to examine a human endeavor that has become almost sacred in our culture: scientific re- search. First, he joins with many other scientist and nonscientist commenta- tors in observing that a high percentage of research protocols harm animals without producing any health benefit or useful knowledge. But Regan then parts company with these critics, for the rights view cannot be satisfied with mere efforts at screening to determine which research projects are worth- while (at 383-94).40 On the rights view, we cannot justify harming a single rat merely by aggre- gating "the many human and humane benefits" that flow from doing it, since 39. Holden, supra note 31, at 36. See also Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Ex- periments, Alternatives to Laboratory Animals (U.K. organization and journal dedicated to promoting research for reducing suffering entailed in animal testing, replacing animal tests, and reducing numbers of animals used). 40. Screening a research project for its potential utility requires a prediction that may be inaccurate. See Jeri Sechzer, The Ethical Dilemma of Some Classical Animal Experiments, in Sechzer, supra note 15, at 5, 9-11. Yet the inevitability of some inaccuracy does not warrant rejecting this approach. Rollin argues that scientists can successfully review research for its theoretical support and potential for advancing scientific inquiry. Rollin, supra note 4, at 130-31.

(forthcoming).</page><page sequence="16">846 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 ... this is to assume that the rat has value only as a receptacle, which, on the rights view, is not true. Moreover, the benefits argument . . . is deficient. Not even a single rat is to be treated as if that animal's value were reducible to his possible utility relative to the interests of others, which is what we would be doing if we intentionally harmed the rat on the grounds that this just might "prove" something, just might "yield" a "new insight," just might produce "benefits" for others.4' In sum, the harm routinely imposed on animals in the name of scientific research violates their right to respect by treating them as if their value were a function of their possible utility to humans. Nor can we justify their use as a last resort after available alternatives are exhausted, for "[t]heir inherent val- ue does not disappear just because we have failed to find a way to avoid harming them in pursuit of our chosen goals" (at 385). Regan admits that many humans will challenge his position on intuitive grounds. Yet he believes such intuitive responses cannot withstand considered reflection, resting as they do on prejudicial and perfectionist notions (notions that would permit similar uses of human moral patients as research subjects). The rights view once again calls for total elimination of harmful research on animals and challenges scientists to seek alternatives, "to do science without violating anyone's rights, be they human or animal" (at 398). Regan alludes to a burgeoning movement aimed at curtailing the present virtually unrestricted use of animals in research. Groups calling for reform have increased their political activity in recent years; their efforts demon- strate that challenging the morality of research practices is neither eccentric nor totally unrealistic. On the legal and policy fronts, for instance, there is in- stitutional, state, national, and international activity. Most academic institu- tions have established animal research committees, which review procedures to ensure they are "humane and scientifically sound."42 Many committees have appointed nonscientist representatives as members, and efforts at strengthening committee standards appear to be increasing.43 An example of pertinent state legislation is California's statute prohibiting public elemen- tary and high schools from sponsoring painful and lethal experimentation on live vertebrate animals.44 In addition, in the past few years a great deal of federal legislation has been 41.

Past and present realities thus indicate that persons concerned with the interests and welfare of animal research subjects would be wise to make in- tense efforts to work with these scientists. In spite of their divergent theoreti- cal positions, cooperation is probably a necessity if any animals are actually to be spared suffering and death. In this vein, politically minded readers will find a helpful adjunct to Regan's work in Bernard Rollin's Animal Rights and Human Morality.54 Rollin is a philosopher who teaches ethics to veterinary and biology students. He takes a rights view resembling Regan's but qualifies it with a "socially in- evitable" utilitarian principle. The views combine in the following require- ments for research on animals: (1) the benefits to humans (or to humans and animals) must clearly outweigh the experimental animals' pain and suffering; and (2) such research must be implemented in a manner preserving the ani- mals' rights as much as possible, regardless of the monetary cost."55 Besides proposing several practical methods for reforming current scientific uses of animals, Rollin attends to the relationship between morality and law. He at- tempts to translate his ideas on moral rights and interests into specific legal claims, by offering amendments to the Animal Welfare Act and other sug- gestions for legislation, regulation, and judicial extensions of rights. Beyond acknowledging the presence of pragmatic constraints, must we ac- cept Regan's claim that the above reforms are insufficient, mere bandaids and compromises that fall short of "the moral heart of the matter"? (At 384) The present political efforts generally accept utility as a morally appropriate factor to weigh in determining which research protocols are permissible. Yet these reforms may also be cast in terms more harmonious with the rights view. Consider Regan's lifeboat examples. He asserts that one canine survi- vor, or one million canine survivors, may be thrown overboard to prevent the 51. These principles were first set forth in William M. S. Russell &amp; Rex L. Burch, The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique (London: Methuen, 1959): "Replacement means the substitution for conscious living higher animals of insentient material. Reduction means reduction in the numbers of ani- mals used to obtain information of given amount and precision. Refinement means any decrease in the in- cidence or severity of inhumane procedures applied to those animals which still have to be used." Id. at 64. 52. A few professional societies have recently formulated more protective guidelines for research on animals. E.g., Ethical Guidelines for Investigations of Experimental Pain in Conscious Animals, 16 Pain 109 (1983) (investigator should try most noninvasive pain stimuli on self; analgesics should be ad- ministered to laboratory animal). 53.

Similarly, if the lifeboat survivors will starve unless they kill one of their company for food, the rights view permits the humans to eat the dog. When Regan analyzes research on the lifeboat, he gives the human survi- vors a degenerative brain disease and a new medicine that may cure the hu- mans but may also have lethal side effects. The dog, meanwhile, is healthy. The rights view does not permit the humans to test the medicine on the dog, Regan says, because that would reduce the dog's value to his or her possible utility and would rest on perfectionist ideas that would in addition justify forcing the medicine on a fifth healthy human survivor who lacked the men- tal capacities or social value of the diseased survivors (at 385-87). But is there not a research analogy to the two earlier lifeboat cases? The justification for a great deal of research is its goal of preventing human suf- fering and death, harms Regan classifies as of greater magnitude than animal suffering and death. If the rights view allows the humans to throw the dog overboard to avoid their own drowning, or to eat the dog to avoid their star- vation, may not the dog, or for that matter one million dogs, be killed to pre- vent a human death from disease? Thus, for example, if the five lifeboat sur- vivors are all healthy, and if a lethal experiment performed on one subject would prevent an epidemic disease from killing the remaining survivors, the rights view would seem to permit the humans to force the dog to serve as the experimental subject. If this scenario is tainted with perfectionist notions, then so are the other two lifeboat cases. In his arguments on research, Regan claims we have "no basic right against nature not to be harmed by those natural diseases we are heir to" (at 388). Yet the other two lifeboat cases al- low the dog to be killed to avoid human death from such natural hazards as drowning and starvation. It is difficult to distinguish the grounds for harm- ing the dog in the latter situations from those present in the modified research case. In summary, applying rights view principles to the lifeboat case would seem to allow the use of animals as research subjects in exceptional circum- stances. Yet as Regan emphasizes, the lifeboat cases are exceptional. What is permissible in the rare prevention cases cannot be generalized to everyday life (at 352, 386-87). Current research practices incorporate the notion that near- ly every study using animals is a lifeboat case. But few studies actually qualify as lifeboat cases. In most instances, laboratory animals and humans are not equally vulnerable to the experimental disease; instead, humans coercively place the animals at risk to irivestigate peculiarly human conditions. More- over, laboratory animals are often made to suffer severe harms to avoid lesser harms to humans. The movement to lessen and refine research on ani- mals could reduce the huge disparity between current practices and the life- boat cases. The movement is evidence that our culture is becoming aware that its research practices are blatantly and indefensibly speciesist. The awareness is primitive, rough, and far from incorporating the restrictive standards the rights view would permit. But this recognition conceivably</page><page sequence="20">850 AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION RESEARCH JOURNAL 1984:831 could produce a review system based at least partially on the respect principle and other rights view principles.'56 We are a long way from adopting such a system, and as a practical matter it may be naive even to contemplate confining research on animals as strictly as the rights view would require. Regan concludes The Case for Animal Rights by acknowledging the powerful economic, legal, religious, and cul- tural impediments the animals rights movement faces. Political action is es- sential to implementation of moral philosophy. Regan labels the present po- litical activity on animal experimentation too weak to accommodate the rights view. But he fails to demonstrate that those taking the rights position must be abolitionists. By assuming a more extreme stance than the rights view demands, Regan may only increase the already formidable odds against its implementation. Some readers will criticize The Case for Animal Rights as politically unre- alistic. Yet Regan confronts us with a compelling moral challenge to our cur- rent attitudes and behavior toward animals. His skillful analysis and argu- ment add powerful theoretical fuel to the political fire. In this sense, Regan's exposure of our ill-considered moral beliefs may well contribute to the prac- tical efforts at narrowing the huge gap between animal rights and our present speciesist society.57 56. As noted earlier, Bernard Rollin offers two principles for reviewing research on animals, one of which incorporates the rights view. See infra text accompanying notes 54-55. An additional set of review standards devised in Sweden classifies biomedical experiments according to their intrusiveness to the research subjects and varies the level of review accordingly. Certain experiments involving severe pain or deprivation are deemed "unacceptable irrespective of the significance of anticipated results."

Regan's analysis focuses on various burdens he believes humans unjustly impose on animals. He does not explore the realm of distributive justice to determine what benefits animals might be owed under his principles.
