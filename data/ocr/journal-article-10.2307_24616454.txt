<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE NOBLE SENSE OF THE CURVE" FROM ANTIQUITY THROUGH BORROMINI Livio Pestilli, Trinity College, Rome Campus Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura Ché la diritta via era smarrita. Midway in the journey of our life I found myself in a dark wood, for the straight way was lost.1 Thus Dante, at the beginning of the Divine Comedy, describes metaphorically his divergence from the true, just, and upright path in life as a deviation from the straight way—a deviation that could only lead into the dark woods of human error and vices. To this day, at least in the English language, we still talk of "the straight and narrow" as the path of propriety and rectitude, and, not surprisingly, people refer to individuals as "straight" when their sexual preferences have not devi ated from society's accepted norm. For this reason, it is surprising to learn that about three hundred years after Dante wrote his verses, in Johannes Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Mystery of the Universe), first published in 1596, the curve represented a superior entity to the straight line (fig. 1). The astronomer's paragraph is noteworthy and merits full quotation. In describing the fabric of the universe, Kepler posits: It was matter which God created in the beginning; and if we know the definitions of matter, I think it will be fairly clear why God created matter and not any other thing in the beginning. I say that what God intended was quantity. To achieve it he needed everything which pertains to the essence of matter; and quantity is a form of matter, in virtue of its being matter, and the source of its definition. Now God decided that quantity should exist before all other things so that there should be a means of comparing a curved with a straight line. For in this one respect Nicholas of Cusa and others seem to me divine, that they attached so much importance to the relationship between a straight and curved line and dared to liken a curve to God, a straight line to his creatures; and those who tried to compare the Creator to his creature, God to Man, and divine judgments to human judgments did not perform much more valuable a service than those who tried to compare a curve with a straight line, a circle with a square. . . . But after all why were the distinctions between curved and straight, and the nobility of a curve, among God's intentions when he displayed the universe? Why indeed? Unless because by a most perfect Builder [Conditor] it was absolutely necessary that a most beautiful work should be produced.2 Nicholas of Cusa and others, then, were divinely inspired in Kepler's view because they dared to compare God to a curve and humanity to a straight line. Surprisingly, what we normally take as a symbol of deviation, the curve, was being used by some in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as a metaphor for the faultless Creator and, conversely, what we usually consider a symbol of perfection, ' Dante 1977, 3. 1 Kepler 1981, 93.

How did Kepler come to such conclusions? How had Dante's implicit praise of the "diritta via" given way to Kepler's encomium of a deviation from it by talking about "the noble sense of the curve"? Which were his sources? If the heavenly "most perfect Builder" had relied on curves and straight lines to create "a most beautiful work," could a reflection of these ideas be detected in sixteenth- and seventeenth century curvilinear architectural solutions? In the ancients' search and construct of first cosmic principles, they often relied for their ar gumentations on a basic dichotomy between species.3 According to Aristotle, for example, some 3 Arist. An. Post. 1.73b, 16-24: "Whatever, therefore, in the case of what is understandable simpliciter, is said to belong to things in themselves in the sense of inhering in the predicates or of being inhered in, holds both because of themselves and from necessity. For it is not possible for them not to belong, either simpliciter or as regards the opposites—e.g. straight or crooked to line, and odd or even to number."</page><page sequence="3">"THE NOBLE SENSE OF THE CURVE" FROM ANTIQUITY THROUGH BORROMINI 19 Pythagoreans maintained that there were ten principles of all things. These they arranged in binary opposition: "limit and unlimited, odd and even, one and plurality, right and left, male and female, resting and moving, straight and curved, light and darkness, good and bad, square and oblong."4 Although for these classical thinkers the combined contraries were the fundamental principles of the cosmos, semantically there is no doubt that in the ten pairs of contraries it is the first term that sets the standard. Thus, while it may be debatable from our point of view whether "limit" is a more positive concept than "unlimited," or whether "odd" is to be preferred to "even," there is no doubt that from the ancients' perspective "one" is preferable to "plurality," "right" to "left," "male" to "female," "resting" to "moving," "light" to "darkness," "good" to "bad," "square" to "oblong" and, of course, "straight" to "curved." On the other hand, thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle found the circle and circular motion perfect and the straight line and linear movement imperfect, for, if a straight line were infinite, it would lack a beginning and an end; if finite, there would be something outside itself, and the line could be extended.5 Semantically, however, in the pagan as well as in the Judeo-Christian world, the term "curved" carried with it a connotation of deficiency already mentioned in connection with the Pythagoreans. Thus, in describing his pursuit of a proper education in Athens, Horace stated that he "was eager to distinguish the straight from the crooked, and to hunt for truth in the groves of Academe."6 Similarly Persius, with tongue in cheek, scolds those readers who had gone amiss despite their better judgment by reminding them that they had "learnt how to distinguish the crooked from the straight," thereby differentiating the bad from the good in linear terms.7 Quite expectedly, the same dichotomy between a curved or depraved entity and a straight or healthy one appears in the Old and New Testaments. Isaiah, for example, enounces, "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain."8 Comparably, in Luke's story of the crippled woman who was healed by Christ after eighteen years of infirmity, the evangelist describes her as incurvata? Not surprisingly, when the Frankish Benedictine theologian Paschasius Radbertus (785-865) centuries later wrote his commentaries on the Gospel of St. Matthew, he too explained the weakness of the human soul and its inability to repel vices and sin by referring to its curved nature: "Indeed, if our soul were not curved, that is entangled by vices, demons would not have a passage through it; but because it offered a passage to them into itself, therefore whatever good is sown in it, evil seizes immediately."10 Quite expectedly also, by the time 4 Arist. Metaph. 1.985b 23-986b 4: "From both these schools [Alcmaeon of Croton's and Pythagoras's], then, we can learn this much, that the contraries are the principles of things; and how many these principles are and which they are, we can learn from one of the two schools" (986b 2-4). See Chen Morris 2009, 154-155 and n, 57. 5 PI. TV. 1164 33b-c: "And he [the Creator] gave to the world the figure which was suitable and also natural. Now to the animal which was to comprehend all animals, that figure would be suitable which comprehends all animals, that figure would be suitable which comprehends within itself all other figures. Wherefore he made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the center, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures, for he considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the unlike." See also Arist. Ph. 5.223a 18-24,227b 14-20, 265a 13-265b 16, 338a 4-18. Galilei 1988, 22-23: "Quanto poi quello [circular movement] sia più perfetto di questo [rectilinear movement], [Aristotle] lo determina dalla perfezion della linea circolare sopra la retta, chiamando quella perfetta, ed imperfetta questa; imperfetta, perché se è infinita, manca di fine e di termine; se è finita, fuori di lei ci è alcuna cosa dove ella si puô prolungare. Questa è la prima pietra, base e fondamento di tutta la fabbrica del mondo Aristotelico." 6Hor. Ep. 2.2.44^45: scilicet ut vellem curvo dinoscere rectum/ atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum.

While popularizing Alhazen s intromission theory of vision—that is, that vision is the result of light rays penetrating the eye, as opposed to the Euclidean and Ptolemaic extramission theory, which claimed that visual rays emanated from the viewer's eyes—Peter of Limoges, who wrote with the intention of moralizing optics for the benefit of preachers, draws theological conclusions from the idea that straight rays generate a true vision, whereas bent rays reflect a distortion, both visually and morally.14 Among the classic examples of incorrect vision or optical illusion, of course, he includes the stick that, partly submerged in water, appears bent.15 For Peter, only after resurrection "would man be able to have vision through straight lines alone."16 Thus, in the West there was a long, well-established tradition that assigned both a positive and a negative significance to the curve. If philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle in their explanations of metaphysical ideas were ready to emphasize the perfection of the circle as an appropriate attribute of the divinity, and consequently the superiority of the curved over the straight line, on a semantic level curves or bent lines implied a shortcoming or a moral deviation that has persisted to the present. A more positive appreciation of curves seems to occur in the specialized world of mathemati cians and geometers in the fourth and third century B.C., when significant studies of curves and their respective qualities were carried out by a number of scholars such Menaechmus (ca. 380-ca. 320), Aristaeus (ca. 370-ca. 300), and Archimedes (ca. 287-ca. 212), with Euclid (fl. 300 B.c.) devoting the whole third book of his Elements to the subject.17 Flowever, the most influential investigation of per earn daemones non bavèrent; sed quia eis transitum in se praebuit, proptera quidquid seminatur in ea boni, continuo malus rapit.

Diagram of Conic Sections. the nature of curves was Apollonius of Perga's (ca. 262-ca. 190) Conies, or Conic Sections—a work that gained him the epithet of the "Great Geometer."18 It was he who was responsible for defining the geometrical shapes that are generated by the intersection of a plane through a cone at different angles, and the terms he codified are the ones still in use today: that is, hyperbola, parabola, and el lipse (fig. 2). The significance of his work may be gathered by the fact that, although it was primarily a theoretical treatise, it formed the basis of Kepler's practical application of these concepts, when he used the ellipse to explain the orbit of the planets. The most tangible and sophisticated response to this fascination with curves in an architectural context had to wait about three hundred years when architects such as Celer and Severus under Nero, and Rabirius under Domitian, began swinging their compasses and liberating their imagi nation from the fetters that the planar, classical tradition had bequeathed them. But it was under Hadrian that the attraction for curvilinear designs reached one of the highest peaks in the history of architecture, as seen especially in the Water Court in the so-called Piazza d'Oro at Hadrian's Villa (fig. 3). The sinuous, fluid layout adopted in this most engaging design—a logical evolution from the reverse-curve plans of spaces such as the Island Enclosure also in Hadrian's Villa—is a clear sign, as has been suggested, "of new structural forms... a reliable index of serious architec tural change" (fig. 4)19 Certainly, the Roman development of concrete construction was a catalyst in this architectural evolution. Nonetheless, the mindset that subsumes such an attraction for the curvilinear in its application to architecture is probably best revealed not so much by a work on geometry or architecture as by one on oratory: Quintilian's Institutio oratoria of about A.D. 95. Indeed, in addressing students on how to vary their speech so as to obtain the greatest impact on their listeners, he advises: It is often expedient and occasionally becoming to make some modification in the time-honored order. We see the same thing in pictures and statues. Dress, expression, and attitude are fre quendy varied. The body when held bolt upright has but little grace, for the face looks straight forward, the arms hang by the side, the feet are joined, and the whole figure is stiff from top to toe. But that curve, I might almost call it motion, with which we are so familiar, gives an impres sion of action and animation.... Where can we find a more violent and elaborate attitude than that of the Discobolus of Myron? Yet the critic who disapproved of the figure because it was not upright, would merely show his utter failure to understand the sculptor's art, in which the very novelty and difficulty of execution is what most deserves our praise. A similar impression 18Bulmer-Thomas 1939-1941,2:279-281 transcribes a por tion of Eutocius's Commentary on Apollonius's Conies: "But later Apollonius of Perga proved generally that all the sec tions can be obtained in any cone, whether right or scalene, according to different relations of the plane to the cone. In admiration for this, and on account of the remarkable nature of the theorems in conics proved by him, his contemporaries called him the 'Great Geometer'." 19MacDonald and Pinto 1995, 92.</page><page sequence="6">5 □ [ Fig. 3.

For they involve a certain departure from the straight line and have the merit of variation from the ordinary usage}0 The significance of this statement can hardly be overestimated. Quintilian's emphasis on the curve— the "Praxitelian S" or even the serpentine figure in sculpture—and its divergence from the beaten path of the straight line, the expected, the ordinary, is what constituted the appeal of such different compositions as the Discobolus (fig. 5).21 Along with all of the technical reasons why curvilinear spatial solutions became so favored by the Romans, no doubt there was also this positive apprecia tion of the surprising, the unusual, the diverse, and the unexpected. Although anachronistic, it is not inappropriate to define this mindset as a true baroque sensibility, ante litteram.22 20 Quint. Inst. 2.13.8-12. My italics. 21 Shearman 1977, 81-85. 22 An echo of this desire for unity in variety one finds even in a text where, on the surface at least, one might not expect it. In discussing the concept of beauty in Greece, Winckelmann claimed that its appearance could be found either in the in dividual, where one would first notice it, or in the ideal. This ideal the Greek artists found in the gymnasiums where the youth used to practice various sports naked, and especially in the male youth "in whom both sexes were mingled." He then goes on to say: "In the beautiful youth, the artist found the source of beauty in unity, variety, and harmony—for the forms of a beautiful body are defined by lines that continually change their center point, never tracing a circle, and thus the</page><page sequence="8">24 LIVIO PESTILLI toAKNIS KeFLBKi Io A N NI S KEFLSRI 1/ Fig. 6.

While similar considerations may be at the root of curvilinear architectural projects even in later centuries, again, in society at large the idea that the curve is a deviation from the norm remained a constant. Thus, when Kepler claimed that Nicholas of Cusa and others seemed to him so divine because "they attached so much importance to the relationship between a straight and curved line and dared to liken a curve to God, a straight line to his creatures," it is clear that for Kepler this was a bold, divinely inspired assumption, which he found in contrast with common opinion. How ever, these authors could obtain a positive appreciation of the curved line only by harking back to the world of philosophers, mathematicians, and geometers like Apollonius of Perga, whose highly specialized, abstract studies such as his Conies would help them transcend the negative connotations attached to a bent line.23 Indeed, Nicholas of Cusa claimed that "in a circle oneness and infinity coincide" and that the circle was "the ultimate and most simple and most perfect thing—the thing most like the Creator."24 Ultimately, for him "infinite straightness ... is also an infinite circle."25 Kepler's contribution to the age-old dichotomy between straight and curved came in his treat ment of conic sections in Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena (1604), where he "unifies these contradictory elements into one geometrical continuum" (fig. 6).26For, without recourse to the ancient idea of a forms are simpler but also more varied than a circle, which, however large or small it may be, always has the same center point and encloses others within itself or is itself enclosed. This variety was sought by the Greeks in works of every kind, and their system of discernment appears as well in the forms of their vessels and vases, whose svelte and elegant contours follow the same rule, that is, they were drawn with a line that must be determined by several circles: for all these works have an elliptical shape, and herein resides their beauty. The greater the unity in the combination of forms, and in the flowing of one from the other, the greater the beauty of the whole."

Andrea in Via Flaminia (1550-ca. 1553) is the first edifice to display an elliptical dome supported by a rectangular lower tier (figs. 8-9). In his plan for S. Anna dei Palafrenieri (designs begun ca. 1568), however, the interior walls of the church itself were plied to create an oval shape, which was most likely dictated by the artist's concetto and 27 Quoted in Chen-Morris 2009, 155. 28 Kepler 1977, xiii. 29 Kepler 1977,4:305. 30 Hersey 2000, 4. 31 See Serlio 1996, 402.</page><page sequence="10">26 LIVIO PESTILLI Fig. 10.

Anna dei Palafrenieri (designs begun ca. 1568) (from Heydenreich and Lotz 1974, 276). not by function or location of the building (fig. 10).32 These precedents notwithstanding, it was, of course, in churches designed in the seventeenth century by Bernini and, more so, Borromini that such elliptical solutions acquired, especially thanks to Kepler's writings and astronomic discoveries, greater cosmic or "heavenly" symbolism.33 In George Hersey's Architecture and Geometry in the Age of the Baroque, after having described how Borromini's elliptical design for the Church of S. Carlino was probably derived from Serlio's system of drawing ovals, the author claims, "in fact, [Borromini's design] is remarkably like Kepler's diagram of a planet's elliptical orbit."34 Soon after, though, he qualifies his statements by saying, "let me hasten at once to add that I doubt very much that San Carlino was intended to proclaim the gospel of elliptical orbits. We are dealing here with the sort of coincidences that arise independently in the course of geometrical play."35 Although Hersey's assumption is probably correct and mindful of Joseph Connors's admonishment that in Borromini's case architectural precedents, both ancient and Renaissance, are "more relevant than loose-fitting emblems and cosmic diagrams," there is no doubt that this architect was sufficiently sophisticated not to ignore that his geometric solutions would quite likely be read symbolically by contemporaries, especially as he himself was wont to assign symbolic significance to his buildings and their decorative details.36 Similarly, he must have been just as aware of the biblical and art historical traditions that, if on the one hand saw God as the Architectus Mundi, as in the French thirteenth-century Bible Moralisée and a drawing by Cherubino Alberti, on the other hand also warranted the inverse analogy that viewed the architect as an alter deus (figs. 11-12). We do not know if in his personal library, comprising nearly one thousand books, Borromini had a copy of Kepler's Astronomia Nova (1609), in which the scientist discloses his discovery that 32 Heydenreich and Lotz 1974, 277.

"the course of a planet in the heavens is not a circle, but an oval path, perfectly elliptical."37 Nor do we know for certain if he ever read Kepler's ideas articulated in the Mysterium Cosmographicum, where he discusses the comparison between the straight line and the curved. Nonetheless, we can be sure that at least some members of Roman society were perfectly attuned to the scientific dis coveries. Federico Cesi, for example, in a letter to Galileo praises their common friend Ludovico Cigoli for having painted a scientifically correct, maculated moon under the feet of the Immaculate Virgin in the Pauline Chapel in Santa Maria Maggiore "nel modo che da V[ostra] S[signoria] è stata scoperta con la divisione merlata e le sue isolette."38 Surely, even if Borromini had not intended to incorporate in his architectural compositions any allusion to Kepler's ideas, the educated view ers, especially those well versed in science and geometry, upon entering the Church of S. Ivo or S. Carlino and lifting their eyes to the alternating curves and straight lines of the entablature and 57 Kepler 2004, 86. Wittkower 1975, 156 and 291 η. 18. Borromini probably knew a little Latin, but even if he did not read these works directly himself, as Beldon Scott points out with reference to the Latin orations and their symbolic or metaphorical imagery that would have influenced his use of decorative details, "most probably he was informally advised on such matters by the patrons or an individual in their charge." See Beldon Scott 1982, 315. Joseph Connors kindly informed me that Paolo Maruscelli (d. 1649) in his personal library had Euclid, Grienberger, Clavius, Comman dino, Guidobaldo del Monte, and Galileo, "though only for the Geometrical Compass and not the astronomical works." Thus, it is not unreasonable to assume that Borromini, who had "five or six times as many books," would have had a copy of Kepler's writings. ,s Gabrieli 1996,301 in a letter from Rome dated 23 Decem ber 1612: "Il s. Cigoli s'è portato divinamente nella cupola délia cappella di S. S.tà a S. Maria Maggiore, e come buon amico e leale, ha sotto l'imagine della Beata Vergine, pinto la luna nel modo che da V.S. è stata scoperta con la divisione merlata e le sue isolette.

Ivo, interior, 1642-1650 (photo author). beyond to the curvilinear domes, would have seen in these details an echo of this scientist's concepts and discoveries (figs. 13-14).39 And, quite likely, these same visitors would have seen Borromini as the human counterpart of that "most perfect Builder" of the universe, as Kepler would say, since in these churches he had achieved comparable most beautiful microcosms. There were probably many persons who felt this way, but we are certain that at least one very informed viewer did. In his history of the monastic complex, Fra Giovanni di S. Bonaventura, who was Procurator General of the Monastery of S. Carlo aile Quattro Fontane during the period that Borromini worked there, did not fail to see such analogies between the heavenly and earthly builder. Developing his own psychology of vision, he compares the experience one undergoes when contemplating Borromini's architecture to the tireless heavenly vision angels experience when contemplating the Divinity. He maintains that, contrary to what one feels when inside some other magnificent churches, such as St. Peter's, S. Maria Maggiore, the Gesù, and S. Carlo ai Catinari, where the viewer does not "crave" to see them a second time, one never tires of Borromini's S. Carlino as it partakes "of the Divine essence"—"tenga qualche cossa [k'c] di imitazione—in quanto si puô dire—di Divinità."40 That viewers may still share Fra Giovanni's opinion when contemplating Borromini's churches today is due as much to this architect's artistic vision as to his technical, geometric genius, his evocative use of the "noble sense of the curve" and of the interplay between straight and curved lines. 39 Connors 1996, 52 points out how the Barberini court was particularly fond of "gentlemen's geometry, pursued as a demanding pastime, deriving from innovative science." 40 Steinberg 1960, 214: "E vero che sono edifici magnifici, ma visti la prima volta non resta apetito di vederla 2a Questa di S. Carlo si, che mai da fastidio, sempre pare che sia nova, come Beda disse della essenza divina: Dunche umbra pare che ha questa chiesa di divinità; che talmenta sacia [i.e., sazia] e da gusto vista, che lascia apetito di vederla." See also Wittkower 1975, 171 (appendix II) and 169, where he specifies that Fra Giovanni di S. Bonaventura was Procura tor General of the monastery from 1647 to 1650 and 1653 to 1656. He died in 1658.</page><page sequence="13">"THE NOBLE SENSE OF THE CURVE" FROM ANTIQUITY THROUGH BORROMINI 29 Bibliography Aristotle, The Complete Works of Aristotle, 2 vols, ed. J.
