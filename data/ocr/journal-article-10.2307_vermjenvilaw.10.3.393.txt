   <page sequence="1"> TO THE LIGHTHOUSE  Donald M. Kreis*  “So it was like that, James thought, the Lighthouse one had seen across  the bay all these years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock.  It satisfied him.   It confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character.”1    Virginia Woolf presumably did not set out to write a paean to  infrastructure when she began work on the provocative and haunting novel  she published in 1927, about the Ramsay family and certain events at the  family’s summer home on the Isle of Skye in Scotland.  And yet the book,  considered a landmark of twentieth century literature, coalesces around the  family’s thwarted sailing trip, followed by a successful trip a decade later,  to a man-made nautical landmark.2  To the Lighthouse is about many things, described by Woolf in a poetic,  stream-of-consciousness manner that is not unduly tethered to the once- prevailing conventions of plot and storytelling.3  And so, Woolf required a  unifying, eponymous image.  Thus her novel, so steeped in concern for the  inner life of her characters, the sometimes self-defeating facets of their  relationships to one another, and their shared connection to the natural  landscape in which they summered, became a tribute to a big piece of  industrial equipment.4  We, of course, are no more inclined than Woolf was to think of  lighthouses as looming mechanical interventions in the landscape of the  seashore.  Still, they were built not for their postcard allure, but as aids to                                                                                                                 * Assistant Professor of Law and Associate Director, Institute for Energy and the  Environment, Vermont Law School.

Our affection for lighthouses is not innate.  The beacons and the  structures that house them are neither anthropomorphic nor evocative of  anything else from the natural world.  That we appreciate and cherish them  nonetheless, even to the point of preserving them in their now-vestigial  form7 in the face of forces that would restore the landscape to its natural  state,8 offers hope to those who wonder whether the U.S. will summon the  requisite resources to make necessary improvements to the nation’s  benighted infrastructure.  The trick will be in discovering how to inspire  affection for newly built instruments of civilization to rival the esteem in  which we hold artifacts of economies past: objects like lighthouses, barns,  silos, water wheels, and railroad trestles.  Such a discovery is of practical importance as the need for economic  stimulus, the crisis occasioned by decades of underinvestment in common  machinery of civilization, and the imperative to confront climate change  combine to place infrastructure improvements at or near the top of the  national agenda.9  But the discovery also has moral significance if the  nation is to meet President Obama’s biblically-inspired inaugural challenge  to “set aside childish things.”10  “[H]eightened claims of individual autonomy have eviscerated the  concept of citizenship,” historian Andrew J.

We can start by learning to see, and even to explore, what is already  there.  For example, consider the Tappan Zee Bridge, which has, carried the  New York Thruway across the Hudson River just north of New York City  since 1955.13  As the road network in the Northeast has evolved, this particular bridge  has assumed an ever more crucial role.14  Apart from its significance as a  commuter artery, the Tappan Zee Bridge is the best option for long-distance  travel between New England and points south and west because it allows  vehicles to bypass congested New York City itself without deviating too  drastically from the Interstate 95 corridor.15  Although derided by its own  designers as the ugliest bridge in the region, and one built to last only fifty  years,16 the Tappan Zee Bridge has remarkable attributes: its sheer length  (slightly more than three miles, crossing the second widest portion of the  river); the two undulating curves along its route; a remarkable climb from  Nyack to the bridge’s cantilever span near the Westchester shore—how  many bridges include a hill?—and the astonishingly 1,212 foot width of the  cantilever span itself—a watery-aisle four football fields wide—created to  accommodate the shipping lane beneath the bridge.17                                                                                                                 11.

In truth, one’s jaw only drops if  travelling beneath the bridge on a boat of some kind.  From that vantage  point, carrying all that traffic across 1,212 feet of air, 138 feet above the  river, seems downright miraculous.21  The world, near and far, is rich with such industrial and engineering  achievements merely waiting to be savored.  For example, just a few miles  from the campus of Vermont Law School is the Ledyard Bridge, connecting  Norwich, Vermont and Hanover, New Hampshire; it was completed in  2000 as an off-the-shelf highway bridge but it is decorated with eight  outsized concrete orbs which, in combination with their pedestals, resemble  giant Newell posts.22  On the Chicago River are two circular apartment towers of sixty-five  stories, built in the early 1960s to resemble corn cobs.23 What makes this  project remarkable as infrastructure is the first nineteen stories of each  tower is taken up by a parking facility that winds its way upward as a  continuous, open-air ramp that creates, in effect, a public display of urban  automobile preferences.24  Along the East River Drive, near 90th Street in Manhattan, is a concrete  structure that appears to be a scaled-down and filled-in version of the                                                                                                                 18.

We lawyers face a particular challenge as we discharge our duty to seek  a renewed national commitment to infrastructure.  With few exceptions, a  lack of scientific and technical inclinations played a significant role in our  career choices.  A tour of duty at most any state utility regulatory agency  will quickly confirm that, as a result, attorneys and engineers can have an  especially difficult time communicating with each other on matters of  mutual professional interest.  What self-respecting energy lawyer would  admit to being lost in a power-system substation or even a photograph or  diagram thereof?  A fine antidote to this problem is Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the  Industrial Landscape by Brian Hayes.34  Touted by its science journalist  author as a volume in the form of a “nature guide” but one that concerns  “everything that isn’t nature,”35 Hayes proceeds from the laudable premise  that industrial interventions are fascinating and often beautiful.36  Here is an  opportunity to develop sufficient visual literacy so as to be dangerous.  One discovers, for example, that substations exist mainly to take high- voltage electricity (useful in that form for ease of transmission over long  distances) and transform it (via, appropriately enough, transformers) to  lower, more customer-friendly voltages for distribution.37  The  characteristic latticework consists of scaffolding and “bus bars,” sets of  parallel conductors that carry current from one conductor to the next  through rigid metal tubes, their complexity trebled because each circuit has  three phases.38  A substation “functions like the fuse box in your basement,”39 but, at  high voltage, merely opening the breaker is insufficient to extinguish the  current because “[e]lectricity will cheerfully jump across the gap, forming a  white-hot arc, which then proceeds to melt the whole mess.”40  Substation  switches, therefore, are formidable objects that tend to resemble giant spark  plugs; they contain oil or sulfur hexafluoride—a gas designed to quench the  arc when the circuit opens.41  Others, even more intriguingly, are equipped                                                                                                                 33.

Some  understanding of the purposes served by these elements, and how they  work, is not merely a means to greater aesthetic appreciation of the world as  humanity has decisively altered it.  One can entertain the children on boring  car journeys, yes, but one also engages in an act of self-empowerment.  Still, we should not be expected to embrace our infrastructure unless it  and its designers meet us halfway.  The examples referenced above—the  Ledyard Bridge, Marina City in Chicago, the municipal asphalt plant in  Manhattan, the solar telescope in Arizona, and the railroad signal tower in  Basel—are all examples of projects created with laudable attentiveness to  their visual impacts.  All too often, our master builders have been stolid in  their obliviousness to the effects their interventions have on the landscape.  At the extreme is Robert Moses, the so-called “master builder” of New  York City and environs.  Although responsible, inter alia, for a bucolic  network of parkways43Riverside Park in Manhattan (a covered-over  railroad line),44 and the 1964-1965 World’s Fair45this powerful  government official is perhaps most famous for ramming a dismal sunken  highway—the Cross Bronx Expressway—straight through the heart of the  borough whose name it bears, decimating one of its most vibrant  neighborhoods.46  Convinced that succeeding generations would be grateful,  he memorably pointed out that when building new infrastructure in an  existing metropolis, as opposed to a wilderness, “you have to hack your  way with a meat ax.”47  Moses has had many kindred spirits—officials and designers so  convinced of the necessity and virtue of their plans, so driven by the  imperative to make public works projects acceptable to tax-averse polities  and return-hungry investors, that nothing as prosaic as mere ugliness could  stop them.  Have we yet seen a nuclear power plant designed with an eye                                                                                                                 42. Id. at 257.   43.

It is no coincidence that the Tappan Zee Bridge, whose designers bragged  about their indifference to the aesthetic appeal of the work, arose during the same era as the Cross Bronx  Expressway.  As Robert Caro’s biography of Moses meticulously documents, notions of engineering  efficiency seemed during this era to trump any concern for effects that are experienced at the scale of  individual people.

Regrettably, such indifference to the way in which people are affected  by the engineered objects in their midst has not merely engendered  obliviousness as everyday people look inward for signs of beauty.  Public  thinkers have responded by promoting hostility to the efforts of those who  would demand a higher standard for our infrastructure.  For example, the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan laudably complained in  1969 of   a steady deterioration in the quality of public buildings and  spaces, and with it a decline in the symbols of public unity  and common purpose with which the citizen can identify,  of which he can be proud, and by which he can know what  he shares with his fellow citizens.49  In a book published two years later, After the Planners, architect and urban  planner Robert Goodman juxtaposed Moynihan’s comments with a  complaint by Adolph Hitler that “our cities of the present lack the symbol  of national community which, we must therefore not be surprised to find,  sees no symbol of itself in the cities.”50  Goodman fancied himself a “guerrilla architect,” as he embodied the  counter-cultural zeitgeist of his era.51  But if his juxtapositions were  amusingly subtle, ultimately this contempt for the prevailing design  imperatives of his day found their way into popular culture, delivered in  one memorable instance by a blunt instrument indeed: the pen of popular                                                                                                                 48.

Staff writer David Owen of The New Yorker magazine went from being  an obscure golf writer to semi-famous environmental provocateur in 2004  when he published an article proclaiming Manhattan a “utopian  community” that is, “in comparison with the rest of America . . . a model of  environmental responsibility.”55 He declared that New York City was “the  greenest community in the United States.”56  To make his point, Owen compared his current existence, in an  eighteenth century farmhouse on a dirt road in rural Connecticut, to his  former, automobile-free life in a 700-square-foot Manhattan apartment.57   Calling the move an “ecological catastrophe,” Owen pointed out that “if  you made all eight million New Yorkers live at the density of my town,  they would require a space equivalent to the land area of the six New  England states plus Delaware and New Jersey.”58  The author’s plausible  contention is that those eight million people, so arrayed, would increase  their use of energy by an order of magnitude.59  Thus, Owen reasoned,  “[t]he environmental challenge we face, at the current stage of our assault  on the world’s non-renewable resources, is not how to make our teeming  cities more like the pristine countryside.  The true challenge is how to make  other settled places more like Manhattan.”60                                                                                                                 52.

And it means infrastructure that is attentive  to the concerns Senator Moynihan expressed in 1969.61  It cannot be a  coincidence that the nation’s largest producer of electric power, more than  sixty years after its creation in the crucible of the New Deal, is the  Tennessee Valley Authority.62  This massive public works initiative was so  noteworthy as a design that New York’s Museum of Modern Art held an  exhibition on the TVA in 1941, prompting historian and cultural critic  Lewis Mumford to praise the TVA’s designs in The New Yorker magazine  as “breathtaking . . . as close to perfection as our age has come.”63  Perhaps the most crucial thing that the designers of our infrastructure  can do is to suffuse their projects with honesty, eschewing artifice.  New  York’s grand suspension bridge, the George Washington, is especially  beloved because the planned masonry cladding for the bridge’s two massive  towers was never built, leaving satisfyingly visible evidence of the  powerful structure that holds up the giant Hudson River crossing.64  In  Columbus, Indiana, a haven of architectural excellence, architect Myron  Goldsmith took the bold step of creating an industrial building with one  entire façade of glass, the better to show off the newspaper printing presses  within.65  Similarly, the muscular concrete dams of the TVA require little  explanation to those curious about how so much energy is produced.  In his lucidly persuasive disquisition on the connection between  architecture and human happiness, the writer Alain de Botton describes a  train trip that took him across the Salginatobel Bridge, near Schiers in  Switzerland.66  Now nearly 70-years old, the 269-foot span across an alpine  chasm has become an icon of reinforced concrete as used in an arch  bridge,67 so nimbly does it make its leap.68  According to de Botton, the  Salginatobel Bridge    testifies to how closely a certain kind of beauty is bound up  with our admiration for man-made objects which can                                                                                                                 61.

We see beauty in thick slate roofs that challenge  hailstones to do their worst, in sea defences that shrug off  the waves which batter them, and in bolts, rivets, cables,  beams and buttresses.  We feel moved by edifices— cathedrals, skyscrapers, hangars, tunnels, pylons—which  compensate for our inadequacies, our inability to cross  mountains or carry cables between cities.  We respond with  emotion to creations which transport us across distances we  could never walk, which shelter us during storms we could  not weather, which pick up signals we could never hear  with our own ears and which hang daintily off cliffs from  which we would fall instantly to our deaths.69  Are we losing the capacity for this kind of admiration?  De Botton is a vigilant observer of things; he marvels at how his train,  crossing the bridge, “makes its way over the gap, and through a small  cloud, with the brisk formality one might associate with the most routine of  activities.”70  He pronounces the span the very embodiment of elegance,  which he defines as “a subcategory of beauty” in which a work of  architecture “succeeds in carrying out an act of resistance—holding,  spanning, sheltering—with grace and economy as well as strength; when it  has the modesty not to draw attention to the difficulties it has  surmounted.”71  It is reasonable to assume that, in the England and Scotland  of the early twentieth century, people gazed at lighthouses and properly  understood them as their own acts of resistance against what was then the  very real possibility of perilous navigational error.  To the Lighthouse, after  all, followed the sinking of the Titanic by only fifteen years.72  Today we perceive lighthouses as quaint, much as we regard windmills,  silos, steam locomotives, and old-fashioned ballparks.  But wind turbines,  arguably as elegant as the Salginatobel Bridge, so lightly do they carry their  burden of generating electricity from natural forces at megawatt scale, are  derided as unwelcome changes to the natural landscape when they threaten  to alter the view of Nantucket Sound, enjoyed by the descendants of Joseph                                                                                                                 69.

   <page sequence="14"> TO THE LIGHTHOUSE  Donald M. Kreis*  “So it was like that, James thought, the Lighthouse one had seen across  the bay all these years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock.  It satisfied him.   It confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character.”1    Virginia Woolf presumably did not set out to write a paean to  infrastructure when she began work on the provocative and haunting novel  she published in 1927, about the Ramsay family and certain events at the  family’s summer home on the Isle of Skye in Scotland.  And yet the book,  considered a landmark of twentieth century literature, coalesces around the  family’s thwarted sailing trip, followed by a successful trip a decade later,  to a man-made nautical landmark.2  To the Lighthouse is about many things, described by Woolf in a poetic,  stream-of-consciousness manner that is not unduly tethered to the once- prevailing conventions of plot and storytelling.3  And so, Woolf required a  unifying, eponymous image.  Thus her novel, so steeped in concern for the  inner life of her characters, the sometimes self-defeating facets of their  relationships to one another, and their shared connection to the natural  landscape in which they summered, became a tribute to a big piece of  industrial equipment.4  We, of course, are no more inclined than Woolf was to think of  lighthouses as looming mechanical interventions in the landscape of the  seashore.  Still, they were built not for their postcard allure, but as aids to                                                                                                                 * Assistant Professor of Law and Associate Director, Institute for Energy and the  Environment, Vermont Law School.

Our affection for lighthouses is not innate.  The beacons and the  structures that house them are neither anthropomorphic nor evocative of  anything else from the natural world.  That we appreciate and cherish them  nonetheless, even to the point of preserving them in their now-vestigial  form7 in the face of forces that would restore the landscape to its natural  state,8 offers hope to those who wonder whether the U.S. will summon the  requisite resources to make necessary improvements to the nation’s  benighted infrastructure.  The trick will be in discovering how to inspire  affection for newly built instruments of civilization to rival the esteem in  which we hold artifacts of economies past: objects like lighthouses, barns,  silos, water wheels, and railroad trestles.  Such a discovery is of practical importance as the need for economic  stimulus, the crisis occasioned by decades of underinvestment in common  machinery of civilization, and the imperative to confront climate change  combine to place infrastructure improvements at or near the top of the  national agenda.9  But the discovery also has moral significance if the  nation is to meet President Obama’s biblically-inspired inaugural challenge  to “set aside childish things.”10  “[H]eightened claims of individual autonomy have eviscerated the  concept of citizenship,” historian Andrew J.

We can start by learning to see, and even to explore, what is already  there.  For example, consider the Tappan Zee Bridge, which has, carried the  New York Thruway across the Hudson River just north of New York City  since 1955.13  As the road network in the Northeast has evolved, this particular bridge  has assumed an ever more crucial role.14  Apart from its significance as a  commuter artery, the Tappan Zee Bridge is the best option for long-distance  travel between New England and points south and west because it allows  vehicles to bypass congested New York City itself without deviating too  drastically from the Interstate 95 corridor.15  Although derided by its own  designers as the ugliest bridge in the region, and one built to last only fifty  years,16 the Tappan Zee Bridge has remarkable attributes: its sheer length  (slightly more than three miles, crossing the second widest portion of the  river); the two undulating curves along its route; a remarkable climb from  Nyack to the bridge’s cantilever span near the Westchester shore—how  many bridges include a hill?—and the astonishingly 1,212 foot width of the  cantilever span itself—a watery-aisle four football fields wide—created to  accommodate the shipping lane beneath the bridge.17                                                                                                                 11.

In truth, one’s jaw only drops if  travelling beneath the bridge on a boat of some kind.  From that vantage  point, carrying all that traffic across 1,212 feet of air, 138 feet above the  river, seems downright miraculous.21  The world, near and far, is rich with such industrial and engineering  achievements merely waiting to be savored.  For example, just a few miles  from the campus of Vermont Law School is the Ledyard Bridge, connecting  Norwich, Vermont and Hanover, New Hampshire; it was completed in  2000 as an off-the-shelf highway bridge but it is decorated with eight  outsized concrete orbs which, in combination with their pedestals, resemble  giant Newell posts.22  On the Chicago River are two circular apartment towers of sixty-five  stories, built in the early 1960s to resemble corn cobs.23 What makes this  project remarkable as infrastructure is the first nineteen stories of each  tower is taken up by a parking facility that winds its way upward as a  continuous, open-air ramp that creates, in effect, a public display of urban  automobile preferences.24  Along the East River Drive, near 90th Street in Manhattan, is a concrete  structure that appears to be a scaled-down and filled-in version of the                                                                                                                 18.

We lawyers face a particular challenge as we discharge our duty to seek  a renewed national commitment to infrastructure.  With few exceptions, a  lack of scientific and technical inclinations played a significant role in our  career choices.  A tour of duty at most any state utility regulatory agency  will quickly confirm that, as a result, attorneys and engineers can have an  especially difficult time communicating with each other on matters of  mutual professional interest.  What self-respecting energy lawyer would  admit to being lost in a power-system substation or even a photograph or  diagram thereof?  A fine antidote to this problem is Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the  Industrial Landscape by Brian Hayes.34  Touted by its science journalist  author as a volume in the form of a “nature guide” but one that concerns  “everything that isn’t nature,”35 Hayes proceeds from the laudable premise  that industrial interventions are fascinating and often beautiful.36  Here is an  opportunity to develop sufficient visual literacy so as to be dangerous.  One discovers, for example, that substations exist mainly to take high- voltage electricity (useful in that form for ease of transmission over long  distances) and transform it (via, appropriately enough, transformers) to  lower, more customer-friendly voltages for distribution.37  The  characteristic latticework consists of scaffolding and “bus bars,” sets of  parallel conductors that carry current from one conductor to the next  through rigid metal tubes, their complexity trebled because each circuit has  three phases.38  A substation “functions like the fuse box in your basement,”39 but, at  high voltage, merely opening the breaker is insufficient to extinguish the  current because “[e]lectricity will cheerfully jump across the gap, forming a  white-hot arc, which then proceeds to melt the whole mess.”40  Substation  switches, therefore, are formidable objects that tend to resemble giant spark  plugs; they contain oil or sulfur hexafluoride—a gas designed to quench the  arc when the circuit opens.41  Others, even more intriguingly, are equipped                                                                                                                 33.

Some  understanding of the purposes served by these elements, and how they  work, is not merely a means to greater aesthetic appreciation of the world as  humanity has decisively altered it.  One can entertain the children on boring  car journeys, yes, but one also engages in an act of self-empowerment.  Still, we should not be expected to embrace our infrastructure unless it  and its designers meet us halfway.  The examples referenced above—the  Ledyard Bridge, Marina City in Chicago, the municipal asphalt plant in  Manhattan, the solar telescope in Arizona, and the railroad signal tower in  Basel—are all examples of projects created with laudable attentiveness to  their visual impacts.  All too often, our master builders have been stolid in  their obliviousness to the effects their interventions have on the landscape.  At the extreme is Robert Moses, the so-called “master builder” of New  York City and environs.  Although responsible, inter alia, for a bucolic  network of parkways43Riverside Park in Manhattan (a covered-over  railroad line),44 and the 1964-1965 World’s Fair45this powerful  government official is perhaps most famous for ramming a dismal sunken  highway—the Cross Bronx Expressway—straight through the heart of the  borough whose name it bears, decimating one of its most vibrant  neighborhoods.46  Convinced that succeeding generations would be grateful,  he memorably pointed out that when building new infrastructure in an  existing metropolis, as opposed to a wilderness, “you have to hack your  way with a meat ax.”47  Moses has had many kindred spirits—officials and designers so  convinced of the necessity and virtue of their plans, so driven by the  imperative to make public works projects acceptable to tax-averse polities  and return-hungry investors, that nothing as prosaic as mere ugliness could  stop them.  Have we yet seen a nuclear power plant designed with an eye                                                                                                                 42. Id. at 257.   43.

It is no coincidence that the Tappan Zee Bridge, whose designers bragged  about their indifference to the aesthetic appeal of the work, arose during the same era as the Cross Bronx  Expressway.  As Robert Caro’s biography of Moses meticulously documents, notions of engineering  efficiency seemed during this era to trump any concern for effects that are experienced at the scale of  individual people.

Regrettably, such indifference to the way in which people are affected  by the engineered objects in their midst has not merely engendered  obliviousness as everyday people look inward for signs of beauty.  Public  thinkers have responded by promoting hostility to the efforts of those who  would demand a higher standard for our infrastructure.  For example, the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan laudably complained in  1969 of   a steady deterioration in the quality of public buildings and  spaces, and with it a decline in the symbols of public unity  and common purpose with which the citizen can identify,  of which he can be proud, and by which he can know what  he shares with his fellow citizens.49  In a book published two years later, After the Planners, architect and urban  planner Robert Goodman juxtaposed Moynihan’s comments with a  complaint by Adolph Hitler that “our cities of the present lack the symbol  of national community which, we must therefore not be surprised to find,  sees no symbol of itself in the cities.”50  Goodman fancied himself a “guerrilla architect,” as he embodied the  counter-cultural zeitgeist of his era.51  But if his juxtapositions were  amusingly subtle, ultimately this contempt for the prevailing design  imperatives of his day found their way into popular culture, delivered in  one memorable instance by a blunt instrument indeed: the pen of popular                                                                                                                 48.

Staff writer David Owen of The New Yorker magazine went from being  an obscure golf writer to semi-famous environmental provocateur in 2004  when he published an article proclaiming Manhattan a “utopian  community” that is, “in comparison with the rest of America . . . a model of  environmental responsibility.”55 He declared that New York City was “the  greenest community in the United States.”56  To make his point, Owen compared his current existence, in an  eighteenth century farmhouse on a dirt road in rural Connecticut, to his  former, automobile-free life in a 700-square-foot Manhattan apartment.57   Calling the move an “ecological catastrophe,” Owen pointed out that “if  you made all eight million New Yorkers live at the density of my town,  they would require a space equivalent to the land area of the six New  England states plus Delaware and New Jersey.”58  The author’s plausible  contention is that those eight million people, so arrayed, would increase  their use of energy by an order of magnitude.59  Thus, Owen reasoned,  “[t]he environmental challenge we face, at the current stage of our assault  on the world’s non-renewable resources, is not how to make our teeming  cities more like the pristine countryside.  The true challenge is how to make  other settled places more like Manhattan.”60                                                                                                                 52.

And it means infrastructure that is attentive  to the concerns Senator Moynihan expressed in 1969.61  It cannot be a  coincidence that the nation’s largest producer of electric power, more than  sixty years after its creation in the crucible of the New Deal, is the  Tennessee Valley Authority.62  This massive public works initiative was so  noteworthy as a design that New York’s Museum of Modern Art held an  exhibition on the TVA in 1941, prompting historian and cultural critic  Lewis Mumford to praise the TVA’s designs in The New Yorker magazine  as “breathtaking . . . as close to perfection as our age has come.”63  Perhaps the most crucial thing that the designers of our infrastructure  can do is to suffuse their projects with honesty, eschewing artifice.  New  York’s grand suspension bridge, the George Washington, is especially  beloved because the planned masonry cladding for the bridge’s two massive  towers was never built, leaving satisfyingly visible evidence of the  powerful structure that holds up the giant Hudson River crossing.64  In  Columbus, Indiana, a haven of architectural excellence, architect Myron  Goldsmith took the bold step of creating an industrial building with one  entire façade of glass, the better to show off the newspaper printing presses  within.65  Similarly, the muscular concrete dams of the TVA require little  explanation to those curious about how so much energy is produced.  In his lucidly persuasive disquisition on the connection between  architecture and human happiness, the writer Alain de Botton describes a  train trip that took him across the Salginatobel Bridge, near Schiers in  Switzerland.66  Now nearly 70-years old, the 269-foot span across an alpine  chasm has become an icon of reinforced concrete as used in an arch  bridge,67 so nimbly does it make its leap.68  According to de Botton, the  Salginatobel Bridge    testifies to how closely a certain kind of beauty is bound up  with our admiration for man-made objects which can                                                                                                                 61.

We see beauty in thick slate roofs that challenge  hailstones to do their worst, in sea defences that shrug off  the waves which batter them, and in bolts, rivets, cables,  beams and buttresses.  We feel moved by edifices— cathedrals, skyscrapers, hangars, tunnels, pylons—which  compensate for our inadequacies, our inability to cross  mountains or carry cables between cities.  We respond with  emotion to creations which transport us across distances we  could never walk, which shelter us during storms we could  not weather, which pick up signals we could never hear  with our own ears and which hang daintily off cliffs from  which we would fall instantly to our deaths.69  Are we losing the capacity for this kind of admiration?  De Botton is a vigilant observer of things; he marvels at how his train,  crossing the bridge, “makes its way over the gap, and through a small  cloud, with the brisk formality one might associate with the most routine of  activities.”70  He pronounces the span the very embodiment of elegance,  which he defines as “a subcategory of beauty” in which a work of  architecture “succeeds in carrying out an act of resistance—holding,  spanning, sheltering—with grace and economy as well as strength; when it  has the modesty not to draw attention to the difficulties it has  surmounted.”71  It is reasonable to assume that, in the England and Scotland  of the early twentieth century, people gazed at lighthouses and properly  understood them as their own acts of resistance against what was then the  very real possibility of perilous navigational error.  To the Lighthouse, after  all, followed the sinking of the Titanic by only fifteen years.72  Today we perceive lighthouses as quaint, much as we regard windmills,  silos, steam locomotives, and old-fashioned ballparks.  But wind turbines,  arguably as elegant as the Salginatobel Bridge, so lightly do they carry their  burden of generating electricity from natural forces at megawatt scale, are  derided as unwelcome changes to the natural landscape when they threaten  to alter the view of Nantucket Sound, enjoyed by the descendants of Joseph                                                                                                                 69.
