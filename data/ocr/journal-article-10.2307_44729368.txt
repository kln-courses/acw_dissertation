Timothy Walilko, John Cavanaugh, and Albert King Wayne State Univ. Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Side impact pendulum tests were conducted on Eurosid I and Biosid to assess the biofidelity of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis, and determine injury tolerance levels. Each body region was impacted at 4.5, 6.7, and 9.4 m/s using test conditions which duplicate cadaver impacts with a 15 cm flat-circular 23.4 kg rigid mass. The cadaver database establishes human response and injury risk assessment in side impact. Both dummies showed better biofidelity when compared to the lowest-speed cadaver response corridor. At higher speeds, peak force was substantially higher. The average peak contact force was 1.56 times greater in Biosid and 2.19 times greater in Eurosid I than the average cadaver response. The Eurosid I abdomen had the most dissimilar response and lacks biofidelity. Overall, Biosid has better biofidelity than Eurosid I with an average 21% lower peak load and a closer match to the duration of cadaver impact responses for the three body regions. There was a significant correlation between cadaver and dummy responses in similar tests; so, within the limitations discussed, injury risk can be assessed in the dummies. Eurosid I chest deflection was not sufficient to prevent bottoming in high-speed tests. However, peak VC occurs before rib bottoming and enables chest injury assessment for all of the pendulum impacts. Based on a 50% risk of AIS 3+ chest injury in a 45 year old cadaver, Eurosid I tolerances are D = 52 mm and VC = 1.17 m/s. For pelvic fracture, the tolerances are FpUbic = 7.1 kN and Gs3-y = 100 g. Based on a 25% risk of AIS 4+ chest injury, Biosid tolerances are D = 64 mm and VC = 1.37 m/s. For pelvic fracture, Fpubic = 3.6 kN and Gs3-Y = 100 g. The research establishes a technical basis for injury tolerance levels in Eurosid I and Biosid. INTRODUCTION Side impact dummies are regularly used to assess occupant safety in side impacts, but tolerance levels are not precisely determined in some cases. Currently, three side impact dummies are available: SID, Eurosid I and Biosid. SID was developed in 1979- 82 by the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) of the University of Michigan under a contract with NHTSA. The production prototype Eurosid was developed by a group of European research laboratories working together under the auspices of the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) during 1983-85. In order to develop a full-scale side-impact test procedure, the International Standard Organization (ISO) established a set of impact response requirements for head, neck, chest, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis to establish the biofidelity of a side-impact dummy. Both SID and Eurosid were evaluated using these requirements by worldwide groups, including Irwin et al (1989), Bendjellal et al (1988) and Janssen et al (1988). The conclusion was that neither dummy had sufficient biofidelity to be used in the ISO full-scale side-impact test procedure. Eurosid was further developed by EEVC to the current production type Eurosid I. In the United States, the SAE Side Impact Dummy Task Force was formed and finalized the development of Biosid. The chest, abdomen and shoulder were originally developed by General Motors, and a prototype Biosid showed promise of better biofidelity than other side impact dummies available at the time. The biofidelity of Eurosid I and Biosid has been evaluated against the ISO requirements and showed better performance than their predecessors although neither dummy completely satisfies the ISO requirements (Bendjellal et al 1991, Kallieris et al 1992, Harigae et al 1991, Kanianthra et al 1991, Roberts et al 1991). 3169</page><page sequence="2">In addition to biofidelity, injury risk assessment of the dummies is an important aspect in determining occupant protection. The preferred approach for injury risk assessment involves interpreting dummy responses using an injury risk function which is based on Logist probability analysis of human biomechanics and injury. Since live human subjects cannot be subjected to crashes which may produce injuries, human injury is estimated either from real world accident investigation or from laboratory tests of human cadavers. Then, by reconstructing the accidents in which injuries are known or by conducting laboratory tests following the same conditions of the human cadaver tests, the injury received by the human subjects can be correlated with the response measured on the dummy. A series of lateral pendulum-impact tests were conducted on human cadavers (Viano et al 1989, Viano 1989) to determine human biomechanical responses and injuries for the chest, abdomen and pelvis. The studies provide a database of human injuries, tolerance levels and biomechanical response corridors. By conducting lateral impact pendulum tests on Eurosid I and Biosid following the same conditions as the cadaver tests, the aims of the present study are: 1. To study the biofidelity of Eurosid I and Biosid by comparing the dummy responses with human response corridors established in Viano (1989). 2. To establish a technical basis for injury risk functions and tolerance levels in Eurosid I and Biosid dummy by correlating dummy responses with human cadaver responses. METHODOLOGY Dummy Tests: The Eurosid I dummy was supplied by Ford Motor Company and calibrated according to established TNO procedures prior to the testing. The Eurosid I tests were sponsored by ACEA, a European Association of Automotive Manufacturers. The Biosid dummy was supplied by General Motors and calibrated prior to the testing. The Biosid tests were sponsored by General Motors. Instrumentation: A uniaxial load cell and accelerometer were attached to the impactor to measure impact force and calculate impactor velocity. The dummies were instrumented in standard configuration, this included for Eurosid I: deflection of the three ribs, rib acceleration on the impacted side, spinal and pelvic acceleration, and pubic and abdominal force. For Biosid, the instrumentation included: deflection of the five ribs, acceleration at each rib on the impacted side, spinal and pelvic acceleration, and pubic, iliac and sacrum force. The Impact: The experimental set-up for the Eurosid I and Biosid duplicated an earlier series of cadaver tests (Viano et al 1989). These tests were conducted at Wayne State University using the same impact facility as the earlier series. All aspects of the tests were similar, except the cadaver tests were in a slightly oblique lateral direction for thoracic and abdominal impacts to prevent the rotation about the spine. Ail of the dummy tests were at 90° pure lateral. The dummy was seated upright with the arms removed and was impacted by a power-assisted rigid pendulum (Figure 1). The thorax, abdomen and pelvis were impacted separately with a 23.4 kg pendulum freely suspended by guide wires and accelerated to impact speeds of approximately 4.5, 6.7 and 9.4 m/s. A pneumatically charged cylinder was used to accelerate the mass in 5 cm travel of a thrust piston. The impact methodology is described in Viano et al (1989). The pendulum interface was a smooth flat, 15 cm diameter disc with the edges rounded. The configuration allowed simultaneous contact of the three thoracic ribs of both dummies for the lateral chest impacts. Contact of the Eurosid I abdomen was below the third thoracic rib. For Biosid, the third chest rib and two abdominal ribs were contacted for the abdomen tests. Abdomen tests involved loading above the metal skeleton of the pelvis. Pelvic loading was centered on the H-point. For each body region, two tests were performed at the same impact speed. Figure 1 . Experimental set-up with a pneumatic power- assisted pendulum and upright seated dummy. Tests were conducted without the arm or jacket on the dummy (adapted from Viano et al 1989). Data processing: Rib deflection was determined by conventional linear displacement transducers in Eurosid I and string-potentiometers in Biosid. It was filtered with Butterworth channel class 60. Rib, spinal and pelvic acceleration were filtered with a finite impulse response (FIR) filter having a band pass frequency of 100 Hz. Impactor, abdominal and pubic force were filtered with Butterworth channel class 180. The response of the impactor accelerometer was multiplied by a mass correction factor to eliminate the inertial effect of the mass in front of the load cell. Impact force was obtained by subtracting the inertial force from the load cell force. 3170</page><page sequence="3">A Wayne State University (WSU) computer program was used to determine the viscous response VC of the chest and abdomen. Rib deflection D(t) was filtered and differentiated to give rib deformation velocity V(t): V(t) = d D(t) / dt Velocity V(t) and deflection D(t) were multiplied and divided by a scale factor Do to obtain rib VC(t): VC(t) = V(t) D(t) / D0 The WSU VC program has the option of whether to further filter rib velocity V(t) after the differentiation of D(t) or not. For Eurosid I, D(t) was filtered with Butterworth channel class 180, V(t) was not filtered, and the internal dimension of 140 mm for the half thorax width was used as the normalization factor Do- The WSU procedure provides results that are consistent with the EEVC method for computing VC. For Biosid, D(t) and V(t) were filtered with Butterworth channel class 60 and a 175 mm half thorax width dimension was used as the normalization factor D0. Statistical Methods: In the cadaver lateral impact study (Viano et al 1989), injury risk functions were determined using the Logist function in the Statistical Analysis Package (SAS). This function relates the probability of injury occurrence p(x) to a response parameter x based on a statistical fit to a sigmoidal function: p(x) = [1 + exp(a - ßx)]"1 The goodness-of-fit of the statistic is quantified by the chi-squared (x2), p-value (p) and correlation coefficient (R). By conducting identical tests on Eurosid I and Biosid at the same impact severity levels as the cadaver tests, a linear relationship was established between the average cadaver response (xcadaver) and dummy response (xqummy): xcadaver = a + bxdummy where a and b were determined by linear regression of the average cadaver and dummy peak responses at the three impact severity levels. Then, a dummy response can be plotted into the risk function for purposes of injury assessment and establishing tolerance levels. RESULTS Based on the original cadaver lateral impact data, biomechanical responses from the individual tests were scaled by Viano (1989) to the 50th percentile adult male using the procedure of Mertz (1984). The scaled force-deflection and force-time data for the nine test conditions (three impact severity levels for each body region) were used to determine corridors within which the human response data fell. The biofidelity of Eurosid I and Biosid were evaluated relative to these corridors. The human biomechanical responses, injuries and Logist-function analysis are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 from Viano et al (1989) . Based on the Logist analysis, human tolerance levels were determined for a 25% risk of AIS 4+ injury for the chest and abdomen. This level of injury severity and probability is consistent with previous studies to establish human tolerances from human cadaver and animal impacts. The level is an appropriate trade-off for balanced protection of the population at risk and represents a risk similar to that found in current crash protection standards. For pelvic impacts, the tolerance was set for a 25% probability of pubic ramus fracture. The published tolerance levels for the thorax, abdomen and pelvis are reprinted in Table 3. The data will be used to establish injury risk levels for Eurosid I and Biosid. In addition, the cadaver chest injuries were adjusted to a standardized age of 45 years as recommended by ACEA, using a method by Marcus et al (1983). First, the number of fractured ribs NFR was adjusted to the age 45 with a scale factor of 0.2 NFR/year, that is: NFRadj = NFRorg + 0.2(AGEcad - 45) Then, a new SAIS was calculated by the following: SAIS 2 = NFRadj 1 ~ 3 SAIS 3 = NFRadj 4-8 SAIS 4 = NFRadj &gt; 9 Finally, MAIS was determined from the larger of SAIS and internal AIS. The internal AIS was not adjusted by age since there are no procedures to adjust internal AIS levels by age. The age adjusted injury data was re-analyzed by Logist analysis to determine the probability of AIS 3+ injury for a 45 year old. Tolerance levels were set at a 50% probability of AIS 3+. The results are shown in Table 4. The age adjusted tolerance levels for chest VC and deflection in Eurosid I and Biosid are based on these data. Eurosid I and Biosid Thoracic impact Biofidelity of Eurosid I: Force for the three impact velocities is shown in Figure 2, and compared with response corridors from lateral impact cadaver tests (Viano 1989). At 4.4 m/s, the slope of the loading phrase was higher than the corridor, consequently, the peak impact force occurred earlier and outside the upper boundary. The time duration was slightly shorter. At 6.5 and 9.3 m/s, the slope of both loading and unloading phrases were much higher than the corridors and resulted in much higher impact force and shorter duration. The responses passed through the cadaver corridor but were largely outside of the human response. 3171</page><page sequence="4">Table 1.

The dummy and cadaver showed a viscoelastic response. Peak force increased with impact speed, but Eurosid I developed significantly higher force at 9.3 m/s. There was clear evidence that the Eurosid I ribs bottomed out in the 6.5 and 9.3 m/s tests. However, the rib deflection curves could be extrapolated when bottoming out occurred by using a smooth curve fit between the pre and post bottoming deflection. The peak average extrapolated deflection was 53 mm in 6.5 m/s tests, only 2 mm higher than the bottomed rib deflection level. This means the ribs almost reached maximum deflection when bottoming occurred. In 9.3 m/s tests, the average extrapolated peak deflection was 61 mm, about 10 mm higher than the bottomed deflection. This means much more deflection would be expected without rib bottoming; therefore, there was a significant increase in impact force and upper spine acceleration. In spite of the rib bottoming effects, it was possible to obtain valid VC peaks since they occurred before rib bottoming. This phenomenon allows Eurosid I to be used in higher speed side impacts than might be appropriate based on limited chest deflection. However, the biofidelity in response is compromised when the ribs bottom and therefore the dummy kinematics and responses of other body regions could be affected. Based on the average dummy and cadaver responses for the three impact severities, a linear relation was determined between Eurosid I responses and comparable cadaver responses. The correlation function was obtained through linear regression. Considering the rib bottoming effects at higher velocities, the correlation function for rib deflection was based on the three impact severities and the extrapolated deflections at the two higher pendulum velocities. Correlation functions for various response parameters are given in Table 6. By substituting the correlation functions from Table 6 into the injury risk functions in Tables 2 and 4, comparable risk functions and tolerance levels can be determined for Eurosid I. Figure 3 shows the data points for the correlation, the linear regression line, and the corresponding tolerances for cadavers and Eurosid I. For the original cadaver risk functions (non age-adjusted), a risk level of 25% probability of AIS 4+ injury was used to establish the tolerance for Eurosid I. The levels for a 5% risk are VC = 1.12 m/s and D = 5.28 cm. For the age adjusted to a 45 years old cadaver, a risk level of 50% probability of AIS 3+ injury was used to establish the tolerance for Eurosid I. Tolerance levels are summarized in Table 7. For comparison, the proposed injury assessment reference values from Mertz (1993) are VC = 1.00 m/s and D = 4.20 cm. Biofidelity of Biosid: Force for the three impact velocities are shown in Figure 4, compared with the response corridors from Viano (1989). At 4.4 m/s, peak force exceeded the upper limit of the corridors and the time duration was shorter due to the slope of the unloading phrase. At 6.5 m/s, the peak force was higher than the upper boundary, but the overall shape of the response was in good agreement with the corridors. At 9.3 m/s, the Biosid ribs bottomed out and the peak impact force was much higher than the boundary, but the time duration was within the corridors. Injury Risk Functions and Tolerance of Biosid: Table 8 summarizes the average peak Biosid and cadaver responses for the three impact severities. Biosid responses were related to cadaver responses through linear regression. Correlation functions for various response parameters are given in Table 9. Substituting the correlation functions into the injury risk functions in Table 2 and 4, risk functions and tolerance levels were determined for Biosid. Figure 5 shows the linear regression functions and the corresponding tolerance levels for the cadaver and Biosid. The injury risk levels used to establish Biosid tolerances were the same as that for Eurosid I. The Biosid tolerances are given in Table 10. The 5% AIS 4+ risk levels are VC = 0.96 m/s and D = 5.88 cm. For comparison, the Injury assessment reference values from Mertz (1993) are VC = 1.00 m/s and D = 4.20 cm. Comparison between Eurosid I and Biosid Thorax Responses: According to impact force-time responses, the thorax of both dummies showed better biofidelity at the lowest pendulum speed, but did not completely satisfy the response corridors from the cadaver tests. Overall, the Biosid demonstrated better biofidelity than Eurosid I. The time duration of Biosid responses were generally in good agreement with the cadaver response corridors, although the impact force exceeded the upper bound. The Eurosid I force-time responses essentially fell outside the corridors at the two higher impact speed. One possible reason is the limited rib deflection range, the ribs bottomed out at the higher impact speeds. Bottoming resulted in a sudden increase in impact force which altered the force-time response. In terms of Injury risk assessment, both dummies showed limitations in reflecting human thoracic biomechanical responses. However, the correlation between cadaver and dummy responses showed a high degree of significance for all of the response parameters. The Eurosid I chest VC gave the best equivalence with the cadaver responses, since the linear regression coefficients were close to unity.

Correlation between Biosid and Cadaver Average Responses for Lateral Thoracic Impacts. 3178</page><page sequence="11">Eurosid I has a very stiff response behavior at all three speeds. The peak forces were considerably high than the cadaver response corridors, while the time duration was too short. None of the responses fell within the corridors. Injury Risk Functions and Tolerance of Eurosid I: The average peak Eurosid I and cadaver responses are summarized in Table 1 1 for the three test speeds. The Eurosid I internal load is the sum of the three measured forces. The comparable cadaver injuries were typically of moderate severity, even for the highest impact speed. Since there is no measurement of abdominal deflection in the Eurosid I, the total internal abdominal load Fjn{ema| was correlated with the cadaver abdominal VC and deflection for injury risk assessment. The correlation functions are given in Table 12. Substituting the correlation function into the cadaver risk function from Table 2, risk functions and tolerance levels were determined for the abdomen of Eurosid I. Figure 7 shows the linear regression and corresponding tolerance levels for the cadaver and Eurosid I. Risk levels for 50% probability of AIS 3+ injury and 25% probability of AIS 4+ injury were used to establish tolerance levels for the Eurosid I abdomen. Tolerance levels are summarized in Table 13. For a 5% risk of AIS 4+ injury, F¡nterna| = 6.45 kN. This is based on the correlation with the cadaver viscous response. The injury assessment reference value from Mertz (1993) is F¡nterna| = 4.50 kN. The recommended tolerance levels for Eurosid I are F¡nterr d| = 9.39 kN for 50% probability of AIS 3+ injury and F¡nternal = 9-21 kN for 25% probability of AIS 4+ injury based on the cadaver viscous response. These values are essentially similar due to the minimal occurrence of AIS 3+ injury in the abdominal impacts of cadavers. The tolerance levels are significantly higher than the current reference values, and are influenced, in part, by the lack of biofidelity. Biofidelity of Biosid: Figure 8 shows the impact force and cadaver impact corridors at three severities. The peak impact force was higher than the upper boundary for all impact speeds, but the time duration matched the corridors especially for the highest speed test. None of the responses fell completely inside the corridors. Injury Risk Functions and Tolerance of Biosid: The average peak Biosid response and comparable cadaver responses are summarized in Table 14 for the three test speeds. Biosid responses were related to comparable cadaver responses. Correlation functions for various response parameters are given in Table 15. Following the same procedure as for Eurosid I, injury risk and tolerance levels were determined for Biosid and the results are presented in Figure 9 and Table 16. For a 5% risk of AIS 4+ injury, VC = 1 .20 m/s and D = 5.64 cm. The injury assessment reference value from Mertz (1993) is D = 3.9 cm. Comparison between Eurosid I and Biosid Abdomen Responses: Based on impact force, the abdomen of the Biosid dummy showed better biofidelity than Eurosid I at all three impact severities. Although the peak impact force of Biosid was above the upper boundary of the corridors, the overall shape and time duration matched the corridors quite well, especially at 9.4 m/s. Eurosid I responses were very stiff with a considerably higher peak force and shorter time duration, even at the lowest speed. In terms of relating dummy responses with human responses and injury, neither dummy fully simulated human abdomen biomechanics. The Eurosid I internal abdominal load response was related to cadaver VC and deflection. The correlation between Eurosid I and cadaver impact force response was good although it was not significant for lower spine acceleration. For Biosid, the VC and impact force significantly correlated with cadaver responses; however, the correlation with deflection and lower spine acceleration were not significant because of the minimal occurrence of AIS 3+ injury in the cadaver abdominal impact tests. The tolerance for 50% probability of AIS 3+ injury for some of the parameters is higher than that for 25% probability of AIS 4+ injury, although the tolerance levels are similar. The tolerance levels determined in this study of Eurosid I and Biosid are higher than the current criterion. The higher tolerance level may be related to the larger diameter impact face as compared to the armrest loading used in earlier studies. The new biomechanical data indicate that human tolerance may be higher to abdominal loads that are well distributed over the abdomen as compared with a small area of contact. Eurosid I and Biosid Pelvic Impact Biofidelity of Eurosid I: Response corridors for the medium impact severity were not established since there were insufficient cadaver pelvic responses at this level. Thus, the dummy responses were compared only to the lowest and highest speed corridors. Figure 10 shows the impact force and the cadaver corridors. At 4.8 m/s, Eurosid I showed good biofidelity and the response was inside the corridor. At 9.8 m/s, the response was too stiff with the peak force exceeding the upper boundary of the corridor. Injury Assessment and Tolerance of Eurosid I: The average peak Eurosid I and comparable cadaver responses are given in Table 17. Cadaver pelvic impacts did not result in injuries in the two lower test speeds, and only a few cases of pelvic fracture in the highest speed test. The pelvic tolerance for Eurosid I was not based on a probability function because of the minimal incidence of cadaver injury. Thus, a conservative level is proposed in Table 18 for 25% probability of pelvic fracture in the cadaver. For 3179</page><page sequence="12">Table 11.

Biofidelity of Biosid: Figure 11 shows the Biosid impact force and the cadaver corridors at the low and high speeds. Biosid showed good biofidelity at both speeds. At 4.8 m/s, the response was within the corridor for both peak force and time duration. At 9.8 m/s, the overall shape was in good agreement with the corridor, but the peak force exceeded the upper boundary. Injury Assessment and Tolerance of Biosid: Average peak Biosid and comparable cadaver responses are given in Table 19. Similar to Eurosid I, the injury assessment and tolerance of Biosid is conservative using the highest impact severity in Table 20. The injury assessment reference values from Mertz (1993) are FpUb¡c = 10 kN and Gg3-Y = 130 g. Comparison between Eurosid I and Biosid Pelvic Responses: Based on impact force, the pelvis of both dummies showed good agreement with the corridors at the lowest impact speed. At the highest speed, the response of Eurosid I was too stiff while Biosid demonstrated better biofidelity. SUMMARY 'A series of side-impact pendulum tests was conducted at Wayne State University on Eurosid I and Biosid. The experiments utilized test conditions from an extensive series of lateral cadaver impacts (Viano et al 1989). The thorax, abdomen and pelvis were tested at three different impact speeds of approximately 4.5, 6.7, and 9.4 m/s with a 15 cm flat rigid circular interface on a 23.4 kg pendulum. The Eurosid I tests were sponsored by ACEA, and the Biosid tests were sponsored by General Motors. The biofidelity of each dummy thorax, abdomen and pelvis was compared with the cadaver response corridors from the original tests. Both dummies showed better biofidelity in lower speed impacts than at higher speeds. Overall, Biosid has better biofidelity than Eurosid I for all three body regions. The cadaver corridors bound the measured responses in lateral impact. No adjustments were made for muscle tension, as side impacts often occur with little warning to occupants of the struck vehicle. The Eurosid I and Biosid responses were correlated to the cadaver data on the thorax, abdomen and pelvis to establish injury tolerance levels. Based on European recommendations for injury risk of 50% probability of AIS 3+ torso injury in a 45 year old and 25% probability of pelvic fracture, the proposed Eurosid I tolerance levels are: Eurosid I Thorax D = 52 mm VC = 1.17 m/s Abdomen Fjptemal = 9.2 kN Pelvis Fpubic = 7.1 kN Gs3-Y= 100 g Based on a 25% probability of AIS 4+ thoracic and abdominal injury and 25% probability of pelvic fracture, the proposed Biosid tolerance levels are: Biosid Thorax D = 64 mm VC = 1.37 m/s Abdomen D = 74 mm VC = 1.81 m/s Pelvis Fpubic = 3.6 kN GS3-Y= 100 g A significant correlation was found between the cadaver and dummies for most biomechanical responses, so injury tolerances can be assessed with a high degree of confidence. Both dummies produce higher impact force than human cadavers, particularly at higher impact speeds. Table 21 summarizes the differences in average peak force. Peak force was 56% greater in Biosid and 119% greater in Eurosid I than the average developed by cadavers when all body regions and impact severities are considered. Figure 12 compares the peak value of dummy load with the average and corridor response for the cadavers. The Eurosid I abdomen had the most dissimilar response and lacks biofidelity. Overall, Biosid has better biofidelity than Eurosid I with 21% lower peak loads and a closer match with the duration of cadaver impact responses. The rib deflection range of Eurosid I is not sufficient to prevent bottoming and a sharp increase in chest load for impacts at 6.5 m/s and higher speed. However, peak VC occurred before rib bottoming and enabled chest injury assessment for all impact severities. This work establishes a technical basis for injury tolerance levels in Eurosid I and Biosid.
