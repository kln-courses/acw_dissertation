<plain_text><page sequence="1">BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER: THE MANY AND THE ONE IN INUIT RELIGION by Daniel Merkur HE PAN-INUIT WORD sila, together with its dialectic variants hila, hla, shla, sla, tla, etc., has an extensive range of meanings: "the world, the universe; nature, the natural order; common sense, reason; consciousness; the air, the wind(s), the weather; the place or space outside, the open sky." Petersen (1966-67:262) remarks that "even though the individual meanings must not be mixed together in daily talk, the concept 'sila' naturally covers them all." Unity is provided to the idea sila by the unity of the conception of the numen known, sometimes as Sila, but sometimes as Silap inua, "the owner of sila." Scholarly efforts to understand the Inuit conception of Sila have varied. Thalbitzer (1926:375) was content to characterize Sila as "the spirit of the air, the master of the weather," as was Rasmtissen throughout his writings. Both agreed that the conception had regional variations. Both held that "the main godheads of the Inuit are nearly everywhere three in number... [and] quite independent of each other" (Thalbitzer 1926:375). Birket-Smith (1924:433) instead entertained an animatistic notion of a "mystic, supernatural power which per- meates all existence." Weyer (1932:389) argued that "the spirit is not simply an essence or an abstract power, but the personification of these characters." In connection with his theory of primal monotheism, Schmidt (1931:269) identified Sila as a Supreme Being; and, on em- pirical grounds, Pettazzoni (1956:354-61) and Hultkrantz (1965:358) agree. More recently, Williamson has furnished what I regard as the key to the understanding of Sila, in an ethnological account of Keewatin District. Sila is the life-giving element, which enfolds all the world and invests all living organisms, and without which there can be no life. Sila is the word for air, without air there is no life; air is in all people and all creatures; anything deprived of air ceases to live. In that air therefore gives life and without air there is no life, the Eskimos believed that they are part of the Life-Giving Spirit, that each individual is animated by the Life-Giving Spirit, and that the part of his soul, that part which is 23</page><page sequence="2">24 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 the essence of all things living, is part of the ultimate deity Sila (Williamson 1974:22). Williamson's ethnology is from a culture undergoing change. Mis- sionaries have been active in Keewatin since Turquetil arrived in 1912. As a result, the Iglulik today speak of a single soul that has several component parts (Williamson 1974:23). However, Hultkrantz has demonstrated the existence of a traditional, pan-Inuit belief, albeit with regional variations, in soul dualism. Inuit names for the two souls vary, but the majority of references are to breath and shadow. The breath imparts life and warmth to the body. It also imparts consciousness, will, and reason. Breath is, of course, airy and, except in winter, invisible. Breath is nonetheless said to have "appearance as a human being," regardless of species (Rasmussen 1929:58). Because the Inuit language has few nouns by which to express phenomena that cannot be perceived by the senses, the expression may be taken figuratively, as a reference to anthropopsychic powers rather than anthropomorphic shape. Hultkrantz (1953:497-510) and Paulson (1964) have postulated a relationship between the free-soul (Inuit shadow) and the animal owner. My present concern instead pertains to the neglected topic of the type of deity that corresponds to the breath-soul. The attributes of the breath-soul in man are, I suggest, those possessed on a cosmic scale by Sila. Sila is at once the cosmic body, "the world, the universe," and its vivifying breath, "the air, the wind(s), the weather." As the cosmic breath-soul, Sila encompasses "consciousness," inclusive of "common sense, reason," which latter manifests dynamically as "na- ture, the natural order." The Iglulik description of the breath-soul, inusia, as "one with the spirit of life" (Rasmussen 1929:23) renders explicit the idea of the participation of the Many in the One that is, with few exceptions, otherwise only implicit in the pan-Inuit idea of Sila. Inuit traditional religion is today extinct, obsolescent, and per- sisting, depending on which Inuit band is under discussion. Despite the uneven quality of the ethnological data, regional variations in the idea of Sila are sufficiently many to indicate patterns of historical development. Sila in Religious Belief As defined by Arbman (1939:26), religious belief is based on the experience of a numen as a living power responsible for what is ex- perienced as a miraculous physical event. Religious beliefs do not include verbal statements that present mythic conceptions in brief</page><page sequence="3">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 25 form. For present purposes, religious beliefs will be treated together with two genres of oral narrative: the memorate, a first-person report of a religious experience; and the belief legend, a third-person account of a religious experience that, in passing into legend, has undergone schematizing simplification and/or acquired new motifs (Honko 1964:12). The Chugach, the southernmost Inuit in Alaska, believe in tlam- shua, "the owner of tla." Tla signifies the universe, the weather, the air, and an omnipresent power in the world. Tlam-shua is also termed pikna, "the one above." Prayers to him, on behalf of the sick, are addressed to the sky. He also controls the weather (Birket-Smith 1953:120-21). The Koniag, of Kodiak Island, regard Hlam shua, "the World Owner," as the highest being. He created the sky and the earth, rules the air and the light, and has the power to create earthquakes (Weyer 1932:390, Lantis 1938:139, Hultkrantz 1965:358). In the Bering Sea region and northern Alaska, belief in Sila is sparse. Raven is often credited with the origin of the universe and the creation of thunder, rain, and storm (Hultkrantz 1965:358). Im- portant evidence is obtained, however, from the periphery of the-area. A shaman from Nunivak Island, whom Rasmussen met in Seward Peninsula, described his belief in Lam-coax, the World Owner. Lantis (1946:197) confirms that these beliefs are general on Nunivak. Sila ... is not to be explained in simple words. A great spirit, supporting the world and the weather and all life on earth, a spirit so mighty that his utterance to mankind is not through common words, but by storm and snow and rain and the fury of the sea; all the forces of nature that men fear. But he has also another way of utterance, by sunlight, and calm of the sea, and little children innocently at play, themselves understanding nothing. Children hear a soft and gentle voice, almost like that of a woman. It comes to them in a mysterious way, but so gently that they are not afraid; they only hear that some danger threatens. And the children mention it as it were casually when they come home, and it is then the business of the angakoq [: shaman] to take such measures as shall guard against the peril. When all is well, Sila sends no message to mankind, but withdraws into his own endless nothingness, apart. So he remains as long as men do not abuse life, but act with reverence towards their daily food. No one has seen Sila; his place of being is a mystery, in that he is at once among us and unspeakably far away (Rasmussen 1927:385-6). With the exception of the Caribou group, the Inuit employ masculine pronouns for Sila and conceive of him in myth as a male. The Nunivak shamans' observation that children hear a voice "almost like that of</page><page sequence="4">26 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 a woman" is an index of the irrelevance of gender-determining an- thropomorphisms in most experiences of religious belief. The Diomede Islanders claimed to invoke Sila before setting out on raiding expeditions in pre-contact times. Sila had also at least some role in punishing taboo violations (Weyer 1932:390-1). The Asiatic Inuit presently describe Silam jugwa, the World Owner, as the creator of the universe and of all living creatures. His traditional epithet is instead kijagnyk, "who gives life." He requires all of the traditional observances. Belief legends describe him as coming down to earth to carry off taboo-violators to his celestial home, in order to teach them taboo observance (Menovscikov 1968:446-8). A native of Point Hope, in northern Alaska, described "the Great Universe Owner" as constantly watching mankind. The traditional observances are required by him. "Only by following those rules, you will be assisted by that Power when you are in time of need." Prayer to him is conducted as a mental request. Among other matters, he is beseeched for good weather (Rasmussen 1952:271-2). The Copper conceive of hila as the lower regions of the sky, and Hilap inua as the Air Owner. He is responsible for the good weather that makes life possible. An epithet is qakimna, "the one up there." Some Copper subgroups attribute the traditional observances to him. The Air Owner himself punishes some taboo violations by means of the winds, blizzards, etc. The Sea-woman punishes the remainder, e.g., by hiding the game animals. She does so out of fear of the Air Owner, should she fail to do so (Rasmussen 1932:22-3, 31, 36). A belief legend describes two famished hunters sharing an inadequate meal." Then suddenly they heard a voice outside cry: That poor meat! It was the spirit of the air, who merely wished to let them know that it was over them and closely watching what they did, for such is the spirit of the air; it is over one when one least expects it (Rasmussen 1932:193). Jenness describes a Copper practice of magic that again presup- poses the idea of a cosmic breath-soul. Most interesting is their peculiar belief in the projection of human will.... During a storm the natives often cry out, "Be fine, it is very unpleasant when the weather is bad, be fine;" or again, "We can't seal when the weather is stormy, be fine! ... It was not the spirit world that the[y] ... had in mind when they made these appeals, for once when I added, "Hearken and obey," they all burst out laughing; rather they seemed to hold that the very expression of one's thought, the mere utterance of a wish, in some dim and obscure manner worked for its fulfilment (Jenness 1922:229).</page><page sequence="5">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 27 The Air Owner is not a helping spirit to be commanded or coerced. He has an independent dignity and will. Man's own will is nonetheless efficacious because will, a function of the breath-soul, participates within that cosmic will which is Hila. A Netsilik informant told Rasmussen (1931:104), "Hila is a spirit out in the heavens. Or perhaps it is nothing else than the sudden storm, rain, drifting snow, snow-storm-everything that may be dan- gerous if we are caught in it. How should we know?" A Netsilik poet explained the relationships of song, breath, and thought. There are so many occasions in one's life when a joy or a sorrow is felt in such a way that the desire comes to sing.... All my being is song, and I sing as I draw breath. ... Songs are thoughts, sung out with the breath when people are moved by great forces and ordinary speech no longer suffices. Man is moved just like the ice floe sailing here and there out in the current. His thoughts are driven by a flowing force when he feels joy, when he feels fear, when he feels sorrow. Thoughts can wash over him like a flood, making his breath come in gasps and his heart throb. Some- thing, like an abatement in the weather, will keep him thawed up. And then it will happen that we, who always think we are small, will feel still smaller. And we will fear to use words. But it will happen that the words we need will come of themselves. When the words we want to use shoot up of themselves-we get a new song (Rasmussen 1931:321). The likening of "an abatement in the weather" to a temporary inability to create a song is, I suggest, not metaphoric but sympathetic. All of the emotions and thoughts that of themselves dominated his consciousness were, to the poet's understanding, manifestations of the cosmic breath-soul in which his breath participated. In Iglulik belief, the Wind Owner lives in the air and wields the powers of nature, wind, sea, fog, rain, and snowstorm. According to Rasmussen (1929:71), the Wind Owner is conceived as a personification of the weather. Instead of the term sila, the terms persoq, "snowstorm," and anore, "wind," often have use. Williamson has brought out the relation in Iglulik belief of Sila to the breath-soul. Every individual is said to have as part of his soul the life force, the life- giving spirit, which is part of the whole animating force Silap Inua. This is of course something which never dies, air and the life-giving force go on indefinitely, and so then does the soul of men. When the air passes out of the body at the moment of physical death, it is simply the passing of the soul back into its original matrix (Williamson 1974:23). Belief in Sila among the inland Caribou Inuit is complicated by his syncretism with the caribou mother, an animal owner.</page><page sequence="6">28 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 Even such an outstandingly clever shaman as Igjugarjuk had difficulty in defining the spirit of Hila, declaring time after time that Hila was the same as Pinga, and that Pinga corresponded to the Nuliajuk of the coast dwellers. But as soon as we went further into the various functions of these spirits, it was found that Pinga did not quite coincide with Nuliajuk; Pinga had the special care of the caribou, whereas Hila, as among the coast dwellers, represented everything one feared in the air. There are the cold, when the sun disappears, the gales, and especially perjoq, the snowdrift, which stops all traffic under the open sky and which, when it lasts for months together, brings with it privation and death from star- vation. Everything that man fears from the air is personified in Hilap inua (Rasmussen 1930a:51). Because dialectical variants of the term Pinga, "the one up there," are epithets of Sila among the Chugach and the Copper, the epithet has likely been gained by the caribou mother only through her syn- cretism with Sila. A number of beliefs pertaining to Pinga are similarly consonant with the idea of Sila, rather than the comparative idea of the caribou mother. No one knows how she came up into the sky. No one knows what she looks like. She is responsible for requiring the traditional observances. She sees everything that occurs on earth, and she punishes violations of taboo by means of the weather and sickness (Rasmussen 1930a:49-50). Consistent with the syncretism of Sila and the caribou mother is the reduced importance of the term hila, which personifies the weather. In winter, hila is synonymous with perjoq, "blizzard, gale," and, in summer, with nipalik, "rain" (Rasmussen 1930a:27). For the Polar Inuit, in northern Greenland, sila is the vital force permeating all nature in all its many aspects. Sila means both "the whole, the universe" and "the individual powers or forces of Nature." Sila includes the weather. The Polar Inuit attribute the traditional observances to Sila. The individual human vital force, i.e. the breath- soul, is a portion of Sila. Taboo violations may cause its loss, resulting in sickness and even death (Rasmussen 1908:124; Malaurie 1982:213, 218-9). The West Greenlanders similarly attribute the full range of mean- ings to the term sila (Birket-Smith 1924:433-4). "Nature is great; Sila, as we call it ... nature, the world, the universe, all that is Sila" (Rasmussen 1927:387). Sila is also the air and a mystic power re- sponsible for the wind. Because he requires the traditional observances, Sila has the epithet Inerterrisoq, "the one who forbids." The epithet Pinga, "the one up there," also occurs, but no surviving beliefs or tradition surround it (Weyer 1932:391; Thalbitzer 1926:376; Birket- Smith 1924:439).</page><page sequence="7">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 29 The East Greenlanders had "a very ancient tradition-though in idea it was extremely vague-of a supreme being, indeed almost an all-governing deity, which was called pinga, 'the one up there,' some- times pivssuma." The tradition is again so ill-preserved that identi- fication with Sila is uncertain (Rasmussen 1938:72). To conclude, in religous belief Sila is expressly said by the Nu- nivakers and the Caribou to lack visible form. He frequently rules the cosmos and regularly rules the air. His most frequent manifestations are the wind and the snowstorm. His is a vivifying power, giving life and healing the sick. Both the Iglulik and the Polar Inuit explicitly describe the breath-soul in man as participating in Sila. In Asia, at Point Hope, in some Copper bands, and among the Caribou, Polar, and West Greenland Inuit, Sila requires the traditional observances, watches that they are kept, and punishes when they are not. In the context of Sila's inspiration of song, Sila's requirement of observances might refer to the phenomenon of conscience as well as to oral tra- ditions. Responsibility for the traditional observances is instead assigned to the Sea-woman by the Mackenzie, some Copper bands, and the Netsilik, Iglulik, and Baffin Islanders (Rasmussen 1942:57; 1932:22, 40-9; 1931:258-64; 1929:169-78; Boas 1888:593, 595). On age-and- area criteria, the distribution of the belief concerning Sila to the west, to the east, and occasionally in the middle of the intensive cult of the Sea-woman, is indicative of an older belief. No exception to this rule is provided by the Moon Owner, who requires traditional observances only in East Greenland (Rasmussen 1938:81, 201). Sila in Shamanism Hultkrantz (1973:34; 1978:11) has defined shamanism as a "re- ligious configuration," consisting of beliefs, rites, and oral narratives concerning the shaman, "a social functionary who, with the help of guardian spirits, attains ecstasy in order to create a rapport with the supernatural world on behalf of his group members." The shamanic complex presents an idea of Sila that often differs from that found in religious belief. Although there are occasional reports of shamanic seances in Alaska that were intended to ameliorate prolonged bad weather, the references are insufficiently detailed for decision as to whether Sila was involved. Data on the traditional beliefs of the Mackenzie Inuit are similarly sparse. However, Rasmussen (1942:56) mentions a belief in "Narssuk, ruler of the air," which is a name for Sila in some Copper, Netsilik, and Iglulik shamanism.</page><page sequence="8">30 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 The idea of a mystic participation in Hila is explicit in Copper shamanism. Like most Inuit shamans, Copper shamans have helping spirits of many varieties: human ghosts; animals; and fabulous, mythic beings. Copper shamans nonetheless understand these helpers to derive "almost exclusively from among the hilap inue... spirits of the air," who "all seem to be united through a great power: hilap inua itself" (Rasmussen 1932:31, 23). The shamans of some Copper bands believe that winds blow when hilap angina, "the sky's opening," has been left ajar. When a fierce storm is prolonged and famine threatens, it is the shaman's task to close the sky's opening. Rasmussen (1932:28-9) had the impression that the gap is "something that could be opened and closed from space-an entrance hole or the like." A lower Yukon myth similarly attributes the origin of the winds to holes in the walls of the sky, where the sky comes down to meet the earth. Over the holes are gut-skin covers, that sometimes keep out the winds, and sometimes do not (Nelson 1899:497-9). Other Copper bands believe that the Air Owner is an infant named Narshuk, who lives in the sky. When the infant's caribou-skin napkin loosens, the infant wails and his breath generates storm-causing winds. It is then the shaman's task to fly into the sky and to fix Narshuk's napkin (Rasmussen 1932:29). A detailed account of one such seance records that the shaman first summoned and combatted the Sea- woman, before he undertook an aerial ascent to close Narshuk's napkin (Rasmussen 1932:56-61). Apparently Narshuk cannot be placated until the Sea-woman has been forced to consent. A Copper belief legend relates that the Air Owner descended to earth in order to help a poor, orphaned boy (Rasmussen 1932:193- 4). Both the Mackenzie to the west and the Iglulik, Baffin Island, and Labrador Inuit to the east instead tell the belief legend of the Moon Owner, the guadian spirit of shamanic initiation. The prominence of the Air Owner in Copper shamanism will account for his displacement of the Moon Owner in the Copper variant. Interestingly, a Noatagmiut variant from northern Alaska pertains to the Wind Owner, "a little boy.., .with a large napkin of caribou skin fluttering about him" (Rasmussen 1952:188-90). A diffusion of the Copper tradition is sug- gested. Netsilik shamans conceive of Narssuk as well. A myth describes him as an infant giant who was orphaned during wars that the giants had with each other. Narssuk subsequently went up into the sky, where he became Sila. Narssuk, "the one with the belly," is actually a term in the shamans' esoteric language that is employed as a euphemism for Sila. Narssuk rules the wind, weather, rain, and snow. A belief legend further credits him with earthquake. He employs storms in</page><page sequence="9">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 31 order to punish women's violations of taboos concerning menses and miscarriages. This he does by loosening the thongs of his skin napkin. Because the taboos are required by the Sea-woman, it is implicit that Narssuk acts on her behalf. In order to ameliorate severe weather, Netsilik shamans ascend into the air where they must fight and over- power the infant giant before they can tie the napkin tightly to his body once more (Boas 1907:537, Rasmussen 1931:230, 258-62, 310). Iglulik shamans similarly employ Narshuk or Nartsuk as an esoteric euphemism for Sila. Narshuk is an infant giant who was orphaned when his parents were murdered. He flew up into the sky where he became the weather owner. His face is nearly human in appearance, but his face and hands are thinly covered with hair, like that of a bear. Narshuk never acts on his own. The Sea-woman requires the traditional observances. Narshuk functions as her agent in punishing mankind with storms. He wears a full, loosely fitting costume of caribou skin, as do Iglulik children. When he shakes his clothing, air rushes out of his garment, generating the winds. A shaman wishing to subdue a severe storm ascends into the air and thrashes Narshuk with a whip until he calms down (Rasmussen 1929:72-4; 1930b:77). Some Iglulik bands do not conceive of Narshuk. For them, Sila simply personifies the weather, which the Sea-woman wields directly (Rasmussen 1929:74). The Baffin Islanders make no discrete references to Sila. The Sea-woman controls the weather (Boas 1901:28-9). A Baffin Island ritual is nonetheless reminiscent of Iglulik shamans encounters with Narshuk. Storm and bad weather, when lasting a long time and causing want of food, are conjured by making a large whip of seaweed, stepping to the beach, and striking out in the direction whence the wind blows, at the same time crying Taba (It is enough) (Boas 1888:593). The Caribou Inuit syncretism of Sila with the caribou mother is an inland variant of Sila's reduction to personify the weather, in which the priorities are reversed. Where Sila has all but disappeared on the coast, the caribou mother is absent in Caribou shamanism. The initiand must exhibit himself to Hila. "Hila must see you and take notice of you, Hila must keep her eye on you." A shaman stated that, in result of his initiatory experiences, a helping spirit "came from Pinga and was a sign that Pinga had now noticed me and would give me powers that would make me a shaman." Hila/Pinga may herself function as an invisible spirit that speaks to the shaman. Hila provides advice and prophecies, and may remove disease and danger. She does not control the movements of the caribou. A sick person must abandon all his goods on the ground far away from humanity. The Caribou</page><page sequence="10">32 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 explain, "If a sick person is to have any hope of being cured, he must own nothing but his breath." Hila's connection with the breath-soul is evident (Rasmussen 1930a:46-53). In East Greenland, the several winds had as many owners. Shamans undertook journeys into the air to a wind owner, either to cause a wind to blow or to stop it from blowing. The motif of whipping the wind recurs. A shaman alternatively stuck a wind owner with a knife (Holm 1911:88, 96; Weyer 1932:391). Rasmussen (1938:94) suggested that Asiaq, a feminine rain owner, also owns the winds. Weyer (1932:392) maintains that Asiaq should not be equated with Sila, but instead regarded as a separate conception. There is a widespread Inuit myth of two sisters, or sometimes a brother and a sister, who became thunder and lightning. A Baffin Island variant speaks of three sisters: thunder, lightning, and rain (Boas 1888:600). In Labrador, female spirits are again responsible for rain and thunder (Hawkes 1916:98). In West Greenland, rain is attributed to the overflow of the lake in heaven (Birket-Smith 1924:435). There is consequently no reason to assume that every rain owner is to be identified with Sila. To conclude, the available evidence of the idea of Sila in Inuit shamanism is adequate only for some Canadian groups. In this region, the function of Sila in shamanism is restricted almost exclusively to his governance of the winds and storm. Only the Caribou shamans additionally appeal to Sila in order to combat disease and witchcraft. Sila is a World Owner in religious belief, but he functions only as a Wind Owner in shamanism. No contradiction is involved; neither is it correct to explain the limited cult by characterizing Sila as otiose. Because the continuing existence of the cosmos may be taken for granted, there is simply no need for shamans to appeal to Sila except when desiring him to provide changes in the weather or, in the Caribou instance, the vivifying power necessary for healing. Two major conceptions of Sila occur in the shamanic complex. Some Copper bands, together with the inland Caribou, do not an- thropomorphize Sila but instead conceive of him in a fashion closely consistent with the comparative idea of Sila that is found in religious beliefs. Other Copper bands, together with the Netsilik and some Iglulik bands, anthropomorphize Sila as Narssuk, who is always sub- ordinate to the Sea-woman. The Sea-woman displaces Sila completely in other Iglulik shamanism and on Baffin Island. Sila in Myth A mythologem is a mythic theme (Jensen 1963:92). Most of the mythic conceptions of Sila that are offered in statements of belief are</page><page sequence="11">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 33 mythologems, as distinct from the lengthier narratives that are properly to be termed myths. There is a general Inuit belief that the moon and the sun are a brother and a sister. A minority tradition, limited to Alaska, reverses the genders and overlaps with the conception of the World Owner. The Chugach identify the sun with tlam-shua and attribute control of the weather to the sun. Prayers are addressed to the sun in order to avert storms (Birket-Smith 1953:120-1). The Koniag word hlak means "pure air" and "light." Hlam-shua, the World Owner, can mean "the Light Owner." A Koniag tradition describes the sun as male (Weyer 1932:390, Lantis 1938:136). The myth of the origin of Nunivak Island, told at Cape Etolin, describes the World Owner as a woman (Curtis 1930:77-8). Because the Nunivakers do not anthropomorphize the World Owner (Lantis 1946:197), the myth is problematic. However, a variant from Nash Harbour describes the creative woman as the moon (Curtis 1930:74-5). Further instances of the World Owner's relation to the sun are from Canada. Some Copper bands conceive of Sila as a man who walks along the sky. As he walks, the sun goes down, causing sunset each evening (Jenness 1922:179). In the Netsilik shamanic language, the expressions "Narssuk gets up" and "Narssuk goes to rest" are employed as euphemisms for "morning" and "darkness falls." Iglulik shamans say "Narshuk is about to sit down" instead of "it is growing dark" (Rasmussen 1931:310; 1930b:77). The mythologem of Sila's relation to the sun has greater significance as it occurs in a common figure of speech. The phrase sila maligdlugo, literally "according to sila," connotes "according to the world order." The course of life from birth to death is "according to world order." The phrase is also used of the course of the sun, from left to right across the southern sky. A considerable variety of ritual actions involve motions made left to right, "according to the world order." The phrase sila agssordlugo, "contrary to the world order," is used of motions right to left, which play a role in the rites of Inuit witchcraft (Petersen 1966-67:262). The Netsilik myth of Narssuk includes the detail that the giant Inugpasugssuk, who adopted the infant, used to amuse himself by having the Inuit women, who came to look at the enormous baby, sit on Narssuk's penis. Narssuk's penis was so large that four women could sit side by side at the same time (Rasmussen 1931:230). The Netsilik, Caribou, and Polar Inuit relate that a giant exchanged wives with an Inuit friend. The man fell down into the giantess' genitals and died. When the giant thrust his penis into the woman, he split her and she died too (Rasmussen 1931:427; 1930b: 114, Holtved 1951:39). The cosmic scope of Sila's vivifying power informs the comic motifs.</page><page sequence="12">34 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 Similar ideas of cosmic scope and vivifying power occur in further mythologems pertaining to Sila. The Netsilik say that, deep within the earth, there are large eggs called silagsat, "something that will become sila." Some of these earth eggs turned into musk oxen (Ras- mussen 1931:265). The Iglulik believe that the silagsat are the size of walrus bladders. Out of them come all albino caribou, seals, and other animals. A variant states that the eggs give issue to silat or silaraluit, animals shaped like giant caribou but having large snouts and hair like lemmings (Boas 1907:493; Rasmussen 1929:202-3). On Baffin Island, the earth eggs are said to give origin to albino seals and deer (Boas 1888:640). In East Greenland, the cosmos is said to have the shape of an egg (Thalbitzer 1930:83). West Greenland myths maintain that mankind descends from a giant named Kallak, who arose from the earth and had sex with her. The earth bore him a daughter, whom he married (Rink 1875:38, Birket-Smith 1924:440-1). An interpretive equation of the snow-colored progeny of the eggs with the giant Kallak will render the motifs mutually coherent. In addition to the shamanic conceptions of the sky's opening and Narssuk's flapping napkin or clothing, further mythologems concern the generation of the winds. A Koniag myth tells of a man who sits on top of a northwestern cape and creates the prevailing, violent wind by blowing with his mouth. The other winds are created similarly. A man prevents them from blowing by filling the mouths of their owners with moss (Lantis 1938:137-8). At Unalakleet, on Norton Sound, a myth describes a giant, Kinak or Kinagak, who, in clearing his lungs of hoarfrost that accumulates while he sleeps, so exhales that he creates furious gales. He lives in the north and creates the fierce north winds of winter (Nelson 1899:471-3). The motifs compare with Asiatic Inuit beliefs that the wind is the angry breathing of the World Owner. He is depicted in stories as a man with a wife, and sometimes children, who owns a dog sled, a kayak, and hunting equipment, and hunts for his living (Menovscikov 1968:441, 447-8). Similar motifs recur to the east of the Narssuk conception. The Labrador Inuit believe that the winds are caused by the breaths of different male and female owners, who dwell in the various directions. The north wind, which produces violent, winter snowstorms, is the breath of a giant (Turner 1894:267, Hawkes 1916:153). The West Greenlanders tell of a giant named Pompeja, who dwells on the inland ice. He blows cold wind from his mouth, but a strong, warm wind by flatulation (Birket-Smith 1924:435). On age-and-area criteria, the motif of the adult giant, which occurs both in the west and the east, plainly antedates the motif of the infant giant Narssuk, which is limited to the central region. The adult giant</page><page sequence="13">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 35 has been reduced to an infant in order to express his subordination to the Sea-woman. A further mythologem cannot be linked empirically to Sila, but readily affords such an interpretation. The mythologem of the giant whose breath is the wind has a West Greenland variant. A myth tells of a one-eyed giant who, from the highest peak of the Kingigstoq Fjeld, beat his arms as though he were a bird flapping wings. Not only did he fly, but the motions of his arms caused a storm (Rasmussen 1908:237-41). The motif is presumably an adaptation of the different mythologem of the storm bird. A thunderbird occurs in a lower Yukon myth (Nelson 1899:186). The Copper attribute thunder, but neither winds nor storms, to small birds called kagluk (Rasmussen 1932:24). A Netsilik myth tells of a woman who wed a sea bird whose wings generated winds that caused a storm at sea (Rasmussen 1931:498). The Iglulik, Baffin Island, and Polar Inuit relate the same myth, con cerning a petrel or a fulmar, the largest of Arctic sea birds, as part of longer myths about the Sea-woman (Rasmussen 1929:63-6; Boas 1888:583-5; Holtved 1951:21-3). Since the Sea-woman owns animalia, a theriomorphic conception of Sila expresses his subordination to the Sea-woman. Presumably for this same reason, a theriomorphic con ception has not generally been favored. Mythological tales, or myths of entertainment (Hultkrantz 1979:9 1) in which giants figure, are a frequent part of Inuit folklore. Perhaps because many are comic tales and/or negative examples, they are not told about Sila. Still, at least some of them seem to be informed by the idea of Sila. The Kotzebue, in northern Alaska, tell of a giant who sleeps in the autumn and winter and is awake in the spring and summer (Rasmussen 1952:237-9). The motif compares with the my- thologem of Sila and the diurnal course of the sun, as well as with hibernating animals. A Mackenzie tale is perhaps based on the meaning of Narssuk, "the one with the belly." It seems to parody a type of myth that the Inuit do not tell: cosmogenesis through the dismemberment of a giant. A giant ate a polar cod, a fjord seal, a walrus, and, finally, a white whale. Then he went inland and drank a lake until it was dry. Still thirsty, he drained part of a second lake. When he returned home to his grandmother's house, he was too large to enter through the passage, or the window, or the roof-hole. So he came in through the eye of his grandmother's sewing needle. When she lit a fire, a chip of fuel exploded. He caught on fire, and he burst. All of the sea animals within him streamed out, carried along by the water he had drunk, down to the salt sea (Rasmussen 1942:132-5).</page><page sequence="14">36 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 Conclusions Considered as an instance of a phenomenological type of deity, the Inuit idea of Sila conforms excellently with the phenomenology of "the Supreme Being of the primitive culture" documented in its several aspects by Schmidt (1931:262-82). To characterize Sila as a supreme being is, however, inaccurate. If we ignore, as a secondary development, Sila's subordination to the Sea-woman in the central region, Sila may be described as the supreme being of the physical universe; but the Inuit also conceive of two further dimensions of existence. Atop the celestial firmament is a supercelestial land, a happy place of bountiful game, where the Moon Owner rules supreme. At the bottom of the sea there is a monotonous dismal netherworld, where the Sea-woman makes her home. As a rule, the three deities are independent. Each is supreme within a third part of existence. In religous belief, in shamanism, and in mythology, much the same geographical pattern occurs. The idea of Sila as a cosmic breath- soul has general distribution, but in the heartland of the cult of the Sea-woman, Sila has been replaced by the Sea-woman with respect to the traditional observances and their enforcement. Some Copper bands and the Caribou have a shamanism consistent with the older idea of Sila; but the conception of Narssuk, who is subordinate to the Sea-woman, is distributed in the areas where the Sea-woman governs traditional observances. The mythic motif of an adult giant has a distribution consistent with the older idea of Sila. The infant giant Narssuk and the storm bird are consistent with the supremacy of the Sea-woman in the heartland of her cult. The idea of Sila may be related to the masculine conception of the sun among the south Alaskan Inuit. A relation to the sun is also found in west-central Canada, and in the widespread notion in common speech and in ritual, that the sun's motion from left to right proceeds "according to sila." How these materials interfit with the cult of the Moon Owner, whose sister is the Sun Owner, must await future research to discover. By way of closing, a few words of speculation are in order. Arbman, followed by Hultkrantz (1953:24-8), theorized that the conception of the free-soul has its basis in dreams and ecstasies, while the idea of the breath-soul arises through the logical reflection that some power animates the body even when the free-soul is absent. In order to account for the development from the idea of an individual breath- soul to that of the cosmos, some further explanation is needed. A clue is provided in that the idea of a Wind Owner, in which all individual breath-souls participate, is emphatically mystical. Although the con-</page><page sequence="15">MERKUR: BREATH-SOUL AND WIND OWNER 37 ception may be within the reach of sober non-rationality, it is more likely to be inspired by unitive experiences. In particular, the external orientation to nature in the idea of Sila is consistent with the type of mysticism that Stace (1960) has termed "extrovertive." Such an interpretation must be offered, however, as theory. Direct evidence is not available. Because shamans are social functionaries, ecstatic tra- ditions whose primary orientation is toward shamanizing tend not to give cultural prominence to solitary and non-social experiences of unity. Paper (1980, 1982) has argued that unitive experiences nonetheless occur to shamans. The Inuit idea of Sila may perhaps be treated as indirect evidence to the same effect. On psychological criteria, we may of course expect nothing less. REFERENCES Arbman, Ernst 1939 Mythic and Religious Thought. Lund, Sweden: Dragma, Martino P Nilsson.
