<plain_text><page sequence="1">Migration: Paths through Time and Space. R. Robin Baker. 248 pp. New York: Holmes and Meier, 1982. $32.50 cloth, $15.95 paper. The first of the two main themes ad vanced here is that animals combine in formation from "exploratory migrations" undertaken when young with innate orientation abilities?e.g., to the sun or magnetic fields?to guide themselves over their "lifetime tracks." The second is that anthropomorphism is now ac ceptable because humans and animals are not so different after all. Both themes are used to support the notion that studies of migration are part of a grand, new hol istic "behavioral ecology," encompassing man and animals, replacing the bad old reductionist ethology. The tone is set with a quotation from Hinton: "It's a good sign if nobody be lieves you?as long as you are right." The ensuing polemical style makes the book of dubious value to undergraduates, for whom it is apparently intended. There is far too much personal bias and exagger ated sense of rectitude for it to be ac ceptable as "a basis for the study of ani mal behavior in general." There are also other problems. To begin with, the book is concerned more with navigation and orientation than migration. "Why" questions, as for ex ample, why some animals migrate while others do not, are absent. Indeed, the author seems to have little understanding of genetic and environmental variation in evolution. Furthermore, he presents only that side of a controversy which supports his viewpoint. We are baldly told that the "acceptance of apparently altruistic behavior is no longer a prob lem/' that pigeons use smell to navigate, and that there is a "new-found [by Baker!] human magnetic sense." In the latter case, no mention is made of the fact that others have failed to demonstrate this sense, and that Baker himself failed in cooperative experiments with others and with outside observers present. In sum, this is much too one-sided a book to be useful as an introduction to migra tion.?Hugh Dingle, Entomology, University of California, Davis</page></plain_text>
