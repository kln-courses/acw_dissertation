Weinfeld offers not a commentary but an introduction to the deu- teronomic writings which is surely the most important work of its kind to appear in recent years. It is full of information, and Weinfeld argues his case with force and precision. He claims that the deuteronomic wri- tings are the work of scribal circles associated with the royal court. These scribes are said to have become influential in the reign of Hezekiah and to have continued and even increased their power under succeeding kings. This fixes a terminus a quo for dating the writings which corre- sponds to the commonly-held opinion which assigns the origins of Deuter- onomy to the latter half of the 8th century B.C. However, it goes against the common idea about place of origin by putting it squarely in Jerusa- lem and not in the northern kingdom (or at least in circles influenced from the north and not part of the Judean establishment). And perhaps most important, it argues for a different cultural setting from that commonly posited for the deuteronomic writings. These writings would be the work not of levites basically concerned with sacral traditions but of a school whose central norms were drawn from Wisdom traditions. The basic argument for all these suggestions, of course, is drawn from the use of Wisdom language and ideas in the deuteronomic writings. Particularly interesting here is Weinfeld's use of the parallels between the Book of Deuteronomy itself and the Assyrian treaties to establish a connection with the Wisdom tradition. He argues that such elaborate and refined legal traditions as the treaty form must surely have been at home among chancery personnel. That is, the parallels establish a connection with circles where scribal Wisdom flourished. One may have reservations about identifying the sources of Wisdom features in the deuteronomic writings with such precision. It is not cer- tain that their origins and setting can be identified so exactly. However, there can be little question about the fact that Wisdom language and ideas occur in the deuteronomic writings. This has been argued before, and Weinfeld has added a good deal of additional evidence. Probably more objections will be raised against the treaty parallel. There is a fash- ion at the moment to reject any claim that the Old Testament used the ancient treaty form. But this is a matter of fashion. The fact is that there is a very strong case for the treaty form in Deuteronomy, and Weinfeld has summarized this well and advanced important new argu- ments for it. He rightly eschews the arguments which depend on a cove- nant cult in Israel. This is probably not a false route, but it is a difficult and obscure one. Rather he insists on literary phenomena, pointing to the parallels in detail between Deuteronomy and the treaties and ad- ding important observations of his own. Of special interest is the remarkable coincidence between Dt 28,26- 30 and the Esarhaddon treaties to which he calls attention. In both lists the evils occur in exactly the same order. As Weinfeld argues, the sequence</page><page sequence="2">Recensiones 449 is quite arbitrary so that the coincidence cannot be the result of simi- lar logic in parallel situations. Either it is pure chance, not impossible but unlikely, or it must be due to some connection between the texts, and it is not hard to imagine an acquaintance with the techniques of the Assyrian treaty in 8th century Palestine. We have, of course, long known that the curses in Deuteronomy, like the threats in the prophets, depend on an ancient tradition of cursing which appears also in the treaties. The trouble has been that these curses are a rhetorical commonplace. They could be and were used in texts other than the treaties. Hence their echoes in the Bible need not be taken as showing a connection with the treaties as such. These echoes simply confirmed the self evident: Old Testament literature belongs within the larger ancient Near Eastern tradition. Weinfeld has now shown that the connection goes beyond this general tie. There is a link between Deuteronomy and a specific feature which appears only in a treaty. Weinfeld makes a second point of great interest in regard to the treaty and the covenant. He distinguishes the law covenant from the vassal covenant. The types are not absolutely distinct, but they are dif- ferent. The first type may be seen in the covenant mediated by Moses as described in Exodus and in Josiah's covenant, the second in the cere- mony described in Jos 24. Deuteronomy combines aspects of both. This distinction is perhaps not novel, but it is important that Weinfeld lo- cates the setting of each type. The vassal covenant regulated relations be- tween persons, sovereign and subjects. It had a specific social, cultural, and political context which must be considered in any interpretation of the form. This is well known. But what of law covenant ? It was the act of a king, the establishment of righteous law for his kingdom. Character- istically this was associated with the beginnings of reigns. They inaugu- rated new eras of justice. However, it could occur at any time: witness Hammurabi's establishment of righteous laws in his great code. The parallels with David (2 Sm 8,15) and Josiah are obvious. Royal practice provides the setting for law covenant. At first glance it would appear that the Bible has confused things separate in the parent legal tradition by designating as " covenant'' both the formal establishment of justice and the formal treaty. But is this really the case ? In the extrabiblical cases the "establishment of right- eous law" and the treaties have something in common distinguishing them from ordinary law. The latter seems largely to have been customary law. It derived from precedent and not from royal decree. The former, on the other hand, are both royal acts. They are done by decree (we usually forget that the treaties are royal decrees assented to by oath). Even before their appearance in the Bible the two things which the Bible has designated as covenants had something in common. They were spe- cial acts of kings. The implications of all this for the nature of covenant, the relation of law and covenant, and the place of the king in a covenant scheme must not be ignored in future study. Weinfeld, then, has made an important contribution in pointing out the depth and breadth of the influence from Wisdom traditions on the</page><page sequence="3">450 Recensiones deuteronomic writings, in elaborating the treaty character of Deuteron- omy, and in clarifying the setting of covenant forms. There are other aspects of his work which one must question. For instance, there is the problem of the relation between Deuteronomy and P. Weinfeld reverses Wellhausen's view in that he holds that Deuteronomy depends on P, but he still sees the question in terms of documents and bases his argu- ment on the fact that Deuteronomy deals with matters familiar from P. However, that does not really mean that there must have been a di- rect evolutionary connection between the two documents. The psalms and the tradition history of cultic law demonstrate that the tradition crystallized in P was already strong long before there was a P document. Thus Deuteronomy might have come in contact with the tradition which produced P, not with that document itself. This fact complicates the problem of the relative dates of the documents, but Weinfeld has not taken sufficient account of it. In view of this, one cannot interpret Deu- teronomy as a secularizing development of the doctrine of the P docu- ment and treat it as evidence that as a rule later ideas tended away from the sacral. P and Deuteronomy would rather represent different tendencies, one of which, P, actually became more firmly sacral. The sacral and the secular, then, cannot be treated as stages in an evolution- ary process and so used to establish relative dates. In fact, one wonders about the use of "secular" at all in this kind of context. The facts involved are not in dispute. Certain symbols are used in Deuteronomy and others are not. The "name" stands for the divine presence rather than the "glory" of cloud and fire, and the law receives a new kind of importance. The differences in language and ideas are enough in themselves for the purposes of introduction. They help us relate the texts to one another, to date them, etc. I am not sure that "secularity" does this. Can we argue to a connection between two things because they are less sacral than some others? And if we could, what do we mean by "less sacral" in the concrete biblical context? Weinfeld follows common practice in equating the sacral with the ritual, the concrete, the anthropomorphic, and the irrational. The sign of the sacral is the tabu. But these things do not always go hand in hand. Take the matter of symbols of the divine presence. The P tradition uses the cloud, the "glory", as such a symbol, the Deuteronomic tradition prefers the "name". The latter may be called more rational because it is a verbal symbol, the sort of thing a certain kind of discursive thought can easily handle. However, it is also more anthropomorphic: it applies an ordinary legal category - the name designating the owner of real property - to God. So it purports to tell us something concrete about God as the cloud does not. The cloud is a visual symbol which points to a presence which cannot be pictured imaginatively and so is more abstract than the image of ownership. Anthropomorphism, abstraction, and the rest turn out to be complex things with different interrelat- ions. They do not define the sacral without further ado. The real point is the religious dimension of the symbol, its relation to the numinous. Does it arouse awe? Here the tendency is to think primarily of primitive feelings in regard to the tabu and the strange objects</page><page sequence="4">Recensiones 451 connected with it. But this is not the only nor the most important example of the mysterious and awesome, in sum, of the sacred. The name is as much an occasion of awe as the cloud. Indeed, more so if the "name mysticism" of Judaism and Christianity means anything. So also with the law. It may well be that deuteronomic law explains itself in humanistic terms. That is, it appeals to basic human needs, to feelings of justice, pity, and the like, to motivate or explain. But this is simply to spell out the reality of all law in the ancient world. By and large it was a codification of experience based on human needs and feel- ings. But what does the law mean as a religious phenomenon? Surely Deuteronomy is at the heart of the Jewish response to the law as the awesome sign of the divine presence, the point of contact par excellence with the numinous (cf. Dt 4,7-8). It would be better if we would take account of things like this before we speak too easily about the secular and the sacred in the Bible. Nor can we shy away from this sort of thing on the plea that it is a more speculative problem than those we are accus- tomed to deal with in introduction or exegesis. It is a real problem rel- evant to the meaning and setting of important parts of the Bible. We cannot let it go by default. There are other problems raised by Weinfeld's work which, though not more important, are more familiar than the problem of defining the secular and the sacral. They seem to me to be inherent in the whole en- terprise which goes under the rubric "introduction". In this discipline tradition demands that one come to firm conclusions about times and places and authors. To do this one is forced to make firm decisions in matters where the evidence is less than clear, or the argument less than apodictic. Some examples from the book in hand follow. A sharp distinction is drawn between priests and levites, and be- tween the functions of the latter in the pre-exilic and post-exilic periods. We are assured that only in the later community were the levites teachers. Perhaps, but do we know enough about the levitical role in earlier times to be sure? Again, the concern for apostasy in Deuteronomy and speci- fically the laws against permitting secret apostasy are connected with the characteristic stipulation of the vassal treaties demanding that sedi- tion be reported to an overlord. A connection is not impossible, but the similarity is not so great nor the thing itself so singular as to force one to conclude to a connection. Or, we are assured that Jeremiah "fully identified himself with the religious ideology of the Book of Deuteron- omy". This may be, and then again it may not. Or, we are told that Dt 17,14-20 is pro-monarchical! Or, it is claimed that the deuteronomic concern with possession of the land by conquest (yrš ha āres) is a parallel to the assurances of the Wisdom tradition that the prudent man will retain his land. These are but random samples. Many more could be cited. One must emphasize that the problem is not peculiar to this book. It is characteristic of the genre. The drive for clear affirmations in every detail continually forces us to speak surely on the basis of unsure evidence. However, the problem is not merely one of detail. Consider the prob- lem of ťfie authors of the deuteronomic writings. Wisdom traits are</page><page sequence="5">452 Recensiones clearly in evidence in the deuteronomic writings. And no doubt the trea- ties which were the model for Deuteronomy were known to the chancery scribes who were also schooled in Wisdom. Hence the conclusion: Deuter- onomy and the deuteronomistic writings are the work of scribal circles active in the administration of Judah. And when? Why, under Heze- kiah when the scribes became especially prominent. All this is reasonable. Even probable. The trouble with probable propositions is that the alter- natives remain probable. Surely Wisdom elements were characteristic of the formation of all educated classes! Thus a cultured prophet like Isaiah is full of Wisdom traits. And there weis a Wisdom appropriate for the priestly and the noble classes (see W. Richter, Recht und Ethos [St ANT 12; Munich 1966]). It is impossible, therefore, to assign any work to a given group simply because it had Wisdom traits. One might as well assign all 18th century English literature to classics professors because it is full of Latin tags and classical allusions. These things were the property of any educated man. So„ it seems, was Wisdom in ancient Israel. Any educated man or group in Judah who knew the political situation of his country might have produced a work which showed knowledge of the treaties and of Wisdom themes. The difficulty arises from the questions we ask. One seeks a speci- fic source and so one passes from Wisdom traits to a specific source of Wisdom. But need one do this ? Does is really matter all that much that Deuteronomy came from a court scribe? What really counts is the con- nection with Wisdom language and Wisdom ideas. When this is estab- lished interpretation can profitably proceed by showing how Wisdom ideas are at work in the whole, as well as how individual details are elucidated when studied from a Wisdom context. And the same is true of the treaty parallel. It is in the text, and studying the text as a treaty form will be enlightening no matter who may have written it. The question is whe- ther we are chiefly concerned with studying the text and using what we can find out about the circumstances of the text to that end, or whether we are chiefly concerned with the history of Israel and its literature so that the text becomes an accessory to that history. Ideally we should prefer the former task; historically we have tended to get bogged down in the latter. In so far as Weinfeld does this latter he is much like the rest of us. But by making clear the literary (Wisdom) and legal (i.e., the treaty) elements basic to the deuteronomistic writings he has per- formed a great service in opening the way to the former.
