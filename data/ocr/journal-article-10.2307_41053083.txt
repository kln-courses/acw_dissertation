Fish1 and Suzanne K. Fish1 Research within the last 3 to 5 years is summarized for the southern part of the southwestern United States and adjacent northwest Mexico. In an effort to identify important new sources of information, the literature of contract archaeology is cited, along with more widely available journal and book publications. Topics considered include Late Archaic farmers, early ceramic villages, subsistence and agricultural technology, settlement stability and residential mobility, community organization, and developments of the late prehistoric period sociopolitical complexity. KEY WORDS: northwest Mexico; southern Southwest; prehistoric farmers; community organization; social complexity. INTRODUCTION The mission of this review is a comprehensive summary of recent re- search in a binational area covering the southern part of the southwestern United States and adjacent northwestern Mexico (Figs. 1 and 2). We in- troduce the designation SSNM for want of a better term or acronym. This area not only lacks recognition as a traditional unit of archaeological analy- sis, but also recombines more familiar divisions. One of our first tasks is to specify further the area of discussion and to justify its coherency in terms of cultural patterns and relationships in the past. 1Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721. 1059-01 61/94/0300-0003S07.00/0 O 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">4 Fish and Fish | ARIZONA NE W /M E X I C O • N , |*Albuquerque ^^üü-v I ^vQJnited Stotes | J '^ f k 1 , I "••..ic."-^" x TEXAS f ( 'L •- ' • ^;- '•• c ■■•-'*'' ' ' ' ' 'r- SONORA 'V' f^.fic b A ' I ■ ' il '¿ ../,, ,^ &gt;V/f'J V ^-.CHIHUAHUA 1 ■ Oc eon ' 11 ° ^^¿ X% XS'iO'&gt;P V'^'"^^. 0 3OOMiles^ N ^§ ^-^--.^-''.

Important place names and archaeological sites mentioned in the text. Archaeological sites are indicated by numbers: (1) Huatabampo; (2) Convento Site and Casas Grandes; (3) Bat Cave; (4) Las Trincheras; (5) Casa Grande; (6) Mesa Grande; (7) Pueblo Grande; (8) Cucurpe (El Ranchito); (9) Caborca (La Preevadora); (10) Fronteras (Ojo de Aqua); (11) Snaketown. This summary is intended to be comprehensible to readers who are not regional specialists and to provide entry into SSNM literature for any interested scholar. We attempted to incorporate publications of the last 3 years systematically in text citations and bibliographies but could not include all previous relevant works. Many references are publications that are not easily obtained, primarily in the literature of contract archaeology. Nevertheless, these contain substantial information and influential interpretations that are unavailable elsewhere. The compression of information in deference to page limits forced us to adopt a telegraphic style of presentation; we sometimes gloss over the complexity of arguments and cannot always detail authorship for opposing viewpoints or even key concepts. We hope that the extensive bibliographic entries will alleviate these omissions.</page><page sequence="4">6 Fish and Fish REGIONAL DEFINITION Environmental Coherence The SSNM forms an arc of lower-elevation basin and range country between the mountainous Mogollón Rim, spanning eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, and the northern mass of the Sierra Madre Occidental in northern Sonora and Chihuahua (Fig. 1). The environmental coherency of the SSNM for agricultural populations contrasts with the differing con- ditions and economic orientations on its borders. Groups with predominantly hunting and gathering economies inhabited the dry western fringe along the Gulf of California (Villalpando C, 1989, 1990, 1991) and the arid eastern borders in Texas (Kelley, 1986; Upham, 1992). Higher-elevation farming ad- aptations characterize most adjoining territory on the north and south. The great majority of the SSNM lies within the Sonoran (west) and Chihuahuan (east) deserts (Brown, 1982). With the exception of strips bordering massive uplands, the annual precipitation is no greater than 350 mm, and supple- mental water must be supplied for successful farming (Braniff C, 1989; S. Fish and Nabhan, 1991, pp. 37-38). Mixes of prehistoric agricultural techniques varied with topography and hydrology within and among SSNM basins (Doolittle, 1988, 1993; S. Fish and Fish, 1990; S. Fish and Nabhan, 1991; Masse, 1991; Mitchell, 1988a). Large portions of basin interiors are occupied by valley slopes that, under regimes of adequate rainfall, were farmed by diversion of the largest secondary drainages, concentration of surface runoff, and floodwater tech- niques on alluvial fans. The potential for desert irrigation is limited largely to basin floors. Extensive canal systems were constructed where rivers pos- sessing upland or unusually large watersheds coincided with broad, flat expanses of basin floor. Such cooccurrences also identify locations of the densest population and highest levels of territorial integration. Cultural Coherency Cultural interrelationships that span the southern Southwest of the United States and northwestern Mexico are of a nature and scale tran- scending individual archaeological cultures, ethnic identities, or linguistic affiliations during any period of history or prehistory. The area can be cul- turally defined as an analytical entity by means of broad contrasts with neighboring areas, although boundaries are variable over time, consistently permeable, and always subject to exceptions. At the most general level, the SSNM was inhabited by societies beyond the northern extent of those</page><page sequence="5">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 7 possessing Mesoamerican traits and south of those embodying the Anasazi tradition that epitomizes indigenous development in the Southwest. The portion of the SSNM in the United States is often characterized as reflect- ing Mexican influences (e.g., P. Fish, 1989; Foster, 1989; Wilcox, 1986, 1987a, 1991a, b), while Southwestern affinities are ascribed to the portion in northern Mexico (e.g., Cordell, 1984; McGuire, 1989; Phillips, 1989a, b; Riley, 1987). Paul Minnis (1989) has referred to the intersection of Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, and Chihuahua as the "International Four Corners" in order to emphasize the cultural centrality of the SSNM in the Greater Southwest (Kirchhoff, 1954). The geographic rationale for a degree of cultural coherency among peoples of the SSNM goes beyond environmental commonalities in agri- cultural orientations. Compared to extensive neighboring highlands, the lower basins of the SSNM offer few significant topographic barriers to in- ternal travel and communication. The wide, rugged, and high backbone of the Sierra Madre Occidental presents a daunting impediment to east-west interchange in northwest Mexico. Some transport of lightweight and high- value items may have occurred over mountain passes (Di Peso, 1974, Vol. 6, p. 401), but a more natural flow of items, ideas, and people is to the north around these mountains, creating the potential for interdigitating contacts throughout the arc of the SSNM. During various prehistoric periods, trade goods such as ceramics, shell, copper bells, macaws, and perhaps turquoise circulated through large seg- ments of this territory. Evidence cited for transregional interconnections in- cludes the precise depictions of marine life in Mimbres art, which imply visits by artists from southwestern New Mexico to the Gulf of California (Jett and Moyle, 1986), the Hohokam trade routes to the same destination marked by Hohokam styles of rock art and pottery from southern Arizona (Hayden, 1972), and an early historic linguistic corridor of mutually intelligible Tepiman dialects that stretched south from central Arizona along the western coast of Mexico beyond the boundary of the SSNM (Wilcox, 1986, 1991b). Large segments of this territory also shared complexes of stylistic traits such as the similar suites of ceramic decoration, palettes, stone bowls, projectile points, shell, and axes in the Hohokam and Mimbres traditions just before A.D. 1000 (LeBlanc, 1986, 1989, pp. 184-185). In late prehistoric times, after A.D. 1350, the combined and highly overlapping distributions of Salado and Chihuahuan polychrome ceramics encompass virtually all of the SSNM, from the Rio Conchos on the east (Kelley, 1986; Phillips, 1989a, pp. 384-385) to the Trincheras area of northwest Sonora (Bowen, 1976; Phillips, 1989a, p. 390). If widespread late polychrome styles represent iconographie symbolism, their distribu- tional significance extends beyond trade or emulation to identify spheres</page><page sequence="6">8 Fish and Fish of shared ideologies (Adams, 1991; Crown, 1993). Although a common cult may be implied for core areas of these polychrome styles, it is doubt- ful that an equivalent degree of adherence can be projected to the en- tirety of the distributions. Indeed, in addition to both Salado and Chihuahuan polychromes, sites in some segments of the SSNM also con- tain later Jeddito wares (Crown, 1991; Doyel, 1991), a similarly wide- spread and iconographically oriented northern polychrome style (Adams, 1991). At the least, the distributions of Salado and Chihuahuan poly- chromes in the SSNM identify vast areas of stylistic sharing and exchange (Crown, 1993, McGuire, 1991; Minnis, 1989; Wilcox and Sternberg, 1983, p. 244), indicating the desirability and probable comprehensibility of these designs. Adobe complexes with contiguous rectangular rooms were also adopted as an architectural style throughout most of the SSNM dur- ing the late polychrome period. CURRENT RESEARCH Subareas The coverage of recent as well as cumulative research in the SSNM is highly uneven. The majority of investigations are concentrated in areas of present population and locations affected by related improvements to infrastructure. In fact, the eastern leg of the SSNM is arbitrarily bounded on the south in Mexico for lack of knowledge about regional archaeology. An explosion of governmentally mandated funding in con- junction with construction and land development in the United States has magnified this geographic imbalance. Research supported by other means is limited to widely scattered efforts of a smaller magnitude in both countries. Among dozens of well-funded contract projects in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, many with budgets exceeding several hundred thousand dollars have investigated Hohokam and closely related remains in central and southern Arizona (e.g., Ackerly and Henderson, 1989; Chenault et al, 1992; Ciolek-Torrello and Wilcox, 1988; Czaplicki and Ravesloot, 1989; Foster, 1993; Gasser et al, 1990; Green, 1989; Greenwald and Ahlstrom, 1992; Henderson and Martynec, 1992; Mitchell, 1988b, 1989a, b, 1990; Ravesloot, 1987; Rice, 1987a, b; Teague and Crown, 1984; Teague and Deaver, 1989). Until the last several years, these largest undertakings were concentrated in the greater Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas and along the intervening pathway of the Central Arizona Project aqueduct constructions. Now, substantial work extends east to the Tonto Basin (Ciolek-Torrello</page><page sequence="7">Southern Southwest V.SA, and Northwest Mexico 9 et a¿, 1990; Doelle et al, 1992; Elson and Craig, 1992; Lange and Germick, 1992; Redman et al, 1992; Rice, 1990) and north along the lower Verde River (Hackbarth, 1992; Neily and Kisselburg, 1991; Seymour et ai, 1991; Whittlesey, 1993). Many of these projects include an increment of survey, but the greatest contribution to regional knowledge is through excavations at hundreds of large and small sites. Although modestly funded, studies partially or totally supported by alternative sources have emphasized research objectives that are less fre- quently pursued under contract strictures. One such goal is the survey of regional-scale study areas defined by archaeological rather than manage- ment or mitigation criteria. Such surveys have been conducted in Arizona near Tucson (Dart et ai, 1990; Doelle et al, 1985; Downum, 1993a; S. Fish et al, 1992) and along the San Pedro (Altschul and Jones, 1990) and San Simon (Gilman, 1991) drainages. Another research emphasis is the systematic compilation and analysis of distributional data. Artifact studies examine Hohokam exchange and status (e.g., Crown, 1991; Doyel, 1991; Mitchell, 1991, 1992; McGuire, 1992; Nelson, 1991; Teague, 1984). With increasing regularity, distributional stud- ies are accompanied by compositional analyses to determine locations of production (e.g., Abbott and Schaller, 1992; Bostwick and Burton, 1993; Crown, 1993; P. Fish et al, 1992a; Shackley, 1991, 1992). Distributions of public architecture and other settlement variables provide insight into ter- ritorial and sociopolitical organization on a variety of geographic scales (Crown, 1987; S. Fish and Fish, 1993; Gregory, 1991; Howard, 1987; Wilcox, 1991a). Important new information has been derived from archival studies of major excavations that were undertaken during the early days of Hohokam archaeology. With a few exceptions (Hohmann and Kelley, 1988; Wilcox, 1987b), these pertain to central sites in the Phoenix Basin and in- clude analyses of site layout (Downum, 1993b; Seymour, 1990; Seymour and Schiffer, 1987; Wilcox et al, 1981, 1990), functions associated with pub- lic architecture (Downum, 1993b; Wilcox, 1987c), organization of canal irrigation systems (Neitzel, 1987; Nicholas and Feinman, 1989), burials (Brunson, 1989), and craft production (Seymour, 1988; Wilcox, 1987c). Most large contract projects also foster significant archival research on a variety of topics. Archaeological investigations in the southern deserts of New Mexico and west Texas are comparatively less intensive and less areally concen- trated. The exception is a constellation of cultural resource management studies related to Jornada Mogollón and earlier occupations of Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas (e.g., Scarborough, 1988, 1989; Whalen, 1986, 1990). Surveys to inventory this large military base account for the broadest re- gional coverage (e.g., Carmichael and Gerald, 1986; Whalen, 1987).</page><page sequence="8">10 Fish and Fish Regional sample and reconnaissance surveys (e.g., Ackerly, 1990, 1992; Ackerly et al, 1988; Carmichael, 1990; Human Systems Research, 1989; Lekson, 1989; Ravesloot, 1988a) play a proportionately more prominent role in the recent archaeology of the eastern portion of the SSNM than in Arizona. In keeping with mandated projects covering vast areas contain- ing dispersed, primarily surface remains and few substantial habitation sites, landscape approaches have been developed and implemented (e.g., Camilli, 1988; Camilli et al, 1988; Seaman et al, 1988). The results reveal a complex history of predominantly extractive activities, some of which can be chrono- logically bracketed. The nonprofit Mimbres Foundation sponsored a regional survey and a series of excavations in southwestern New Mexico; an original body of fieldwork and publications was completed by 1987 (Blake et al, 1986; LeBlanc, 1989; Minnis, 1985a). More recent research into Mimbres prehis- tory concerns related issues of settlement pattern (Herrington and Creel, 1991; Lekson, 1989, 1990a; M. Nelson, 1993a, b), settlement structure (Gilman, 1989; Lekson, 1990b; Shafer, 1990; Shafer and Taylor, 1986), so- cial organization (Creel, 1989; Gilman, 1990; Lekson, 1992), and subsistence (Sandor and Gersper, 1988; Sandor et aly 1986; Shafer et al, 1989). As in Arizona, an important component in both Mimbres Founda- tion and later studies has been the reexamination of archival and artifactual materials from earlier excavations at large sites (Anyon and LeBlanc, 1984; Herrington and Creel, 1991; B. Nelson and LeBlanc, 1986; Schaafsma, 1990; Shafer, 1990, 1991a, b). A major thrust of research in Chihuahua consists of an expansion and refinement of the ceramic and cultural sequence as defined by Charles Di Peso (1974) at Casas Grandes. Two long-term programs are directed toward defining the organizational role of Casas Grandes in its region (Minnis, 1989; Minnis and Whalen, 1990) and its relationships to configu- rations farther south (Kelley and Stewart, 1993). Topical studies examine chronology (Braniff, 1986, 1992; Dean and Ravesloot, 1993; Pearson, 1992), specialized production and exchange (Douglas, 1992; Epstein, 1991; Minnis, 1988; Minnis et al, 1993; Olguin, 1991; Pailes, 1990; Woosley and Olinger, 1993), mortuary patterns (Ravesloot, 1988b), settlement organization and hierarchy (Minnis, 1989), agricultural technology (Doolittle, 1993; Schmidt and Gerald, 1988) and warfare (Gerald, 1990; Ravesloot and Spoerl, 1989). A variety of regional syntheses and reports is also available (Brown, 1991; Guevara-Sanchez, 1986, 1992; Marquez-AIameda, 1989, 1992; Ruiz-Funes, 1991). A detailed master sequence for the Sonoran portion of the SSNM has yet to be established. Other than new work at Huatabampo (Alvarez, Í990) ii&gt; southernmost Sonora, recent efforts cluster in the</page><page sequence="9">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 11 northern part of the state. Systematic regional surveys along the Rio Sonora (Doolittle, 1984, 1988) and in the Altar Valley (McGuire and Villalpando C, 1989a) outline occupational sequences and settlement distributions and furnish a basis for preliminary stylistic comparison with the neighboring Hohokam culture sequence. Results from a set of excavations near Caborca, Cucurpe, and Fronteras clarify chronological relationships among stylistic traditions of Chihuahua, Arizona, and Son- ora during the late prehistoric and protohistoric periods (Braniff-C, 1990, 1992). Recent syntheses of Sonoran prehistory feature archae- ological interpretation in light of extensive documentary sources avail- able for the colonial period (Alvarez, 1991; Braniff-C, 1991; Doolittle, 1988; McGuire and Villalpando C, 1989b; Reff, 1991b; Riley, 1987; Villalpando C, 1991). Literature The expenditure of millions of dollars for mandated work in the southwestern United States tends to shape both the kinds of new data and the manner of dissemination. The great majority of all primary research is reported by contractors or agencies in specified, poorly circulating formats. Neither academic libraries nor governmental clearinghouses possess com- plete publications for respective subareas. This problem is exacerbated for southern Arizona, where the pace and scale of contractual investigations have accelerated most rapidly. In recognition of management needs for summary and reference works, governmental agencies commission overviews for various geographical units and, in Arizona, for classes of archaeological remains (Dart, 1989; Doyel, 1993; Slaughter et al, 1992). Overviews for the SSNM include those for regional divisions of agency management and cultural or geographic areas (e.g., Bronitsky and Merritt, 1986; Katz and Katz, 1985; Kirkpatrick and Eldenbach, 1993; Lekson, 1992; Stone, 1986; Whittlesey, 1993). Relatively accessible from agencies or among government publications in libraries, these overviews are particularly useful compilations of unobtainable or poorly circulated reports. The most encompassing summaries are widely available and influential analyses of the archaeology of southwestern Arizona (McGuire and Schiffer, 1982) and New Mexico (Stuart and Gauthier, 1981). With the proliferation of poorly integrated primary data, regional conferences have become increasingly pivotal. They occasion timely summaries, and frequently the ultimate syntheses, for current research. Although proceedings of certain conferences are usually published, the</page><page sequence="10">12 Fish and Fish professional and avocational organizations that assume responsibility do not always possess the resources for rapid or wide dissemination. Published conferences with SSNM cultural divisions or subareas as themes include those for the Hohokam (Dittert and Dove, 1985; Doelle and Fish, 1987), Salado (Lange and Germick, 1992), Mogollón (Beckett, 1991, 1992), Jornada Mogollón (Foster and O'Laughlin, 1985; Laumbach and Eidenbach, 1988; Márquez-Alameda, 1993), and borderlands, with an em- phasis on Chihuahua (Actas del Congreso de Historia Regional Comparada). A commemorative conference on the Gran Chichimeca pertains mainly to the SSNM (Woosley and Ravesloot, 1993). As an outgrowth of the intensity of Hohokam investigations, topical conferences have addressed irrigation (Breternitz, 1991), organization of villages (Doyel, 1987), and subsistence (Gasser and Kwiatkowski, 1991a). A number of comprehensive, article- or chapter-length syntheses for large subareas incorporate both traditional perspectives on culture history and substantial accounts of recent findings. These are available for the Hohokam (Crown, 1990; P. Fish, 1989), Mimbres (LeBlanc, 1989), and northern Mexico (Phillips, 1989a). Efforts to integrate topically the wealth of data on the Hohokam include a scholarly volume (Gumerman, 1991), a popular volume (Noble, 1991), and a comparison with Chaco Canyon (Crown and Judge, 1991). The numbers of archaeologists working in the southwestern United States, the corresponding volume of information, and a traditional attention to details of material culture have resulted in a minimum of internal cross-cultural studies and very rare comparisons outside the Southwest This lack of comparative ori- entation also reflects a disjuncture with predominant paradigms in North American archaeology of the 1970s and 1980s. One general archaeological pre- occupation during these decades has been the evolution of states and highly complex societies, while another coherent body of theory has developed around issues involving hunters and gatherers. Prehistoric societies of the Southwest do not easify conform to either theoretical sphere; the dominant framework con- tinues to be region-specific ethnographic analogy. A counter to particularistic tendencies is provided by conferences en- compassing all culture areas of the Southwest. Such conferences serve to disseminate current syntheses and encourage cross-regional comparisons. An updated set of regional syntheses that shares common themes is the outgrowth of an invited seminar (Cordell and Gumerman, 1989). Other seminar volumes feature topical chapters by multiple authors with varied geographical and disciplinary backgrounds (Gumerman and Gilman, 1992). The Southwest Symposium is a recently organized and ongoing forum for such exchange (Mkinis and Redman, 1990; Wills and Leonard, 1993).</page><page sequence="11">Southern Southwest U.SA, and Northwest Mexico 13 TOPICS AND ISSUES Late Archaic Fanners Excavations at the beginning of the 1950s at Bat Cave in west-central New Mexico yielded the first examples of early Southwestern corn. The apparent age of these materials, incorrectly dated to 5000 years ago, created the impression that limited farming for more than 3000 years had little visible impact on South- western societies (Minnis, 1985b). In a prominent model for the diffusion of agriculture (Haury, 1962), corn was transmitted from the Chihuahuan Sierra Ma- dre to the Mogollón Highlands of New Mexico. Adapted to moist high elevations, corn presumably spread into other parts of the Southwest only later, when varieties with broader ecological tolerance became available. Challenges to Bat Cave chro- nology (Berry, 1982), then reexcavation and upward redating of its corn (Wills, 1988a, b), laid the groundwork for a dramatic réévaluation of the agricultural transition based on new findings throughout the Southwest The largest and most coherent body of information pertaining to Late Archaic farmers in the SSNM comes from the Tucson Basin and adjoining areas to the east in southern Arizona (for summaries see S. Fish et aL, 1990, 1992, pp. 11-19; Huckell, 1990; Wills and Huckell, 1993). In less than 10 years, cultigens have been documented at almost all excavated sites dating between 3000 and 2000 B.P., widely distributed at approximately 15 locations. In well- studied villages characterized by pit structures, deep middens, cemeteries, and diverse artifact assemblages, flotation studies to date show a ubiquity of charred corn resembling that of later Hohokam settlements (Huckell, 1990). Where intensive surveys have been performed, Late Archaic settlement pat- terns also appear to parallel those of ceramic periods. Relatively low desert basins account for the majority of landforms intervening between the southwestern United States and sources of Mesoamerican cultigens to the south. It is difficult to characterize the mode of transmission in the total absence of knowledge about contemporary societies in the Mexican portion of the SSNM. Although long-term manipulation of indigenous species has now been documented among Archaic populations of the eastern United States (Smith, 1989), pre- agricultural subsistence patterns remain virtually unknown in the Southwest. How- ever, previously unanticipated numbers of new sites in southern Arizona echo the relatively abundant evidence and chronology for initial farmers in other intensively studied sectors of the northern Southwest (Matson, 1991; Wills, 1988a, b; Wills and Huckell, 1993) and more fragmentary data elsewhere in the SSNM (Mac- Neish, 1989; Upham et aL, 1986). The majority of the earliest corn in all these locations is described as botanically similar (Adams, 1993; Galinat, 1988; Wills, 1992), suggesting its wide ecological tolerance. The diversity of environments fur- ther implies variety in Late Archaic agricultural techniques.</page><page sequence="12">14 Fish and Fish Late Archaic remains immediately preceding the adoption of Mesoamerican domesticates can seldom be distinguished and have received no thorough study. The economic orientations and patterns of mobility or sedentism for these populations have been interpolated from the more vis- ible record of earliest farmers, in conjunction with regional and cross-cul- tural analogies and general theory (S. Fish and Fish, 1992; S. Fish et al, 1990; Huckell, 1990; Matson, 1991; Wills, 1988a, b, 1992; Wills and Huckell, 1993). Current evidence for village settlements, recovered near Tucson (Huckell, 1990), is approximately as old as the oldest well-replicated dates for Southwestern corn, although a few discoveries of pithouse structures in the eastern SSNM predate the documented entry of cultigens by many cen- turies (e.g., O'Laughlin, 1980). The period between the earliest record of dietary importance for cultigens (ca. 800 B.C.) and the appearance of pottery (A.D. 200 to 300) is almost as long as the ensuing Hohokam and Mogollón sequences. Some groups undoubtedly retained essentially hunting and gath- ering lifestyles during this interval, but it is clear that it is not appropriate to characterize the earliest ceramic phases as agriculturally transitional. The Timing of Early Ceramic Villages A horizon of pithouses with nonpainted brownwares, usually including some red-slipped pottery, may date to as early as 400 B.C. in Sonora (Pailes, 1984), but little else is known from investigations in Mexico. Similar materials occur after A.D, 250 in a variety of settlements in the eastern SSNM within the United States (Fig. 3). Because an equivalent ceramic complex was pre- viously thought to be absent in the Hohokam sphere, an even earlier entry by nonrelated, pottery-making irrigators from Mexico was posited for south- ern Arizona at the beginning of the Vahki phase (erroneously dated to circa 300 B.C.) (Haury, 1976). Additional brownware/redware ceramic sites have now been excavated (e.g., Elson et al, 1992; Lightfoot et al, 1984), including multiple instances within Hohokam territory (Bernard-Shaw, 1990; Cable and Doyel, 1987; P. Fish et al, 1992a; Hackbarth, 1992; Huckell et al, 1987). Ex- cept for a few older outliers, dates for these ceramics preceding Hohokam painted types cluster between the third and the sixth centuries A.D., con- forming with other manifestations of this horizon. As a result of the accelerated activity in Hohokam archaeology, determinations are now sufficient for chronological adjustment of all earlier phases. Challenges to previous placement of this part of the sequence (Plog, 1980; Schiffer, 1982) have been supported by numerous new dates that both compress pre-Classic ceramic phases and move them upward in time (Dean, 1991; Eighmy and McGuire, 1988).

Subscript 1: The Tucson Basin Pioneer period has recently been subdivided into the Tortolita phase (A.D. 450-700), including redware ceramics (Bernard-Shaw, 1990), and an earlier phase with only plainware pottery dating between A.D. 200 and A.D. 450 (Bernard-Shaw, 1990; Huckell et a/., 1987, pp. 293-296). the recognition of an initial brownware/redware horizon, phases with painted pottery within the Pioneer and Colonial divisions now span a shortened interval between about A.D. 500 and A.D. 1000 (Dean, 1991, p. 91, Fig. 3.6).</page><page sequence="14">16 Fish and Fish Subsistence and Agricultural Technology Subsistence information for Late Archaic farmers of the SSNM is inadequate for thoroughly characterizing the role of cultigens in almost every case, although a relatively consistent occurrence of corn has been demonstrated among many site types. In a few instances where more extensive botanical studies have been carried out at villages or other site types, the proportional prominence of maize is clear (e.g., Huckell, 1990). However, substantial analyses of subsistence remains are now available for brownware/redware and early Pioneer period components (Ackerly and Henderson, 1989; Bernard-Shaw, 1988, 1990; Cable et al, 1985; Chenault et al, 1993; P. Fish et al, 1992a; Hackbarth, 1992; Lightfoot et al, 1984). AH commonly encountered cultigens of the northwestern SSNM, and almost all the minor ones, are present in quantities resembling the range for later ceramic periods. For the Hohokam, environmental characteristics of sites and agricultural features of subsequent periods in the same locations suggest the practice of floodwater farming techniques and riverine irrigation on at least a moderate scale by the end of this interval. New information on subsistence remains is limited almost totally to northern sectors of the SSNM. Extensive studies are under way in the Tonto Basin in east-central Arizona (Ciolek-Torrello et al, 1990; Doelle et al, 1992; Rice, 1990), but recently completed studies are concentrated in the central portion of the Hohokam domain. These investigations rep- resent an exponential increase in knowledge over the past decade. Summary papers analyze large bodies of subsistence results in terms of geo- graphic, environmental, and economic patterns (S. Fish, 1988; S. Fish and Nabhan, 1991; Gasser and Kwiatkowski, 1991a, b; Miksicek, 1988; Szuter, 1991a, b). Anthropogenic environments are a topic of current interest. In SSNM studies, this subject includes the nature of occupational modification of the environment and its effect on hunting and gathering strategies (Bohrer, 1992; S. Fish and Fish, 1992; S. Fish and Nabhan, 1991; Szuter and Bayham, 1989). Farming and gathering are not easily separated into mutually exclusive and polar categories in Hohokam subsistence systems. Both ethnographic and archaeological data illustrate a heightened diversity and accessibility of resources in agricultural habitats receiving supplemental water. In the same vein, evidence of intentional manipulation has been advanced for plants such as cholla, little barley, chenopods, and amaranths (see summaries by Bohrer, 1991; S. Fish and Nabhan, 1991; Gasser and</page><page sequence="15">Southern Southwest U.SA, and Northwest Mexico 17 Kwiatkowski, 1991b) that previously would have been classified as exclusively wild resources. The large-scale cultivation of agave is documented at farming locations by a replicated set of agricultural features, processing facilities containing charred agave, and specialized artifacts (S. Fish et al, 1985, 1990). Its primary role in Hohokam subsistence is attested by the abundance of carbonized remains at widespread habitation sites (Gasser and Kwiatkowski, 1991a, b; Miksicek, 1988). Understanding of farming technologies has increased greatly through systematic survey recording, numerous excavations, and spe- cialized studies of agricultural features and fields. The delineation and functioning of riverine canal systems have been investigated in the Mimbres region (Creel and Herrington, 1991), the Tonto Basin (Welch, 1992; Wood et al, 1992), and the Tucson Basin (Bernard- Shaw, 1988), extensively studied in the Phoenix Basin (e.g., Ackerly et al, 1987; Ackerly and Henderson, 1989; Breternitz, 1991; Dart, 1986; Eighmy and Howard, 1991; Howard, 1993; Howard and Huckleberry, 1991; Landis, 1988; Masse, 1987; Niais and Gregory, 1989), and reassessed for Casas Grandes (Doolittle, 1993). An impor- tant innovation among these studies is the reconstruction of stream- flow through dendrochronological analyses in watershed areas for the Salt and Gila rivers (Graybill, 1989), permitting correlation with irri- gation potential and cultural trends over time (e.g., Masse, 1991; Niais et al, 1989). The temporal progression and maximum extent of Phoe- nix Basin systems and the implications for construction, maintenance, and coordination are now better understood but remain topics of de- bate (e.g., Ackerly, 1988; Ackerly and Henderson, 1989; Breternitz, 1991; Howard, 1993; Nicholas and Feinman, 1989). The proliferation of agricultural studies encompasses varied locations across the northern SSNM and a multiplicity of settings and feature types supplied by surface runoff and the floodwaters of secondary drainages. Recent publications describe technical aspects of individual farming methods, and the kinds of technologies and their environmental correlates in particular study areas (e.g., Creel and Herrington, 1991; S. Fish et al, 1992; Minnis and Whalen, 1992; Rankin and Katzer, 1989; Sandor et al, 1986; Sandor and Gersper, 1988; Schmidt and Gerald, 1988; Waters, 1988, 1991; Waters and Field, 1986). Discussions of the layout of sociopolitical and territorial units in the Hohokam area and the Tonto Basin describe mixes of irrigation and nonirrigation technologies, zonation of productive activities, and correlations with other elements of settlement pattern (e.g., Crown, 1987; S. Fish et al, 1992; Howard, 1987; Masse, 1991; Mitchell, 1988a; Rice, 1990).</page><page sequence="16">18 Fish and Fish Stability, Sedentism, and Mobility Archaeologists in the southern SSNM are active participants in a worldwide réévaluation of settlement duration and stability for hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists (e.g., Carmichael, 1990; Gilman, 1987; Hard and Merrill, 1992; Lekson, 1990a, 1992; B. Nelson, 1990; B. Nelson and LeBlanc, 1986; M. Nelson, 1990; Whalen and Gilman, 1990). In the eastern portion of the SSNM, limited occupation spans for even the largest settlements seem to be a common pattern. Such occupations are marked by very little trash and little remodeling or superpositioning of rooms. These sites are of short duration and they often occur at low overall densities (B. Nelson, 1990; p. 158). This phenomenon is pronounced during the late prehistoric period when aggregation is greatest and has been labeled "short-term sedentism" (Nelson and LeBlanc, 1986). Models of short-term sedentism suggest that the sites were formed by inhabitants who moved frequently or who oscillated between agricultural and hunting and gathering modes of subsistence (Carmichael, 1990; Stuart and Gauthier, 1981; Upham, 1992). By reference to worldwide or regional ethnographic analogs, some archaeologists emphasize residential mobility in the form of a seasonal round for pithouse (Diehl, 1992; Gilman, 1987) and even pueblo dwellers (Lekson, 1992). In contrast to these eastern patterns, the remarkable stability of Hohokam occupations at particular locations has long been recognized as unique among traditions of the southwestern United States (e.g., Doyel, 1980; Haury, 1976). Furthermore, continuity in large village lay- outs involving arrangements of houses, trash mounds, and public archi- tecture around central plazas was maintained over hundreds of years (Henderson, 1987; Wilcox et aL, 1981, 1990). Although locational continuity is often attributed to the topographic imperatives of canals and heavy in- vestment in irrigation infrastructure in the Phoenix Basin, there are numerous instances of similarly long-lived settlement in areas away from the Salt and Gila rivers. In these other areas, settlement stability appears to be related to localized water sources along intermittent and ephemeral drainages and the annual renewal of field fertility by nutrients in floodwaters. Settlements along stretches of rivers most favorable for irrigation agriculture sometimes exhibit durations approaching the stability of long-term Phoenix Basin sites (e.g., Kelly, 1978; Lange and Deaver, 1989; Ravesloot, 1987). Restricted loca- tional opportunities and incremental improvements for large-scale floodwater farming also resulted in continuous occupations of zones with active alluvial fans (S. Fish et aL, 1992).</page><page sequence="17">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 19 It is increasingly apparent in regional studies that patterns of sedentism and mobility were not uniform and cannot be exclusively correlated with dis- crete categories of economic orientation (Hard and Merrill, 1992). Small, specialized, and presumably seasonal sites become increasingly visible in con- junction with aggregated settlement in the SSNM (Carmichael, 1990; S. Fish et aL, 1992; Nelson and LeBlanc, 1986, p. 250). Variety in patterns of resi- dential stability and mobility within even a single late prehistoric community of interrelated settlements may have been the norm, with differences among households and individuals occasioned by factors such as specializations in hunting, gathering, and raw material acquisition or the seasonal labor require- ments of intensive agriculture (S. Fish et aL, 1990, p. 90). Community Organization Recent years have witnessed the rise to prominence of what might be termed a modular perspective in the Hohokam domain and in other SSNM subareas to some extent. The focal module or unit of this perspective is the community, defined as a central site with public architecture and an integrated set of surrounding settlements. This concept of a community as a territorial and sociopolitical entity has broader usage in Southwestern archaeology (e.g., Lekson, 1991; Rohn, 1989), but the current wealth of Hohokam data permits detailed synchronous examinations and close monitoring of developmental trends. Several tiers of social components have been defined below the community level; multicommunity aggregates and even more inclusive modules have been considered above it. The presence of large structures and plazas at several sites and a low mound at Snaketown mark differentiated communal precincts in the earliest Hohokam phases (Bernard-Shaw, 1990; Cable and Doyel, 1987; Wilcox et al, 1981). However, it is only after A.D. 900, when widely recorded ballcourts identify distributions of central sites, that the general shape and spacing of Hohokam communities can be inferred (Wilcox and Sternberg, 1983). In the Classic period after A.D. 1150, platform mounds replace ballcourts as public edifices in the central sector of the Hohokam tradition and are constructed as far east as the San Pedro River and the Tonto Basin. Much progress has been made in delineating the archaeological com- ponents of communities and interpreting their social correlates during the past decade (P. Fish and Fish, 1991). A set of two to six structures forming a courtyard group has been equated with a household in the economic sense and with the basic residential unit in kinship structure (e.g., Doelle</page><page sequence="18">20 Fish and Fish et al, 1987; Henderson, 1987; Howard, 1985; Wilcox et aLy 1981). Multiples of courtyard groups, often correlated with a lineage, appear to share fa- cilities such as pit ovens, cemeteries, and trash mounds (e.g., Henderson, 1987; Rice, 1987a; Wilcox, 1987b). Courtyards and their larger groupings are the building blocks of smaller and larger sites respectively. Continuity is now seen in these kinds of settlement components between pre-Classic villages with pithouses and Classic period villages with adobe rooms and compounds (Sires, 1987). As defined previously, the idealized community contains a central site with public architecture as the integrative node for surrounding settlements. Multivillage subunits below the community level may be indicated by hier- archy among sites in a completely surveyed Tucson community of the Classic period (S. Fish et aly 1992). Adobe compounds, the most elaborate form of residential architecture, are confined to the mound center and the three other largest sites. It is difficult to evaluate the presence of similarly defined or equivalent subunits where community coverage and knowledge of settlement types are incomplete and where modern urban and agricul- tural disturbance are pervasive. Entities that encompass more than one Hohokam central site and its hinterland settlements have been proposed on several bases. In the pre-Classic era of ballcourt centers, a vertical series would consist of sites without ballcourts, sites with at least one small ballcourt, and sites with one large and often one or more small ballcourts (Wilcox, 1991c, p. 262). In both pre-Classic and Classic times, a compelling association can be posited among multiple communities with separate centers that share a common irrigation network in the Phoenix Basin. In fact, a seminal defi- nition of the Hohokam irrigation community includes all centers and their surrounding settlements along the same line (Doyel, 1974, 1980). A degree of preeminence has been attributed to positions for centers at both the beginning and the end of a common canal and to those centers exhibiting greater site size and investment in public architecture (e.g., Crown, 1987; Gregory, 1991; Gregory and Niais, 1985; Howard, 1987; Wilcox, 1991a, c). Still more inclusive groupings of Hohokam communities have been posited. An ideology embodied in ballcourts, the coordination of ballcourt observances, and secondary interactions occasioned by ballcourt events united the pre-Classic Hohokam into what has been termed a regional system (Wilcox, 1991c; Wilcox and Sternberg, 1983). Several alliances of communities in outlying subareas are proposed in response to the domi- nance of the Phoenix Basin within this regional system. These alliances emerge strongly with the collapse of the system and cessation of ballcourt use. Clusterings of- subsequent Classic period mound communities in the</page><page sequence="19">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 21 Phoenix Basin and other subareas reflect competition and conflict accord- ing to this scenario. Stylistic divisions, depopulated buffer zones, and ethnic recombinations accompany these rearrangements (Doelle and Wallace, 1991; McGuire, 1991; Wilcox, 1991c). Broader interlinkages of the Classic period, including the Salado phenomenon, are conceptualized as weakly integrated interaction spheres involving ties such as elite exchange and in- termarriage (McGuire, 1991; Wilcox, 1987c). The widely distributed Mimbres complex of ceramics, architectural styles, and settlement organization is sometimes conceptualized as an in- teraction sphere or regional system resembling that of the pre-Classic Hohokam (Lekson, 1990b, 1992; Upham, 1992; Wilcox, 1991c). The Mimbres Valley is often considered the significant core for these cultural configurations, perhaps even more strongly than is the Phoenix Basin for the Hohokam. However, during the eleventh and early twelfth centuries, sites of Mimbres affiliation occur from the upper Gila to the Rio Grande and include some of the largest sites in the SSNM during this time period (Lekson, 1990a, 1992). Great kivas and plazas after A.D. 500 at Mimbres settlements (LeBlanc, 1989, p. 182) and the Convento Site near Casas Grandes (DiPeso, 1974) may embody integrative functions similar to those of generally contemporary southern Arizona ballcourts. After A.D. 1100, these Mimbres forms disappear along with Hohokam ballcourts. Developments in the Late Prehistoric Period In the twelfth century, community organization can be recognized in an expanded area bordering the central Hohokam domain through the presence and spacing of mound centers in the Tonto Basin (Craig et al, 1992; Lindauer, 1992; Wood et al, 1992) and in Papagueria west of Tucson (Dart et al, 1990). These locales lack ballcourts as indicators of centers for earlier community units. In the years between A.D. 1300 and A.D. 1450, however, settlement configurations consistent with community organization can be identified most widely in the SSNM. Figure 4 shows the distribution of platform mounds, trincheras sites, and Casas Grandes-style ballcourts. Distributions of each of these elements require qualification with regard to organizational interpretation. Some of the southern Arizona mound centers were abandoned near the beginning of this late prehistoric period, indicating a shift in integrative structure. In particular cases, it can be shown that settlement was also trun- cated in the surrounding community (Craig et al, 1992; Downum, 1993a; S. Fish and Fish, 1993). This trend is accompanied by (1) increased popu- lation densities in centers and communities with the greatest irrigation</page><page sequence="20">22 Fish and Fish potential (e.g., P. Fish et al, 1993); (2) an increase in primacy among cen- ters as indicated by the greater size and the diversity and elaboration of public architecture at a few sites (e.g., Downum, 1993b; Minnis, 1989; Wil- cox, 1991c); and (3) the replacement of more localized styles of decorated ceramics and architecture with the previously discussed panregional poly- chromes and adobe buildings. A greater concentration and proximity of geographically and culturally disparate populations is an outgrowth of these developments, with implications for organizational and stylistic adjustments to aggregation and heterogeneity. Most trincheras sites are hillside villages with terracing and other ma- sonry structures. The equation of such settlements with community centers must be qualified to exclude instances in which this designation has been extended to sites consisting of only a few masonry features. Recent inves- tigations and reanalyses underscore substantial resident population and public architecture at trincheras sites in southern Arizona and northwest Mexico between A.D. 1150 and A.D. 1450 (Braniff C, 1992; Downum, 1993a; Downum et ai, 1994; McGuire and Villalpando G, 1989a, personal communication). Trincheras settlements of this sort occur in addition to mound centers in some communities of the Tucson Basin but appear to be the exclusive sites with communal edifices throughout the Sonoran dis- tribution. Furthermore, the spacing of trincheras sites along major drainages resembles that of mound centers (Fig. 4). The distribution of Casas Grandes-style ballcourts after A.D. 1300 is more difficult to link with community organization. Morphological variability in court-like features is poorly documented or understood. A regional recon- naissance survey (Minnis and Whalen, 1992) greatly expands knowledge about settlement and ballcourt locations around Casas Grandes and to the north. Ballcourts are spaced at intervals near Casas Grandes and occur at relatively large sites in irrigable zones. Features identified as ballcourt outliers in New Mexico and Sonora (Carpenter, 1992; Doolittle, 1988) seem to be isolated, and settlement data are too fragmentary to evaluate the possibility of inter- vening instances. The Sonoran sites with Casas Grandes ballcourts are interpreted as centers for surrounding communities on the basis of survey along the Rio Sonora (Doolittle, 1988). Casas Grandes is strongly differentiated from other ballcourt sites by the diversity and elaboration of public architecture, including 18 mounds of varied type. The primacy of Casas Grandes with regard to broadly surrounding settlement (Minnis, 1989) is maximal for late prehistoric centers in the SSNM. However, the strongest expressions of primate centers in other regions are generally contemporary, such as Las Trincheras in Sonora and Casa Grande, Mesa Grande, and Pueblo Grande in southern Arizona.</page><page sequence="21">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 23 ^ - v_ y ' %- Y l^-i // z. o o o r^ w I c S .a SI 2 c j? 3 •o s co x: &lt;j c ii vT w tí &gt;% q = = ^ ss öS 2 ü Õ vT •o c 3 O E e I .2 a. *o e ,o 3 5 "^ JOB</page><page sequence="22">24 Fish and Fish Where coverage is sufficient to evaluate SSNM settlement trends reliably, simultaneous contraction and aggregation are evident in late prehistory (e.g., Doolittle, 1988; P. Fish et al, 1993; Nelson, 1993a, b; Whittlesey and Ciolek-Torrello, 1992). Population is lost from less agriculturally productive areas, while aggregation correlates largely with irrigable floodplains of major rivers and other settings with potential for productive intensification. Frequency of interaction and occasions neces- sitating cooperation must have increased among individuals and groups of diverse origin in these situations. Expanded hierarchy, institutions cross-cutting social constituencies, and ideologies promoting commonality are among the possible and probable resolutions under aggregated conditions. WRAPPING IT UP: COMPLEXITY AT ISSUE Appropriate characterization of social and organizational complexity is the subject of extended discourse and controversy in SSNM archaeology. It is a primary topic in virtually every high-level subareal synthesis and in cross-regional comparisons. Debates pertaining to complexity in the SSNM reflect oppositions that have preoccupied Southwestern archaeologists in recent years (e.g., Cordell and Plog, 1979; Cordell and Upham, 1989; Reid and Whittlesey, 1990), but a similarly heated interchange animates the archaeology of the eastern United States (see Barker and Pauketat, 1992). These controversies can be seen as the outcome of an inherent conflict in North American archaeology between those espousing close adherence to ethnographic analogues and those employing conceptual schemes designed to explicate developmental trajectories ending in states or sociopolitical relationships of the modern world (e.g., Marxism, world systems theory). Aside from developments related to Chaco Canyon, most regional archaeologists ascribe greater complexity to manifestations in the SSNM than to those in the area north of the Mogollón Rim. Casas Grandes in Chihuahua is usually cited as foremost, due partly to Charles Di Peso's (1974) interpretation in terms of a Mesoamerican outpost. A linkage with Tula in central Mexico is not supported by a reassessment of chronology (Dean and Ravesloot, 1993). Economic centralization at Casas Grandes (Minnis, 1989) and the strength of regional hegemony (Douglas, 1992; Minnis and Whalen, 1992) are also being questioned in new research and reanalysis. "Statelets" in northern Sonora, in some cases viewed as outgrowths of Casas Grandes contact, are inferred primarily on the basis</page><page sequence="23">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 25 of early Spanish descriptions of indigenous polities (Braniff C, 1992; Doolittle, 1988; Pailes, 1990; Riley, 1987). The significance of Sonoran archaeological remains with regard to complexity is less widely acknow- ledged than for Casas Grandes, and has recently been challenged (e.g., McGuire and Villalpando C, 1989a; Sheridan, 1992). In the southwestern United States, the Classic period Hohokam, and particularly those of the Phoenix Basin, are usually considered among the foremost examples of complexity and hierarchy. Attributes contributing to this perception include dense and permanent populations, the construction of the largest prehistoric canal systems north of Peru (Doolittle, 1990), and the erection of relatively massive public architecture. No other Hohokam sector is a rival for the Phoenix Basin in these realms, but new perceptions of the magnitude of population, public architecture, and integrative struc- ture in surrounding areas are underscored by recent research (e.g., Dart et al, 1990; S. Fish et al, 1992; Lange and Germick, 1992; Redman et al, 1992). No one denies the necessity for cooperation and coordination in the construction and use of canals longer than 15 m. However, conclusions con- cerning levels of effort, interconnections between canal systems, the need for centralized control, and the relationship of networks to political entities are hardly matters of consensus (e.g., Ackerly, 1988; Breternitz, 1991; Gregory, 1991; Howard, 1992; Masse, 1991; Nicholas and Feinman, 1989). Wittfogel's (1957) hypothesis about hydraulic civilizations is unlikely to be resolved among Hohokam archaeologists in the near-future. Another arena of activity implicated in complexity is the conduct of warfare. Although conflict has been invoked as a primary determinant of the clustered configuration of late prehistoric Hohokam settlement (Doelle and Wallace, 1991; Wilcox, 1991c), archaeological evidence for military iconography, personnel, or organization has yet to be identified. Centralization and organization in the economic sphere and multisite in- terconnections are also being evaluated in studies of production, con- sumption, and exchange (e.g., Abbott and Schaller, 1992; Bayman, 1992; Crown, 1991; Doyel, 1991; P. Fish et al, 1992a; S. Fish and Donaldson, 1991; Simon et al, 1992). The functions associated with central sites and with public or cere- monial precincts are key factors in assessing hierarchy and complexity. Communal storage, food preparation for feasts, observance of rituals, as- tronomy and calendrics, craft production and stockpiling, and differentiated residence are cited in recent studies (Bostwick, 1992; Downum, 1993b; P. Fish et al, 1992b; Howard, 1992; Jacobs, 1992; Lindaeur, 1992; Wilcox, 1987a, 1991b, c).-</page><page sequence="24">26 Fish and Fish Although residential functions have been ascribed to certain rooms on Hohokam and Tonto Basin platform mounds of the later Classic period (Downum, 1993b; Gregory, 1991; Lindauer, 1992; Wilcox, 1987c), other correlates of leadership personnel and status have proved elusive. Quantitative and qualitative differences in high value items are documented between centers and other sites (Bayman, 1992; Howard, 1987; Teague, 1984) but have not proved definitive in discriminating the residences of privileged social groups from other habitation structures. Among the Hohokam and throughout the SSNM, mortuary studies show patterned differences in accompaniments and burial treatment and placement (Creel, 1989; Gilman, 1990; McGuire, 1992; Mitchell, 1991, 1992; Ravesloot, 1988b), Nevertheless, the sumptuous- ness of the burial assemblage does not anywhere seem to have been the means by which elevated classes or paramount leaders were dramatically or unequivocally distinguished. Documentary sources are available for a comparatively early period of colonial observation in the Mexican portion of the SSNM. Archaeologists from both the United States and Mexico who study this segment often interpret historic analogies for complexity with wide latitude. In the northern portion of the SSNM, later historic records and ethnographic patterns exhibit little connection with archaeological expressions that are most suggestive of com- plexity such as large centers and public architecture. Archaeologists who perceive a minimum of complexity in the archaeological record tend to invoke analogies with relatively late successor groups in the southern deserts and with Puebloan peoples of the northern Southwest. These scholars find themselves at odds with colleagues who believe that the archaeological remains signify a disjunct level of complexity and hierarchy and who, therefore, seek models from more far-ranging sources. The intersection of indigenous SSNM cultural developments with events set in motion by the Spanish entrada represents a period and a proc- ess that have been little clarified by recent archaeological investigations. The latter part of the Casas Grandes sequence (Braniff C, 1992; Dean and Ravesloot, 1993), the interval of Salado polychromes (Reid and Whittlesey, 1992), and dates for the latest Hohokam occupations (Dean, 1991; Henderson and Martynec, 1992) have all been adjusted significantly upward, but archaeological information is inadequate to delineate cultural configurations of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The chronology and nature of terminal occupations at large, populous, and preeminent cen- ters are virtually unknown. Late, complex social systems apparently persisted longer than previously accepted end points. The relationship of their final demise to contact factors remains a critical and controversial question (e.g., McGuire and Villalpando C, 1989a; Reff, 1990, 1991a, b; Sheridan, 1992; Wilcox, 1990).</page><page sequence="25">Southern Southwest U.S.A. and Northwest Mexico 27 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Neal W.
