It contributes to the element of self-subversion in her Monna Innominata and to the apparatus of repetition by which such subversion is in significant part enacted. Rossetti's sequence of fourteen sonnets swerves, as early as sonnet 5, away from its stated purpose of self-expression toward a conventional religious resolution. The purpose stated at the poem's outset is to give a voice to the previously silent and "unnamed lady" of the courtly love tradition, and the poem goes some distance toward both such expression and the undermining of this particular tradition. Recent critics have attempted to extend these aspects of the sonnets to recuperative readings of Rossetti's retreat into religion. William Whitla, for example, represents Rossetti's retreat as a deliberate but defensible move against self-disclosure (to the Sylvan Esh, a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is examining ways RomanJakobson's poetics may be used to explicate Victorian, modernist, and contemporary texts of poetry.

Finally, however, in place of disclosure one finds only constant deferral, the primary objective of which seems to be the production of a rationale for general renunciation. Ultimately, it is Rossetti's use of repetition that discloses the nature of the repressions operative in these deferrals. Religious material is diffused throughout much of Rossetti's work, intermixed even with the poems that fall outside the group of more than 450 usually categorized as belonging to her body of devotional poetry. In many cases, as Ralph Bellas and others argue, the mixed poems remain strong by current aesthetic standards, figured as they are by intense personal reflection and emotion. It is illuminating to note, however, that two points Bellas makes regarding the body of religious work also pertain directly to Monna Innominata, even though Bellas and others would have it that the latter stands clear of such underminings. The first point involves the three-fold theme that includes "the vanity of all earthly things, the anticipation of an early death, and the looking forward to heaven."2 The second is the feature of Rossetti's devotional poems that "frequently express[es] a wavering faith that [leads] to an agonizing sense of unworthiness and even [of] alienation from God."3 These, clearly, are the kinds of emotion and the kind of vacillation at the heart of Monna Innominata. The first appearance of this wavering between desire and postponement-figured, significantly, as earthly and heavenly happiness, respectively-appears in the opening sonnet: Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:- Or come not yet, for it is over then, And long it is before you come again, So far between my pleasures are and few. While, when you come not, what I do I do Thinking "Now when he comes," my sweetest "when": For one man is my world of all the men This wide world holds; 0 love, my world is you. Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang Because the pang of parting comes so soon; My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon Between the heavenly days on which we meet: Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang When life was sweet because you called them sweet?4 Monna Innominata is to be distinguished from other parts of Rossetti's work that fall more completely outside this sphere of 836</page><page sequence="3">SYLVAN ESH influence. "Goblin Market," for example, some of the "songs," and a significant number of poems adopting freer formal structures have a vitality rarely if ever met with in her "serious" work. Ruskin was perhaps never so wrong as when, sending to Michael Rossetti his assessment of the "offences" of "Goblin Market," he wrote that "Irregular measure (introduced to my great reglret, in its chief wilfulness, by Coleridge) is the calamity of modern poetry... [Y]our sister should exercise herself in the severest commonplace of metre until she can write as the public like. . . . [S]he must have the Form first."5 It is precisely in poems where Rossetti embraces the "Form" that restrictions multiply counterproductively. Witness the proliferation of repetition in sonnet 1 of Monna Innominata, which continues unabated throughout the following sonnets. The repressions that underlie such repetitions have cultural as well as psychological bases, and they are, in addition, linked to the restrictions of specific formal conventions-in Rossetti, of the sonnet, the pentameter, and the courtly love tradition. The prevalence of repetition in Monna Innomninata makes it conspicuous as a central strategy, and so suggests it as a point of investigation. Two opposing functions of repetition have been formulated by Roman Jakobson. The first of these is active, metaphorical repetition, in which lexical, structural, and other kinds of repetitions introduce analogies of a mixed order, both analogical and ironic; the second depends more completely on strict repetition without significant levels of irony, and therefore tends to figure metonymically. The latter is sometimes identified with repression, according to Jakobson, and it is the latter that predominates in Monna Innominata. The poem's dense structuring of strict repetitions and, on the other hand, its almost complete avoidance of metaphor in the normal, tropic sense, make it an interesting example of the condition Jakobson links to the clinical speech disability of aphasia. Though superficially distinct from Jakobson's example of Uspenski's "disintegrated portraits,"6 Monna Innominata may also, by virtue of its reliance on the metonymic principle, be viewed as the sign of an imaginative failure of either the poet or the broader, national or cultural body that is the writer's context. In Rossetti, in particular, the mode is marked by a significant avoidance of both expressive and structural features typical of metaphor, including the transformative and declarative moments in which crucial linkages and identifications might be made, and the counter tendency prevails by default. 837</page><page sequence="4">MONNA INNOMINATA ForJakobson, metaphor and metonymy are the principles basic to the production of language. While the metaphorical principle, for example, is engaged in the instance of the isolated trope, it is far more essential as the basis of meaningful parallels-lexical, contextual, structural, or grammatical-the totality of which constructs a system or "grammar" of parallels that produce, in Baudelaire's phrase, the poem's "evocative sorcery."7 The balanced interaction of the two principles brings logically unrelated elements into suggestive interrelation. In Coleridge's line picturing an icicle "[q]uietly shining to the quiet moon" ("Frost at Midnight," line 74), for example, repetition highlights-that is, produces, by way of the vertical, paradigmatic axis, an intriguing analogy from along the syntagmatic chain. The beauty of this equation is due not merely to the repetition of quiet per se, but by the unexpected symmetries it identifies between the objects modified. This double set of images, icicles and moon, serves as the basis for further, shifting asymmetries-for example, belonging to or suggested by the moon: cold/warmth, cold/stillness, image/infinity, darkness/ clarity, transparence/substance, desolation/security. Jakobson himself identifies this same principle in the syntactic and morphological units of the lines "Not a bright falcon was flying beyond the hills, / Not a fierce horse was coming at a gallop to the court."8 Metaphorical repetition of these varieties makes possible the equation of otherwise dissimilar units, thereby establishing complexities of meaning whose specific instances reinforce, complicate, or otherwise intensify relations that exist within the work. "Goblin Market," Rossetti's great counterexample to the restrictions of Monna Innorninata, has deservedly received a greater degree of attention and suggests by contrast the crucial elements missing in the latter poem. The first of these is its open form, which establishes the grounds for further liberties. The most important are undoubtedly its richly varied and suggestive vocabulary and its ready access to metaphor. Like Monna Innominata and poetry generally, it makes use of repetition, but in conjunction with significant linguistic events. In his essay on "Goblin Market," Steven Connor identifies and discusses a number of the more conventional effects of repetition in the poem.9 Chief among these are irony and cohesion, achieved by exact or near repetition. As an example of both, Connor considers the fluctuation of sound and sense in Rossetti's grouping of flag, which appears first as the name of a flower, then as the banner of "flying armies," and finally, as a failing ("flagging") of breath. Repetition here is cohesive, obviously, but it also brings various 838</page><page sequence="5">S Y LV AN E S H logically unrelated elements-sometimes with opposed con- notations-into productive interaction. Connor also observes that three primary, related effects are notable as the results of repetition: linguistic self-reflexiveness or irresolution, the paradoxical capacity of repetition to keep "awareness alive of otherness and alteration," and the ability to produce a shift in the object from particular to general value.'10 One might add that the last of these becomes incantation when intensified, in that it continues the progress from the particular to the general to such an extreme as to empty the signifier of virtually all significance whatever. In such a case the repetition of an image (actually the constant reappearance of nearly similar, increasingly generalized or reduced images, since with each reappearance the experience of perception changes) serves to disintegrate the original image as the original meaning is gradually suspended by a predominance of rhythm and sound. These same effects of repetition are present in Monna Innominata. In its most general effect of cohesion, repetition is certainly present; so is its effect of self-reflexion (for the terms repeated). Taken to its extreme, the latter effect begins by its excessive presence to call into question the actual existence of the objects named by these terms. If either of these two effects, self- reflexion or noncredibility, is inadvertent, the poem is in all likelihood rudderless; if deliberately and artfully manipulated, the effects may be developed in such a way as to question the significance or existence of certain objects of belief, such as love, God, or faithfulness, in general or in specific cases. To some extent the latter is true of Monna Innominata: it ventures ever further into various states of doubt (more so than its explicit statements would allow) as its ghostly sense of the absent other is developed by its incessant repetition. As things move constantly away from the particular toward increasingly vague, generalized objects, its tone becomes increasingly dismal. The related result of this movement is heightened self-attentiveness on the part of the speaker with regard to her condition, a state that passes gradually over into perpetually tentative, strained speech. The aesthetic question to which these considerations must finally be referred concerns how, in formal terms, the poem consummates or undermines its project of giving the unnamed lady of the courtly love tradition an opportunity to speak. Or, on another level, how does it fulfill its textual and subtextual projects of expressing the loss experienced by the monna, and the loss of another, deeper, unnamed loss? Or, related to this, how effectually does this poem undermine existing conventions and genres? To 839</page><page sequence="6">MONNA INNOMINA TA the extent that the poem communicates the weariness of its speaker, it fulfills its project of evoking the sense of loss its speaker feels, and to this extent, also, it calls into question the genre of courtly love poetry that is, after the sonnet, its primary formal reference. When the repetitions proliferate so extensively as to fatigue and alienate the reader, however, they limit inquiry into the nature of these losses. Not only is resolution denied, but, in addition, the complex of repetitions constlructs/lreinforces a position of resignation in the wake of repeated futile efforts (or underlying unwillingness and/or inability) to advance an aggressive investigation of the situation. The sonnet form as such contributes significantly to the obsessive repetition of Monna Innominata.'1 Its formal restrictions entrench repetition, reinforcing and aggravating those cultural and personal restrictions that Rossetti brings to the work. Fundamentally, as a "sonnet of sonnets," the poem functions as a series of openings and closings, and each sonnet contains, in addition, embedded turnings (at the volta, but also at the beginning and end of each of the fourteen sonnets). Each sonnet also features double epigraphs. The voltas, as Whitla and others have noticed, lead to inconclusive endings, and that inconclusiveness is picked up by each subsequent sonnet only to be led, once again, to further inconclusiveness. Whereas the volta of Rossetti's "sonnet" ought to, and superficially does, occur in sonnet 9, furthermore, an earlier, more crucial turn takes place in sonnet 5, at the point where the speaker, as Bellas observes, "commends her lover to God . . . thus introducing into the relationship a new consideration."'2 It is at this point that the poem's declared purpose of giving the long-silenced courtly lover's lady a voice is derailed, establishing irremediably the poem's shift toward endless, futile repetition and finally resignation. This is not to say that repetition in Monnra Innominata is not frequently productive, and it may be illuminating to consider both varieties. Sonnet 9, for example, includes an example of one of the effects described by Connor, albeit a curious, superficially reversed example. This is the situation in which repetition leads from the particular to the general (or, as I have suggested, to a virtual vacuum of meaning), but in this case the linguistic unit in question, the suffix -less, which is negative in the first place, gains rather than loses in meaning. Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall. And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite, Because not loveless. (sonnet 9, lines 8-10) 840</page><page sequence="7">S Y L V AN E S H Repetition increases rather than decreases the literal significance of the suffix -less, for two reasons. First, the suffix is dependent upon nouns that do vary, and second (and more importantly), the disintegration normally effected by repetition increases rather than negates the intensity of this signifier, given its beginning value of negation. Here, in particular, an overwhelming effect of absence and hopelessness is achieved, to the extent that it overcomes the willed optimism of the speaker and thus advances the subtext of absolute loss. Repetition of this kind abounds in Monna Innominata, to varied effect. Simple ambivalence is the result in "Come back to me: . . . / Or come not yet" (sonnet 1, line 2), an intricate patterning of irony in "I dream of you, to wake: would that I mighlt / Dream of you and not wake but slumber on" (sonnet 3, lines 1-2), and a projection of time figured as blurred movement in "As summer ended, Summer birds take flight" (sonnet 3, line 4)* Sonnet 1 is particularly revealing in this respect. Here, with productive results, the sense of potential fulfillment is undercut by the numbing repetition in the octave of the word come, which appears in five of the first six lines. Repetition generative of doubt (regarding the diminishing chances of an actual meeting) unites with repetition as the evocation of the Other, since the Other here is absence. Doubt overwhelms even the assertions recalled in the final line, where the word come does not appear. The poem is structured by a series of repetitions: repetitions of come give way to repetitions- not including end rhymes-of do, when, nan/men, world, you, pang -ing} song and sweet, which constitute in effect so many variations on come. The sense of vacillation these repetitions evoke seduces by suggesting alternatives, and the suggestion prevails in this opening sonnet where promise has not yet passed over into resignation. The interactive complexity repetition introduces in this opening poem is highly effective: hangs, as variation rather than simple repetition, increases the effect of pang, and the interweaving of various other near repetitions with this (waning; waxing, for example) is impressive, especially because such interweaving is accompanied by an intricate syntax and a relatively developed dramatic situation. The result is a sense of completeness not typical of the sequence. Even this sonnet turns, at the close, to conventional imagery, but on the whole the weariness and the pain experienced by the reader are artistically evoked and sustained by sonic and rhythmic patternings. In the sonnets that follow, on the other hand, the variety and interaction of poetic and dramatic elements diminish. At this point, not an evocation of weariness 841</page><page sequence="8">MONNA INNOMINA TA but a readerly weariness sets in. The tedium of the latter is the result in part of a lack of dramatic or metaphysical direction: repetition seems at times to occur simply as the compensatory measure for the absence of a rhythmic, lexical, dramatic, or philosophical complexity. This is the case in the closing lines of sonnet 8, where repetition and the pentameter confuse and deplete rather than promote the intended note of optimism: And for my love to Love put up my prayer, And for love's sake by Love be granted it! Repetition here occurs in excess. Although, on the one hand, the lines attempt a testing of standard conceptualizations of love, this attempt is left unrealized because of the failure on the part of the poet to provide a catalyst or a sharper focus. Because this did not occur, another reading must be attempted. Thus, critics such as Whitla and Delores Rosenblum maintain that the purpose here is the "development" from an earthly to a divine focus. In any case, the term's abstract quality, almost converted by a swerve toward anthropomorphism, remains largely devoid of meaning because the movement toward metaphor is not completed. One could imagine that, with the addition of a single note, these lines might have brought into relief a mythologically inflected image of love, for instance, or an idealization of love of the kind found in Dante, or a modernist questioning of these resolutions. Even more, the sonnet might have developed a questioning of divinity or of the capacity of language. Because the poet avoids bringing the matter to any such revelatory turning, however (in part because metaphorical or transformational movements have been virtually precluded), the lines achieve only limited effects: they figure only ambiguity and-the result of a complex tautology-silence. Sonnet 6 presents a deeper sense of loss more precisely, but also remains general. Again we find balancing oppositions, again reversed, and once again with the effect of irresolution; here, also, we draw nearer to the alternative of an inarticulate religious center: I cannot love you if I love not Him, I cannot love Him if I love not you. Rossetti's use of repetition is most dramatically productive when it affects a deliberately self-reflexive action. In these cases, Rossetti suggests her suspicion of the ungrounded nature of language. This occurs most completely in the sonnets just cited (6 and 8), 842</page><page sequence="9">SYLVAN ESH where her repetitions stylistically resemble those of Swinburne (a good friend of Rossetti's, despite his pagan sensibility). Consistently, however, she hesitates; she does not, as Swinburne clearly does, push the experiment into increasing linguistic complexity. In the following lines from Swinburne, for example, the boundaries of the normal and of the truly horrible dissolve and language threatens to slip its moorings, with the experience delivered through a syntax of asymmetrical repetitions communicating the horror: Saw with strange eyes and with strange lips rejoiced, Seeing these mine own slain of mine own, and me made miserable above all miseries made.'3 Repetition of this complexity works in part because of the urgency the reader feels to disentangle the grammatical complexity. Complexity of this sort is the kind one finds in one of the epigraphs from Dante that Rossetti uses to preface these sonnets: "Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona" (Love, who excuses no beloved from loving; sonnet 5). These lines stand in contrast to those of sonnet 8 (cited above), where "love" remains fixed as a noun, and to those of sonnet 6 (also above), where it appears only as a verb. In La Vita Nuova, moreover, Dante's appeal is intensified by accidental complexity (stylistic and generic), that is, with the generic interaction of realism, autobiographical prose, the sonnet, the ballad, the canzone, the envoy, self-reflexive prose commentary, and visionary per- sonifications of love. Dante here speaks metaphorically and idealistically of Beatrice, but he also speaks in particular terms of his own emotions and of the setting, and he includes a distinct dramatic frame that includes particular events as well as exchanges between himself and friends of Beatrice.'4 Rossetti's donna innominata, by contrast, exists without these relations, as a vague quantity in a dramatically vacant, generalized setting. If, for example, Rossetti at moments returns to the originally proposed line of argument (in sonnet 11 she begins, "Many in aftertimes will say of you / 'He loved her'-while of me what will they say?"), she turns always to further deferrals. In addition, the effect of her rhyming is frequently uncertain, as in the following passage from Monna Innominata: Both have the strength and both the length thereof, Both of us, of the love which makes us one. (sonnet 4, lines 13-14) 843</page><page sequence="10">M O N N A I N N O M I N A T A The rhyme of strength and length constitutes inJakobson's terms a projection of the metaphoric principle across the metonymic axis, the repetition of sound across the vertical axis linking the two signifiers, but the effect here is dubious. The rhyme is imposed and unproductive, even odd, rather than the occasion of effective interaction. Thus the rhyme is not truly metaphorical but merely repetitious: analogy and identification are suggested by sonic equivalence, but this equivalence initiates no equation or transformation for the simple reason that no two things of substance exist to be related. The effect is, therefore, once again only one of tedium, and this is the more noticeable for the heavy rise and fall of the pentameter. Further examples of this sort abound: "0 my heart's heart, and you who are to me / More than myself myself'(sonnet 5, lines 1- 2), and "'Love me, for I love you'-and answer mne, / 'Love me, for I love you"' (sonnet 7, lines 1-2). Again, the poenm comes close, through the dissolution of clear signifier demarcations, to figuring a dissolution of the emotional boundaries separating individuals, and it comes close, in some cases, to dissolution of the boundaries separating human from divine love. Or, as in the last example, she may again be attempting the negation of any remaining illusions of a suspect love, since the repetition here empties the word of any useful literal meaning. Taken individually, and represented in the best light, we have here uncomplicated, conventional results, as in "Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right" (equation, identification; sonnet 12, line 12), or isolated skeptical questionings. The accumlated effect across the length of the sonnets, however, is chiefly one of mere repetition itself. The subtext, which these lines from sonnet 12 suggest as the turn from the real to Christ, offers finally a message of emptiness: that love equals sameness, equals repetition, equals continued futility. Such a subtext is a powerful one, but because the sonnets are figured by an excess of repetition and undeveloped by significant other strategies, they lapse not just into tedium, but into repetition as compulsion. Jakobson's psychoanalytic model of repetition further suggests that both Freud's explication of obsessive and ritualistic repetition and the role of genre conventions in such obsessive repetitions as Rossetti's can help illuminate this phenomenon. The sonnet and the array of demands it presents make of it something approaching a medium for unconscious, ritualistic expression. That is, the need to focus on a variety of preestablished 844</page><page sequence="11">SYLVAN ESH formal requirements, a posture to which Rossetti was early habituated and that is evidenced by her family's bouts-rimes,'5 functions in such a way as to distract attention away from expressions of a more developed thematic and personal nature. In Rossetti's case, the form becomes a medium for the unconscious expression of futility and loss. In Freud's model, as with the sonnet, the mechanism of ritual is necessarily delimited and unchanging. For Freud, the result of such a mechanism is also both the suppression and indirect expression of subconscious elements.'6 The sonnet form, by limiting line number, line length, meter, rhyme scheme, and volta, and by virtue of its conventions regarding themes and their treatment, constitutes such a mechanism. Furthermore, as suggested above, these restrictions, when experienced as restrictions or as part of occasions in which other restrictions are felt, reinforce still others. In addition, in the sonnet form, Rossetti was writing in a genre crisscrossed by the conventions of male love poetry, and in the line measure with which she was seemingly least comfortable. On the last point, however, one might observe that such discomfort ought probably to be viewed as a positive sign, over and against the arguments of critics like Ruskin. As Antony Easthope puts it, the pentameter "irons out" particularities of stress by imposing its "abstract" meter: this abstract stress pattern slows and otherwise alters the rhythms of spoken English lines; it "looks for binary uniformity of stressed and unstressed syllables. It acts to restrain, to withhold and release stress in an even distribution along the line." "Accordingly," he adds, "pentameter encourages a certain vocabulary and register in poetry."17 Easthope also notices Donald Davie's earlier observation that pentameter unifies, runs together, and in general blurs distinctions.'8 The extent to which these remarks may be relevant to Monna Innominata may be suggested by a quick comparison of any of its lines with those of "Goblin Market," or of songs that run thus: Who has seen the wind? Neither you nor I: But when the trees hold down their heads The wind is passing by.'9 There is a further sense in which the connection to ritualization holds. Not only does the sonnet form, with its rigid format and formulaic resolution, remain constant, it also institutes, in the volta, the central cyclical structure of vacillation. Monna Innominata, 845</page><page sequence="12">MONNA INNOMIN A TA as a sequence of poems (openings and closings) and as a sequence of sonnets containing voltas, which make vacillation an essential feature, constitutes a series of openings and closings, of approach and departure, that resembles Freud's famousfort-da model.20 Fort- da (in essence, "away, returned") dramatizes the child's separation from the mother, with the mother's departure and return being symbolized by the child's calling out "fort, da" while tossing and retrieving a wooden spool with a length of string. The painful matter of separation from the mother is thus resolved through an act of symbolization by which the child enjoys a measure of control. Something similar occurs in Monna Innominata, but without the metaphorical event. In all its approaches and swerves, all its conventions of opening and closing, and all its ambiguities, it mimes this action: "Come back to me . . . / Or come not yet" (sonnet 1, lines 1-2); "I dream of you, to wake . . : would that I might/ Dream of you and not wake" (sonnet 3, lines 1-2); "I loved you first: but afterwards" (sonnet 4, line 1); "O my heart's heart, and you who are to me / More than myself myself' (sonnet 5, lines 1-2); "Trust me, I have not" (sonnet 6, line 1); "'Love me, for I love you'-and answer me, / 'Love me, for I love you': so shall we stand" (sonnet 7, lines 1-2), and so on. The child's metaphorical resolution of the mother's departure is not paralleled in Monna Innominata, which is ultimately overwhelmingly metonymical for two reasons: its lack of metaphor (that is, tranformational potential) and the presence of relentless repetition. It lacks any sense of transformation or resolution except as the prepackaged resolution of Christian resignation. Vacillation occurs as vacillation, not as a movement toward symbolic resolution. If Rossetti engages the convention of the courtly love poem, one of the points of departure for critical recuperations of the poem, it should also be noted that her choice of the platonic Dantean scenario over the more carnal one of the French troubadours suggests at the outset a limited willingness to explore the specific themes of sexuality and gender her inquiry would seem necessarily to raise. From its very conception, then, a basic move toward evasive generalization determines the limited success of her project. Her brother Dante Gabriel's House of Life diverges radically from Dante's platonic and Rossetti's religious resolution; his treatment of language and situation are developed in order to express the kinds of carnal, emotional, and spiritual complications Christina Rossetti so assiduously avoids. One might possibly argue that it is precisely by denying the convention of courtly love the consummation it requires that Rossetti undermines it-that Rossetti may also have noted the 846</page><page sequence="13">SYLVAN ESH connection between the sonnet form and the equally artificial and arbitrary restrictive male code of love poetry with which the form is associated, and that she had therefore set out on some level to subvert it. Such an argument in my estimation would be at least partially correct, as I have suggested. Finally, however, this reading is only partly satisfactory for two reasons: the consummation remains intact, because Rossetti merely shifts it from an earthly to a heavenly reference; and the objective of "giving voice" to the silent lady is never realized. To this extent the poem must be read as either a simple failure or an evasion of a problem that is, whether culturally or personally grounded, beyond the poet's ability to articulate and confront. There are, obviously, general cultural grounds for this failure. As a woman, as a woman poet, and as a woman of ethnically mixed parentage, Rossetti inevitably encountered entrenched difficulties of which her brothers could remain oblivious, both on a personal level and with respect to the gendered aspects of the genre. There is, however, one specific cultural reason for Rossetti's evasion of metaphor that seems worth singling out for special note. Rossetti's suppression of the metaphor would seem to have been reinforced by certain trends among the conservative attitudes toward metaphor characteristic of rhetoricians popular during the period, particularly one of the most best known of these, Richard Whately. His Elements of Rhetoric, originally published in 1828, went on to play a central role in the generally conservative aesthetic, social, and political tendencies of the middle Victorian period, written as it was for the sizeable, largely business-minded middle-class audience.21 Whately worked at Oxford at the time of Cardinal Newman's Tractarian movement there, and the two were closely related influences on Rossetti. Central to Whately's approach was the condemnation of metaphor on the grounds that it could bring only confusion to the serious treatment of ideas, a position Newman consciously adopted for his own prose style. Rossetti's adoption of this position in the first place, however, would have been grounded on or, at the least, reinforced by, preexisting, socially generated inclinations for restrictions of form and theme precisely because these allow for postponement, repression, and deferral rather than decisive aesthetic and political development. The avoidance of trope is, like other manifestations of metaphor avoidance throughout Rossetti's text, a primary indicator of an underlying and more basic repression. In her recent Christina Rossetti: The Poetry of Endurance, Delores Rosenblum does not link repetition in the poetry to this underlying motive. Although she maintains that repetition was the basic 847</page><page sequence="14">MONNA INNOMINATA strategy by which Rossetti sought to deny change and differentiation, and although she goes on to link this with a tendency for generalization that distances the speaker from the world of particulars, she accepts Rossetti's claim of "renunciation" at face value and suggests that "There is no enemy here."22 In Rosenblum's reading, "change for the Rossettean female figure means insertion within the natural cycle, and hence decline," and to counter this entropy, Rosenblum argues, Rossetti manipulates the "paradoxical reversals of Christian ideology and sets up a symbolic system by which she can determine her own female 'progress."'23 Rosenblum's is both a work of value and an example of the kind of misreading that such ambitious attempts at recuperation tend to generate. I have read "the paradoxical reversals of Christian ideology" as wishful, ineffectual attempts to assert an illusion, and as further confirmation of this reading I will conclude by considering briefly one of Rossetti's meditative sonnets that turns on just such a paradoxical reversal. This is the sonnet dedicated to Cardinal Newman, one that very few critics have considered, and one not often included in collections of her poems.24 Rossetti admired Newman deeply, and the occasion of his death brought the need for assurance that his life-work would be remembered and rewarded. Her poem is a sonnet, and one rife with repetition. In addition, it includes at its very center a paraphrase of Christ's paradoxical declaration that "the first shall be last, the last shall be first," a cliche of Christian humility that was central to Rossetti's own orientation (as Rosenblum also notices). I give here the final six lines: Now night has come to thee-please God, of rest: So some time must it come to every man; To first and last, where many last are first. Now fixed and finished thine eternal plan, Thy best has done its best, thy worst its worst: Thy best its best, please God, thy best its best.25 The pressing problem for Rossetti here, on the occasion of Newman's death (hence also his reckoning), is to reconcile the renowned cardinal with that tenet of humility central to her personal notion of Christianity: in the end, as Christ said, the first shall be last, and the last first. In this construction, which appears at several points throughout the gospels (most completely in Matthew 20:16), humility is the highest virtue, with pride belonging wholly to the devil. Rossetti's problem, then, is the problem perpetually facing Christians concerned with both humility (the 848</page><page sequence="15">SYLVAN ESH erasure of self) and ambitious achievement in the religious and cultural spheres. Her attempt is to bring, by way of poetic sleight of hand (by repetition and paradox), the cardinal's earthly glory and prosperity into line with this tenet in such a way that his "firstness" may really be viewed as some form of "last"-in order to allow him, finally, to be "first" once again. The phrase "first and last" serves, in formal terms, as the crux of the sonnet, as its real turning point: in rhetorical terms, as part of an overall rhetorical strategy, it serves as the center of a network of repetitions; in psychological terms, it serves as the central point of a series of repetitions that effect both repression and, through this, an extreme instance of rationalization; and, finally, approached by the critic as the seat of the poem's inner contradiction, it exposes, against itself and against the poem, the basis of all these strategies-the desire to subvert the real by a turn into religious mystification. Note in particular thle repetitions of the last two lines, with the extreme reduction of meaning effected with respect to the terms "best" and "worst," and how this reduction extends also back to the similar set "first and last." The history of Christian paradox is involved and sometimes fascinating. Peter Brown, in his recent Power and Persuasion in Late Antiquity, represents a classic instance when he notices how fourth- and fifth-century churchmen like Ambrose and Augustine "wielded with dazzling effect the rhetoric of paradox" and tended to step "into the limelight that they had brought to bear on the illiterate monks, apostles, and martyrs."26 He also cites Dipesh Chakrabarty's observation regarding recent leaders of Indian political mass movements, who often willingly shared the markers of high status generated and maintained by the elite. "[A]n appeal to the idea of sacrifice," Chakrabarty notes, "was really an appeal to the power that flowed from inequality. In order to be able to make sacrifices, one needed to possess. . . . To talk of sacrifice was thus to talk of possessions, and hence of power."27 The tax system, meanwhile, and the political and military structures that forcibly maintained it, remained unchanged by Christianity. As Brown notes: "Ambrose ended his life disillusioned by his inability to control the unbridled avaritia, the land-grabbing and amassment of private fortunes . . . [ofJ the high officials in charge of taxation in northern Italy."28 Rossetti's move in "Cardinal Newman" is one born of desperation. Her attempt in this poem and in Monna Innominata is at base one of self-denial, and is as such, by definition, incompatible with self-realization. Such an attempt entails the betrayal of oneself, and of the reader also, through various attempts at linguistic 849</page><page sequence="16">MONNA INNOMINA TA sleights of hand. What would be truly unfortunate, however, would be for the attempt in either poem to prove in any way convincing, for this would mean-by extrapolation from "Cardinal Newman," in which the cardinal paradoxically retains his firstness-that, after all, the lowest citizens (women as well as the generally disenfranchised) would also remain incontrovertibly as they are. The argument in "Cardinal Newman" fails, however, because it can rest its case only, finally, on biblical and literary conventions whose rhetorical powers have lapsed. Meaningful expression, whether religious or literary, occurs only when the repetitions involved connect with and generate images and patterns relevant to present situations. Rossetti's renunciation here and in Monna Innominata silences this present and must for this reason be acknowledged for the act of self-subversion it is. NOTES lWilliam Whitla's "Questioning the Convention: Christina Rossetti's Sonnet Sequence Monna Innominata" is included in David A. Kent, ed., The Achievement of Christina Rossetti (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1987), pp. 82-131. Delores Rosenblum, who also appears in that volume (pp. 132-56), is also the author of Christina Rossetti: The Poetry of Endurance (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1986), some of whose arguments are considered below. C.H. Sisson, the editor of Christina Rossetti: Selected Poems (Manchester: Carcanet Press, 1984), while acknowledging many of Rossetti's poems to be unappealing for just this reason (p. 20), discounts too easily this effect with respect to the poems collected in that volume. Whitla's essay, cited above, is an engaging effort to recuperate the text, but remains unconvincing on this specific point. 2Ralph A.
