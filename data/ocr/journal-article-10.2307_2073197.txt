SASKIA SASSEN Columbia University, Morgan and Sayer's book studies the interrelations among economic, social, politi- cal, and spatial dimensions in the develop- ment of the electronics industry generally and in Britain particularly. The authors pay special attention to the changing global division of labor, patterns of comparative advantage, and the shifting relative positions of the United States, Europe, Japan, the newly industrialized countries, and other Third World countries; the industry's implica- tions for regional development and for labor in terms of both employment and the changing nature of work; and the conditions of the electronics industry in Britain and its policy implications. The book focuses not on user industries but mostly on processes internal to the electronics industry. Morgan and Sayer maintain that the approach they develop could be used to study any industry. They chose to examine the electronics industry because of its current strategic importance to modern economies. The authors are intent on battling what they consider the reductionism plaguing explana- tions of industrial development: the tendency to reduce the many concrete forms assumed by industry to a small number of aspects identified by abstract' theory, or to treat particular contingent outcomes as the only possible results of capitalist development. Furthermore, they contrast their concern with spatial development to the tendency in social sciences to separate processes from space. Morgan and Sayer show how the spatial context in which firms have evolved has significantly affected this character. Central to the authors' view of the industry is the belief that uneven development involves the articulation of processes that operate or are manifested at different spatial scales: local, regional, national, international. In Part 1 the authors introduce key theoretical perspectives that arise out of and inform their research. In Part 2 they apply these perspectives to an analysis of the electronics industry at the international level, focusing on four major sectors: semiconduc- tors, consumer electronics, computer sys- tems, and telecommunications. They show how the spatially and historically specific technological, economic, political, and insti- tutional characteristics through which capital accumulation is mediated have shaped the international division of labor of the industry. In Part 3 they examine the British electronics industry in this broader international context, looking at the interaction of regional charac- teristics and the wider structures within which regions are situated. The focus is on two very different cases in Britain: the new electronics firms in South Wales, a region associated with smokestack factories and union mili- tancy, and the so-called M4 corridor in the southeast, which fits the image of high tech environment. A particular concern in this part of the book is to compare the operation and performance of plants and management in these two different cases. Part 4 of the book summarizes the main theoretical conclusions and discusses a variety of industrial strate- gies. The main contribution of these chapters is to show how various aspects interact and constitute capital. Morgan and Sayer criticize the ahistorical or anthropomorphic character</page><page sequence="2">836 REVIEWS of many explanations (the notion that indus- tries go through different stages, from infancy to maturity). For example, they show how home work and subcontracting, which are thought of as belonging to an early stage of development, are in fact practices that can thrive in current conditions in advanced industries; they have not been inexorably eliminated by development and vertical inte- gration. One of the main contributions of this book is to show that key aspects in the new forms of organizing industry, in the policies that support the electronics industry, and particularly in occurrences of decline in various regions are all part of a process of uneven development in which the rise and fall of countries and regions is bound up. The authors deploy a vast amount of information and a set of sophisticated theoretical argu- ments to flesh out this highly complex event. Throughout the book they criticize both neoclassical and radical explanations, the first for resting on simple models of the firm and competition, the second for overemphasizing standardized production and low-wage labor. And throughout the book the authors compare the actual patterns constituting the industry with the popular image associated with it-one that cannot be disregarded because it has influenced policy. This book is a major contribution not only to the study of the electronics industry but to our broader understanding of uneven develop- ment at the global, national, and regional scale, the importance of the social organiza- tion of firms, and the relation of governments and industry. The scope of the book also explains what could be construed as a weakness: the difficulty of pulling out a few clear concise conclusions, as is evident in the somewhat rambling concluding chapter.</page></plain_text>
