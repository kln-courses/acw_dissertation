<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SONG OF GROTTI. ONE of the best known and in many respects most remarkable parts of Snorri Sturluson's Edda is the story of the magic mill and the two giantesses Menja and Fenja, told in chapter XLIII of the Skaldskaparmdll. Snorri mentions the story to explain the expression Frodi's Flour, a kenning applied to gold. There are two versions of the tale, one in a prose narrative and the other in a poem written in the metre called Fornyrdislag. The latter is evidently not the work of Snorri, but was added by a copyist2; for both versions are not agreed in some important details. Thus in the prose narrative the enemy of King Fr6Si is called Mysing, whereas he is the far-famed Hrolfr Kraki in the poem3. It is therefore probable that there existed in Scandinavia two different versions of the story. The similarity of Snorri's prose version and a well-known folktale which is still current in the Scandinavian North and elsewhere has been pointed out repeatedly4. There are, however, two fundamental differences between the Eddic narratives on the one hand and the Marchen versions on the other. The latter are unanimous in describing the mill as one of those self-working tools so common in fairy stories5. No mention is made of the two giantesses. Furthermore, the Marchen say nothing about a king showing the characteristics of Fr6Si. The pro- tagonists are generally two brothers, one rich, the other poor. The latter is given the magic mill by some benevolent being6.

He does not reap, however, the hoped-for benefits from it; the mill rather turns out to bring about his own discomfiture2. There can be little doubt that Snorri's source was a poem or a number of poems of the same type as the Song of Grotti quoted by the scribe. This song has certain peculiarities which we may call dramatic or ritualistic. Out of ninty-one lines only seventeen are descriptive3, while seventy-four are devoted to the song or lament of the two girls. This feature suggests a dramatic or liturgic origin, and this suggestion will receive a good deal of probability if such an origin will satisfactorily explain why the theme of the giantesses and King Fro6i was grafted on the old folktale of the magic quern. Snorri has a good deal to tell about King Fr66i. He describes him as a mighty king of the North and whose name was known wherever the Norse tongue was spoken. His reign was a golden age, when peace reigned on earth. No blood feud interfered with the general happiness of man, and golden rings could lie safely on Jalangrs Heath, no one taking them up4. Snorri and Saxo Grammaticus5 make Fr6oi the con- temporary of the emperor Augustus, stating that during his reign Christ was born. Other accounts, notably that of Saxo6, agree with the version of Snorri, and it has been noted by scholars that King Fr6oi is merely the god Frey in human form, an anthropomorphic or perhaps euhemerized deity of the fertility of the earth, a god of plenty, whose reign was a golden age of peace and prosperity, but came to a sudden and disastrous end7. Both Snorri and Saxo mention these features, but Snorri stands alone in connecting the king's death with the two giant- esses and the magic quern. Scandinavian tradition does not help us further in the solution of the problem, and we must look for parallels elsewhere, trusting that the comparative method may be of avail where the philological alone cannot be applied for lack of documents. The owner of the quern borrows a measure from his brother to measure his gold. The brother besmears the measure with tar, and a piece of gold remains sticking to the bottom of the vessel; cf. on this motif Bolte-Polivka, II, p. 143, n. 1. 2 So in the versions of Dasent, Rittershaus and Kihnau. 3 G.

In quite a number of countries they were said to have ruled in olden times, and their rule is described as a reign of peace and plenty, a golden age; for it is one of the oddities of the human mind to imagine that age of bliss to lie in the past, irre- vocable and lost for ever'. Thus the Egyptian priests spoke of such a wonderful age before the rise of the royal dynasties of the Pharaohs2. The compilers of Genesis as well as Hesiod were animated by the same ideas, and the age of reason saw a strange revival of such primitive fancy in the brilliant sophistries of Jean Jacques Rousseau. Osiris and Saturnus are the Egyptian and Italian counterparts of the Norse Fr6Si. It likewise is a common peculiarity of all these myths that the golden age comes to a sudden end. The good prince dies a violent death and departs this earth for ever, to withdraw to the far-off island of the blessed, a mythical fairy land. Generally, the names of those mythical kings were not forgotten. Their death was celebrated in annual festivals, mourning festivals, as a rule, followed sometimes by wild out- bursts of joy at the news that the god-king had risen from the dead. Thanks to Sir J. G. Frazer's monumental work we are all familiar with such imaginings and the corresponding rites, which recur in Egypt, in Syria, in Phrvgia and which are doubtless at the root of the Oriental religion whose destiny it was to supplant the older ones and to take root among the most progressive nations of the ancient world. One of these festivals of general mourning over the death of a vegetation demon was annually celebrated in Mysia, on the coast of the Propontis. It was connected with the name of King Kyzikos, said to have ruled over the Doliones in ancient times. His fate is narrated by quite a number of ancient writers and alluded to by others3. It may be summarized in the following words. Kyzikos, a young king, betrothed to Kleite4 hospitably receives the Argonauts when they land on his shores, in obedience to an oracle. When they depart they are driven back to their moorings by contrary winds. In the darkness of the night they are mistaken for enemies by their hosts5 and are attacked. In the fray Kyzikos is slain by Iason, or, 1 Tylor, Primitive Culture, New York, 1883, i, p. 40; Researches into the Early History of Mankinld, New York, 1878, p. 152; Andree, Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche, N.F., Leipzig, 1889, p. 21. 2 Maspero, Histoire ancienne des peuples de l'Orient, Paris, 1886, pp. 18 and 33. 3 Stoll in Roscher's Ausfiihrliches Lexikon, n, 1, cc. 1772-6; Sir J.

After realizing the fatal error, the Argonauts give him honourable burial and institute funeral games3. Apollonius Rhodius mentions the fact that the inhabitants of Kyzikos celebrated their eponymous hero by an annual mourning festival4. Another myth narrated that Kleite, in despair at the death of her betrothed, hanged herself. From her tears arose the spring called after her name'. Scholars are agreed in regarding Kyzikos as one of those innumerable youths doomed to a premature deaths, and instinctively we recall Hyakinthos, Hylos, Attis, Adonis, Osiris, and Balder. Kleite's tragic death especially reminds us of the death of Nanna, so touchingly told by Snorri Sturluson. Practically all these heroes, Greek and Barbarian, have been recog- nized as fertility demons representing the growing and decay of vegeta- tion in the temperate zones7. The mode of their death varies in the different myths and even in different variants of the same myth. Thus Osiris and Balder are killed by the wiles of envious twin brothers8. Adonis and Attis perish by the tusks of a wild boar, the representative of the chthonic powers. Hylos is snatched by water nymphs. The death of Kyzikos itself is told differently by the various authors of antiquity. According to one version he is killed by accident, being hit by a stray arrow9. Others narrate that his people mistook the Argonauts for enemies and attacked them, and that he was killed in the fray by night. According to still other sources, he recognized the error and desired to separate the fighting parties, but met with his death in this attempt. The latter accounts stand alone in stating that Kyzikos' people attacked the Argonauts on their first landing, because they came from Thessaly and because the Doliones, having themselves been driven thence, bore a grudge against the inhabitants of that country10. There are reasons which make it probable that in this point the version preserved by the scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius stands closer to the original than any of the others. Kyzikos is a local hero revered by the inhabitants of Mysia. His 1 Orph., Argon., 527. 2 Schol. Ap. Rhod., Argon., I, 1040. 3 Ap.

The connection between the two is too loose, and the episode can safely be dropped altogether without leaving a gap in the Argonaut story. Of the genesis of the Greek epic of Iason and Medeia it is known that a large number of legends localized along the shores of the Aegean, the Propontis and the Black Sea became attached to the kernel, which narrated the tragic fate of Iason and his wife and which is based on the Marchen of the Quest of the Princess with the Golden Hair, as I have endeavoured to show in a study forthcoming in Folk-Lore. While connecting the Kyzikos episode with the Argonaut epic, the re-workers of the epic material had to adopt certain precautions and modifi- cations. Should the Argonauts have slain the kindly king wilfully, an odious light would have been shed on the heroes of the expedition. Hence the necessity of introducing the fatal error. In the original version of the Kyzikos myth, the account such as it existed before the connection with the Argonaut story, matters are likely to have happened very much as they do in the variant handed down by the scholiast; the king perishes at the hands of a hostile band of invaders who fall upon his people at night. Such a version presents a striking similarity with the end of King Frd6i as narrated in the Skdldskapermdl. Even the story of an old feud, such as is alluded to in the Norse poem, recurs in the words of the scholiast who mentions the old enmity of the Doliones and Thessalians. There exist then the following parallelisms between the myths of Kyzikos and Fr6oi: 1. Both are mythical kings and vegetation demons. 2. Their reign is a golden age, a time of peace and plenty. 3. This happy time suddenly ends, for 4. The good kings are killed by a hostile band of invaders from the sea. 5. According to one version recurring in both myths, those enemies are actuated or are thought to be actuated by an ancient feud. The authors of antiquity have transmitted to us several interesting details concerning the annual festival in collmmemoration of Kyzikos. Its most prominent feature seems to have been a grinding festival, that is, a ceremony where all celebrants took a hand-mill and ground, accompanying their work with doleful dirges. The subject of these songs was King Kyzikos and his fatal death'. Grinding ceremlonies of 1 Klausen, op. et loc. cit. Ap.

They are incidental to an agricultural population and are likely to have existed wherever religion was intimately connected with the work of the soil. There is evidence to show that they were not limited to Southern Europe and the Near East, but existed in Central and Northern Europe as well. The chroniclers of the middle ages refer to the songs which accompanied them as cantilenae molares, and a Swiss legend, localized at Winterthur, gives an aetiological explanation of such a local ritual, the endurance of the women who turned a hand-mill after the two regular mills had been destroyed during a siege2. Furthermore, songs which accompany the work on the hand-mill are found all over the earth3, and Plutarch quotes a few lines, the fragments of an ancient mill song from Lesbos4: "AXet, ,uvXa, a\Xet tcatl yap Iltrracos adXet, /ueydXaa MtlrvXd'va /3acrt\XEW. The frequent mention of the 67rtlV\XtotL 8al likewise shows that these songs formed a special genre of folksongs in antiquity. The common characteristic of these mill songs is a prevailing tone of sadness, not to say melancholia, which pervades them5. It is such a ritual attached to the god-king of the Scandinavian North which gave origin to the story of the grinding giantesses connecting FroSi's death with the work of the grinders. In other words, the myth of Fr6oi's mill is an aetiological myth explaining why the death of the mythical king was sung by grinding girls at the grinding festival which probably commemorated his premature end, just as did the grinding ceremonies in Mysia with regard to Kyzikos. The folktale suggested the magic quern which was held responsible for the golden age of Fro6i's reign at a time when T'r\l TLS wrdcrCaacLaL isT6ros, ovu ' ertL arp6v et dXwiv p'yoLo /,Uv\wXrlbU rov e(VWovro aXX' atiwrs adpXeKTa ita'eo'Kov tovTres. evo' iTL vOv, envT' a v oY'Lp eT'i7a X'vrXa XeowvTra K6IKOV ievaiovres 'Iaoves, lnreSov alet 7rav6ru4.otLo /LVXrqs 7reXavovs bTraXerpe6ovo-tv. 1 Cf. the name Eleusis, possibly connected with dXew, de Saussure, Melanges Nicole, 1905, p. 509.

A necessary consequence of the grafting of this tale on the FroSi legend was the darkening of the character of the king who came to be an avaricious monarch, a feature which occurs in no other account of his reign'. Furthermore, the trait of the mill grinding happiness and peace is certainly the addition of a later period, more addicted to philosophical speculation2. The development of the myth will best be shown in a table representing the subsequent stages. I. Legend of god-king, prince of peace in the golden age. His violent death at the hands of pirates puts an end to the time of bliss. Grinding festival in com- memoration of his death. Mourning. II. Explanation sought to account for the connection of the grinding ritual with FroWi. The happiness of Fr6S-i's reign and his downfall attributed to grinding demons handling a magic quern. III. The aetiological myth in its turn influences the ritual. The grinding women represent the grinding giantesses and sing a lament. IV. In a reflective age Fr65i is said to have been actuated by greed, the auri sacra fames. The giantesses grind abstractions instead of material treasures. There are some more points which tend to show the identity of certain mythological clusters, if we may use this term, both in Mysia and in the Scandinavian North. The monarch who in Saxo's work corresponds to the Fr6ii of Snorri is undoubtedly Frotho III, whose reign is told of at length in the fifth book of the Gesta Danorum. There he meets a different end; he is killed by the tulsk of an evil witch who had transformed herself into a sea-cow. Saxo connects this episode with the story of the golden bracelet hung up by order of the king to testify to the honesty of the people and the golden peace of his reign3. We may safely reject this connection as well as the witch story, as the work of the compiler whose rationalistic tendencies are sufficiently known. We have then to start with the fact that Fr6oi perishes by the tusk of a wild animal. This mode of death of the vegetation demon is found, however, in the cults of the Near East, where both Attis4 and Adonis5 are killed by a wild boar; similarly the hero Hyleus is killed by the Calydonian boar6, and the seer of the Argonauts, Idmon, finds the same end7. 1 Von der Leyen, op. cit., p. 60. 2 Ibid. 3 Saxo, ed. cit., pp. 169-170. 4 Gruppe, Griechische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte, Munchen, 1906, p. 1531. 5 Frazer, Apollodorus, ii, pp. 84-85. 6 Ibid., I, p. 69. 7 Ibid., I, p. 109; cf. also Ap.

FjQlnir falls into a vat of mead and is drownedl. The same story is told by Saxo Grammaticus who attributes it to the Swedish king Hunding2. No less a scholar than Ludwig Uhland3 pointed out that this episode of the king's death was in harmony with the notion of the golden age and its sudden end. The king died of the very abundance of all good things which had made his reign a time of prosperity. The correctness of this interpretation is fully confirmed by a Swiss legend reported by E. L. Rochholz and which presents the following reading4: Die grossen Leute, die ehedem das Simmenthal bewohnten, haben einen Schlag von Rindern besessen, der fur alle Stalle zu gross war, und man liess daher das Vieh stets im Freien. Jede Kuh gab des Tages drei Eimer Milch, daher molk man sie, anstatt in Gebsen, in einen Weiher. Die Treppe, die zu ihm hinab fiihrte, war aus Kaslaiben gebaut, den Anken fiillte man in hohle Eichbaume. Mit Anken polierte man Hanswand und Scheunenthor, mit der Milch wusch man Geschirr und Stuben- boden. In einem Einbaumn fuhr man auf dem Weiher, itm die Nidel abzurahmen, und warf sie mit Schaufeln statt mit der Gone ans Ufer. Bei einem grossen Sturm- winde trat dieser Milchweiher einmal aus und ersiafte die grossen Leute miteinander. It is significant that precisely the same legend occurs in the cycle which can be considered as having King Kyzikos as its central figure. Strabo5 relates the following story of Piasos, father of Larissa, who ac- cording to some authors was the betrothed of Kyzikos6. ev e rT7 4)pLKOVi8e AapIr'z re atfJjdOat XeyeraLt HIiao'o9, Ov 4actv apxoVra IleXacryt)v epaaOrijat ri)1?

The prospective father-in-law of Kyzikos dies then the same death as King Fj2lnir in Snorri and King Hunding in the Gesta Danorum, as the people of the golden age in the Swiss legend. One more feature must be brought out here, though no excessive importance can be attached to it. Saxo relates at considerable length the doings at the court of King Frotho III during that monarch's minority. Among the less pleasant facts mentioned by the chronicler the reprehensible conduct of Frotho's queen plays a conspicuous part. l I,glilga Saga, cap. 11. Ed.

Kyzikos' be- trothed is debauched by her own father1. A Spanish legend tells2 of the disloyalty of the queen of Wamba, himself doubtless a vegetation demon, though identified with a historical personage3. King Solomon, who in Byzantine and Russian legend is the true counterpart of Fr46i, a king of superhuman wisdom and renown, is not more fortunate in matters matrimonial4, and if King Arthur and Charlemagne are made to play a similar rl1e in mediaeval legend and folklore, it is not at all unlikely that the notion of their reign being a golden age, a time of peace and plenty, had something to do with it. However this may be, added to the foregoing facts, the conjecture may not be without significance. The doings at Fr6oi's court are very probably the reflections of the general licence so characteristic of the Saturnian age and the Saturnian festivals5. Inquiring into the reason of these striking similarities of the Scandi- navian and Mysian legends or legendary cycles, the answer which would naturally suggest itself would be ethnographic kinship as responsible for it. No serious objections can be opposed to such an answer. The population of Mysia in historical times was a blending of races with strong Phrygian and Thracian elements. This mixture was indeed so intense that it was impossible to draw a clear demarcation line between Phrygia and Mysia6. The Phrygians were undoubtedly of Indo-European stock7 and closely related to the Thracians. Identity of mythological and religious conceptions would then be the natural conclusion which would doubtless have been drawn by the mythologists of the school of Max Miller. Nevertheless, I very miuch hesitate to offer this explana- tion. The worship of the vegetation demon and god-king is met with all over the Near East, in Italy and Scandinavia, among Aryans, Semites and Egyptians. It is partly still flourishing among Mediterranean popu- lations whose Indo-European stock is nothing less than demonstrated and who probably belong to some indigenous Mediterranean race only slightly influenced by Northern invaders8. Moreover, such cults and myths are closely linked up with the technique of agriculture which was 1 Marquardt, p. 41; Hofer, art. cit. 2 A.

Under these circumstances 0. Gruppe's theory of the migra- tion of cults and myths' appears to be infinitely more probable in this case. In concluding it might be well to emphasize on how frail a basis all researches of this nature must necessarily rest, as data are sorely lacking to guide the investigator through the maze of traditions often contra- dictory. All he can do at best is to group his facts under a viewpoint which appears to be justified and in accordance with facts and data brought to light by others, in various fields. New finds, archaeological and anthropological, will doubtless correct many errors. In the meantime, what can be asserted with a fair degree of probability would be that the Song of Grotti owes its origin to an ancient grinding ritual such as we know was practised in Greece and the Near East, that the Norse Frdti is a vegetation demon, closely akin to Kyzikos, Adonis and others, and that his reign, the golden age of peace and plenty, came to a sudden end, either by a band of foreign invaders, or through his own death by the tusk of a wild animal, while both in the North and in Mysia there existed also a tradition according to which another figure, likewise a vegetation demon or connected with such a one, found his death by drowning in a vessel of mead or wine. The story of the disloyalty of Fr66i's queen as told by Saxo has parallels elsewhere, which suggests that the domestic misfortunes of the Norse king are probably not for- tuitous, but in line with his character of a Saturnian king2.
