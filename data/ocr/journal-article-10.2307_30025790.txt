How liberalism kills democracy or Sen's theorem revisited ANTOINE BILLOT* Universitj Paris 2 and Institut Universitaire de France, CERAS-Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussdes, Paris, France; e-mail: billot@u-paris2.fr Accepted 10 September 2002 Abstract. First, a general qualification rule based on individual preferences is proposed which allows any given coalition to distinguish among its members some individuals who are said to be qualified by it since sensitive in preferences with all individuals of this coalition. A particular qualification rule, the liberal one, is then introduced as a rule conferring the power to qualify or disqualify any individual on the individual himself. Now, since each preference property corresponds to a qualification property, the liberal qualification rule is precisely characterized by individual preferences. Second, a delegator, that is a mapping describing a subset of delegates within the society, is defined to justify the standard notion of decisiveness. The idea of delegation allows us to generalize Arrow-Sen framework. This is done by means of a collective rationality postulate such that a coalition must be competent, i.e. includes all delegates, to be decisive. Then, we prove that (1) there exists a delegate who is qualified by any coalition he belongs to, (2) such a delegate is a dictator iff the qualification rule is liberal, (3) the qualification rule is liberal iff the preferences are selfish. 1. Introduction 1.1. Liberalism and democracy The idea of the logical opposition between liberalism and democracy has been well known since Sen's seminal contribution (1970). Sen's analysis of liberalism is made in Arrovian terms, that is by means of a social choice function and an exogenous decisiveness criterion. A social choice function maps any profile of individual preferences to a social preference and an indi- vidual is said to be decisive for two alternatives if the social preference orders these alternatives as the individual does. The liberal principle, as presented by Sen, is based on the assumption that many choice situations are properly resolved by the individual alone (the private domain)' while the democratic principle is based upon another assumption that there are choice situations * I thank James W.

However, the society can consider that eating meat is dangerous and then forbid it after a vote in its parliament which then extends the public domain to include individual food choices (resp. shrinks the private one). On the contrary, the society can decide that it is legal for individuals themselves to punish people who attack them which then extends the private domain (resp. shrinks the public one). Hence, for a given set of choice situations, the more a society is liberal, the less it seems to be democratic. This is called the "Liberal Paradox". This kind of presentation is consistent with the mainstream social philo- sophy which can be divided into two groups according to a very basic opposition. Some of the political doctrines assume that Nature is perfect and others assume that it is imperfect. The formers then require the social system to remain totally neutral3 and the latters, on the contrary, wait for the society to intervene and correct the natural imperfections of the system.4 One of the main purposes of this paper is to argue that this opposition can be analyzed in terms of qualification: for the nonliberal socialist thesis, the society embodied in the State is the only institution qualified to intervene and correct Nature's imperfections while, for the liberal thesis, each individual is only qualified by himself to represent his own interests. The liberal case fits perfectly with the condition L(iberalism) of Sen (1970) and leads consistently to the "state of Nature" as defined by Nozick (1974). 1.2. Qualification In order to model this concept of qualification, we have to enter a new re- search field. In very recent papers (Kasher and Rubinstein, 1998; Samet and Schmeidler, 2000), a formal link has been made between the social welfare approach and the more sociological (political?) problem of group identific- ation (that we interpret as "group qualification"). In many circumstances, it is necessary to determine who is who: in Panjab, determining who is a Sikh is necessary because the Sikhs are the legal guardians of some particular temples (McLeod, 1989); in Israel, determining who is a Jew is necessary to justify and apply the "Law of Return" (Kasher, 1993). Similarly, as suggested by Samet and Schmeidler (2000), such models of group identification can be used in broader contexts to determine who is rich or poor or even tall or short. Any binary criterion naturally divides the population into two subpopulations. In the above quoted literature, the key point is to translate the aggregation problem into a qualification one, that is to structure the alternatives in such a way that they become subsets of individuals. In other words, individuals</page><page sequence="3">249 choose socially among individuals to determine who is who. Indeed, it is always possible to reinterpret such a qualification problem in a standard so- cial welfare framework a la Arrow-Sen. If society has to decide who can read "Lady Chatterley's Lover" (as in Sen's example), the problem can be seen as the binary determination of the pro-right-to-read agents and the anti- right-to-read ones and then, leads to a standard preference analysis. Hence, apart from the two identity examples (Sikh, Jew), numerous economic and/or sociological situations can be designed where the notion of "group"5 seems to determine individual behavior. For instance, clothes are chosen accord- ing to the look people want in order to signal social membership (tie vs. pull-over, short vs. long hair...). The same holds for books and newspapers (Time vs. Newsweek, Le Figaro vs. Lib6ration...), jobs (private vs. public sector), even furniture, cars or computers... All this can finally be described within preferences. To be brief, preferring is also membership or desired- qualification/identification signalling, Hence, instead of Kasher-Rubinstein's question ("Who is a J?"), we propose some neoCartesian slogan: "Choosing for being Chosen"6 where, for an individual, "Being chosen" means "Being qualified". We define a qualification rule as a mechanism such that an individual is qualified by a certain group if (1) his preferences are sensitive to the group members' and/or (2) he shares something (possibly translated by a social connection) in common with all the group.7 It can be an identity (the Sikhs, the Jews,...) or/and an interest (lobbies, trade-unions,...). The next step is to model liberalism with the help of such a qualifica- tion process. In the literature, there are two variants of liberalism: one is formulated in social choice theory terms (Sen, 1970; Gibbard, 1974), the others is formulated in game theory terms (Gardenfors, 1981; Sugden, 1981; Gaertner, Pattanalk and Suzumura, 1992). Nozick (1974) criticized the first since based on preferences and Riley (1989) tries to gather both approaches by proposing his own definition of liberalism applied to a game form, namely the existence of a strategic equilibrium in pure strategies for every preferences profile. Our definition of liberalism is consistent with Sen's as well as Kasher- Rubinstein's and Samet-Schmeidler's. In other words, it is simultaneously based on preferences and leads to a qualification rule such that the power to qualify and disqualify any individual rests completely in the hands of the individual: hence, the individual's delegation is null, the agent finally is the only "institution" considered able to represent him.8 1.3. Decisiveness and democracy Liberalism is defined in terms of qualification. In return, democracy seems to be less formal. In Sen's works, especially in conditions L and L*, the link</page><page sequence="4">250 between the private and the public domains is directly expressed in terms of individual and collective preferences. Actually, as in Arrow (1951), an individual decision to be private is necessarily decisive: if an agent is free to choose meat rather than fish and no one can prevent him eating meat, his decision is then collectively accepted. Otherwise, choosing meat rather than fish is not private if someone, the whole society or even some other individuals, can prevent him eating meat. This way, a private choice needs to be validated by the society, that is, collectively authorized and accepted. Hence, private choices are democratically validated if and only if they are decisive. Decisiveness is the key point of Sen's analysis of liberalism as well as Arrow's analysis of dictatorship (consequently, that of democracy). In both cases, decisiveness is defined as a direct relationship between individual pref- erences and collective ones. Here, we suggest reinterpreting this concept in order to base the decisiveness of a given coalition upon its social competence: a group of individuals must be socially competent to be decisive. This allows us to restrict the number of decisive individuals (as Sen does in the minimal condition L*) to those who can be said to be competent. For that, we propose distinguishing a subset of individuals within the society, called delegates, who are naturally decisive and competent by themselves. But, these delegates export their competence to all the coalitions which qualify them: if a doctor is competent to decide among several therapies, the hospital where he works can be considered competent as an institution for the same decision. Indeed, in our framework, a delegate looks more like a representative, that is someone having a large power of decision, rather than an expert for specific problems. Nevertheless, the logic of delegation is this: the strength of a coalition is more dependent on its closeness to the delegates (the representatives, for instance) than on its size. Then, an amazing fact occurs: if a coalition must be competent to be decisive, there exists a delegate who has a veto power and this delegate is a dictator (in Arrow's terms) if and only if the qualification rule is liberal. Hence, dictatorship can be viewed as a liberal phenomenon: liberalism finally kills democracy! 1.4. The results In Section 2, we present the economic model with agents, issues and pref- erences. In Section 3, a general qualification rule is introduced, based on individual preferences. This allows each prior coalition to distinguish among its members some individuals who are said to be qualified by it since sensitive in preferences with all individuals of this coalition. Since each preference property corresponds to a qualification property, the liberal qualification rule can be precisely characterized. Then, a delegator, that is a mapping describing a subset of delegates within the society, is defined in order to justify the</page><page sequence="5">251 standard notion of decisiveness which allows us to generalize Arrow-Sen's framework. This is done in Section 4 by means of a collective rationality postulate such that a coalition must be competent, i.e. includes delegates, to be decisive. Then, we prove that (1) there always exists a delegate with a veto (Theorem 2), (2) such a delegate is a dictator if and only if the qualification rule is liberal (Theorem 4), (3) the qualification rule is liberal if and only if the preferences are selfish (Proposition 4). In Section 5, a last theorem (Theorem 5) gathers all previous results and establishes the equivalences. 2. The standard economic model Consider a fixed finite set S of n individuals i,j,k... and call it society. Call coalition any subset of 2s. Consider X as a set of options a, b, c... that can be candidates, programs, commodities... Call issue any vector x of Xn such that the ith coordinate xi corresponds to a particular option of X that is allocated to (or chosen by) individual i. Basically, any option can be allocated to (or chosen by) any individual. The set Xn is the n-size set of all possible individual issues.9 For any coalition A C S, XA denotes the tuple {xilieA. Furthermore, if z = (XA, Y-A), it means that zi = xi E X for all agents i E A and zj = yj E X for all the other agents j E A. Each agent i E S is assumed to rank the issues according to his individual preference relation _i that is a complete binary relation defined over Xn x Xn: V(x, y) E (Xn)2: X &gt;i y or y &gt;-i x. This way, x &gt;i y means that for i, issue x is at least as good as issue y. Two issues x, y are considered as indifferent, that is denoted x ~i y when, simultaneously, x &gt;i y and y &gt;i x. 2.1. General preference properties Consider the following list of (Preference) assumptions: Assumption P1 (preference reflexivity): Vi E S, Vx e Xn: x &gt;-i x. Assumption P2 (preference transitivity): Vi E S, V(x, y, z) e (Xn)3 [x -i y and y -i z] = [x _i z]. Each individual preference hi is assumed to be a complete weakorder.l0 Denote by W the set of all possible complete weakorders defined over Xn.</page><page sequence="6">252 Call preferences profile any vector &gt; of Wn that corresponds to the actual weakorders of the individuals belonging to S: &gt;-= (&gt;-1, (&gt;-2,..., (&gt;-i,... (&gt;-n). 2.2. Specific preference properties In order for individual preferences not to be degenerate in the sense of a uniform indifference (in which case there would be no aggregation problem), we make the following assumption: there always exists a pair of issues between which the individual is not indifferent. Formally: Assumption P3 (preference nontriviality): Vi e S, 3(x, y, z) e (Xn)3" (Xi, Z-i) &gt;-i (yi, Z-i-) In mainstream economic theory, the hypothesis of selfishness means that each individual is only concerned with what happens to him. His preference and choices never depend on the options that are allocated to other individuals within any given issue: Assumption P4 (preference selfishness): Vi e S, V(x, y, z) e (Xn)3" (Xi, Y-i) ~i (Xi, Z-i), This last assumption clearly deals with the kind of relationship individuals have with others. Selfishness must be viewed as a description of a particular kind of behavioral rationality leading to the idea, for instance, that parents are not really sensitive to their children's choices in the sense that they can choose according to their own preferences even if they are in contradiction with their children's interest. Hence, on a pure theoretical level, selfishness leads to a binary sharing of the society of the type "us vs. them" where "them" is anybody else, without any difference, children as well as friends, neighbors as well as totally unknown people ... 11 In the standard literature, i.e. the A-S model (Arrow, 1951; Sen, 1970), axioms (P1-P3) are always explicitly satisfied (with completeness).</page><page sequence="7">253 3. Qualification and delegation 3.1. Qualification The rule of qualification we propose in this paper works as follows: any in- dividual of S whose preferences are sensitive to the individual preferences of A's members alone is said to be A-qualified. A A-qualified agent is then a true A in Kasher-Rubinstein terms, i.e. an element of the set q(A) that we simply call the qualification of A. (Notice that it is a priori possible for an agent to be qualified by a given coalition without belonging to it.) Generally, any given prior coalition can include several members whose preferences are interdependent or at least mutually sensitive for a lot of dif- ferent subjects. If not, the given coalition does not mean anything in terms of preferences: it can be people being at random in the same subway train, people born the same month... Nevertheless, if the coalition includes several interdependent individuals, it is then conceivable that this coalition (a priori neutral) socially means something: people in the same subway train may live in the same suburb or neighborhood and share the same kind of social life. To be born the same month means that people are of the same generation and then share some common values about family, nation... Formally, call qualification rule (preferences profile dependent) any map- ping q : 2s -- 2s such that, for all coalitions A, the qualification q(A) of A is defined as follows: q(A) = {i eS : (xA, y-A) "i (XA, Z-A) for all x, y, z e Xn}. Hence, the qualification of a particular coalition corresponds to all individu- als, belonging to the coalition or not, who are sensitive in preferences to the members of this coalition and which are nonsensitive (in preferences) to the rest of the society. Qualified agents always delimit a particular area of community of interests. This corresponds to a solidarity with the members of a particular group of agents. Let S = {i, j, k} and X = {a, b, c}. Then, if q(i, j) = {i, j}, this means for instance that (a; i, b; j, c; k) ~ i (a; i, b; j, a; k). In other words, since i is sensitive to j, he does not care what k chooses: he remains indifferent, whatever k's choices. Hence, for the qualified individuals, the group solidarity always dominates their individual interest. Remark 1: Note that, a priori, it can happen that, for a given coalition A e 2s, q(A)= 0.</page><page sequence="8">254 The four following results mean that preference assumptions can be interpreted as specific properties for the qualification rule, namely individual behaviors correspond to a specific organization of the society in terms of qualification. Preference reflexivity leads to qualification inclusivity (any individual is qualified by the society), transitivity to monotonicity with respect to coalition inclusion (if an individual is qualified by a given coalition A, he is also qualified by all the coalitions larger than A), nontriviality to restrictivity (to be qualified by a coalition, it is necessary to belong to it) and selfishness to selfaffirmativity (any coalition, e.g. the individual, is qualified by itself). 3.1.1. General qualification rules Proposition 1: All individual preferences are reflexive (P1) if and only if the qualification rule is inclusive, i.e. the, qualification of society is society itself: [Vi e S, &gt;i is reflexive] = [q(S) = S]. Proof. The following equation, {i E S : x --i x for all x e Xn} = S, is true if and only if all individual preferences &gt;-i are reflexive. Now, since Xs = x, we have: q(S) = {i e S : (xs, Y-s) &gt;i (xs, z-s) for all x, y, z e Xn} = {i E S : (xs, ye) &gt;i (xs, z0) for all x, y, z e Xn} = {iES:xi x forall x e Xn} = S, which ends the proof.E Inclusivity must be viewed as a kind of deep republican requirement allowing any citizen, whatever his gender, his religion or his color, to be potentially qualified by the society and then, to be one of its possible representatives. It forbids for instance all apartheid situations. In South Africa, several years ago, all black men and women were excluded of the electoral system. Then, the society did not qualify colored people to represent it. This is clearly translated by q(S) C S.</page><page sequence="9">255 Proposition 2: All individual preferences are transitive (P2) if and only if the qualification rule is monotone with respect to coalition inclusion: [Vi E S, &gt;i is transitive] &lt; [VA, B E 2s such that A C B, q(A) C q(B)]. Proof. (i) By construction, A C B =i q(A) C q(B) is equivalent to q(A) n q(B) = q(A n B). Hence, suppose any individual i E S and two coalitions A and B such that i E q(A) n q(B). By definition of qualifications, for all profiles x, y, z e Xn: i E q(A) = (XA, Y-A) &gt;i (Xa, Z-A) = (XAnB, y-(AnB)) &gt;i (XanB, yAn-B, Z-A) and symmetrically: i E q(B) = (XAnB, yAn-B, Z-A) &gt;i (XAnB, Z-(ANB)). Now: (XAnB, Y(AnB)) &gt;i (XAnB, Z-(AnB)) implies i E q(A n B) if and only if &gt;i is transitive. (ii) Suppose now an agent i E S such that i E q(A n B). Then, for all x, y, x E X: (xAnB, Y-(AnB)) &gt;i (XAnB, Z-(AnB))- Thus, (XA, y-A) &gt;i (XA, Z-A) and (XB, y-B) &gt;i (XB, Z-B) which implies: i E q(A) n q(B).E Monotonicity is close to the proportional rule of representativeness for groups (political parties, social associations ...) within democracies. Actually, this means that the number of individuals who are qualified by a small group (then that of its representatives) cannot be greater than the number of individuals qualified by a larger subset of individuals (then that of its representatives). This property is central in all democratic systems and can be seen as a rational and fair requirement. Corollary 1: All individual preferences are reflexive (P1) and transitive (P2) if and only if the qualification rule is inclusive and monotone with respect to coalition inclusion.</page><page sequence="10">256 Corollary 2: If all individual preferences are reflexive (P1) and transitive (P2), the subset Q of all nonempty qualifications is a simple game over S. Actually, by Proposition 2, inclusivity means that, for any A E Q, if A C B, then B E Q (i.e. q(A) = 0 = q(B) A 0). 3.1.2. Liberal qualification rule Samet and Schmeidler (2000) emphasized three basic features for the "Senian" works: - Options have no distinguishable characteristics. Then, the issues over which an individual is decisive must be given exogenously. - The social welfare function is not interpreted as a voting rule. - Liberalism is exactly defined as the ability of an individual to guarantee that his preference over certain issues prevails, as opposed to the ability to guarantee a certain subset of issues themselves. This approach was deeply criticized by Gardenfors (1981) and Gaertner, Pattanaik and Suzumura (1992) who then suggested a different formulation of liberalism in terms of game theory. The basic idea underlying their approach is that any individual may be identified with his permissible strategy set spe- cified under the rules of the game. By playing a strategy, the individual is able to veto some class of potential outcomes and then, to influence (rather than to exactly determine) the social choice. Moreover, this possibility is extended to group rights through an assumption of cooperative individual behavior. In the model we propose: - Decisiveness is not exogenously based on particular issues but rather on "individual competence", that is on group of qualified agents which makes the link with the "group rights" assumption in Gaertner, Pattanaik and Suzumura (1992). - The social welfare function is not really interpreted as a voting rule but rather as a general aggregation mechanism. - Liberalism is not viewed as an individual ability to impose some choices locally on the society, but rather as an individual process of decisiveness defined in terms of social networks. Liberalism is defined as a qualification rule giving the power to qualify (or disqualify) the individual to the individual himself. Formally, a liberal qualification rule q is then defined by:</page><page sequence="11">257 Vi e S, q({i}) = {i}. (Liberalism) This definition is fully consistent with that proposed by Samet and Schmeidler (2000), All qualification rules, liberal or not, are based on individual preferences. As shown above, preference properties correspond to qualification properties. This way, a liberal qualification rule formally circumscribed by its properties can be a priori specified in terms of individual preferences. Thus, it is natural to seek the preference properties which lead to define the liberal qualification. Hence, we are going to show that a qualification rule which is inclusive, monotone, restrictive (i.e. to be qualified by a given coalition, the individual must belong to it) and selfaffirmative (i.e. each individual belonging to a coalition is qualified by it) is said to be liberal in the above sense. Proposition 3: If transitive (P2), all individual preferences are nontrivial (P3) if and only the qualification rule is restrictive: [Vi e S, &gt;-i nontrivial] = [VA e 2s : q(A) C A]. Proof. (=:) Preference nontriviality means, for each individual i, that there exist issues (xi, z-i) and (yi, z-i) such that: (Xi, z-i) &gt;-i (Yi, z-i). Then, each i e q(-{i}), i.e. i E -q(-{i}). Then, by preference transitivity, the qualification rule is monotone, that is q(-A) C q(-{i}) for all A C {i}, thus i E -q(-A) for all i E A since -q(-{i}) C -q(-A). Hence, by extension: A C -q(-A) and by negation q(-A) C -A, that is, for any A : q(A) C A. (=) Suppose for all A e 2s : q(A) C A. Now, since q({i}) C {i}, -{i} C -q({i}), i.e. i E -q(-{i}), i.e. i 0 q(-{i}). Hence, by definition of q, this means that there exist issues (xi, z_i) and (yi, z-i) such that (Xi, Z-i) &gt;-i (yi, Z-i)O Restrictivity can be viewed as a constraint of legitimacy. This means that being qualified by a group requires to previously belong to it. No one can claim to represent a coalition he does not belong to. Proposition 4: If transitive (P2) and nontrivial (P3), all individual preferences are selfish (P4) if and only if the qualification rule is selfaffirmative, i.e. the qualification of the coalition is the coalition itself: [Vi e S, &gt;i is selfish] + [VA e 2s, q(A) = A].</page><page sequence="12">258 Proof. Remark first that preference selfishness can be translated in terms of qualification as follows: since (xi, y-i) &gt;-1 (xi, z_i) for all x, y, z e Xn , for all ie S, {i E S : (xi, y-i) &gt;-1 (xi, z-i) for all x, y, z e Xn} = {i}. Then, q({i}) = {i}. Second, by preference transitivity, q is monotone. Then, UiEA{i} = UiEAq({i}) C q(UiA{i}A),12 that is: A C q(A). By preference nontriviality, we already have restrictivity: q(A) C A. Hence, q(A) = A, for all A E 2S.O Selfaffirmativity is the equivalent of inclusivity for all groups. As soon as someone belongs to a coalition, he is qualified to represent it. Corollary 3: Individual preferences that define a liberal qualification rule are completely ordered, nontrivial and selfish. Corollary 4: Consider a liberal qualification rule. Then, there is no nonempty coalition such that its qualification is empty, i.e. VA e 2s - 0, q(A) = 0 and q(0) = 0 by construction. Remark 2: Inclusivity, monotonicity and restrictivity of the qualification rule do not imply a liberal qualification. In other words, in the A-S model, the assumptions about individual preferences, (Pl-P3) (with completeness), are not sufficient to imply a liberal qualification rule. 3.2. Delegators and proto-aggregators For all preferences profiles &gt;- E Wn, and all issues (x, y) e (Xn)2, X A y, call coalition for x against y the subset {i E S : x ~i y} that we denote S (x, y). Its qualification P[s&gt;- (x, y)] is denoted by convenience q(x, y). Remark 3: By construction, [A - B] = [q(A) = q(B)]. Especially, we have [S&gt;(x, y) = S&gt;(z, t)] = [q(x, y) = q(z, t)] and [S,(x, y) = S&gt;.(x, y)] = [q(x, y) = q'(x, y)]. Then, two identical coalitions have two identical qualifications but the con- trary does not hold: two identical qualifications do not necessarily correspond to two identical coalitions.</page><page sequence="13">259 3.2.1. Delegators Call delegator any mapping A, defined from 2s onto 2s, which gathers all coalitions into a particular subset of individuals called delegates, then denoted A(S&gt;), such that q[A(S_)] = A(S&gt;) and VAn C A(S_), An= 0, A(S,_), q[An1] = 0. Delegates are chosen within society S endowed with the prefer- ences profile &gt;- e Wn in such a way that the delegates are selfaffirmative as delegates but not as subsets of delegates. The notion of delegator is central in political science. It can be repres- entatives for laws (the public domain management), trade-unions for social bargaining, general institutions for specific issues (Churches, lobbies ...). The task of the delegates is to translate opinion movements, that is het- erogenous choices, into collective decisions. The implicit idea behind this notion is the following: delegates membership of a given coalition implies that this coalition can be decisive. (It is empirically obvious that any opinion movement which has no representative, lobby leader and so on, is totally powerless. In return, a small opinion movement but containing a large number of representatives has a good chance to become decisive.) 3.2.2. Proto-aggregators Call proto-aggregator any mapping E which gathers all the individual pref- erences into a collective complete one, then denoted EI(-). Hence, xE (&gt;)y means that for S, the issue x is at least as good as the issue y. A proto-aggregator is a mechanism which allows translation of individual preferences into collective preference without any technical restriction nor hypothesis. 4. Competence and decisiveness In the A-S model, we have: for all coalitions A E 2s, A is decisive for option x against option y when [A = S&gt;(x, y)] = [xE(_)y]. In this set-up, the issues are degenerate: they are single options. Then, more generally, reinterpreted in our terms, a coalition S_ (x, y) is decisive (between two issues) when S&gt;- (x, y) ＃ 0] = [xE(?)y]. This definition does not explain the notion of collective decisiveness but just describes it in very ad-hoc way since the decisiveness criterion is based upon a simple opposition between a coalition and its complement. Interdependence</page><page sequence="14">260 within the coalition plays no role. The variant we suggest is to define a decis- ive coalition, whatever its size, as a subset of individuals whose qualification is "competent" in the sense that it is "close" to delegates. For A-S, if the King and the Queen prefer x to y, then the King cannot be decisive for x against y without his wife while, with our variant, the King, as soon as he is a delegate, can export his power to any broader coalition (him and his wife, for instance) which then becomes competent. More precisely, what we suggest is more detailed insofar as the process that leads to characterize a coalition as decisive can be broken into two separ- ate steps: in the first one, we want to distinguish the coalitions which can be said competent relative to a particular pair of issues; and in the second step, we link competence and decisiveness. Hence, we propose the following definition of competence: when all del- egates are qualified by a coalition, then this coalition can be said to be competent, i.e. VA e 2s, A is competent when q(A) D A(S,). (Competence) Afterwards, we postulate a collective rationality condition: a coalition must be competent to be decisive. Formally: Collective rationality postulate: Let A be a delegator and E a proto-aggregator. Then, V(x, y) E (Xn)2, V &gt;-E Wn: [q(x, y) D A(S&gt;)] = [xE(&gt;-)y]. According to the qualification definition, this means that since no delegate is individually opposed to the A's preference for x, then society can prefer x. Note that some delegates can be indifferent between x and y while others are for x against y, or all delegates are indifferent between x and y. Nevertheless, none is strictly for y against x. Moreover, S&gt;(x, y) and S&gt;(y, x) cannot be simultaneously decisive except if q(x, y) n q(y, x) D A(S&gt;). In this case, this means that delegates are qualified on both sides (even though the two co- alitions strictly differ), i.e. they are indifferent between the two issues which implies that the society is also indifferent. Consider the example of the movement for the abolition of death penalty. Denote the abolition x, the upholding y and define the delegates A(S&gt;) as the representatives in parliament. Society is shared between the abolitionists S, (x, y) and the antiabolitionists S, (y, x). Now, even if the abolitionists are a smaller group than the antiabolitionists, it suffices that the qualification of the abolitionists includes the representatives, that is the delegates, to become competent and then to make the decision against a larger antiabolitionist</page><page sequence="15">261 movement. It was the case in France, in 1981, where the public opinion was definitely in favor of the upholding of the death penalty while the political class was for the abolition. But, the abolitionist minority represented by a "humanist" qualification, that is intellectuals, journalists, artists... won be- cause of the social closeness of this qualification with the delegates, i.e. the representatives. The same kind of explanation works for many societal choices such as abortion, euthanasia ... but also for political choices such as going on making war. For instance, immediately after 1958, the French opinion wanted the end of the war in Algeria but the conscription still went on until 61; the same happened for the Vietnam war in USA and in USSR with the Afghanistan war, These situations can always be explained by the proximity of the pro-war people with the representatives or with the decidors. 4.1. Delegator and aggregator: The link A proto-aggregator E such that the collective preference E (-) is of the same nature than any individual preference &gt;-i is an aggregator (see Rubinstein and Fishburn (1986) for further details about aggregators): Axiom Al (anthropomorphism): Let E be a proto-aggregator. Then, V &gt;- e Wn: E(_-) E W. Axiom A2 (unanimity): Let E be a proto-aggregator. Then, V(x, y) E (Xn)2, V/&gt;-E Wn: [S- (x, y) = S] = [xEI(L)y]. Axiom A3 (independence of irrelevant alternatives): Let E be a proto- aggregator. Then, V(x, y) e (Xn)2, V &gt;,&gt;'e Wn: [S_(x, y) = S&gt;-(x, y)]= [x E(-)y = xE( &gt;-')y Theorem 1: Let Xn contain at least three issues and assume that (P1-P3) are satisfied. Let E be a proto-aggregator and A be a delegator satisfying the collective rationality postulate. Then, the proto-aggregator E satisfies (A1-A3). Proof. (1) For all x e Xn, all &gt;-e Wn, S&gt;(x,x) = S by (P1) and by Proposition 1, the qualification rule q is inclusive, that is q(x, x) = S. Hence, q(x, x) D A(S&gt;) by definition. Thus, by the collective rationality postulate, xE (-)x, i.e. L (-) is reflexive. Now, suppose three issues</page><page sequence="16">262 (x, y, z) E (Xn)3 such that: q(x, y) D A(S_) and q(y, z) D A(S_). Then, q(x, y) n q(y, z) D A(S&gt;). By (P3), the qualification rule is monotone, that is q(x, z) D q(x, y) n q(y, z). Hence, q(x, z) DA (S,). Thus, by the collective rationality postulate, xE(_)z, i.e. E(&gt;-) is transitive. Therefore, since it is complete, E (&gt;) e W, i.e. is an aggregator (Al). (2) Suppose two issues (x, y) e (Xn)2 such that S&gt; (x, y) = S. Then, by (P1) and by Proposition 1, the qualification rule q is inclusive, that is q(x, y) = S. Hence, q(x, y) D A(S,) by definition. Thus, by the collective rationality postulate, xE (?)y (A2). (2) Suppose a preferences profile &gt;- e Wn and an issue z e Xn such that the preference profile &gt;'e Wn is the restriction of &gt; on Xn - {z}, with S_ (x, y) = S&gt;,(x, y) for all issues (x, y) E (Xn - {z})2. Then, A(S&gt;) = A(S&gt;,), and we know by Remark 3 that q(x, y) = q'(x, y). Hence, if q(x, y) D A(S,), then q'(x, y) D A(Si), that is by the collective rationality postulate, if xE(?)y, then xE (?')y (A3).E 4.2. The delegate theorem Veto condition: Let A be a delegator. Then, there exists an individual d E A(S&gt;) such that V -E Wn, V(x, y) e (Xn)2, if X -d y, then d E q(x, y). This axiom means that there exists a delegate who is always qualified, that is by all coalitions, for every possible pair of issues. Actually, if a coalition which contains d wishes to be decisive, it must necessarily qualify d. (Note that it is not sufficient.) If it is not the case, the coalition cannot be decisive because it is then impossible for its qualification to contain all delegates. In that sense, the delegate d E S (x, y) can block any collective preference which is not consistent with that of the coalitions he belongs to. This agent belongs to every winning coalition of the simple game Q (defined in Corollary 3): he is sometimes called the vetoer (Moulin 1988: Ch. 11, p. 298). Theorem 2 (of the delegate): Let Xn contain at least three issues while (P1-P3) are satisfied. Let E be any proto-aggregator and A be a delegator satisfying the collective rationality postulate. Then, the delegator A satisfies the veto condition. This theorem shows that there always exists a delegate who is a vetoer if the collective rationality postulate holds. This individual corresponds to a kind of 'median/representative agent': he is always qualified by the coalitions which agree with him in preferences and no coalition can be decisive without him, i.e. any deviation from his preferences is socially punished.</page><page sequence="17">263 The strategy for proving Theorem 2 is the following: Lemma 1 shows that there exist situations for which the delegates subset can be reduced to a single decisive agent and Lemma 2 that this agent is qualified, then competent and decisive, for all pair of issues. Lemma 1: Let Xn contain at least three issues and assume that (P1-P3) are satisfied. Let E be any proto-aggregator and A be a delegator satisfying the collective rationality postulate. Then, there exist two particular issues (x, y) such that the qualification q (x, y) of S_ (x, y) is a single agent d who is actually a delegate: E(x, y) E (Xn)2 s.t. [q(x, y) = {d} = A(S_)]. Proof. For (x, y) E (Xn)2, the collective rationality postulate implies: [xE(&gt;-)y] = [q(x, y) n A(S,) o 0]. Besides, by definition, the delegates qualification is the whole set of deleg- ates, i.e. q[A(S_)] = A(S&gt;) and VAn C A(S&gt;), An = 0, A(S&gt;), q[An] = 0. Hence, q(x, y) nA (S_) :A 0 implies (by monotonicity) that q(x, y) DA (S_) and then that S, (x, y) is decisive. In other words, [xE (_)y] = [q(x, y) D A(S,)], that is a coalition is (resp. is not) decisive if and only it is (resp. is not) competent. Second, let D = {A e 2s; 3(x, y) E (Xn)2 : A is competent}, the set of all coalitions whose qualification contains all delegates. By the col- lective rationality postulate and Theorem 1(A2), we know D to be nonempty since S E D. Second, define D E D such that q(D) &lt; &lt;q(A), VA e D, that is, the coalition whose qualification is the smallest one of the competent coalitions. By the collective rationality postulate and Theorem 1(A2), we know Iq(D) &gt; yq(0), i.e. yq(D) &gt; 1. If O = 1, we directly get the result since q(D) D A(S_). Hence, suppose O &gt; 1, i.e. Iq(D) &gt; 2. Now, consider the two issues, (x, y) E (Xn)2, for which D is competent: [q(x, y) = q(D) D A(S_&gt;)]. Then, since 1q(D) &gt; 2, q(D) = C U {d} with C fn {d} = 0. Take a third issue z e Xn with the following situation where q(D) = D: x &gt;d y&gt;d Z, z xi x yi y, for all i e C y Mj z yj x, for allj e D.</page><page sequence="18">264 Since D is competent for x against y, we have by the collective rationality postulate xE (?)y. Now, two possibilities occur: (1) zE (?)y or, by complete- ness, (2) yY(B)z. (1) Suppose zE(-)y. Then, it means that C = S,(z, y) is such that q(z, y) D A(S,), i.e. is competent for z against y, i.e. C E D. Then, it is only consistent with q(C) = q(z, y) = q(D) since D E D has the smallest qualification of the competent coalitions. Now, by monotonicity and restrictivity, i.e. (P1), (P2) and (P3), q(C) C C C D = q(D), i.e. q(C) C q(D). Then, C can neither be competent nor decisive and z(E ()y is impossible. (2) Suppose yE (_)z. Theorem 1(A1) implies transitivity, i.e. xE(&gt;)z. Thus, d is also the qualification of a competent coalition for x against y, that is q(x, z) = {d}. But, d cannot be, for the same reason as C, the qualification of a competent coalition. Therefore it is false that tq(D) &gt; 2. So, 0 &lt; O &lt; 2, that is tq(D) = 1. Moreover, q(D) D A(S,) by competence. Hence, q(D) = A(S_).M Lemma 2: Let Xn contain at least three issues and assume that (P1-P3) are satisfied. Let E be any proto-aggregator and A be a delegator satisfying the collective rationality postulate. Then, the delegate d is always qualified: V(x, y) E (Xn)2, [d E S_(x, y)] = [d E q(x, y)]. Proof. By definition of competence, any coalition which qualifies d is com- petent. Hence, we have to show that for all (z, t) E (Xn)2 such that z &gt;d t, d E q(z, t). By Lemma 1, d is competent for x against y, then decisive by the collective rationality postulate. Take a third issue z e Xn, x - z, y # z, and consider the following situation: X&gt;id Y&gt; dZ, Y&gt;i z &gt;i x, for all i :d. Since d is competent and decisive for x against y, then xE (_)y. By (Pl), we have also q(y, z) = S and by Theorem 1 (A2), yE(_)z since d E q(y, z). Thus, by (P3) and Theorem 1 (Al), xE (&gt;)z. Now, by Remark 3 and Theorem 1(A3), we know that the issue y can be deleted from all preferences without any change affecting x and z in terms of qualifications and delegates. Hence, S, (x, z) = S, (x, y) involves q(x, z) = q(x, y) = {d}, for all z e Xn. Take a fourth issue t E Xn, x = t, z = t, and consider the following situation: t &gt;d X &gt;dz, z -j t -j x, for all j = d.</page><page sequence="19">265 By a similar argument to the above, it is easy to show that q(t, z) = {d}, for all t, z E (Xn)2.E The logic behind the delegate theorem (Theorem 2) is very close to that of the Arrovian dictator result. Under the collective rationality postulate, there exists a delegate who is always qualified by the coalitions he belongs to. This means that he can block any issue he does not choose, i.e. he is a vetoer. This has already the flavor of dictatorship. Nevertheless, we have to prove now that a vetoer can become a dictator if and only if he does not share his power with another delegate. The intuition is as follows: when he is not sensitive to others' preference, that is when he qualifies himself, the vetoer becomes a dictator. Moreover, since any agent can a priori be a delegate, the only qualification rule consistent with the dictatorship is the liberal one. 4.3. Can a delegate be a dictator? In an A-S framework, a proto-aggregator is said to be dictatorial if there exists an individual (the dictator) such that his preference relation is exactly the one that corresponds to the society preference: Axiom A4 (dictatorship): Let E be a proto-aggregator. Then, there exists an individual d E S such that &gt;-d= (_). Theorem 3 (Arrow): Let Xn contain at least three issues and assume that (P1-P3) are satisfied. Let E be a proto-aggregator satisfying (Al-A3). Then, there exists only one aggregator E and it is dictatorial (A4). Note that there exist as many potential dictators as individuals, Hence, the meaning of dictatorship is independent of who is the dictator. Then, a priori, any individual can become a dictator, since there is nothing to distinguish within the society any "dictator candidates" who are better than others. Arrow's theorem must be read as a logical statement about the collective decision. However, here the interpretation can follow different paths: on one side, if the qualification rule is liberal, all delegates are potentially dictators; on the other side, if a delegate is a dictator, it is because he is selfaffirmative. Hence, the political phenomenon which transforms liberalism into dictatorship is purely logical. Theorem 4: Let Xn contain at least three issues and assume that (P1- P3) are satisfied. Let E be any proto-aggregator and A be a delegator satisfying the collective rationality postulate. Then, the qualification rule is liberal if and only if the proto-aggregator E is dictatorial:</page><page sequence="20">266 [Vi e S, q({i} = {i}] = [&gt;-d= E(_)].1 Proof. (=) Assume the qualification rule q to be liberal and then selfaffirm- ative. Then, q({d}) = {d} and by Lemma 2, d is competent, i.e. decisive everywhere on Xn by the collective rationality postulate, that is V(x, y) e (Xn)2, [X &gt;d y] implies [xE(&gt;-)y]. Now, consider a third issue z e Xn and the following situation: x &gt;d Z -d Y, z _j x and z &gt;-j y, for all j = d. Then, xE(&gt;)z since d is competent everywhere and zE(&gt;-)y by Theorem 1(A2) since (P1) involves inclusivity. Hence, xE (-)y by Theorem I(A1), i.e. d's preference for x against y is always decisive for E (?). In using Theorem 1(A3), it is straightforward that this conclusion holds for all situations, that is I is dictatorial. (4=) By Proposition 3, under (P2), (P3) is equivalent to restrictivity which means for individuals that q({i}) = {i} or q({i}) = 0. If the qualification rule q is not selfaffirmative (i.e. not liberal), then q({i}) = {i} for some individual i. Now, suppose that d is such that q({d}) = 0. Then, d is never decisive nor competent which violates Lemma 1.E In other words, if there is no selfish individual, there is no possible dictatorship. Interdependence between individuals is the best answer to dictatorship, This theorem helps us to better understand dictatorship as a political phe- nomenon based on individual behaviors. Individual behaviors are determinant for the structure of the society and this structure is determinant for the polit- ical system. Incidently, this reveals that the individual seek for happiness, maximal utility or profit, is politically dangerous when this happiness does not lead to an interdependent society. The main implication of this theorem is probably that we must keep on social dependence (by the redistribution and social insurance systems, cultural policies and State actions ...) if we want decreasing the political risk of dictatorship: being socially linked to be politically free. 5. Equivalence theorem and general comments Theorem 5: Let S contain at least three individuals, Xn contain at least three issues and assume that (Pl-P3) are satisfied. Let E be a proto-aggregator and A a delegator satisfying the collective rationality postulate. Then, the four following statements are equivalent:</page><page sequence="21">267 (i) Individual preferences are selfish, (ii) The qualification rule q is liberal, (iii) The proto-aggregator E is dictatorial, (iv) The delegator A satisfies the veto condition. Proof. (i =I ii) See Proposition 4 and Corollary 3. (ii = iii) See Theorem 4. (iii = iv) See Theorems 2 and 4. (iv = i) By Theorems 2 and 4, A satisfies the veto condition if and only if the qualification rule q is liberal. Then, by Proposition 4, the veto condition implies preference selfishness.E The liberal principle is based on the following observation: there exist decisions which rest with the whole society (the public domain), there also exist decisions which rest with the individual alone (the private domain).13 Intuitively (and pragmatically), the way the two domains are shared is a first possible measure of the degree of liberalism in a given society: in the XIX century, one was allowed to choose vegetables rather than meat or to lie on his back when he slept rather than on his belly (see Sen 1970: Ch. 6, §6.2.), or to be dressed in brown rather than in green. But, on the other hand, no one was allowed to have sex with a woman out of religions wedlock, nor to refuse to be a soldier. One century later, in Europe, the two last issues have become private while the two first remain private; in that sense, today's society can be said to be more liberal. In addition, the number of individuals allowed to make certain decisions for themselves may also contribute to this liberalism measure: it is obviously true that in South Africa, for instance, individual rights have increased for Black people; then, globally, South African society has probably became more liberal in the last decade. The same holds for French people after the Revolutionl4 since the privileges of the aristocracy were abolished, and for people in the West in general. In short, liberalism may correspond to an increase in the scope of the private domain, then to an increase of some individual rights within society. Karl Polanyi, in the Chapters 12 and 13 of his famous book, The Great Transformation (1944), chapters entirely devoted to the birth of the so-called liberal credo, comments on this opposition within a historical perspective: he recalls that there was a common-knowledge-social-price-to-pay for the implementation of the economic liberalism during the XIX century and that this price partly consisted of social reorganization (for instance within firms or between towns and countryside) and partly of poverty, injustice and pain for the poorest part of the society. A consistent interpretation of this "double motion" can be the following: when the public domain - that is all which is</page><page sequence="22">268 collectively or democratically decided - loses the economic organization, which means that the society delegates to the individuals the power to organize exchanges and markets, prices and wages, it also loses the right and the power to protect the weakest individuals of the society.15 Hence, when the public domain shrinks for some general economic reasons, it shrinks also by the induced consequences on the poorest individuals. Actually, these consequences cynically mean that the poorest individuals, like all others, have an increased private domain since they are no longer protected by the society, they have for example to bargain their own wage and decide if they accept or refuse the one which balances the job market even though it may be below the poverty level.16 In that sense, economic liberalism is basically inconsistent with the democratic protection of the weakest individuals in society. In a more sociological way, we can observe, on one side, in newspapers and TV programs as in the daily current life, increasing rates of divorce and family dissolution, ghettos and urban riots, political corruption and discrim- ination... all phenomena in Western countries facts which illustrate what is called the "loss of traditional values" and can be analyzed in terms of broken social links, i.e. in terms of nested social institutions which gradually disap- pear: family as a patrimonial landmark, small village (or neighborhood) as a local interdependent community, nation as a cultural sphere and so on... One possible interpretation, actually the one we have in mind, is based on the huge extension of individuals' social networks and consequently, on the decrease in each social relation intensity. At some idiosyncratic level, the intensity can be so weak that it has no more social influence.17 Using an economic analogy, this would correspond to a situation of social atomicity. On the other side, we also observe public firms privatizing, job precariousness, liberalization of the financial markets and shrinking of State assistance, economic globaliza- tion and delocalization of firms, all phenomena which can be viewed as the characteristics of the modern world and of the victory of a sort of extreme capitalism over the socialist dream. At first glance, atomicity in the social world and liberalism of the economic world then seem to be twins; at least, we are constrained to remark their historical concomitance. Finally, this paper can also be seen as a proposition for a global framework of analysis which allows both aspects to be emphasized, and furthermore, proves that they are dialectically consistent if the individual preferences are completely ordered, i.e. standard in economic theory. In other words, modem sociological facts and standard microeconomic modelling can be contained in the same logical approach.</page><page sequence="23">269 Notes 1. A private choice means that no one, individuals nor society, can prevent any individual making his choice exactly as he wants. This way, society is constrained to accept any private choice as if it is a collective one. 2. When a choice is public, this means that all individuals are asked about it and society chooses accordingly to one of its nonempty subsets (majority and dictatorship are partic- ular cases). Hence, the democratic principle must be considered as a logical concept since it does not necessarily correspond to a political "democracy". 3. This conception was Adam Smith's for instance and that of any partisan of the "spontan- eous order" theory. 4. This conception was shared by Ldon Walras, for instance, contrary to what is generally admitted. Actually, the Walrasian general equilibrium analysis was proposed in order to prove that the conditions under which there exists an equilibrium for a private ownership economy are so constraining that it is impossible to get it naturally. Walras wrote in the Revue Socialiste, XXIII, 1896, p. 394: "Rather than scientists, we can fearlessly be socialists"... (for further details, see Dumez, 1985). 5. A "group" is viewed as a subset of individuals sharing the same kind of opinion. An opinion must be here understood in a very large and neutral meaning, membership of a community, common beliefs, and so on ... 6. ... or "Since I prefer, thus I am". An applied version of this formula, "Tell me who you are, I'll tell you what you choose", is exactly the one that advertisers and announcers seek to learn in order to target specific newspapers or particular moments of the day on TV. 7. This is a relevant translation of a consent-rule when based on preferences. (For further details about the concept of a consent-rule, see Buchanan and Tullock, 1962.) 8. There exist various definitions of liberalism, philosophical, ethical... (Rothbard, Hayek, Nozick, (David) Friedman ...) not always consistent the one with another. 9. Hence, if S = (1, 2) and X = {a, b}, then the set X2 of issues is: {(a; 1, a; 2), (a; 1, b; 2), (b; 1, b; 2), (b; 1, a; 2)) where x = (a; 1, b; 2) means that x1 = a while x2 = b, that is 1 chooses a while 2 chooses b. 10. Notice that completeness and transitivity for preference implies reflexivity: (P2) implies (P1) since the preferences are already assumed to be complete. 11. Selfishness seems to correspond also to a natural consequence of the epistemological assumption of methodological individualism, this last being basic in modem economic theory. 12. For instance, {i} C {i} U {j} and {j} C {i} U {j}. Then, by monotonicity, q&gt;- ({i}) C q&gt;- ({i) U {j}) as well as q({j}) C q&gt;({i} U {j}), which finally means that q&gt;({i} U q-({j}) C q&gt;- ({i U {j}), i.e. for selfish preferences: {i} U {j} C q&gt;-({i} U {j}). 13. A radical conception of liberalism as proposed by Nozick (1974) consists in postulating that all decisions finally rest with individuals: the public (or societal) domain would be empty. 14. Not immediately, but in the long-run... 15. An immediate example is that of the minimum wage. If the society decides that there should be a minimum wage, this decision is public by definition but it constrains the private economic decisions of individual firms, Now, if the same society wants to decrease the public economic domain and deletes the minimum wage constraint, the society must accept that simultaneously, it can no longer protect its poorest members by that means.</page><page sequence="24">270 References Arrow, K.J.
