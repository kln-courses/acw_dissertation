<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fables of Modernity: Literature and Culture in the English Eighteenth Century by Laura Brown. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2001. Pp. xiv + 273. $39.95 cloth. It has been more than a decade since the publication of the pivotal essay collection edited by Laura Brown and Felicity Nussbaum, The New Eighteenth Century: Theory, Politics, English Literature (New York: Methuen, 1987). Yet anyone who has attended a recent meeting of the American Society for Eigh teenth-Century Studies or who has logged on to the C18-L listserv could dis cern rather quickly that the canon wars rage on here. Laura Brown's latest contribution to the field deftly negotiates this battleground by synthesizing the "old" with the "new," further entrenching her position as one of the most re spected scholars currently working in eighteenth-century literary studies. In Fables of Modernity, Brown focuses on canonical poetry and the significance of specific literary conventions in a rigorously structuralist mode, while also exploring the production and reception of cultural practices such as petkeep ing in a thoroughgoing Marxist-feminist fashion. Citing indebtedness to a breadth of critics, including Roland Barthes, Mi chel Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Stephen Greenblatt, Fredric Jameson, and Raymond Williams, Brown grounds her own work firmly in the methodology of cultural studies. Despite the listing of the requisite big boys, Brown's meth odology is also definitively feminist in its use of the concept of difference— figured through gender, race, and species—to establish the critical category of the "cultural fable" as "a means of exploring the constitution of modernity in the English eighteenth century" (1). Working with rather than challenging ex tant definitions of "modernity," Brown defies classifications of the eighteenth century as part of an "early modem" period; this too starkly separates the eigh teenth century from its entanglement with modernity, she argues. Indeed, Brown exemplifies and emphasizes the vitality and novelty of the period, in sisting that its cultural fables participated directly and dynamically in the con struction of modernity. But what exactly is a "cultural fable"? Though Brown never pins down a precise definition, she does offer some analogies and clues</page><page sequence="2">Criticism, Vol. 44, No. 3: Book Reviews 309 to what a cultural fable is not. A cultural fable does not necessarily have a di dactic function, nor does it serve as a rigid "system of classification" (2-3). Rather, Brown posits the cultural fable as a flexible analytic tool that links for mal literary conventions and print culture to specific historical phenomena. It is more expansive than some tropes, more specific than a cultural movement (such as the cult of sensibility), and similar in many ways to ideology in its impact. At the same time, it adheres to a distinct, formal structure. With its definitive structure and potentially powerful, widespread influence, the slip pery cultural fable paradoxically enables Brown to rein in what she sees as the all-too-often diffuse methodology of cultural studies. Brown achieves the goal of more coherently structuring a cultural studies methodology by invoking a multitude of authoritative textual examples that persuasively build upon and connect to each other. This is particularly true of the first two sections of the book, which concentrate on expansion and ex change by exploring the fables of the city sewer, oceans and torrents, and Lady Credit. Restoration and Augustan poetry reign here, providing Brown's pri mary locus of interpretation and exemplum of cultural fable. The pressures of urbanization, both literal and imaginative, figure in the image of the city sewer and connect heterogeneity, indiscriminancy, force, and fluidity to the experi ence of modernity via the female body. In the fable of torrents, nationalism and imperial expansion, evident in the growing shipping and trade industries, take center stage, as does Johnson's Vanity of Human Wishes (1749). Chapter three defines the fable of that mysterious, changeable, and volatile figure, Lady Credit. Here Brown makes provocative and productive connections between finance—specifically credit culture—the female body, and the emergence of the cult of sensibility through readings of various cultural texts including peri odical literature by Defoe and Addison, the discourse of hysteria, Richardson's Clarissa (1747-48), and Hume's Treatise of Human Nature (1739). The first two sections of the book culminate in an excellent explication of Pope's Dun dad (1729 and 1743), wherein all of these fables interlock and illuminate one another (in concert with the fable of commodification that harks back to Brown's previous work, Ends of Empire [Cornell University Press, 1993], which argues that imperialism is represented in a range of eighteenth-century texts as undertaken for the adornment and edification of women). In the Dun ciad, Brown suggests, a consideration of the power of capitalism to change the world consolidates in the female figure of Dulness. Perhaps because of the convincing cumulative effect of Brown's reading of the Dunciad, the final section of the book, concerned with exploring ques tions of alterity through the fables of the native prince and the nonhuman being, though perhaps the most provocative, also proves less stylistically se ductive. Here, the fables are not, to use Brown's own words, quite so "overlap ping and mutually resonant" as in the preceding sections of the book, and the</page><page sequence="3">310 Criticism, Vol. 44, No. 3: Book Reviews connection to the promise of the book's title—an exploration of moder nity—is implicit rather than explicit (43). Brown does not delve into how the negotiation of difference is a particularly modern problem; it is implicitly un derstood to be such. Brown does acknowledge that unlike the confluence of fables found in the Dunciad, the fable of the native prince, "does not analyze the modern crisis from which it draws its materials" (219). Here Brown moves away from canonical poetry to concentrate on sentimental fiction and accounts of visits from "royal" natives to London. I am never fully convinced that the fable of the native prince is a cultural fable and not just a particularly resonant trope. Perhaps this is a problem with the slippery definition of "cultural fable" more than the presentation of ideas in this chapter, because Brown offers a compelling argument that the native prince becomes an important model for and link to the sentimental European "man of feeling." It is certainly true, as Keith Thomas and others have already noted, that material and ideological connections between animals and non-Europeans, es pecially African slaves, were also common in the eighteenth century. In her final chapter, Brown argues that "[a]nimals helped Europeans imagine Afri cans, Native Americans, and themselves" (262). The encounter with different species thus provided a way to structure the encounter with cultural differ ence. Because Brown is so adept at interweaving all of her points, I was occa sionally disappointed when she dropped some potentially luminous threads in this chapter. For example, Brown notes the ways in which women, particularly African women, were repeatedly figured in European discourse as links to apes, especially as told in the ubiquitous "rape-ape" narrative, wherein a pri mate abducts a native woman. We appear to have the roots of the King Kong tale here. Yet Brown does not explore fully the gendered implications of this fable. Indeed, Brown also mentions the sexual connections between the lady and her lapdog, but ultimately these examples serve to illustrate the proximity between human and nonhuman beings rather than to illuminate particular connections between women and animality. The lacuna is notable because Brown earlier takes pains to connect representations of women's sexual energy to indiscriminancy and leveling in the fables of the city sewer and Lady Credit. Despite my wish for more, what Brown does do in this chapter marks a significant contribution to contemporary scholarship on cultural representa tions of animals. A tremendous amount of important and revealing work on how the onset of modernity has changed and shaped human attitudes toward the natural world has been undertaken in recent years. And much has been done specifically to historicize these attitudes towards animals, by, to name only a few, Keith Thomas, Erica Fudge, Kathleen Kete, and Harriet Ritvo. Re cently, a great deal of critical energy has been focused on animals in Romantic poetry in particular. My own initial investigations into the significance of lap dogs, a particularly pervasive trope in eighteenth-century literature, has</page><page sequence="4">Criticism, Vol. 44, No. 3: Book Reviews 311 evolved dramatically in recent months thanks to much of this work, and Brown's contribution to the area promises to further enrich this area of study. Indebted to Donna Haraway's notions of the pitfalls and possibilities inherent in blurring distinctions between nonhuman and human, Brown also cites reli ance upon critical interventions into the concept of anthropomorphism, spe cifically Adela Pinch's unpublished work on anti-anthropomorphism in Romantic poetry. Tension between exalting intimacy and the desire to hold species apart was manifest in representations of eighteenth-century relation ships between humans and other animals. Whereas some scholars, including Ritvo and myself, have privileged the hierarchical impulse to taxonomize here, Brown reads such ambivalence as potentially productive ambiguity. She argues that while continued adherence to "The Great Chain of Being" may appear to reinforce hierarchy and difference, it in fact emphasizes connections and con tinuity, gradations rather than strict distinctions. Brown finds that the fable of the nonhuman being appears in a wide range of texts to engage repeatedly with the idea of continuity between species by representing a "leap of affinity" between the human and nonhuman being that bridges the differential gap. Fables of Modernity is cultural studies at its best. Throughout, Brown care fully traces tropes back to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts to insist upon the distinctly eighteenth-century function and flavor of each of her fa bles. Her culturally grounded readings of texts not only elucidate their histori cal work but also their aesthetic qualities. Brown's stellar reading of the Dunciad particularly captures the tone and effect of Pope's scatological, satiri cal poem. We are told that the Dunciad provides: "A comprehensive vision of modernity that moves through and between a variety of cultural fables in an effort to engage the relations among empire, finance, expansion, commodifi cation, and reification, and to project from that synthesis a visceral sense of the transformative effects of capital upon the world" (168). Indeed, Brown's meticulously evidenced and logically interconnected analysis gives us a rich tapestry that illustrates a range of eighteenth-century cultural anxieties, values, and ideals centering on the rapidly changing conditions that mark the onset of modernity. Ultimately, she suggests that a prominent, and promising, fea ture of cultural encounters with alterity may be a recognition of affinities rather than a demarcation of differences. While Brown characterizes moder nity as distinguished by the ironic "yoking [of] . . . exploitation and liberation, brutality and progress, fears and hopes" (15), the fable of the nonhuman being interrogates the past in a Utopian impulse to re-envision a more hopeful fu ture.
