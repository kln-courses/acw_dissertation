(Craft commercialization, specialization, woodcarvingS Mexico) The commercialization of craft production is an integral part of development programs in many rural areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. State agencies and NGOs promote artisanry in an attempt to provide economic aid to rural residents whose agricultural earnings are limited by small plotsS low crop prices, and poor soils. Craft sales can enable households to meet subsistence needs and increase incomes even where land is scarce or unevenly divided. Artisanal production may provide rural men and women with an economic alternative to migration to crowded urban areas. Economic anthropologists studying craft commercialization have usually focused on changes in work organization associated with new commodity chains linking rural artisans, development organizations, wholesalers, and store owners (e.g., Nash 1993b; Steiner 1994:40-60; Tice 1995). Entrepreneurs making and marketing crafts have set up workshops with hired laborers and established putting-out systems where piece workers at home use materials provided by merchantsg Such changes have led arlthropologists (e.g., Cook 1993; Kearney 1996:165-69; Stephen 1991) to write about the extent to which rural artisans are able to maintain autonomy as they become increasingly integrated into a global economy. Few economic anthropologists, however, have carefully examined the product differentiation that ordinarily accompanies craft commercialization. Rural artisans selling crafts typically innovate and develop specialties in their attempts to establish niches for themselves in a complex economic environment. The market segmentation associated with increased artisan sales resembles the later stages of product life cycles described in the business literature and is somewhat analogous to the proliferation of equilibrium species in mature or climax stages of ecological succession. 225 ETHNOLOGY vol. 39 no. 3, Summer 2000, pp. 22542.

Some make expensive, labor-intensive carvings for collectors; others churn out cheap pieces for giiFt shops in the United States and for tourists seeking souvenirs. Artisans vary in their painting and carving styles and the size of their pieces. They make animals, human flguresS devils, angels, frames, chairs, tables, and ox carts. I have seen carvings of Benito Juarez, subcomandante Marcos (the Zapatista leader), chupacabras (imaginary beings that eat goats), Martians," mermaids, and helicopters. The diverse economic strategies carvers have pursued in recent years are the result of a segmented market in the United States and Mexico that promotes novelty and rewards specialization. Artisans do not, however, have total freedom in their initiatives. They are constrained by their skills and the labor and capital they are able to mobilize. MARKET DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION, AND EVOLUTION Economic development in capitalist societies almost by deflnition involves attracting customers to new products and expanding the market for already existing products. Makers and sellers of an increasingly popular product often develop specialties in their efforts to gain a share of the market. Models from two very different fields, market research and ecological succession, may improve our understanding of why such product differentiation sometimes accompanies economic growth. Neither of these models precisely fits the evolution of market niches in the trade in Oaxacan woodcarvings Nonetheless, an examination of these models provides insights into the reasons why many carving households have become increasingly specialized in recent years. Prodact Life Cycles Market researchers (e.g., Capron 1978; Onkvisit and Shaw 1989) have shown that successful products such as automobiles cameras, and audiotapes ordinarily have certain life cycles. These business-oriented writers usually assume that their units of analysis are the firms making these products. The applicability of the product life- cycle model to Oaxacan woodcarvers therefore depends in part on the extent to which the various groups making pieces can be regarded as analogous to flrms. The product life-cycle model has Elve stages. Sales build slowly during the Elrst stage of product introduction. The second stage is early growth, characterized by rapidly increasing sales. Sales continue tO increase during late growth, but at a lower rate. The Elnal two stages are maturity, when sales are relatively constant, and decline, when sales decrease until the product is Elnally withdrawn from the market. During introduction there are usually only a few pioneers making the product. The increased sales marking the end of the introductory phase attract competitors,</page><page sequence="3">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 227 who continue to enter the market through the early growth stage. Because sales come Eom the growth in the market this is not a stage of intense competition. During the late growth phase competition heats up as the market begins to stabilize. The number of flrms selling the product decreases as the strong force out the weak. The late growth period is characterized by product differentiation and market segmentation: In contrast to the imitative product strategy of early growth, extensive product modification occurs as competitors seek differential advantage through product design. Typically, product variations proliferate as competitors adapt their products to specific customer requirements.... In contrast to the early growth phase, price becomes a major competitive weapon in late growth. (Capron 1978:5) Market segmentation is an attempt to divide markets into groups of potential customers with similar characteristics with respect to purchasing (Berrigan and Finkbeiner 1992; Weinstein 1987). By making products designed to appeal to particular types of customers, segmenters hope to increase their sales. The maturity stage begins when sales cease to grow. During this phase most sales are to repeat users and prices are competitive. Although the maturity stage may last many years, sales eventually decrease. Two common reasons why declines occur are technological obsolescence and changing consumer tastes. Ecological Saccession Suggestive parallels can be drawn between product life cycles and stages of ecological succession as plants invade open f1elds (Burrows 1990:420-64; Colinvaux 1973:549-72). The Elrst plants in such fields are opportunists, selected for their unspecialized behavior, plastic physiology, and expensive means of widespread dispersion. In the absence of signiflcant disturbances, opportunists are gradually replaced by equilibrium species with specialized physiologies and stereotyped responses. As the environment becomes more crowded and more predictable, natural selection favors specialized adaptations to small econiches. This leads to a great increase in the number of species in the later stages of succession. Comparisons of the changing economic strategies of Oaxacan artisans and the ecological succession stages of plants occupying an open field are clearly limited in scope. The applicability of a succession model depends in part on the extent to which analogies can be drawn between the selection pressures on production units making woodcarvings in an expanding market and those affecting plant species in a recently formed ecosystem. Such analogies have at least surface plausibility. The development of specializations by Oaxacan woodcarvers and many other artisans is a textbook example of a cultural evolutionary process (Chibnik 1981; Durham 1990). Artisans continually try out new styles in their efforts to increase sales. Some experiments are unsuccessful (do not attract buyers) and are abandoned. Other innovations are selected (attract customers) and replicated and become part of the cultural repertory of particular families and communities.</page><page sequence="4">228 ETHNOLOGY The ecological succession and market research analogies both suggest that artisans will adopt opportunistic or generalist economic strategies in the introductory and early growth stages of a product life cycle. The models also both imply that artisans will specialize in the late growth stage as they compete for customers in a crowded, more predictable market. The analogies diverge, however, in their implications concerning the number of competitors in the late growth stage. The market research model suggests that there will be fewer competitors as slower growth leads to more intense selective pressures. The succession analogy, in contrast, implies that there will be more competitors as niches are established in a stable economic environment. ARTISANRY AND DEVELOPMENT IN MEXICO Mexico has long been known for the diverse crafts made by indigenous artisans living in rural areas. The state has energetically promoted such artisanry since the famous Revolution in the early twentieth century. Politicians and intellectuals in the 1920s and 1930s encouraged folkloric crafts as part of their efforts to develop symbols of national identity (Garcia Canclini 1993:43). Postrevolutionary ideology aimed at the creation of a mestizo Mexico that incorporated indigenous groups into the state and emphasized both Amerindian and European roots of national culture. The state established museums of Zpopular arts and industriesb and sponsored traveling craft exhibitions. To this day, the government regards crafts as serving an important ideological function. In parts of Mexico with large numbers of speakers of indigenous languages, the state encourages an ethnic identity based on craiFt sales in national museum outlets and bazaars sponsored by regional artisan institutes (Nash 1993a: 1 1). Since the 1940s, the Mexican government has incorporated craft promotion into economic development programs. The state sponsors contests for artisans and runs stores that buy and sell crafts from all over the country. Tourist offices prominently display the products of local artisans in their brochures. Regional and national agencies aid the production and marketing of crafts. Transportation improvements in Mexico in the past half century have led to a great increase in foreign tourism. Although many visitors seek what they regard as traditional craStsS merchants have learned that tourists are also willing to buy "folk" artisanry that does not have longstanding cultural signiElcance. Precolumbian motifs appear on pottery jewelry, and wallets. Skirts, jackets, and blouses made of local textiles bear patterns invented in the twentieth century. Some merchants design new items and hire urban workers to make themo Others encourage innovation among the many talented artisans in the . countryslc e. The promotion of artisanry in rural areas has been spurred by worsening agricultural conditions ln much of Mexico. Many families are unable to earn significant incomes from farming their small plots. Garcia Canclini (1993:39) nicely summarizes the appeal of crafts to development agencies:</page><page sequence="5">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 229 Given the impoverished and seasonal nature of agricultural production, crafts emerge as a suitable additional resource, and in some villages they become the major source of income. Without requlring large investments in raw materials, machines, or the training of a skilled labor force, they increase the earnings of rural families through the employment of women, children, and men during periods of economic inactivity. The state also regards the development of crafts as a way to stem the flood of migrants from rural areas. Because most crafts have a limited market, artisanry in rural Mexican communi- ties is ordinarily not a particularly proEltable supplement to agriculture and wage labor. In a few places (Stephen 1991; Stromberg 1976), the sales of crafts have been high enough to allow families to improve their standard of living significantly. In such cases, many people have abandoned farming and wage labor and now work full time as makers or sellers of crafts. OAXACAN WOODCARVING I examine here the development of specializations in Arrazola, San Martin Tilcajete, and La Union Tejalapan, three well-known woodcarving towns near the city of Oaxaca. About 1,700 people live in San Martin; Arrazola and La Union each have approximately one thousand inhabitants. Many households in these communities have prospered by selling brightly painted, whimsical pieces to wholesalers and store owners from the United States. Woodcarving in Arrazola, San Martin, and La Union does not fit the stereotypical portrait of a Mexican craft in two important respects. First, the carvers are monolingual in Spanish and are not identified by themselves or others as Indians.2 Second, the woodcarvings are novel creations without long- standing cultural significance. The woodcarving boom originated in the activities of Oaxaca-based shop owners and three particular carvers Manuel Jimenez of Arrazola, Isidoro Cruz of San Martin, and Martin Santiago of La Union. Jimenez, born in 1919, began carving wooden figures as a boy to pass time while tending animals. He sold a few carvings in the Oaxaca marketplace over the years. Inthe late 1950s and early 1960s, owners of craft shops in Oaxaca began buying Jimenez's carvings and showing them to folk- art collectors such as Nelson Rockefeller. By the late 1960s, Jimenez was exhibiting in museums in Mexico City and the United States. Tourists and collectors started to visit Jimenez's workshop in Arrazola during the 1970s. The master kept his techniques secret and for a long time the only carvers in Arrazola were Jimenez, his sons, and a son-in-law. In the early 1980s, however, other carvers in Arrazola began offering pieces for sale to people visiting Jimenez. Isidoro Cruz was thirteen years old when he learned to carve during a long illness in 1947. While Cruz was working as an ox-cart maker in the city of Oaxaca in 1968, he met Tonatiuh Gutierrez, who worked for the National Council of Expositions. Gutierrez hired Cruz to buy pieces for the council and encouraged him to sell his own carvings, which included animals, clowns, and masks. Cruz did not</page><page sequence="6">230 ETHNOLOGY hide his methods and about ten men in San Martln began to carve various types of wooden figures. In 1970, Gutierrez became head of a government agency aimed at increasing craft sales. He named Cruz head of the agency's buying office in Oaxaca in 1971. During the four years Cruz ran the buying office, he was able to purchase many carvings from his friends and neighbors. Between 1952 and 1967, Martln Santiago made seven trips to the United States, where he worked as an agricultural laborer in California, ArizonaS and Texas After the U.S.-Mexican agreement (the bracero program) which had sponsored Santiago's seasonal agricultural migration endedS he found that wage labor and subsistence farming provided meager support for his growing family. In 1967, Santiago began selling woodcarvings to a shop owner in Oaxaca who had stopped buying from Jimenez after a complex dispute. Santiago taught his four brothers how to make wood H1gures and for many years the only carvers in La Union were members of his large extended family. In the 1970s and early 1980sS carvers in the three villages sold their pieces mostly to store owners in Oaxaca. Only Jimenez supported his family primarily by making wood figures; other carvers earned more from farming and wage labor. Woodcarving during this time was a part-time occupation for a few adult males; women and children only occasionally worked on pieces. In the mid-1980s, wholesalers and store owners from the United States began to buy directly from carvers in Arrazola, San Martin, and La Union. The weakening peso had made trading Mexican folk art more lucrative for dealers for the United States. By 1990 most households in Arrazola and San Martin earned part of their income from the sale of carvings. Because artisans in La Uni6n were less successful in attracting dealers and tourists, woodcarving households remained a minority. As sales from woodcarvings soared, the organization of work changed (Chibnik In press). Male carvers asked their wives and children to help with painting and sanding.3 Carving 4uickly became a family activity in which adult men contributed less than half the total labor. Some families in Arrazola and San Martln found that they could not fill large orders using only household labor and hired one or two workers to help with carving painting, and sanding.4 In Arrazola there are several Wfactoriest (fabricas) that produce woodcarvings with hired workers. In San Martfn, a growing number of households buy unpainted carvings trucked in from elsewhere. After these figures are painted, they are sold to local intermediaries and international wholesalerso Although I otien refer here to individual carvers, most artisans make their pieces in work groupse While these groups most often cons1st of related family members living together in a householdS other forms of work organization involving hired laborers and piece work are also common. Unfortunately? everyone in the woodcarving trade-artisans, wholesalers, shop owners and tourists-ordinarily refers to pieces as being the work of a single person, typically an adult man. This is exemplif1ed by the signatures on pieces, which usually carry only the name of the principal male carver.</page><page sequence="7">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 231 REASONS FOR SPECIALIZATION Specialization in the woodcarving trade is the result of both market demands and the initiative of artisans. Buyers of woodcarvings include collectors seeking original, beautifillly painted pieces, tourists purchasing inexpensive souvenirs, merchants stocking ethnic arts shops, and wholesalers searching for items that can be sold in enormous gift shows. These different kinds of buyers, with their own tastes, seek both items they know about and those they have never seen before. The woodcarvers therefore try to increase their sales by doing something distinctive that is attractive to some, but not all, buyers. In so doing, they hope to create a demand for new types . 0t carvlngs. The increased specialization in carving over the years cannot be neatly separated from overall changes in styles. Prior to 1980, most carvings bore clear relevance to the natural, cultural, and spiritual world of the artisans. Many carvings were of human figures (e.g., farmers, old men), ox teams, animals from the Oaxaca region, devils, angels, and skeletons. These pieces, now referred to as zrustic" (rustico), were carved and painted in a simple, albeit charming manner. As more dealers visited the woodcarving villages, artisans developed new styles in their efforts to attract clients. Animal carvings (sometimes of nonindigenous fauna such as zebras, lions, and elephants) sold the best and came to dominate the trade. Water-based aniline paints gave way to house paints that did not run as much and were less likely to fade in the sun. Carvings became more complicated and painting more ornate as families competed to show their skills. Because some buyers prefer the older styles of carving and painting, a signiflcant market remains for rustic pieces. Most contemporary artisans in La Union specialize in modified versions of these simpler carvings, sometimes painted with aniline. Moreover, many buyers, especially those interested in Day of the Dead motifs, still seek out saints, angels, devils, and skeletons. Thus, some specialization is actually the continued production of ztraditional" (twenty-year-old!) pieces. The diversification of woodcarvings in Arrazola, San Martin, and La Union began with experiments by Manuel Jimenez, Isidoro Cruz, and Martin Santiago. These early woodcarvers attempted to increase their incomes by selling a variety of pieces. Before 1970, however, the small number of woodcarvers and buyers limited the development of market niches in which individual artisans and wholesalers specialized in the production and purchase of particular types of pieces. Specialization did not really get underway until the early 1970s, when various state agencies promoting artisanry held woodcarving contests in Oaxaca and bought the pieces of many entrants. These contests encouraged woodcarvers to try new pieces in efforts to win prizes and sell their pieces to the state. This stimulated a florescence of new styles in San Martin in particular because of Isidoro Cruz's connections with state bureaucracies promoting artisanry. The establishment of some new crafts stores in the city of Oaxaca at this time also encouraged woodcarvers to innovate.</page><page sequence="8">232 ETHNOLOGY The astonishing diversity of pieces and styles that characterizes the contemporary woodcarving trade did not develop until the mid-1980s, when increasing numbers of wholesalers, store owners, and tourists from the United States visited Arrazola and San Martin. Many villagers who previously had shown little interest in artisanry began to make woodcarvings. These neophyte carvers needed some way to attract dealers and tourists on their way to the houses of established artisans such as Jose Hernandez in Arrazola and Epifanio Fuentes and Justo Xuana in San Martin. The obvious solution was to make something different that would appeal to potential buyers. The lack of longstanding traditions in the woodcarving trade encourages experimentation. Some Oaxacan crafts such as Atzompa pottery and embroidered wedding dresses from San Antonino (Waterbury 1989) are so well established that variability is restricted to rather fixed, culturally defined limits.5 Buyers search for craft items they consider typical of a particular place. Because there are no long- established woodcarving styles, buyers have fewer preconceived notions about what they are looking for and are more receptive to new types of pieces. Wholesalers and store owners want to diversify their stock; tourists like having something unique that will impress their friends and relatives. In recent years certain styles of carving and painting have become regarded as typical of particular families and communities as wholesalers and store owners seek out pieces and artisans that have sold well in the past. Margarito Melchor of San Martin has prospered for years by selling cats similar to those found on the cover of a popular book about the woodcarvers (Barbash 1993; Chibnik 1999). Maria Jimenez and her brothers make spectacular saints and angels in San Martin, while Juan Carlos Santiago of Arrazola is sought out for his penguins. Arrazola carvers are known for their elaborately curved, one-piece iguanas; La Uni6n artisans make multipiece rodeos, fiestas, and nativity scenes. The fundamental appeal of the carvings, however, is still based on characteristics that encourage experimentation by artisans. Craft dealers whom I have interviewed in the United States and Mexico agree that customers especially appreciate the whimsy, color, and imagination of the carvings. When artisans are successful with a particular kind of carving (e.g., frogs reading books, parrot musicians, reclining cats), some of their neighbors copy their styles in cheaperS less technically proficient knockoffs. A type of figure once regarded as original, whimsical, and imaginative may come to seem hackneyed. Successful artisans are well aware of this process and sometimes complain about copiers. Their realization that the market can become saturated with particular kinds of pieces forces them to either innovate or develop specialties (e.g., difficult painting or carving styles) that cannot be easily copied. Even Margarito Melchor, who is an archetypal example of an artisan with a recognized, long-lasting specialty, was experimenting in the summer of 1998 with "rustic-lookingX devils angels, and witches that are quite different from his well- known, ornately painted cats, deer, goats, and squirrels. The cheapness of materials also encourages experimentation. Artisans spend no more than two or three pesos for the paint and wood needed for a medium-sized carving which can be sold to a dealer</page><page sequence="9">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 233 for 30 or 40 pesos. Because several such pieces can be completed in a dayS making something new requires minimal expenditures of time and money. If an experiment fails (a new type of carving is not bought), little is lost. Carvers' abilities limit their freedom to experiment. Skilled, imaginative artisans typically innovate by making expensive, elaborately carved pieces with complex painting designs. Less talented carvers are more likely to experiment by making smaller, cheaper, less complicated and slightly different versions of other people's successiful ideas. Innovation is also constrained by the labor and capital available to particular carvers. Artisans with large families or the money to hire workers can afford to experiment with several new pieces while simultaneously making carvings that have sold well in the past. This economic strategy is not available to an impoverished artisan couple with young children. Because of their precarious economic circumstances and small labor pool, such a couple may be reluctant to innovate much. TYPES OF SPECIALIZATION Although Oaxacan woodcarvings most obviously differ in what they represent, they also vary in size, color, painting style, materials, price, and many other characteristics. Carvers' specializations typically eneompass some combination of these variables. A carving family might, for example, make many expensive iguanas painted with particular decorations. Most artisans have several specializations. Coindo Melchor of San Martin carves elaborate ox teams (two bulls, a driver, and a cart filled with animals and crops) and unique creatures that one writer (Barbash 1993:31) has described as abird-headed women. Aguilino Garcfa of La Union sells fairly expensive skunks, crocodiles, armadillos, and palm trees. Antonio Aragon of Arrazola makes medium-priced, small, finely carved, realistic deer, dogs lions, and cats. Despite such specializations, all carvers can and do make a wide variety of pieces and will readily change their product mix if what they are concentrating on declines in popularity. What follows mentions only the most important ways in which carvings vary. These are 1) representations, 2) physical characteristics, 3) carving and painting styles, and 4) price. Representations Carvings can roughly be classified into flve categories; animals religious or folkloric beings, humans plants, and inanimate objects. Some carvings (e.g., trees with birdss drunks sitting on chairs around a table) include items from two or more of these categories. A few (e.g.? skulls masks) do not fit neatly into my classifica- tory scheme. Animals are by far the most common carvings. An examination of the purchases of a large-scale dealer between 1995 and 1998 revealed that he had bought more than</page><page sequence="10">234 ETHNOLOGY 70 different types of animals. The dealer spent the most money on cats; other frequent purchases included armadillos, ffogs iguanas, porcupines, donkeys, and giraffes. Animals are often painted with bright colors and designs and carved with exaggerated features that bear little resemblance to what occurs in the natural world. Anthropomorphism is common and carvings of animals playing musical instrumentsS golfing, fishing and engaging in other human pursuits are very popular. Many carvings depict religious or folkloric beings important in Mexican popular culture. Angels, saintsS and virgins tend to be somber, if often brightly painted pieces depicted alone. Devils and skeletons, in contrast, are oiFten parts of lively scenes. There are fsor example, ox carts H1lled with skeletons, devils riding dogs and skeletons drinking with witches. Artisans often make mermaids and occasionally carve other mythical figures such as centaurs and Pegasuses. The most common carvings of imaginary beings, howevers are alebrijes (often spelled "alebrigest'). These fantastic flgures sometimes described as "space aget are modeled on the papier mache sculptures of the Linares family of Mexico City, who are said to have coined the term Walebrije" (Masuoka 1994:97). Because many buyers now use "alebrije" to refer to any Oaxacan woodcarving, artisans are beginning to refser to the space-age pieces as marcianos (Martians). Carvings of human beings evidently do not sell well since they are only occasionally made. I have seen striking carvings of old men, farmers, drunks, mariachis, fruit vendors, cooks, lovers, and prostitutes. Despite their originality and charm, such carvings are made mostly by older artisans in La Union and seem much less popular than they once were. The artisans carve many trees and cacti. The only other flora that artisans commonly make are fruits and vegetables such as avocados, chilesS watermelons, and carrots. Carvings of inanimate objects include those that are purely decorative (e.g., bicycles, wheels of fortune) and those that have some practical use (e.g., jewelry boxes? refrigerator magnetsS napkin holders). The most commonly made inanimate objects are picture frames decorated with raised carvings of animals and plants. Brightly painted miniature chairs and tables are also popular and are often sold to Mexican tourists as children9s toys. Physical Characteristics Most carvings are made from copal a light wood that is easily cut when wet and hard after drying. Some carvers specialize by making some or all of their carvings out of other types of wood. Chairs, tables frames and magnets are usually made from plne. Zompantle (Erythrina coralloides) is used by a few carvers ln San Martin, notably Isidoro Cruz. Manuel Jimenez and his sons nowadays carve only in cedar. In the late 1980s, carvers could be divided into those who used aniline and those who were switching to vinyT-acrylic house paints. Nowadays. aniline is only used by Isidoro Cruz of San Martfn and some carvers from the extended Santiago family of La Union.</page><page sequence="11">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 235 Aside from materials, the most obvious physical way that carvings vary is in their size. While big carvings are more striking, smaller pieces have the important advantage of being more easily transported by tourists. Big pieces ordinarily take longer to make and can be sold for higher prices. They are typically bought by collectors and store owners wanting something flashy to highlight a shop area. Smaller pieces, which comprise the bulk of the trade, are sold to diverse types of buyers; tourists, shop owners stocking cheap giift items, and wholesalers selling to retailers in the United States. Skilled carvers whose reputations and contacts attract buyers willing to spend some money tend to spend most of their time on medium- sized and big pieces. Most, however, make some small pieces (e.g., pigs by Maria Jimenez and her brothers) and a few (e.g., Sergio Aragon of Arrazola) specialize in miniatures. Carvings can be subdivided into individual pieces and multipiece sets. Although every carver makes individual pieces, some specialize in particular types of sets, such as animal musician bands, Nativity scenes, rodeos, fiestas, kiosks, and anthropomor- phic animals sitting on chairs around a table filled with food and drink. Artisans are usually willing to sell parts of a set to an interested customer. The only reason that they will refuse to do this is if the set has already been ordered by someone else and the buyer is expected to pick it up soon. Carving and Painting Styles Artisans often attempt to develop unique styles that demonstrate technical ability, attract prospective customerss and cannot be copied easily. This may entail co- operation and consultation between a husband and wife since the most common division of labor involves men carving and women painting. My impression, however, is that carvers and painters have considerable autonomy in their creative efforts. Moreover, stylistic specialization does not occur only at the individual and family level. Some carving and painting styles are now characteristic of related households or even entire communities. Carvers' technical ability can greatly increase the value of their pieces. Carvings of animals ordinarily include a body and some attachments. The body of the carving of a lion, for instance, includes its torso, head, and legs, with ears and a tail as attachments. Artisans often demonstrate their skill by making complex bodies out of one piece of wood. This is most evident in the curving iguanas characteristic of numerous Arrazola carvers. Conversely, the rusticity of some La Union cats can be seen in their multipiece bodies with legs nailed onto torsos. When carvers judge the skill of one another, they most often look at the details in a figure. Some rustic animal carvings, which often have considerable charm, only crudely represent legs and do not realistically indicate posture. Talented carvers will accurately show an animal's movement and carefully delineate toes and claws. A carving I bought of a "woman of the streetsX by Gabino Reyes of La Union</page><page sequence="12">236 ETHNOLOGY illustrates well what a skilled artisan can do. This small piece includes palnted fingernails, a decorated short skirt, and a precisely rendered purse. Painting offers more opportunity for specialization than carving and artisans vary greatly in the colors and designs they use. Some painters can be readily identifled, for example by the types of eyes on their animal carvings. Both low-end and high- end artisans have developed characteristic painting styles. La Union rustic pieces are often painted simply with one or two colors and few decorations. Equally cheap pieces from workshops in Arrazola are elaborately painted with a particular design that is readily identifiable. The painting styles of the La Union rustic pieces and the Arrazola workshop carvlngs are easy to learn. The decorations used by Mar1a Jimenez of San Martfn on her expensive pieces, in contrast, indicate a remarkable talent. Maria, the best-known painter in the carving villages, uses minute, detailed, repetitive decorations on saints, angels, toucans, and pigs carved by her five brothers. Maria says that she has about 30 designs that she has developed for painting carvings. These designs are related to decorative patterns Maria learned earlier when making embroidered dresses. Price The woodcarving market is segmented by price into three general categories. Artisans sold their cheapest pieces for 50 pesos or less in June 1998, when the exchange rate was 8.8 pesos per dollar. Medium-priced pieces sold from 50 to 200 pesos; expensive pieces mostly cost between 200 and 1,000 pesos. The priciest carvings regularly sold are made by high-end Arrazola carvers such as Jose Hernandez, Miguel Santiago Francisco Morales, and Manuel Jimenez. Although a collector paid 9,000 pesos in Arrazola for a carving in the summer of 1998, only a few other pieces sold locally for more than 2,000 pesos. The highest-priced piece from a carving village that I know of was sold in 1995, when a doctor from Mexico City paid Isidoro Cruz the equivalent of US$3,000 for a carousel of the Americas. Cruz had spent three months working on this spectacular carving. Price differences reflect a segmented market in the United States and Mexico (and less significantly Canada? Europe and Japan), where some buyers seek out inexpensive carvings for gifts and souvenirs, others clever, medium-priced pieces, and still others expensive, one-of-a-kind carvings. This differentiated market could easily be seen in Santa Fe, New Mexico? in May 1998. An enormous store called Jackalope sold hundreds of cheap carvings at prices ranging from $15 to $100. The fiont window of a smaller shop on the main square displayed a $755 lion carved by Maximillano Morales of Arrazola (Francisco Morales's son). A clerk in the store said that they had no problem selling carvings at this price.6 Although all artisans make pieces that vary considerably in cost, most focus on a certain price range. The most extreme example is Manuel Jimenez, whose cheapest pieces (priced only in dollars) sell for US$100. A more typical case is Aguilino Garcia of La Uni6n, who slowly makes pieces that sold for between 100 and 400</page><page sequence="13">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 237 pesos ($12 to $45) in the summer of 1998. There are many artisan families whose business comes primarily from small animal carvings sold to dealers for about US$3 apiece. Artisans can only choose to a limited extent whether they will specialize in cheap, medium-priced, or expensive pieces. Obviously not all artisans are able to command high prices for their work. Because expensive pieces (which are often large) generally take a long time to make, carvers can specialize in them only if they are sure that they will f1nd buyers. This depends on the artisans' ability to make original, technically proficient pieces and whether they have an established reputation. Nonetheless, a certain amount of specialization with respect to price is possible. The owners of the workshops in Arrazola have made a conscious decision, for exampleS to make inexpensive pieces marketed to tourists. Some skilled artisarl families in Arrazola and San Mart1n who have the ability to make expensive pieces have chosen instead to mainly make medium-priced pieces. They prefer the quicker, surer returns that these smaller carvings provide. EXAMPLES OF SPECIALIZATION The four brief case studies that follow show some of the ways in which Oaxacan woodcarvers specialize. The artisans profiled vary in the types of carvings they make the prices of their pieces, and the kinds of customers they have. The case studies also illustrate the diverse types of labor organization used to make pieces. They include one artisan working mostly alone two families, and a workshop with hired laborers. ensive Pieces fior Collectors Miguel Santiago of Arrazola, born in 1966, sells perhaps 40 woodcarvings a year to about 35 different customers. Some of these sales are of individual pieces; others are multipiece sets with both human and animal figures (e.g.? Frida Kahlo surrounded by monkeys). Miguel's carvings (or sets) typically cost between $300 and $800. Although Miguel has sold to buyers from Mexico, Europe, and Japan, most of his customers come from the United States. He is a versatile artisan who can and will make almost anything a client requestsX His specialty can best be described as exceptionally well-madeS original, expensive carvings. Miguel works slowly and carefully and often spends more than a month on an order for a multipiece set. Miguel, whose work methods resemble those of an architect, has orders for two years in advance. After potential customers suggest ideas for a carving, Miguel makes several sketches of possible pieces. Eventually an agreement is reached about what will be made and the delivery date. Miguel sends a price estimate to his client about five months before the carving is due. The price may be raised later if Miguel decides to modify his original idea.</page><page sequence="14">238 ETHNOLOGY Miguel is unusual in his willingness to discuss the aesthetics of woodcarving. His strong ideas ahout what is good artisanry have made it difflcult for Miguel to work with others. He once made pieces with a talented brother, but they parted company hecause of artistic differences. Miguel later took on an 1 8-year-old nephew as a quasi apprentice, but they too had a falling out. Miguel nowadays carves alongside his father. Jose Santiago learned to carve in the mid-1980s after a motorcycle accident and a bout of appendicitis forced him to quit working as a mason. Miguel's pride in his work has led to an unusually explicit division of labor between father and son. The Santlagos are an enterprise with three product lines -ultraexpensive pieces designed carved, and painted by Miguel, expensive pieces ($80-$100) carved by Jose and painted by Miguel, and moderately priced pieces ($35-$50) carved and painted by Jose. Signatures on these pieces indicate the carver and painter. Inexpensive Pieces for Intermediaries Reynalde Santiago and Elodia Reyes have made carvings together in La Union since their marriage in the mid-1970s. Reynaldo is from an artisan family and has always supported himself by carving and small-scale farming. He is the nephew of Martin Santiago, the first carver in La Union. Elodia and Reynaldo have two daughters in their twenties and two sons a teenager and a toddler. Although many teenagers and young adults work in the woodcarving trade, Elodia and Reynaldo receive no help from their children. One daughter works as a domestic servant in Mexico City; the other is married and is husy with her own family in La Union. The teenage son works in the city of Oaxaca and has so far shown no interest in carving. The limited labor available tO Reynaldo and Elodia forces them to work slowly. Reynaldo does all the carving, while Elodia is responsible for most painting. Reynaldo says that he helps with painting when he has the time. Reynaldo and Elodia make sc)me expensive pieces such as bandstands and ox teams that sell tor $45. They also make some medium-sized (twenty-centimeter-high) animals that cost about $7. The family specializes, however, in miniature (seven- centimeter) dogs cats! giraffes, rabbits and goats that sell for about $3. Elodia once used aniline paints, but switched to house paints around 1985 at the request of Henry Wangemans a dealer who bought many of the family's pieces at that time. Because few tourists visit La Uni6n? Elodia and Reynaldo sel1 most of their pieces to Oaxaca st(3re owners and wholesalers from the United States. They have always been dependent on only a few huyers. Their first pieces were sold to Casa Victor, a store in Oaxaca. When Henry Wangeman began coming to La Union in the 1980s he was by far their most important customer. Nowadays, they sell the majority of their carvings to two clients, a wholesaler in California and a store owner in Texas.</page><page sequence="15">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 239 Inexpensive and Medium-Priced Pieces for Tourists and Wholesalers The woodcarving trade has created a niche for female entrepreneurs in Arrazola. Olga Santiago born in 1969, is one of four women in that village who run workshops in which hired laborers paint and carve pieces. All of these businesses have considerable turnover as the mostly young carvers and painters leave to work on their own. Two of these women are married and work independent of their husbands. Olga is one of two single female entrepreneurs. Although Olga's workshop is one of the newest and smallest in Arrazola, she is having considerable success. When Olga was 21, she began working as a painter in the f1rst woodcarving factory in Arrazola. This business, run by Olga's cousin, Pepe Santiago, and his wife, Mercedes Cruz, employs teenage painters and carvers who are paid a weekly salary. In 1995, Olga and an older sister stopped working for Pepe and Mercedes and established their own business in which they paid painters and carvers by the piece. Olga has run this workshop alone since her sister left for the United States in the summer of 1997. The workshop, near the house that Olga shares with her parents, is a large cement room packed with shelves of woodcarvings. In February 1998, there were three women who painted in the workshop; Olga, her seventeen-year-old niece, Anali Rodriguez, and her twenty-year-old friend and neighbor, Lourdes Morales. A fourth woman painted for Olga at home. Many pieces sold in the workshop were carved by 24-year-old Pedro Hernandez of Arrazola, who worked almost full time for Olga. Others were carved by artisans from other communities. Because Olga's workshop is located a few blocks away from Arrazola's plaza, tourists visiting Oaxaca are unlikely to find her place on their own. Olga therefore pays commissions to boys from Arrazola and guides and taxi drivers from Oaxaca who take tourists to her workshop. The prices Olga charges, while much cheaper than those for comparable pieces in the United States, are high by local standards. A small piece of poorer quality than Reynaldo and Elodia's $3 miniature animals sells for $5; medium-sized pieces of middling quality cost as much as $20. Prices are negotiable and tourists can pay considerably less if they are willing and able to bargain. Although tourists comprise a sizable part of Olga's business, wholesalers are more important customers. One particular Mexican wholesaler buys more from Olga than all tourists combined. On a May 1998 trip to the Arizona-Mexico border I saw many pieces signed zOIga Santiago.- Prices in both Mexico and the United States were double or triple those in Arrazola. Pine Carvings for Mexican Wholesalers Alba MatiasS born in 1969, is from a large carving family in San Mart1n that specializes in pine frames, chairs, tables, and magnets. Alba learned to carve and paint at an early age and worked in the family business until she married Victor</page><page sequence="16">240 ETHNOLOGY Victoria in 1995. Victor's family at that time was one of relatively few in San Martfn not involved in carving. His father, Lufs, is a building contractor and Victor worked in construction in the city of Oaxaca hefore his marriage. After Alba and Victor were married, they moved in with Victor's parents and his teenage sister, Leticia. The couple quickly established a successful family woodcarving business, making pieces similar to those of the Matias family. Alba taught Victor how to carve and paint and is still more knowledgeable about techniques than he is. The family makes pine crosses and (decorative, nonfunctional) machetes as well as frames, chairs tables, and magnets. They also make ox teams in which the animals are copal and the ox cart is pine. Alba and Victor carve and paint, Leticia paints, and Victor's mother Francisca sands. Because Alba knew many wholesalers through her family she and Victor had no trouble finding customers when they began working together. Their pieces range in price from $4 for a small frame to $100 for a small table with two chairs. They sell many medium-sized frames for $6 and also do well with $30 chairs. Perhaps because transporting chairs and tables to the United States by air is costly, most of the wholesalers buying from Alba and Victor are Mexican. Although these Mexican dealers account for the bulk of the couple9s sales, they occasionally sell to tourists and high-end Oaxaca shopse DISCUSSION Several aspects of the Oaxacan woodcarving trade encourage innovation and specialization. Because woodcarving is a new craft, buyers have few preconceived notions about what pieces should look like. The low cost of materials makes it easy for artisans to experiment without losing their livelihoods. The existence of a sizable high-end market enables some skilled carvers and painters to earn substantial incomes by spending considerable amounts of time on comm1ssioned, individualized pieces. Despite these particular features of the woodcarving trade, general theories about the causes of specialization are clearly relevant to the evolution of market niches in the worleshops of Arrazola, San Mart1n, and La Union. The product life-cycle model HItS well most of the changes in woodcarvers' economic strategies. After a long introductory stage involving a few pioneers (1950-1984), many families began carving during an early growth phase (1985-1990). The woodcarving trade is now at either the end of late growth or the beginning of maturity. As sales have leveled off and the market has become more predictable, carvers have developed niches. This specialization has reduced competition among artisans and allowed them to capture parts of a segmented marketo The number of carvers has not dimlnished during late growth, as the product life- cycle model would predict. There are three principal reasons why prosperous woodcarvers have not driven their less successful neighbors out of business. As noted earlier, the product life-cycle model assumes that the units of analysis are firms. Most carvlng production units, however, are family workshops which can survive</page><page sequence="17">MARKET NICHES IN OAXACAN WOODCARVING 241 economically in situations where labor costs would lead to the failure of capitalistic HIrms using paid employees (Chayanov 1966). Furthermore, the absence of attractive economic alternatives makes struggling artisans reluctant to abandon woodcarving. Finally, woodcarvers can easily change specializations if their initial efforts to find a market niche are unsuccessiFul. While the product life-cycle model clearly applies in part to the woodcarving trade, the relevance of theories about plant succession stages is less obvious. An ecological analogy, howevers has the merit of drawing attention to the selective pressures affecting the evolution of market niches. Specialized plants proliferate when their ecosystem becomes crowded and predictable. Although I would not wish to push this analogy too far, the woodcarvers seem to be creating more market niches as the number of artisans increases and their economic environment becomes more stable. Recent trends in the woodcarving trade may lead to further specialization and innovation. In the past several years, some carvers have prospered by selling expensive pieces to dealers. Many low-end specialists working with wholesalers have been able to earn steady, if unspectacular incomes. Some artisans who sell unoriginal, inexpensive pieces to tourists, in contrast, have suffered economically as the number of visitors to the woodcarving communities has leveled off. Most carvers therefore understand that they must sell to dealers in order to be successful. Wholesalers and store owners, unlike tourists, are familiar with many diflSerent types of pieces. The dealers' never-ending quest for originality should continue to foster the artisans' creativity. Anthropologists examining economic development might focus more on who can take advantage of the market niches accompanying the commercialization of particular products. The Oaxacan woodcarving trade allows artisans within particular communities to innovate and specialize in their attempts to take advantage of such niches. The conditions of trade for certain other products (perhaps bananas and coffee), in contrast, favor standardization on the local level and regional specialtza- tion. In such cases, intermediaries can easily specialize in attempts to establish market niches, but producers have much less autonomy than the Oaxacan woodcarvers. NOTES 1. This article is based principally on fieldwork carried out during the summers of 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 and from January to March 1998, and several other short-term research trips. I thank Holly Carver and Rafael Ricardez for introducing me to the woodcarvers and Saul Aragon for his assistance throughout this ongoing project. I do not use pseudonyms for the artisans. Many carvers have asked me to use actual names because they like the publicity for their pieces. 2. Many of the carvers had grandparents who spoke Zapotec or other indigenous languages and were identified by others as Indianss. Ethnicity in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca in both the past and present is too complicated to be examined in depth here. Many speakers of indigenous languages in the region self-identify primarily as residents of a particular community and do not think of themselves as belonging to a pan-Indian collectivity. They often secondarily self-identify as speakers of a particular indigenous language. 3. There are nowadays perhaps half a dozen female carvers in Arrazola and San Martin.</page><page sequence="18">242 ETHNOLOGY 4. Carvers in La Union have never used hired labor. 5. The very successful Teotitlan-based textile industry is eharacterized by almost as much variability as the woodearving trade (see Wood 2000). 6. The price of a carving in a store in the United States is typically four or five times what the maker is paid by a dealer. BIBLIOGRAPHY Barbash, S. 1993. Oaxaean Wood Carving: The Magic in the Trees.
