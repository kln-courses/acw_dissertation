For they have been armed, They have the book in hand and are learning the subtleties. What envy the modern philologist feels imagining the casual ignorance of Aristophanes' audience poring over their popular editions of the Oresteia , envy shaped by what are, in the case of the parodos to the Agamemnon , some of the most important and intractable instances of ocpa0ia or nescience in the history of western literary scholarship! What approach has yet to be essayed over the centuries to resolve the critical enigmas surrounding Calchas' prophecy? And where else has the absence of the book, a secure text, given rise to greater perplexities? The prudent efforts of classical philologists to secure the text in the face of the anxieties that this uniquely 61 Arethusa 34 (2001 ) 61-95 © 2001 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="3">62 J. Michael Degener complex work presents must not go unappreciated, but neither should such prudence any longer be allowed, in contravention of the spirit of Aristophanes' challenge, to foster an excessive, putatively empirical conservatism that impedes a courageous embrace of the poly valencies of Aeschylean ambigu- ity. For only such an approach will finally provide solutions to the age-old questions: what is the significance of Calchas' prophecy? What is the prophecy's relationship to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia? Why did Artemis demand the sacrifice of Iphigeneia? Moreover, such an approach is also necessary to provide the answer to a question that has not yet been properly posed, the key to all the others: did Artemis demand the sacrifice of Iphigeneia ? And to some others not yet imagined: what is the role of the symbolonl and the graphêl So we, too, must take the book in hand to respect the equally important exigencies expressed in the phrase, potvGócvei xa ôe^iá,1 i.e., "getting it right," without succumbing to an dcpocGia, a lack of knowledge, as regards the rhetorical subtleties of Aeschylean ambiguity and their profound implications. First, however, in the spirit of Aristophanes' indirect address to his Athenian audience, it is necessary to establish renewed attention to the dramaturgical-textual complexities and self-referential character of the Agamemnon. Segal's essay, "Vérité, tragédie, et écriture," displays a sensi- tivity to the multiple dimensions of the aesthetics of tragedy, particularly in its emphasis on the role of writing: "Désormais les poètes tragiques ne s'intéressent pas seulement à créer un spectacle, mais ils veulent aussi attirer l'attention sur leur propre pouvoir de créer des spectacles, sur le système des conventions avec lequel la forme elle-même opère" (1992.339). It is just such a dynamic that characterizes the opening of the Agamemnon , for Aeschylus alerts us in the closing words of the lookout's speech that special attention is due to what may be therein concealed (38-39): ooc&lt;p£GTctT ' ocv Xe^exev • àç £kgdv èyca paOovaiv a')8ćo kov paOovoi ^fļGopat [these walls] would tell these things most clearly, for I speak willingly 1 The phrase means "to learn xa Ôe^iá," literally "to learn the things on the right where xà ôe^iá has the further sense of "rhetorical subtleties."

Although it will be "most clear" only later, these words announce Aeschylus' precise relationship to his own audience (be it that of 458 b.c., 405 b.c., or in perpetuity) - in the clarity of his own words to follow and the division between those who will, and those who will not, learn his meaning. The lookout, alone on the palace roof, addresses the audience directly in a manner that simultaneously initiates the action of the play and reveals its aesthetic form. While explicit at 31, aúxóç t' cycoye cppoípiov Xopevoojjccu "I myself will dance the prelude," (as xopeuoopai indicates the imminent entrance of the chorus, xopóç, on stage), a more subtle conjunction is anticipated on the eastern horizon.

The lookout seeks an ànaXKay''v nóv cov (1, 20), "release, or transformation, from suffering," now only tentatively able to resist the brunt of the sym-bolon put into etymological play (15): to piļ ßeßaiox; ßAicpapa avp-ßaXeiv ürcvcp lest my eyelids be forcefully thrown together in sleep Such an ànaXKayx', however, will elude what will prove to be a futile attempt to reconstitute the sundered and counterposed components of the aural and visual registers, of oruyriv and cpaxiv, that comprise the symbolon. Where does this retrograde path lead? Only to flames atop the promontories of Troy? Or backwards, and back further, to a more distant scene whose stunning impact was the origin of this disjunction, the disaesthesis, of speech and image? 3 Bollack's commentary on the line, 1 98 1 . 1 6, begins to pursue this line of thought, "Mais on ne tient pas compte ainsi de l'unité que forme le vers 9 avec ses deux éléments qui associent la parole à l'éclat du feu: le « signe » du flambeau est analysé, la matière distincte du message qu'elle porte. En un troisième temps, le message est à son tour divisé et la parole (ßod;iv) en tant que médium du message, distincte de la nouvelle de la prise (átaóaipov), comme son contenu. La dissociation [emphasis added] isole, dans le signe, le dynamisme propre de l'élément de la fonction qu'il parvient à remplir."

A critical bearing must be identified that turns a distrustful eye on the stratomantis (martial prophet) Calchas. In the extensive literature, Peradotto alone (1969a.238) questions in any way what otherwise has amounted to implicit faith (not dissimilar to that faith for which Agamemnon will later be criticized, potvxiv ounva6 vj/eycov, "in no way impugning the prophet" [186]), in the apparent signifi- cance of Calchas' prophecy: "Is it correct to say that Artemis demands the sacrifice of Iphigeneia? All the text tells us (in the words of Calchas) is that she caused adverse winds, precipitating (a7C£uôo(xéva) the sacrifice, and that the sacrifice was a ļriļ%otp, an expedient or remedy for the bad weather, proposed by Calchas, and uncontested by Agamemnon (pcxvxiv ooxiva vj/eycov, 186). Artemis compels Agamemnon to nothing." That a lack of scrutiny is unwarranted is unequivocally evident from the contrastive and skeptical charge of the modest particle ôè, "but," in the verse responding to the chorus' guarded assertion of their authority and ability to sing persua- sively of the acts of powerful men, even, when irony demands, in proper hexameters, keôvòç ôè oxpaxópavxiç iôoov 86o tripotai Siooobç (123), "But the trusted prophet of the army . . ."

Instead, it is set on a syntactical, oppositional, par with Kpáxoç adding a subtle shift in nuance. The allegiant youth of Greece is no longer the neutral object of the Atridae's command, but rather is, by virtue of the now appositional grammar, the invaluable substance of their power, whose exploitation, by Agamemnon's hubristic nescience and Calchas' devious- ness, is damnable. 9 Since, by one degree of metonymy, oiœvœv, "birds," may be "omens" and name the specific power that makes Calchas a metaphorical king, then there is no reason to doubt that opviç, "bird," by two degrees of metonymy, names him metaphorically, particularly given the emphasis on his bird cries at 156 and 201 to be addressed below. 10 The deprecatory judgment of artificiality by Denniston-Page 1957.78, i.e., in its chiasmic phonetics: oiônôn basileus |X| basileusi neón, ironically fails to recognize the genius of the chiasmus whose artificiality is precisely the expression of the chorus' deliberate parody of Calchas' artificiality. It was also never adequate to accept, with Fraenkel 1950.67, unexamined suppositions of imprécisions ("loosely connected" |Schneidewin|) regarding the apparent discrepancies between the singular king and multiple birds, for Aeschylus draws specific attention to the implausibility of such a loose interpretation, first, in the focused chiasmic juxtaposition between singular paaitaóç (referring to Calchas the Ooópioç opviç) and plural ßaaitaooi and, definitively, in the rare and deliberate use of the</page><page sequence="8">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 67 old and famous rancor of //.1.1 06ff . 1 1 Calchas' duplicity is written all over line 122, iôcav 86o Àfipaai Siggooç, duplicity that picks up both sides of *8cxco, of receptive "perceiving" and causal, agential, 12 "teaching": 8iggo6ç 'AxpeíSaç pa^ípouç eSaq Aayo8aíxaç. It will presently be seen that Agamemnon fared poorly in his lesson in rhetoric, xòv m0ei páGoç (177), "learning by suffering," failing to raise the proper questions, pdcvxiv ouxiva yéycov, "in no way questioning, or impugning, the prophet," and missing the critical ôe^ía (145), "subtleties," to be explicated below. Why would Aeschylus have gone to such pains to present the chorus' suspicions of Calchas if not to alert his readers to attend to the sophisticated rhetorical complexities found in the substance of the prophecy itself? The point is not to follow the tragic path of Agamemnon's undoing, that is, not to fail to impugn, xj/éyeiv, the words of the prophet. IYMBOAON IOITENEIAI Calchas also gives an indication of the status of his own speech at the same time as he appears to be referring solely to what properly should be the independent circumstances of the portent, ôe^ià pèv Kaxápopcpa Se (páopaxa (145), "appearances at once dexia and evil." Calchas both deploys and reveals his own rhetorical duplicity in the word dexia. If "that which is good (dexia)" and that which is bad" are not simply as they have appeared, dual ßoGKojjevcü (119) (referring to the two eagles), which should well be retained from Denniston-Page. 1 1 I thank Marcel Detienne for reminding me of his analysis of the implicit struggle in Kpaiveiv between kings and prophets that will find its consummate tragic apotheosis below at line 144: see Detienne 1973 passim. 1 2 Throughout the passage, the archaic, hypostatic role of the prophet is questioned in light of the politically charged suggestion that Calchas acts individually. Acts, that is, as an individual agent, who, as the king of birds, actively determines, or assigns, èôár|, the "significance" of the portent of eagles, and is thereby vying for what would properly be the command of the kings of ships. This adds a further dimension to the question (central to ethico-juridically oriented interpretations) of Agamemnon's personal culpability for the sacrifice of his daughter. The question is not simply whether Agamemnon is personally culpable for the sacrifice, but also whether he is the one who is culpable. This question will become all the more problematic (along with prospects for a definitive ethico-juridical resolution) once the essentially unexamined question of whether Artemis initially de- manded the sacrifice is re-examined below. I would like to thank G. Nagy who noted the hypostatic role of the mantis viva voce. 13 Beyond, or rather historically prior to, the sense of dexia as rhetorical subtleties, the term indicates the right side on which auspicious portents appear.</page><page sequence="9">68 J.

The answer lies in the complexities of that word they modify, xà ^opßoAxx (144), "the "symbols?" These complexities relate directly to the question of the role of Artemis, a role that is most essential to what will later be the retributive "sacrifice" of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra. It is here that Peradotto's question may again be raised with a slightly different inflection:14 "'Did Artemis demand the sacrifice?" Presumably the reason this question has not yet been asked is that it seems to be one of the only certain elements in the prophecy. After all, what could be more straightforward than Calchas' statement that Artemis demanded that the symbols be accomplished (140), that she fashioned the ship-delaying winds (147), that she urged on that other catastrophic sacrifice (150)? Yet might not the tragically paradoxical nature of this moment, in which Artemis demanded the sacrifice of the one, Iphigeneia, who would have been most dear to her, have offended the rapidly evolving civility of Aeschylus' Athens much as it disturbs us? After all, Artemis' kindly disposition towards the young is related with particular emphasis, xóoov nep eiScppcov oc Koc^à (140), "For so kindly indeed is the beautiful one to the young of beasts," in the immediately preceding passage. It is again a modest particle, 7t£p (which bridges the apotropaic interruption of the syntax of Calchas' prophecy preceding the epode) that has turned all critical attention away from the solution to the enigmas. Modern editions, without exception, have followed the verse division in punctuating 1 37 with a period and commencing a new sentence at 140. Yet nep suggests that lines 140-43 present an appositional clause qualifying the preceding subject of what is now, once the interrupting incantation of the chorus is excised from their quotation of Calchas' prophecy, one complex sentence (134-43): o'ikxco yap èrcícpBovoç "Apxcpiç áyvà 7txavoîoiv kogi Ttaxpòç 14 Whereas Peradotto identifies the issue of the gulf between Calchas' mediacy and the purported will of the goddess Artemis, further confirmation of his thesis, along with other implications, is to be found in the following analysis of the intricacies of the expression of that mediacy.</page><page sequence="10">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 69 ocÚtÓtokov Tcpò Xó%ov jioyepòcv Ttxám Goopévoiaiv • 1 37 oTuyeî Sè ôeÎKVOv aÍ£xcov[,] 140 xógov nep eo(ppcov à koc Xa ôpÓGOiç àé7CTOiç paXepœv taóvxoov mvxcov i aypovópcov cpi^opaGxoiç Giļpcov oßpiKOctanGi X£p7cvá[.] For in pity reverend Artemis is wroth with the winged dogs of the father sacrificing the pathetic hare . . . 137 and she abhors the feast of eagles[,] 140 for so kindly indeed is the beautiful one to the wingless young of ravenous lions and tender to all the suckling young in the wild[.] This amendment does not present a problem until the impact of the period at 143 on the syntax of the following sentence is considered (144-50): 15 144 xouxcov aixeî ^opßotax Kpavail6[,] Scalèe pèv Kaxocpopcpa 8è (pocopocxa( ) irpov 8è KaXéco Flaiava, pri xivaç ocvxt7ivóo')ç Aavaoîç XP0VÍ- aç e^evfļSac; àrctanaç X£t)^Tļ, inEYAOMENA OuGÍav èxépav avopóv xiv' a8aixov Artemis ceases to be the subject of aixeî, and thus is no longer to be seen as demanding the sacrifice.

Michael Degener aiieî, but xet)^Tļ as well, and finally, in the crowning moment of this grammatical exercise in exceptions to the rules , govern what may now be read as the neuter plural , arce-oó-ó-jieva, of the participle by virtue of the paléographie undeterminability of the Doric IFIEYAOMENA. Despite the complexities of these rhetorical intricacies, they are clear , that is, "most clear to those who have learned" the dexia. In a rhetorical tour de force , Aeschylus presents Artemis as if she is demanding the sacrifice, while simultaneously revealing in the ambiguous dexia what amounts to a diametrically opposed significance. Due to the morphological identity between the nominative and accusative cases in the neuter of ^opßotax, the term, which has always been understood as accusative direct object of the verb areei, "demands," whose subject has been supposed to be only Artemis, can grammatically also stand as subject of the verb, "the symbola demand . . ." In accordance with the grammatical exception by which neuter plural nouns take third singular verb forms, the ^upßoX-a, instead of (or in addition to) Artemis, are the subject of aÏT£i and Teo^rļ, "fashion." And finally, according to the conventional use in tragedy of the Doric dialect in choral odes, where the Attic letter eta, a long syllable, is replaced with a long alpha, what would be a feminine singular participle in Attic, taking Artemis as subject, G7t£')ôopév77 becomes ojceoôopéva. But whereas eta is always a long syllable, alpha can be, on its face , either long or short. While this ambiguity is precluded in modern minuscule type by the position of the accent, the original paléographie text was written without accents . It is upon this final coup de grace that all the preceding ambiguities depend, for if the participle IFIEYAOMENA, "urging on," could not be read as governed by the neuter plural subject of the symbola , it could also not be taken as subject of the previous finite verbs. Before hastening forward, however, a certain objection must be noted that would call for the metrical healing of a muxv18 to check the transgressions that follow. "It doesn't scan" will be the rallying cry of those who fear the vicissitudes of unbridled ambiguity! For while the two possible forms are indistinguishable in the written form, this is not the case when spoken. Thus if the Agamemnon were essentially an oral text, that is, if the dactylic, epic tone of this passage was understood to actually qualify it as an apparent subject in the nominative case of the Ôí0povov icpáioç to its actual status as an accusative direct object. 1 8 A choral song of healing addressed to Apollo or Artemis.</page><page sequence="12">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 7 1 oral text (as with archaic epic proper), this entire brilliant rhetorical edifice would fall having been weighed in the balance of the length of one syllablel Fortunately, however, there is clear evidence - indeed the proof will finally be all-too-graphically evident - and Aeschylus is finally due a more literate appreciation lest Aristophanes' promise of an enlightened audience go unfulfilled. For now, the cry irpov19 Flaiava (146) must be left to Calchas, in his gesture to obscure the threat that the symbola present and to maintain the dissimulatory dactyls20 of his duplicitous rhetoric. So what is gained? In this reading, Artemis did not demand the sacrifice, instead she is only proffered in name, pótvxiç eKÀcty^ev jcpocpépcov, "the prophet screeched forth proffering [the name] 'Artemis,'" according to the Gépiç, the "law" or "tradition" or "custom," of such extreme circum- stances - the themis that will lead Agamemnon to believe in the justifiability of his bitter "decision,"21 rcapGevíoi) 0' aïpaxoç òpya Ttepiopyćo acp' £7ci0')ļi£Īv OéjLiiç (215), "and it is themis that they should lust passionately, wrathfully, after the virgin's blood." Artemis did not demand the sacrifice, on the contrary, she abhorred it.22 The symbola themselves demand to govern. But what would the implications of this be? Ultimately, the symbola will overwhelm even Calchas, who, despite his less-than-favorable relation- ship with Agamemnon, may be assumed to still have genuine hopes that the significance of the portent will not be fulfilled. But what exactly are the symbolal Previous interpretations have assumed that they are limited to the 19 That is, the voiced paean. 20 Is it not curious that precisely here there should appear a line that does not scan dactylic and interrupts the preceding and following dactylic lines? Curious too, that the "cretic," - 5e kcl'e - suggests the impetuous rhythm that would be threatening in both the meter, and the sense , of G7te')Ôopeva, were it to be pronounced in the neuter form? 21 Decision indeed it was, but on the basis of misinformation. Though Agamemnon will be saddled, or yoked, with the repercussions of his decision, it should be remembered that his first mistake was not here, but instead earlier when he did not question the authority of the "trustworthy" prophet. 22 This is confirmed in the pointedly ¿martemisian terms that describe the act: Öoaaeßrj xpomíav àvayvov, àvíepov (219), where àvayvov, "impure" echoes her explicit epithet at 134, "Apxepiç àyvcx, as well as in the alpha privatives of Calchas' description of the sacrifice, àvopóv xiv' àÔaixov (150). The sacrifice is ćwartemisian, not demanded by Artemis. It is here also that the aforementioned metrical observations may be proposed. This is the first of four lines that exhibit runs of short syllables comparable to what would have been the meter of 07ie')ôópeva, had it been voiced that way : str.: àvíepov (220), mpaKorcà (223), ant.: (pitaSpocxoi (230), 7tepi7iexTļ (233), all of which exhibit in sense and meter what would be the impetuousness of a7C£OÔopeva.</page><page sequence="13">72 J. Michael Degener portent of the eagles; the result is various inadequate attempts to explain Artemis' anger. But there is a convincing course beyond these difficulties that begins with a re-examination of the critical ambiguity at 136 that Vidal- Naquet once addressed, ocútótokov rcpò Xóxov poyepàv Tcxám Guopé- voioiv,23 but whose full significance has yet to be appreciated. In the first place, it confirms what has been said above, for surely Artemis could not have at once abhorred the sacrifice of Iphigeneia (who is without doubt the auTÓTOKov) and demanded it, which leads directly to the second aspect. For given that the phrase signifies simultaneously the portent of the eagles devouring the hare and the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and, specifically, that the "winged dogs of the father" refer simultaneously to the eagles and Agamemnon's henchmen, then Artemis' wrath applies both to the eagles and Agamemnon, and thus to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia itself Yet if Artemis, even when she is maintained as the subject of the verbs analyzed above, didn't demand this sacrifice, i.e., the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, then what would be the meaning of *07C£')ôojLi£va Guoíocv èxépav (150), what actually is the other sacrifice? The plural form of the symbola ,24 which now takes on a new significance, provides the solution. The plural symbola must not be understood simply, as in modern semiotics, as vague "symbols" acting as signifiers of independent referents. Rather, they must be understood in their archaic sense as opposing halves guaran- teeing a contractual relationship.25 The Guoíav èxépav is the other sacrifice of a pair.

Once the portent of eagles is absolutely, i.e., objectively, identified with the sacrifice, the phrase ceases to be an ambiguity in the strict sense of a reference to two different, i.e., independent , referents. This horrific statement, with its pecu- liarly epic ring (as one of those four true hexameters), is directly mocked by the line to which it is responding in the chorus' introduction, an introduction that refers to that act so pathetically, and blindly, lacking in aristeia , ßooKopevco taxyívav épncópova (péppaxi yévvav (119), "feeding on the pregnant hare along with her young." One shudders at this nightmarish, lascivious27 act, blatantly evident to all, including the Gods. Moreover, the reference to Iphigeneia is confirmed by the pun, ye wav, on her name, which means "strong birth." From the objective order of the symbolon , this phrase - which, according to the modern conception of the symbolic, is understood as indicating ambiguously two independent events, where the "one" "sym- bolizes" the "other" - is as little dissociable into two significations as the victim is divisible into two corresponding components, one "literal," relat- ing to Iphigeneia, the other "metaphorical," relating to the hare. The phrase, à la Heraclitus, does not signify , it sym-bolizes , in the etymological sense that Aeschylus is developing of a')|Li-ßaX,eiv.28 With the collapse of the erroneous "symbolic" distinction of the aujLißo^ov 'Icpiyeveíaç into one, comes as well the collapse of Calchas' ruse that would proffer "Artemis," 7ipo(p£pcov "ApT£|Liiv, as demanding what is no longer the "other" sacrifice of Iphigeneia, while, nonetheless, Calchas' dactylic, prophetic , Kpavai, may still stand.

THE "HYMN" TO "ZEUS" So, by an odd turn, it almost seems possible to reverse what has already been asserted regarding Artemis.

This sacrifice, which is the born-together (aóp-epmov as in aop-ßotaw) author of strife, is that which does not fear man, i.e., Clytemnestra's sacrifice of Agamemnon. Moreover, there is a distinct retrograde overtone in Ticchi vopioç, similar to those associated with the returning symbolon in the lookout's speech. 30 The point being that the calculation, cruaOp&amp;v, of ôe koXz as a "cretic" simply obscures an unmetrical moment of angst-ridden self-reflection during which Calchas' epic facade is failing and vulnerable to an imminent disruption. Despite Aristotle's assertion that those of Aeschylus' day would not have known the name, it is hard to overlook either the irony of the fact that this line could well have been analyzed by him as containing a metrical miáv (three short and one long syllables), or the applicability of its description, "[in written prosej ... the paeon must be adopted, since from this alone of rhythms mentioned no definite meter arises Rh. 1409a6ff. 3 1 Here in the peculiar case of not only the naming of Fiatava, but also Calchas' indirect self- reference in the first person verb, mXeco.</page><page sequence="16">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 75 save Zeus, if it is necessary to strike truly the grief from my mind in vain.

Aeschylus' unusual use of the term identifies a certain impasse that combines the 32 Given the chorus' agnosticism, íxruiç need not conform to a conventional assumption of anthropomorphism. For as Greek attributes gender to all classes of objects, this "mascu- line" indefinite need not be translated in the personified sense of "whoever" but could just as well be rendered as "whatever," particularly as here the signified of the name is itself in question. Regardless of how strange it sounds to strip this "Zeus" of the personification that a translation of the indefinite in the masculine lends "him," connotations of the gender of the term are not what they appear in English, whose inanimate objects lack gender. This subtle distinction devolves upon what is assumed in notions of persona. 33 In the Frogs, this term figures in the weighing of verses of Aeschylus and Euripides. This reference fits a broader pattern. First, there is the reference to the book at 1114. Aeschylus reads the invocation to Hermes (apparently to suggest the hermeneusis required of Aeschylus' poetry) that opens the second play of the Oresteia. Then, although one might expect the prophecy of Calchas, it is not until a bit later (1285ff.) that Euripides' mockery of Aeschylus on metrical grounds will turn out to include the verses of the chorus' introduction to the prophecy (104ff.). Finally, after his mockery of Euripides, it is Aeschylus who suggests that their verses be weighed, 'Eni xòv aiaGpòv yàp aòiòv àyayeîv ßovAopou (1365). 34 Actually two, counting the vocative for which one must wait until the next cycle of odes at 355, w Zeû ßaaiÄ,et&gt;, which will be touched upon below.</page><page sequence="17">76 J. Michael Degener apotropaic circumstances of the baleful caveat of Calchas' prophecy and the agnosticism of the guarded naming of "Zeus." Apparently none save "Zeus" can be identified as underlying the tragic impact of the prophecy and sacrifice, but, who or what is "Zeus"? The inability of the chorus to make the "comparison" is in fact an expression of the diaporesis that attends eo ipso this exposure to the very adequational semiosis, the referential "symboliza- tion," upon which depend the baleful ambiguities of Calchas' prophecy. For although the solution to the enigmas depends upon a recovery of the archaic symbolon , it is only by virtue of the disarticulation of the symbolon that the ambiguous reading that appears to assert Artemis' demand of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and thus her putative sanction of such according to " themisT arises in the first place. Moreover, the diaporesis is indicated precisely in connection with the semiosis of naming in the emphatic repetition of the preposition npoç in 162 and 163: toõto viv npoozvv énœ- / ouk ë'xco Trpoœimoai. For just as the chorus can only agnostically direct a name towards, 7cpoo-£v-£7ico, this name's ineffable object, so also do they doubt their own ability to arrive at an adequate solution to Calchas' prophecy, that is, they doubt their ability to make the proper 4W-equation," ^pocr-eiKaoai, save in identifying "Zeus," 7tÀ,r|v Aióç, whoever or whatever "he" may be. That to which the chorus casts out the name indicates the abyssal locus of tragedy, exposed through the disaesthesis of the symbolon . For whereas npocevvénco belongs expressly within the realm of the poetic, that is, the realm of speech, npoaeiKaaai belongs to the register of graphic representa- tion. Thus the diaporesis is resolved into two components: the chorus, uncertain of the adequacy of the name and nescient of the name's ineffable object, cast forth into the abyss, /rpo&lt;j£vv£7icö, a name for the ineffable only to see it go reeling off in its inflections, but so also are they unable to make a visual adequation, to liken forth, jipooeiKaaax an image. Yet beyond the generally accepted interpretation of these passages as an abstract theological interlude - and even beyond the still relatively undetermined agnostic implications just considered - there are more spe- cific implications to be identified. The key lies in re-evaluating the odes in the light of the chorus' recognition of Calchas' duplicity. And this is no mean task, given that the guarded expression of their suspicions, and the apotropaic context of the portent, conceal the extent of their understanding of the prophecy. It is this difficulty that gives the agnosticism of what is essentially a meditation on the name of Zeus its peculiarly intractable charge. Nonethe- less, progress is possible when the odes are viewed in a broader framework.</page><page sequence="18">Caesura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 77 CALCHAS, INVERSE CASSANDRA Once Calchas' duplicity has been established, it may be adduced that his role is precisely the inverse of Cassandra's. Calchas is the false prophet that everyone trusted.

Furthermore, the sole other instance of the term 7ipooeimoai35 appears in conjunction with Cassandra, confirming the interpretation of 163 just advanced. The chorus, trying to decipher Cassandra's visions, states (1130-31): o') Kojamoaip ' âv Gcatpaxcov yvcopcov oucpoç eivai Kam S 8e xco xpoaeiKàÇœ xáSe. though I shall not boast, I am the best at interpreting the meaning of oracles, I do liken forth these things to evil. While the picture is still vague, and the vagueness of this picture of evil is reminiscent of the uncertainties associated with the agnostic picture of "Zeus," two critical issues are nonetheless clarified: first, the argument above, that Aeschylus is juxtaposing the visual and aural registers, is well- founded. The chorus' difficulties in adequating Cassandra's prophetic words and visions are plainly stated, xouxcov ãiSpíçei'it xcov pavxcupotxcov ( 1 105), "I am blind to these prophecies,"36 and, more expressly still (11 12-13): 00710) ^oviļKa • vûv yàp eÇ aiviypáxcov £7capyepoiai 0eo(páxoiç aprļ^avco. 35 The term, with the preposition, is uncommon.

Michael Degener It would not appear too outlandish to translate this as: I can't put it together (Jjuvqm): I am now at an impasse with these veiled37 oracles of enigmas. But more specifically still, it is only once Cassandra's exhortations demand that the chorus literally "See! See!" a a i8oi) iSoò (1 125) that they will be able, if imperfectly, to "see through" her words and liken these images, 7ipoG£imÇcô, to evil. The second point relates to the hymn to Zeus, for the sole recur- rence of 7ipoo£imÇcô in connection with Cassandra confirms that the odes to Zeus express neither abstract theology nor merely a vague agnosticism. Instead, these passages speak directly to the enigmas of the prophecy. When viewed as the chorus' statement of their own attempt at interpreting Calchas' prophecy, the odes take on a much more immediate and integrated role in the development of the narrative and, indeed, reveal certain ambiguities yet to be recognized. Lines 165-66 (and responding lines 174-73), dactylic lines that directly recall Calchas' tone, take on a distinctly different appearance. The first pair have always been difficult (165-66): 7cXxļv Aióç, £i tò páxav arcò cppovxíSoç â%0oç XpTļ ßaX,£iv £XT1xt)fia&gt;ę- ßa^eiv must be linked with the evolving etymologization of the symbolon (particularly given its proximity to éxrixôpcoç) inaugurated in lines 8 and 15 of the lookout's speech and reaching its apotheosis in the symbola of Calchas' prophecy. It is in correctly reading the symbola that the enigmas of Calchas's prophecy are revealed. Accordingly, there is definite reason to believe that ßataiv here refers directly to the symbola : "If it is necessary to strike , or cast [the symbola] correctly." Given what we now know about the chorus' awareness of Calchas' duplicity, interpretations that rely upon con- struing pcxxav as adverbial or even as qualifying adjectivally (in sense) a%0oç to suggest that the burden is inconsequential38 no longer make much 37 eTtapyepoę means literally to have a film over the eyes. 38 For example, Denniston-Page 1957.84, "'If need arises truly to cast away (ánó with ßataiv) the vain burden of anxiety.' páxav '.futile, because being anxious does nothing to</page><page sequence="20">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 79 sense. If "striking" truly meant solving the prophecy then it would seem that it would be páxav, "folly" or "delusion," (that is, páxav39 taken simply as an accusative object of the infinitive ßaX,eiv), that would be struck from the mind, arcò cppovxíôoç. Thus, if it weren't for the problem of the second accusative àxôoç, the line would be saying that "Zeus" is all that can be proffered in name, if it is necessary to strike truly the false appearance of the prophecy from the mind. Unfortunately, I can offer no certain solution as to how to construe axôoç. But even if, as may be the case, it is just not quite possible to construe pòruav as the object of ßaA,eiv, it is still most likely preferable to restore the Tr text, ei ye páxav àrcò cppovxíôoç a%0oç %prļ ßa^ew éxrixòpcúç, to be translated as, "if [ei], though [ye] futile, it is necessary to strike truly the burden from the mind." Furthermore, one point must not be overlooked: the chorus are recounting the past , and although the sacrifice of Iphigeneia had yet to transpire by this point in the recollection of the sequence of past events, and although it is important dramaturgically to consider the audience as expe- riencing these events as if in the present,40 the chorus knows that the sacrifice will in fact have occurred. It is for this reason that the burden, or anxiety, can neither be conceived of as inconsequential nor even vague. For if so, the anxiety would not have persisted to the present. Thus it may be ventured that it is the chorus' "solution" to the prophecy (as their best attempt at casting the symbola correctly) that they sense is futile, that is, the interpretation that despite the horrific nature of the sacrifice, Zeus sanctions the Atridae's actions. And thus the anxiety is not that of the past that is realized simply in the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, but instead is that which persists into the present. If the prophecy finally meant simply what both Agamemnon and the tradition have supposed, namely that the full extent of the evil caveat of Calchas' prophecy was limited to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia and that once that heinous deed had been carried out the worst was over, then there would no longer be grounds for present anxiety, remorse perhaps, but not an a%0oç that continues to weigh on the mind. It may be stated thus: the help matters," etc. By contrast, Fraenkel's discussion, 1950.2.102, does not dismiss the problem so simply and cites what appears to be a more reasonable solution in Headlam's, "cast off the strange, vague burden on my mind." 39 There is another question that resists solution: is there, beyond the instance noted above of the ambiguity of IFIEYAOMENA, rhyme or reason for Aeschylus' employment of Doric forms, such as paxorv here? 40 That is, as in the ilio tempore pre-conditioned by the tradition of epic recitation.</page><page sequence="21">80 J. Michael Degener sacrifice was not cathartic. The chorus is left with the lingering burden of anxiety as they sense, even if they can't quite peg what is hidden in the prophecy, that the sacrifice did not expiate the full evil of the caveat. And along with their lack of faith in the form of the "solution" to the specific crisis, i.e., "Zeus," comes a general crisis in their faith in the substance of this "solution," the crisis of a formalist agnosticism. But this is not all, for the lines that respond to this syntactical quagmire also have secrets to yield. In this case, the syntax is a bit more forgiving, Zrjvoc Sé ti ç 7ipocppóvcoç 87ïivîkkx KÀ,áÇcov / Tetterai (ppevéov xò Ttav (174-75). Again, it is a matter of naming Zeus. But beyond the conven- tional, abstract, mythico-theological interpretation, "one crying forth 'Zeus' the victorious will hit the mark entirely," the lines again must be read in the specific context of the prophecy. Beyond the ring of the isolated dactyls of this line, which forge a link to their dactylic critique in the introduction to the prophecy, there is a specific reference to Calchas to be identified in xiç, "one who." This reference emerges from an ambiguity based on two points. First, the morphological convergence of ruyxotvco and xeuxco in the future tense, and, second, the fact that cppevœv may be either the genitive plural of the noun (pprjv or the nominative singular participle of the rare poetic verb cppevóco. "But one41 screeching42 with forward mind43 the victory rites, contrives44 'Zeus,'45 deliberately instructing46 . . ." Although this reading actually makes neater work of the double accusative (Çqva, èrcivíiaa), the two ambiguous elements must be supported. Opevcov as a participle of cppevoco is supported by the relationship of Calchas and Cassandra.

It is in Cassandra's next extended speech that supporting evidence is to be found for the ambiguity between Tuy^ávo) and tevxcû. For just before Cassandra states plainly that Clytemnestra will be the murderer of Agamemnon, she notes that Agamemnon has failed to identify the delusion of her words ( 1 228-33): ot)K oiSev oïcc yÀxoaaa pioíyrriç kuvóç Xe^OLGOL KCCKTEÍvaOa (paiÔpÓVODÇ 8ÍKT1V CXTT1Ç taxBpaíOU, TevÇeTGCl KCXKT1 VVXTÌ- Toiomia Torpor 0Í1À,"uç âpaevoç (poveúç eoxív • xi viv mÀxmaa Suacpi^eç Sockoç zvxoifi 'àv; He does not see the ways in which the tongue of the accursed hound, speaking and extending a shining welcome in the manner of secret delusion, will contrive with evil fortune.

Rather it is used to indicate all that is involved in Cassandra's visions and utterances. 49 The verb appears only in poetry, only extremely infrequently, only in two other instances in Aeschylus' extant œuvres, and solely here, unambiguously that is, in the Agamemnon. It is worth noting as well in support of the ambiguity, that this form with epsilon in the stem is distinctly contrasted to the two forms with omicron that essentially bracket it, 7ipo(ppóvwę (174) and cppoveîv (176). More will be said on the proliferation of these (ppqv terms below. 50 See, for example, Denniston-Page 1957. 182 who opt for a reading of tuyxowcd: '"He does not know what kind of detestable bitch's tongue, having spoken and with cheerful</page><page sequence="23">82 J.

That this occurrence of xeú^eiai is both from te'&gt;xco and referring back to the chorus' ambiguous reference to Calchas is moreover indirectly confirmed in the closing words of Cassandra's speech. Having revealed her true prophecy of the false ways of Clytemnestra (that is, of she who, as the cpoßepa mAivopxoç [154], "the recurring fear," the pvápcov Míjviç [155], "the Wrath that does not forget," will effect, Tenderai, by her false means of persuasion , the other sacrifice), Cassandra speaks of her own powers of persuasion (1239-41): Kai xéovô' òpoíov eï ti prļ neidœ- xx yáp; tò péMov Tļ^ei- Kai aú p' èv xáyzx mpcov äyav y ' áXr¡6ópavtiv oiKxípaç épeîç. But if somehow I shall not have persuaded you of these things, it is just the same. What of it? What is to be will come; and soon you will anyway, in pity, call me too-true a prophet. Whereas Cassandra openly announces her attempts at persuasion, Calchas' artful contrivances are only obliquely identified after the sacrifice in the closing words of the parodos, xé^vai ôe KáXxavT0Ç °^K otKpavxoi (248), "the technae of Calchas did not go unaccomplished."

The problem here involves the notion of the tongue "striking." For an elaborate, but unconvincing, attempt to circumvent this problem see Thomson 1966.2.97.

In this aspect, the responsion of xeò^exai reinforces the sense of ßa^eiv as "striking" the burden from the mind.

Michael Degener Next is the repetition of the cppfļv terms, which, as related to cognition, also relate to pá0oç. What is to be learned, who is to learn it, and how? Once it is recalled that the chorus already suggested of Calchas that his "interpreta- tion" of the portent involved an active assignment of its meaning at 124, èôári, it makes all the more sense to see Calchas as the xiç and thus as the subject of cppevôv (cppevoco): One [i.e., Calchas] deliberating actively and/or56 in ad- vance (7ipocppóvcoç) screeching the victory rites will con- trive "Zeus," giving the instruction (cppevcov, [èôócr|]) to consider (to . . . cppoveîv)57 him [Zeus] (xòv58) entirely59 (mv) as the one who puts the men [Argives] on the road,60 as he who lays it down that the law of "learning by suffering" hold sway:61 thus the toil of a mindful misery stands62 before the heart instead of sleep, and sound con- sideration (ococppoveîv) comes against their will. Lest there be any reluctance in accepting the crux of this reading in the articular infinitive to cppoveîv, consider first the development of the cppfļv terms, their momentum: first, Calchas deliberates, Tcpocppóvcoç; sec- ond, he articulates, cppevcov; third, the host accepts the rendition Calchas offers by virtue of this active manifestation of the cppfļv in their own cppfļv, cppoveîv, and, finally, this activity, cppoveîv, which entails the acceptance of Calchas' false advice, is corrected by the m0ei pá0oç, and sound consider- 56 Both senses of Tipo-. 57 Articular infinitive as direct object. 58 Direct object of the articular infinitive xò . . . cppoveîv. 59 That is, without question. 60 Where ó&amp;woavxa recalls explicitly the earlier references to the road, oSiov Kpcxxoç ( 104) and pópoip' (X7t ' òpvíOcov òôícov (158). 61 This institution of power, icupícoç ë^eiv, recalls the first word of the chorus' ironic critique of Calchas, KÚpióç dpi (104). 62 The hypothesis offered here, though not of consequence to the argument being advanced, is that the text may have read axaxd as a third singular of what would be an occurrence of an unattested form of the otherwise prefixed form of īcrriļpi, -axaxeco. Although the point is not to be pressed, one would have to consider first that this prefixed form is rare before the fifth century, but ubiquitous with a variety of prefixes in Aeschylus. More important, however, is the resonance that is suggested between àv0' oîivou ( 1 79) and Tióvoç ( 1 80) and the same resonance in the lookout speech at line 14, &lt;xv0' otivod mpaaxaxeî, and by association line 1, 7ióvcov, as well as 976: Ôeípa 7ipoaxaxf|piov mpôíaç.</page><page sequence="26">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 85 ation comes upon them, ciôxppoveîv. Now consider that in lieu of (or rather in addition to) the conventional interpretation where cppoveîv (176) is taken in its verbal force in indirect statement, this nominal reading of cppoveîv as an articular infinitive is supported by the nominal force of that term that is directly related to it in sense, ococppoveiv, despite the absence of an ex- pressed article. The conclusion of this extended course of interpretation comes in the antistrophe (184ff.), where what is actually the divergent, "epiphenom- enal," course of the supposedly theological - be it theistic or but vaguely agnostic - interlude converges with the specific and fully integrated con- tinuation of the interrogation of Calchas, and both courses break unequivo- cally into the open expression of the train of baleful events leading to the sacrificial altar at Aulis. Thus it is in response ( 1 86) to the closing words of the "theological" interlude that the effectuation of Calchas' ruse is manifest in Agamemnon's fatal mistake to "in no way impugn the prophet." And thus, soon thereafter, the prophet proffers63 forth "Artemis" with the result that Agamemnon will say, ßotpeia pèv Kqp xò pq 7u0éa0ai (206), meaning ostensibly that it is heavy not to obey the goddess, but also carrying with it a more literal reference to Calchas' persuasion. And it is Kal-khas' name that rings out in the description of the site of the atrocity : Aulis across from XaA,- kíôoç (190).

And it is quite correct to speak here of a hermeneusis, for the chorus indicates the necessity for such plainly in their words to the messenger in reference to Clytemnestra's preceding speech (615-16): aoxq pèv ouxcoç eine pavOávov ri ooi, Topoîoiv èpprjvevciv evTtpexœç Xoyov • 63 Where the term Ttpcxpépœv echoes the train of &lt;ppr|v terms noted above, both npo-cppóvcoç and (ppevtov.</page><page sequence="27">86 J. Michael Degener Thus she has spoken, to you having learned with clear hermeneusis the account that appears well. But despite appearances, the chorus' words contain an untoward suggestion. It is more a matter of nuance than ambiguity to see in these words the suggestion that what a clear hermeneusis reveals is that her account, her logos , only appears to be auspicious, but is actually otherwise. And once her words are examined in the light of the prophecy, it is clear enough why the chorus would be making such a suggestion. At 600-01 she says, 07U(DÇ ó' cxpioxa xòv èpòv aiôoîov rcóoiv OKEVGco TtáÀav poÀóvxa 8é^ao0ai • which is generally understood to mean, "I must hasten to receive my husband . . ." But it also means, "I must hasten my husband home to be received . . ." in consonance with the hidden significance oflllEYAOMENA (151) that referred to the hastening on of Agamemnon's sacrifice, which is exactly Clytemnestra's object.

And 64 This term, ßacptxq, both here and in its other occurrences, is perhaps the most concealed enigma in the play, and this translation is little better than a guess. It is clear, however, that they are tied in with, and referring back to, the lcpÓKou patpàç (239) of Iphigeneia. 65 The term is derived from sema.

Succumb that is to the rcpoa-ßoAaiq66 where, in a sense, a seal is broken, releasing, however, only a simulacrum of truth in the form of an anagrammatic trope on the name KaA-^ocę, as a certain bane, oívoç, appears in false bronze, rcpercei, though strange- gleaming , awoAaprceę, with a vengeance, kclkov ôè ^aA-Koo (390).67 At the extreme limit that the anagrammaticity of this trope occupies, there appears (accord- ing to that objective mode of appearance, Ttpercei) for a last fleeting instance, the most brilliant possible illumination cast back on the enigma of the symbola , before all reflexivity itself v anishes in the false bronze. All reflexiv- ity, that is, including that which even threatens to be lost in the mise-en- abîme of Aeschylus' own rhetoric so indisputably indicated in this fully prescient reference to the xpÓ7cov, "trope," as naming the rhetorical figure per se. With this "bronze," the reflective tain disappears and, with it, the clear, if shattered, resolution of ambiguity,68 before the image per se , the öpviv (394) is released all together.69 But there is one all-important image still to be considered, an image that was a graphe , or rather only like a graphe , in as much as it will be difficult to say on what it could have been written. This is not, however, the first instance of such "grammaticity" in Aeschylus.

For those who would still doubt the subtlety of Aeschylus' rhetoric, consider the way in which he has already precluded any doubt by prefiguring the phonetic turn on KaX-xaq with XaA-icíÔoç (190). 68 That is, of the sort of proto-dialectical ambiguities manifest in the prophecy, which provide for clear, if contradictory, resolution. 69 I will treat the free play of the released image, opviç, which will take the form of the phantom of Helen, in a future manuscript. 70 He translates first: "Nous saurons ... si, pour le ramener, il suffira de lettres d'or ciselées sur un bouclier, flux d'insolence d'un cœur en délire," and second, "Nous saurons si des lettres d'or le ramèneront sur son bouclier, perdent son sang à flots, dans les spasmes convulsifs de ses entrailles."</page><page sequence="29">88 J. Michael Degener verbe Karafei souligne la valeur magique des mots, qui deviennent des acteurs. Ce sont les mots inscrits sur le blason qui annoncent et peut-être provoqueront la mort."71 Numinous and active as these gold-wrought grammata are, however, the cledonomancy72 by which they operate, and by which the hero's body is literally strewn over the letters , has, in this earlier play, yet to work itself into the text beyond the strictly oral level to which the ambiguity is limited. It is not until the bronze upon which symbola were conventionally engraved73 disappears in what may be a reference to the lead tablets of engraved "binding curses,"74 that the «««grammatical trope on Calchas's name proves to be a step beyond the oral self-reflexivity of cledonomancy into the cledono graphia of the symbola of the prophecy. It is not surprising that Calchas invoked flaiava in vain,75 as the figuration of his dissemblance in the disfiguration of his name, trope over trope, reveals the caesura of the objective order of the graphic symbolon and, with it, the fall of an epic "hero" on a tragic stage along with ërcoç per se, both in the terms of this cledonographia and on the most trenchant level of the Aeschylean text itself.76 It is in the gulf between the orality of the prophecy and its transcription in mute symbola that the metrical obstacle to unlocking the ambiguity of IFIEYAOMENA is obviated and, thus, all hopes 71 Moreau 1991.22. 72 Peradotto 1969b.2 explains: "It was felt that such an utterance might have the power of bringing about an effect, 'not indeed irrespective of its meaning, but other than the meaning of the intention of the person who carelessly uttered it' (Halliday) or, from another point of view, that a god makes of the speaker an instrument for presaging the future, much as he might use an inspired prophet of birds in flight." 73 See Gauthier 1972.33: "Dans plusieurs textes officiels, graves sur bronze [emphasis added], le terme apparaît avec la signification de garant ou témoin. Ces textes ne sont pas postérieurs au milieu du Vo siècle." 74 Peradotto 1969b.7, n. 19: "The belief in the potency of language even applies to the written word. Closely related to the hymnoi desmioi are the katadesmoi and katadeseis . . . These 'binding curses' in written form, inscribed on lead tablets [emphasis added [ or potsherds, have been discovered in many parts of the Mediterranean world, but the oldest examples come from Greece, most of them from Athens." Peradotto cites Guthrie 1950.273, who mentions an example of the use of such tablets in incapacitating "one's adversaries in a lawsuit." Note the importance of the written medium of the curse in muting its victim, "I bind Theagenes in tongue and soul, and the speech that he is preparing . . ." 75 And it would not be surprising if others, subject to the same graphophobia, despite what this strange-gleaming bane, crívoç, "reveals" in the name, will . . . 76 Segal 1992.337: "A la place du poète oral qui nous parle en personne de «la volonté de Zeus», nous avons le poète absent [and his absent , invisible text, like a katadesis, pinned down backstage - my additions} qui a tramé d'avance chaque détail.

Michael Degener As when a man, thinking to make an excursion through a stormy night, prepares a lantern, a flame of burning fire, fitting lantern-plates to keep out every sort of winds, and these plates disperse the breath of the blowing winds; but the light leaps out through them , in so far as it is finer, and shines across the threshold with unwearying beams: so at that time did the aboriginal Fire, confined in membranes and in fine tissues, hide itself in the round pupils; and these ( tissues ) were pierced throughout with marvelous passages. They kept out the deep reservoir of water sur- rounding the pupil, but let the Fire through (from within) outwards , since it was so much finer, (trans. Freeman 1957.61) It is the repeated emphasis on the forceful outward movement of the fire of the gaze from within the eye, nvp 8' e^co SiaGpcoaicov, that bears directly upon another stunning ambiguity now to be unbridled. While line 248, toc 8' ëv0ev oui' eiSov out' evvercco, is, on one level, the most powerful expression of the apotropaic gestures of the chorus that punctuated the prophecy of Calchas and that shared in expressing, to a certain degree, a tacit, if skepti- cal, complicity in the call for an homophonous prayer for the best, it was not finally possible to turn away, to avert the gaze from the graphic horror of the sacrifice. The ambiguity arises in the morphology of eiSov, at once first person singular and third person plural , which simultaneously reveals and conceals the taboo event: "What happened next they / 1 did not see, and 1 do not say." When the phenomenological progress of the line is considered, particularly as it would have been performed, it is clear that initially eiSov must be assigned to the host at Aulls, since the scene at Aulis has just been described, leading to the very brink of the ocpayri (the cutting of the throat of the sacrificial victim) at the hands of the assembled sacrificers. The reason they did not see is because they were blinded , having been struck by the stigmatizing shafts of Iphigeneia's active Empedoclean gaze, aie' oppaxoç ßeA,ei, "missiles from the eyes," in a Gorgonic epiphany of the graphe. The revelation of the blinding impact of the graphe in the words of the chorus only "register," however, that which was already indicated in the one re- maining enigma of Calchas' prophecy (131-33): oiov prļ xtç axa 0eó0ev Kvecpá- cr' 7tpox')7rèv cxogiov peyot Tpoíaç axpax(o0év •</page><page sequence="32">Cœsura of the Symbolon in the Agamemnon 9 1 The significance is now clear, "Let not some delusion from the gods blind, having been struck81 in advance, the great bit of Troy in the moment of their marshalling." That the graphic impact of the image of the sacrifice operates at the etymological level of the symbolon is supported by the findings of Moreau (1976-77.78-89), who describes the role of the Gorgonic gaze in connec- tion with Clytemnestra's murder of Agamemnon, arguing that she hypno- tizes him at the entrance to the palace. There are telling echoes in Agamemnon's expression of his fears that reflect the Artemisian blow and logic of the symbolon , pf| tiç 7tpóoco0£v ôppaxoç ßaXoi cpGóvoç (947), "lest some rancor from afar strike [ballein] me." The events of the carpet scene are the counterpart, the Guaiocv exepav, "the other sacrifice," the recom- pense for Iphigeneia's sacrifice, her symbolon , that completes the pair of symbola. Moreover, the dramaturgical significance of line 248 is profoundly important. The ambiguity of eiSov (they/l did not see) represents quite accurately the blinding event. The poetics of the shift in number here are directly comparable to the shift in case at line 1 12 discussed above. There the violent appearance of the Goúpioç opviç, "warlike bird," radically al- tered the previously assumed course of the syntax. The result was a violent reversal cast back retroactively on the Atridae. Though the syntactical shift was abrupt and did not quite grammatically result in a strictly ambiguous separate reading, the violence of the shift nevertheless destabilizes the force of Kpáxoç82 so that it takes on for a moment the charge of ambiguity. This is to be compared to the ambiguity attending this last moment in the long recollection of past images, in this last fixed graphe. EiSov registers drama- turgically the precise nature of the Gorgonic blinding. First, the blinding is revealed to the spectators, who, having been led to the very moment of the sacrifice by the descriptive words of the chorus , image by image, phrase by 81 The instantaneity of the moment, with all of the force associated with the symbolon , is indicated in the aorists of both 7cpoi07cév and axpaico0év. The instantaneousness of the marshalling was also suggested in the chorus' anticipatory description of the forces, (ppova, which also may now more clearly be understood as yet another inflection on the etymological dimension of crup-ßoctaw. 82 It must also be recalled that Kpáxoç itself stems from Kpávai, which has its own connotations of power at once rhetorical or mantic and military. That it is specifically Calchas' rhetorical Kpáxoç that overcomes that of the Atridae is confirmed when, at line 249, it is stated that Calchas' skills did not go unaccomplished, xe^vcu 5e KáXxavxoç oùk aKpavxoi.</page><page sequence="33">92 J.

They are presented rather with the task of watching the blinding of others , in a moment where vicarious experience and ritual participation are abruptly shaken loose into true objec- tive spectatorship. The spectators are blinded only to the degree to which the production of that last unspeakable and unseeable image has been revealed all along as having been dependent upon the sym-bolic relationship of speech and image , all along vulnerable to the disaesthesis registered here in oik' eiÔov out' èvvénco , " they/l did not see , and I do not say ." Possible only by virtue of all of the registers of drama, this is the tragic moment par excellence; a moment that reveals, pace Aristotle, that the essence of tragedy could never have been contained by any concept of catharsis, but rather can be approached only by an appreciation of the failure - the suspension - of ritual catharsis.83 Although the chorus here, now, on stage in the present moment, would like to leave this horrific moment of the past unsaid and unseen and turn their attention forward to what would have the appearance of being favorable signs, the brunt of the graphic symbolon has already registered its impact in the strict separation of the ambiguity indicating the blinding of the host, such that the retroactive apotropaic assignment of the first person singular will never alloy with the false base dropping away already into the "chthonian darkness" of the Kvecpcov. They, Agamemnon and the Argive host, did not see the graphe because the false metal of their minds would not take the print, but, with the npoößohaiq of the symbola , showed "fixed black" instead, petaxpTcayriç.

So the apotropaic statement of the chorus, oirc' eiSov out' evvejcco refers not only to the moment of the sacrifice, but to the entirety of the Trojan war that is waged hypnotically , oop-ßataiv, "thrown together in sleep," below the eastern horizon and that falls under the constellation of the sigetic,86 disaesthetic, sublimity that governs until the symbolon will be reconstituted from its sundered components of ai)yiļv, "ray," and (pdrciv, "report," having been passed in mute flame from hand to hand, in the significative speech of the first actor on stage, Clytemnestra, TEKpap ToiouTov oopßotaSv té goi Xéjco (315), "this is the sign and symbolon I tell youf thereby erupting back into the dialogue and action of the present.

At the same time Aeschylus' own written text , the actual fixed graphe itself, is concealed behind the scene according to a poetics oddly reflective, ocivoÀ,a|i7téç - according to a kind of Persean "anagram- maticity" beyond the tain and breaking the seal of the Gorgon's gaze - of the spectating audience upon whom is written metaphorically the transmutation of the corrupted sacrifice into the dramaturgical expiation - or suspended "catharsis" - of passively participatory, vicarious, and sympathetic experi- ence. Finally, on that highest cosmic level of the lookout's speech, the symbola must be seen as having held sway - for the technae of Calchas did not go unaccomplished - as well as having been enregistered in the "meta- phoric" graphe that was the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and the literal graphe that refers to the technê of writing peculiar to the textuality of tragedy; that literal graphe where the final, highest mark of textual self-reflexivity goes a decisive step beyond the orality of cledonomantic self-reflections, appearing rather in the very mute liminality of the written page confronting Aeschylus, confronting Aristophanes with book in hand , confronting the enlightened modern eye.
