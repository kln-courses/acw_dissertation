Psychologism has been the storm center of concerted criticisms since the nine teenth century, and is thought by many to have been refuted once and for all by Kant, Frege, Husserl, and others. The project of accounting for objective philo sophical or mathematical truths in terms of subjective psychological states has been largely discredited in mainstream analytic thought. Ironically, psychologism has resurfaced in unexpected guises in the form of intuitionistic logic and mathe matics, cognitivism, and naturalized epistemology. I examine some of the princi pal objections to psychologism - distinguishing roughly between good and bad or philosophically acceptable versus unacceptable psychologism - and consider the extent to which a new wave of psychologism may be gaining prominence in contemporary philosophy, and the light its successes and failures may shed on the original concept and underlying perspective of classical psychologism. Keywords: Psychology, psychologism, logic, metaphysics, epistemology, episte mology naturalized, Kant, Wittgenstein, Boole, Rescher, Quine. 1. Psychology and Psychologism The word psychologism historically has meant many things, but has most often been considered a term of abuse leveled against efforts to explain or address philosophical concepts or problems from the standpoint of subjec tive psychological experience. The same degree of opprobrium, notably, does not attach to psychology itself, which has generally been regarded as a legitimate subject of scientifisc and philosophical investigation. This is true even for opponents of such conventional psychological theories as Cartesian dualism, phenomenology, behaviorism, computationalism, and other branches of cognitive science. The trouble, according to critics, occurs specifically when the attempt is made to turn psychology of any form and following any methodology into a philosophical ideology, when ever and to whatever extent psychology becomes an "ism."1 1 See, inter alia, Philipse. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackweli Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="2">262 DALE JACQUETTE 2. Kant's Anti-Psychologism in Logic and Ethics Although the mere mention of psychologism in some circles is enough to discredit a philosophical program, there does not seem to be any single objection universally raised against every version of psychologism in every philosophical subdiscipline. It may nevertheless be fair to say that what concerns many theorists about psychologism is that it appears to threaten the objectivity of philosophical reasoning. Kant's criticisms of empirical considerations in any aspect of what he calls "formal" as opposed to "material" rational knowledge are historically representative of this attitude. In Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant proposes to purify logic and ethics alike of "empirical," by which he clearly means to include psychological, elements. Following the "ancient Greek" Stoic philosophy which he takes as his model, Kant first distinguishes between the three philosophical "sciences" of physics, ethics, and logic. Then he argues: Logic can have no empirical part - a part in which univeral and necessary laws of thinking would rest upon grounds taken from experience. For in that case it would not be logic, i.e., a canon for understanding or reason which is valid for all thinking and which must be demonstrated ... All philosophy, so far as it is based on experience, may be called empirical; but, so far as it presents its doctrines solely on the basis of a priori principles, it may be called pure philos ophy. The latter, when merely formal, is logic; when limited to definite objects of understanding, it is metaphysics. (Kant 1959, 3-4; see Beck 1960, 53-55) Kant in this passage sounds all the major themes of anti-psychologism. Logic must be valid for all thinking, and cannot be derived from empirical study of particular subjective experience. A pure - as opposed to applied - philosophy, according to Kant, must identify and try to articulate exclu sively a priori principles that are grasped independently of empirical contingencies as universally true. Kant has undoubtedly identified what most of its critics find troublesome about psychologism. Philosophy has an a priori conceptual subject matter that is adulterated and compromised by the intrusion of empirical, and especially subjective, psychological factors and methodologies. Kant then extends the same argument to pure moral theory, considered as a branch of formal philosophy. He asks: Is it not of the utmost necessity to construct a pure moral philosophy which is completely freed from everything which may be only empirical and thus belong to anthropology? That there must be such a philosophy is self-evident from the common idea of duty and moral laws. Everyone must admit that a law, if it is to hold morally, i.e., as a ground of obligation, must imply absolute necessity; he must admit that the command, "Thou shalt not lie," does not apply to men only, as if other rational beings had no need to observe it... He must concede that the ground of obligation here must not be sought in the nature of man or in © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 263 the circumstances in which he is placed, but sought a priori solely in the concepts of pure reason . . . Thus not only are moral laws together with their principles essentially different from all practical knowledge in which there is anything empirical, but all moral philosophy rests solely on its pure part. Applied to man, it borrows nothing from knowledge of him (anthropology) but gives him, as a rational being, a priori laws. (Kant 1959, 5) Kant finally rejects empirical elements not only from "pure" philoso phy, but from philosophy per se. Philosophy must be altogether a priori in its underlying principles, or else it does not deserve to be distinguished from empirical science. In order to assure that philosophy is worthy of its name, Kant concludes, it must have nothing whatsoever directly to do with empirical psychology or, as he prefers to say, "anthropology": Philosophy which mixes pure principles with empirical ones does not deserve the name, for what distinguishes philosophy from common rational knowledge is its treatment in separate sciences of what is confusedly comprehended in such knowledge. Much less does it deserve the name of moral philosophy, since by this confusion it spoils the purity of morals themselves and works contrary to its own end. (Kant 1959, 6) Here, then, is a Kantian template for anti-psychologism. We require of philosophy an objectivity and universality that is incompatible with a methodology that begins with or tries to justify its conclusions by virtue of their agreement with psychological factors. As Kant revealingly says, we do not want logical or moral principles that apply only to human beings, but to all rational thinkers, in principle if not in fact. Even if there are no angels, demons, gods, a monotheistic God, or rational extraterrestrials, the principles of philosophy should be chosen and established, according to Kant, by a distinctively philosophical method as if, counterfactually, there were nonhuman rational agents to which such principles would also need to apply. 3. Psychologism in Kant's Anti-Psychologism We do not need to pursue this line of reasoning very far in order to see that there is something disingenous about Kant's rejection of psychologism. We should recall that Kant's own project in the Critique of Pure Reason begins with what he calls the Transcendental Aesthetic, which has its start ing place in sensation, in the experience of space, time, and objects within the sensible manifold, and interprets space and time as pure forms of intu ition (Kant 1965, A19-B73). Experience and intuition are obviously psychological concepts. So, it is not clear whether or in what sense Kant's critical idealism is supposed to be nonpsychological or nonanthropologi cal. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="4">264 DALE JACQUETTE A defender of Kant may want to say that Kant's transcendental method is intended to uncover synthetic a priori principles that would apply, in the case of the Transcendental Aesthetic, to any perceiver or rational agent, regardless of their human or nonhuman psychological nature. Regardless of the aspirations of critical idealism, I think that, in fact, Kant cannot possibly have access to the existence, structure, or other attributes of sensation, or basis for checking on his conclusions, beyond his own subjective psychological experience. What he can infer about the subjec tive experience of other human beings is always filtered through the prism of his own subjectivity (see Dorschel 1992; Bowie 1990; Hubbert 1993; Carr 1999). The same point might be made about anti-psychologistic objections to psychologism in general. I shall have more to say later about psychologism in other areas of philosophy. But to give an indication of the direction I want to go, I begin by casting a more critical light on Kant's objections to psychologism in logic. Kant complains that logic would not be logic if it were in any way empirical, in the precise sense of trying to make "univer sal and necessary laws of thinking . . . rest upon grounds taken from expe rience." Logic, Kant declares, must provide "a canon for understanding or reason which is valid for all thinking." Yet again, do we need to emphasize that understanding, reason, and thinking are all psychological faculties or occurrences? Why do we want to systematize logical inference in the first place, if not as a set of standards for guiding reasoning in our thinking psychological lives? It is commonplace that logic is not psychology, because logic is normative or prescriptive, providing, in Kant's words, a valid "canon" for reason or understanding, while psychology is descriptive of how thinkers actually reason. Yet even this hackneyed characterization of the distinction between logic and psychology will not bear close scrutiny. Do we not want to say that logic is at least descriptive of how some people sometimes think? If not, where could the normative standards in the logical canon possibly come from? A logic treatise or textbook can be seen in some ways as a description of a certain process of reasoning that its author has worked through and recommends to others (at least in the activity of writing it), and in that sense documents an episode of the author's psychology. How then, aside from the fact that such pronouncements have become well engrained in philosophical consciousness, can we nod assent to Kant's assertion in its full general ity, that "Logic can have no empirical part"? If logic is the theory of how we ought to think, it is no less a theory of how we ought to think, based on or judged to be compatible with how, when at our best, we actually do think. A normative or prescriptive conception of logic must minimally depend on assessments of how we are capable of thinking, determined empirically by experience of how we sometimes think, at least when we are teaching logic and writing logic textbooks. On what © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 265 other conceivable foundation, and with what other imaginable data, could the study of logic conceivably be based? In ethics, too, where he proposes to eliminate empirical influences and establish moral philosophy without the taint of psychology, anthropol ogy, or facts about "the nature of man," Kant formulates the Categorical Imperative in undisguisedly psychological terms. Despite the apparent variety of different versions of the principle, Kant writes that "there is, therefore, only one categorical imperative. It is: Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" (Kant 1959, 39). Here, in Kant's denunciation of psychology in ethics, we discover a clue to revisiting psychologism in all fields of philosophy. For, although Kant clearly wants to divorce moral philosophy from psychological factors involving pleasure, pain, happi ness or unhappiness and, in a word, inclination, he explicitly includes reference to the psychological concept of will, and the maxims it is possible or not possible for a rational moral agent to will as universal law. Nor does it help to argue that Kant's Categorical Imperative in refer ring to what an agent can or cannot will is speaking nonpsychologically about logical contradiction or noncontradiction. Anyone who has tried sympathetically to work through Kant's four examples of applying the Categorical Imperative - forbidding suicide, mandating the repayment of debt, developing one's natural talents, and contributing charitably to the welfare of others in greater need - will appreciate the loose sense in which Kant must speak of contradiction in effecting to squeeze concrete implications out of the Categorical Imperative. Kant invariably falls back on a comparison of psychological acts of will whose objects are incom patible, in that they cannot be jointly realized, in order to argue that an agent cannot consistently will the universalization of a morally indefen sible maxim (see Harrison 1957; Paton 1958; Swoyer 1983; Doore 1985). I have considered Kant's anti-psychologism at length because of its historical influence, and because he neatly encapsulates the main objec tions to psychologism. As Martin Kusch, in Psychologism: A Case Study in the Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge, has demonstrated, Kant is the source for much of the anti-psychologistic furor that swept the German academy in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Kusch 1995). Kant's anti-psychologism created an atmosphere of hostility toward psychological concepts in philosophy that also indirectly shaped contem porary Anglo-American analytic thought via the logic of Frege and Wittgenstein. A similar response occurs in the anti-psychologistic branch of contemporary continental philosophy, through Edmund Husserl's later transcendental phenomenology - especially in his objections to what he perceived as the latent psychologism in Brentano's early immanent inten tionally thesis in his 1874 Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt, and in the anti-psychologistic tendencies of Martin Heidegger's phenomeno © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="6">266 DALE JACQUETTE logical existentialism (see Rath 1994; Mohanty 1999, esp. 12-31, 79-109). I think it is significant that even Kant, despite his anti-psychologistic polemics, does not entirely free his own philosophy, even in its supposedly pure formulation, from psychological data, concepts, and principles. I am not trying to argue that Kant's anti-psychologism, which is at the root of two main anti-psychologistic traditions, is internally incoherent because it cannot consistently be put into practice. I think that Kant's objections, like most carefully thought-out criticisms of psychologism, are cogent and make an important point about the limitations and disadvantages of at least certain types of psychologism. What I am prepared to argue instead is that Kant's objections to psychologism, as representative of the suspicions of many critics of the psychological turn in philosophy, cannot be consis tently interpreted as preaching and practicing the elimination of all psychological elements from philosophy - from what Kant refers to as the formal philosophical disciplines of logic and metaphysics, and especially from epistemology and ethics. Kant's anti-psychologism, as I understand it, can only be consistently interpreted in the context of his philosophy as a whole, not as an objec tion to any and all psychological factors in philosophy, but as distin guishing between acceptable versus unacceptable psychological factors. Ultimately, I am inclined to say the same about any anti-psychologistic stance, whether or not it is directly inspired by Kant's. There are, so to speak, good psychological considerations that have a legitimate place in philosophy, and bad psychological considerations that are unpromising and in specific ways inadequate as philosophical principles. We need to distinguish between good psychologism and bad psychologism, between psychology that is good for philosophical purposes, and psychology that is bad for philosophical purposes. In the case of Kant's ethics, for example, inclination is a bad, harmful or theoretically useless psychological concept, while will is a good, helpful or useful psycho logical concept for the specific type of moral philosophy Kant is trying to develop.2 The same can be said, I believe, for anti-psychologistic crit icisms of psychological factors in logic, metaphysics, and epistemology. Thus, I am ready at last to issue a manifesto for revisiting psychologism, sorting out good from bad psychological factors in all three of these philosophical subdisciplines. 2 Kant 1959, 4: "In this way there arises the idea of a twofold metaphysics - a meta physics of nature and a metaphysics of morals. Physics, therefore, will have an empirical and also a rational part, and ethics likewise. In ethics, however, the empirical part may be called more specifically practical anthropology; the rational part, morals proper." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 267 4. Good and Bad Psychologism in Logic I shall begin with logic. It is not hard to find bad psychologism in this field. A concise statement of ways in which psychology probably should not be combined with logic is given by Alexander Maslow in his valuable commentary, A Study in Wittgenstein's Tractatus. Maslow writes: We must also understand that, while logic deals with symbols, it is not concerned with the actual psychological processes which may be going on in our minds when we deal with symbols. Identification of psychology with logic is due to the fallacy of psychologism: we find that in understanding certain logical principles we have to go through certain psychological experiences, and we conclude that the two are one and the same. For logic this coincidence is accidental and irrelevant. Many logicians were guilty of this fallacy; Boole held that logic dealt with "the nature and constitution of the human mind". But for Wittgenstein logic "results from the essence of the notation" (3.342), and not from the kind of material out of which the signs of our symbolism may happen to be made. Perhaps psychology may happen to have a special epistemological interest for us, but in a discussion of logic it has no privileged position. To give it a privileged position is a sheer metaphysical anthropomorphism. "Psychology is no nearer related to philosophy, than is any other natural science" (4.1121). The fallacy of psychologism in logic is due to the confusion of the validity of thought with certain logically accidental experiences always associated with correct thinking. A genetic account of logic is entirely irrele vant to the essence of logic. (Maslow 1961, 55) The "fallacy" of psychologism, according to Maslow, is the identifica tion of logic with psychology or "certain psychological experiences" that are irrelevant to the validity of inference, when logic is rightly interpreted as a system of symbols. This type of psychologism admittedly seems philosophically wrongheaded. But just because logic is not properly under stood as identical with any and all actual thought processes does not mean that logic cannot be understood as refined and abstracted from actual thought processes in a more philosophically respectable type of psycholo gism. It is in this spirit that George Boole, with whom Maslow associates the psychologistic fallacy, in An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities, explains that "the design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method . . (Boole 1959, 1). This does not strike me as irredeemably bad psychologism. Really bad psychologism in logic in the end might be nothing more than a straw man. Boole does not propose to describe how any particular choice of thinkers actually think, and then try to pass this off as logic, as the exaggerated criti cisms of anti-psychologists would often lead us to believe. Even psychology © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="8">268 DALE JACQUETTE as a general science is not limited to individual clinical histories, but strives to identify such concepts as the law of association or the principle of negative reinforcement. What Boole states as his method is similarly to study thinking empirically, specifically with an eye to abstracting the logical laws of deduc tively valid reasoning and the theory of probability. Thus, he writes "like all other sciences, that of the intellectual operations must primarily rest upon observation, — the subject of such observation being the very operations and processes of which we desire to determine the laws" (Boole 1959, 3). If Boole's method were simply to codify reasoning in psychological experience, however he happened to find it, and present that mishgamuh as a system of logic, then his efforts would certainly amount to bad psychologism. But that is not what he does, nor what he says he is going to do. It is not for nothing, after all, that Boole's research has been foun dational for contemporary mathematical logic and probability theory. The system he presents does not look much different from other pioneering formalizations of logic in the mid-nineteenth century, including those of logicians like Frege who are more self-consciously anti-psychologistic. Does Boole, then, simply misspeak in referring to his investigations as a study in the laws of thought? Is Boole a good logician, but a bad philoso pher of logic? I would say, on the contrary, that Boole is right to describe his target as the laws of thought, provided that with proper emphasis we understand his project as one of looking into the laws of thought, and not the accidental facts of psychology. If Boole's goal was merely to assimi late psychological facts irrespective of logically correct reasoning, then it would not make sense for Boole to maintain that, having derived the prin ciples of logic from the study of thought, he will finally use his system of logic in order to better understand the facts of psychology. For he says that it is part of his purpose, after his logic and theory of probability are in place, "to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind" (Boole 1959, 1; see Musgrave 1972). Boole, who for too long has been the poster boy for bad psychologism, is hard to categorize as guilty of this offense. There may well be logicians who have espoused bad psychologism. Yet their mistakes do not detract from the good psychologism of theorists like Boole who are engaged in a philosophically respectable project of discerning as laws of thought what ever is general and essential to logically correct inference in the empirical study of reasoning. Where else can or should logic begin? To deny with out qualification that logic has or should have anything to do with psychol ogy, as is the case with most popular anti-psychologistic rhetoric, surely goes too far. That is the sort of extreme position represented by formalism which, to a large extent, has been motivated by the desire to avoid psychologism in the philosophy of logic. But formalism is a controversial interpretation of logic, insofar as it presupposes games like rule-governed manipulation of meaningless symbols or uninterpreted syntax. It is unclear © Metaphiiosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 269 whether the concept of a meaningless symbol - a symbol that does not symbolize anything - is itself logically coherent, or whether tokens or types of marks on paper or similar objects could possibly qualify as syntax if or insofar as they are altogether uninterpreted.3 Even Wittgenstein (in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus), whom Maslow portrays as vehemently anti-psychologistic, does not regard any and every structure of potentially designating facts as genuine syntax. According to the picture theory of meaning, identity of logical form or mathematical multiplicity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for fact-picturing syntax; otherwise, the world would be as much a picture of language as language is supposed to be a picture of the world. As Maslow recognizes, Wittgenstein rejects bad psychologism, perhaps nowhere more harshly than in his review of Peter Coffey's book, The Science of Logic (Wittgenstein 1913). But Wittgenstein in Tractatus 3.11 also insists, in what I consider to be his good anti-formalistic psychologism, that "we use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible state of affairs. The method of projection is the thinking of the sense of the proposition" (Wittgenstein 1922). If formalism is diametrically opposed to any type of psychologism, including what I would call good psychologism, and if it is the only real alternative even to the least philosophically objectional psychologism, to psychologism on its best behavior, then I have no difficulty discounting formalism as a chal lenge to psychologism on grounds of material inadequacy. This problem affects all efforts to eliminate psychological factors from philosophical semantics by eliminating propositions as abstract entities in favor of properties and relations. It may be possible to eliminate proposi tions in favor of properties and relations, so that the meaning of a sentence token or type or statement made by means of a sentence is interpreted as representing relations of inclusion in and exclusion from the extensions of predicates. But such a reduction will not have purged all psychological elements from semantics if, as I am prepared to argue, a sentence, word, or other meaningful unit of discourse can only be understood as the expres sion of a thought, concept, or idea. Nor, for obvious reasons, is the situa tion improved if propositions are understood merely as truth value bearing sentences. Semantics presupposes ontology, but is not reducible to any ontology that does not include psychological, and especially intentional, properties and relations (see Heil 1981, 334; similar themes about the semantic impotence of "lifeless syntax" in the later Wittgenstein are devel oped by McGinn 1984, 17, 117-19). 3 I offer a more sustained attack on the philosophical underpinnings of formalism in philosophy of logic in Jacquette 1991.

Good and Bad Psychologism in Metaphysics I have devoted so much of my discussion to the problems of psychologism in logic, because this is the application that anti-psychologists have found most objectionable. It is therefore the area in which anti-psychologists have been most active, where they seem to believe psychologism is most vulner able, and in which it may be most important for psychologism to be defeated. But there is also good and bad psychologism in metaphysics, some conspicuous examples of which I want to examine, in order to explain how psychologism can go wrong and what prospects there may be for a philo sophically respectable partnership between psychology and metaphysics. An idealist metaphysics of the sort that G. W. F. Hegel championed in imagining that the world as spirit or self-consciousness is developing in distinct successive dialectical stages toward realization of the Absolute is perhaps as good an example as we need of the potential excesses of bad psychologism in ontology (Hegel 1968; see Hager 1974; Navickas 1976). George Berkeley's anti-materialism is probably next in line, interesting as it is in its own way to professional philosophers. By defining all existence as psychological, in the slogan esse est percipi aut posse percipere, Berkeley is committed - in what he evidently sees as an advantage of his theory over godless materialism - to the existence of God as an "infinite mind" that continuously perceives all sensible things that are only intermit tently perceived by our finite minds. The infinite mind of God is supposed to guarantee objectivity for the world of sensible entities construed as congeries of ideas, ectypally in human minds, and archetypally in God's infinite mind, in every dimension and from every perspective. Berkeley's psychologistic metaphysics has never attracted a serious following. Yet his idealism is an inevitable consequence of his uncompromising empiricism, in the desire to limit knowledge to sense experience. In this way Berkeley is led to conclude that all of reality exists psychologically, idealistically, in our minds and in the infinite mind of God (Berkeley 1949). We might also think of Spinoza in the Ethics, first defining the concept and then proving the existence of God as coextensive with the universe (Spinoza 1914). Or consider the teachings of the old Stoa, of Zeno of Elea and Chrysippus, arguing that godhead and the universe are identical, that the universe is a rational being with a rational purpose, and that ethics and politics can enable us to achieve tranquility by bringing our own desires and expectations into agreement with whatever events happen to transpire in the world as an expression of divine will (Zeno of Citium 1973, "Introduction," 13, 41-45; see Schofield 1983). The Stoics supported this psychologistic conclusion in metaphysics, among other ways, by arguing (in an inference also examined by Cicero in De Natura Deorum) that what ever is rational is greater than whatever is irrational, that nothing is greater than the universe, and that therefore the universe is rational (Cicero 1972, 201; Jacquette 1995). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 271 David Hume, in A Treatise of Human Nature, is as committed to empiri cism or the experimental method in the moral sciences as Berkeley. But without sharing Berkeley's theistic preoccupations, Hume reaches more skeptical conclusions about the impossibility of philosophically demon strating the existence of an external reality independent of thought (or of what Hume calls perceptions), of impressions of sensation and reflection, and of their faint psychological traces that remain as ideas. Hume takes up the slack left by the limitations of an empiricist philosophy by turning from reason to the passions, and affirming that where reason leaves off the imag ination is compelled to accept the existence of an external world. Here also, insofar as Hume can be described as a metaphysician, he tenders a psychol ogists metaphysics, based on the mind's faculties of perception and imag ination.4 Kant, in the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will be Able to Come Forward as Science, criticizes the rationalists as lacking a scientific method in metaphysics, and attacks empiricists like Berkeley and Hume as too skeptical, in the absence of collaborating sense experiences, about the existence of a mind-independent external world, the necessity of causation, and the existence of the self as a unified subject of experience (Kant 1977, 2-8). Kant hopes to overcome these limitations by defending transcendental reasoning as a method to recapture some of the prized conclusions of the rationalists, while still satisfying the empiricist's concern that pure reason divested of experiential content is inadequate in the search for truth (Kant 1977, 12-24; 69-90). And we have already seen that tran scendental reasoning in Kant's critical idealism is, in the most general sense (as I define the concept, despite Kant's disclaimers), equally psychologistic (see Jansohn 1969; Oliveira 1973; Jerrius 1984; Hubbert 1993). Philosophers attracted to Hegel's metaphysics, or Berkeley's, Spinoza's, or Zeno's, and recognize them as psychologistic, will naturally want to argue about whether their psychologisms are good or bad. For present purposes, I do not much care how they are evaluated, as long as the distinc tion between good and bad psychologism is taken seriously. I am offering my opinions, if you like, by way of illustration. But to continue in this vein, if Hegel's and Berkeley's philosophies exemplify bad psychologism, what 4 Hume 1978, 63-64: "'Twill probably be said, that my reasoning makes nothing to the matter in hand, and that I explain only the manner in which objects affect the senses, with out endeavouring to account for their real nature and operations. .. I answer this objection, by pleading guilty, and by confessing that my intention never was to penetrate into the nature of bodies, or explain the secret causes of their operations. For besides that this belongs not to my present purpose, I am afraid, that such an enterprize is beyond the reach of human understanding, and that we can never pretend to know body otherwise than by those external properties, which discover themselves to the senses." See Yolton 1984, 147-64; Baier 1991, 101-28. A controversy concerning the interpretation of Hume's real ism versus pyrrhonic skepticism about perception of the external world appears in the many references to some of the voluminous secondary literature on this topic in Wilson 1989, Livingston 1991, Wilson 1991. Important earlier works for understanding this exchange include Price 1940 and Popkin 1966. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="12">272 DALE JACQUETTE sort of good psychologism, if any, might we say has a place in meta physics? From what I have argued so far, perhaps Hume's, perhaps Kant's. I am not supposing that good or bad psychologism in metaphysics or the other branches of philosophy needs to take any single form. I shall not try to develop the idea much further here, except to point to what I find posi tive in Nicholas Rescher's discussion of ontology in his recent study, Objectivity: The Obligations of Impersonal Reason. Rescher defines objectivity not as mind-independence in any absolute sense, but as an abstraction from the cognitive limitations and evaluative interests inherent in any particular subjective experience of the world. Rescher argues that "objectivity is 'impersonal' and 'impartial' not by way of dehumanization but by way of abstracting from those idiosyncracies that stand in the way of someone's doing what 'any of us' - any rational, reasonable, sensible, normal person - would do in one's place" (Rescher 1997, 7-8). He continues: "To strive for objectivity is to seek to put things in such a way that not just kindred spirits but virtually anyone can see the sense of it. It is not so much a matter of being impersonal as impartial - of putting aside one's idiosyncratic predilections and parochial preferences in forming one's beliefs, evaluations, and choices" (Rescher 1997, 8). In applying this to metaphysics, Rescher acknowledges what I would call the good psychologistic implications of ontological objectivity, stating that "in the end, our commitment to ontological objectivity rests on the idealistic foundation of a mind-projected postulation ['from the presently available data base' of limited finitely experienced properties of physical objects 'to a completed or ideally perfected data base'] whose validation is, in the end, functional and pragmatic, validated in the first instance not by evidence but by considerations of utility" (Rescher 1997, 115). According to Rescher's definition of objectivity, the commitment of an objective meta physics to a mind-independent reality is itself idealistic and mind projected. Indeed, I feel compelled to ask rhetorically in support of Rescher's conclusion, how could it be otherwise? 6. Good and Bad Psychologism in Epistemology My final example concerns good psychologism in epistemology. An illus tration of bad psychologism in the theory of knowledge is harder to find. Knowledge is a specially qualified state of mind, often construed as some type of justified true belief, so that psychology may be inseparable from epistemology. I suggest, however, that Descartes's epistemology in Meditations on First Philosophy is an instance of bad psychologism. By this I mean that, together with its rationalist proof for the existence of God as no deceiver, Descartes errs in interpreting clear and distinct belief states as constituting epistemically certain knowledge by virtue of their psycho logical character as revealed by introspection. The bad psychologism in Descartes's epistemology is not necessarily the only, or even the worst, © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 273 defect from which his philosophical system suffers, but is relevant to the present discussion because it tries to elevate the psychological determina tion of properties of psychological states to a criterion of truth and knowl edge, referred to by Descartes as the accurate representation of external reality (Descartes 1984, II; see Caton 1973). By contrast, good psychologism in epistemology can be found in W. V. O. Quine's landmark essay, "Epistemology Naturalized." Quine makes epistemology a branch of psychology in this famous passage: Philosophers have rightly despaired of translating everything into observa tional and logico-mathematical terms. They have despaired of this even when they have not recognized, as the reason for this irreducibility, that the state ments largely do not have their private bundles of empirical consequences. And some philosophers have seen in this irreducibility the bankruptcy of epistemology...But I think that at this point it may be more useful to say rather that epistemology still goes on, though in a new setting and a clarified status. Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chap ter of psychology and hence of natural science. (Quine 1969, 82; see Kornblith 1985; Shimony and Nails 1987; Duran 1994) In somewhat the same way that Boole proposes to gather the princi ples of logic from psychology, and then use logic to shed light on psychology, Quine similarly suggests that when epistemology is consid ered a branch of psychology among the natural sciences, it can also be used to understand the methodology of science, including psychology. Quine remarks: The old epistemology aspired to contain, in a sense, natural science; it would construct it somehow from sense data. Epistemology in its new setting, conversely, is contained in natural science, as a chapter of psychology. But the old containment remains valid too, in its way. We are studying how the human subject of our study posits bodies and projects his physics from his data, and we appreciate that our position in the world is just like his. Our very epistemological enterprise, therefore, and the psychology wherein psychol ogy is a component book - all this is our own construction or projection from stimulations like those we were meting out to our epistemological subject. There is thus reciprocal containment, though containment in different senses: epistemology in natural science and natural science in epistemology. (Quine 1969, 83) I shall not enter into greater detail in defense of good psychologism in Quine's epistemology naturalized. That it is psychologism in the sense I have defined is obvious enough. What I mean by describing Quine as recommending a good psychologism is that I believe he is right to inter pret knowledge seeking as a partly psychological activity undertaken by psychological subjects - that can then be studied as a psychological phenomenon and improved in its methods, by abstracting and refining © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="14">274 DALE JACQUETTE epistemic principles from the knowledge-validating procedures in which we engage. As I see it, the situation in Quine's advocacy of epistemology natural ized is rather like Boole's attitude toward the empirical investigation of the principles of deductive inference and probability judgments in formal symbolic logic. We begin, as we must in this formula for good psycholo gism, with an intellectual pursuit: investigating first-person subjective psychological experience and the reports of subjective psychological expe riences of other persons, in their efforts to master effective reasoning and perfect their understanding in knowledge. The principles or laws of logic and epistemology that are discovered in this way are then abstracted and refined from particular experience, ideally in the way that Rescher describes in metaphysics. They can be interpreted as a projection in which we try to identify what is essential and look beyond whatever is peculiar or idiosyncratic to any individual subjective psychology - or even to whatever is specifically human - in order to clarify a priori concepts and develop more generalized philosophical methods that tran scend the limits of any particular type of psychology. 7. Toward New Paradigms of Psychologism To begin and end with the limitations of any particular psychology or type of psychology in philosophy is bad psychologism, whether in logic, meta physics, epistemology, ethics or aesthetics. But to conclude that because some psychologism is or can be bad, therefore all psychologism is bad, or that psychology has no place whatsoever in philosophy, is bad metaphi losophy. The word psychologism has acquired such negative connotations that I doubt whether many of the philosophers I have mentioned would appre ciate being classified as advocating any form of psychologism, including what I have called "good psychologism." Yet that, by my definition, is precisely what Rescher, Quine, and others are doing, albeit in different ways. There are unlimited opportunities for elaborating good psychologis ts philosophies. I have argued that it is a fundamental mistake to suppose that we can or should try to do entirely without psychological considera tions in philosophy. An anti-psychologism that is not merely a criticism of bad psychologism, but that also takes issue with psychology in any form in philosophy, is misdirected and self-defeating. I have barely taken the first steps here in discriminating between good and bad psychologisms, let alone indicating how a good psychologism ought to be developed in logic, metaphysics, and epistemology. I will be satisfied if I am perceived as having said at least something convincing by way of distinguishing between good and bad psychologism, and thus indicating the possibility of a good psychologism with virtues and advantages that are worth considering, especially in light of the most © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 2001</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGISM IN LOGIC, METAPHYSICS, AND EPISTEMOLOGY 275 virulent anti-psychologisms that persist in philosophy. If my conclusions are correct, then no one who is conscientious about the proper conduct of philosophy can afford to blithely turn the page on psychologism and assume, as many of its detractors have done, that psychologism is dead and buried, never to be resurrected. I have suggested, on the contrary, that psychologism needs to be revisited in more significant and rigorous ways.5 Department of Philosophy The Pennsylvania State University 246 Sparks Building University Park, PA 16802 USA dalej4@yahoo. com References Baier, Annette.
