INTRODUCTION The island of Borneo has maintained until fairly recently a number of tropical rain forest hunting-gathering groups, generally referred to as Punan or Penan (though other local ethnonyms are found). Today, a large proportion of them have switched to a part ly settled way of life and some form of agriculture, but even these groups still rely heavily on the forest, collecting jungle products for trade and, often, processing the wild sago palms for their subsistence while collecting. The Bukat, one of these partly settled groups, are found (see Map 1) in Indonesia's West Kalimantan (three hamlets, totalling 300 persons) and East Kalimantan (one hamlet of 150), and in Malaysia's Sarawak (one hamlet of 150). This paper focuses on one of the Bukat communities of West Kalimantan.1 It is based on a short manuscript in Indonesian entitled Kisah rakyat tentang "Sebab-sebab terjadinya/terdapatnya benda-benda tua di Kampung Nanga Balang". This manu script, dated 12 December 1982, was written by Sawing Gemala, a Bukat notable of the tiny hamlet of Nanga Balang, on the uppermost reaches of the Kapuas River (district of Putussibau, regency of Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan).2 The manuscript includes introductory notes by Sawing (see 2.1 and 2.2 below), the text of a Bukat legend (the first two paragraphs of 2.3), and Sawing's comments (the rest of 2.3, and the following two sections). As my translation of the Indonesian text tries to remain close to the original, it may appear clumsy or heavy. Parentheses enclose original elements of the text, while brackets enclose my editing notes. I have kept Sawing's original freehand sketch map of the site of Nanga Balang but transla tions of captions and orientation of sketch map are mine (see Map 2). I found this manuscript interesting because I have personally met Sawing, and because his reading of the legend and his comments on Bukat history, as revealed in this text, obviously stray from the information he offered in the course of a series of interviews. The legend's implications also contradict notably what I know of Bukat history from other sources.3 !0n the history of the Bukat, see B. Sellato, Nomades et s?dentarisation ? Born?o ? Histoire ?conomi que et sociale (Paris: Editions de l'EHESS, Etudes Insulindiennes/Archipel, no. 9, 1989), pp. 35-108. Michael Heppell has also carried out a study of the Bukat of Sarawak. 2A copy of this manuscript of five pages (including one page bearing a sketchmap of the location of Nanga Balang) was lent to me by Dr. Mudiyono Diposiswoyo, Dean of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIPOL) of Tanjungpura University (UNTAN) in Pontianak, in April 1990. 3The text refers to the history of the Bukat nomads of West Kalimantan, the subject of lengthy sections of my dissertation and subsequent book. See B. Sellato, "Les nomades forestiers de Born?o et la s?dentarisa tion: essai d'histoire ?conomique et sociale" (Ph.D. thesis, EHESS, Paris, 1986, 570 pp.) and Sellato, Nomades et s?dentarisation. 18</page><page sequence="2">Map 1.

While these artifacts evidently point at some real historical episode, the Bukat legend, in a first stage, provides an interpretation of the artifacts, manipulating the historical tradition to fit certain purposes of the times when it was elaborated. Sawing's reading of the legend and comments on Bukat history constitute a second stage of manipulation, leading to other conclusions, meant to fit better the Bukat's current (1982) social-economic situation. It is not the goal of this paper to discuss theoretical issues or to establish the com parative or theoretical significance of the data presented. It is commonplace to state that people manipulate their historical tradition for cultural or political reasons and much has been written about this subject (for example, R. Renaldo on the Ilongot or M. Sahlins on Hawaii, .and the growing literature on the "invention of tradition"). This paper only attempts to provide, in a restrictedly regional cultural context, an inter pretative analysis of the Bukat's manipulations of historical tradition in the context of their changing circumstances. The manipulation here sets into motion several combined mechanisms. The legend comes up with a sort of myth of origin meant to legitimize the nomadic way of life and improve the nomadic Bukat's low status in the eyes of their farming neighbours. Sawing, drawing a posteriori on the Christian teachings in his reinterpretation of the legend and of Bukat cultural history, makes the point, in a similar attempt to upgrade the nomadic Bukat's status, that they are better Christians than the farmers. A recently introduced world religion here provides new means to strengthen the ethnic and cultural identity of a hunting-gathering group. In the process the problem emerges, however, that the Bukat have been progressively abandoning the nomadic way of life in the last few decades and Sawing, obviously un comfortable about this, attempts at the same time to re-appropriate the rich ancient culture of Nanga Balang for the sake of the now partly-settled Bukat's current prestige. As I, in turn, reinterpret the legend and pull apart Sawing's comments, I am in fact led to the conclusion that there is no ancient connection whatsoever between the Bukat and the artifacts unearthed at Nanga Balang. I believe we have here a rare clear Southeast Asian example ? and in written form ? of an in-the-process manipulation of the historical tradition by a hunting-gathering society, in a multi-staged sequence involving ancient and modern factors of a different nature ? political, cultural, and religious ? and displaying internal contradictions that are to be related to the ongoing alteration of the mode of subsistence, from forest hunting-gathering to swidden agriculture. 2. SAWING GEMALA'S BUKAT MANUSCRIPT (Translation) A Popular Account of the Reasons for the Origin and Existence of Old Artifacts in Nanga Balang (see Appendix for the Indonesian text) [2.1] "Introduction "Ancient artifacts might be of a high value although their appearance may not be very attractive, and they might also have a high scientific value. Thus, their discovery is an interesting event. These old things are usually found in old regions [i.e., regions</page><page sequence="4">Cultural Identity Among Hunter-Gatherers in Borneo 21 known as having a long history of human settlement]. But why are they found in the upper Kapuas [River basin], and precisely the uppermost region (considered a back ward area)? Because I was attracted to this fact, I tried to commit to writing the following Bukat legend. [2.2] "Origin of the name Nanga Balang "In a remote past, there was a Bukat village on the upper Kapuas River. It had a very strategic location, for it was the ideal place for people travelling up and down the upper Kapuas to stop over and rest. For travellers going upriver, it is [nowadays] the [last] place where they can procure all [gear and food] they still lack before departing; for those going downstream, it is the most appropriate place to relax after a scary canoe ride [see sketch map]. "Not far from the village, there is a hill, with its peak pointing up like a bottleneck (bottle is balang in Bukat). It is called Balang Hill. The Balang River flows down along its flank to the Kapuas River where, opposite the confluence, there is an island, Balang Island. The Bukat village, jusi downstream from the confluence, is called Nanga Balang. [2.3] "The victory of the kensurai tree "Once upon a time [in Nanga Balang], there was an elder by the name of Pak Halangi, who is acknowledged as one of the ancestors of the Bukat of the Kapuas. As an elder, Pak Halangi was often seen resting on the river bank, watching the canoe traffic in front of the village. He made himself more comfortable by sitting in a rattan seat hanging from the branches of a biyu tree, which grew [just] across the river from the upstream end of Balang Island. "One day, resting in his seat, he noticed a splendid red flower swaying on the op posite bank. He said to himself: 'What a beautiful flower. Could it be that my best clothes, if I wear them, would be less beautiful than this flower?' The flower was that of the kensurai tree. Pak Halangi went back home, and put on all his best clothes, then returned to his swinging seat. 'Let's make a contest', he said [talking to the tree], 'to see which is more beautiful, the colour of your flower or my clothes.' "He sat there a long time, alternately watching his clothes and the kensurai flower. After a long time, he bravely recognized that his clothes were not as beautiful as the colour of the flower. He began to hate his clothes, and he threw them away, with his jewellery, and all his daily tools and implements. Where Pak Halangi went afterwards is not told. "The legend says that the ancient artifacts found at Nanga Balang are the things Pak Halangi threw away after his defeat. To this day, whenever we dig the ground here, we find some, though often in a poor condition. To this day, the kensurai trees abound along the banks of the upper Kapuas River, whereas they are rare downstream. The artifacts found at Nanga Balang include: a stone in the shape of a penis, necklaces of beads, gold bracelets and rings, gold nuggets, stone axes, and shards of tempayan jars. If we dig only a half-metre or one metre, we surely find some objects, at least glass [here, ceramic] shards. It's not far, just in front of the houses. "The biyu tree of the legend has died, and a new tree has stemmed from the old stump. But a very strong sengkuang tree also grows there, overshadowing the biyu tree.</page><page sequence="5">c 1 GO t? JS CQ cd ?o t? cd ti?i O (U go CD 43 03 ? 43 O +-&gt; (D 44 GO + O) O?

[2.4] "Author's comments "From this legend, we gather that a Buddhist-like [sic] culture flourished long ago at Nanga Balang. At some point, a new culture (perhaps Moslem or Christian) arrived and suppressed the influence of the ancient one. When they adopted the new culture, the ancestors of the Bukat left the legend for their descendants. They buried the ancient artifacts so that they would not be damaged by the adherents to the new culture, and so that their descendants could find them, either to utilize or to study them. "By burying these things, they meant to give advice [to their descendants]: (1) What ever is made by God Almighty will be more perfect than what is made by Man (the kensurai flower is more beautiful than Pak Halangi's clothes and jewels). (2) Don't be impressed by other people's riches, live simply (Pak Halangi was impressed by the flower's beauty, he destroyed his property); (3) Act with nobleness; if God wills it, of course we will be defeated; we must bravely accept our defeat, and not slyly try to take revenge (Pak Halangi admitted honestly and nobly his defeat; he threw away his belongings but did nothing to the tree). "Besides, Pak Halangi meant to allow his descendants to adhere to the new culture, but with the hope that the old culture would not be totally damaged, because it might be needed some time (he threw away his belongings, but without destroying them, so that they might be found, and perhaps utilized, by others). It is not impossible that, in the future, this old culture would attract specialists who would study it. However, for this to happen, we all should take steps to make the existence of ancient artifacts in Nanga Balang known to the public. [2.5] "Conclusion "Such is the story of our old artifacts. Whether the reader believes it or not, he is always welcome to see for himself. But please be careful if you dig here, for you might dig up something of great historic-cultural value. Please forgive all my shortcomings. " [Here the manuscript ends]. 3. THE BUKAT AND NANGA BALANG: HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION Before beginning an analysis of the text, it is important to reassess the historical setting to which it refers. First, Sawing's background and the Bukat's recent history, including their settlement at Nanga Balang, are outlined. Second, available archaeo logical data about the site of Nanga Balang is reviewed. Third, a reconstruction of the history of various Bukat bands which might have lived at Nanga Balang in a distant past is proposed. Then, a general outline of the culture history in a wider regional set ting is given. Finally, the question is addressed of who, really, lived at Nanga Balang and left the artifacts mentioned in the manuscript. 3.1 The Bukat of Nanga Balang Sawing is one of the sons of Gemala (or Gembala), the old Temenggong (a title conferred by the Dutch administration) of the Bukat of the upper Kapuas. During the</page><page sequence="7">24 Bernard Sellato decade 1960-70, the Bukat (probably less than 200 people) gathered in a single village, Metelunai (Map 3), under the leaders Narok (son of Sekudan) and Gemala (son of Nyeparin). However, in the early 1960s, Sawing moved with two or three families down the Kapuas River to settle at Nanga Balang. A visitor4 mentions this settlement at Liu Daro (Long Island, that is, Liu Balang or Balang Island, at the confluence of the Balang River; see Sawing's sketch map). The tiny settlement of Nanga Balang welcomed a few families of Kereho (or Punan Keriau, another neighbouring nomadic group). Wariso5 probably visited it, then King6 in the early 1970s, and Ding Ngo7 counted five houses there. In 1981 there were six houses:8 three of Kereho, two of Bukat (including Sawing's), and one of Senganan (a group of upstream Islamized people). The hamlet of Nanga Balang was then included in the community (desa, the smallest administrative unit) of Metelunai. In this manuscript (dated 1982), Sawing calls himself headman (kepala kampung) of Nanga Balang (and not mayor, kepala desa). My estimate for Nanga Balang's Bukat population was, at the most, 20 to 25 persons. Whereas the Bukat of Metelunai were still relying heavily on wild sago, commercial collecting, and gold pan ning, along with some marginal paddy farming, those of Nanga Balang were living in more "settled" economic conditions. 3.2 The Available Archaeological Data It seems that no thorough archaeological investigation has ever been carried out at Nanga Balang. In 1971 a government team briefly visited this site, along with many others in West Kalimantan, and collected artifacts, presumably from the local popula tion.9 Most artifacts are kept at the museum in Pontianak. Some pieces of decorated earthenware sent to Jakarta have since been lost. A superficial report was produced,10 from which the following information is extracted. The artifacts originating from Nanga Balang and described in that report include sixteen stone tools of varying shapes and sections. Their sizes range from 6 to some 13 cm. One (a fragment) is obviously chipped, while the rest are polished, most of them rather roughly. Only one of the polished tools seems quadrangular in section, the rest showing a lenticular section. The cutting edge is either straight or convex, and assym metrical (one face sharper than the other). The shape and size of the tools would hint 4Baling Avun (A manuscript map of villages of the upper Kapuas), 1961 (my grateful thanks to J?r?me Rousseau for making this document available to me). 5R.A.M.

No p?trographie indication is given besides the (dark grey) colour. Earthenware shards were also collected, some with geometric motifs (not shown in the plates). The shards are thick, but made of a very fine smooth material. A stone lingga "of a normal size" (sic; according to the scale it would be some 13 cm long) shows at its base a square grid of incisions. Though displaying a clear phallic shape, this is definitely an utilitarian object, either a pottery paddle, as is suggested in the report, or maybe a barkcloth beater. Other spherical stones also with an incised grid might be beaters as well. A so-called grinder and its mortar, of unconvincing shapes and found far apart, might just be natural stones or, perhaps, were used to shape clay pots. What are called a stone tablet with incised lines and a block in the shape of a goat head could as well be natural forms. No metal implements are mentioned. 3.3 History of the Upper Kapuas Bukat The main character in the legend told in this manuscript is a man named Halangi, a chieftain at Nanga Balang and a forebear of the Bukat. He is called a leader (pemuka; the use of this term instead of one referring to some form of aristocracy is congruent with the Bukat's consistent denial of any formal social stratification). The objects that Halangi discards suggest that the village was populated by agriculturalists, who were rich with gold ornaments, and the holders of a sophisticated material and spiritual culture. The fact that only stone tools were found might imply that they had not yet acquired iron implements. What is known of the culture history of the Bukat rebuts the legend's claim to a sophisticated farmers' culture. Bukat informants, particularly old Gemala, affirm rather proudly that the Bukat have always been forest nomads.. The Bukat originated, according to informants, in the Mendalam (or Bukot) and Sibau Rivers area.11 Nanga Balang is located some distance above the first rapids of the Kapuas, within the nomads' traditional territory (see Map 3). But this section of the Kapuas River was the limit between Punan (i.e., Hovongan and Kereho) and Bukat territories, and the Bukat were in a situation of long-lasting hostility with the Punan. The nomadic Bukat, for that reason, hardly ever came to live near the banks of the Kapuas before the twentieth century (except on headhunting raids and during the Kayan-Taman war; see 3.5). No settled, or even semi-settled, Bukat village ever existed anywhere on this section of the Kapuas before 1910.12 So it is most probable that the people who left these artifacts at Nanga Balang were not settled Bukat farmers. Besides, Halangi is the name of a subgroup of the Bukat, a nomadic band living ca. 1840 on the upper Baleh River in Sarawak (see Map 3). I have suggested13 that the nThe Bukat, in contrast with a number of other nomadic forest groups of Borneo, claim to have main tained through time their autonym (really B?ket, where e stands for a nasalized /0/), derived from the Bukat name of the Mendalam River, their centre of origin. Though their nomadic bands separately ranged around widely, the Bukat have always defined their ethnic identity quite sharply in contrast with the other three groups of forest nomads of the upper Kapuas area, with whom there was permanent hostility. See also a series of 14 articles by A. B?cher in The Djakarta Times (1970). 12See Sellato, Nomades et s?dentarisation. 13Ibid., pp. 45-46.</page><page sequence="10">Cultural Identity Among Hunter-Gatherers in Borneo 27 name Halangi could be that of either the Langei or the Jalangi Rivers, left-bank tribu taries of the upper Baleh, but it might well be that it was a band chieftain's name before, or instead of, being a toponym. The Halangi band (known as Ukit, an exonym for the Bukat in the Baleh area) left Sarawak around 1850, resided some time at the sources of the Kapuas, and went overland, in a circular movement, to join other Bukat on the Mendalam. As far as I am aware, this Halangi band never lived in the Nanga Balang area. This does not preclude, as these nomadic Bukat travelled extensively, that a man named Halangi (whoever he might have been) might have been sitting, one lazy day, watching flowers at the confluence of the Balang River. 3.4 An Outline of Regional History Contrary to what many scholars may believe, Borneo offers scores of archaeological sites, even in its far hinterlands, and one can only regret that so little attention has been granted to an island whose history is crucial in Southeast Asia. Hardly any of these sites have been excavated, besides a few famous ones in Sarawak. At Tanjung Lokang, a Hovongan (or Punan Bungan, another formerly nomadic group) settlement on the Bungan River, one of the uppermost tributaries of the Kapuas (see Map 4), people preparing an airstrip in the early 1980s unearthed a hoard of artifacts very similar to those of Nanga Balang (necklaces, bracelets, rings, beads, stone axes, and plenty of pottery shards). Again, no metal artifacts were mentioned by informants. These two sites, and others in the same region, still remain to be scientifically excavated. As Sawing writes, you just have to dig down two to three feet in front of the village houses. Other sites in West Kalimantan are briefly described by Goenadi et al.14 Some of them, in the regency of Kapuas Hulu, have yielded ceramic plates or shards thereof. Further downstream along the middle Kapuas River, in the regency of Sintang, several lingga ? including one with a carved face of Shiva (mukhalinga) and a basal yoni ? are found, also large stone tools and anthropomorphic stone statues. Near Sanggau, inscriptions have been reported, both Hindu and Buddhist, as well as stone statues of Nandi bulls and Ganesha, and a bronze statue of Shiva with four arms.15 At the northwestern tip of the island, several hoards of gold objects were excavated, some at tributed to a Tantric Buddhist cult.16 14Goenadi, Laporan. 15See F.D.K.

To the east, on the Mahakam River, a number of stone Nandi bulls had been placed at the sites of important settlements by the Pin groups (who lived along the Mahakam before the Kayan invasion); one can still be seen in situ. Also in East Kalimantan, inscribed yupas (in Pallava script; fourth or fifth century A.D.), gold jewellery, stone statues of Hindu gods and Boddhisatvas (ca tenth century), and a bronze Buddha were discovered.18 Thus, it is clear that Indian cultural influence, at least in some of its visual mani festations, reached quite far inland up Borneo's major rivers. As the uppermost Kapuas region is rich in gold and forest products, this should not be surprising. Networks of trade ? and, along with it, cultural interaction ? probably induced the emergence there of supra-tribal polities in the form of petty trading kingdoms. According to the region, this Indian influence appears to have been either Shivaist or Buddhist. Among the artifacts found at the site of Nanga Balang, the presence of gold jewellery (if not that of the phallic stone) might be interpreted as an unambiguous clue to such in fluence. If Indian influence reached the coasts of Borneo in the fourth or fifth century A.D.,19 it most probably took several centuries to diffuse to the populations of the far interior. In any case, western Borneo later came under the influence of the Hindu Javanese kingdom of Majapahit (around 1350). Similarly Islam, known to have reached the coastal regions of West Kalimantan in the mid-sixteenth century, probably did not diffuse to Putussibau before the first half of the eighteenth century.20 Catholic mis sionaries established themselves near Putussibau in 1924, and it probably took another couple of decades before they actually started converting the Bukat. To my knowledge, none of the sites mentioned above has yielded metals (that is, other than gold), with the exception of the two bronze statues mentioned above. Although metal (bronze and iron) technology might have reached certain points of Borneo's coasts around 2000 B.c., we know that notable iron production in Borneo only started in the tenth century A.D.21 and was widespread only among a few inland groups (e.g., the Iban and Kayan), and probably not earlier than the fifteenth century. Neither of these groups was present on the uppermost reaches of the Kapuas at any time before the early nineteenth century. Most inland groups went on using a Neolithic 17E.L.M.

As the Bukat cannot be retained as the original owners of the artifacts of Nanga Balang, we should look for other, more plausible candidates. We know that the Kayan coalition army under Liju Li' ? the chief of the Long-Gelat group, known as the Dayak Napol?on in the Dutch literature ? came over from the upper Mahakam River around 1830 to wage war on the Taman and Ot Danum groups of the upper Kapuas.23 Oral tradition has it that Liju made swiddens at the confluence of the Muti River.24 This confluence is located just across the Kapuas from Nanga Balang. There might have been in this area (Muti-Balang) a logistic settlement for Liju's armies. As Sawing states, this area is strategically located, just above the first rapids (see Map 3). Beyond the reach of attacks from downstream, it is an ideal starting point for launch ing an all-out sweeping offensive. The same oral tradition contends that Liju put some of the local nomadic groups (Kereho, Hovongan, Bukat) to work to help make swiddens. The Kayan generally had good relations with the nomads25 and I have suggested that Liju's Bukat were nomads from the Mendalam River, who were already acquainted in trade with the Kayan of the Mendalam prior to Liju's attack;26 part of them probably resumed their associa tion afterwards. We know that the Halangi band, when they left Sarawak, joined the Belatung band of the Mendalam (ca. 1850), and then we never hear about the Halangi again. But among the Bukat who left the Mendalam in the 1910s and finally settled in Metelunai in the 1960s was the Belatung subgroup, to which Gemala belongs.27 If it were to be speculated that some of Liju's Bukat, after going back to the Mendalam, left again in the 1830s for the Baleh River basin to become the Halangi band, then Sawing might truly count among his direct ancestors some of the Bukat who stayed 22For example, Harrisson, "Prehistory". 23See A.W.

Other peoples have passed through this area after Liju. Some Kayan, the Uma' Pagung, came from Sarawak to the upper Kapuas River basin probably just before, or during the Great Kayan Expedition of 1863 and settled in the 1870s at Nanga Tukung (near present-day Nanga Ira'). They probably came via the sources of the Kapuas and may have first resided at Nanga Hakat (near present-day Metelunai) and later other places, like Nanga Balang. These episodes, however, seem too recent, and several features of the Long-Gelat and Kayan culture do not fit the artifacts excavated at Nanga Balang. First, the Long Gelat and Kayan did have iron implements and they were even famous for their sophisticated ironsmith work, unrivalled in Southeast Asia. Their mastery of iron technology was probably a major factor in their military conquest of, and cultural dominance over, large territories in central Borneo. Conversely, they are not known to have ever worked precious metals, gold or silver (unlike some groups of the Kapuas, like the Taman or Maloh). There is not much evidence of Indian influence in their culture. Furthermore, these groups displayed a tightly stratified type of social organiza tion, featuring three basic categories (aristocrats, commoners, and slaves28), which does not seem to fit the image of the Nanga Balang people in the Bukat legend. We should investigate further back in history. When the Mahakam Kayan and Long-Gelat, arriving from the Apo Kayan Plateau in the north (see Map 4), started conquering the upper Mahakam region in the second half of the eighteenth century,29 the local populations (the Pin, a set of groups related to the Ot Danum) scattered, mostly across to the Barito River basin and downstream to the middle Mahakam area.30 Some of these Pin, the Pin Bawan (and maybe others as well), fled across the M?ller Mts.31 around 1800 or 1810. They resided some time on the Bungan River, went across to, and then down, the Keriau River to the Kapuas, to cross overland again and settle on the upper Mandai River. These people, now called Orung Da'an, are the same people as the Ot Danum living on the upper Melawi River. Indeed, some groups went back and forth across the water divide between Kapuas and Melawi, particularly when Liju's armies swept the upper Kapuas.32 There might have been other such Pin or Ot Danum subgroups in the Kapuas area prior to the exodus from the Mahakam (and it may be that some of today's Taman are former Pin). The Ot Danum and Pin cultural setting is far more in accord with the artifacts found in Nanga Balang. The people who lived in Tanjung Lokang and in Nanga Balang might very well have belonged to the same ethnic group. They were part of what I have called the Barito Culture,33 presumably covering the island widely before 28See for example, J.

As stated above, in the most isolated regions ? and the uppermost Kapuas area is one ? some groups maintained these cultural features until fairly recently. I would conclude that the artifacts found at Nanga Balang should be attributed to some residing or transiting Hindu-influenced Ot Danum or Pin populations (at the latest around 1810 or 1820, perhaps earlier in the eighteenth century), and definitely not to the Bukat ? as the legend assumes it ? not even during that episode where they were associated with the Kayan (the Kayan war and subsequent presence on the Kapuas, 1830-40). 4. LEGEND AND HISTORY: MANIPULATIONS OF THE TRADITION Sawing struck me in 1981 as a no-nonsense, open, and intelligent individual, a leader with some education, ideas of his own, and substantial initiative. He proved a valuable and reliable informant, and I have no doubt that he knew for certain that the Bukat of his father Gemala's generation had grown up as hunter-gatherers, as Gemala himself had also made clear to me. But his plural identity, as a Bukat, as a Christian, and now also as a settled nomad, entails in the modern context certain specific views about his group's history. 4.1 The Legend and Sawing: Interpretation and Reinterpretation I believe it is irrelevant to oppose, in terms of the general process of historical manipulation, the legend ? an allegedly "collective" creation whose origin and inven tors are lost in the mists of the past ? to Sawing's highly personal, "intellectual" ex plication. Irrespective of whether the origin of a legend or of its reinterpretation can be traced to particular individuals, insofar as the group, for a specific purpose or con venience, espouses the views offered, it is society as a whole that participates in the manipulation of history. The legend's age is not clear. The Bukat who lived with Liju at Nanga Balang left in the 1830s and no Bukat community ever settled there again before the early 1960s. Some Bukat may have camped there any time between these dates, but it is unlikely that they dug the ground at Nanga Balang before the 1910s, when the very first at tempts at swidden farming were made. Thus, we have three options: (i) The Bukat discovered the artifacts for the first time between the 1910s and the 1960s while farm ing, or even around 1960 when building the village; (ii) they heard about the discovery of the artifacts from other groups (some Kayan?) who happened to farm there in the nineteenth century; (iii) they retained some memory of an early discovery, dating back to the times they were living there in the 1830s. However ancient the Bukat's know 34See B. Sellato, "The Punan Question and the Reconstruction of Borneo's Culture History", in Change and Development in Borneo, ed. V.H. Sutlive, Jr. (Williamsburg, VA: Studies in Third World Societies, in press).</page><page sequence="16">Cultural Identity Among Hunter-Gatherers in Borneo 33 ledge of these artifacts is, I would tend to believe that this legend is a fairly new elaboration. Both the legend and Sawing's comments, relying on a different set of available materials, offer cultural constructions or reconstructions in the form of cultural, polit ical, or religious statements (see Table 1). Let us first focus on the legend itself. The kensurai-?ov/er story seems to offer two cultural-political statements. One addresses the neighbouring, farming ethnic groups: "We Bukat used to be rich and settled [farmers], like all of you; therefore you have no ground for looking down on us. " The second functions as a myth of cultural origin, legitimizing the nomadic way of life: "Long ago, we [our ancestor Halangi] made the free choice, because we were [he was] fair and smart, to discard all these riches; then we [he] left [i.e., went (back?) to the forest] and since then, we have become what we are now [or were until recently], a nomadic people."

The legend manipulates historical tradition. ? Sawing manipulates both historical tradition and the legend's statements.</page><page sequence="17">34 Bernard Sellato Then we should have a closer look at Sawing's personal comments. Although fairly ambiguous and couched in simplistic terms, they show some insight into the historical process which, as it is described, occurs in three stages: (1) A new culture arrives [from elsewhere] and takes over the old one [allegedly the traditional Bukat culture]; (2) the ancestors of the Bukat adopt the new culture, with Halangi's approval [whereas the legend implies that Halangi went away]; and (3) they discard all the implements of the old culture. We shall see later what we should think of the old culture and the new culture. The author, in his introductory remarks about "old regions", betrays genuine surprise at the fact that the upper Kapuas region ("a backward area") might bear traces of an ancient sophisticated culture. This could only confirm my suggestions that the Bukat only recently became aware of the existence of the artifacts (perhaps when they settled in Nanga Balang ca. 1960) and that the legend is a relatively new creation. The ambiguity concerning Halangi's whereabouts after the kensurai-nowev episode might also be seen as a confirmation of the speculation above that some of Liju's Bukat subsequently remained with the Kayan on the Mendalam, while others went from the Mendalam back to the forest. In this case, it would make sense that the Bukat at tributed the recently-discovered Nanga Balang artifacts to the earliest episode when they lived at Nanga Balang, as their oral tradition remembers it. 4.2 What Should We Do with Our Cultural Heritage? In the legend, Halangi (standing for unknown forebears) discards all the material items of the old culture. We are not told about the spiritual aspects of this culture and we might assume that they, too, are discarded. However, for Sawing, this is not the end of the story, since (1) Halangi (the ancestors) bequeathes the legend to his (their) descendants; (2) he buries the objects so that they are not damaged by the adherents to the new culture, and his descendants can later find them, for either utilization or study; and (3) he believes these things might be needed again in the future. Sawing reinterprets the discarding as being really a careful burying of the objects for preservation. His rationale is as follows: If the artifacts are now found buried in the ground, it is because someone buried them on purpose. This could only be Halangi, who must have believed that these objects might be needed again by his descendants. It follows that the old culture must have had a certain value. If so, arti facts associated with this culture must be viewed, in turn and retrospectively, as worthy of being preserved in the ground for future generations to find them. Sawing, however, admits that the artifacts are often found broken. His rationale contradicts the legend, which describes Halangi's total rejection of, and even hate for, these objects. In the legend, the manipulation of the tradition is clearly an attempt at appropri ating the culture that produced these artifacts in order to justify, a contrario, the deci sion to reject it and to live a nomadic life. The further stage of manipulation by Sawing appears to aim at asserting the Bukat's present moral and cultural rights over the artifacts and the culture that produced them, for the sake of the Bukat's past grandeur and, perhaps, their future (see section 5, below). Halangi rejected them but, after all, they used to belong to the Bukat. We should note that Sawing does not claim ownership rights to the artifacts for the Bukat: "Please come and dig", he writes. He would be happy enough, it seems, with the ensuing prestige for the Bukat. His emphasis is on the cultural values that the</page><page sequence="18">Cultural Identity Among Hunter-Gatherers in Borneo 35 artifacts represent, not their material value. Though this might be seen to constitute an echo to the national policy of promoting traditional (moral, social, and cultural) values (nilai-nilai tradisional), I believe that Sawing is genuinely concerned, for reasons of identity, with reaching a better comprehension of his group's past history. 4.3 The Christian Point of View: An a posteriori Legitimation Certain ambiguous notions of a cultural heritage appear here. Even if Sawing does not really believe in his own story, after appropriating this heritage through the legend itself and through his own interpretation, he finds himself wavering: If Halangi meant his descendants to find these artifacts, the question arises of what the current-day Bukat could, and indeed should, do with them. Utilize them (but how?), or study them (or rather, find some specialist to do so), but in any case promote them abroad. Here it is no longer a question of moral right, but one of moral duty. The author clearly asks: "We have an ancient cultural legacy, but what is its message to us? What did Halangi expect us to do with it?" Finally, after studying the problem from the Bukat point of view and coming up short of answers, Sawing turns to the Christian point of view. After the first mission opened in the 1910s, the whole upper Kapuas region converted to Catholicism and, for most Dayak, Christianity has become an important factor of identity in the context of the Moslems' dominant regional role. Sawing, again, starts from the idea that Halangi did bury, not discard, these artifacts. Then the message that Halangi meant to tell the Bukat, as Sawing reconstitutes it, is: (1) What is created by God is more perfect than what is made by Man; (2) live simply, do not be attached to worldly riches, get rid of the superfluity; (3) submit to God's decisions with a noble heart. Sawing's reconstituted pieces of advice by Halangi to his descendants form another set of cultural-political statements, strictly parallel to those we have found in the legend above (see Table 1). One suggests, by stressing the superiority of God-made things over Man-made things, and therefore that of Nature over Culture, that: "We Bukat were right, from a Christian point of view, to make the decision to abandon all worldly, artificial riches for the riches of Nature." At the same time, this legitimizes again the nomadic way of life, which is shown as supported by the Christian teachings. Sawing stops short of stating that it was the Christian ideology that led the Bukat to become nomadic. The second statement is of a political-religious nature and addresses the neighbour ing ethnic groups: "As we [Halangi and our forebears] came to the conclusion that God-made things [the kensurai flower] are superior to Man-made things [clothes, jewellery], and as we live simply and have gotten rid of the superfluity, thus we are better Christians than you who have remained attached to worldly riches." This a posteriori use of Christian teachings to upgrade the status of the usually-despised nomadic way of life is interesting, the more so because the Bukat are in the process of settling down and abandoning this way of life, as we shall see below. 4.4 The Curse and the Blessing We have in this legend and its interpretation a dual rationale for the Bukat's nomadic way of life: It is the result of both a curse and a blessing. The legend itself, whereby Halangi, defeated by a superior power, dispossesses himself of everything</page><page sequence="19">36 Bernard Sellato (and supposedly goes to live in the jungle), is reminiscent of other nomads' stories ex plaining the origin of their nomadic way of life by a defeat, a curse, or a mistake. Shortcomings in the cultures of nomads (as opposed to farmers) or of interior peoples (as compared to coastal peoples), as supposed or acknowledged by the participants in these cultures, are often explained in the same way. The Moken sea nomads of south western Thailand state that they were cursed by a Malay princess to live wandering on the seas.35 Similarly, a widespread Bornean legend tells how the Dayak in ancient times, like all humans, had a Book and were able to read. While crossing a river or during the Great Flood, they kept their books in their loincloths, the books got wet and blurred, and this is why the Dayak have no writing. The Malays kept their books dry in their hats, and so they can still read and write. I have shown elsewhere36 how, in the context of Borneo, historical events bearing a negative impact on a given community's collective self-esteem are distorted by the community's oraLtradition, how defeats are changed into victories, or retreats into free decisions. Even when it can't get around an undeniable historical fact, the oral tradi tion still manages to come up with an honourable explanation: When the chief is killed by enemies, for instance, the story tells of either his suicide or his free decision to let himself be killed. In the same way I believe that, in this Bukat legend, Halangi's defeat by the kensurai flower should be regarded as a curse, which has become an explanation (intended both for the neighbouring farmers and for the Bukat's collective self-esteem) for the Bukat's being (that is, according to the legend, becoming) nomads. Does this curse conceal a real historical event? Perhaps the Bukat were sent home by Liju when he had no more use of them, and they had to abandon all these things they had utilized or been familiar with while they were staying with Liju's armies. I believe that, one way or another, they had to abandon these objects. They were "banned" from that culture, and the banishment was turned, in the oral tradition, into Halangi's "free and noble" decision. In a typical fashion, Sawing's interpretation, by making use of the Christian point of view, attempts to transform the curse into a blessing: The nomadic way of life is the right way shown by the Christian teachings, it conforms to God's will and, by living "in a state of nature", the nomads are God's blessed children. Their feeling of cultural inferiority vis-?-vis their neighbours is reevaluated into a feeling of religious superiority, and the nomadic ideology finds here an unexpected modern religious prop. 4.5 Of Trees and Cultures: A System of Representations? Although I am not certain that symbolic representation systems have a relevance to the process under study here, I want to devote a few lines to the tree symbolism in the kensurai story (see 2.3) and in Sawing's comments (the last paragraph of 2.3, 35See J. Ivanoff, "L'?pop?e de Gaman: Histoire et cons?quences des relations Moken/Malais et Moken/Birmans", ASEMI 16, 1-4 (1985): 173-94. 36B. Sellato, "M?moire collective et nomadisme", Archipel 27 (1984): 85-108; this paper is forthcoming in English translation: "Collective Memory and Nomadism: Ethno-historical Investigations in Borneo", in Selected Articles from Archipel (provisional title) (Ithaca: Cornell University, Southeast Asia Program, Translation Series).</page><page sequence="20">Cultural Identity Among Hunter-Gatherers in Borneo 37 which Sawing might appropriately have placed in section 2.4 since it concerns his own views rather than the actual legend). In both the legend and Sawing's comments, it seems that the biyu tree stands for the old culture, that is, the ancient Bukat culture of Nanga Balang. We might take the kensurai tree of the legend to represent the nomadic culture and way of life. We shall see below (4.6) that Sawing does not state clearly his opinion on what replaced the old culture. However, Sawing stresses continuity, or rather revival: The biyu tree under which Halangi was sitting has died but a new biyu tree has stemmed from the old stump. The old culture has died, but the buried objects have been bequeathed by Halangi to his descendants, they have been found again and might be utilized again in the future. Some old man, in the future, will again hang his rattan swing seat from the branches of the new biyu tree, when it becomes strong enough. But there is a shadow in Sawing's picture: A powerful sengkuang tree has also grown there and threatens to suffocate the young biyu tree. Does this mean that the modern world culture, symbolized by the sengkuang, is expected to overtake the old culture, as if the latter were on the verge of being revived, only to be doomed to die again by suffocation? What can we learn from the choice of these tree species?37 All three, as could be expected (a Bukat would not make a mistake in identifying a tree), grow by rivers (see Table 2). The biyu grows on hillsides near rivers, especially in the secondary forest of fallowed swiddens, which would make it quite symbolic of a farming culture. The kensurai, growing on shale rocks on river banks, might symbolize the upriver region, where rocks crop out on steep river banks. Conversely the sengkuang, growing on alluvium, would be an appropriate symbol of the flatter downstream regions. Indeed, the geologist Molengraaff mentions that no rock in situ appears on the Kapuas during the first day's journey beyond Putussibau, whereas Balang Island is made of outcrop ping tuffs.38 The symbolism of this set of trees and their habitat fits remarkably well with the identification of the three cultures. Is it only by sheer chance? Or did Sawing choose deliberately these three trees to express something? Do these trees have a TABLE 2 TREES AND CULTURES Tree Species Known Ecology Environmental Referent Cultural Referent biyu kensurai sengkuang grows in secondary forest, after cultivation. grows on rocky river bank, upland areas. grows on alluvium in flat low-lying areas. swidden agricultural environment. upstream primary forest environment. downstream low plains environment. swidden rice-farming; village habitat; rich material culture. forest hunter-gatherers; nomadic way of life. riverine trade networks; Moslem sultanate; outside influences; modern world. 37Botanical Notes: kensurai is probably Dipterocarpus oblongifolius Bl.

This must remain open to conjecture for the moment. Let us now return to these cultures. We shall refer to them using those poetic tree names. In my interpretation, the ancient Nanga Balang culture (the 6/&gt;w-culture) should be that of Hindu-influenced Pin or Ot Danum and date back to, say, the second half of the eighteenth century. The legend's kensurai-culture, apparently, refers to the traditional nomadic Bukat culture, both before and after the Kayan episode (ca. 1830). As for Sawing's sengkuang-culture, we shall admit that it refers to the modern world culture. Sawing disregards the kensurai-cultme and considers in its place a "new culture", allegedly adopted by the Bukat after they abandoned the biyu culture. Let us call it simply the new-culture. This one might really refer to the Kayan culture of Liju's times. 4.6 Plural Identity and Ideological Contradiction What should we think of the way these cultures are dealt with in the Bukat legend and in Sawing's interpretation? The legend mentions only what we called the biyu culture and suggests that Halangi rejected it for a nomadic way of life, what we have called the kensurai-culture. The Z?/yw-culture is sophisticated and rich but, though it may be regarded as a cultural golden age, it is not the way of life the Bukat want; the kensurai-cultuTQ is pure, simple, and more appropriate. The legend opts for the latter, with Halangi possibly deciding to become a nomadic forest dweller (or to make a retour aux sources by returning to the nomadic way of life of an earlier stage of Bukat history?). Sawing does not acknowledge Halangi's clear rejection of the biyu-culture nor his likely departure (see Table 3). Diverging from the legend, he assumes that Halangi en dorses the replacement of the biyu-culture by a culture introduced by newcomers, the new-culture. He suggests that, instead of being discarded forever, the ?/yw-culture ? the Bukat's heritage ? is like a sleeping beauty that could be revived. In Sawing's mind, as in the legend, the rich and sophisticated ??(yw-culture is beyond any doubt TABLE 3 THE TREE-CULTURES IN THE LEGEND AND SAWING'S COMMENTS Stage 1: Bukat Legend Tree-Cultures 1 2: Sawing's Comments Tree-Cultures 2 rich clothes and jewellery; Halangi is a farmer? rich artifacts are discarded; Halangi becomes a forest hunter-gatherer? the 6/&gt;w-culture: swidden rice agriculturalists? victory of kensurai; the kensurai-culturc: "natural", nomadic way of life.

However, as stated above, Sawing's evaluation of the ?7/&gt;w-culture is ambiguous: This golden culture is too luxurious to allow for a healthy Christian way of life. But, at the same time, it is highly valued, nostagically regretted, and tentatively revived. Sawing's attitude towards the new-culture is equally ambiguous: From some of his comments (first paragraph of 2.4), we understand that the new-culture is not to be equated to the nomadic culture; it is clearly imposed by outsiders. Sawing seems to attribute to Halangi mixed feelings about the new-culture: On the one hand, Halangi [whether or not he adopts the new-culture himself] means his descendants to adhere to it; on the other hand, Halangi appears suspicious of the new-culture and carefully preserves the artifacts of the Wy?-culture for a possible future need. These misgivings appear somewhat odd to us, since Sawing states that the new-culture might be the Islamic or Christian culture. However, from the Christian point of view (second para graph of 2.4), Sawing seems to rather endorse the legend's statements and equate the new-culture with the nomadic culture (our kensurai-cultur?), as it is a simpler one, more in conformance with God's teachings. As for the sengkuang-culture, Sawing seems to perceive it as a threat, to the ??/&gt;w-culture at least. The sleeping beauty might be doomed for good because of the modern sengkuang-culture. 5. FROM HUNTING TO FARMING: RE-ADJUSTING THE TRADITION To summarize, I would suggest that the legend, elaborated by the Bukat at a time when their nomadic ideology was still unchallenged (perhaps only a couple of decades ago), stresses the legitimation of the nomadic way of life and strives to strengthen the nomads' status. The legend claims the ??/&gt;w-culture to be the real ancient Bukat culture only in order to state that the Bukat deliberately chose to become nomads. Sawing's comments appear somewhat inconsistent and contradictory. This, I sug gest, is due to the multi-facetted aspect of this modern, open character. As an educated man, he simply acknowledges the superseding of an old "Buddhist-like" culture (our ?/yw-culture) by another, imported culture (our new-culture), on which he does not elaborate much; he also sees in the same light the future advent of the modern culture (our sengkuang-cultur?). As a traditional Bukat, Sawing attempts ? like the legend ? to legitimize the nomadic way of life. As a Christian Bukat, he goes further in the same direction by making use of the Christian teachings, to stress that the nomadic Bukat are better Christians than the farmers. We find in Sawing's comments ? though not in the legend ? an all-pervasive reference to the rich old culture, which appears highly valued (somehow a contrario) and vividly regretted. It seems to me that Sawing has elaborated a sort of nostalgie des origines about this biyw-culture, after the Bukat discovered the artifacts and came up with this legend about them. It is not clear to what extent the rest of the Bukat share into this construction. The whole elaboration on Halangi burying the artifacts, bequeathing them to his descendants, and entrusting the latter with some moral duty in relation to these artifacts has, in my opinion, something to do with the current social-economic situation of the modern Bukat. In any case, it is clear to us that these origins are not the Bukat's. Besides, the nostalgia is in total contradiction with both the legend's cultural-political statements (see 4.1) and Sawing's political-religious statements (see 4.3), all aiming at legitimizing</page><page sequence="23">40 Bernard Sellato the nomadic way of life and upgrading its status. The point is, as we have said above, that the Bukat are now progressively abandoning their nomadic way of life, switching to a more permanent settlement pattern and to an economic system relying partly on agriculture. The 6/yw-culture, that golden age, might therefore be perceived by the modern Bukat as both a lost paradise and a dream for the future. The legend claims that the ?/&gt;w-culture is the ancient Bukat culture only to strengthen the nomads' iden tity; Sawing does the same, but for a different purpose: Whether directly (see 2.4) or metaphorically (see 2.3) he suggests that, out of pride in their own past or of desire to return to their roots, the Bukat might try to revive their old culture. The historical or mythical material on which, in a not-so-remote past, the still traditional-minded Bukat had drawn in order to strengthen their ideology and collec tive identity in face of contemptuous settled farmers is now becoming irrelevant in the modern Bukat's living conditions. Even from the religious point of view, the Bukat can no longer claim to be better Christians than the farmers, since they themselves have become consumers, too. Sawing's comments on the legend he recounts reflect a re adjustment, in the process, of the Bukat's ethnic historical tradition to new social economic circumstances. The very same historical and mythical material is being reworked and its meaning reinterpreted to better suit the current, slowly changing ideology and way of life. The fact that this reinterpretation has been committed to paper by a respected Bukat intellectual confers it more weight in Bukat circles, as it is common Bukat belief that anything written must be more trustworthy than some thing oral. Postscript: The present paper might, I hope, also serve as a reminder to scholars tempted to take local oral (or written) testimonies or literature at face value ? par ticularly when these accounts seem congruent with trendy theories ? without going through the pains of a thorough investigation into ethnography and history and into possible manipulations of historical accounts for ideological reasons. It would be all too easy to make uncritical use of such "evidence" as this Bukat legend to bring grist to the mill of the current spate of "revisionist" hunter-gatherer studies, some of which conclude too hastily that hunter-gatherers ? particularly tropical rainforest hunter gatherers ? have "devolved" from agricultural societies. The analysis in this paper, along with those in earlier and forthcoming publications,39 presents counter-evidence, sug gesting that some of these "revisionist" studies may be overdrawn. 39Sellato, "Les nomades forestiers", Nomades et s?dentarisation, and "Punan Question", and B.

Pendahuluan Yang namanya benda tua; kadang-kadang bernilai tinggi walaupun ujutnya tidak menarik. Disamping itu, benda-benda ini kadang-kadang mempunyai nilai ilmiah yang tinggi pula. Oleh karena itu, penemuan benda-benda tua adalah suatu penemuan yang cukup menarik. Benda-benda tua tersebut biasanya ditemukan didaerah yang tua juga. Tetapi mengapa di Kapuas Hulu dan justru diperhuluan S. Kapuas (daerah yang masih tergolong terbelakang) malah bisa ditemukan benda-benda tua? Tertarik oleh keadaaan tersebutlah maka penulis mencoba menuangkan legenda yang ada "TENTANG TERDAPATNYA/TERJADINYA BENDA-BENDA TUA DI KAMPUNG NANGA BALANG". 2. ASAL MULA ?ama kampung NANGA BALANG Pada jaman dahulu kala, terdapatlah suatu perkampungan suku BUKAT diper huluan S. Kapuas. Letak kampung tersebut strategis sekali, karena dikampung ter sebutlah tempat yang paling cocok untuk istirahat bagi orang-orang yang mengadakan perjalanan dari dan keperhuluan S. Kapuas. Hal tersebut disebabkan karena daerah bahaya apabila kita akan mudik kerpehuluan S. Kapuas, dimulai dari sebelah hulu kampung tersebut. Jadi kampung tersebut tepat sekali guna tempat istirahat bagi orang yang akan mengadakan perjalanan mudik guna mengontrol semua perlengkapan tentang kesiapannya. Sebaliknya bagi yang milir, kampung tersebut tepat sekali untuk istirahat guna mengucap rasa syukur dan mengendorkan urat syaraf akibat perjalanan yang men gerikan. Tidak jauh dari perkampungan tersebut, terdapatlah sebuafh] bukit. Puncak bukit tersebut menjulang tinggi seperti botol (dalam bahasa Bukat balang). Oleh karenanya bukit tersebut lantas dinamakan BUKIT BALANG. Dilereng bukit Balang, mengalirlah sebuah sungai yang bermuara di S. Kapuas. Karena sungai tersebut mengalir/bermata air dari bukit Balang, maka sungai tersebut lantas dinamakan SUNGAI BALANG. Diseberang muara S. Balang, terdapat sebuah pulau ditengah sungai Kapuas. Pulau tersebut dinamakan PULAU BALANG. Dihilir muara S. Balang, terdapatlah perkampungan suku BUKAT tersebut. Oleh karena itulah maka perkampungan tersebut lantas dinamakan kampung NANGA BALANG. 3. Kisah kemenangan pohon kensurai Pada suatu waktu, pemuka kampung Ng Balang bernama HALANGI. Pak Halangi tersebutlah yang diakui sebagai nenek moyang suku Bukat Kapuas.</page><page sequence="25">42 Bernard Sellato Sebagai seorang pemuka, Pak Halangi sering beristirahat ditepi S. Kapuas agar bisa melihat orang-orang yang sedang milir mudik didepan kampung Ng Balang. Untuk istirahat sesantai mungkin, Pak Halangi ngantun[g] ayunan (membuat ayunan dari rotan) dipohon biyu yang tumbuh diseberang kepala Pulau Balang. Pada suatu hari, ketika Pak Halangi sedang berayun sambil istiharat, mata Pak Halangi melihat bunga yang berwarna merah melambai-lambai dengan indahnya diseberang S. Kapuas. Pak Halangi berkata: "Alangkahnya indahnya bunga tersebut. Bunga apakah gerangan? Tetapi apabila saya berpakaian yang indah-indah, tidafk] kalah indahnya dengan bunga tersebut. " Ternyata bunga yang dimaksudkan adalah bunga pohon kensurai. Setelah berkata demikian, Pak Halangi lantas turun dari ayunan, lantas pulang untuk mengambil pakaian yang indah-indah. Maka dipakainyalah semua pakaian indah yang dimilikinya. Setelah berpakaian lengkap, Pak Halangi lantas pergi lagi ke ayunan. Pak Halangi berkata: "Mari kita bertingkis (bersaing/bertanding), mana yang lebih indah, warna bungamu atau pakaian saya". Lama Pak Halangi bergantian memandang pakaiannya dan bunga kensurai tersebut. Setelah lama bergantian memperhatikan, timbullah didalam pikirannya, bahawa pakaian Pak Halangi kalah indah dengan warna bunga kensurai tersebut. Secara jantan Pak Halangi mengakui bahwa kalah bertingkis dengan bunga pohon kensurai. Akibat kekalahannya tersebut, timbullah kejengkelan dihati Pak Halangi. Maka dibuangnyalah semua perhiasan, pakaian serta semua alat keperluan sehari-hari yang dimilikinya. Setelah itu, entah kemana perginya Pak Halangi, tidak diceritakan. Barang-barang tua yang sering ditemukan diperkampungan Ng. Balang tersebut, menurut kisah adalah barang-barang milik Pak Halangi yang dibuang akibat kalah bertingkis dengan pohon kensurai tersebut. Sampai sekarang, kita masih bisa menemukan sisa-sisa barang tua diperkampungan Ng. Balang apabila kita mahu menggali tanah disana, walaupun ditemukan dalam keadaaan rusak. Dan sampai sekarang, pohon kensurai banyak tumbuh dipantai sungai diperhuluan S. Kapuas. Dipantai S. Kapuas sebelah hilir memang kurang begitu banyak. Barang-barang yang pernah ditemukan tersebut diantaranya adalah: ? Batu yang berbentuk seperti kemaluan laki-laki. ? Kalung manik-manik ? Gelang, cincin dari emas. ? Gumpalan emas. ? Kampak batu. ? Pecahan-pecahan tempayan tua. Sampai sekarang, apabila kita mahu menggali tanah dengan kedalaman 1/2 s/d 1 meter saja, pasti sudah bisa menemukan barang tua, minimal pecahan kaca. Dan tempatnyapun tidak perlu terlalu jauh, cukup menggali tanah yang dijalan di depan rumah saja. Pohon biyu yang dimaksud, pohon yang asli sudah mati, tetapi sekarang yang ada adalah pohon biyu yang tumbuh dari pokoknya. Tetapi disitu lantas tumbuh lagi pohon sengkuang yang sangat subur sehingga mengalahkan pohon biyu yang ada. Kalau kita perhatikan peristiwa tersebut mestinya baru berumur seumur pohon-pohon biyu dan sengkuang ditambah beberapa tahun saja.</page><page sequence="26">Cultural Identity Among Hunter-Gatherers in Borneo 43 4. Komentar penulis Dari cerita tersebut, diperkirakan pada jaman dahulu pernah berkembang suatu kebudayaan yang mirip kebudayaan Budha dikampung Ng. Balang. Tetapi pada suatu saat, masuklah kebudayaan baru (barangkali masuknya agama Islam atau Kristen) yang dapat mendesak pengaruh kebudayaan lama tersebut. Dengan masuknya kebudayaan baru tersebut, nenek moyang suku Bukat meninggalkan cerita agar menjadi pelajaran bagi anak-cucunya. a. Barang-barang peninggalan kebudayaan lama dikubur agar: 1. Tidak dirusak oleh penganut kebudayaan baru yang baru masuk. 2. Agar kelak kemudian hari anak-cucunya bisa menemukan lagi entah untuk digunakan atau untuk dipelajari. b. Merupakan suatu nasehat. 1. Apapun buatan Tuhan (Yang Berkuasa), akan lebih sempurna dari pada buatan manusia. (Keadaan ini dilukiskan dalam cerita bahwa bunga kensurai adalah buatan Tuhan sedangkan pakaian adalah buatan manusia. Keindahan susunan pakaian tidak sesempurna keindahan bunga kensurai) 2. Janganlah silau terhadap kekayaan orang lain atau boleh dikatakan hiduplah sederhana. (Ini dilukiskan bahwa silaunya terhadap keindahan bunga kensurai, akhirnya malah menghancurkan semua apa yang dimiliki) 3. Berwataklah yang satria. Jika Tuhan menghendaki memang kita kalah, akuilah kekalahan kita secara satria, jangan berbuat licik dengan membalas secara gelap. Keadaan ini dilukiskan dengan kekalahan Pak Halangi bertingkis dengan bunga pohon kensurai. Pak Halangi mengakui kekalahannya secara jujur. Setelah merasa kalah, secara satria, dibuangnyalah semua apa yang dimiliki tetapi pohon kensurai tidak diapa-apakan. Disamping itu juga merupakan suatu nasehat bahwa Pak Halangi mengijinkan anak-cucunya untuk menganut kebudayaan baru, tetapi dengan harapan bahwa kebudayaan lama yang per nah dianut jangan dirusak sama sekali, sebab pada suatu saat mungkin diperlukan. Hal ini dilukiskan bahwa barang-barang yang dipakai Pak Halangi tidak dirusak tetapi dibuang begitu saja. Dari dibuang begitu saja, dimungkinkan bahwa barang-barang tersebut masih bisa ditemukan oleh orang lain dan mungkin masih bisa digunakan. c. Dalam perkembangan yang akan datang, bukan tidak mustahil bahwa kebudayaan lama tersebut mengundang tenaga ahli untuk menyelidikinya. Namun demikian, kemungkinan tersebut hanya mungkin terlaksana apabila infor masi ini bisa diterima. Untuk dapatnya informasi adanya benda-benda tua dikampung Ng. Balang, perlu adanya langkah-langkah promosi dari kita semua. 5. Penutup Demikianlah sekelumit tentang kisah rakyat "SEBAB-SEBAB TERDAPATNYA BARANG-BARANG TUA DI KAMPUNG NANGA BALANG". Benar tidaknya terserah kepada para pembaca. Tetapi jikalau pembaca ingin mem buktikannya, silakan saja, hanya mohon hati-hati jika menggali tanah dikampung Ng. Balang. Sebab tidak mustahil akan menemukan barang tua yang mempunyai nilai sejarah kebudayaan. Mohon maaf atas segala kekurangan kami.</page></plain_text>
