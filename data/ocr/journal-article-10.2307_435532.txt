<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST' ARNOLD BERGSTRASSER G OETHE'S religion of humanity forms a part of Christian history, al- though it reinterprets or even de- nies some of the tenets of orthodox Chris- tian theology. Supporting the principle of religious freedom, Goethe considered the Reformation an important step toward such freedom. But he kept himself free from the dogma, including that of Prot- estantism.2 In so far as he believed in the critical and creative mission of human reason to work out philosophic insight and human conduct, his attitude was human- istic; but it is distinguished from a ration- alist or positivist approach by Goethe's understanding of reason (Vernunft), which is different from intellect (Verstand) and includes both poetical and religious experi- ence and evaluation.A His religious poetry and prose is in harmony with the motives and results of his research in nature. It is the testimony of a personal faith and yet is related to the tradition of spiritualism which, as a "third religion," pervades the development of occidental Christian thought. On the basis of these concepts, Goethe was consistent in his view of Christ throughout his life and work. Goethe held that, in contrast to communal activity, true religion remains something inward and even individual.4 Thus his image of Christ early took on a personal form, ac- cording to his own genuine experience.5 Goethe's judgment on Christianity and the Christian churches, however, varied from antagonism against hierarchy and dogma to praise of the "miraculous phe- nomenon of the Christian religion."' Goethe considered faith as the power and the task of inward experience rather than of outward obedience, and conduct or ac- tion rather than pious devotion its test. He maintained a sharp distinction be- tween Christ and Christianity. In defense of his growing convictions against Lava- ter's effort to convert him to his own view of Christianity, he once stated that he was a decided non-Christian.' But he also 1 Goethe's works are cited according to the Jubilaumsausgabe (JA), with the exception of Wil- helm Meisters theatralische Sendung and Ephemeriden, which are cited according to the Insel Ausgabe (Grossh.

It was, however, not a little favored by the tendency of the heart to return to a certain simple state of nature and by that of creative imagination to gain in concentration." a "Die Vernunft ist auf das Werdende, der Verstand auf das Gewordene angewiesen" (Maximen und Re- flexionen, XXI, 120, No. 555; cf. also p. 192, No. 922; letter to Riemer, September 26, 1807 [Biedermann, IV, 691).

The rela- tionship and antagonism between Goethe and Lavater are clearly characterized, for example, in Goethe's letters of April 26, 1774, and August 9, 1782.

It was in the aesthetic anal- ogy of Greek art that Goethe found the strongest support for his concept of the balance of human faculties, the classic ideal of harmony and totality.x0 And yet he built the educational institution de- scribed in Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre upon a doctrine of man and of history which corresponds to, and explicitly re- fers to, an image of Christ."1 Even among orthodox critics there is no doubt as to Goethe's awareness of and re- spect before the holy, the numinosum.12 But he is also interpreted as a pagan be- cause of the pantheistic elements in his philosophy. His concept of man is con- sidered as that of a self-sufficient being.13 His educational aim of civilizing man and society is seen as part of the cultural tra- ditionalism which, for instance, a radically supra-naturalist theology in the following of Kierkegaard judges fallacious. In Rein- hold Niebuhr's terms, also, Goethe and his work are a part of the survival of the "Renaissance" and therefore stand in necessary opposition to the challenge of the Reformation.14 The problem of Goethe's religion raises the question of the relation between religion and civilization in general. Because it includes a view of Christ, it involves both the kinship and the antagonism between literary human- ism and Christianity and constitutes a modern and actual question.

Korff in Der Geist der Goethezeit (Leipzig, 1923-30), Vol. I, Book I, chap. ii, and Vol. II, Book I, chap. i, gives a thorough analysis of Goethe's religion of humanity within the larger frame of German philo- sophical idealism, which he distinguishes as "idealism of reason" from Goethe's and Herder's "idealism of nature." A controversy about the subject, in which dialectic theologians, orthodox Lutherans, and philosophers took part, produced an extensive literature, in which the work of W. Luetgert, Die Religion des deutschen Idealismus und ihr Ende (2d ed.; Gtitersloh, 1923- 30), was the leading representative of the older ortho- dox viewpoint. Eduard Spranger's remarkable criti- cism of the orthodox and the existentialist negation of Goethe as well as of philosophical idealism is in Der Kampf gegen den deutschen Idealismus (Sitzungsber. d.

This essay refers, in connection with specific problems, to other pertinent contributions. Christoph Schrempf's articles on Goethe's relation to Christianity in Goethe-Handbuch, ed. Julius Zeitler (Stuttgart, 1916-18), are built on misleading doctrin- ary prejudices. The claim (I, 318) that "Goethe never took Christianity seriously enough to think about its nature" speaks for itself.</page><page sequence="3">174 ARNOLD BERGSTRXSSER thought and to discuss the symbolist mode of his thinking, before we try to adum- brate the contours of his view of Christ and its position within Goethe's philoso- phy, which conceives spirit and nature as divine manifestations. Restricted to this purpose, this literary analysis may also, it is hoped, contribute to the religious prob- lem which its subject involves. I. THE RETURNING CHRIST Faust and Prometheus remained in Goethe's mind as central figures of his poetical production. The image of Christ stayed with him as a lasting figure of his religious concepts. It formed a part of the basic structure of his thought, the plan of which was early laid out. Our attention should not be deflected too far from the unity of its design by insight into the de- velopment of Goethe's style and his in- creasing consciousness of the poet's re- sponsible position in society. In the light of his basic concepts, the period of Goe- the's classicism, which comprises the age of his manhood between the Sturm und Drang poetry and the wisdom of his last decades, takes the aspect of growth and implementation rather than of rupture. If one applies Goethe's conception of Ge- stalt to his own development, the lasting and the changing determinants of his per- sonality can be distinguished.'5 Then, Goethe's view of Christ turns out to be close to the lasting foundations of his at- titude toward man and life. On the other hand, Goethe considers organized -religion a part of predominantly secular history. His judgment about it is more susceptible to considerations of pedagogy or to reac- tive impulses of the moment. Certainly, Goethe said that man, as a boy, is a realist; as an adolescent, an ideal- ist; as an adult, a skeptic; and in old age he becomes a mystic. Hinting thereby at tendencies prevailing on the various age- levels, he did not contradict his funda- mental conviction that there exists a core of the personality which lasts throughout the course of life. The development of Goethe's religious beliefs proceeded by an inner logic. The religious ideas of Goethe's classicism bear traits which are character- istic also of the young and the old Goethe. In Iphigenie auf Tauris guilt is expiated and a seemingly insuperable antagonism is reconciled by the interference of the di- vine through the mediation of the humane Iphigenie. The soul is freed from pain and despair by an act of grace through which the divine becomes immanent. Converse- ly, Faust and Epimetheus in Pandora make evident the transcendental relation- ship to higher spheres to which man is subject. Whether Goethe concentrated upon the search in nature or upon the classical image of man in art, he remained aware of life as a fragment and was con- cerned abouit the divine as a living force. Within the whole of his philosophy, im- manence and transcendence are rhythmi- cally co-ordinated rather than mutually exclusive."6 The old Goethe expressed his concern about the Christian religion when he said: "To me Christ always remains a highly significant but problematic being.""7 And he immediately continued: "Mankind finds itself now in a religious crisis." This crisis is related to the modern critical and 15 Franz, Goethe, p. 163. Heinz Kindermann, in his survey of literature on Goethe, "Mehr Goethe?" in D VfLuG, VIII (1930), 558 fT., overemphasizes the need of genetic interpretation in view of a "perma- nently changing personality such as Goethe was" (p. 582). 16 Cf. Oppel, p. 157. 17 To F. von Miiller, June 16, 1830 (Biedermann, IV, 283). The part of the conversation which concerns our problem started out with the discussion of the anonymous "Glaubensbekenntnisse eines Denkgliu- bigen Christen" (1830). Referring to it as a weak compromise between rationalism and religion, Goethe said: "It is necessary either to uphold the belief in the tradition without engaging in the criticism of it, or else, if one pursues the criticism, to abandon this be- lief, a third alternative not being thinkable."</page><page sequence="4">GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST 175 historical view of apostles and saints which makes "fellows such as Klopstock, Lessing, and ourselves" comparable to them. Goethe hints at the tension between orthodoxy and enlightenment which he had solved for himself by extending the domain of inspiration far beyond the Bible and the Christian witnesses. He had pursued the principle of religious freedom to the point of separating himself entirely from the clerical tradition.'8 On the other hand, he characterizes the significance of the personality of Christ by a statement made a few months later: "Each appear- ance of Christ, each of his utterances, tends to render evident the sublime."'9 Goethe's concept of Christ had a two- fold problematic aspect. Seen as the mani- festation of a higher sphere toward which to draw man is His mission, Christ is re- lated to the central tenet of Christology, the incarnation of God in human flesh. The doctrine of incarnation was, as we shall see, compatible with Goethe's con- cept of the spirit. But this same connec- tion of Christ with the sublime also causes His tension with the temporal nature and conduct of man. The doctrine of the church considers Him the unique media- tor between man and God, and His cruci- fixion the proof of man's sinful insuffi- ciency. Goethe, while recognizing this tension, could not, on account of his con- cept of the spirit, accept Christ's position as the unique mediator or the nature of man as unilaterally sinful. Goethe invokes this problematic per- sonality of Christ in his fragment "Des ewigen Juden erster Fetzen"20 in order to demonstrate the antagonism between Him and the institutions bearing His name. He presents Christ as returning to earth where He comes into contact with the churches and with pastors. The fragment itself, its description in Dichtung und Wahrheit, and the notes of the Italienische Reise about it make it probable that Goe- the intended to end this ironical view of historical Christianity by a second cruci- fixion of the founder.21 When, on his jour- ney, he was approaching the center of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, this "venio iterum crucifigi" came to his mind again.22 The fragment was intended to connect its indictment equally with the misunder- standing of Christ and the abuse of power in which Goethe saw the Protestant churches involved. Not merely tolerant but, in his own way, believing, Goethe kept separated from the doctrines and practices of churches and sects the pure gospel and the pure image of Christ. If in later years the critical side of this distinc- tion sometimes softened, it was so because Goethe gave preference to every fruitful effort over mere critical antagonism. Moreover, he felt the need to protect his deep religious seriousness against pedan- try and conceit by the mask of his "os- tensible liberalistic indifferentism."''23 The affirmative meaning of Goethe's image of the pure Christ, however, is equally strong from his earliest poem on "Christi H6llenfahrt" to his last conversa- tion with Eckermann.24 Before his con- 18 Karl Lowith (Von Hegel bis Nietzsche [Ztirich, 19411, p. 42) quotes our passage with reference to the crisis in the history of Christianity but interprets Goethe's view of it in terms of post-Goethean pessi- mism because he relates it to Goethe's expectation of an impending social crisis. Thereby, he overemphasizes the social determinants of Goethe's thought. 19 Letter to Zelter, November 9, 1830. 20 "Des ewigen Juden erster Fetzen" (JA, III, 232-41).

Com- paring himself to Peter, he contrasts his and Peter's weakness in faith with Christ's power to walk on the sea.28 Goethe's par- ticipation in the pietist community and his close relationship to Susanna von Klettenberg, the Cordata of Wilhelm Meister and Dichtung und Wahrheit, sup- ported him in moving away from the more orthodox leanings of his father, even be- fore Herder encouraged his widening un- derstanding of divinity. His relations to Lavater and Jacobi, the Stolbergs, and Jung-Stilling meant as many stages in the articulation of his individual religious consciousness. His reading of Giordano Bruno and Plotinus, of Gottfried Arnold's Unabhdngige Kirchen- und Ketzergeschichte and of Mme Guyon's Torrents spiri- tuels29 indicates his interest in the thoughts of spiritualism, whereas the works of Theophrastus Paracelsus and Charles Bonnet's Palingendsie30 supported the union of his feeling for nature and his in- tellectual concern about it with his reli- gious impulse. Thus the way to liberating the irration- alist concept of the world from Christian dogmatism-the step which Herder took beyond Hamann31-was prepared for Goethe by his acquaintance with spiritual- ism. On account of the impact which the spiritualist tradition made upon Goethe, his relationship to Spinoza was character- ized, with good reason, as a reinterpreta- tion of the latter's philosophy in the man- ner of mysticism.32 The differentiation be- tween the religion of Christ and the Chris- tian religion33 is basic to Gottfried Ar- nold's concepts in general and to his criti- cism of the church in particular, which he charges with the persecution as heretics of "the dearest witnesses and messengers of Jesus Christ."34 In Goethe's evangelical community of "those good and wise to the highest degree," we recognize another ver- sion of the invisible church, more secular 26 Cf.

Thereby Spinoza's concept of cognitio adaequata is contradicted.

In contrast to Lessing, Gottfried Arnold identified Christ with Sophia or Eternal Wisdom. Likewise, to Arnold man is closer to Christ as God-Man, because man potential- ly shares in divine wisdom also. 34 Gottfried Arnold ("Auswahl hg. von Erich Seeberg" [Munich, 19341), p. 37.</page><page sequence="6">GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST 177 but no less religious than the ecclesia spiritualis.35 From it Goethe retained the belief in the dynamic aliveness of the di- vinity whose ultimate basis is rationally not conceivable because it is beyond all reasoning. The principal concern of the defenders of religious awakening among Goethe's friends was not limited by confessional boundaries.36 With them Goethe shared the confidence in inward inspiration and personal religious growth and the tend- ency toward an immediate understanding of the pure gospel and the pure Christ without the mediation of dogma, clergy, or ministry. Correspondingly, the young Goethe was averse not only to the supra- naturalist theology but also to the philo- sophical rationalism which tends to sub- stitute a product of the intellect for the unacceptable supra-natural revelation. Both types of doctrine established from without the divinity which, Goethe felt, spoke to him from within and through na- ture.37 Yet an extraordinary realism38 of observation caused him to be on guard against the "noblest delusions and the most tender confusions of the subjective and the objective"39 in religious feeling as much as against a misleading self-reliance of the intellect. Withdrawing in the years of inner crisis and growth into his increasingly reliable creative energies,40 he experienced in him- self the power of genius granted to the "particularly favored" among men. It was then that he conceived, by analogy to his own poetical experience, the figures of men of genius who, on the border line be- tween the divine and the human, are to mediate between mankind and the uni- verse. They are like members of one fam- ily, although Prometheus and Caesar lay the emphasis on the titanic energy of man, Faust on his insatiable searching mind, Mahomet and Christ upon their original unity with the divine origin.41 All have a "redeeming, dominating, transforming mission."42 All have to bear the solitude which never entirely dissolves in their re- lation to others because it is an indispens- able function of their quality. With all these individuals, their author tried to formulate not only the problem of genius but that of the situation of man and his kind. They are heading toward a tragic 35 Ernst Troeltsch, Die Soziallehren der christlichen Kirchen und Gruppen (Tiibingen, 1912), Part III, sec. 4, pp. 848-940, gave a comprehensive analysis of Protestant mysticism and spiritualism. The term "spiritualism," as it is used in this essay, comprises those Christian tendencies within German Protestant- ism whose worship and philosophy are built upon man's sharing in the Holy Spirit rather than on the justification by faith, in the sense of the reformers. The spiritualists, consequently, presupposed and emphasized the immediate relation of man to God through the spirit; they supported a dogmatically free exegesis; they disposed of sacramental forms and tended toward "original Christianity" in their con- ception of the religious community. Both different from and akin to later movements, such as Zinzen- dorf's and Lavater's pietism, they continued the Neo-Platonic tradition of medieval mysticism. Para- celsus, Valentin Weigel, and Jacob Boehme are among their leading figures. They are related to Schwenck- feld and to the Rosicrucians. Gottfried Arnold found the positive basis for his historical criticism of the church and the persecution of heretics in the doctrine of the emanation of the divine Logos and the concept of the ecclesia spiritualis.

Mahomet, who, like Christ, knows himself the son of an all-loving father, is to meet tragedy because of his own in- evitable unfaithfulness toward his origin,43 Christ because of the failure of man to grasp and to heed the significance of His first appearance on earth. Goethe's pure Christ is in loving con- flict with the world. The ironical tone of the poem does not decrease Goethe's reverence for the returning Lord. It is, on the contrary, the basis of his attack upon any false certainty in which men in- dulge when they rely upon themselves while abusing Christ's name. Irony meant to Goethe a means of liberating one's self from the bonds of human insufficiency.44 As a power of doubt and negation, it de- pends upon the correlated existence of a power of affirmation. Mephistopheles is in need of Faust because only against Faust's affirmative energies can he "de- velop his dogmatic nihilism."45 This dia- lectic tension serves to clarify the order of values. Goethe's returning Christ is a liv- ing criticism of an inadequate Christian- ity.46 With Goethe's interpretation of Christ, Lavater, who himself considered Him the highest genius, could not agree.'4 He could not consent to a view of Christ as one among others who also bear witness to divine revelation, or to a recognition of the Bible as inspired but sharing this quality with other documents of revealed wis- dom.48 In the end this opinion even caused him to suspect Goethe's understanding of revelation as such. Finally, the considera- tion of nature as a divine manifestation antagonized Lavater as well as Jacobi, who, each in his fashion, remained within the bounds of introspection and other- worldliness.41 The step which Goethe took went far beyond spiritualism. It was possible, how- ever, exactly from such a basic experience which was neither rationalistic nor exclu- sively supra-naturalist. In the "child of the world," who later confessed to have also had, fortunately, a heavenly dimen- sion,"5 a religious philosophy of his own came to grow. Within it Christ could no longer be the unique mediator. The story of the Savior became a myth of the situa- tion and destiny of man and his relation to the Creator. As Goethe's understanding of the Bible, so his concept of Christ, be- came mythological. r4 Cf. Dichtung und Wahrheit, III, 14 (JA, XXIV, 222-23), about Mahomet: "Das Irdische wichst und breitet sich aus, das G6ttliche tritt zuriick und wird getriibt." 44 For an analysis of Goethe's irony see Franz, Goethe, pp. 98-108. 45 Georg Friedrich Jiinger, Uber das Komische (Hamburg, 1936), p. 70. 46 Goethe's plan anticipated Dostoievski's theme of the returning Christ visiting the Grand Inquisitor in The brothers Karamazov. With respect to the latter, Ernst Benz wrote on "Der wiederkehrende Christus" in Zeitschrift filr slavische Philologie, XI (1934), 277- 98. He contends that "the problem of the returning Christ and his rejection by the church bearing his name always and necessarily emerges in such his- torical periods in which a spiritualistic devotion and theology elevates itself against a clericalism, which, in its turn, has completely bound and captured the pneumatic element by juridical institutions, theo- logical systems, and liturgical rituals" (p. 277). He refers to the myth of St. Francis as "the second Christ," deals with the spiritualism of Sebastian Franck and Valentin Weigel, and refers to the spiritualist theory of decay, particularly in Gottfried Arnold. 47 About Lavater's conception of Christ as the "highest man" and the necessity of the mediator which arises because it "is blasphemy to dare pray to Him (i.e., to the universal spirit of the universe) without mediation," see Lavater to Goethe, July 28, 1782, pp. 206-7.

THE SYMBOL AS A MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING To evaluate the bearing of such mytho- logical thinking upon cognition and con- duct, some understanding is needed for the ways in which Goethe operated with symbols. When he calls the story of Jesus "das Miirchen von Christus,"51 he does not give to the term Mdrchen the connota- tion of "fiction." He was by no means doubtful of the historicity of Christ or of His irrevocable significance within the process of history.52 The mythical form, however, conveys truth in a distinctive fashion, in that it opens a view upon its subject instead of attempting an abstract analysis. "The myth is a symbol clad in the form of an event, substantive in verbal form."53 Keeping united content and form, literal foreground and transparent signifi- cance, the symbol creates a relationship between the mind and its object54 which is of a dynamic character. Dynamic is the relationship of the faithful to the object of his faith, of the poet to the object of his creative imagination. Thinking in terms of symbols is a part of that learning which Goethe regards as an inner growth of man's self. "Each new object releases a new faculty in man."55 With the accuracy of a mystic observer Goethe described the inner condition of Gelassenheit ("seren- ity") under which such growth can occur. It is the free and therefore impressionable state of the soul intent upon perceiving without disturbance the action of "inner and outer nature."56 This way of self-edu- cation through life puts to work both feel- ing and intellect."7 A human being unprej- udiced by one-sidedness and therefore free is able to master the totality of man's capacity, as if he were, in Schiller's sense, playing. He will be able to observe with love, to gain in understanding, and to live well. All knowledge, however, remains lim- ited, and to its higher part not many bear witness. Imitating the gods, "we are sure of what we are doing but we do not know what we imitate."58 This inevitable anthropomorphism, however, which is inherent in metaphysi- cal thought and religious worship, causes man's unlimited striving and cautious sdlf-control rather than agnosticism or the denial of metaphysics."5 Goethe is aware 61 To Herder, September 4, 1788. 52 The human mind "will never get beyond the sublimity and moral culture of Christianity, as it shines in the Gospels" (to Eckermann, March 11, 1832 [Biedermann, IV, 443]). 53 Brunner, p. 329, n. 1. 64 Koch, chap. iv ("Der schaffende Spiegel"), re- lates Goethe's concept of polarity to his understand- ing of the human mind as a creative mirror of the uni- verse and discusses the bearing of this concept upon Goethe's epistemology and upon the theory of art of Goethe himself and of Karl Philipp Moritz. Cf. also Ferdinand Weinhandl, Uber das aufschlicssende Sym- bol (Berlin, 1929), chap. viii. 55 "Der Mensch kennt nur sich selbst, insofern er die Welt erkennt, die er nur in sich und sich nur in ihr gewahr wird. Jeder neue Gegenstand, wohl beschaut, schliesst ein neues Organ in uns auf" ("Bedeutende F6rdernis durch ein einziges geistreiches Wort" [JA, XXXIX, 48]). 66 Dichtung und Wahrheit, III, 12 (JA, XXIV, 112- 13): "Ich suchte mich innerlich von allem Fremden zu entbinden, das Aussere liebevoll zu betrachten, und alle Wesen, vom menschlichen an, so tief hinab, als sie nur fasslich sein mochten, auf mich wirken zu lassen. Dadurch entstand eine wundersame Verwandt- schaft mit den einzelnen Gegenstinden der Natur, und ein inniges Anklingen, ein Mitstimmen ins Ganze." Cf. Eckhart's concept of "Gelassenheit," e.g., in Reden der Unterweisung (Leipzig, n.d.), p. 3. 57 "Aber der Mensch ist nicht bloss ein denkendes, er ist zugleich ein empfindendes Wesen. Er ist ein Ganzes, eine Einheit vielfacher, innig verbundener Krafte, und zu diesem Ganzen muss das Kunstwerk reden, es muss dieser reichen Einheit, dieser einigen Mannigfaltigkeit in ihm entsprechen" ("Der Sammler und die Seinigen," 6. Brief [JA, XXXIII, 175]). 58 From "Makariens Archiv" (JA, IV, 234); trans- lated from Hippocrates De victus ratione: "Denn die Gitter lehren uns ihr eigenstes Werk nachahmen; doch wissen wir nur was wir tun, erkennen aber nicht was wir nachahmen." 69 Calvin Thomas calls Goethe "an out-and-out pantheist who is at the same time an agnostic" (p. 227). As a result of the postulate of unity as basic to mysticism and Renaissance philosophy of nature, there seems to be a difficulty in distinguishing "be- tween God and non-God." With regard to Goethe, this difficulty exists for discursive thinking only (Verstand). Goethe was neither an out-and-out pantheist nor an agnostic. The term "pantheism" tends to eliminate the distinction between the divinity</page><page sequence="9">180 ARNOLD BERGSTRASSER of "the danger of asking too much from knowledge."60 A direct access to the abso- lute is impossible. Any attempt toward it is bound to be an anthropomorphism in itself. Goethe compared "his own inner working to a living heuristic.""61 The sym- bolical expression in matters metaphysical is affirmative and synthetic and, at the same time, sufficiently delicate and indi- rect.62 The restriction of human certainty on which Goethe insists corresponds to his respect for the secret of the unknowable. In both an ontological and a logological sense the Creator is higher than all reason. But myth to Goethe is no less valid be- cause it is symbolical. It is not a "mere" symbol. Goethe does not reduce the body of valid knowledge to analytical rational- ism.63 Beyond it, man's creative daring is strengthened by the inspiration of genius, through a fellowship of wisdom which ex- tends over three thousand years.64 There- fore, Goethe continues to recognize the temporal as a parable of the eternal and to strive toward formulating and repre- senting its meaning. Symbolical experi- ence and knowledge give a clue to truth, although at the same time they keep it concealed. The symbol, even though it is not the truth itself, reflects the truth. It is from truth that the poet receives the veil of poetry.65 The symbol, then, as a means of cogni- tion and expression transcends the rheto- rical as well as the aesthetic. Whether its motifs are of Greek origin, as in Pandora, or of Christian origin, as in Faust, Goe- the's symbolism tends toward the reli- gious. To his mind human culture is a cre- ative and dynamic solution by which man tries to solve the riddle of his existence. It is therefore transcendental both in origin and in significance. Goethe's lead- ing figures of genius are religious person- and the sphere of its creation, a distinction which Goethe upheld. On the other hand, the term "pan- entheism" tends to de-emphasize the difference be- tween creator and creation upon which supra-natural- ism insists as a basic antagonism. Both these terms are unsatisfactory in an analysis of Goethe's position, which equally maintains the polarity between the op- posites of the temporal and the eternal and their con- cordance in view of the universe as a whole. Polarity (cf. Thomas, chap. ix) is a concept basic even to spiritualist thinking, which, in spite of its emanationist tendencies, makes a definite distinction between better and worse, a distinction acknowledged by Thomas in Goethe's "Metamorphosis of plants" (p. 187). Dilthey uses the term "aesthetic pantheism" (cf. n. 32) when, in connection with Goethe's reinter- pretation of Spinoza, he explains Goethe's formula- tions as the translation in philosophical terms of a basically poetical disposition. The ontological inter- pretation, which, in criticism of Dilthey, Kurt Leese (pp. 121-22) proposes, leads beyond Dilthey, although precisely in the direction which Dilthey had intended with his studies of "irrationalism." However, Goethe's views are built upon a meta- physics, albeit heuristic or hypothetical and albeit formulated in a technically unsystematic fashion. In this point, Leese's criticism of Dilthey leads further also. To Goethe human knowledge is limited, but not to material phenomena, as the term "agnostic" sug- gests. On the contrary, his Vernunft is the agency of the mind by which man reaches beyond. If his meta- physics, like his Christianity, was intended "for pri- vate use" only (i.e., without the claim of scientific validity), this was a consequence not of agnosticism but of epistemological insight. On Goethe's concept of metamorphosis as a device reconciling rationalism and irrationalism, the "law- fulness of lasting forms and the creative freedom of life," cf. Korff, II, 54 ff. 60 To Boisserie, February 25, 1832. 61 "Mein ganzes inneres Wirken erwies sich als eine lebendige Heuristik, welche eine unbekannte Regel anerkennend, solche in der Aussenwelt zu finden und in die Aussenwelt einzuffihren trachtet" (Maximen und Reflexionen, XXI, 61, No. 328). 62 Erich Franz (Goethe, pp. 243-44) discusses this hypothetical element of Goethe's philosophy of re- ligion in connection with Nietzsche and Vaihinger and (p. 250) with Kant's postulate of the moral law. 63 Cf. the defense of Schelling in Xenien 778 (VIII [18931, 91 and n. on 202): "Ist denn die Wahrheit ein Zwiebel, von dem man die Haute nur abschlt? Was ihr hinein nicht gelegt, ziehet ihr nimmer heraus." Cf. also Italienische Reise (October 23, 1787); Goethe, comparing Herder's book, God, to a bowl, says: "Who has nothing to put into it, finds it empty." 64 West-dstlicher Divan, "Buch des Unmuts": "Und wer franzet oder britet" (JA, V, 50-51).

Mahomet and Iphigenie, Makarie and Epimetheus, indicate that man's ex- istence is relative to a living order, nat- ural but beyond man, which the highest reason (Vernunft), tending toward the divine, can approach.66 The end of Faust and the elevation of Epimetheus in the scheme for the continuation of Pandora present this transcendental relationship through the mediation of love. Limited as man's knowledge is bound to be, the basic truth is conveyed to him "by his heart.""'' The religion of the individual is inward. Its symbolical expression is a testimony for the "pure source of life" which is ac- cessible to every child of God. Goethe conceives of knowledge as a dynamic element of the process of life in the individual and in the history of man- kind. This is possible by virtue of an un- derlying, though hypothetical, metaphys- ics. If learning as a responsive action un- folds the creative personality at the same time as it draws it closely toward the in- ner significance of the object, the latter must be akin to the responding mind. In fact, Goethe presupposes a kinship within the universe, between its parts and be- tween each of them and the whole. In his poem, "Wenn im Unendlichen dasselbe,"68s he describes in a precise and condensed form a conception of the universe as a unity which is composed of parts antag- onistic and dynamically striving within the infinite. In God the Lord they are har- monious calmness. But this universe is differentiated. Like the God of the mystics, Goethe's God speaks out of everything. Nevertheless, there is a distinction between ugly and beautiful, lower and higher, evil and good. Man finds himself in the midst of the ten- sion that is the result of the polarity of creation. The dualism basic to Christian- ity is not wholly eliminated by the certain- ty about "the one," the universal unity. But it is regarded with the intention of translating the higher element into the concreteness of the lower spheres, as well as that of saving the higher from the clutches of evil. The power of discerning values is given to man. If man lives in original sin, he is also given original vir- tue.69 These basic principles of the spiri- tualist religion, transformed by his reti- cent language and his full acceptance of nature, Goethe incorporates into his phi- losophy of life.7" The closest approach to the creative ground which is granted to man consists 86 To Eckermann, February 13, 1829 (Biedermann, IV, 69). 67 Cf. to F. von MUiller (Biedermann, II, 434) about a higher moral order of the world; also Iphigenie auf Tauris (V, 3) on the voice of truth and humanity: "es hirt sie jeder Geboren unter jedem Himmel, dem Des Lebens Quelle durch den Busen rein Und ungehindert fliesst." 68 "Zahme Xenien," VI (JA, IV, 97). 69 Goethe's review of Salvandy's Don Alonzo ou de l'Espagne (JA, XXXVII, 283-89) is included among Goethe's unreserved religious confessions by Erich Franz (Goethe, p. 55) in his valuable appraisal of the sources for our knowledge of Goethe's religious philos- ophy. In connection with the term Pietit, Goethe says in his essay on Salvandy (p. 288): "Wenn gewisse Erscheinungen an der menschlichen Natur, betrachtet von seiten der Sittlichkeit, uns nitigen, ihr eine Art von radikalem B1isen, eine Erbsiinde zuzuschreiben, so fordern andere Manifestationen derselben, ihr gleichfalls eine Erbtugend, eine angeborene Glite, Rechtlichkeit und besonders eine Neigung zur Ehr- furcht zuzugestehen. Diesen Quellpunkt, wenn er im Menschen kultiviert, zur Tatigkeit, ins Leben, zur Offentlichkeit gelangt, nenne wir Piet5,t, wie die Alten." Pietti "wtirde, wenn sie wie durch ein Wunder augenblicklich in alien RMenschen hervortrite, die Erde von allen den iUbeln heilen, an denen sie gegen- wirtig und vielleicht unheilbar krank liegt" (p. 289). Note the relation of Pietat to love, charity, agape, to "eternal love" (cf. n. 163, below), to Ehrfurcht in the Pedagogic Province; cf. also Franz, Goethe, chap. iv, sec. 2, "Religion und Eros." 70 Kurt Leese (chap. ii, sec. 2, p. 135) considers Goethe "a cardinal witness of theological ontology understood as a symbolical metaphysics of the living original Being [des lebendigen Ur-Seins]." He regards Herder's and Goethe's dynamic categories as par- ticularly fit for stating that "the Being of God tran- scends and breaks through everything empirical, but at the same time replenishes it" (p. 131). In this sense he sees Goethe as one of the foremost representatives of the "philosophy of life."</page><page sequence="11">182 ARNOLD BERGSTRASSER in his ability to lift up his reason (Ver- nunft) to "the primary phenomena, physi- cal and moral, through which the divinity reveals itself, behind which it keeps itself, and which emanate from it."" Through the process of life the original form un- folds: Gestalt, the morphological unity, which as an active entelechy underlies the concrete metamorphosis. From the min- eral world72 to the human sphere the di- vine becomes manifest through both spirit and nature. Observing reason comes close to the divine by viewing the unity of devel- oping forms, Gestalt. In each of the parts of the universe, as well as in the whole, such totality expresses itself as unity within the manifold. Man's capacity to recognize, at least heuristically, totality in the multi- tude of phenomena constitutes the su- preme possibility of his mind. The prin- ciple of totality is basic to Goethe's in- vestigation of nature,73 to his doctrine of man,74 and to his philosophy of art. Since macrocosm and microcosm are akin to each other and knowledge is understood as the re-creative response of an analogous being, Goethe's interpretation of the unity within the manifold is more than a meth- od of thinking. It is the common ground of his "physics" and his "metaphysics." "The poetical power of his [Goethe's] cre- ative imagination, his religious energy, his scientific thinking and research-they are one."Y75 Goethe absorbed and maintained fun- damental structures of spiritualist reli- gious thought and a Renaissance philoso- phy of nature. He even adopted some of their typical formulations.76 Among their representatives, Paracelsus and also Jacob Boehme, who was probably not known to Goethe in extenso, are comprehensive in their attempt to embrace the universe, from cosmology to individual sickness and its medicine. Arnold, whose mind was closer to pietism, is primarily concerned with the inward relation of man to di- vine wisdom and through it to God. Con- sequently, he tends more exclusively to- ward introspection than does Boehme. Goethe, on the other hand, developed a strong realism, a self-resigning accuracy of observation, and a keen interest in the concrete phenomena and their differenti- ated multitude. His method reconciles the empirical and the speculative. Where Paracelsus and Boehme make unqualified metaphysical statements, he sets forth his symbolical, hypothetical metaphysics. It is the concrete and the individual that to Goethe open the view upon the primary phenomena and, through them, permit him to approach the higher spheres in a symbolical fashion and by approximation. In a moral sense Goethe felt man to be re- sponsible for a fruitful life, and therefore he emphasized, in contrast to the other- worldliness of Pietists77 and the emotional introspection of spiritualists,7" the state of health indispensable to man's bearing fruit.79 It is fundamental for the translat- 71 To Eckermann, February 13, 1829 (Biedermann, IV, 69). 72 To Jacobi, June 9, 1785: "Das Dasein ist Gott. .

Culture, then, is the manifestation of religious responsibility. 80 Religious devotion, conversely, is "not an end in itself, but a means toward arriving at the highest culture through the purest calm of the soul.'"s8 A strong affinity joins Goethe's classicism to his religious ex- perience. Goethe's postulate of a divinity in- finite and absolute, yet setting forth the living totality of creation; his concept of polarity as the basic form of God's mani- festation through spirit and nature; the kinship of microcosm and macrocosm; love as a dynamic bond between man and divinity-each of these conceptions is re- lated to the spiritualist tradition. Goe- the's evangelical community corresponds to the ecclesia spiritualis; his awareness of grace as reaching within human insight, to inspiration; the source of life audible and present within the individual, to the fortress of the soul, the inner light, the living spark of the mystics.82 The spiritual- ists had been antagonistic to the churches or, at best, had kept apart from them. Goethe, more than they, is averse in prin- ciple to theological disputes, on account both of his fundamental position and of his epistemological skepticism. His "Let- ters of a Pastor"s3 plead for tolerance. The Pastor recognizes the danger of man's reliance upon his limited insight. There- fore, he concentrates in his ministry on re- ligious life in the spirit of Christ's com- mand of love. "No doctrine clears us of prejudices except that which first knows how to break our pride... the realm of God is also found there where I did not seek it . . . Our beloved Lord did not want it to cost an ear to extend his realm."s4 Goethe's passionate antipathy against misleading and narrow doctrines85 is directed against theological dogmatism as well as against conceited skepticism."8 The element of Voltairian power of clarity inherent in his mind served his apology of a healthy and harmoniously balanced conduct. Man is primarily called to pro- duction, and his task, even in relation to truth, consists in bearing fruit.87 Char- acterizing himself, Goethe says that "a poetical urge to form was always active and at work and constituted the core and the foundation of his existence."88 By the rhythm of inward and outward action, of thinking and doing, of immanence and transcendence, man mirrors the universe as a dialectic totality. Deeply inherent in Goethe's character, some of these conceptions early became das Romantische das Kranke."

Goethe's Hellenism itself, however, is as much a function of this creative de- votion to the concreteness of life"9 and to man's task of translating into it his en- telechy. This Hellenism has been aptly called "an effort to establish the basis of values upon which European civilization has been built." 91 It grew out of a religious foundation to which it does not stand in contradiction. Both man and his culture are sharing in nature and spirit as in di- vine manifestations. Man's never ending striving for perfection is therefore not in opposition to his need of salvation.92 Not the basic scheme of spiritualism but its ascetic and speculative tendencies Goethe left behind when he formulated his own religious concepts, which make under- standable his image of Christ. III. GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST Undogmatic both in the sense of un- clericalness and unexclusiveness, Goethe maintained firmly these convictions. His "liberal open-mindedness toward the world""93 had been strengthened in the time of his tension with Lavater, the more so since he observed how even devout Christians transformed the same faith ac- cording to the inclinations of each per- sonality.94 With his social intercourse and his orbit of experience and activity ex- tending from poetry to natural science, from government to literary and artistic criticism, the reality upon which Goethe was intent came to form an integral part of his intellectual world. Its weight and richness reflected upon his religious think- ing, into which it was integrated as into an inseparable whole. In Leonardo's design, Christ appears to this free and urbane mind as a "man of personal nobility bearing a painful suf- fering of his soul.""5 He sees him also as a manifestation of the divine as it radiates "from all noble figures of man."''9 But this God-Man, the "magnificent crystal- clear vessel,""97 is, as we saw, not the only bearer of revelation. In a firm tone of faith Goethe defends his view of "an aristocracy ordained by God" against Lavater's "monarchy of Christ."98 Such pluralism, rather than excluding the divinity of Christ, qualifies it. Goethe's term "di- vine" is in harmony with the spiritualist aspect of his God and permits him also to understand Christ, again by analogy to spiritualism, as a manifestation of the 89 Examples of the early rise of Goethe's basic in- clinations: balance of judgment and conduct, cf. the defense of Bruno against Bayle (Ephemerides, 1770 [Insel, XII, 7]); Spinoza as "homo temperatissimus," therefore valuable to him (to Lavater, June 28, 1774 [Biedermann, I, 35]); God and Nature (Ephe- merides [Insel, XII, 131), "Separatim de Deo, et natura rerum disserere difficile et periculosum est, eodem modo quam si de corpore et anima sejunctim cogitamus." About this passage and its anticipation of the concept of God-Nature, cf. K. Burdach, "Das religiise Problem in Goethes Faust," Euphorion, XXXIII (1932), 82. 90 History as a process of "embodying the spiritual, spiritualizing the bodily, pulsing always among prophets, religious men, poets, orators, artists and friends of art," cf. letter to Eichstadt, March 10, 1815.

It is also de- fined there as the "predominance of the superior guiding power." An upward urge is inherent in it, and it does not dissolve into "the dust."'06 This spirit still shows traits of the pneumatic energy of the spirit in John's Gospel. When Faust trans- lates its opening words,'"' he interprets logos as Word, Meaning, Power, and, finally, Action. Trying to render justice to this fundamental concept, he feels dissat- isfied with the term "the word," because it can be taken as distinct from "mean- ing." Yet the term "meaning" does not convey the active element essential to cre- ation, and therefore he replaces it by "power." Again it proves insufficient, since it carries the connotation of a po- tential divorced from the act by which it gains reality; and so, in the end, he chooses the term "action," to which the previous attempts render a qualifying service. Thus, accompanying the develop- ment of Faust's thought, we arrive at a definition of the creator as an active spir- it, and this emphasis laid upon action re- lates Goethe's concept of creation to the "Fiat" in Paracelsus' and Jacob Boehme's cosmology.108 Goethe's God as an active spirit mani- festing Himself through spirit and nature is a God of life but also of a spiritual law."'9 As Gestalt combines the elements of be- coming and lawfulness through the con- 99 To Eckermann, March 11, 1832 (Biedermann, IV, 443). 10o Faust I (JA, XIII, 53, vs. 1308). 101 Franz Koch, Goethes Stellung zu Tod und Unsterblichkeit (Schriften der Goethe-Gesellschaft, Vol. XLV [1932]), pp. 247 ff.; about Seelenwanderung in connection with Herder's essay (ibid., pp. 267-72); Goethe regards immortality not as a certainty but as a postulate (ibid., p. 289). 102 JA, II, 61, vss. 24, 29. 103 "Gesang der Geister tiber den Wassern" (JA, II, 44 f.).

Cf. West-dstlicher Divan, "Suleika" (JA, V, 88): "Und er sprach das Wort: Es werde! Da erklang ein schmerzlich Ach! Als das All mit Machtgebirde In die Wirklichkeiten brach." The act of creation is also the beginning of indi- viduation and distance from the origin, a painful birth and the first pain. Both Paracelsus and Boehme char- acterize by the term "fiat" the creative action by which the "ens" unfolds. A comparison between their detailed interest in the stages of this process and Goethe's resignation to adumbrate it through sym- bolical language illustrates both his relationship to, and his distance from, Renaissance spiritualism. To Boehme's theosophy, the ternary step from God's hidden existence through the polarity of the multitude of created life to its reconciliation in the unity of eternal life is the fundamental process. He explains the meaning of death "out of which free life is born"; if pain and anxiety did not exist, "the realm of joy" could not be (cf. Ernst Benz, Der vollkommene Mensch nach Jacob Boehme [Stuttgart, 1937], chap. xii). 0to Becoming and life are governed by Being and "law," in Leese (Die Krisis, pp. 13 f.), where the author touches upon the difference of "Goethe's god from that of Boehme and Schelling" with reference to the union of life and law (geprdgte Form).</page><page sequence="15">186 ARNOLD BERGSTRXSSER cept of an original phenomenon unfolding itself, the universe as a whole is lawful to the last manifestation of its original crea- tive power. The cosmology of Dichtung und Wahrheit'ln considered the creation and its destiny as nothing but "an apos- tasy and return to the original"-a dia- lectic process in which the fall of Lucifer is the first, that of man the second, case of separation. Man, ordained to restore the original connection with the divinity, "found himself in the same situation as Lucifer, to be at the same time absolute and restricted"; and it was to be foreseen that "he had to become at the same time the most perfect and the most imperfect, the happiest and the unhappiest crea- ture.""' Related to the divinity and yet distant or even opposed to it, he is in need of salvation. It follows from the spiritual- ist foundation of Goethe's thought, and it corresponds to the conceptions of Plo- tinus and Arnold, to whom Goethe here explicitly refers,12 that such salvation "must renew itself again and again through the whole time of becoming and being."'"3 The significance of Christ with- in this universe is intrinsic and paradig- matic. The appearance of the divinity in human form which conveys "an indispens- able truth" is an intrinsic natural miracle, in that spirit and nature are parts of the universal oneness.114 Christ's appearance is paradigmatic, in that He stands for the union of spirit and nature as the epitome of man's destiny. Consequently, the ironi- cal Goethe deals with the Crucifixion as a consequence of man's insufficiency. Fol- lowing the spirit of John's Gospel,"5 he is even inclined to doubt the historicity of the Crucifixion. He is repelled by its image and considers fallacious the support which orthodox interpreters draw from it for the doctrine of the hopelessly sinful nature of man. The affirmative Goethe, on the other hand, is drawn to Christ as the wise teacher and the victor over earth- ly suffering. Such supreme union of spirit and nature Goethe can conceive only in the image of ultimate beauty, and there- fore he turns to the victorious glory of the resurging Christ. The symbolical form of this affirmation, however, excludes an ex- clusively supra-natural understanding of Christ as well as a magical relationship to Him. Salvation becomes an inner process extending beyond temporal life. The Sav- ior is its supreme example. Goethe's conception of God caused him to have no difficulty in accepting the double character of Christ as a divine and a human being."6 It corresponds to Goe- the's own conviction when Cordata's un- cle concludes from the union of the Cre- ator with Christ, His creature, that "the idea of man is not in contradiction with the idea of divinity" and when he then un- derstands man's feeling of distance from 110 II, 8 (JA, XXIII, 164 ff.).

Whereas Korff (I, 275-76) insists on Goethe's paganism, K. J. Obenauer (Goethe in seinom Verheltnis zur Religion [2d ed.; Jena, 19231, p. 135) stresses this double nature and its correspondence to "Gott-Natur," without A ealizing that the meaning which Goethe connects with the term "divine man" is equally inherent in pagan religions, e.g., in the Greek concept of divinity. It is also related to the phenomenon of genius. Franz (Goethe, p. 268) greatly clarified the controversy about Goethe's relation to Christianity by stating that Korff's sharp formulation can be accepted as referring "to the Christian dogmatics, the system of ecclesiastical metaphysics only, whereas Goethe, on the other hand, not only faced without prejudice the spiritual values of Christianity but was deeply in- fluenced by them in essential points of his whole work." In this understanding the present essay con- siders Goethe's religion of humanity a part of Chris- tian history.</page><page sequence="16">GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST 187 the divine as a challenge to strive for all possible perfection of man who is created in the image of God."17 It is the creative power within man upon which the uncle lays the accent. Christ in this conversa- tion appears as a challenge to man's ac- tivity, which is to be devoted to confirm- ing "the claims of our similarity to God." On the other hand, Goethe's Christ is defi- nitely not the center of human history in relation to time, as Augustine saw Him. It also follows from Goethe's understanding of the Bible as wisdom that to him the quasi-juridical conception of the new pact which the New Testament constitutes has lost its meaning. Christ is a supreme wit- ness to the divine and to the reality of spirit and love and their relation to man- kind rather than the one and only medi- ator between man and God. Goethe ap- proaches Christology in the spirit of John's Gospel and his symbolism permits him to conceive of Christ as the purest and highest spirit, as the spiritualists con- ceived the supra-natural character of Christ by identifying Him with eternal wisdom.118 When, on the other hand, Goethe con- tends that the decision of the church to consider Christ as God supported des- potism;"19 and, when he says that "Jesus' own holy will was offended by those who deified Him,"'12o he attacks the outward divinity, the relation to which is of a mag- ical rather than a mystical character. Such outward divinity had been, it seems, the object even of Prometheus' rebel- lion.121 The basic conceptions of the Credo, however, Goethe interprets in Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre as the active cre- ator, His human incarnation, and the community of "those good and wise in the highest degree," the ecclesia spiritualis. Transformed in this fashion, the Trinity is inherent in his religious thought as much as the double nature of Christ as 117 Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, II (JA, XVIII, 149-50). 118sGottfried Arnold's symbolism: "The hidden meaning of the spirit must never be eliminated, con- demned, or set back by the literal meaning of the word" (Seeberg, p. 412).

L. Saran (Goethes Mahomet und Prometheus [Halle, 19141), 0. F. Walzel (Das Prometheus-Symbol von Shaftesbury zu Goethe [Munich, 1923]), and Korff (I, 281-87). Richter recog- nizes that the Prometheus of the "Fragment" antici- pates the self-resigning and realistic Prometheus of Pandora. He objects to Korff's contention that the rebellion of Prometheus has to be interpreted as a denial of God as the "world despot" and therefore a denial of Christian theism in favor of pantheism. If one excludes, with Korff, the spiritualist theology, the various forms of Christian Platonism, and their combination with the philosophy of nature from the orbit of Christianity, one consequently has to adopt supra-naturalism and the ensuing devaluation of natural life as the exclusive Christian doctrine (Korff, I, 9-12). Then the antagonistic position of Goethe and the eighteenth-century irrationalists against both Protestant orthodoxy and enlightened atheism (Korff, I, 13) gains in conciseness and sharpness. Goethe's religious development can be seen as "the break- through of a new feeling of God" (Korff, I, 281), if the term "new" is confined to the era of German literary revival in the eighteenth century without regard to the old history of this recurring religious impulse. It can- not be maintained, however, that this new feeling destroys "the belief in a metaphysical good and evil, that moral order of the world, to which the individual inescapably is subjected, be it voluntarily in this world [Diesseits] or involuntarily in the other world [Jenseits]" (Korff, I, 287). About the ethical implica- tions of Goethe's views, cf. n. 205 below. The rigidity of Korff's terms forces him also to deny the quality of metaphysics to Goethe's philos- ophy. As Korff himself states, freedom means to Goethe no longer merely the freedom of human reason, which it meant to the Enlightenment phi- losopher, but the divine necessity which originates deep below our reason and works within us. Should this view, which could be called "spiritualistic," be excluded from Christianity, in spite of its comprising the moral law, a considerable part of Christian tradi- tion, and not only that of mysticism, must be ex- cluded with it (cf. Franz, p. 268; Leese, p. 137). His- torically, it is hardly tenable that, as Korff says, the new faith as a "way to God leading through the world" is opposed to the Christian faith (I, 289). About the extent to which Faust can be considered representative of Goethe's own religious views, see Burdach (Euphorion, pp. 74 f.), who admits this only for Faust II, 5. The latter problem was taken up again by Ernst Beutler, Besinnung (Frankfurt, 1946).</page><page sequence="17">188 ARNOLD BERGSTRASSER God and man necessarily follows from his conception of divinity as a will toward creative manifestation. If he then calls the human being "a creature of two worlds,"''22 he sees him between good and evil, as a riddle to be worked out through man him- self, who is placed in the midst of the ten- sion inherent to the universe. A "Xenion" makes a fine distinction between man as created in the image of God and Christ as God's incarnation.123 The Christ who forms the center of reverence in the Pedagogic Province is the man of wisdom whose life is even more fruitful for the noble part of humanity than is his death. "While he exalts the lower to himself; while he makes the ig- norant, the poor, the sick, partakers of his wisdom, of his riches, of his strength, he on the other hand in no wise conceals his divine origin; he dares to equal himself with God-nay, to declare that he him- self is God."'124 He speaks the eternal gos- pel, the divine word. It is active and strikes.125 In Cranach's painting, Goethe sees the Samaritan woman as "she, moved by the weighty words, for the first time turns inward her eye."'26 Mankind feels an unlimited need for "the same light, the same warmth, such as this first one cher- ished and enjoyed with deep feeling and firmest conviction.' 127 This light shines into life. The "divine man" on his temporal way teaches a reli- gion of wisdom, the philosophical religion. In its name he addresses himself to the in- dividual, draws him toward the respect of his equals, and calls forth his awareness of an inner life.'28 Even death is a challenge to living. "Gedenke zu leben," inscribed on the sarcophagus in the hall of the past where Mignon's exequies are held,129 is, as Schiller remarked, triumphant over the memento mori.130 In this eighth book of Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, in which Goethe intended to present the Christian religion in its purest significance,131 the Chorus ends the burial service with the words: "Travel, travel back into life! Take along with you this holy earnestness, for earnestness alone makes life eter- nity."132 This "pure Christ" as the divine revela- tion of the ethical command133 stands in contrast to the entire church history, which is "a mixture of error and vio- lence."134 It meets with Goethe's own thought'35 when Schiller characterizes the distinctive trait of Christianity, because of which it is different from all other mon- otheistic religions, as "the abrogation of the law, or of the Kantian imperative, for which Christianity wants a free inclina- tion [freie Neigung] to be substituted."'36 122 "In uns selbst liegt das Ratsel die wir Ausge- burt zweier Welten sind" (Maximen und Reflexionen, XXI, 88, No. 429). 123 "Zahme Xenien," II (JA, IV, 44, vss. 308-11). 124 Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre, II, 2 (JA, XIX, 190). 125 "Ein g6ttlich Wort, es wirkt und trifft" (West- bstlicher Divan, "Buch der Parabeln" [JA, V, 1101). 126 "Altdeutsche Gemalde," Bilder des eilteren Cranach (JA, XXXV, 10). 127 Visiting Marii Einsiedeln, Dichtung und Wahr- heit, IV, 18 (JA, XXV, 83).

Here faith and courage conquer doubt and despair.38a The Amor Dei of which Faust despaired re-emerges in him with the love of man after his return from the Easter promenade.'a9 They are one in Goethe's Christ. Longing and love for His kind bring Him back to earth after God had called Him.140 His call had reached Him when he helped a woman to give birth to her child.141 The power of faith and of love, of wisdom and action, in their spirit are the foremost qualities of this Christ of whom Goethe said "God visibly was with Him and His first disciples."142 To the pupils of Goethe's Pedagogic Province the pictures of the living Christ alone are disclosed during the education. Only on the day when they are released into adult life are they shown the paint- ings which present Christ's suffering and crucifixion. "The image of misery on the cross" to which the Divan refers, 43 the crucifix which Mignon fervently kisses in her last moments,144 the representation of Christ's suffering and death-in the Prov- ince it is concealed in "the sanctuary of suffering." The Eldest of the Province ex- plains to Wilhelm that it is a high respect "which does not allow one to play with these deep secrets in which the divine depth of suffering is hidden."145 In the Pedagogic Province the term "Christian" is particularly connected with the core of Christianity as the religion of "those who fight sufferingly and are glorified in suf- fering."'46 It corresponds to reverence for the things below us, which, together with reverence for the things around us and reverence for those above us, constitutes the basis of education and develops the reverence of man for himself. Not the suffering itself but the victory over it Goethe considers the decisive mo- ment of Christ's existence. It brings to the fore the heavenly, the eternal, which "is implanted in the body of earthly purposes and is carried along into finite des- tinies."'47 Goethe intended to show in his "Mahomet" how in the course of his career the secular grows and expands and the divine recedes and is troubled until, near his death, he returns to the original higher significance of his message, purifies his doctrine, and dies.148 Within the dia- lectic dualism inherent in the universal, the divine is ultimately triumphant. On the cloth with which the loving Veronica covers the Savior's face, Ahasuerus sees "the face of the Lord-not of the Lord who is suffering in this moment but of Him gloriously transfigured and radiating 137 "Zu malende Gegenstiande," Schriften zur Kunst, III (JA, XXXV, 302). 138 Cf. also to Eckermann, February 12-13, 1831 (Biedermann, IV, 321, 323).

A poem of 1827 interprets the descent to hell as announcing the Resurrection. Both poems present a glorious Christ; the shorter and later one uses the opposition of descent and ascension, besides other symbols of the universal polarity-the falling and the rising water, the flame to be kindled in the abyss.152 The image of Christ symbolizes to Goethe an experience inherent in the "heroic" quality of his re- ligious convictions. "It is characteristic of the human soul that it elevates itself the quickest when it is most heavily weighted down."''5 In the image of resurrection Goethe wanted the artist to present Christ "emerging from the tomb ... di- vinely revived, in glorified virile form and decent nakedness."'14 The unbelieving Faust is saved from self-destruction by the Easter message, which announces the hope granted to men through the Master who met the test of pain.155 The "transfiguration was the pledge of eternal life," says Goethe with a historical view of Christianity.'5 Christ "stood be- fore a background where the Creator had unfolded the universe, from Him emanat- ed a spiritual influence, His sufferings were understood as an example." These remarks from Makariens Archiv disclose once more the relationship of Goethe's view of the risen Christ to his understand- ing and use of spiritualist concepts and, ultimately, of Plotinus' intelligible world of the pure spirits.'57 If spirit is indestructi- ble-and here is meant the spiritual part of man-158 then earthly life is a prepara- tory test. Goethe believes that the eternal- ly living God, upon the return to the ether of the active entelechy, "will not deny it new activities, analogous to those in which we already have proved ourselves."'59 The 149 Dichtung und Wahrheit, III, 15 (JA, XXIV, 230).

Its understanding of "the Christ or Logos in ourselves who is diffused through all creatures"'61 is basic to its freedom of exegesis and-in prin- ciple-from organization. Transfigura- tion is an event of metamorphosis which forms an integral part of Goethe's sym- bolism of the spiritual world. Mahomet and Faust in the end experience salvation. We leave Faust when his immortal part moves upward. Epimetheus is rejuvenated and elevated, together with the returned Pandora.'62 In the Paradise of the Divan the eternal cycles are described, "which are penetrated by the pure and lively tone of God's word, through which the souls prompted by ardent desire lose them- selves in the intuition of eternal love."'16"" Although this Dantesque image of love as the spirit victorious over matter, of love as the prime mover and the ultimate end, could not have the medieval poet's dog- matic power,164 it translates into terms of a spiritual concept an experience underlying even the most classical creation of Goe- the's poetry-the experience of love as the uniting bond between lower and higher, between the human and the divine. When at the end of Faust a view opens toward the infinite, the figures of una poenitentium, formerly called "Gretchen," and of Faust himself are shown in an up- ward movement of which love is the de- terminant force. Faust's ascension is in- deed akin to Dante's ascension in the Paradiso.165 In this universe the Amor Dei is an inherent element of human existence. The responding grace is inherent in the divine order. Love is a supreme quality of the Prime Mover, the "all-loving Fa- ther."166 Christ is its manifestation. Even the ironical tone of the fragment, "The eternal Jew," changes into that of sincere affection when "the friend of man" re- turns to earth.'67 The command of love is the core of Christ's indispensable truth. Christ, ennobling everything he touches,168 left on the Four Gospels the re- flection of a sublimity which is of "so divine a character as ever on earth the divine became manifest.""'6 Der nie ent- sprossene,170 called identical with the Creator in Faust's magic formula, is in- herent in the sphere where the reconcilia- tion of the antagonistic parts of the world drama occurs, where, after the apostasy, 160oConcerning Goethe and John's Gospel cf. letter to Herder, February 20, 1786: "I recommend you John's Gospel again and again, whose content comprises Moses and the prophets, evangelists and apostles: Children love each other. And so me also." Colwell (chap. viii) discusses the allegorical character of John's work and emphasizes that "knowing God through Christ" was of prime importance to John rather than the facts of Jesus' career. This symbolical way of religious experience is essential to spiritualism and makes itself felt also in Goethe's symbolism. 161 In connection with Sebastian Franck cf. Ernst Troeltsch.

He represents, mild and loving Him- self, the same holiness of the spirit which mildly leads "to Him who created and creates everything."'73 Mildness is a char- acteristic quality often recurring when Goethe touches upon the reconciliation of antagonisms which only through the mediation of a higher element we can hope to be satisfactory.'74 And we hear a sim- ilar tone when Goethe speaks of hope: Elpore thraseia, "courageous hope," is Pandora's and Epimetheus' child. Hope elevates us beyond necessity;"'5 and for those active in applying the forces of the good, the crowns are made in eternal calm- ness, wherefrom the voices of the masters call: "We ask you to have hope.""' The faith by which the poet of the Divan feels refreshed'77 is an image serene as the Lord's image on Veronica's cloth.'78 As Christ's victory is here translated into beauty, so Goethe held that religious de- votion was possible only if directed either to the "formless holy in us and around us" or else to the incarnation of the highest beauty.1'7 Such a relation of religious worship to the aesthetic discloses more than does the inclination of the artist toward the beauti- ful. It indicates that Goethe's spiritualist mysticism and his classical concept of art have a common basis. Goethe conceives of man as sharing in both spirit and nature. He understands his mortality, at least hypothetically, as a metamorphosis in- herent in the character of the universe.s80 He understands the Creator Himself as continuously at work.'8s The totality of these views converges in his praise of the serenity of man's action to the honor of the divinity. "Joy and participation in things is the only thing real and again produces reality."'s2 Untouched by the storm of the theological dispute, the old artist of Ephesus in Goethe's poem'83 reads "the full breadth of divinity" and continues with his work of adorning the image of his goddess. Goethe's urge also to translate into con- creteness his impulses and concepts limits his adoption of mystical forms. As Bur- dach remarks,184 he transformed Hafis' 171 JA, vs. 1308. 172 JA, vs. 1307. 173 "Eins und Alles" (JA, II, 244, vss. 10-12).

Its aim is rather disclosed as a call to the active and devoted conduct of the Ephesian goldsmith. The image of the returning Christ who comes to be crucified a second time corre- sponds to Goethe's conception of life, his fate to the dualism of the human situa- tion as a riddle, such as Faust's tragedy demonstrates it to be. Goethe's religion is realistic and therefore indeed "heroic."'287 He faces the gulf which crosses right through man's existence and, in spite of it, resumes the ever renewed task of active reconciliation. In the light of Goethe's be- lief in the freedom of a truly evangelical community, 88 his image of the returning Christ gives a particular significance to a sentence in his last conversation with Eckermann: "All of us will proceed more and more from a Christianity of the word and the faith to a Christianity of inward disposition and action."'89 If salvation is an eternally necessary process,190 then there are human beings whose personal- ities exemplify the reconciliation of spirit and nature. It was in this sense that Schil- ler understood the figure of Natalie in Wilhelm Meister as holy and human at the same time.'19 IV. THE PURELY HUMAN A religious seriousness of the kind that Goethe described in Wilhelm Meister formed the ground common to his poetical production, his conception of the artist, and his philosophy of nature. It is ex- pressed in his metaphysical poems, as well as through the figures and the contem- plative statements in his novels and criti- cal writings. The abbe in his letter to Wil- helm calls this attitude Weltfr6mmigkeit. He uses this term when explaining the ultimate aim of the utopian settlement which the society of Wilhelm's friends ex- pects to establish. The abb6 wishes Wil- helm to prepare himself to become "an in- dispensable link in our chain." Welt- fr6mmigkeit is requested beyond Haus- fr6mmigkeit, because it does more than establish that inner certainty of the in- 185 It is this responsibility for concreteness and classical form and the corresponding denial of "ro- mantic darkness" in thinking which separates Goethe from a symbolism and a mythology like that of F. I. Gorres. To the defender of such "Dionysian" cos- mogony Goethe's tempered "Apollinian" conception looks pale (cf. Leese, III, 4, and Goethe, Maximen und Reflexionen, XXI, 109, No. 504: "Alles, was unseren Geist befreit, ohne uns die Herrschaft Uiber uns selbst zu geben, ist verderblich"). I86 Materialien zur Geschichte der Farbenlehre, "Robert Boyle" (JA, XL, 221). 187 The continuous effort to unite the "higher" and the "lower" in the process of life is the core of this heroism. Cf. Korff (II, 422 f.) about the "Faustian religion as an unmistakable creation of its own kind" with Goethe's conception of individual religion.

Conversely, he calls Cordata only a saint, Therese only a perfect hu- man being. That he calls Natalie also "the only aesthetic personality" illustrates his and Goethe's understanding of the term "aesthetic" as the concrete appearance of the union between reason and emotion and, on a higher level, spirit and nature. Cf. Schiller, Ober die aesthetische Erziehung des Menschen, 4th letter ("totality"), 11th letter ("personality"): "Die Anlage zu der Gottheit tr~igt der Mensch unwider- sprechlich in seiner Pers6nlichkeit in sich; der Weg zu der Gottheit, wenn man einen Weg nennen kann was niemals zum Ziele ftihrt, ist ihm aufgetan in den Sinnen" (Insel, V, 405).</page><page sequence="23">194 ARNOLD BERGSTRAXSSER dividual upon which the firmness and dig- nity of the whole is ultimately built. Be- yond this, Weltfr6mmigkeit means a reso- lution "to correlate our honest human convictions practically with a wide field of action, and to further not only those next to us, but at the same time to take with us mankind as a whole."'92 The citizen of the world feels responsible for orienting his activities toward the whole, even when, in practice, they are confined to a compara- tively small realm. The piety underlying the opinions and actions of the citizen of the world is equally devoted to the whole. It comprises all aspects of man's relation to God-Nature. Without such piety the action of Wilhelm's friends could not have a relation to the concept of mankind. Without including the love of the world, of nature, and of art, their faith would re- main unconnected with their activity. In terms of Christianity, Weltfrimmig- keit is an active and social, almost social- istic, fulfilment of the command of love. It is nourished by the conviction that the individual forms a part within a living whole, that he is akin to other parts and capable of mirroring the structure of the whole. Therefore, he is also in a position to lend structure and meaning to the do- main allotted to him and his community, to decide in freedom about the best way of action, and to take it. Goethe's utopia proceeds from the psychological insight into man to the collective undertakings of a community of men thinking and acting in a spirit of fellowship, which is guided by Weltfr~mmigkeit. This piety is inner- worldly. In it there survives the classical mystic teaching that God speaks through everything. Although even Eckhart could be understood as calling for otherworldli- ness, Goethe places man in the midst of the concrete conditions under which he is supposed to live. As in mystic wisdom, joy and pain are responsibilities to be faced with equal obedience; but the mind is challenged by the knowable and the unknowable, by the task of action and the problem of contem- plation, with an equally urgent call. Search and action, calmness and respect, each in its proper place, are of equal value. The freedom which Weltfr6mmigkeit con- veys excludes an oriental rejection of na- ture or a pessimistic contempt of the body. Whoever lives according to it ac- cepts and even loves the "garment of divinity" which the Erdgeist is weaving. Yet, in spite of all devotion to the con- creteness of life, the mind is independent of it. The mind reaches into a stratum be- yond the phenomenal world and is there- fore able to sustain the rhythm of think- ing and doing,193 the systole and diastole of living, which, as a basic and simple task, is inherent in the nature of man. Thus knowledge forms a step toward wis- dom. The cause of Adam's fall is also the chance of man's elevation. Weltfr6mmig- keit turns the individual toward the art of living rather than toward the art of dying. Such orientation of piety toward positive living results from a spiritualist view of unity, of God in nature, when it is active- ly translated into the concrete conditions and tasks, both individual and social, of man's life in a given time and a given place. To this Weltfrimmigkeit Goethe gave allegorical expression through his "Cross in Roses."'""4 The pilgrim Markus in Goethe's poem "Die Geheimnisse," de- scending with the sinking sun to a peace- ful valley, arrives at a monastery.

It reminds him of its message of consolation and hope, of the significance which the Christian cross has had to thousands of minds and hearts for whom it has de- stroyed the power of death. But the cross which he sees here presents to him an "en- tirely new meaning": Es steht das Kreuz mit Rosen dicht um- schlungen, Wer hat dem Kreuze Rosen zugesellt? Es schwillt der Kranz, um recht von allen Seiten Das schroffe Holz mit Weichheit zu begleiten. Out of this image "a holy life of threefold rays emerges from one point." The cross in roses bears the sign of the Trinity. Erected on the entrance door of the mon- astery and reappearing in the assembly hall, it is of central significance to this community of men, which reminds one of Goethe's "wise and good to the highest de- gree." Their fellowship stands for his translation into terms of Weltfrimmigkeit of the ecclesia spiritualis. The elder, Hu- manus, is the holy man, in whose breast the "Peace of God" is dwelling. His mirac- ulous life is related to the visitor as being a chain of difficult tests which he withstood victoriously. He does not owe the wisdom and freedom which are his to the gifts of nature alone but also to the way in which he made use of them. Resignation, his vic- tory over himself, was the decisive means toward his freedom.'19 Humanus is at the end of his journey and about to leave the world. Already he is elsewhere in spirit, having conveyed what was his to his com- panions. Their lives, like his, had been lives of action, suffering, and victory, leading to wisdom and serenity. It is in harmony with this polarity that on the cross of the community the roses do not cover the roughness of the wood but accompany it by their softness. The two elements are reconciled, neither becoming predominant. Goethe had the event which was to elevate Markus to the succession of Humanus happen in the week of Easter. He definite- ly related it thereby to Christianity, whose cross, as he said with reference to these stanzas, "he honored and adorned as man and poet."'96 Humanus is the leading figure of a hu- man and humane religion. Without en- gaging in argumentation, Goethe sym- bolically expresses the heroic character of its piety, its beauty, and its wisdom through the figures of the poem and through the sign in whose name they live together. One may interpret the poem as a translation of Christianity into terms of religious humanism.197 It should rather be taken, however, as the symbol of an "in- dividual" religious conviction arising from the responsible acceptance of both the pain and the beauty of man's and nature's creativeness. As a primary and genuine re- ligious experience, it is a testimonial of its originator to the "power and courage per- taining to this attitude""'98 of creating re- ligious symbols in individual freedom. The poem once more testifies to Goethe's faith in the reconciliation of the poles of life through the concrete process of living it- self. Its problem, however-that of the possibility of such reconciliation between roughness and mildness, between this- worldly and otherworldly elements of life --inevitably occurs wherever salvation is contemplated as an inward and mysti- cal, rather than a transcendental and magical, act. 195 To Zelter, June 1, 1831. 196 Victory over himself is requested from Tasso; resignation, emphasized by the subtitle of Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre, is the basis of the community whose life and activities the novel develops. 197 Lowith, p. 32: "Goethe hebt das Christentum in der Humanittit auf und die Geheimnisse offenbaren, was das 'Rein-Menschliche' ist." 198 Franz, p. 228.

Like Natalie he is neither a merely secular nor a merely holy person but the integra- tion of both. In Humanus' realm, Markus observes beautiful youths, coming back from nocturnal dances with torches in their hands. Under the sign of the cross in roses, the Greek and the Christian heri- tage seem to unite. The contrast to Lu- ther's coat-of-arms could not be greater. On a black cross, white roses hold the hu- man heart.'"9 To the faithful disciple of Christ, Luther's cross indicates transcen- dental joy, promising consolation for suf- fering and already making itself felt on earth through the strength of faith. The contrast between the two crosses corre- sponds to the difference between the two re- ligious concepts. In Humanus' domain man is exposed to the polarity of life as an agent of independent experience, although not without the guidance of inspired and test- ed wisdom or without the community of others. There the significance of Christ is both paradigmatic and historical. The supra-naturalist theologian, on the other hand, can attach primary significance neither to the historical nor to the paradig- matic Christ. "No personality of world history is of interest to him."200 Recon- ciliation itself is transcendental, as is grace, which alone fulfils man's relation to God. Not the community but its antith- esis between the divine and the human should be emphasized. Culture is part of the realm of sin, and even Goethe's inter- pretation of cultural activity means losing one's self to the world. Measuring his own faith by such supra-naturalist standards, Goethe is right when he calls himself "an old pagan."'01 Christ could not be Goe- the's Lord in the sense of the First Com- mandment, nor his one and only mediator to God. Not Christ alone made him recog- nize the situation of man as much as His image illustrated it. Not Christ alone made Goethe aware of divine love and of the love of mankind or granted to him "an ethical attitude toward historical real- ity."202 Wherever Goethe met with such tran- scendental radicalism, he refused to fol- low. Man to him remains a fragmentary and restricted being, destined to live through apostasy to reconciliation. In view of his journey of life, man is en- dowed, as a child of God, with potential "original virtue." Man's pride should not be broken. But man should set it on the right object. This is reverence for himself, resulting from an active development of reverence in the three directions corre- sponding to those of the Credo. Man is not free from guilt, but his answer to it is a renewed effort. It is not a pure flame that emerges when the matter of human life is kindled by "the pure fire taken from the altar."203 Through his inner and outer fate Werther demonstrates the ethical failure and the religious problem of the autonomous self.204 The novel Die Wahl- verwandtschaften culminates in the ac- l99 L6with, pp. 33 f. 200 Brunner, p. 51. Brunner adds: "The synthesis found by mysticism is too cheap, as is the synthesis of rationalistic systems .... Behind all of them we find the self-confidence of men, divorced from God, in the power remaining to him." 201 To Jacobi, February 1, 1808. 202 Cf. the exposition of these tenets by Brunner, pp. 538 ft.; also "Das Einmalige, der Glaube an den Mittler, ist die einzig ernsthafte Entscheidung" (p. 560). 203 "Ilmenau" (JA, I, 276 ff.). 204 Herbert Sch6ffier, Die Leiden des Jungen Werther: Ihr geistesgeschichtlicher Hintergrund (1938), made an important contribution to the religious inter- pretation of the novel and compared the end of the novel with corresponding passages of John's Gospel. The metaphysical problem of Werther's character found a noteworthy interpretation also by Wilhelm Flitner, Goethe im Spdtwerk (Hamburg, 1947), pp. 52-56, where the author contends that Goethe con- ceived the reason of Werther's suffering as guilt from the composition of the novel onward. Consequently, his later statement, "Sei ein Mann und folge mir nicht nach," appears as an explanation rather than a retraction (p. 55).</page><page sequence="26">GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST 197 ceptance of guilt and demonstrates the ethical law as a reality. Error and guilt are inherent in man's striving.205 Goethe's Faust has been called the "epitome of an existential tragedy."206 The infinite urge and the interminable longing of this Faust are signs of the divine part of his nature. Recurring failure, renewed effort, and re- peated guilt accompany him to his end, and yet he is saved-not because of his achievements but because of his striving is it possible that grace may come to him. Goethe denied neither that man was sin- bound and egoistic nor that man's efforts were fragmentary and temporal. But he considered him capable of doing good and held the renewed attempt to develop his original virtue the proper answer to failure and guilt. Goethe's human being is susceptible and akin to the mildness of higher forces. But these forces are not only the objects of his hope. Man is held responsible for in- corporating them into the concreteness of his life in spite of failure, and he can do so because he is not radically evil. He is not an autonomous and unbroken entity by himself, but he is engaged in a continu- ous trial, destined to reconcile the poles inherent in life. Christ's crucifixion gives evidence of the tragic nature of this po- larity; his resurrection symbolizes its meaning as the ultimate triumph of higher forces. Interpreted as "the manifestation of the ethical law," Goethe's Christ is paradigmatic for the reconciliation and its problematical character. Christ, whom he once wished to present to man as his friend instead of his tyrant,207 is con- ceived as the "pure Christ" in the sense of the "purely human." "Das rein menschliche," then, as ex- pressed by Humanus' religious way of life, is not identical with the "merely" human. The purity in man is related in the struc- ture of Goethe's thought to the purity of the gospel and to the pure Christ. The method of interpretation used by the spiritualists in the following of John's Gospel consisted, as we saw, in eliminating from his image the social and historical ac- cidentals. Thereby, they arrived, at first, at conceiving a timeless picture of Christ's wisdom and self-sacrificing love, and from there they proceeded toward their sym- bolical view of Christ as identical with eternal wisdom. Through his realism in observation Goethe modified the method of their hermeneutics.208 But its principle is upheld by the symbolical nature of his thinking, which applies a means of pres- entation intrinsic to art upon both nat- ural science and religion. Thus the figures of Goethe's poetical work are intended to make transparent this "purely human" core of man's existence. The personality of man is related to a lasting truth, which, however, is accessible only through the obscure medium of the phenomenal world. In terms of Goethe's hypothetical meta- physics, his poetical figures stand in the midst of the process through which the parallelism of immanence and transcend- ence operates: Spirit is embodied and body is spiritualized. The "purely human" shall gain concreteness, the lower shall be "ennobled." This process of reconciliation consti- tutes the meaning of man's life and deter- mines man's ethical task. Personality may be the highest happiness of the chil- dren of the earth,209 yet man achieves his personality not simply by working out his entelechy but by reconciling it to the 205 Wahlverwandtschaften, cf.

Goethe's conception of freedom is deter- mined by man's voluntary recognition of, and his obedience to, the universal law. Without such capacity for transcending himself, man will not obtain personality.210 Goethe's utopia of the human community is likewise conceived in view of man's ac- tive effort toward reconciliation. The mon- astery of Humanus, the two societies of Wilhelm Meister, or the original com- munity adumbrated in Pandora's return are images of social bodies whose educa- tion and government is formed according to such a conception of man. The community which, in Pandora's return, emerges out of the new union be- tween Pandora and Epimetheus gives their proper places to art and science. They are at work in front of a curtain which conceals the patent secret-the sphere of truth itself. To divine it is granted to man through the symbolical image.21 To this essential factor of the sit- uation of man the mission of art and sci- ence corresponds. It is one of mediation between the one and the manifold, the temporal and the eternal. Their products are historical and subject to revision, change, and oblivion. Their concrete con- tent will never exhaust the truth. They will be of active significance only as long as their symbolical forms share in the lan- guage and understanding of human soci- ety. Nevertheless, by approximation the products of art and science disclose lasting truth. But the written word is always os- cillating toward a Platonic idea never to be adequately expressed. The original phe- nomenon forms the closest approach to it. Man's intellectual existence is bound to be one of continuous daring. His imperfec- tion and imperfectibility are the counter- part of his creative capacities. Art and science are historical, that is, they are part of the process of living. Yet they transcend the "merely" secular realm. The "purely human" is the element in- herent in man himself which leads beyond the "merely human." The difficulty which Goethe's position creates, in view of any attempt to estab- lish rationally firm and reliably seizable principles of faith and conduct, is well il- lustrated by the history of the devalua- tion and misunderstanding of his religious humanism.212 Goethe's own antagonism against the ideologies rising toward the end of his lifetime, particularly his aver- sion to political experimentation on the ground of such ideologies, is a reflection of this difficulty. The basic structure of this tension is no different from the rela- tion between the religious spiritualists and the church. In the light of the free evan- gelical community or, in secularized terms, the voluntarily chosen freedom of self-resigning men, formal organization is a matter of emergency and a tribute to in- sufficiency. The principal aspects of this tension, however, illustrate the signifi- cance of Goethe's concept of the "purely human." The indispensable consequence of Goe- the's humanity is the freedom of the in- dividual within the limits of a social order 210 Cf. Hugo von Hofmannsthal, "Aufzeichnungen zu Reden in Skandinavien," Corona, II (1932), 387 if., about freedom and law. Hofmannsthal sees Goethe's concept of law develop from the titanic period of independence in the Sturm und Drang era through a second phase, culminating in the victory of the idea of law in Tasso. In the Wahlverwandtschaften this concept of law forms the center of the tragic plot. It is the purided personality in which law and freedom attain harmonious concordance. "Goethes Idee des Werdens schloss eine Idee des Miissens ein, und seine Idee der Form schloss eine Idee des Gesetzes ein. Seine Sittlichkeit ist aus religids erfasstem Natursinn abgeleitet" (p. 390). 211 Arnold Bergstraesser, "Mensch und Staat im Wirken Goethes-Pandora," Corona, VI (1935-36), 119 ff. 212 Karl Ldwith greatly contributed to the dis- cussion of this problem.

Nohl, Vol. IX [1929]), reviews the devaluation of the concept of humanity and its impact upon educational ideas.</page><page sequence="28">GOETHE'S VIEW OF CHRIST 199 which serves the individual personality by its ethical organization. This postulate of freedom becomes the less acceptable, the more the collectives of state and nation are conceived as values in themselves. It is denied as soon as the conduct of man in the service of these collectives is justifi- able by an ethics separate from, or even antagonistic to, the ethical law valid for the individual. Goethe was sufficiently ex- perienced in public life not to confuse his utopia of human community with the goals attainable under the concrete condi- tions of public affairs. His inclination to- ward concreteness, together with this per- sonal experience, may have caused him to choose for his utopian image in Wilhelm Meister a society of men of good will like that of Freemasons rather than a state. The concrete state itself was to him, at best, an occasion for the work of such men of good will. Not only the omnipotent po- litical community but even the overem- phasis on the values connected with a law- ful public organization seemed to him con- trary to the balance between community and individual which he held conducive to the realization of the "purely human."213 In the domain of religious organization this tension becomes even more evident. Simmel held that all church-building re- ligions would have to exclude Goethe's God-Nature, according to its formal prin- ciple.214 Like Goethe himself, as we saw, the intellectual ancestors of this concep- tion were as much averse to organized religion as the representatives of the latter often proved hostile to them. The conflict between the returning Christ and the church is necessarily inherent in a religious attitude which emerges from a spiritualist background. Every doctrinary ecclesias- tical tendency, not merely that of mid- nineteenth-century Germany, must dis- play opposition against Goethe's human- ism. For responsible and creative minds his "free evangelical community" claims the privilege of living outside church or- ganization. He pursued the principle of re- ligious freedom so far as to consider reli- gion a matter of individual growth and re- sponsibility and thereby doubted the clerical raison d'etre even of the Protestant church. By giving a religious meaning to the realm of the beautiful, the cross in roses subordinates the aesthetic to the re- ligious. No human concern is without re- ligious significance. On the other hand, the principal tenet of Continental Protestant- ism-the emphasis on the radical sinful- ness of the temporal sphere-is not ac- ceptable. Man is called to live to the honor of God. The church represents religion within society. It is therefore tempted to devaluate man's secular concern in order to balance it with his eternal concern. What the church may separate, the spirit- ualist keeps united. Goethe conceived as the lived religion the mutual permeation of the secular and the eternal.215 Goethe's distance from organized reli- gion is less exclusive, however, than his conception of the balance of human facul- ties is incompatible with any doctrine built upon a one-sided reliance on rational analysis. Goethe's concepts of Gestalt and metamorphosis were related to his prin- ciple of totality. His view of society in- cluded the polarity inherent in the situa- tion of man. A concept of evolution in terms of a materialistic biology may pre- sent a partial truth, but any doctrine built upon it which pretends to be of general importance stands in opposition to Goe- the's views.

The history of the interpretation and biogra- phy of Goethe reflects the tendency, par- ticularly strong in the middle of the nine- teenth century, toward losing sight of the religious foundation of his personality and his work. When understood purely as a matter of intellectual education, of Bil- dung in a degenerate meaning of the term, Goethe's thought does not yield its sig- nificance.216 In the light of Goethe's conception of harmony and totality, each of these an- tagonistic attitudes is eccentric. Each of them pretends to master more certainty than Goethe believes to have been granted to man. None of them faces the polarity inherent in the situation of man in Goe- the's own balancing fashion. The deifica- tion of state and nation or the invalida- tion of the ethical principle within their domain is an apostasy from humanity. The exclusive confidence in the intellect (Verstand) deposes reason (Vernunft) from its function and denies to man the responsible use of those faculties of his mind which, in Goethe's opinion, are its higher and nobler parts. The certainty of supra-naturalism not only exceeds the limits of human knowledge but claims pos- session of a revealed wisdom without ac- knowledging the inevitably anthropo- morphic character inherent in the expres- sion of every revelation and of the infer- ences drawn from it. To Goethe the temporal remains a par- able. The only way of coming closer to the patent secret which it holds is the symbol which the creative mirror of man's mind is capable of producing. "Man in his dis- course with God can only use his own words."217 The philosopher and the the- ologian no less than the poet build upon vision.218 Measured by the modest but firm self-resignation of Goethe's religious views,219 the impassioned claim of extra- human certainty on the part of supra- naturalists lacks in humility and respect. It may even lack in faith, if such certainty is expressed, "as if it were spoken immedi- ately in the name of God."220 The human being, as Goethe sees him, is subject to becoming and passing away, that is, to the metamorphosis, the Stirb und Werde, of the universe. Although man's reason is inferior to divine reason, his fragmentary mind is capable of mirroring the whole of which he is a part. Yet the divine ground itself is concealed from him. But man is not therefore abandoned to a blind fate, never to be mastered. That he has to rediscover his standards again and again, that he has to reformulate his faith in every phase of his civilization, does not mean that they are denied him. Faith as a power is a potential inherent in man. Faith as a formulated expression of his relation to the unknown and of the meaning which it gives to his life is a part 216 A foremost representative of such tendencies was David Friedrich Strauss. In his Der alte und der neue Glaube not only does he propose to substitute the literary classics for the gospel, but he is unable even to recognize the religious foundation of this litera- ture. In view of such misinterpretations, Kierkegaard's criticism of Goethe is not surprising. 217 Erich Frank, Philosophical understanding and religious truth (New York, 1945), p. 97. 218 Xenien, p. 91, No. 789: "Wird der Poet nur geboren?

Whoever maintains "the modern dualism between religious think- ing and cultural philosophy"222 is in dan- ger of forfeiting the significance of Goe- the's conceptions. Both the Epimethean and the Promethean elements are con- stitutive for the utopia of a good life and a healthy education, in the midst of which Goethe put his image of Christ. From the Renaissance philosophy of nature Goethe had proceeded to a devoted observation of nature's phenomena. Yet he conceived them as manifestations of the universal unity. Likewise, the religious impulse of spiritualism supported his in- clination against both a magical and a ra- tionalistic relation to the divine. The step he took beyond the mystical implication of the spiritualist religious attitude was determined by the same intention toward clarity of form which is characteristic of his studies in nature. Such clarity was available to him in the myth. He proceed- ed from the mystical to the mythical.223 In his Novelle224 he tells a myth which is significant for the religious character of his "pure humanity." The myth of the lion and his taming is another symbol of the higher forces which are triumphant in the midst of life, of the strength of mildness against the threat of the wild element. These forces are at work through man, anonymous and without social status, through the purely human. The leading figure among them is a child. Step by step the reader is led forward to the surprising conflict and its unforeseeable solution. Only in the end does the world experience and the anticipating foresight of the uncle prove to result from his awareness of the human situation. He holds it fundamen- tally uncertain: he sees government as subject to change in spite of all wisdom and care; he knows the unbridled elements which are always ready to invade the zone of order, calm, and happiness. The land- scape meaningfully laid out, the past har- moniously united to the present, the peo- ple of the mountains co-operating by a useful exchange with those on the plains- this whole picture of peace and reason conveys the expectation of future happi- ness. Suddenly and with irresistible vio- lence, the wild element of fire bursts into this realm, and a second catastrophe im- mediately threatens to follow the first one. The wild animals break out. Honorio's this-worldly virtue, his knightly courage and devotion, seem to equal the princess' spirited beauty, when he saves her life 221 Paul Tillich in Hegel und Goethe (Tiibingen, 1932), p. 47, characterized the religious view of German classicism as related to one particular his- torical moment or kairos. Beyond it he denies it a paradigmatic significance. On the one hand, he relates it to the social structure in which it emerged and which, it is correct, irrevocably belongs to the past. On the other hand, he contrasts Goethe's thought to the prophetic spirit, his image of man and culture to the religious pneuma. The latter, however, as soon as it comes to action and takes form, inevitably ex- presses itself through the medium of culture; the former will not be understood unless conceived as transcending the merely temporal sphere. An ap- proach to the cultural heritage which considers it as a social phenomenon exclusively pertaining to one par- ticular period of history comes close to historical rela- tivism and denies the works of man a significance inde- pendent of time and place. Then, the humanities as a field of learning have merely an antiquarian function and lose their meaning as a living and dynamic part of civilization. Historical and sociological interpreta- tions, pursued within their proper limits, make it evi- dent, on the other hand, that this cultural heritage cannot be wholly understood in their terms, because the creativity of the past through its products may attain timeless significance. 222Martin Doerne ("Religion und Kultur bei Herder," Zeitschrift fiir deutsche Bildung, V [1929], 298) calls this dualism "abnormal" and "untenable." 223 Maximen und Reflexionen, XXI, 114, No. 535; 240, No. 1150. 224 Kurt May ("Goethes 'Novelle,' " Euphorion, XXXIII 11932], 277-99) gives an extensive interpre- tation of the Novelle on the basis of its linguistic structure. Cf. also Ernst Beutler, "Ursprung und Gehalt von Goethes 'Novelle,' " D VfLuG, XVI (1938), 324-52; in our connection, e.g., 332-33.</page><page sequence="31">202 ARNOLD BERGSTRASSER from the tiger. But what he did was in vain. The tiger was tame for those who knew how to handle him. In front of the woman who, fearing for the lion, appeals to his humanity, Honorio's heroism dis- solves into fancy. The hero of the Novelle is the child. With his song, like another Daniel, he tames the lion, the tyrant of the forests, the despot of the animal king- dom. He proves to be his friend, pulling a sharp thorn out of his paw. "Truly the child in his transfiguration looked like a powerful victor, the lion not like the de- feated one, because his strength remained hidden within him, but like the tamed one, entrusted to his own powerful will."225 So Goethe describes his Daniel with the lion, hinting at the religious meaning of this myth by the words: "Faith and hope are fulfilled; love, revealed in prayer, is miraculously active." Love and wisdom are united in this Daniel with the simplicity of a child's heart. If the ironical Goethe saw the strength even of Christ's love and wisdom fail before man's resistance, the affirma- tive Goethe shows this Daniel succeeding in his act of reconciliation. Pure human- ity brings higher powers into the play of life. Though Goethe did not care "through which door you entered the city of God,"226 reconciliation-the lasting aim of his constructive religion-may be fur- thered by a basic but simple faculty in- herent in man. As the text underlying his religious convictions, Goethe once desig- nated "John's Gospel: Little children, love one another."227 It is the wisdom of a child with which Wilhelm Meister, in Makarie's house, exclaims: "Great thoughts and a pure heart, this it is that we should beg from God."228 UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 225 Novelle (JA, Vol. XVI). 22s West-6stlicher Divan, "Buch der Betrachtungen" (JA, V, 37): "Frage nicht, durch welche Pforte Du in Gottes Stadt gekommen." 227 To Zelter, November 7, 1816. Goethe added: "Und wenn das nicht gehen will: Lasst wenigstens einander gelten." Cf. to Carlyle, January 1, 1828. 228 Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre, I, 10 (JA, XIX, 136). After the completion of this essay some writings became accessible which are related to our subject. Among them W. Flitner's book deserves particular recognition for the analysis of the work of the old Goethe as a comprehensive expression of his ethical and religious views (n. 204). He also re-examined the religious development of the young Goethe. Grete Schaeder dealt with Goethe's religious thought in her comprehensive work, Gott und Welt: Drei Kapitel Goethescher Weltanschauung (Hameln: Seifert, 1947). Although leaning toward Protestant orthodoxy, she left far behind the radicalism of Luetgert by the depth and the refinement of her interpretation. Paul Hankamer took issue with our problem in his beauti- ful and penetrating study, Das Spiel der Maechte (Ttibingen: Wunderlich, 1943). Dealing with Goethe's life and work during the years 1807 to 1812, he in- vestigated Goethe's concept of the demonic and his attitude toward it. He characterized impressively Goethe's intention as that of building images of order and right against the ever threatening chaos and ex- plained Goethe's distance from orthodoxy as the result of his aversion to the religious insanity "which over- comes men once in a while in modern times, so that they have to push humanity into the dust" (p. 333). The religious significance of Goethe's studies in na- ture is presented by Ernst Michel in Goethes Natur- anschauung im Lichte seines Sch6pfungsglaubens (Wies- baden: Dieterich, 1946). To conclude from his address, Unsere Zukunft und Goethe (Ztirich: Artemis, 1948), Karl Jaspers has not noticed the decisive changes in reading and interpretation which the research in Goethe has brought about during the last two decades. Eduard Spranger has published a collection of his studies of Goethe's philosophic thought: Goethes Weltanschauung (Inselverlag, 1946).</page></plain_text>
