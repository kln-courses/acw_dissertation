ABSTRACT Phase I, Phase II, Caterpillar, Allis-Chalmers, Clark, Hyster, Toyota, and Entwistle fork lift upset studies have been conducted with Hybrid II dummies, Side Impact Dummies, and stunt men. The investigations concluded that the dummy lacks the ability to brace itself, hold on, and does not have adequate biofidelity to represent the human in a fork lift upset. Crushing injuries and death typically occur when the operator is thrown or jumps from the overturning forklift and is pinned by the overhead guard or canopy. The dummy studies demonstrated a wide range of Head Injury Criteria (HIC) values that were not reproducible. Furthermore, other injury producing variables such as angular acceleration, angular velocity or induced brain stress were not investigated. The injury level of 1 000 for the HIC for the mid-sized male, small female, and 6 year-old has been recommended by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). The fork lift studies showed that HIC values were typically lower when the dummy stayed within the fork lift. Stunt- man experiments demonstrated that humans can brace themselves and hold on to prevent ejection and injury if they are lap-belted and have either a winged seat or hip restraint. The winged seat and lap belt was adopted by Clark in 1983 and the lap belt and hip restraints by Hyster in 1986 even though field acceptance levels were low. BACKGROUND A sharp rise of industrial fork lift related accidents occurred in the 1960s. California, for example, saw a 400% increase in fork lift injuries while total lost time injuries over the same time period increased only 150% [DLSR 70]. Accidents involving fork lifts tended to be more severe as exemplified by data collected in North Carolina: 18.8% of the injuries involving material handling equipment resulted in over 25% of the fatalities. [NCDL 77]. Fork lift upset appeared to be a particularly hazardous type of accident. Of 132 fatalities recorded in California that occurred with the fork lift in motion, 66 or 50% were due to overturning and running off the road [CDIR 82]. A study in Wisconsin concluded that fork lift overturn accidents were "severe all out of proportion to their numbers" [MCPE 76]. Reviews of accident details of these fatal accidents have an often repeated script: "The vehicle overturned and the worker jumped or was thrown out. The operator was pinned to the ground by the vehicle canopy and died as a result of his injuries" [DSLR 70] [CDIR 77] [NCDL 77] [MCCA 82], Further studies of accident data showed similar results. Hart found 18.4% of industrial truck accidents involved truck upset. He also found that 54.4% of the time the operator was injured [HART 76]. Overturn was listed in the top ten fork lift truck accidents [LOVE 77]. The particular concern of fork lift safety had been apparent elsewhere. In 1965 the U. S. Navy publication, Safety Review presented a fork lift overturn article where the operator was crushed by the overhead guard [SAFE 65]. In 1968, Safety Review printed an article suggesting that fork lift drivers should wear seat belts [SAFE 68]. SEAT BELTS Seat belts have a long history of use to prevent ejection and subsequent injury to operators. Seat belts were used as early as 1885 on horse-drawn vehicles. In 1949 factory installed seat belts were offered by Nash and by 1968, FMVSS 208 took effect requiring seatbelts in all forward facing seat positions. [SAE 85]. By the 1960s, the use of occupant restraint had been a recognized attribute of safe equipment design [WOOD 64], By the early 1970s, seat belts for fork lifts had been under discussion and it was noted that a Swedish company recommended seat belts to protect operators from striking the overhead guard [ASTL 71] Nevertheless, there was much opposition to operator restraints on fork lifts. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) first chose to be neutral regarding the installation of seat belts [ITA 65], In April 1968, the ITA referred the subject to its General Engineering Committee (GEC) [ITA 68a]. By the following July the ITA Subcommittee IV recommended to the General Engineering Committee that the ITA take a position against the use of seat belts 61</page><page sequence="2">[ITA 68b]. In November 1969, the subcommittee reaffirmed its position against seat belts and recommended no further consideration [ITA 69]. About this time, the State of California was considering requiring safety belts on all industrial trucks with an overhead guard. The ITA quickly objected to the required use of seat belts but could not locate any reports verifying that non-use of seat belts averted any driver injury [ITA 71a]. The ITA issued a call to attend the public hearings and defeat the requirement. [ITA 71b]. At the public hearings held in Los Angeles, the ITA testified that seat belts are "not a safety measure at all and instead of contributing to safe operation of industrial trucks, they are themselves a hazard." [SOC 71a pg 4:15]. When asked for any statistical or record evidence to support the contention that safety belts are a hazard, the ITA could produce none [SOC 71 a, pg 7:3-6]. The ITA based its position mainly on the fork lift's low speed and requirement to go backwards [SOC 71a, pg 7:24]. Among the individuals that testified was a man who had experienced a fork lift overturn. In his words: "I held on to the steering wheel and fell with the fork lift. For some reason, the fork lift fell very slow and this gave me time to brace myself - result, no injury" [SOC 71a, pg 15:24- 16:1]. The proposed safety rules were approved but without the seat belt requirement [SOC 71b]. There was activity at the Federal level as well. Hyster Company objected to the seat belt requirement proposed for 30 CFR 77.403 (1972). Hyster felt that seat belts would encourage operators to remain with the fork lift rather than jumping free. Hyster recognized that there was an absence of any statistics that show injury was avoided by allowing the operator to move clear [HYST 72]. In early 1977, the ITA was pressed to reassess its position against seat belts. The General Engineering Committee of the ITA had found that the California Industry Advisory Meeting recommended seat belts or a fabric mesh retainer. Furthermore, the ITA's own confidential survey revealed that 75% of the operators in fork lift over turn accidents sustain injury and 1/3 of the injuries are from the over head guard. As a result, the ITA dropped its opposition to seat belts [ITA 77]. In 1978, the ITA Lawyers' Committee recommended to the ITA Board of Directors that the General Engineering Committee study the use and efficacy of seat belts and other operator restraints [ITA 78]. In February 1979, the ITA Subcommittee X met and discussed operator restraints. Ten experts representing major manufacturers of industrial trucks concluded that fork lifts with over head protection installed should also be equipped with operator restraints [ITA 79a]. At the June 1979 meeting, the subcommittee discussed conducting operator restraint tests where Dr. Albert King would determine the effect of the overturn on a dummy. [ITA 79b]. In August, the Operator's Restraint Task Group voted to retain Dr. King and conduct tests "to determine how well seat belts restrain the operator (dummy) in case of lateral and longitudinal overturning. This led to the Phase I Tests. PHASE I TESTS In 1980, King performed 36 over turn tests with and without seat belts [KING 81]. Using a remotely steered fork lift, he conducted dynamic overturn tests at 9 - 1 1 mph. During these tests, the dummy had a distinct tendency to be ejected from the fork lift. King claimed that the ejections were an interesting phenomena, not common in the field, and of limited importance. King surmised that the dummy's kinematics in these tests were an unrealistic simulation of actual human response due to the lack of voluntary reaction on behalf of the dummy to resist the over turn forces. In all three of the ejections, which were deemed "premature," the legs of the dummy were entrapped by the overturned lift truck. None of the tests was able to duplicate the interaction of the dummy head with the overhead guard, as was the intent of the study. King did however clearly show that the dummy that stayed within the confines of the operator cab was exposed to significantly lower risk of injury as judged by the Head Injury Criteria (HIC) value in addition to elimination of the possibility of being trapped by the fork lift and crushed. An analysis of King's data shows no statistical difference of HIC value for the cases where the dummy stayed in the fork lift. If the dummy was ejected, the HIC was significantly higher.

King did not employ nor contemplate the need for upper body support in this test series.

King performed a single off-dock test and stated that the data may contain unrealistic spikes that may have exceeded the dynamic range of the data acquisition system. PHASE II TESTS The ITA sought an independent testing laboratory for additional tests and contracted with the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute (UM-HSRI). The Phase II tests were completed in 1982. [MELV 82], Twenty-one dynamic lateral overturns were conducted using dummies with various unrestrained, armrest, and seatbelt configurations. These authors also grappled with the difficulty of tying the dummy into the lift truck in order to make a more human-like response. They found that a sharp turn of the fork lift resulted in the rearward ejection of the dummy, whereas a "mild" turn resulted in a premature ejection of the dummy before the fork lift had overturned. In two of the tests, they were successful in trapping the dummy by the overhead guard. The Phase II tests were generally comparable to the Phase I study as shown in the following table: Phase II Mean HIC Std Dev Operator Restrained, partial ejection 791 769 Operator Unrestrained, remained in vehicle 405 1 69 Operator Unrestrained, ejected **1492 1367 "Significant at 0.05 level from Phase I study Again, the data from these tests confirm the result that an operator is exposed to significantly less risk of injury if he remains within the vehicle. The data reported also had substantial variability as evidenced by the magnitude of the standard deviations. There were 10 static dock related over turn tests. The lateral overturn data consisting of four tests, showed no statistical difference for the belted and unbelted cases at the 0.05 level. Mean HIC Std Dev HIC Values Lateral overturn unbelted 3694 4947 196,7192 Lateral overturn belted 6089 287 5886, 6292 Neither of the lateral tests utilized arm rests, wing seats, or upper body restraint. After reviewing the data, the authors stated that the test procedures were still unrepeatable, and, consequently, no definitive conclusions could be reached about the efficacy of the various restraint systems tested. CLARK STUDY In 1983, Clark Equipment Co. conducted an extensive study of tip over accidents involving counterbalance fork lifts [CLAR 83]. The objective was to determine what could be done to minimize injury in this type of accident. Research identified the following alternatives for operator protection: 1 . Cab with side doors 2. Surround bar and ratchet 3. Gull wing doors with mesh 4. Gull wing doors with no mesh 5. Seat bar restraint 6. Folding net screen 7. Lap belt 8. Wing back with belt 9. Lap belt and side bar; 10. Lap belt and shoulder harness 1 1 . Sliding net/screen The original study indicated high partiality to enclosures in that five of the top six safeguards were enclosures. Discussions with survivors, combined with some computer models of the dynamics of tip over, confirmed that the duration of time during tip over (about 3 seconds) gives the operator an opportunity to begin egress from the truck, but not enough time to clear the overhead guard or upright before the vehicle strikes the ground. Of the 1 1 proposed safety devices, five were identified as having the greatest potential to satisfy the company's objective: 1 . Gull wing doors; 2. Lap belt; 63</page><page sequence="4">3. Lap belt with shoulder harness; 4. Winged chair plus lap belt; 5. Winged chair plus armrest bar. Fifty four tests were reported to evaluate the effectiveness of these safeguards. Key findings: • Lap belts. In 16 tests, the dummy used in tip over simulations struck its head against the ground. • Gull wing doors (no belt). Eleven tests were conducted with the dummy in the enclosure but not restrained to the seat. These tests revealed a high incidence of head injury. Unless the doors were used with a seat belt, the operator would likely experience serious injury. • Gull wing doors (with lap belt). Clark conducted eight tests of this configuration. Although doors plus belts provided adequate protection, this safeguard was not selected because: 1 .The doors would provide the operator with a false sense of security; 2.The top of the over-head guard would require padding; 3. If the seat belt were not worn, serious injury would likely occur. • Four-point harness with retractors. Only one test was conducted with this device. It was felt the harness would be too restrictive and would present additional concerns (i.e., the effective locking of the seat belt). • A winged (shoulder bolsters) seat with armrests and lap bar. Eight tests of this device found that the lap-type restraint was not as secure as a lap belt. • Winged seat with lap belt. Eight tests indicated a high level of operator survival in the event of tip over. Based on these results and due to the initial employee complaints that gull wing doors caused a claustrophobic reaction and discouraged seat belt usage, Clark selected this safeguard. The Clark experiments used a crash simulator to evaluate the effectiveness of the different safeguards. In these tests, a plywood impacting surface was used. Since the characteristics of plywood are significantly different from concrete or asphalt, the results are not directly comparable with other studies. The results did confirm that the HIC value associated with belted occupants is highly variable even under the controlled conditions of a simulator as indicated by the standard deviation of the obtained values. The use of the wing seat led to more consistent data as indicated by the standard deviation. Mean HIC Std Dev All belted trials 268 356 Wing seat plus belt 99 12 A professional Stuntman was hired to simulate actual tip over situations using a lift truck equipped with the new safeguard. The operator was helmeted but no witness marks were found that would indicate head contact. Subsequently, Clark offered this concept to the rest of the industry and retrofitted thousands of its own trucks at no charge [BUSI 83] [MODE 83]. As a result, most fork lift seats are now equipped with protrusions (i.e., bolsters and wings) at shoulder level as well as raised bars at the bottom of the seat (configurations may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer). CATERPILLAR STUDY In 1985, Alem conducted a series of tests sponsored by the Caterpillar Company [ALEM 85]. The tests sought to compare the traditional seat without restraints to the winged seat/belt combination advanced by Clark. The tests used an overturn simulator with a steel impact surface. Alem sought to model self-restraint by the use of a special device that applied a constant level side restraint force of 125 lb. Alem used film data collected from the Phase II studies to arrive at roll rates of 115 an 160 degrees per second representing the lower and upper limits of observed "slam down" of the fork lift. Alem used a side impact dummy and obtained three repetitions for each experimental condition as summarized by the following table. Low Speed test High Speed test Mean HIC| ŠĎ" Mean HIC ļ ŠD~ Standard Seat No belt 0 0 31 30 Wing Seat with belt 2417 889* 6406 2153 64</page><page sequence="5">In contrast to previous findings, Alem found little to no potential for injury for the unrestrained operator and an extraordinarily high potential for injury when the winged seat and belt system was used. Alem did not attempt to assess defensive actions that an operator could take such as tilting against the tip over direction and bracing against the floor and seat although he did recognize the importance and the variability of such action. An indication of the importance of human operator response was indicated by a test that was run with 1 75 lb of self-restraint force. The HIC was reduced to less than 25% to 600 from 241 7 in the low speed test. The authors unfortunately did not follow up on this important finding. ALLIS-CHALMERS REPORTS In 1985 and 1986 a series of reports for Allis-Chalmers Industrial Truck Division were prepared by Triodyne, Inc. and the Institute for Advanced Safety Studies (affiliated with Triodyne) regarding fork lift overturns. The first report [ALLI 85a], related eight anecdotes of field accidents. Of the 6 lateral tip overs reported, there were 4 cases of no injury, one minor injury and one fatality. Three operators climbed out the opposite side of the tip, one "jumped clear" and one stood up in the opening of the overhead guard. In the one fatality, the operator was trapped beneath the overhead guard. The report suggested that the actual number of tip over accidents significantly exceeded the number reported. The second report [ALLI 85b] employed 38 operators in a variety of visibility and driving maneuvers to evaluate the effect of the Clark winged seat and seatbelt on driver operation. The eight experienced fork lift drivers never voluntarily used the seatbelt. The experienced operators had a reduction in head rotation of 2.1 to 5.8 degrees when using the winged seat and seat belt. The authors concluded that this loss of view is expected to significantly reduce the overall safety of the fork lift truck operation. The third report [Allis-Chalmers 27 Dec 85] examined the acceptance of seat belts by experienced operators. Eleven fork lift trucks were equipped with seatbelts and hour-meters that recorded the number of hours of belt usage. There was very little acceptance of seatbelts by either operators or management. The common reasons given for not using seat belts were (1) frequency of getting on and off the truck, (2) unsafe on docks or flatbeds, and (3) general dislike of seatbelts. The fourth report [ALLI 86b] related 44 dynamic overturns that were conducted using various standard and winged seat / seat belt systems and an uninstrumented dummy. Some of their conclusions were • The dummy's head always struck the ground regardless of the restraint system (contrast with Alem's results) • Properly tightened seatbelts prevented crushing from the overhead guard. • The standard seat without seatbelt frequently resulted in the dummy impacting or being crushed by the overhead guard • The unbelted dummy in a winged seat was protected from being crushed between the ground and overhead guard. The fifth report [ALLI 86b] presented data from 56 lateral overturn tests. The study specifically did not attempt to model any defensive action that the fork lift operator might pursue during an overturn. Utilizing a second fork lift, the test fork lift was upset with the dummy in the operator's seat. Some over turns were accomplished, however, by tying a chain to the overhead guard and using a heavy duty station wagon to jerk the fork lift over to the floor resulting in a much higher rotational velocity during the overturn. The tests on which this technique was used were not revealed in the report. The study attempted to compare the standard seat with the winged seat both with and without seat belts. The tests showed no difference between the standard seat (with or without seat belts), and the wing seat without seat belts; the wing seat with seat belts showed a higher mean HIC value of 2331. By not modeling self-restraint as other authors were doing, they ignored an important aspect of injury investigation. The results of these tests did not confirm other studies that were being conducted with actual fork lifts, nor did they confirm tests conducted with human volunteers. HYSTER STUDY Hyster Company conducted tests from 1983 to 1986 evaluating lateral overturn protection [JOHN 86]. They found that operators lean uphill with a gripping force of approximately 200 pounds on the steering wheel in an impending overturn. In fact, they reported, it was difficult for the volunteers not to resist the overturn. In their words: "Human volunteers in controlled static tip over tests determined human response and subjective reactions to tip over conditions. The natural reaction was to hold firmly to the steering wheel and lean away from the point of impact. A properly installed seat belt is effective in controlling forces on the lower torso by keeping the operator in the seat, and gives a feeling of security. If seating can be maintained most operators have adequate arm strength to control inertia forces on the upper torso at truck impact, and the so-called "flyswatter" effect is manageable. Volunteers in tip over tests unanimously preferred to wear seat belts. 65</page><page sequence="6">The Hyster study noted that available test dummies did not duplicate human response during lateral over turns. To address this short coming, they modified the dummy with respect to positioning, hand grip, and upper body resistance. The upper body resistance was modeled by two devices: a shoulder spring mechanism and an air cylinder mechanism instead of a simple tether. The spring mechanism was evaluated because the human reaction at truck impact appeared resilient or spring-like. Using the spring arrangement, the Hyster hip restraint seat versus the Clark wing seat was studied both with and without seat belts in dynamic overturns. The tests showed no difference between the Hyster seat and the Clark seat when seat belts were used. The Hyster seat without seat belts resulted in the lowest HIC and an intermediate value was obtained for the Clark seat without seat belts. Hyster (Hip) Seat Clark (Wing) Seat No Seat Beit With Seat Belt No Seat Belt With Seat Belt Mean HIC **68 150.5 **103 152" Std Dev īiT 22Ā 6Ā 27^6" ** Significant at 0.05 level Static over turn tests using the spring shoulder restraint compared the hip restraint seat with and without seat belts. The results showed no difference in resulting HIC values at the 0.05 level of significance: Hip Restraint Seat No Seat Belt With Seat Belt Mean HIC 670 453~ Std Dev 3ÕÕ" 267 It was decided that the extension spring did not duplicate human response as well as expected. In contrast to a spring in which force varies with distance, the human can provide a significant level or resistance throughout the time and distance he resists. Consequently, a constant pressure air cylinder was evaluated. The response of the test dummy with the air cylinder shoulder force system was considered a good model of human resistance in a fork lift over turn. The dynamic tests resulted in HIC values comparable to the unbelted spring restraint tests. The average HIC was 111.75. The standard deviation of the results was 105.7 indicating substantial variability in results. The static over turn tests using the air cylinder restraint (without seat belts) resulted in uniformly low average HIC values of 13.0 (standard deviation 1.0). The Hyster report also addressed off-dock accidents by conducting 6 drive off dock tests and 5 trailer pull away tests. In their words they concluded: Tests were done to evaluate the Operator Restraint System in tipovers at loading docks. Off-dock tipovers are severe, and proper safety practices should be strictly followed to prevent the truck from falling off the dock. The operator's area remained intact throughout the dock related tests. If the operator remains with the truck by wearing a seat belt, the potential of avoiding serious injury appears to be good relative to other choices. Certain local hazards, such as operations near bodies of water, may require different action. Field acceptance of seat belts was estimated to be about 20%. After exhaustive human volunteer and dummy testing, Hyster selected a seat with hip restraints and a lap belt with retractor for their operator restraint system. In 1991, Hyster field data [WELC 91] found that in vehicles where the restraint system installed, the seat belt was used in 10 percent of reported over turns. Significantly, belted operators sustained no serious injuries. TOYOTA STUDY In 1986 Toyota conducted a study to develop a fork lift seating system that would reduce the overall frequency of serious injury to operators in the event of fork lift overturn (TOYO 86]. The study considered the dynamics of turn over, the actions that a human operator could take, and the forces involved through the use of anthropomorphic dummies. Volunteers were also studied as to their actions during a roll over event in a simulator box. The time of a fork lift tip over is relatively long because of slow running speed and it is usually a single vehicle accident. And, it was recognized that there is generally enough time for the operator to detect the danger and take some kind of defensive action as evidenced by cases where the operators tried to escape from the fork lift truck but could not get out quickly enough or were thrown away from operator compartment and became trapped between the ground and the frame. Other defensive actions possible for the operator are to cling 66</page><page sequence="7">tightly to the steering wheel or another component, or jump out of the driver's seat. Depending on the operator's reaction during tip over, it was cautioned, any device installed to protect the operator, might, instead, harm the operator. It was found out that when a fork lift is about to tip over, the driver unconsciously tries to tilt his body to the opposite side of the inclination of the simulator driver's box with both hands held on to the steering wheel tightly and with both legs wide open to press against the box floor while the simulator driver's box was tilting. Volunteers without seat belts received larger inertial forces when the tip-over plate was stopped at the 45- degree position. The volunteers could hold onto the steering wheel but their hips slid off the seat completely and both hands were supporting the whole weight of the driver with significant force. Another consistent response was that the driver's head leaned toward the opposite side of the titling. On the other hand, when the driver wore a seat belt, the sliding of the hip could be prevented. The sliding force of the hip was supported by the seat belt and the supporting force on the steering wheel for the upper body could be sharply reduced. Thus, it was found that human volunteers could take necessary measures to brace against the impact with ease if the seat belt was used. With a belt, the maximum load on the steering shaft was found to be approximately 100 lbs. The Toyota team was satisfied fastening both hands of the dummy to the steering wheel, tightening each joint of the dummy to approximated the human response, and applying rubber straps to the right side of the body. The Hybrid II dummy was used for testing although it was recognized that there is no dummy ideally suited for this type of testing. Automotive crash test dummies such as the Hybrid II or side-impact dummies are accepted primarily for testing where human muscular strength is not significant factors. During operation in relatively slow speed, or during a slow tip over, the operator's resistance is generated which a dummy cannot simulate. Based on the measured values for volunteers of different weights, it was estimated that a person the size of an American male 50th percentile dummy would hold on to the steering wheel with the force of approximately 70 lbs. This value was used for the test dummy whose weight was 1 65 lbs. The Toyota team developed a seat with side restraints that were higher than the Hyster hip restraint seat but lower than the Clark wing seat. The Toyota waist restraint seat with seat belt supported the test dummy while the vehicle was tipping over. The containment of the upper part of dummy inside the vehicle was deemed good, and, as a result, the dummy's head did not strike the ground directly. The Toyota study reported the mean HIC for waist restraint with seat belt as 47.4 with a standard deviation of 2.5. ENTWISTLE STUDY In 1992, Entwistle undertook a study using human subjects to evaluate operator reaction during a forklift overturn using the standard seat, hip restraint seat, and wing seat. Using untrained volunteers in an overturn simulator and a controlled 90x rotation, he found all volunteers able to maintain themselves in the operator's seat by bracing their feet against the floor and pushing rearward into the seat while grasping the steering wheel. Lateral loads on the steering column were typically about 100 lb. Using the simulator in a free-fall mode with a stunt man, Entwistle found the wing seat had the lowest head velocity. Lateral shear load of the steering column was about 100 lb. Steering column shear loads for the standard and hip restraint seats, by comparison, were 150 to 200 lb. Entwistle concluded that simply bracing and hanging on is a viable way to stay within the operator compartment during static overturns. The seat belt, however, provides the best containment because it prevents the operator from attempting to jump free during an over turn. Finally, the wing seat offered the best protection against entrapment under the overhead guard. OPERATOR SELF-RESTRAINT From the earliest tests, it was apparent that operator self- restraint was an important factor in preventing or mitigating injury during fork lift overturns. Operator self- restraint was at first modeled by a chest restraint and by tying the dummy's hands or wrists to the steering wheel. In the Caterpillar study, Alem measured lateral self- restraint at shoulder level and obtained an average of 1 18 lb for two volunteers of average physical build. Damon measured forces on an aircraft control wheel for 33 Air Force men in 1971 [DAMO 71]. It was found that the subjects could exert average forces of 196 lb pull and 265 lb push on the wheel. Damon pointed out the general magnitude of variability between people with regard to strength. In a group of young, healthy college men of various builds, strength varied tenfold, with the 95th percentile 4 to 5 times stronger than the 5th. During pulling or pushing against the control wheel, the forces are applied along the general direction of the arm muscles, whereas in rotating the wheel, the forces are applied in a direction perpendicular to the arm. Such lateral motion brings into action the same muscle groups that may be involved in lateral self-restraint action of the truck operator. The reported level of about 100 lbs represents, therefore an estimate of such self-restraint 67 forces.</page><page sequence="8">QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR HEAD INJURY PREDICTION Because of the shortcoming of HIC, a means of accurately predicting head or brain injury in a subject is still actively under study [ALBS 99]. Sanees has given a review of the various theories of skull fracture and human head injury tolerance. [SANC 86][SANC 96]. Since the agents directly responsible for brain injury (e. g. pressure, force, stress, inertial movement) are difficult to measure, a surrogate was sought. It was apparent that peak acceleration and impulse-area measurements, although they are related to head injury are not easily related to experimental data. Energy absorption calculations were found difficult to apply and there did not appear to be any simple relationship between energy absorption and brain injury. In 1966 Gadd proposed a severity index, SI based upon the Wayne State Tolerance Curve (WSTC) [GADD 66]: SI = J a" dt where a = acceleration response function . n = weighting factor, generally 2.5 ms t = time duration In 1971, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) was proposed by Versace [VERS 71]. The HIC attempted to incorporate the observation that a higher peak acceleration was tolerable if presented in a shorter period of time. HIC = f (~Z~) h/ f a(t) dil (t* ~ tl) s ^000' L'^2 h/ Ji i JmtKňnttm where a in the expression is the resultant acceleration, and t-i and f2 are any two points in the acceleration curve that maximize the equation. Versace emphasized that the WSTC represented only the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable levels and that it did not provide a scaling for injury. In 1984, Mertz again emphasized that injury assessment values should only be used to interpret the response of dummies and thereafter only as a guide to design [MERT 84]. Nevertheless, a graph relating HIC to percent population expected to experience life threatening brain injury was advanced. The basis for the curve was a series of 54 cadaver impacts [PRAS 85a]. The result of the impact was scored on the presence or absence of a skull fracture. By using the lowest HIC for which a fracture was observed (450), the highest HIC resulting in a non-fracture (2351), a normal curve was generated between the two. (The log- normal model was later shown to provide a better fit by Hertz [HERT 93].) The appearance of a skull fracture was equated to lite-threatening brain injury. Kleinberger reviewed the literature on head injury and the origin of HIC for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration [KLEI 98]. The recently improved data fit to skull fracture head drop tests is shown below: 1.0 r 0.8 Î 0 6 i / - 0.4 / / CL / 0.2 / o.o I- - 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 HIC 36 Injury risk curve for the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). A review of the recent Head Injury Criterion for child and adult dummies is given by Sanees [SANC 99]. The value of HIC &lt;= 1000 for an integration duration of up to 36 ms is recommended in the Federal Motor Vehicle Standards (FMVSS) Standard 208 for the mid-sized male (50% Hybrid lll).The value of 1000 has been adopted for the mid-sized male, small female, and 6 year-old child. This decision was made after reviewing a large number of test data available in the NHTSA data bases [KLEI 98]. It has been noted "the presence or absence of a skull fracture does not have much significance on the course of brain injury" [PRAS 85b]. The validity of HIC as a predictor of brain injury continues to be questioned [NEWM 98]. The typical criticisms of HIC in this role are 1. HIC attempts to ascribe the entire collision event to the level of severity between two times, ti and t2. HIC does not consider acceleration out side this region, i. e., t &lt; ti and t &gt; t2. 2. HIC does not refer to rotational dynamics which are known to cause severe head injury. 3. The short duration part of the WSTC upon which HIC is based consists of approximately 6 data points. Further, for the WSTC data points, HIC was not calculated. [PRAS 85a]. 4. The correlation between the observed injuries and translational acceleration must be presumed a priori [PRAS 85a], The HIC is useful in setting standards and for comparing relative effectiveness of different methods of head protection to differing levels of translational acceleration and the occurrence of skull fracture. HIC does not measure the presence or absence of other injury mechanisms such as rotational acceleration, internal pressure, differential movement of tissue within the brain leading to shearing or tearing of tissue. To say, for example, that a HIC of 2000 will result in twice the injury severity (or any other factor) has not been established. 68</page><page sequence="9">FALLS AGAINST HARD SURFACES The experimental evidence of Prasad [PRAS 85a] shows that a HIC as low as 450 can cause skull fracture and that a HIC as high as 2351 can be withstood without skull fracture. The question of the survivability of a fall from a fork lift seat height of 6 feet (or 1 0 feet for dock related incidents) may be addressed by observing the results of documented accidental falls onto hard surfaces. The variability of humans to the effects of falls onto unyielding surfaces has been investigated by Snyder in 1977 [SNYD 77]. Falls from low heights can be fatal but falls from significant heights are not necessarily so. For example, in case 59, a 21 -year-old male survived an 11- foot, head first fall onto a concrete floor. In case 19, a 59- year-old man survived an 11 -foot fall head first onto a concrete floor. Other cases were described including those that involved infants and toddlers who survived falls from surprising heights with complete recovery, e. g. case 29, 1 year old child fell 18 ft to an asphalt drive way, case 31 involving a 21 foot fall by a 5 year old to an asphalt tile over concrete surface, and case 37 involving a 21 foot fall to concrete by a 5 year old. EXPERIENCE WITH OPERATOR RESTRAINTS In the 1980s, the Industrial Truck Assn. (ITA) agreed to add a warning label on lift trucks that stated, "Tip over can occur if the truck is improperly operated. Injury or death could result. In case of tip over, do not jump, hold on tight, brace feet, lean away from point of impact." In 1992, Entwisle summarized the Field Experience with the Clark Equipment Company restraint system [ENTW 92b]. He reviewed 51 accidents involving Clark lift trucks during the 1984 to 1992 time period. "No serious injuries were noted when belts were worn by operators. There is no evidence of head injury associated with seatbelt usage when the Clark restraint is in place. "Staying within the operator's position is more likely to result in avoidance of injury. Exiting the truck is more likely to result in serious or fatal injury. "One fatal injury was noted of 21 instances where operators remained in operating position. This injury occurred in a machine in which the wing seat and overhead guard had been removed and the truck went off a dock. "Operators continue to exit the truck during overturns and off the dock events in spite of warnings and instructions to the contrary. Of 28 events, 12 escaped serious injury, and 16 were seriously injured; of the 16, 9 were fatal injuries." The ASME Safety Standard for Low Lift and High Lift Trucks [ASME 93] states: "An active operator protection device or system; when provided, shall be used". DISCUSSION Although much experimental data has been accumulated regarding fork lift over turn safety, little direct comparison may be made due to differences in fork lifts, simulator configurations, and impact surfaces. Even for a given experimental set up, data were usually highly variable from trial to trial indicating that perhaps not all of the significant parameters were under control. A consistent finding of the experimental protocols that utilized an actual fork lift was that the operator is exposed to significantly lower risk of injury (as evaluated by HIC) by staying within the confines of the fork lift vehicle. This was shown by both the Phase I tests and the Phase II tests. The data are generally marked by high variability with the standard deviation the same order of magnitude as the mean for each test. The Clark studies were performed in pursuit of developing a workable operator restraint system for fork lifts. Tests using the Clark over turn simulator showed similar variability in tests using belted operators. In contrast, using the Clark wing seat resulted in significantly less variability. The wing seat limits the operator movement during an over turn suggesting that operator posture or position may be connected with the highly variable HIC values obtained in previous studies. The Caterpillar study compared the standard seat with the Clark wing seat in a series of tests on the Caterpillar overturn simulator. These tests, showed the standard seat without seat belts superior to the Clark wing seat. The tests modeled operator restraint with 125 lbs of force obtained through an air cylinder device. Increasing the restraint to 175 lb led to a surprising reduction in HIC. Although the authors did not follow up on this finding, it suggests that operator self-restraint may be a significant factor in operator protection. The Allis-Chalmers over turn tests also tested the standard seat against the Clark wing seat. These tests specifically did not use any operator restraints and obtained results similar to the Caterpillar tests. The Hyster studies were performed in development of the Hyster safety seat. The investigators evaluated different methods of modeling operator restraint during an overturn. When a spring shoulder restraint was used, the results were similar to the Caterpillar and Allis-Chalmers studies. Use of an air cylinder restraint system (without seat belts) resulted in a uniformly low HIC with small variability. The Hyster team noted that posturing had a significant effect on the impact sustained by the test dummy. The Hyster team also studied the HIC computation and noted that at times very high HIC values were calculated even though acceleration was minimal. These high HIC 69</page><page sequence="10">values resulted for combining multiple peaks separated by lengthy time intervals. The Hyster team did not feel HIC values computed under these circumstances were meaningful when assessing the potential for injury. The Toyota study closely investigated operator self- restraint. With waist restraints and an operator force of 70 lb, they reported a low HIC value with low variability similar to the Hyster study. Entwistle studied self-restraint using live subjects and found that 100 to 200 lb force was exerted by the subjects. The results of this study confirmed the Clark, Hyster, and Toyota studies and found the so-called flyswatter effect manageable by a human volunteer. The differences of neck dynamics between dummies and cadavers has noted in roll over studies [MOFF 97]. The Hybrid III test dummy was noted to have a much stiffer neck than the cadaver hence, in the fork lift over turn context, suggests that it can amplify the fly-swatter effect. Some studies have shown an obvious difference in the response of the head-neck system and seriously questioned the use of the dummies for side-impact testing [MELV 85]. Sanees has shown that the Hybrid III dummy neck is much stiffer than the human neck [SANC 98]. CONCLUSION 1 . The 36 overturns in the Phase I studies by King in 1980 demonstrated ejections in the absence of human muscle reaction and large variations in HIC values. Ejections gave the higher HIC values. 2. The Phase II, University if Michigan studies were similar to thoise of King. Large variations in HIC were observed in dock overturn tests. 3. Clark studied doors, gull-wings , nets, side bars , various belts and used a simulator and stunt man. They concluded that the wing seat plus lap belt was the best choice for safety and offered to retrofit their trucks with these seats at no charge in 1983. 4. Allison-Chalmers studies did not include self-restraint methods. They concluded that there was a difference between the wing seat with seat belts and the standard seat. 5. Hyster found operators lean uphill with a steering wheel gripping force of about 200 lbs during an overturn. The dummies were fitted with shoulder springs and hand grip systems. After exhaustive tests with dummies and volunteers from 1983 to 1986 they adopted a seat with hip restraints and a lap belt. 6. Toyota conducted tests and found the operator unconsciously tries to tilt his body to the opposite side of the inclination during over turns. Without a seat belt the volunteer's hips slid off of the seat. With a belt, the subject's lower body remained on the seat and he could hold onto the steering wheel with about 1 00 lbs to support the upper body. 7. In 1992, Entwistle found in human studies that operators were able to brace their feet against the floor and push rearward into the seat while grasping the steering wheel. The steering column loads were about 1 00 lbs. He found the lap belt provides the best containment and prevents the operator from attempting to jump. The wing seat gave protection against entrapment by the overhead guard. 8. Even though HIC is based on skull fracture, the NHTSA and Federal Vehicle Safety Standards suggest a value of 1 000 or less for HIC as a guide to prevent head injury. Recent studies by Hertz show skull fracture versus HIC relationships. It is well known that skull fracture alone cannot predict brain injury. Furthermore, the human head drop tests showed skull fractures with HIC varying from 450 to 2351 . Snyder [SNYD 77] has shown that a vertical drop up to 11 ft can be survived. Further, investigators did not evaluate other potential brain injury modalities such as angular acceleration, angular velocity, and brain stress. Although accidents involving fork lift operators are comparatively rare, there is a high incidence of severe injury and mortality associated with accidents that involve tip overs. The comparatively small size of a fork lift belies its weight. In the evolution of a tip over incident, the operator may be tempted to jump free in an effort to avoid injury. Since the time sequence lasts somewhat longer than one second there is often time for the operator initiate but not time enough to complete an escape. The operator would be expected to sustain fewer (if any) or a survivable injury by remaining in the protective structure of the fork lift. The use of HIC as metric to assess survivability is yet to be established for fork lift over turns. It is extremely variable and not reproducible. Operator restraints such as the wing seat, in addition to discouraging the operator to attempt to jump, help reduce the variability of operator position and thus lead to a more controlled fall. The best strategy for surviving a fork lift overturn is likely to be that of the survivor who testified at the public hearings in 1971: hold on to the steering wheel, brace yourself, and fall with the fork lift [SOC 71a, pg 15:24-16:1]. The ASME Safety Standard states that the active operator protection device shall be used when provided [ASME 93]. 70</page><page sequence="11">REFERENCES 1.
