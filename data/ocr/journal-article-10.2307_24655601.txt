<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Gudrun Bühnemann, Püjä. A Study in Smärta Ritual. (Publications of the De Nobili Research Library, Vol. xv). Vienna: Institute for Indology, 1988. 253 pp., 66 ills, (mainly photographs). Gudrun Bühnemann, The Worship of Mahäganapati According to the Nityotsava. Wichtrach: Institut für Indologie, 1988. xl, 156 pp., 40 photographs and drawings. These two books by Mrs. Bühnemann happened to be published in the same year, although "Püjä" was written earlier than 11 Worship". Both are useful and interesting additions to the existing literature on Hindu ritualism. They have been composed according to the same general pattern: an introduction describing general aspects of the relevant sections of the ritual (much bigger and more general in character in "Püjä"), followed by edition and commented translation of parts of a ritual treatise. They also complement each other in so far as they describe respectively a Veda oriented and a Tantric form of worship. The study of ritual procedures and, to a somewhat lesser degree, of ritual literature should (it will be evident) preferably be carried out by investigators who have been present at ritual sessions (if still existing) and are personally acquainted with performers. Mrs. Bühnemann (henceforth: B.) answers these requirements. Besides, she has a good knowledge of Sanskrit language and literature. Research for "Püjä" was conducted in Maharashtra (mainly Pune) in 1983—85, and the study is primarily — and wisely — focused on that region. The first part of this book is a general survey of literature and practice of the worship of Hindu gods (General Remarks, p. 29—100). After a short discussion of the term püjä, there is a good survey of the various kinds of textual sources (normative and descriptive), including a total survey of contents of the Püjäprakäsa section of the Viramitrodaya (p. 37—42), which goes far beyond the treatment by Kane (Hist, of Dharmasästra, I, p. 943). After this section, the utensils of worship and the idols are discussed (p. 43—54), followed by such subjects as the right time, preparations, services, mantras, atonements, aims, mental worship.

Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">288 REVIEWS The second part of "Püjä" (p. 101—182) is an edition and translation of the standard type of daily worship of the Rgveda Smärta Brahmans of Maharashtra. Tne term Smärta here implies the performance of pancäya tanapüjä (p. 49f.), i.e. worship of the five deities Siva, Visnu, Devi, Sürya and Ganapati. It may be called remarkable, that the Püjäprakäsa mentioned above presupposes the worship of god Brahman instead of Ganapati (p. 37). But, as noted by Kane (I, p. 953), its author Mitramisra worked at the court of Orccha near Jhansi, and not in Maharashtra. — As a textual base for this daily worship, the author makes use of the Rgvedïyabrahmakarma samuccaya (henceforth: RBKS), "a contemporarily used manual of wide circulation" ("Pw/a", p. 10). Aspects of occasional püjä are then treated in Part III (p. 183—228) from other prayoga texts. Within this last section, there is a useful survey of the most important ritual functions currently observed in Maharashtra (p. 185—190). The author's familiarity with practical ritual matters results several times in interesting information, for instance about kunkuma- (p. 156; 158n.): in current practice not exactly "saffron"; about rarigavalli (" Worship", p. 47, n. 27); or about the worship of Satyanäräyana in Maharashtra ("Püjä", p. 207f.). B.'s descriptions are generally concise, but carried through with due attention to detail. She is a keen bibliographer and her references are appropriate in general. A few times, the reader might have wished for a succinct exposition instead of the case being closed by a mere reference to some authority; in other places, the note seems unnecessary. The problem of idol worship or idolatry discussed in "Püjä", note 133 on p. 53 belongs more to the field of missiology than to that of Indology; the whole problem seems to have been created by Christian missionaries and even Hacker's views on this matter should — with due respect — not be presented as decisive. Recent developments of püjä ritual are not regularly treated in the main body of "Püjä", but there is an exposition on "Modern trends" (p. 93—100). Besides, the Appendix contains a great number of most helpful photographs and designs (beautiful are 3A and 3B: symbols of the five deities, and 38: symbols of the Rsis and Arundhati). The bibliography (p. 13—26) lists many primary and secondary sources; a reference to H. Brunner's important study of Somasambhupaddhati is lacking (3 vols., Pondicherry 1963— 1977). The same work should have been mentioned in n. 36 on p. 35, where for information on the literature of Saiva Püjä the reader finds only a reference to Gonda's Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit. In the main text, there are a few references to "Dave" who is not mentioned on the expected place in the Bibliography, but only s.v. Parasurämakalpasütra</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 289 (edition revised by Dave; see also p. 8). For Derret, read Derrett; for Diel, Diehl (p. 21); for Hooykas, Hooykaas (p. 7). As has been said, the RBKS is the textual base for B.'s description of the daily püjä of sixteen services. The exact source is the püjä section of this voluminous compendium in a recent (Pune 1979) réédition by G. S. Sendye. B. has scrupulously reedited the relevant parts of this text, dividing them into small sections and proposing a small emendation here and there. In n. 3 on p. 101, she mentions an earlier (sixth) edition (Bombay 1936) referred to by P. V. Kane, which probably was not accessible to her. This must be the same edition which could be used by the present reviewer (although published by the Nirnayasägar Press, not the Venkatesvar Press mentioned by Kane). According to its final colophon, this sixth edition was prepared by Pandit V. S. Pansikar, who also gives the dates of the earlier editions; the first was published in Saka 1818 = 1896—97 A.D. If this date is correct, the "Brahmakarma" studied by Bourquin can hardly have been an early edition of the RBKS in the present form, as surmised by B., p. 101, and we are left in the dark as to the origin of the RBKS. On Bourquin, see "Püjä", p. 8; his translation of parts of the Dharmasindhu should have been added to the entry of that title in the Bibliography (p. 15). Usually, the Sanskrit text of the RBKS is identical in the two editions used by B. and by myself. Differences are: kämadam (6th ed., fol. 21b, 1.4) for kämikam ("Püjä", p. 157, 1. 12); a small deviation in "Püjä", p. 167, 1. 8—10, resulting in a presumably better text; and the prescription of seven mantras in the cadre of the mantrapuspänjali in B.'s version (p. 175), while the 1936 ed. (fol. 22b) requires only three mantras. On p. 199, 1. 9, B.'s text does not note that the Une is spoken by the invited and worshipped Brahmin; the 6th edition has the additional word brähmanah. The accompanying mantras given in the RBKS are of two kinds: Rgvedic and "Pauränic" (p. 169). The Pauränic mantras rather resemble each other: they describe the offerings in a poetic diction and tend to theorize about the meaning of these ritual items. Although several of them also occur in other manuals, a great number may have been composed by one and the same ritual teacher (or by a compact school or tradition). The Rgvedic mantras are also edited by B., but without accentuation (for technical reasons). The translation of these mantras has been literally taken from Griffith's metrical rendering (as we are informed by B. on p. 102). It is perhaps understandable that a non-specialist have recourse to such a procedure; but the reader should at least have been warned that Griffith's translation is antiquated and very often gives wrong interpretations, for instance on p. 121 (RV 10, 63, 3: dyaur aditir etc.). Happily, B. does not</page><page sequence="4">290 REVIEWS slavishly reprint Griffith in all cases: on p. 141, n. 122, she rightly disagrees with his rendering of äj'ya, idhma and havis. The translations of Pauränic verses sometimes give reason for some deliberation. On p. 127, there is a sequence of half-slokas which serve to invoke the deities of the utensils of worship. B.'s division of the passage is controversial. In my view the first three half-slokas belong together, denoting deities which reside in different parts of the kalasa. The fourth and fifth lines then describe the presence of the Vedas in general terms (dandas as in B.'s edition): Rgvedo 'tha Yajurvedah Sämavedo hy Atharvanah II arigais ca sahitäh sarve kalasam tu samäsritah / "The RV and the YV, the SV and the AV, together with their subdisciplines all have their seat in the vessel". The next two lines (6 and 7) then invoke a few goddesses: atra Gäyatri Sävitri Säntipustikari tathä // äyäntu devapüjärtham duritaksayakärakäh / "Here (in the vessel), the Gâyatri, the Sävitri (or: the Gäyatri Sâvitri?) and She-Who-Creates-Security-and-Welfare (but see below) should arrive for the sake of divine worship, destroying evil". Then comes the famous stanza Gange ca Yamune caiva ..., invoking the Seven Rivers into the water of the vessel. In B.'s treatment of this cluster, the lines three to five are taken together, while six and seven appear more or less as independent units: "in it is the Gäyatri [verse] with Savitr [as its deity] which gives peace and prosperity. May these who destroy evil come for the püjä of the gods" (additions by B.). B. therefore in these two lines recognizes only one subject, the Gäyatri, who obtains two epithets, "having Savitr as its deity" (but G. herself is a deity in this context), and "giving peace and prosperity". But then, how to account for the plural äyäntul In fact, Gäyatri and Sävitri are not always identified, but sometimes juxtaposed, e.g. in the Vaikhänasa Ätmasükta, vs. 8 (ed. T. Goudriaan, Indo-IrJn. 12, 1970, p. 8); and in Stuti &amp; Stava . . . of Balinese brahman priests, ed. T. Goudriaan/C. Hooykaas, Amsterdam 1971, p. 424 (vs. 6). In both cases, "Sävitri Gäyatri" was interpreted by myself as referring to the same deity, but I am not so sure now. In the present stanza in any case, S. and G. can have been distin guished as two related "sisterly" powers, presiding over separate aspects of (or: connected with) the same powerful Vedic stanza, RV 3, 62, 10. A Süryä Sävitri is also known as the seer of RV 10, 85 (Süryä hymn) according to Brhaddevatâ 2, 84 (ed. and trsl. Macdonell, p. 55). In Tantric</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 291 literature, G. and S. appear as the presiding goddesses of resp. the letters o and au (e.g., Kubjikämatatantra 17, 108 and 24, 21). Cf. also H. Brunner, Les Membres de Siva, in: As. Studien/Et. Asiatiques, 40, 1986, p. 117, n. 100 (two additional Angas of a Tantric mantra). Returning to the stanza quoted above, we note that there should be more than two subjects because the verb is in the plural. This suggests that also Säntipustikari is a separate deity with specialized function.. We can even go a step further, and analyze the compound name into Sänti[h] (= Säntikari) and Pustikari (perhaps variant of Pusti). This is actually the reading of the RBKS in both editions (B.'s note 83 and my own observation), and B.'s emendation seems quite unnecessary. Éânti and pusti are distinguished in the Rgvidhäna as the two main objectives of ritual activity; while desires and deities are closely associated in the next two stanzas of that remarkable text. Cf. also the title of Mäyä Mâlavïyâ's study: Atharvavedïya Säntipustikarmäni, Varanasi 1967 (Sarasvatï Bhavana Studies, xvii), and p. 2 of that work. It would seem therefore that we can recognize four deities in the present stanza, who admittedly go by pairs: Gäyatri, Sävitri, Sänti and Pusti(kari), who in concerted action should destroy all evil. The meditation stanza on Sürya given on p. 134 in a series of five devoted to the Pancäyatana must originally have been directed to Visnu as the "Man in the Sun": Sasankhacakram ravimandale sthitam kusesayäkräntam anantam acyutam / etc.; compare a stanza on Visnu in Rgvidhäna 3, 42, 1 and other collections: Dhyeyah sadä savitrmandalamadhyavartï Näräyanah sarasijäsanasannivistah / etc. From the same verse it follows that kusesayäkräntam is not "encircled by a water-lily" but "standing upon a water-lily". On p. 179, we find the line ägatä sukhasampattih punyäc ca tava darsanät-, B. translates "plenty of happiness has come by merit and by your sight". I doubt whether this is meant because a reference to one's own merit during prayer would not befit the devotee. Rather: "and the fulfilment of happiness has come by your auspicious sight"; the word ca, although relegated to the fourth quarter, seems to connect and contrast the whole hemistich with the preceding one which expressed the disappearance of evil. The stanza raktämbhodhistha- (p. 195), describing the Pränasakti, also occurs in Devibhägavata-puräna (ed. R. T. Pandey, Käsi Samvat 2016) as 11, 8, 19, with a few deviations. The six-armed goddess stands on a lotus</page><page sequence="6">292 REVIEWS which rests upon the "red ocean" (B.; or: "ocean of blood"?) and is characterized by six enchanting and fear-inspiring attributes, viz. noose and elephant-hook, Kama's bow and arrows, rosary and skull-cup filled with blood. Her sixfold nature is suggestive of the six dhätus or material components of the body, she herself being in that case the female companion of the Ätman or Jïva as seventh or basic Dhätu (pradhänadhätu, Kubjikâmatatantra 23, 140A). In the Kubjikämata (23, 130f.), a ritual is described during which an adept draws a red mandala and worships the six goddesses of the Dhätus on the points of a hexagon, while a central goddess called Kusumini is adored as the Ätman's partner. This scene seems to be rather far removed from the representation favored by the RBKS; but we might note in any case that a goddess with the same form and attributes as the Pränasakti, but sitting on a lotus of the colour of the sun (which rests) on a boat in the red ocean etc., is described under the name Ambikä in the Tantrasära by Krsnânanda (p. 96). Among the occasional püjäs described by B. in Part III figures the worship of Satyanäräyana as noted above. From the stories which have been included, it does not come to my mind that this god is "very jealous" (B. on p. 201, n. 64; perhaps from Kane, H. Dh. V, p. 437). These kathäs rather have a standard structure: neglect or ignorance of the god's worship; the god reveals himself and warns or instructs; the devotees do as has been told and obtain the results of the vrata or püjä. Although B. (p. 206) in the context of the story of the merchant rightly refers to the episode of Sunahsepa in the Aitareyabrähmana, she does not stress the important role played by Varuna in this vrata (p. 208) and in the püjä text (p. 210: in the areca fruit; trsl. p. 212) as a central deity surrounded by the Lokapälas including himself as the deity of the West! One is tempted to conclude that Satyanäräyana as the guardian of truth has consciously been introduced as the Vaisnava "real nature" of Varuna who was allowed to maintain his leading position in the very conservative ritual domain. The Rsipancamïvrata discussed by B. on p. 213f. has to do with the monthly "impurity" of women and is nowadays performed after menopause as a general präyascitta. As a textual source for this ceremony, B. selected the Särthapüjäsamgraha (on p. 218, 1. 14, read SPS for SDS), because the rite "is not included in the R(V)BKS". But it is, only not in the püjä section utilized by B., but in its third section called Vratodyäpanädimisraprakarana "Mixed section containing (the rituals of) concluding a Vrata etc.". The relevant text occurs in the 6th edition on fol. 248a, 1.4 up to the end of 248b. The first part (the Samkalpa) runs rather parallel to the text given by B. (a difference: rajahsamparkajanitadosa- instead of samparkajanitadosa</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 293 in B.'s text). The püjä stanzas for the seven sages and Arundhati are then taken from the Rgvedasamhitä as indicated by B. on p. 220, n. 117 as an alternative. The concluding stanza runs in the RBKS: Eté saptarsayah sarve bhaktya sampüjitä mayä / mama päpam vyapohantu jnänato 'jnänatah krtam // After a prayer for forgiveness, the devotee is exhorted to spend the night (waking) listening to kathäs etc. On the next day, he should have a homa performed and offer daksinäs to the brahmans in the manner as described by B. on p. 217. The third vrata treated by B. ("Püjä", p. 22If.), the Anantacaturdasi, is also an interesting aspect of practical Hinduism. The ceremony has been succinctly described by P. V. Kane (V, p. 151—53, not referred to by B.). Kane, writing in any case before 1958, notes that the number of persons who perform this vrata "are rapidly diminishing". B., probably more than 30 years later, notes that the rite is performed "by many" (and presents the fine photograph no. 41 as proof). Has there been a revival, or was Kane too pessimistic? — Ananta/Sesa is the central deity of this vrata. As is well known, this figure has a close relationship to Balaräma who is so to say its human counterpart (situation described by B. on p. 224); the supposed identity is critically considered in a recent article by Yu. G. Kokova, Obraz Balaramy v epose i Puranach, in: G. A. Zograf, red., Literatura i kul'tura drevnej i srednevekovoj Indii, Moskva 1987, pp. 88—95, esp. p. 90. On the other hand, as B. remarks, Ananta "the Eternal One" is also a name of Visnu himself. One might also note the symbolic relation of Ananta and Kala, the ever-recurring Time, who is the fear-inspiring aspect of Krsna himself in the eleventh chapter of the BhGitä. Kane (p. 152) notes the identity Ananta-Käla, referring to Hemädri. The name Ananta might then secondarily refer to the conquering of time and decay by the devotee who, like Sesa, identifies with the Lord; while Mesa's fearful counterpart, the demonic Käliya who was subdued (not killed) by Krsna, might be explained as Time/Death who holds the untransformed self in its grip. Both are said to have lived in or near the banks of the Yamunä, who is worshipped with Ananta/Sesa in this very ritual. Also of this vrata, the text occurs in the RBKS (Section III, fol. 253f.); B. again takes it from the SPS. The Samkalpa in RBKS resembles the one from Varsakriyâkaumudï noted by B. (p. 224, n. 135). On some points, the RBKS is more informative. Thus, it enumerates the fourteen deities of the knots of the string which play a central role in this ritual, besides several other gods. There is another characteristic difference. Above the image of</page><page sequence="8">294 REVIEWS Sesa made of darbha grass, the worshipper should according to the RBKS place Ananta in the form of a golden string of 14 knots and, above him, (the anthropomorphic) Anantadeva holding plough and club. This god can hardly be different from Balaräma, but his female partner is Laksmï! The stanza of the binding of the string given by B. on p. 228 can be interpreted differently: ananta samsäramahäsamudramagnam . . . . B.: "Ananta, lift [me] up who am sunk in the great ocean of samsära . . This might be a current reinterpretation, but the original intention will have been that one should read (with Kane, o.e., p. 152) anantasamsâra-, cf. again the Rgvidhäna, 3, 33, 4ab samsärasägaram ghoram anantam klesabhäjanam. Instead of Kane's translation "save (people) sunk in the great and endless ocean of samsära . .I propose: "save (me, with B.) who am submerged in the great ocean of unending samsära . . The prayer in the next hemistich: anantarùpe viniyojayasva "connect me with Ananta's form" lends support to the assumption that Anantadeva can represent the reoriented self which has escaped Time by becoming eternal in its own right. The other book by B., " Worship", describes the worship of Mahäganapati, a ten-armed form of Ganesa popular in Maharashtra. Her basic source is one of the most important Tantric ritual monographs, the Nityotsava (Nity.) by Umänanda, who flourished about the middle of the eighteenth century. As far as I know, this is the first time that the Nity. is the subject of an independent monograph. Umänanda was a disciple of the famous Bhäskararäya who may be considered the most important Tantric theoretician of the last few centuries. The Introduction (p. xv—xxxv) deals with questions regarding Umänanda, the deity, and the general charac teristics of this type of worship, for which see also B.'s article Tantric Worship of Ganesa according to the Prapahcasära, in: ZDMG 137, 1987, p. 357—382. On p. xxxvi—xxxviii, there is a concordance of translated passages from the Nity., compared to the Parasurämakalpasütra (PKS) on which the Nity. relies heavily. References to the PKS abound therefore in the book, although a general evaluation of Umänanda's treatment of this work is lacking. After the Introduction, B. presents the relevant text of the second chapter of the Nity., which describes the worship of Mahäganapati. A number code is added for easy reference. There are also several insertions from the third chapter devoted to Sri (i.e. the Tantric goddess of the Srividyä) whose worship is described in the Nity. with more elaboration. The reader thus obtains a better idea of the real course of the ritual. This extended text comprises 30 pages, including the repetitious litanies which</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS 295 are not abridged by B. in text or translation (the effect can be rather tiring). The Sanskrit text has been almost literally taken over from the Baroda edition by A. Mahadeva Sastri, revised by Swami Trivikrama (4th impr., 1977). Even the very frequent omission of sandhi, a characteristic of this edition, has been respected, for example trih arghyadänam (p. 3); -mantroksite äsane (p. 9). But: nama iti (p. 9) is written even at the end of a mantra where the sandhi could better not have been applied. The result is a somewhat clumsy-looking text, although the edition is done carefully in other respects. On p. 27, 1. 20, no mention is made of the (justified) emendation of gajänanä- to 'gajänanä- (perhaps already done in the 4th impression; I could consult only the third impression of 1948). The translation (p. 37—98) can most profitably be read together with the Commentary (p. 101—129), which is rather a systematic paraphrase of the course of the ritual. There are a bibliography (p. 137—142), a verse index, a good general index (to the entry "principal mantra" on p. 151, add the page numbers 41 and 105), and forty very helpful photographs and drawings. The explanatory notes to the photographs are, however, at the other end of the book. The bibliography does not refer to the Ganesagïtâ, edited with Nllakantha's commentary by H. N. Apte, Poona 1906 (Än. Skt. Ser., Vol. 52), trsl. Kiyoshi Yoroi, The Hague 1968 (Ph.D. Thesis Utrecht Univ.). The book adequately serves the purpose of providing a better access to this particular form of worship which it describes accurately enough. As in "Püjä", there is much attention to details, especially to ritual gestures, each of which is carefully described; there are also photographs of them. On the other hand, the aim has not primarily been to reflect on the ritual's "essence" or "deep structure" which would be a difficult thing to do indeed. The uninitiated reader is thus sometimes confronted with bare descriptions or allusions the deeper meaning of which must escape him. Among these is the invocation of secondary deities the circumstances of whose incorpora tion in rituals are still largely unknown. On p. 47, Bhadrakäli and Bhairava are invoked in the right and left (from the deity's view: left and right) parts of the door. For Bhadrakäli, B. gives a reference in n. 28 to T. A. Gopinath Rao's standard work Elements of Hindu Iconography, which appeared in 1914—16. We might want to understand why this goddess here appears as a deity of the door. Reference to her fearful nature which is apt to keep demons etc. outside would only partly answer the question. Perhaps there is a connection with the myth of the destruction of Daksa's sacrifice by VTrabhadra (= Bhairava?) as whose female associate Bhadrakäli appears at VäyuPur. 30, 140 in an admittedly rather confused description. Also</page><page sequence="10">296 REVIEWS according to Kulärnava T. 10, 51, Bhadrakäli is Vïrabhadra's wife. In Bhaktapur (Nepal), during the Bisket Jatra, BhadrakâlFs festive cart ritually collides with that of (Äkäsa)bhairava (E. Chalier Visuvalingam, Bhairava: Kotwal of Benares, p. 10; in: V. P. Verma, ed., Varanasi Through the Ages, Benares Hindu Univ. 1986, referring to J. F. Vézies, Les fêtes magiques du Nepal, Paris 1981). The appearance of this redoubtable pair as door-deities testifies to their "taming" by a higher god and their employment in his service. — In the lintel of the same door, Lambodara resides who could better not outrightly be identified with Ganapati (B., n. 29), but rather characterized as a partial manifestation which hypostatizes one of that god's characteristics. On p. 49 of " Worship", a kind of obstacle called bhedävabhäsaka- is ritually removed. For these vighnas, B. (n. 40) refers to PKS 8, 8 where the variant bhedävabhäsinah occurs. This does not help us much, because there is no further explanation in the PKS or its commentary by Rämesvara. B. translates bhedävabhäsakän vighnän utsärayet (Nity. text, p. 9) with "he should expel the obstacles which distinctly appear ... (to belong to the earth etc.)". This must be wrong. As the original meaning I suggest: ". . . the obstacles which cause (the wrong idea of) difference (between self and deity) to appear". Reference could be made to PKS 3, 14: apasarpantu . . . ye bhütä vighnakartärah . . . iti tälatrayam dattvä devyahambhävayuktah "saying: 'those Bhütas who create obstacles should run away . .he should thrice clap his hands, being conscious of his identity with the Goddess". Here, Rämesvara is not silent: aham upäsya devyabhinna iti bhävayitvä, making use of the root bhid- to express the negation of this identity. The term bhedävabhäsa, by the way, occurs in Abhinavagupta's Tanträloka (9, 150) as the essence of God's Mäyä being a "differential reflection". — On p. 56, n. 65, for the eight deities of speech, reference is made to the PKS and another text. They occur also in the Nity. itself on p. 75, 1—9 (3rd ed.). For B.'s translations, alternatives might be suggested here and there, but these usually concern small details or a slight improvement of the English. A more poetical diction might have been chosen on p. 87 (from a statement of rewards in the last stanza of a Ganapatistotra), where the passage tasya srïr atulä svasiddhisahitä srisäradä säradä syätäm tatparicärike has been rendered by: "he will indeed have as his attendants incomparable wealth (and) the sacred learning that gives strength . .A translation like "The incomparable Goddess of Wealth ... and the venerable Goddess of Learning Who offers strength, will be his attendants" would have been more</page><page sequence="11">REVIEWS 297 respectful to these divine ladies and more delightful to the devotee; but one may think otherwise. In translating mantras, one should be very careful with changes of sequence. On p. 56 of " Worship", "srim gim svähä to the index fingers and to the head" renders s.g. tarjanïsirase svähä. It would be preferable to maintain svähä, which is supposed to accompany the actual offering, at the end of the utterance (cf. "Püjä", p. 193). A second question here is whether we would not do better to translate: "... to the index fingers/the head" or ". .. to the head (embodied in) the index fingers", because of the singular -sirase; but the mantric grammar is often aberrant. — p. 70, 1. 22 svägrädiprädaksinyena "clockwise from his point", better "clockwise from (the point which lies) in front of himself". — p. 96, 1. 7f. In the stanza translated here, Sivädyavaniparyantam refers to the 36 Tattvas, Brahmädi stambasamyutam to living beings; and Kälägnyädisiväntam to worlds, not "from the fire at the end of the world . . ." (B.), but "from (the lowest sphere called) the Fire of Destruction . .The same expression is often found in Ägamic texts, see e.g. Somasambhupaddhati on initiation, 5, 2; ed. H. Brunner, Vol. iii, Pondicherri 1977, p. 453. In this connection the question might be raised whether it would not be desirable to try to translate some of the proper names of secondary divinities, in order to render their meaning accessible to non-Sanskritists who might be expected to consult the book (for instance, historians of religion or anthropologists). In " Worship", interesting names such as Tivrä etc. (p. 70; nine Saktis of Mahäganapati) or Dharma etc. (p. 71) are left untranslated and without comment. — In the expression brahmädistambasamyutam, -stamba- has surprisingly been translated as 'small insect', with ref. to a commentary. I could not find this meaning in the dictionaries. The usual meaning is 'tuft of grass', or related concepts, even in the expression stambagh(a)na-, cf. Amara 3, 2, 35 and the commentary quoted in Sabdakalpadruma V, p. 432: trnädyunmülana kärikhaniträdih. The synonym trna- is also found in SivaPur, Bareli ed., p. 640, vs. 19a brahmäditrnaparyantam. An apt translation is "having veiled" for avagunthya (" Worship", p. 62), although B.'s reference to Rämesvara's onesided comment on this term (comm. on PKS 2, 5, ed. A. Mahadeva Sastri, 1923 impression, p. 89) calls for a little precision. Essentially, avagunthana as a ritual act has a protective function generally associated with the Anga called Kavaca "Armour". Cf. Mrgendrägama, Kriyäpäda, 6, 26 varmaraksitam, comm. kavacenävakunthi tam (variant kunth- for gunth-), and other places in the same text, see H. Brunner's translation, Pondicherri 1985, Index, sub Varma. As the commentator Bhatta Näräyanakantha remarks on MrgÄgKr 3, 10, all the</page><page sequence="12">298 REVIEWS six Arïgas were originally conceived as protective in nature (cf. the previously mentioned article by Brunner, Les Membres de Siva, p. 107). Protection by Kavaca suggests a purely defensive concealment of the body (in contradistinction to protection by Astra). This is why the function of the Armour is also often paraphrased by the term ävarana or other formations from ä-vr- "to envelope, conceal", an activity which is generally ascribed to Mäyä(sakti), for instance in Paramärthasära 15, quoted by Rämesvara on PKS 1,5. The same activity is sometimes called äcchädana "covering" (Rämesvara, I.e.; Netratantra 21, 16); i.e. the pure reality of the self is concealed from those who are without insight. Rämesvara's explanation of kavacenävakunthya (PKS 2, 5, as noted above) is therefore not wholly adequate: anyatragamanasaktirahitam krtvä "having deprived (the deity) of its power to go somewhere else". Instead, B. could have referred to Trcabhâskara 3, 4, 14 quoted by herself in "Worship", p. 118, n. 47: avagunthanam ayogyadrstyavisayatväpädanam "veiling is ensuring that (the deity) is not the object of improper looks" (trsl. B.); we are reminded of the seclusion of the Achaemenidian (also of Indian?) kings during their meals. The author has done a good job by attacking these at first sight unattractive ritual manuals. On closer inspection they open up interesting vistas on important aspects of Hindu religiosity; and despite a few imperfections here and there, these two books, without giving the final picture, serve as reliable guides which can profitably be consulted by anyone who wishes to acquaint himself with the subject. It is to be hoped that Mrs Bühnemann will be enabled to continue her research in this field. Utrecht TEUN GOUDRIAAN</page></plain_text>
