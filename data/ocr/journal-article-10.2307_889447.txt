<plain_text><page sequence="1">New York Modern sculpture In autumn and winter 2001 there was a great deal of important modern sculpture on view in New York's galleries and muse- ums. At P.S.1 five new works of art from Richard Deacon's Infinity series (to 31stJan- uary) were on display. He designed the outdoor galleries, and so not surprisingly his sculptures, sited in front of the entrance of P.S. 1 on the sloping gravel path, form a handsome introduction to the museum proper. Quasi-industrial forms become works of art, Deacon's stainless steel assem- blages being constructed from groups of flat units set in a plane. Set at an angle, these sloping sculptures are up-to-date versions of Henry Moore's familiar reclining figures. On the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden, The Metropolitan Museum of Art five sculptures by Joel Shapiro were shown (closed late autumn 2001), three in bronze, and two in painted aluminium, one blue, the other red. With their leg-like and arm-like rectangles, attached to a central torso, Shapiro's smaller sculptures resem- bled human figures dancing or jumping against the background of Central Park. The largest sculptures here, Untitled (2000- 01), a twelve-foot high horizontal assem- blage and Untitled (1996-99; Fig.78), a twenty-four foot vertical construction, were also the best. Unlike the smaller pieces, these big sculptures transcended the all too obvious anthropomorphic implications of too much of Shapiro's recent art. PaceWildenstein showed thirteen sculptures by John Chamberlain juxta- posed with nine paintings by Willem de Kooning (closed 27th October).1 The paint- ed steel elements of Chamberlain's assem- blages are three-dimensional equivalents for the painterly gestures of de Kooning's paintings (Fig.77). Using extraordinarily skilful juxtapositions, the exhibition drew attention to Chamberlain's use of colour and de Kooning's depiction of sculpture- like forms. Chamberlain's sculptures have never looked better - they were more lucid than when shown alone. According to an old, now certainly dated tradition, colour in sculpture is supererogatory. But Chamber- lain requires colour and without the reds, blues and other strong colours of his crushed automobile parts, it would be im- possible to read his compositions. For de Kooning, ironically, colour is not essential, for some of his strongest paintings were black and white. Chamberlain shows that the tradition of action painting, no longer viable for painters, remains important for sculpture. Because sculpture is a three-dimensional art, it depends, more so than painting, upon an effective setting. Displaying these Dea- cons and Shapiros in gardens, and the jux- taposition of the Chamberlains and the de Koonings, heavily influences how they are seen. The placing of Deacon's sculptures on the ground against the concrete walls of the entrance to PS. 1, emphasised their relation- 77.

Viewing Shapiro's sculptures high above the park, with the towering apartment buildings visi- ble on all sides, underlined their connexion with human figures. And observing Cham- berlain's coloured sculptures next to de Kooning's paintings pointed to their kinship with Abstract Expressionism. Unlike Deacon, Shapiro and Chamber- lain, Richard Serra creates works so massive as to be essentially self-sufficient. Six new Serras filled the enormous rooms of the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea (closed 15th December).2 Two torqued spirals, Bellamy and Sylvester, twisted around twice. As you walked in between these high twisting steel walls set at an angle, you encountered people coming out. After a long disorienting 55</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 79.

Gagosian Gallery, New York). march, you finally reached the centre, and then were ready to repeat that movement when you exited. The relation between your experience of entering these sculp- tures, your memory of their appearance from the outside, and the view you had standing at the centre, is hard to describe and altogether compelling. The effect is something like entering a traditional maze, but what gardener made labyrinths from heavy steel? Betwixt the torus and the sphere uses long curved steel panels to create five pas- sageways. After you walk through, you can re-enter on another parallel path. Also in the exhibition were Elevational wedge (Fig.79), a site-specific, inclined plane rising to the height of five inches on the floor above an exiting gallery ramp; Union of the tomrus and the sphere, in which the two sections constitute an interior which cannot be viewed or entered; and Ali-Frazier, two massive blocks, one eight inches wider than the other, set in identical rooms. But these less menacing sculptures were much less convincing than the torqued spirals or Betwixt the tomrus and the sphere. Without visible rival, Serra is the most radical, and (this is a quite distinct claim) the greatest of contemporary American sculp- tors. Over the past thirty years or so he has created a distinguished, highly innovative body of art, unapproached by anyone else of his generation. Why then does one remain ambivalent about this greatly admired figure ? Part of the problem is that leftist commentators, encouraging him to think of himself as a social protest artist, have distorted Serra's true achievement. But the real difficulty is that Serra's art is too obviously about menace, about making us feel uncomfortable when we walk in between his high leaning walls. There is something uneconomical, even unaesthetic about his dependence upon enormous forms. He fascinates and excites me, but makes me uneasy. In the original version of his essay 'The New Sculpture', published in 1948, Cle- ment Greenberg expressed the hope that the best new sculpture could become more expressive than painting. When he revised that essay in 1958, he noted that his hopes had been dashed. Painting remained the leading art. Comparing the nine sculptures in the survey exhibition Naked Since 1950 at C&amp;M Arts (closed 8th December) with the sixteen paintings on display suggests that this conclusion still remains valid.3 Donatello would have been astonished at the paintings by Dubuffet, Picasso and Roy Lichtenstein, but could immediately have 80.

C&amp;M Arts, New York). understood Charles Ray's Male mannequin (1990), Louise Bourgeois's Pregnant (2001) or Kiki Smith's astonishing Virgin (1993; Fig.80), so oddly reminiscent of his own Penitent Magdalen. Sculpture is a more con- servative art because three-dimensional works of art remain far more tied to the body than painting. The abstract sculpture of Deacon, Shapiro and even Chamberlain remains closer to figurative art than the paintings of their peers. And even Serra, I would argue, remains tied to tradition, for the expressive power of his sculpture essen- tially depends upon the movement of our bodies through his abstract constructions.
