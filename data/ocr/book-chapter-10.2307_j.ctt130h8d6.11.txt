<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 6. Influences on a changed story and  the new normal 1990s: values   and beliefs [Prince Charles] has long called on people and politicians to rethink their  attitudes to the planet, economic growth and consumption. Recently,  however, government policy has become based on the notion that problems  such as climate change are best addressed through science and technology— without compromising economic growth and consumerism. ‘Greenie Charles worries Labour’, The Australian, 11 July 2009 Environmental questions are inextricably intertwined with economic issues  and, at base, are concerned with values rather than so-called ‘scientific  facts’.  David Mercer, A question of balance—natural resources conflict issues in  Australia, 1991 To understand what happened in Australia in the 1990s, with its dramatic  change of public narrative on climate change, it helps to explore the ideas that  came with the opinion leaders who reset the narrative. This is important not  least because the same influential ideas are back in the political driver seat with  renewed vigour, having never really left since the mid-1990s. In November 2013, just before a super typhoon, packing 315-kilometre-per- hour winds, ravaged the central Philippines with many thousands dead, cities  flattened and the resulting hunger and desperation,1 former Prime Minister  John Howard told the world what he thought of climate science and the need  for evidence-based policymaking. Howard led the Liberal Party and the country  from 1996 to 2007. He was speaking at a meeting of the Global Warming Policy  Foundation (GWPF), a UK gathering of climate ‘agnostics’ and ‘sceptics’.  He is reported to have said that ‘the high tide of public support for overzealous  action on global warming has passed’ and that ‘I instinctively feel that some  of the claims are exaggerated’ while also repeating the common sceptic thesis  that climate scientists are just after public money by scaring the public about  upcoming catastrophe (Hall 2013). 1 Scientists and journalists who follow the climate change story commented that no single typhoon or  cyclone along with storm surge can be attributed to global warming and sea-level rise. However ‘scientists  do have more confidence about what’s likely to come in the decades ahead if we can’t curb global warming:  stronger tropical storms ... the typhoon’s strength could well be a sign of catastrophes to come’ (Walsh 2013).  77 </page> <page sequence="2"> Global Warming and Climate Change In the breaking news story on this event, Fairfax London correspondent Nick  Miller reported that Howard called climate change predictions ‘alarmist’ and  linked his own position to economic management and growth, particularly in  developing countries—which happens to benefit quarry Australia. Miller also  revealed that Howard admitted the only book he had read on climate change  was a 2008 tract by (Lord) Nigel Lawson, an avowed climate sceptic and GWPF  founder (Miller 2013).  The Fairfax media had a bit of editorial cartoon fun with Howard’s remarks  linking the new administration of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to Howard’s  legacy and ideas: ‘Oh Lord protect us from the zealotry of climate scientists ...’ begins one cartoon  by Wilcox in The Canberra Times of 10 November showing Howard, Abbott and  environment minister Greg Hunt piously in the church pews. The week before, Hunt declared that he would not attend the latest international  climate change talks because he needed to be at home for the first parliamentary  sitting whose top legislative agenda item was to undo the carbon price  established by the previous Labor administration. The Abbott government in  its first month in office also dismantled the country’s Climate Commission of  scientific advisers and proposed to defund a public finance corporation that lent  to renewable energy projects and which, incidentally, was profitable, according  to Hansard records.  Here was a timely reminder that Howard’s science-free beliefs guided the public  face of Australia’s policy positions on climate change for more than a decade  before he was defeated in 2007. In 2013, this set of beliefs was resurfacing  strongly. There’s plenty of evidence, as I have shown in the previous chapter, that  outside the halls of Canberra a wider campaign of confusion and doubt  supported Howard’s instincts. That campaign has continued since Howard was  in government. Look no further than 2009 in the lead-up to the ‘15th conference  of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)’  held in Copenhagen. Work by an international consortium of investigative  journalists, including in Australia members of The Sydney Morning Herald staff,  unveiled the continuing and highly funded public relations campaigns by  multinational coal, aluminium, and electricity industries and, at times, related  labour unions, to influence and deflect government action (‘The global climate  change lobby’). The lobbying story, even some of the players, were the same as  previously documented and discussed looking back at the 1990s. The tactics  were also familiar.  78 </page> <page sequence="3"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs Familiar themes invoked a mental pathway where jobs and family ‘us’ would  lose out should action on climate change involve any change from the energy  system status quo; for example, employers would go offshore if their needs for  cheap power were not met. This narrative has made the economic interests of  multinational companies synonymous with the national interest and rhetorically  with every family’s interests.  With the link between the increasing risk of extreme weather events and  global warming and climate change having been laid out time and again by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, national  academies of science and even some business sectors, such as the insurance  industry, the ongoing denial that there might be a problem begs the question:  have influential opinion-leaders behaved irrationally during the past 20-plus  years and do they continue to do so? How can they deny the risk and subvert  action faced with the overwhelming scientific evidence of outcomes that are  more evident on the ground year by year?  While many observers believe that politicians and their advisers are unable to  think past the current or next election cycle, thus being unable to respond  to a long-term issue like climate change, there is more going on. Underlying  the changed narrative are values and beliefs held by politicians and other  influential opinion leaders that make their responses internally consistent, if  not always ‘rational’ or understandable to the casual observer. These values and  ideas dominated society at large during the 1990s and 2000s and thus came to  seem ‘normal’.  Values guiding denial The denial of environmental reality, what is happening in the natural world  around a civilisation, is not a new phenomenon for the human species. Biogeographer Jared Diamond looked extensively at the collapse of previous  civilisations and says that, more often than not, it has been the values and beliefs  of societal elites more than any empirical on-ground evidence (frequently of  changing climatic conditions) that has determined the fates of these civilisations  (Diamond 2005).  The proposition that values guide much environmental policy development  and communication takes the story beyond a saga of corporate self-interest  from potential losers in energy sector reform. Instead we see that facing the  climate sciences during the 1990s and since have been deep-seated ideologies  that came to exercise a comprehensive grip on Australian society. The term  hegemony would fit the cultural consensus that prevailed in Australia post 1996.  (Italian political scientist Antonio Gramsci’s influential theory of hegemony  79 </page> <page sequence="4"> Global Warming and Climate Change postulates that in advanced industrial societies, one group or class can rule  through dominating everyday ideas and practices, and this is done through  information—for example, mass media and public relations, schooling, popular  culture, and consumerism.)  Dominant ideas and values have built on a modern ‘no limits’ view of human  capability versus the natural world. There are parallel beliefs in growth and  progress as guiding principles in the organisation of society; plus related beliefs  in the power of technology to fix all problems (a technocratic view of the world  that has gone into overdrive since the ascendance of the internet in the early  1990s, spread by the many companies that have capitalised on its opportunities).  Also tapped are older, deeply embedded beliefs in human exceptionalism from  the rest of the natural world. These unspoken beliefs are shared by opinion- makers and much of the public, and came together in the 1990s with a particular  form of free market capitalism (economic rationalism) and its related economic  assumptions. Together they reshaped the political and media responses to the  scientific messages, and came to define the dominant narrative for the general  public: what we all should believe. Pioneering beliefs and techno fix Like other ‘pioneering’ Western democracies, such as the United States and  Canada, Australia has long-standing beliefs that natural resources are there to  be exploited and developed. Australia also enjoys a recent history that seems to  prove (European) humans can always come up with a techno-fix solution. With  this world view, people can believe ecosystems, plants, animals and natural  resources, even nature itself, do not exist independently only as a store of matter  and energy waiting for human transformation. ‘The most important natural  relationship taken for granted by [this belief system] is a hierarchy in which  humans (and in particular human minds) dominate everything else’ (Dryzek  1997: 50). This is a hallmark of a secular techno-fix world view that has dominated since  World War II. While not necessarily denying that natural systems exist in their  own right, proponents of this view often subscribe to a ‘wise use’ philosophy to  argue that not to exploit the planet is ‘wasteful’ and that adverse environmental  effects are overstated by special interests such as ‘greenies’, who do not have jobs  and the national interest at heart (Beder 2000; Dryzek 1997). The corollary idea is  that humans will always find a technological solution to any environmental problem  anyway and that ‘no-limits’ development is the natural order of human endeavour.  80 </page> <page sequence="5"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs Traditional adherents to this philosophy have been the big mining and timber  production companies, farmer and pastoralist organisations, professional  engineering bodies and the like (supported by development-oriented State  and Commonwealth governments) ... and rhetorical links with ‘progress’,  ‘national interest’, ‘wealth/job creation’, ‘development’, ‘growth’, ‘defence’  and so on have frequently been made. (Mercer 1991: 41)  Monash University geographer David Mercer wrote the above from a historical  perspective in 1991. At that time, in response to greenhouse risks outlined  by scientists, a set of ethical values, based on the public interest and global  responsibility, were guiding Commonwealth and most state policies, and were  being communicated to the public. What happened in the 1990s is that a more  traditional ‘no-limits’ view of humans versus nature and the sectors listed by  Mercer appeared to reassert themselves, boosted by the economic ideas of neo- liberalism.  In Australia, regardless of the nominal differences between the major political  parties, values have been shaped across the board by the colonial and pioneering  experience based on vastly modifying the natural environment for agriculture  and later quarrying for mineral wealth. This belief that Australia’s economic and  cultural destiny is to sell natural resources and be a (well-paid) quarry for the  rest of the world sits comfortably with the ‘no limits’ and techno-fix narrative.  The problem that evolved was what to do with the conflicting idea of human- generated climate change due to burning fossil fuels when Australia became a  world-leading coal exporter and domestic use was also running at full throttle.  Denial and argument might then come naturally, accompanied by occasional  rhetoric about bringing emissions down. A wishful Australian techno-fix solution to this mental conflict has been ‘clean  coal’ or carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the coal-burning cycle. There  has been little scientific evidence that CCS will do what it is supposed to do,  but government rhetoric often proclaims otherwise. So far, the focus on clean  coal has been a matter of belief rather than evidence. Atmospheric and earth  scientists have offered no such techno-fix in any timeframe that matters to  current emission statistics.  The environmental movement itself often subscribes to a techno-fix world  view. A 2005 interview study with 25 of the top leaders of US environmental  organisations found a biological systems approach lacking in environmental  policy and concluded: Thinking of the environment as a ‘thing’ has had enormous implications  for how environmentalists conduct their politics ... (which) hasn’t  changed in 40 years. First, define a problem (e.g. global warming) as  81 </page> <page sequence="6"> Global Warming and Climate Change environmental. Second craft a technical remedy (e.g., cap and trade  [in Australia, emissions trading]). Third, sell the technical proposal ...  through a variety of tactics such as lobbying, third party allies, research  reports, advertising and public relations. (Shellenberger &amp; Nordhaus  2005: 4) These authors argue that even a reliance on individual choice for LED lightbulbs  or hybrid cars reflects this same techno-fix mindset—if only we have enough  technical solutions understood by the public, this problem will be solved. They  also identify reasons why environmentalist organisations could be as easily  marginalised as they were in Australia in the 1990s. They suggest a narrow  tactical focus and lack of effective coalitions with other societal interests (e.g.,  labour unions, or animal welfare organisations, or church groups), have not  helped. The internal ‘group think’ encourages the broader society to consider  the environment to be separate from mainstream concerns.  Progress myth and human exceptionalism:  Beliefs that trump science  In Western democracies with Western Christian values, it is telling that the  following view is hardly considered unusual. In a 2004 opinion piece, syndicated  columnist Angela Shanahan, who doesn’t hide that she is a practising Christian,  slammed those citizens who would protect Australian wildlife against lethal  state government programs. She called such people ‘extreme greenies’, with  ‘unreal’, ‘Mickey Mouse’, ‘anthropomorphic’ world views that deny there is  ‘such a thing as a hierarchy of living things’ (Shanahan 2004).  A mythology that humans are exceptional, top of the hierarchy, and not subject  to the ‘laws of nature’ governing other animals, underlies much of Western  thinking and stems from Christian teachings. Arm-in-arm with exceptionalism  is the always forward-looking, linear mythology of ‘progress’ and human  betterment. Historical philosopher Ronald Wright wrote about belief in progress  as cultural myth: ‘Myth is an arrangement of the past, whether real or imagined,  in patterns that reinforce a culture’s deepest values and aspirations ... Myths are  so fraught with meaning that we live and die by them’ (Wright 2004 4). Historian Lynn White Jr, in his ground-breaking essay ‘The historical roots  of our ecologic crisis’, which was published in Science in 1967, argues that the  fundamental religious myth of humans as exceptional is both most pervasive  and most internalised in Western culture. ‘What people do about their ecology  82 </page> <page sequence="7"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs depends on what they think about themselves in relation to the things around  them. Human ecology is deeply conditioned by beliefs about our nature and  destiny—that is, by religion’ (White 1967: 1205).2 White wrote that, in its Western form, as distinct from the more contemplative  Eastern Orthodox church, Christianity is the most anthropocentric (human- focused) religion the world has seen. It has a world view that denies the existence  of any spiritual qualities (the soul and similar concepts) in other species. From  there extends an assumed exceptionalism to the laws and needs of the natural  world that brings many people into conflict with environmental science or  ecological knowledge. ‘Christianity ... not only established a dualism of man  and nature, but also insisted that it is God’s will that man exploit nature for his  proper ends’ (White 1967: 1205). White also identifies the ‘progress myth’, saying Western (Judeo-Christian)  cultural activities are dominated by an implicit faith in perpetual progress,  which was unknown either to Greco-Roman antiquity or to the Orient. In fact,  Marxism, which is superficially anti-religious, is provocatively called a Judeo- Christian heresy in this analysis, due to its beliefs, along with capitalism, in  the guiding myth of perpetual progress. Forty years ago, when environmental  studies were starting in earnest, White predicted that ecological crises will  worsen as long as people, including many scientists, retain these unexamined  basic assumptions and myths.  It’s easy to overlook that Western science and technology were born from the  desire to understand God’s works and that, when this desire merged with the  Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, it allowed ever greater exploitation  of natural resources—believed to have been put there by God for man’s benefit.  Science historian and physicist Spencer Weart, while giving a detailed account  of the scientific discovery of global warming, concludes that beliefs, including  religious beliefs, will guide future climate change because they guide how  we deal with our environment in an age when humans are altering planetary  systems (Weart 2004). There is an intellectual kinship between Christian beliefs in the exceptional  nature of humans on the planet and the more secular progress, ‘no limits’, views  of human activity and impact. Armed with these various beliefs of limitless  possibility, it may seem rational to dismiss a precautionary, risk-management  response to scientific assessment of climate change—and to the population  growth that implicitly drives more greenhouse gas emissions. Leading agenda- 2 White wrote in 1967, in the context of human impact on the planet, ‘our present combustion of fossil fuels  threatens to change the chemistry of the globe’s atmosphere as a whole with consequences which we are only  beginning to guess’ (White 1967: 1203). Another piece of evidence for the general knowledge about climate  change that existed decades ago. 83 </page> <page sequence="8"> Global Warming and Climate Change setters in politics, the media, and business can appear to believe (demonstrated  by what they say and do) that what is happening to the natural world will  not affect human culture. For similar reasoning, such beliefs could encourage  a person to deny or dispute that there are global warming impacts and links to  extreme weather events.  The websites of organisations like the Lavoisier Group, or the environmental  arm of the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA), and other free market Australian  think tanks reveal such contrarian thinking. In a revealing 2004 article on the  activities of the anti-climate science Lavoisier Group, The Age journalist Melissa  Fyfe characterised those at a meeting of 50 men (only one woman) in Melbourne  as follows: ‘Some of them were scientists. But many were engineers and retired  captains of industry. Presiding was Hugh Morgan, president of the Business  Council of Australia and former Western Mining boss. The master of ceremonies  was retired Labor politician Peter Walsh’ (Fyfe 2004: 1). To the extent that ‘no  limits’ beliefs and values seem natural to these institutions and professions,  their opposition to accepting climate change science is more understandable. Ecological limits: Understood since the 1960s  and accepted until the late 1980s Opposing the ‘no limits’ view is a belief in ecological limits and limits to  the carrying capacity of the planet, and indeed the realisation and scientific  evidence (including DNA analysis) that humans are one among many evolved  species and, in many ways, not so exceptional. This understanding was well developed during the first wave of global  environmentalism starting in the 1960s. The understanding of limits was  popularised by the global think tank Club of Rome reports in the 1970s and the  works of biologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich, and Lester Brown of the Worldwatch  Institute, and many biological and other scientists in the past 30–40 years. The  understanding of limits still informed the climate change narrative in the late  1980s, as the documentary evidence shows. E.O. Wilson, Harvard ecologist and a leading theorist on the interaction of  humans with the natural world, has observed that human beliefs about our  prospects on the planet now fall into two categories: human exceptionalism  and environmentalism. Environmentalism here defines humans as a biological  species tightly dependent on the natural world, compared to feeling freed  from the biophysical constraints of the planet by transcendent intelligence and  84 </page> <page sequence="9"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs technological prowess. Humans’ conflicted views on their own skyrocketing  population numbers is a related example of exceptionalist thinking (Wilson  2005). Wilson noted that the short-termism that marks not only politicians, but also  the species in general when faced with anything other than self, family, or tribe,  may have had an evolutionary advantage over the two million years that modern  humans evolved, where life was mostly precarious, short and unpredictable.  Evolutionary biologists have noted that modern humans bring a Palaeolithic  hardwire to runaway technical success.  It can be argued that the late 1980s upsurge in multinational, energy-intensive  industries, such as aluminium and mining in Australia, encouraged a strong  return to the traditional, no-limits and exceptional way of viewing humans versus  the natural environment and Australia versus the rest of the world. Certainly  the mental gymnastics involved with promoting all-out coal production while  giving lip service to climate change action would indicate that the thinking has  been ‘rising emissions will not affect us’. These beliefs merged smoothly with  a defining economic system that gathered steam and reached its height in the  1990s led by a new breed of economist. Rise of the economists and fall of the public  sector The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are  right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly  understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who  believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence,  are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority,  who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic  scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests  is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.  (John Maynard Keynes, 1936: 383) In the last 20 years, the public record indicates that beliefs in the wisdom of  technology and underlying exceptionalism values, married to economic dogma,  have exerted far more influence on policy and communication than scientific  evidence. A federal and state policy adviser during the 1990s observed in an  interview: ‘The biggest barrier (to effective greenhouse action) is the intellectual  mindset of economists and their belief systems about whether government  should be a player in changing the economy’. 85 </page> <page sequence="10"> Global Warming and Climate Change Frank Muller called those who advised government based on these beliefs  ‘econocrats’. In econocrat thinking, following neo-classical economics,  governments should not regulate or interfere in markets because all efficiencies  are already in the system. So, requiring energy efficiency measures, for example,  constitutes unwarranted interference in the relevant industries and markets. Comparing his Washington D.C. experience during the administration of  President Bill Clinton in the mid-2000s to an ongoing situation in Australia,  Muller said:  In Canberra we have not had the countervailing science influence to the  econocrats. There are not people presenting the story to the decision- makers that ‘we can do something’ about (climate change) right now. So  the denial in government policy circles is real ... their experts are telling  them they don’t have to deal with it right now.  The free market ideas that inspired not only Australian policymakers in the  1990s, but the English-speaking Western democracies in general, were a revision  of neo-classical liberal economic theories, known as ‘economic rationalism’ in  Australia. (Thatcherism, Reaganomics, and the Washington Consensus are other  labels on the neo-liberal theme). This set of economic assumptions, beliefs, and  values was gathering steam in the 1980s, and came to govern Australian public  policy and national conversations as the 1990s progressed—hegemony in action.  Trading an ethical, responsible world view for  economic self-interest The previous ‘ethical’ understanding of climate change risk (stressing the  public interest, intergenerational equity, inter-country responsibilities, etc.),  was replaced by a world view promoting economic self-interest as the dominant  value. The public was encouraged to focus on its consumer rights while citizen  responsibility took a back seat. This shift away from moral values and responsibilities was highlighted in a  surprising press release that appeared in November 2006. Heralded as a world- first event, 16 Australian religious denominations spanning all faiths, issued a  joint statement regarding the need to value the planet and life. Skirting national  and religious exceptionalism, concern about climate change was described as a  core matter of faith and morality. The release said that politicians will be held accountable to ‘do something’  about addressing climate change. ‘It’s not just about the price of coal, or  about whether we can’t do anything ... it’s absolutely important that such a  86 </page> <page sequence="11"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs large issue ... is reflected in our own moral beliefs, whatever faith they are,  when you’re confronted by the nature of this kind of challenge’ (Crittenden  2006). An umbrella movement called green Christianity does, as in some other  religions, view the natural world as one of kinship and humanity’s role as one of  stewardship, rather than a relationship of domination and exploitation. Following the 2006 statement, the Australian Religious Response to Climate  Change (ARRCC) network was established in 2008 to provide educational and  campaign resources to faith communities to respond to climate change and lead  by example with environmentally sustainable practices. In 2014 members of the  ARRCC were being arrested in protests against a proposed coalmine in in the  Leard State Forest in northern New South Wales. The religious challenge, similar to that of others interested in safeguarding  the natural environment from carbon pollution and other negative changes,  is reacting in part to the demise of the traditional concept of ‘public interest’  under economic rationalism and the loss of ethically based policies for climate  change action.  A change in the perception of what constitutes the public interest and the  validity of government action on behalf of the public versus private sector  interests was closely connected with the ideas popularised by a new generation  of economists. Some 50,000 graduated between 1947 and 1986 according to  social scientist Michael Pusey, who published a definitive study of the Canberra  bureaucracy in 1991.  These graduates brought both neo-liberal economic ideology and a narrow  technocratic training to the policy arena. This was in comparison to a broadly  humanistic training, ‘liberal’ in another sense, which was common before World  War II. Contemporary economic specialisation: ‘almost invariably excluded  any broadening study of philosophy, sociology or the history of ideas’ (Pusey  1991: 172). (This is true also for the study of other technical and scientific  specialisations by the 1980s and 1990s.) A neo-liberal or neo-classical, economic rationalist world view assumes that  individuals and businesses, given the freedom to choose, will rationally choose  to maximise gain and profit, and everything else flows from that. The new  narrative, amplified by the media as politicians and think tanks talked this  language, stopped discussing risk, equity, and the public interest in regard  to climate change, and instead focused on costs and the dollar bottom line to  consumers and business. This was framed for public consumption as the proper  concern for jobs, family, and national interest—that is the mainstream interest.  In practice, economic rationalist thought and policies (including national  competition policy) quickly dispensed with ambitious state plans for energy  87 </page> <page sequence="12"> Global Warming and Climate Change efficiency measures, renewable energy and fuel substitution that were  developed before 1992. The dominant narrative changed to assign unattractive  costs to efficiency and renewables (compared to conventional generation of  ‘cheap’ electricity) on the theory that the energy market is already at maximum  efficiency. Of course the computer models that underpinned these changes are only as useful  as their baseline assumptions. Economic rationalist models reached their cost  assessments while discounting some factors. They did not, for example, factor in  the cost to society of large government subsidies supporting mining and coal-fired  electricity. They also ignored ‘externalities’—the costs of production that can be  shunted outside the corporation or producer, including the cost of environmental  consequences such as emission of greenhouse gases. Economic rationalist  modelling also appeared not to give equal weight to any potential benefits arising  from renewables or efficiency over time (Industry Commission 1991). The lessons of economics Universities have been the incubators of changing economic theory, including  economic rationalism in Australia, during the past 40 years. The lessons taught  as basic economics have influenced a generation of bureaucrats, politicians, and  policy advisers.3 Relatively little attention, however, has been paid to what is  actually taught to impressionable young minds. American journalist Christopher Hayes spent an academic quarter auditing  ‘Principles of macroeconomics’ at the University of Chicago and provided a  snapshot of the material that was taught in the course. Efficiency is the defining  value of the Chicago School of Economics (home base for the late Milton Friedman’s  version of neo-classical or neo-liberal economics, which resonated in Australia),  and is still the basis for instruction. ‘Too much’ government (regulation or public  ownership of assets or services) causes inefficient economies in the overall quest  for capital growth (Hayes 2006). The international capital market is seen as the primary regulator of a society,  and that view continues to prevail despite the global financial crisis of 2008.  The conversion of natural and human resources into capital growth will raise  everyone’s standard of living, domestically and globally, without government  regulation. With ‘no limits’ and ‘endless growth’ forming an embedded part of  this thinking, questions of sustainability have not applied. 3 Jones (2002) noted that The Australian National University School of Economics was prominent in  producing the home-grown neo-liberal theorists and free trade economists who advised Labor and Coalition  governments from the 1980s on. 88 </page> <page sequence="13"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs This version of economics is called neo-classical because the injunction to  ‘specialise and trade’ harks back to Scottish political economist and philosopher  Adam Smith’s 18th century insights about ‘comparative advantage’ and what  creates the ‘wealth of nations’. John Howard regularly invoked ‘our comparative  advantage’ of exporting fossil fuels when defending Australia’s limited actions  to lower emissions.  In this economic universe, normative models are transformed into reality.  Translated that means: arguments about the way the world should be are  converted into assertions about how the world actually is, without the need for  empirical data or evidence (in ‘econ speak’, converting normative arguments to  positive statements). Thus, ‘people cannot disagree with neo-classical economics,  they can only fail to understand it’ (Hayes 2006: 28).  This version of economics presents itself as a value-neutral description of how  the world is: therefore students do not perceive they are learning an ideology.  (In a similar fashion, Keynesian regulated capitalism enjoyed a consensus of ‘this  is the way the world is’ before and after World War II—until the early 1970s.)  Hayes learned that theory is demonstrated through economic modelling—simple  supply and demand at the level of tertiary education—and is taught regardless  of real-world empirical studies that indicate the facts can be otherwise. Hayes  also witnessed the use of contrarian, sceptical positioning as a tactic to skewer  opposing points of view, institutions or consensus. This is familiar territory  in the successful deployment of contrarian debate in the public discussion on  climate change. The defining characteristics of present-day  economics At The Australian National University Centre for Resource and Environmental  Studies, economist Jack Pezzey told students at a 2006 seminar that ‘economics  is a mind-set’ and that several relevant defining characteristics of the discipline  of economics as we now accept it are (my italics): • Anthropocentricity—there is no value unless it is related to human notions  of value; thus environment is seen as an ‘amenity’ or ‘input’ • consumer sovereignty—the neo-classical view is that economics reflects  people’s preferences, rather than shaping them (even though people’s  preferences are always shaped by the culture around them).  • non-satiation—the notion that people or firms always prefer more ‘well  being’ (translated as profit), rather than less 89 </page> <page sequence="14"> Global Warming and Climate Change • aggregation—the focus on average or total variables, not their distribution,  which is the province of politics • finite trade-offs—nothing is beyond price  • discounting—means that future costs and benefits are always worth less  than today’s. (Thus, economically, climate change happening in 30, 50, or 100  years time is uninteresting). The gold standard of neo-classical economics is the marginal cost of supply,  which has led to the demand for ‘no regrets’ solutions to climate change,  meaning there should be no increased cost to the economy or individuals. ‘No  regrets’ has since become bureaucratic jargon applied to various transactions,  usually with minimal understanding by an outsider of what the term means.  There are alternative schools of economic thought; for example, ecological  economics rejects many of the key concepts of neo-classical economics and its  ‘no-limits’ assumptions, and can pose deeper philosophical challenges to the  anthropocentric value system. Where did this thinking come from? English historian Richard Cockett has traced the current thinking of neo- classical free enterprise to the so-called Austrian School at the London School  of Economics. Led by Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper and Lionel Robbins, this  school began criticising the then prevalent Keynesian economics of regulated  and ‘welfare capitalism’, starting in the 1940s.  Friedman and his colleagues of the Chicago School at the University of Chicago  were influenced by the English economists and proposed similar radical remedies  starting in the 1950s—to end regulation of economies and to minimise the state/ public sector. Friedman was later to have direct influence in Australia through  his thoughts on globalisation and capital markets, which were taken up by both  major Australian political parties, and as a speaker invited by think tanks (Klein  2007). These theories and thinkers started their global influence with biannual  international meetings at Mont Pelerin in Switzerland; these meetings were the  origins of the Mont Pelerin Society that provides an international network to  this day (Murray &amp; Pacheco 2000).  A myth to live by Economic rationalist theorists decreased the role of government support and  industry protection while opening Australia more to international financial  90 </page> <page sequence="15"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs markets: moves that were supported by both major political parties. The  enthusiasm for ‘free trade’ and ‘free markets’, and the underlying assumptions of  neo-classical economics, was accepted as early as the 1970s in Gough Whitlam’s  Labor Party and was reconciled, more or less, by successive governments with  Australia’s industrial relations framework, environmental regulation and other  forms of social good up until the 1990s. While recent history shows that economic rationalist restructuring of the  economy has combined with international market demand in Asia generally  and China specifically to produce a period of increased national affluence, the  ideology has also attracted critics of its underlying assumptions in a longer term  context. Political economist Evan Jones characterises the evolution of economic  rationalism into the dominant way of looking at the world as opportunistic and  neither coherent nor logical, but rather a convenient ‘myth to live by’ driven  by belief rather than a background of empirical evidence. He suggests that ‘the  universalism of the solutions is a clear indication of their religious character:  ideology has rushed in to fill the vacuum left by the poverty of analysis’ (Jones  2002: 57).  Nobel Prize-winning US economist Joseph Stiglitz reportedly voiced a similar  critique saying neo-liberal theories can best be understood as another belief and  values system, rather than being based on empirical facts. The dominance of  the neoclassical model is ‘a triumph of ideology over science’ (Hayes 2006: 27). Politics as battle of ideas In the end, politics is a battle of ideas and a battle of commitment. John Howard, 2002 Economic rationalism finds its historical place within a ‘battle of ideas’ that has  been waged simultaneously with the environmental movement’s rise in the late  1960s and 1970s. Parts of the ideological underpinnings stem from 19th and 20th  century ‘wise use’ philosophy. Wise use and its variants developed in pioneer  countries like the United States and Australia where influential elites were also  against government regulation in general and particularly if applied on behalf  of the natural environment (Ehrlich &amp; Ehrlich 1998). In this value system rights  include the individual’s right to derive wealth from nature. Wise-use thus  also links to previously noted religious thinking of human domination over  nature. These beliefs easily convert to anti-environmentalism and exceptionalist  arguments. 91 </page> <page sequence="16"> Global Warming and Climate Change Free enterprise, individual property rights and ‘wise use’ were philosophical  cornerstones of Reaganomics or supply-side economics in the United States,  Thatcherism in the United Kingdom, and economic rationalism in Australia.  Deregulation and competition policy have been other cornerstones leading to  privatisation of public assets, including electricity generators, as well as an all- out commitment to ‘free trade’ by both major Australian political parties (‘Labor  in power’ 2010; Sturgess &amp; Torrens 2009).  Before looking more closely at how competition policy affected the climate  change story, it’s worth asking how these ideas, building on underlying beliefs  and values, became part of the communication mainstream and were embedded  in Australian institutions and in society at large. Think tanks supplied the ammunition Right-wing or pro-market think tanks have generated much of the rhetorical  ammunition for neo-liberal policy. They have enjoyed considerable influence  in Western English-speaking countries in the past 30 years—specifically in the  United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia,4 with the understanding  that changing the dominant narrative was the pathway to success.  ‘Like other movements, the main impact of the radical neo-liberals was  not direct policy influence but broader discursive shifts ... demonising and  disorganising opponents of neo-liberalism’ (Cahill 2004: 24). Tactical advice,  high-profile speakers and organisational liaison between countries has been  common. ‘Because of this, the ideas of Friedrich Hayek, Public Choice Theory,  Milton Friedman and developments in neo-liberal theory and neo-liberal policy  alternatives have been disseminated in Australia’ (Cahill 2004: 8–9). Think tanks are non-government policy centres funded by corporations, private  money and the taxpayer. They have overtaken more informal networks (the  club, the school or university, the corporation) as vehicles for ideological battle.  They have adopted the trappings of academic and scientific research—the  conference, lecture, and journal. Their thinkers are able to be far more definite  and far less constrained by peer review on issues like climate change than the  scientific convention dictate. They publish the writings of sceptical scientists,  4 Cahill, following the seminal work of Cockett in the mid-1990s, documents how overseas think tanks  influenced neo-liberal thinking in Australia and the establishment of Australian think tanks: ‘Radical neo- liberal organisations such as America’s Heritage Foundation, Britain’s Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) and  international networks such as the Mont Pelerin Society and the Atlas Foundation served as examples for the  Australian movement to emulate’ (2004: 8). 92 </page> <page sequence="17"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs which are seldom peer reviewed or their authors questioned on their relevant  expertise (Cahill &amp; Beder 2005; Jacques, Dunlap &amp; Freeman 2008; Murray &amp;  Pacheco 2000).  The fossil fuel industry-supported IPA is the oldest and probably best known of  the Australian free market, neo-liberal think tanks and has long been associated  with the Liberal Party in executive roles. IPA Executive Director John Roskam  has worked for both the government of Jeff Kennett in Victoria and the Howard  federal government in the 1990s. Policy positions advocate privatisation and  deregulation; limiting the role of unions and non-government organisations  on policy and contesting the science and policy initiatives involved with  environmental issues such as climate change. Its environmental arm has been active in communication and, during the  1990s and since, it has attacked climate science in books and articles by  sceptic academics, such as geologists Ian Plimer and Bob Carter, former bureau  meteorologist William Kininmonth and former CSIRO division head Brian  Tucker.  ‘Doubting Australia: the roots of Australia’s climate denial’ is a document  compiled by Australian non-government climate action groups with assistance  from sourcewatch (a collaborative watchdog wiki directed by the US Center  for Media and Democracy that produces documented information on policy- oriented think tanks and their activities). It credits the IPA as being ‘at the heart  of climate denial in Australia’ since the early 1990s when it started inviting  US sceptics to this country. Links to US and UK think tanks (including wise- use philosophers) strengthened after 1996 with well-publicised sceptical events  (including with (Lord) Nigel Lawson’s foundation where Howard spoke in  November 2013) (‘Doubting Australia’ 2010).  According to ‘Doubting Australia’ (which offers 118 links to source documents  for its exposé of think tank connections to climate change denial in Australia  since the mid-1990s) the IPA’s support for sceptical geologist and mining  company director Plimer and his 2009 book Heaven and Earth, which argues  that global warming is not happening, has been very effective communication.  The book reportedly sold more than 40,000 copies in Australia and it was  supported not only by the Murdoch press, but reportedly defended by the  Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) as a legitimate balancing voice on  climate science, despite Plimer’s lack of scientific credentials in that area and the  factual mistakes that critics found in his book. Plimer’s book impressed then Opposition front bencher Tony Abbott, who was  quoted in a 2009 ABC Four Corners program on the proposed emissions trading  scheme in the following terms: ‘I think that in response to the IPCC alarmist—ah  93 </page> <page sequence="18"> Global Warming and Climate Change in inverted commas—view, there’ve been quite a lot of other reputable scientific  voices. Now not everyone agrees with Ian Plimer’s position but he is a highly  credible scientist and he has written what seems like a very well argued book  refuting most of the claims of the climate catastrophists.’ The program provides  direct testimony from Liberal and National Party politicians, now in power, of  their divided or negative views on climate change science and action (ABC 2009).  Plimer toured Australia for his book with entertaining but science-free UK  climate sceptic (Lord) Christopher Monckton, claiming an emissions trading  scheme would damage the mining industry with irrational demands. He also  has signed international documents attacking the premises of mainstream  climate science. This included an international petition by retired geologists,  meteorologists (including Kininmonth) and others to Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harpur urging him to dismiss emission reduction proposals as the  ‘“catastrophist” fabrication of environmental groups’ (Providing insight into  climate change). In the run-up to the 2013 federal election, Abbott was publicly associating  with the IPA, most notably responding to its radical policy wish list with a  rhetorical ‘big fat yes’. The list started with ‘repeal the carbon tax’, abolish  the Department of Climate Change and abolish the ‘clean energy fund’. At the  time he also attended a well- publicised IPA birthday dinner with much mutual  backslapping with mining billionaire Gina Rinehart and News Limited owner  Rupert Murdoch, whose newspapers pulled out all the stops to elect Abbott and  his party. The Tasman Institute, established by former Monash University economics  lecturer Michael Porter in 1990, like the older IPA, adheres to economic rationalist  theories and positions, with direct and indirect relevance to climate change  policy development. The Institute’s 1995 annual review revealed a ‘who’s who’ of  Australian resource industries among the 21 corporate members and its flagship  project at that time was called ‘Markets and the environment’. Its focus was issues  affecting investment in Australia’s resource-based industries (Maddox 2005). The  Tasman Institute was amongst the first to criticise Australia’s proposed climate  change response strategy (Economics and the environment 1990).  Think tank influence was overt in the case of Project Victoria in the early 1990s  with a market-forces deregulation blueprint produced by the Tasman Institute  and the IPA accompanying the new Liberal government under Kennett in 1992,  which put a stop to ambitious state plans for energy efficiency in domestic  and commercial sectors and the state electricity commission plans to decrease  consumer demand (Cahill &amp; Beder 2005). 94 </page> <page sequence="19"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs Other influential Australian think tanks with similar economic orientation are  the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), the Centre for  Independent Studies (CIS) and the Business Council of Australia (BCA) (Murray  &amp; Pacheco 2000). The CIS started in 1976 in the garage of then high school maths  teacher Greg Lindsay, going from rags to riches thanks to corporate sponsorship  from Western Mining’s Hugh Morgan among others. CIS linked economic  rationalism with social conservatism under Christian and family values icons.  Researchers have called it a favoured brain trust for not only Rupert Murdoch,  but also John Howard during his tenure as prime minister (Maddox 2005).  During the 1990s, the BCA’s president Hugh Morgan and his associate from the  mining industry, Ray Evans, featured prominently in reports on the development  of not only the Tasman Institute and CIS, but also other pro-market, socially  conservative, Christian values and scientifically contrarian think tanks in  Australia (Hamilton 2006; Maddox 2005). That list includes the Lavoisier Group,  established in 2000 specifically to counteract climate change science, with  Morgan as the first president and Evans as secretary (Lavoisier Group).  Speaking at the 50th anniversary of the conservative journal Quadrant, Howard  was candid about the ‘war of ideas’ that must be fought. He reportedly named  Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II as the ‘towering  figures’ of the late 20th century for their moral clarity and ideological opposition  to all collectivist thinking as ‘stultifying orthodoxies and dangerous utopias.’ He  spoke of the historical battle of ideas for Western civilisation and ‘the essential  connection of personal, political and economic freedom’ (Schubert 2006). With think tanks delivering a steady stream of reports and ideas to politicians  and to like-minded media editors, particularly in the Murdoch press, economic  rationalist beliefs couched as ‘the economy’ came to dominate public discussion  and thinking (which is a good working example of hegemony) by the mid- 1990s and particularly thereafter. But already with Labor under the Hawke  government at the turn of the decade, a dominant pattern had been evolving  around market economic thinking. ‘Ministers and their top staff see the world  very much as male age-mates through a shared and restricted formative training  in economics’ (Pusey 1991: 8).  The ‘public interest’ becomes the corporate  interest  Championing the neo-liberal agenda ‘Australia’s foreign-owned media, the  New Right think tanks and research centres ... have had an enormous success  in penetrating the Canberra apparatus, and [also] international economic  95 </page> <page sequence="20"> Global Warming and Climate Change organisations such as the World Bank and the OECD’ (Pusey 1991: 13). This  economic set of ideas was extended to the administration of semi-independent  organisations, such as the CSIRO, as they were corporatised and directed to  serve industry. The economic rationalist world view increasingly painted the  public interest as indistinguishable from that of large extractive industries. Federal and state bureaucracies realigned their thinking according to the  new economic orthodoxy. In terms of climate change response, they came to  downplay the benefits of the easiest response—energy efficiency strategies. Since  the economic rationalist view was that markets are, by definition, ultimately  efficient, the conclusion was that mandating, for example, efficient commercial  or industrial facilities or household appliances must add costs and ‘intervene’  in markets unnecessarily. The net effect was ‘industry capture’, which made  progress on greenhouse policy extremely difficult (Hamilton 2001: 33).  Environmental consultant and RMIT academic Alan Pears worked in the area  of energy conservation and efficiency in Victoria from the 1980s on. He saw the  changes that economic ideology wrought and he noted that, in 1994, the federal  Treasury Department of Paul Keating’s Labor government released a document  bowing to a ‘perfect market structure’ and a focus on unfettered competition.  The capture of the bureaucracy, policy advisers and major institutions and  its effect on climate change policy was investigated further in the mid-2000s  by political scientist Guy Pearse. He documented a significant revolving door  between industry lobbyists for (often transnational) corporations extracting  Australia’s mineral, soil and water resources; the federal bureaucracy; and  ministerial advisers. The agenda-setters shared an economic and cultural  ideology, ‘a group think’ which allowed them to work together inside or outside  government.  Previous messages about risk and the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions  from fossil fuel use threatened an economic blueprint that, in greenhouse risk  analyses, is called ‘business as usual’ or retaining the status quo. Those messages  of risk and proposals for a different energy economy had to be contained and  neutralised, a strategy pursued by the revolving door corporate activists and  advisers (Pearse 2007). Radical belief change from social democracy  since World War II  It is hard to overestimate the impact of these beliefs on what Australians came to  view as normal or reality by 2000. Economic rationalism in Australia, a revival  96 </page> <page sequence="21"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs of the English and American free enterprise tradition, had a seismic effect on  the values of social democracy characterising Australia for much of the 20th  century. Economic regulation in the public interest, (now called ‘intervention’)  along with associations organised for community or environmental benefit to  society, would come under increasing attack as being against the economic  wisdom and mainstream society.  The mainstream was framed as individual, self-interested working consumers  focused on the domestic sphere. The information-fragmenting possibilities of  the internet and new media have, arguably, cemented this view of society.  A return to free enterprise, minimal government and libertarian theories are  said to re-emerge with the needs of capital (Cahill 2004). The current incarnation  was spurred by a slowdown of economic activity in the 1970s following two  decades of prosperity after World War II that flourished under Keynesian  welfare capitalism. That model of capitalism also promoted mass markets,  citizens becoming consumers, and also fed expectations of endless growth while  science and technology boomed. John Maynard Keynes’s economic blueprint,  however, approved of managing consumer demand (upward and downward)  and industry regulation to benefit employment and social goals.  Such policies eventually benefitted environmental protection as well, as the first  wave of environmental awareness in the 1970s demonstrated. The period after  World War II was also characterised by unprecedented support by governments  (both capitalist and communist) for science. Technological advances fuelled both  the postwar production and consumption boom, and also set up a belief system  in the ‘techno-fix’ for all problems facing society.  Until the 1990s, a social democratic political approach remained strong in  Australia in part as an ‘accord’ between capital and labour. A more inclusive  approach to decision-making, including scientists and environmental  organisations, was a hallmark of the late 1980s, along with the occurrence of  political bi-partisanship for the public interest. The ecologically sustainable  development (ESD) workshops were a peak example of this inclusive, mainstream  approach.  Climate change communication left with  persuading individual consumers  The success of economic rationalist ideas in Australia may have been hastened  by the recession of the early 1990s, following similar overhauls in the United  States (Reaganomics), and in the United Kingdom under Thatcher in the  97 </page> <page sequence="22"> Global Warming and Climate Change previous decade. This world view also normalised the goal that societal relations  with ‘the market’ had to be voluntary and by choice. That left climate change  communication the challenge of persuading citizens to go beyond a manufactured  debate and do the right thing. Paralysis was the more likely outcome, seen again  in the recent policy fight over carbon pricing—couched as an impost to the  citizen’s hip pocket—as if a whole range of responses are not in fact called for.  The individual’s prerogative to believe or reject scientific findings flourished in an  arena where political leadership had come to mainly express doubt or ignorance  and where economic theory emphasised the right to choose for individuals now  framed exclusively as consumers or sole traders in a market society. That way  of looking at social reality downplayed concepts of community and the public  interest and was matched by the downgrading of non-government organisations  in the political arena, in line with the thinking of the IPA and other think tanks.  ‘A disinclination to deal with groups has been reinforced in the major parties by  the fashionable theology of public choice theory. This has cast interest groups  as selfish and self-serving, and has disputed their representational legitimacy’  (Marsh 2005: 222). In this environment, the combined agenda-setting capacity  of business lobbyists, politicians and the media encountered little opposition  to resetting the climate change narrative during the mid- to late 1990s. Political  researchers of this period have documented the ‘elites only’ decision-making on  greenhouse policy of the Howard government after 1996: conferring in serious  fashion almost exclusively with corporate leaders of the resource extraction and  energy sectors (Hamilton 2006; Pearse 2007).  Belief in ‘growth is everything’ In countries dominated by market economics, growth remained the central  political objective. US political scientists William Ophuls and Stephen Boyan  wrote in 1998: ‘Growth is the secular religion of American society, providing a  social goal, a basis for political solidarity and a source of individual motivation’  (Ophuls &amp; Boyan 1998: 187). They noted that American politics is a record of a ‘more or less amicable squabble  over the division of spoils of a growing economy’ (Ophuls &amp; Boyan 1998:  187). Even a superficial review of 1990s, and more recent, Australian political  economics and culture, exposes the same unexamined, cultural mythology  of growth and material consumption underpinning society’s wellbeing and  prosperity. This thinking governed default responses to the call for climate  change action. For example: 98 </page> <page sequence="23"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs US President George W. Bush and Australian Prime Minister John Howard  have concluded their bilateral talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, confirming  their stance on climate change ... ‘We don’t believe that Kyoto is the  answer’ [Mr Howard] said. ‘We can have a debate about the severity  of the problem, but there is really no debate about the desirability of  responding to it, provided we do it in a way that maintains economic  growth in our societies and the world.’ (‘Howard firm on opposition to  Kyoto’ 2005)  Events since World War II seem to have justified this scientifically flawed belief  in endless growth—we see prosperity increased, populations booming, ever  more resource extraction worldwide, and human mortality dropping in western  societies. There have also been opposing studies and arguments for some time.  The 1972 Club of Rome study, Limits to growth, applied ‘systems dynamics’  to economic and ecological trends. It measured trends in resource extraction  and the effects on underlying biosphere life-support systems. The assessment  concluded (generating much controversy at the time) that ‘the limits to growth  ... will be reached sometime in the next 100 years. The most probable result  will be a sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial  capacity’ (Boyden 1987: 217).  The 1990s International Geosphere Biosphere Project (IGBP) studies have shown  downward capacity in all natural systems as human activity (the anthropocene)  affects the planet. The context is a frequently quoted calculation, attributed to  E.O. Wilson, saying that at present rates of resource consumption, if everyone  consumed resources at the same rate as Australia or the United States, we would  need four additional similar planets to remain sustainable. Competition policy no help to greenhouse  response  Another arm of neo-liberal beliefs in Australia that significantly affected  domestic greenhouse policy in the 1990s was the push for National Competition  Policy. This was aimed at moving publicly-owned assets and infrastructure into  private ownership or at least into a competitive national market. Competition  policy, strongly favoured by the Keating government, worked against climate  change response through its effect on energy provision and infrastructure, a  state responsibility.  With a mandate to corporatise and compete, state-run electricity providers  dropped early 1990s commitments to energy efficiency and renewable energy  programs and moved into a national competitive arena vying for new customers.  99 </page> <page sequence="24"> Global Warming and Climate Change With time, the energy sector became adversarial, and business leaders as well as  political leaders became dedicated to ‘supply-side’ energy management; that is,  out to sell more energy for more development and growth.  The simultaneous reframing of the energy efficiency option from ‘can do’ to  ‘can’t do’ was achieved with a ‘discourse of inevitability’ insisting there were no  alternatives to the economic ideas gaining ground (Broomhill 2001). In theory,  the 1992 National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS) committed federal  and state governments to a range of greenhouse response measures, particularly  in the energy sector which, in the mid-1990s, was estimated to contribute  67 per cent of Australia’s greenhouse CO2 emissions and 53.4 per cent of total  greenhouse emissions. The free market direction, however, simultaneously erected financial barriers  to efficiency and renewable energy measures. For example, commercial interest  rates favoured status quo energy production over innovation and new ventures.  Financial barriers also encouraged not putting a price on carbon pollution,  which is something economists call an ‘externality’, i.e. not a core business  expense (Walker 1996). Summing up what he saw happening since the early 1990s, environmental  consultant Alan Pears said that whether on energy efficient domestic or  commercial buildings, efficient appliances, or transport, Australia during the  1990s and into the mid-2000s experienced an ‘almost complete policy failure’ in  curbing greenhouse gas emissions. He said in an interview:  We know how to make cuts in every sector, some demonstrably  successful. But there are powerful economic groups and narrow theorists  and nervous politicians believing that environmental action will hurt  the economy. It’s been a brilliant PR strategy, and it’s left the community  confused and disempowered. These beliefs are based on interpretations  of crude economic modelling and reinforced by the preconception that  you help either the environment or the economy.  Pears supports the view that there has been a deliberate political strategy,  developed with the resource industries—many of which are multinationals—to  discredit the science and scare the electorate with economic modelling on costs.  By the second half of the 1990s, energy conservation and fuel substitution had  fallen off the policy agenda—in favour of supply-side techno fix proposals such  as clean coal, and the nuclear option for a time. Energy sector deregulation and privatisation with a mandate to compete  nationally yielded a prime example of the profound influence of belief and  100 </page> <page sequence="25"> 6. Influences on a changed story and the new normal 1990s: values and beliefs values on Australia’s climate change story—with the shift away from a previous  state of political/economic bipartisan agreement about the overriding public  interest of curbing greenhouse gas pollution. In terms of the new normal that was created, it’s worth repeating that regulation  of industrial activity for the greater public good has only recently become a  taboo idea. For example, 25 years ago then CSIRO chairman, Neville Wran, told  The Australian Financial Review that regulation might be needed to achieve  emission cuts (McKanna 1988: 4). This possibility dropped away entirely during Howard’s prime ministership  as well as from Coalition policies starting in 1996. Australia started a still- unfinished era of the purest expression of economic rationalism and free market  capitalism yet seen in this country (Sturgess &amp; Torrens 2009). In terms of climate  change response, the public story now rejected ‘costs’ to markets or regulation  to rein in emissions. Politicians, financial supporters of free market think tanks, and leaders or  lobbyists for mining, agriculture, aluminium and electricity generation agreed  that there could be no change from the status quo or extra costs to combat climate  change. Widespread inefficiencies in the industrial sector, as freely reported in  the early 1990s, made the prospect of additional costs more threatening.  Enter the media Neo-liberal ideas and ways of seeing the world have entered the media mainstream  both through the preferences of editors and owners and also via conservative  columnists who have been rarely, if ever, connected explicitly to think tanks or  what they stand for. For example, while IPA environment director, biologist Dr  Jennifer Marohasy penned a column for The Land for many years just under her  name and shared her sceptical views on climate science with a rural audience  without transparent links to her IPA position. Others connected to the IPA have  written columns for Murdoch tabloids over the years. In Australia a little of this  has gone a long way to setting the public agenda, particularly when these ideas  agree with the approach of the government of the day, as we see in the next  chapter on the media role. 101 </page> <page sequence="26">  </page> </plain_text>
