<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Note on Vaccirakk?ttam by Jeyapriya Rajarajan I wish to thank Dr Laura Giuliano profoundly for her excellent article, 'On vajrapurusa', accompanied by prolific photographic evidence (more than 50 photos) on the subject since the 3rd century A.D. (N?g?rjunakonda) to the 11th century (Los Angeles County Museum). The author's most important finding is that ?yudhapurusas may be traced back to the 3rd century of the Christian era on the basis of archaeological sources. Though the archaeological sources are abundant, the paucity of literature to back up the subject pushes back the idea of a ?yudhapurusa to 500 B.C. or earlier. The earliest source supporting vajrapurusa is the Mah?bh?rata (XII, 31, 27-28, cited in Giuliano 2001: 291, dated by Macdonell 1979: 233 in 500-50 B.C. or 700 B.C.?), which has a clear notation of the personified vajra. The other evidence is that of a gryas?tra by Gobhila (dated during 500-200 B.C. by Macdonell 1979: 206, 210-11). In Gobhila a deity called As?ni is equated with Agni 'and can also be interpreted as personification of the thunderbolt' (Giuliano 2001: 292-93). The deity is supposed to be worshipped 'at the plough-field-sacrifice, at the stacking-threshing-field sacrifice, at the sowing, at the reguing of the crop, at the removal of the corn to the store-house' (Giuliano 2001: 293). The association of agriculture with Vajradevat? is evident here and Indra as master of the clouds i1) may be linked with the soil and its fertility. The divination of the vajra is evoked in the Brhddevat? (dated during 500-200 B.C. by Macdonell 1979:236,321) along with other Vedic divinities. In the next stratum of pur?nic lore, the vajra occurs in the Siva Pur?na (5th century A.D.) concerning kamya (rites performed for some particular object and with a view to future fruition Bhide 1990: 352) and the weapons of Mahesa (Giuliano 2001: 293). The weapons fixed at the various quarters were tris?la 'trident' (northeast), vajra 'thunderbolt' (east), parasu 'battleaxe' (southeast), s?yaka 'arrow' (south), khadga 'sword' (southwest), p?sa 'noose' (west), ahkusa 'elephant-goad' (northwest), Pin?ka 'Bow of Siva' (north) and Ksetrap?la 'Guardian of the Place' (west) (2). The personified vajra is also noted in the Suprabhed?gama, Ahirbh?dhnyasmhita and other sources. Thus from about 700 B.C. to 600 A.D. there are various texts in Sanskrit (Skt.) which refer to the vajra in its personified aspect. The vajra in Vedic tradition was the weapon of Indra and came to be associated with Skanda. Indra had an encounter with Skanda (cf. n. 1) at the time of his birth. Indra destroyed the six babies born to Devi by his vajr?yudha and Devi created a single baby (Kalidos 1999a: 77). Later, Indra gave his daughter Devasen? in marriage to Skanda and presented his (1) Indra, due to an encounter with Krsna, ordered the clouds to pour rain and destroy Gokula when the gopis refused him his due honour and festival in the Bh?gavata Pur?na {infra). The Cilappatik?ram 5 and Manimekalai 1 have a chapter each on Intiravil? 'Festival of Indra'. The vajra might be a metaphor for the lightening, caused by the violent movement of the clouds. (2) The west occurs twice. [1] 291</page><page sequence="2">vajr?yudha. Thus, the vajra became Skanda's missile. Early Tamil sources down to the 10th century A.D. do not associate the vajra with Skanda. It is in Agamic sources that the vajra is attributed to Skanda (Kalidos 1999a: 75-79, 81). The Siv?gatnasekhara gives a list of 17 iconographical typologies of Subrahmanya of which eight (N?nasakti-, Skanda-, Agnij?ta-, Saurabheya-, Saravanodbhava-, K?rttikeya-, Kum?ra- and Guha-, all suffixed with -Subrahmanya), possess vajra. Those not taking the vajra are G?hgeya-, Sanmukha-, T?rak?ri-, Sen?ni-, Brahmac?ri-, Desika-, Krauncabhedana-, Sikhiv?hana- and Vel?yudha- (Kalidos 1999a: 86-89). It is interesting to note that in early medieval art (c. A.D. 550-850) images of Skanda were reported from Elephanta, Ellora (e.g. Caves XXI, XXII), Bad?mi, Tirupparahkunram (Kalidos 1991: 263-79), Tirumalai (Rajarajan 1992: fig. 5) and other places. In none of these specimens is the vajra associated with Skanda, excepting Tirupparahkunram north (Kalidos 1992: chaps. II to IV). The vajra was also a weapon of the M?tfka, Indr?ni (feminine of Indra) (Giuliano 2001: pis. 37-38; Panikar 1997: pis. 56-57,192). Indra was known as Vajrap?ni 'of the thunderbolt hand' (Dowson 1998: 127). Regarding vajra Dowson (1998: 332-33) has the following to say. It was made of the bones of a psi called Dadhichi (cf. Mani 1996: 191). It was supposed to be a circular weapon with a hole in the center. Others considered it as consisting of two transverse bars (Banerji 1981: figs. 1-6; Wessels-Mevissen 2001: 95, figs. 70, 205, 226, vajra in the right hand). Vajra had several names. They are As?ni, Abhrottha 'sky-born' [abhriyam 'a mass of thunder clouds', Bhide 1990: 129), Bahudh?ra 'much cleaving' ('the thunderbolt of Indra', Bhide 1990: 796), Bhidira ('Indra's thunderbolt', Bhide 1990: 826), Chhidaka 'the splinter' ('Indra's thunderbolt', Bhide 1990: 472), Dambholi ('Indra's thunderbolt', Apte 1976: 246), Jasuri 'destructive' {jas 'to hurt', 'injure', 'strike', Bhide 1990: 482), Hr?din 'roaring' ('thunderbolt of Indra', Bhide 1990: 1202), Kulisa 'axe' ('thunderbolt', Apte 1976: 155), Pavi 'pointed' ('the thunderbolt of Indra', Apte 1976: 327), Phenav?hin 'foam-bearing', Satkona 'hexagon', Samba ('Indra's thunderbolt', Bhide 1990: 1038) and Svar? ('heaven of Indra', Bhide 1990: 1180). Dowson, Apte and Bhide differ in the meaning given for the different names of vajra, indicated in the foregoing account. In most cases, the epithets are associated with vajra or Indra. The aim of the present note is to invite scholarly attention, including that of Dr Laura Giuliano, to observe a few rare notations on vaccirakk?ttam (3) (cf. L'Hernault 1990: 201) in ancient Tamil (T.) literature that could be dated as A.D. 200. The text with prolific notes under the heading vajra is the Cilappatik?ram (dated to the early centuries of the Christian era by traditional scholars [Subrahmanian 1990] or A.D. 450 [Zvelebil 1974: 132; Kalidos 1993: 75], likely 5th century A.D.). This work notes a number of temples for the various divinities and ?yudhapurusas, as at the ancient city of Puk?r or K?viripp?mpattinam (4), the (3) Vacciram means vajr?yudha 'thunderbolt missile' {Puran?n?ru 241; Subramonian 1962: 565). (4) The city was also known as Camp?vati (T. Camp?pati). She was the protector-goddess of the city. In other words, she was a patron-goddess (e.g. Matur?pati at Maturai, Kalidos 1993: 81). Camp?vati was originally the capital of Anga (Pargiter 1972: 272). The name Camp?vati is derived from Jambhu(dvipa) (T. N?valantivu) and was originally the protector of the Jambhu continent. Could Jambhu be a derivative of J?rhbhala, a Buddhist God? For literary notions of this goddess see Manimekalai (Patikam 11. 1-8, 26-31, 2. 1-9), a Tamil epic, dated in the 6th century A.D. Camp?pati's temple was known as Mutuy?lk?ttam 'temple of the Primeval Goddess' (Manimekalai 17. 88). For detailed a examination of the type of temples see Rajarajan 1996: chap. II. 292 [2]</page><page sequence="3">capital of the Carikam-Colas (5). Temples for deities of the Indian pantheon are noted, as follows: Amarartarukk?ttam Velyanaikk?ttam Pukarvellai n?kartank?ttam pakalv?yil Uccikkil?nk?ttam ?rkk?ttam verk?ttam Vaccirakk?ttam purampanaiy?n v?lk?ttam Nikkantakk?ttam nil?k?ttam... Cutuk?ttukk?ttam... K?mavelk?ttam... (Cilappatik?ram 9. 9-20, 60). In all these notations the common word, k?ttam (Skt. kostha) means a 'temple'. The prefixed words refer to the god or goddess to whom the temple was dedicated. The deities are the following: Amarartaru: Skt. kalpakavrksa 'the wish-fulfilling tree' Vely?nai: 'white elephant', Skt. Air?vata, Indra's vehicle Pukarvellain?kar: 'the white skinned person', Baladeva Pakalv?yil-uccikkil?n: 'personified day, the Lord at the sky', S?rya ?rkk?ttam: 'temple of the city', presiding deity of the city (nagaradevata), called Camp?pati (cf. n. 4) Verk?ttam: vel = Skt. sakti, a temple for the Sakti-?yudha Vaccirakk?ttam: vacciram = Skt. vajra, a temple for Vajra Purampanaiy?n: God on the outskirts of the city supposed to be S?sta (cf. Puranilaikk?ttam in Kalittokai 82) Nikkanta: Prakrit Nigranta, a Jain palli 'temple' (6) Nil?: 'the moon', temple for Candra 'Moon' Cutuk?tu: 'burial ground', supposed to be a temple for Dakini (cf. Cutuk?t? tukk?ttam or Cakkarav?lakk?ttam) [Manimekalai 6th k?tai, 7. 91) K?mavel: temple for K?ma or Manmatha. In another context, the temples in the city of Puk?r are listed as follows: Pirav?yakkaipperiy?n k?yilum Arumukaccewel anitikal k?yilum Nilameni Netiy?n k?yilum M?laivenkutai mannavan k?yilum... Arav?r palliyum... (Cilappatik?ram 5. 170-173, 179). In all these quotations, the common word k?y? stands for a 'temple'. In the present list Indra stands on a par with Siva and Visnu. The deities listed are the following: Pirav?yakkaipperiy?n: the unborn great one Siva Arumukaccewel: the six-faced Velan (7), Murukan or Skanda (5) Two families of the C?las ruled the Tamil country during the early centuries of the Cahkam Age and later during the 9th-13th century A.D. (Kalidos 1976: 42-47, 119-48). Those of the Cahkam Age are called Cankam-C?las. (6) The Jain temple was also known as Arukatt?nam {Cilappatik?ram 10. 18) or Ar?ntnam (Manimekalai 5.23). (7) The holder of the vel = saktz is known as Velan = Saktidhara (cf. Kalidos 1999a: 75).

Nilameni Netiy?n: the blue-coloured tall (God), Visnu M?laivenkutaimannavan: King of Rains, the white-banner holder, Indra Arav?rpalli: palli of the Dharmas, the Buddhists (8). (8) The Buddhist temples were also known as Intiravik?ram = Indravih?ra and v?loli-cayittam, cayittam = caityagrha (Manimekalai"28. 70, 131, Intiravik?ram is noted in Cilappatik?ram 10. 14). 294 [4]</page><page sequence="5">From the foregoing study, it may be understood that in the ancient city of Puk?r there were temples for Siva, Visnu, Baladeva, Murukan, Indra, S?rya, Candra, K?madeva, S?sta, the Goddess of the City (Camp?pati), Dakini, the Jinas and the Buddha. Others are personifications of Kalpavrksa, the Air?vata, the Sakti and the Vajra (9). On the island at Srirangam (called Arahkam, cf. Kalidos 1993-95: 136-52) a temple for the reclining Visnu was/is present. It was known as Manivannan-??/ta#z (cf. Jeyapriya 2003). To the south, en route from Arankam to Maturai, there was a temple for the Mother Goddess in the wild forests. It was called Aiyaitan-k?ttam {Cilappatik?ram 11. 215), perhaps after the Tamil Goddess called Aiyai or Korravai (= Skt. Mahis? suramardini) (10). At the city of Maturai, a number of temples were dedicated to a cavalcade of the gods. In this context, the temple is called k?yil, niyamam, nakaram, k?ttam and palli lowing: (n). Let us read the fol Nutalv?in?ttat tiraiy?n k?yilum Uvanaccevaluyarnt?n niyamamum Melivalavanuyarnta veljai nakaramum K?liccevar kotiy?n k?ttamum Aratturaivilarikiya arav?r palliyum Maratturaivilahkiya mannavan k?yilum. (Cilappatik?ram 14. 7-12) Fig. 2 - Detail of Fig. 1. (9) There were common places where divinities resided. Known as mamam and catukkam (Cilappatik?ram 5. 113-140) some of them were: vellitaimanram (open court hall or pavilion?), ilancimamam (bathing ghat that cured diseases?), netukalmamam (hall of tall pillars where poison healing took place, netukal also means 'hero stone'), p?tacatukkam (square where the hh?ta punished wicked people) and p?vaimanram (hall installing a virgin goddess). These are the aivakaimanram 'five halls'. Catukkam is a court where four roads meet. (10) The identification of Korravai with Mahis?suramardini is attested in the Cilappatik?ram (20. 34-36) itself. She is one who stands on the decapitated head of a buffalo, that has just been slain and from whose severed head blood pours: Atarttelu kuruti yatank?p pacuntunip/pitarttalaip pitam eriya matakkoti/ verriverratakkai Korravai. She is called the Goddess of Victory in the cited passage (cf. Kalidos 1993: 80). (n) The vocabulary in Sanskrit is rich that denotes a temple or residence of god or human being. Note the following: vim?na, pr?s?da, grha, devagrha, agaram, ? lay ah, kulam, mandiram, bhavanam, vesman, harmya, vih?ra, sudh?mayam and saudha (Amarakosa cited in Rajarajan 1996: 12). [5] 295</page><page sequence="6">Though various terminologies are used to denote a temple, the gods specified in the above notation are the following: Nutalvilin?ttat tiraiy?n: one who has an eye on the forehead, Siva Uvanaccevaluyarnt?n: one who has the garudadvaja, Visnu Melivalavanuyarnta vellai: one who holds the ploughshare and is white in colour, Baladeva K?liccevar kotiy?n: one who holds the rooster banner, Murukan-Skanda Aratturaivilankiya arav?r: for whom dharma is foremost, the Jains Mannavan: the ruler of the land, the King. In various other places, the Cilappatik?ram (28. 225, 30. 151, 30. 87-88) denotes temples for a Chaste Goddess, who is the Pattini or Mankalamatantai, the notations being Pattinik k?ttam and Mankalamatantaik-??/ta/^ (12). The variety of gods to whom temples were dedicated is essentially shared in the two regal cities of Puk?r and Maturai, the capitals of the Cankam-C?las and Cankam-P?ndyas. The specialty of Maturai was the temple for a Goddess of Chastity, Pattini (for the historical crosscurrents see Kalidos 1993). Puk?r housed several other temples for personified weapons and other divinities. It may also be noted here that Tamilakam 'land of that Tamils' of the tradition prevailing at the time divided the lands into five tracts and assigned each a god or goddess. They are as follows: kurinci (hilly region): Murukan (in pristine T. Cey?n, the Child) mullai (forest region): Visnu (T. M?y?n, the illusionary) marutam (fertile fields): Indra (T. Ventan, King) neytal (littorals): Varunan (Skt. Varuna) p?lai (deserted lands): Korravai (Kalidos 1976: 58-60) (13). The Cilappatik?ram in its list of temples at Puk?r and Maturai includes all the deities other than Varuna. On the other hand, the gods included are Siva, Baladeva and others. The most important from our point of view are the temples for Kalpakavrksa, Air?vata, Vel-Sakti, Vacciram-Vajra, Uccikkil?n-S?rya and Nil?-Candra. S?rya and Candra are personifications of the day and night. Temples for these two gods were known in the Tamil country through the ages. The Cilappatik?ram {Mahkalav?lttupp?tal 1-4) has the invocation: tihkalaip p?rrutum tihkalaip p?rrutum [...] n?yiru p?rrutum n?yiru p?rrutum 'Let the Moon be Exalted, Let the Moon be Exalted [...] Let the Sun be Exalted, Let the Sun be Exalted'. The Sulapurusa added later finds a remarkable sculptural illustration in Cola art (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, it is unusual during historical times (e.g. Pallava, C?la, Vijayanagara-N?yaka) to (12) For a brief account of these temples, see Kalidos 1999: 147; Rajarajan 2000. (13) Literary sources aver that there was no separate land called palai. When kurinci and mullai during famine lost their original ethos of fertility, these two tracts became palai 'desert'. That means Korravai coexisted with Murukan and Visnu. Again, this was only a theoretical division of the land vis-?-vis deities. For example, a temple for Murukan had existed since time immemorial at Tiruccent?r, which was a neytal land. 296 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 3 - Vajrapurusa (right) in the Murukan temple, Tanc?v?r. (Photo by R.K.K. Rajarajan). come across separate temples for Kalpakavf ksa, Air?vata, Sakti and Vajra. However, certain rare images of S?lapurusa and Vajra have been reported by L'Hernault (1993: figs. 1,10) in the Tamil country. The non-personified vajra is found in a temple for Murukan at Ilaiyanavel?r in a subsidiary chapel that could be considered as evidence of vaccirakk?ttam. There is further significant evidence of vajrapurusa that were discovered by Dr R.K.K. Rajarajan and brought to [7] 297</page><page sequence="8">the author's notice (Figs. 1-3). These are found in the Subrahmanya-Murukan shrine inside the R?jar?jesvaram (C?la temple of R?jar?ja I A.D. 985-1014) at Tanc?v?r. The dv?rap?lakas appearing at the threshold of the Murukan shrine (N?yaka period, 17th century A.D.) are presented as vajrapurusas. In these cases, vajra appears up on the headgear of the dv?rap?lakas (Figs. 1-3). In these two cases, the vajra and vajrapurusa are associated with Skanda-Murukan and not Indra. The temple paraphernalia included the Kalpakavrksa and Air?vata as v?hanas of the gods during utsava 'festival' (Kalidos 1988: 98-101). However, it is conceivable that around the 5th century A.D. and earlier, there were temples for personified deities in the Tamil country. This was the case for the vajra and vel. What is more important, while the Sanskrit sources speak of personified vajra, the Tamil sources assign vajr?yudha a separate k?ttam 'temple' in the ancient city of Puk?r. Most likely it was associated with Indra mentioned in the context of Intiravil? and his temple (infra). A temple for Indra is noted in an earlier text, the Puran?n?ru (241. 3): vaccirattatakkai netiy?n k?yil 'temple of the Tall One (Indra) who carried a vajra in one of his hands'. An anthropomorphic image of Indra is likely to have been housed in such a temple. It is a clear notation of a temple for Indra but not his weapon or its personification. Besides the Cilappatik?ram, the vaccirakk?ttam is also noted in the Manimekalai (1. 27). The Cilappatik?ram (5. 140-144) adds that in the temple of the vajra a drum was kept. The drum was taken out on the Intiravil? 'Festival of Indra'(cf. Dowson 1998: 127 and Parthasarathy 1993: 46, 408, calls it Sakra dhvajotthana 'the raising of the standard of Indra'), mounted on a horse and beaten to announce the arrival of the festival to the people of Puk?r. It was apparently a big festival because it was celebrated for twenty-eight days. Therefore, it might be presumed that the vajra being the weapon of Indra it symbolically represented Indra himself or 'the incarnation of Indra's power' (Giuliano 2001: 289). The vajra could have been in its personified aspect or simply the ?yudha alone. It was installed in a temple and worshipped. No iconographic detail of the deity is given nor any detail of the type of temple in which it was housed. The vacciram as a weapon of Indra occurs in some pre-Cilappatik?ram literature. These are Kalittokai (105. 15) and Parip?tal (5. 52), dated to the 4th-5th century A.D. by Zvelebil (1974: 47-49). The Parip?tal (5. 52) notes the vaccir?yutam (vajr?yudha) as a weapon of Indra. Indra Fig. 4 - Sulapurusa, Sulamarikalam. (Photo by R.K.K. Rajarajan). 298 [8]</page><page sequence="9">was known after the vajra as is proved by the following epithets: Vacciratt?n (cf.

Vrija (Vajra?) was the name of a country among the ancient mah?janapadas such as Ahga, Vahga, Magadha and so on (Thapar 1972: 50-55). Pargiter (1972: 265) notes Girivraja and not Vrija. Nilakanta Sastri and Srinivasachari (n.d.: 65) note Vajji. In the present context, Vrija denotes the missile of Indra. In Tamil sources, the Vajra country is called Vacciranann?tu (Cilappatik?ram 5. 99). Others noted are Magadha and Avanti. From these countries, architects were invited to come and work in the Tamil country as from the Yavana (the Hellas, Cilappatik?ram 5. 101 104). The Vajras erected a korrappantar 'king's pavilion', Magadhas pattimantapam 'debating hall' and Avantis t?ranav?yil 'arched entrance' (ibid.). The yavanas were taccar 'sculptors' or 'carpenters'. [9] 299</page><page sequence="10">In brief, the Tamil sources in Puran?n?ru (early centuries of the Christian era), Cilapp?tikaram (5th century A.D.) and Manimekalai (6th century A.D.) talk of temples for Indra and his weapon, the vajra. To begin with the vajr?yudha was the weapon of Indra and later came to be associated with Skanda-Murukan. Therefore, subsidiary chapels for the vajr?yudha existed in temples of Murukan. The personified vajrapurusa was installed in temples for Murukan. It should also be noted here that the vajra is associated with Murukan in later ?gamas and sdpas?stras and not in early Tamil literature down to the 10th century A.D. (Kalidos 1999a). No separate temple for Indra seems to have survived or to have been built in historical times (Pallava to N?yaka). Indra was more a member of the dikp?lakas as guardian of the east in later times (Wessels-Mevissen 2001). Perhaps around the 6th century A.D., due to the encounters with Visnu and Skanda, Indra lost his god par excellence status as in the Rg Veda (Srinivasan 1983: 547-48) and became a minor deity, counted under the astadikp?lakas. NOTE ON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS On looking at the final output of the present note, my teacher Prof. Raju Kalidos wanted me to add a brief explanation to the photographic illustrations. The Ilaiyanavel?r image portrays the weapon, carved on a stone slab. It is not the personified vajra. The dv?rap?lakas in the Murukan sub shrine of the R?jar?jesvaram at Tanc?v?r represent two modes of Vajrapurusas with the weapon mounted on their heads. Of these, one (Fig. 1) is the usual mode that one may come across in any part of India. The other (Fig. 3) conforms to the description of Krishna Sastri (1916: 272, fig. 20) in which two inverted tridents are combined. Both the vajra-personified dv?rap?lakas are supposed to be guardians of the temple to Skanda. The Sulapurusa (Fig. 4) at Sulamankalam 'Village of S?la? seems to be an image of the early C?la period, possibly of Muttaraiya (a C?la feudatory) lineage. It is housed in a later temple. The village itself takes its name from the s?la. No other important deity is housed in this temple. It seems to be a stray image collected from the neighbourhood and housed in a temple. 300 [10]</page><page sequence="11">REFERENCES Amarakosa, Bombay n.d. Apte, VS.
