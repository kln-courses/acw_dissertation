<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHITNEY DAVIS Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art Since we overcame the error of supposing that the forgetting we are familiar with signified a destruction of the memory-trace-that is, its annihilation-we have been inclined to take the opposite view, that in mental life nothing which has once been formed can perish-that everything is somehow preserved and that in suitable circumstances (when, for instance, regression goes back far enough) it can once more be brought to light. -Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents' I IN WHAT FOLLOWS I am interested in what textbooks of art history ordinarily call paleolithic art-that is, the "cave art" of southwestern Europe in the Upper Paleolithic period until about 10,000 B.C.-not so much as such but for what we might learn from it about a general problem, namely, the context in which and the conventions by which a graphic pattern is taken to be an image of some reality. Although many art historians may not know or care much about paleolithic art, the problem as such is familiar to all of us in our day-to-day busi- ness of interpreting images and through our reading of methodological men- tors-E. H. Gombrich, Nelson Goodman, Richard Wollheim, and others.2 Image making was and is a distinctive cultural achievement, but it can be derived logi- cally from simple and archaic perceptual and cognitive processes.3 This is not at all to say that image making was caused by or is the product of culture or of per- ception and cognition in culture. Throughout, it will be one of my fundamental premises-although an argument will be advanced for it as well-that cognition and culture simply are networks of representational systems, each with its partic- ular biology, neurology, psychology, and history.4 Our problem is to account non- circularly for these representational systems which constitute cultures. If this problem is so familiar and has been so extensively debated, why do I choose to address it with such unfamiliar historical and archaeological evidence? For one thing, I want to know whether the familiar arguments are at all workable when extended to more or even the most alien conditions. More important, and without giving away too much in advance, paleolithic art in itself has some very special archaeological features that make it a theoretically provocative and helpful test case, both in stating and in attempting to solve the general problem.

But those traditions are likely to be even more unfamiliar than the European cave art. These features can also be found in the art of the West-in the painting, say, of Michelangelo, Manet, or Jackson Pollock-but here in such a familiar way as to be unhelpful. I will introduce the problem by introducing or reintroducing paleolithic image making very briefly.5 The earliest two-dimensional images recognizable to us in the archaeological record are found incised on small limestone blocks from rock-shelter sites near the village of Les Eyzies in the Dordogne valley of southern France, assigned to early and later phases of the so-called Aurignacian culture, the earliest identifiable subculture of the Upper Paleolithic in southwestern Europe (fig. 1).6 These incised-or, in the parlance of paleolithic archaeology, "engraved"-blocks are dated stratigraphically or by cultural association to between 32,000 and 26,000 B.C., toward the very beginning of the Upper Paleo- lithic sequence and among the earliest cultural remains of "fully modern man," Homo sapiens sapiens, in this part of the world. In fact, H. sapiens sapiens is some- times diagnostically distinguished from H. sapiens neanderthalensis, H. erectus, and other hominids at least in part by the very presence of "cultural" remains of this kind.7 The images are quite minimal, incised very deeply, pecked out with a stone point, or painted in simple strokes. Blocks 1, 2, and 5 from the Abri Cellier (figs. la, lb, Ic),8 plausibly associated with an Aurignacian I level, can be considered the earliest in the group. Blocks 1 and 5 depict only what appear to be the horns and parts of the heads or backs of ibexes. Block 2 is thought to represent a horse's head. Block 16 from La Ferrassie (fig. 2),9 dated to the end of the Aurignacian sequence (Aurignacian IV), represents the four legs, without feet, and part of the underbelly of an ibex or other herbivore. The other blocks are not closely datable to any subphase of the Aurignacian, although they probably all belong to this general culture period. Block 1 from the Abri Blanchard (fig. Id) seems to show the head and part of the back or neck of a horse or cervid.'0 Block 5 (fig. ie) represents an animal's head with open jaws." Block II (fig. 3) depicts the hind legs and underbelly of an animal var- iously described as a horse or bison, painted in black lines, with the ground, or perhaps the interior parts of the animal, in red.'2 Block 12 is thought to join this block, and at the moment shows only the two legs of an animal-the front legs of Block I1, or another creature. Finally, from the Abri du Renne (Belcayre), the only complete outline engraving of an animal securely dated to the Aurignacian period (fig. If) seems to represent a herbivore with a very short tail, possibly a stag or an ibex.'3 If we are feeling liberal, this exceedingly short list could be expanded to include a few other examples. For example, Block B from the Abri Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 113</page><page sequence="4">FIGURE 2 (top left and right).

A limestone block from the Abri Labatut, found between two Upper Perigordian levels at the site (c. 23,000 B.C.) and sometimes thought to have fallen from the wall of the shelter through some natural process of exfoliation, may represent the continuity of the Aurignacian tradition of making images-either on portable blocks or, as may be here, trans- lated to the surfaces of walls. It represents a horse, but apparently, as before, relies solely on deeply incised or "sculpted" outline.'4 It is difficult to say much about any of these representations without building in prejudicial assumptions about significance or style. With the exception of the Belcayre figure (fig. If) and of the later figure from Abri Labatut, all of the draw- ings depict only parts of the animals-such as horns, foreparts, dorsal lines, or legs. In this, it is not immediately clear whether the drawings are merely incom- plete, as is sometimes said, or intentionally abbreviated but metonymically standing for the whole animal, or symbolically self-sufficient depictions of indi- vidual interesting features. 15 The identifications of the species depicted are very insecure. Stylistic assessment is problematic. Since indices of style depend upon com- parative measures, the very earliest material is, in a sense, stylistically unmeasur- able. Possibly it is legitimate to say, with many commentators, that the drawings are schematic, simplified, or stiff. However, we do not really know what standard of performance could possibly be relevant in this context. Many of the Aurignacian blocks also bear engravings of what are often thought to be female genitalia, and other marks or "signs" like short series of linear strokes and hollows (fig. 4).16 Possibly these markings were all jointly sig- nificant. Several observers have remarked a systematic order in some of these markings.'7 At this point, it is important only to draw attention to the possible association between image and nonimage in these early works. Moving on from 26,000 B.C., the better preserved and more frequent images of the succeeding Gravettian through Solutrean eras-that is, down to about 17,000 B.c.-seem to derive organically from the earlier Aurignacian. For instance, a bison from the cave of La Greze (fig. 5) seems strongly reminiscent of the early engravings in the simple, deeply engraved line, profile silhouette, and selective attention of the engraver. 18 The line here is beginning to do more work; the continuously modulated double or S curve has far greater descriptive and expressive power; and the images appear more elaborate and authoritative. The so-called archaic and classic styles of the later Solutrean and Magda- lenian, after 17,000 B.C., are best known in the remarkable cave paintings of Las- caux, Pech-Merle, Altamira, and other sites, datable to around 14,000 B.C.'9 In these works, the analogical, continuously varying, or (in Goodman's terms) semantically "dense" quality of the representational line has been generalized to Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 115</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 5.

It is worth trying to pinpoint why art historians have been uncomfortable with this question. A survey of the literature-not only the literature of paleolithic art will show that we hardly ever do ask directly whether in any given historical instance we are working with images, and usually assume instead that images are unproblematically recognizable as such and somehow in advance of beginning art-historical research on and interpretation of them. If I can establish anything here, I hope it will be that the question must be asked and re-asked at every turn in art history. (I will even try to develop a precise 116 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">notion of what these "turns" might be.) In fact, it is a kind of art history-a kind of archaeology-that must establish images as images in the first place. To assume image is to shut our eyes to a real historical process. The paleolithic graphics underline the question nicely. Some of the usual approaches to the question "Is this an image?" do not work quite well when applied to material like this. One approach is to say that we recognize the objects depicted by the marks. Here, however, we were not really certain what the objects might be-"abbreviations" of animal figures, or just parts of animals, and exactly what parts? Another approach is to say that the material looks sufficiently like material already accepted to be an image. Here, however, if we want to avoid anachronism and are otherwise correct archaeologically, there is no material before the Aurignacian already and unequivocally accepted as image. Further- more, it is surely fair to say that these graphics also look sufficiently like material we would not accept as image. These are only intuitive approaches, and only somewhat damaging, not fatal, objections. They do at least suggest that we must think again about how we recognize some visual patterns as images. Although it is going to be difficult to do even minimum justice to some argu- ments, let us assume that we apply some a priori notion of an image to new evi- dence as it is discovered archaeologically, archivally, or whatever. In one standard definition, the image looks like or resembles its object. Any simple mimetic theory of representation is easily demolished and should not detain us here. Many things resemble many other things without being images of them. How do we know how to distinguish an image from any chance resemblance?22 In another definition, the image is analogical, the variables of line and color continuously varying. By contrast, a notation is digital; its characters are dis- crete.23 Still, an image can be produced using a digital technology-like the Aurignacian engravings produced by pecking out separate holes, or Seurat's poin- tillism, or a television transmission, to take obvious cases. Apparently the separate marks are not taken as separate marks but rather as continuously correlated in a single pattern perceived all at once. But how would we know that we are looking at such an analogical pattern, "morphologically indiscernible"-to borrow Arthur Danto's term24-as it might be from a pattern of merely separate marks? How do we know to take it analogically and not digitally? Images may appear as characters in a notational system, like Egyptian hieroglyphs. How do we know how to distin- guish images from nonimages here? Such problems with these and other standard formal definitions have sug- gested that it is only knowledge of certain contexts of use or of so-called "conven- tions" that tells us precisely what we are looking at. Simplifying and synthesizing a good deal of debate, and presenting a somewhat personal view, there are, I think, two fundamental conditions for a lump of matter or two-dimensional pat- tern to be an image. Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 117</page><page sequence="8">The first condition can be called the constitutive criterion (CC): some particular features of the pattern must be determinable as signifying. There are no essential or universal features of a pattern that will necessarily establish that it is a sign; conversely, there are no features that cannot establish it as a sign. Consequently, the particular signifying features of the mark must be determinable in practice for the pattern to be constituted as a sign at all. We will need to know how this determination is made. Recall that a pattern must resemble many things in many respects but is not apparently an image of all of those things. The second condition can be called the criterion of specific resemblance (CSR): some particular resemblances between the pattern and things in the world denote what they resemble.25 These two conditions are often casually collapsed in the single formula, cor- rect as far as it goes, that in an image particular resemblances signify. However, for our purposes it is critical to keep the two conditions as separate as possible (fig. 6). Although the mark has features that establish that it signifies an object (CC), some of these features must also resemble that object for the mark to be an image (CSR); however, the features of the image that resemble the object (CSR) may not exhaust the features that establish that the image does so depict (CC).26 The criteria CC and CSR classify the features of a pattern in different and some- what cross-cutting ways. CC sorts signifying from nonsignifying features. CSR sorts resemblant features as signifying or nonsignifying. When CC and CSR are operating simultaneously (that is, in an image), some features will necessarily be sorted as both signifying and resemblant. However, not all features picked out by CC and by CSR will fall into the intersection CC U CSR (namely, nonresemblant signifying features). Moreover, some features do not have a status at all in the sorting CC + CSR (namely, nonsignifying features, resemblant or not). The fea- tures of a pattern that are both signifying and resemblant, by definition to be found in images, should not distract us from the fact-intuitively obvious-that any so- called image also has these other, nonsignifying and/or nonresemblant features and that there are important orders of resemblance that are not pattern-to-object but rather pattern-to-pattern (this order, of course, is what we mean by style). The two conditions operating simultaneously can be regarded as the criteria for the interpretation of marks as images. (Here I will not attempt to give an analysis of this process as a cognitive computational algorithm, although I believe such an analysis would be possible and desirable.) Under interpretation, certain resemblances between marks and things are taken as depictions of objects. We need to recognize that this identification is not unproblematic; it is quite special and contingent-"context-bound," in the preferred lingo of contemporary art history. For one thing, an interpreter need not always perceive the same pattern of marks in the same way. At one moment we might perceive a pattern as merely a pattern; at another as resembling but not denoting a face, or denoting but not 118 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="9">a. FEATURES b.

CC and CSR each classify different features of the pattern but conjointly establish the image. resembling a face; or, finally, as an image of a face, both resembling and denoting it. The context in which image interpretation occurs is evidently a specific one. Furthermore, a second interpreter may also perceive this same pattern as an image, but in this case, as a different image-say, an image not of a face but rather of an animal. Therefore the context in which image interpretation results in spec- ifying this particular image-of a face and not an animal-is also evidently a specific one. In sum, interpretation is fundamentally "correctible," in A.J. Ayer's apt phrase.27 Different interpreters can take marks as being images or not and as having the same or different objects. Since an interpreter could fail to see an image at all or could see several different images, taking a pattern in some context Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 119</page><page sequence="10">as this particular image seems to be arbitrary and conventional to the very extent that it is contingent and variable in that context. Although I will not consider its various expressions or versions (such as in debates about naturalistic or relativistic modes of approach and about "natural" or "conventional" signs by writers like Goodman, Gombrich, orJ. J. Gibson), here, I think, we have reached the founding argument of much of contemporary art history. The argument certainly provides a specific subject matter for art history to take as its own. An interpreter must learn the "convention" (CC + CSR) that in a particular context particular features of a mark establish it as an image. There- fore the initial business of art history would be, in Umberto Eco's words, to iden- tify "the cultural procedures and operative processes that go to make up the predication of homology between mark and object."28 Far more insidiously, and on a tendentious understanding of conventions, the argument also suggests that only an art history-or, more broadly, a cultural history-could provide an ac- count of any substance, for the learning of the convention could only take place culturally, by induction or actual instruction. Actual instruction in the interpretation of images might take place in some literal sense, and it has led to unfortunate metaphors of culture as a school to be attended, a theater to be witnessed, or a text to be understood. Learning about images minimally requires only consistently successful induction: the observed uses of a pattern as an image of a particular object is all an interpreter needs to perform in the same way. However we find it, learning requires another inter- preter or group of interpreters to establish the use of images, examples of accept- able images from which to learn, and so forth: it requires culture. But something has gone badly wrong here somewhere. An account of learning how to interpret images by induction or instruction in a given cultural setting ultimately begs the question by landing us in an infinite regress. If interpreter, is instructed by interpreters, did interpreters in turn learn from yet another, interpreter3? Ultimately we would have to know by whom the first teacher was instructed: we end in paradox. Alternatively, interpreters learned the interpretation of marks as images by induction before instructing interpreter,. Here, though, he must have observed interpreter, using images, in turn picked up by induction or instruction-and so on. Any regress of this kind can be minimized by focusing on the performance of a single individual in a given cultural setting, as it were absorbing, trans- forming, and passing on culture (representations). Not surprisingly, methodolog- ical solipsism is deeply entrenched in our discipline. Furthermore, we can always leave it to others-the anthropologists or the historians-to determine what the "given setting" amounts to, despite the likelihood that commonality of culture is best defined to begin with as the mutually intelligible use of various representa- tional systems. But wished away or not, the regress is profoundly unsatisfactory from an evolutionary or historical point of view. 120 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">Again, the regress may not seem to be too troublesome in some historical contexts: the conventions are supposedly ancient and widely shared. But when Willibald Sauerlander argues that the apparent homogeneity of style in the classic tradition is an artifact of what he calls aesthetic historicism, or when T.J. Clark wonders why literate bourgeois critics could not interpret the painting of Manet,29 we are no longer relegating the strong effect of the regress-the puzzle of how and where to terminate it-to the obscurity of origins or to the dramatic conflict of revolutions but seeing induction and instruction as somehow always and everywhere unreliable and incomplete. The infinite regress may not be so infinite. In our case, the puzzle of the regress is pure and unadulterated: Aurig- nacian engravers had no previous images to consult, no previous image inter- preters to observe, no conventions to learn. How, to use Saul Kripke's words, did an "initial baptism" somehow "fix the reference" of the patterns on the blocks?30 III A genuine solution, I think, requires rethinking what the so-called "convention" or "conventions" of image making amount to. Shifting out of semi- otic and iconological doctrine-that image is a code, is learned, is inaugurally ruled or stipulated, is culturally conventional, and so forth-we can say that making an image is not something we learn about a pattern but rather something we do with it. An image is a tool or, more broadly, a "form of life.' In this, I want most of all to preserve our vivid impression as art historians that the history of the image has something to do with its intelligibility. To avoid infinite regress (and related circularities in what might be put for- ward as an intentionalist or [neo-]Gricean analysis of image meanings),32 the interpretation of images can be regarded as a program or sequence of steps none of which individually assumes the operation of CC and CSR in advance. At the end of the sequence, all of the relevant operations of CC and CSR are in place; the program is image interpreting. In brief, the program builds depiction from more primitive-that is, evolutionarily antique and cognitively anterior-judg- ments of similarity and substitutability between features of a mark and things in the world (including other marks). Although no features of a mark are necessarily privileged in the beginning, and none are inherently perceived to resemble or denote anything, in the continuous replication of marks some of them will be specified as denotationally resembling objects. Although I will reserve a fuller presentation for another forum, and in particular do not defend notions of sim- ilarity, substitutability, and replication in any detail, let me proceed briefly through the stages of this argument.33 We start from the simple perceptual experience of taking a two-dimensional mark for something else-perceiving a blot as a hole, a line as an edge, and so Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 121</page><page sequence="12">forth. Our interpretation of the mark is an instance of the common, general expe- rience of what is usually called seeing-as, following Wittgenstein. For our pur- poses, seeing-as is erroneous perceptual interpretation, a simple equivalence equation in which mark = thing; it is involuntarily erroneous, and quite predict- able given how information is structured in light presented to the eye, that is, ambiguously.34 Usually the perceptual system detects that it has made a mistake. A movement of the head or refocusing of foveal vision will show that a shape in the distance is really a mark on a nearby surface. The correction is often called disambiguation, and like seeing-as is involuntary and automatic. It requires no instruction and the inductions are as it were built in to the human nervous system. Now, after successful disambiguation, examination will show the mark to be very similar or even perceptually identical to the thing in some respects, at least in part the respects perceived in seeing-as, but different in others, at least in part the respects perceived in disambiguation. If and when the mark is replicated, for whatever purpose or lack of purpose, these respects of resemblance and nonresem- blance in relation to the thing perceived in seeing-as can be reproduced or varied. Assume, then, that we have such a chain of replications before us.35 The crit- ical point for us is that in this chain, reproducing and varying both resemblant and nonresemblant features, the thing perceived in the mark can be held con- stant-or, more precisely, the features perceived to resemble that thing in an episode of seeing-as can be reproduced or varied in replication without variation in the judgment of resemblance. The fundamental chain of replications for our purposes has a "canonical form" (fig. 7). In this chain, some features of the marks are constantly judged to resemble the same thing (a-e), although the marks, com- pared mark to mark, might be judged resemblant (a-b) or nonresemblant to some degree or in some respects (b-e). In a chain of replications, mark-to-mark resem- blance, mark-to-thing resemblance, and thing-to-thing resemblance are inter- twined but potentially bifurcating. Simple enough-but note that the whole chain need not be made with the advance "intention" to hold the thing-resemblance constant or even the advance knowledge (this cultural, conventional knowledge) that thing-resemblance can be held constant. Although I will not go into this matter at length, for it is logically and perhaps historically anterior to our problem of image making, the chain may be the simple product of replicating particular marks, as "worn out" or otherwise requiring reproduction in another time, place, or medium from their first pro- duction, or even more simply, of scribbling or rhythmic repetition. Not every chain, of course, will ever or eventually take the canonical form for even part of its length. Perhaps the mark maker makes no replications at all. More important, presuming a mark maker is not initially replicating marks for their thing- resemblance, in replication the resemblant features could be too quickly erased for their constancies to be discovered. Despite the special replicatory conditions that give rise to it, a chain of the 122 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="13">canonical form-or associated derived and complex forms-is all that is required to give depiction. Consider that an artifact is ordinarily replicated in order to preserve and modify certain of its features in and for further use. In an ordinary tool, the functional features are preserved throughout a chain of replications, and varied within certain limits-else the function changes or the tool becomes al- together functionless. The tool is replicated for the function. Similarly, and on this model, depiction is not the replication of an intrinsically special or unique kind of mark, or the application of special and unique interpretations to otherwise mun- dane marks, but rather and much more simply the replication of marks for the purpose of reproducing and varying features that resemble the thing initially en- countered in seeing-as. More briefly, an image is a mark replicated for seeing-as. Phrased this way, the "convention" or "conventions" of interpreting a pattern as an image and the so-called arbitrariness or correctability of this interpretation amounts to recognizing that the convention is not a code to be cracked but an historical function to be discovered: a pattern has been produced and reproduced for some particular resemblance to things it had in a moment of seeing-as. How do we distinguish replicating the mark for seeing-as from other replica- tions that merely preserve thing-resemblance? After all, the mark maker might a. 1 SEEING-AS a'.l 1 R. llr DISAMBIGUATION b. M T1 REPLICATION (IDENTICAL REPRODUCTION) c. M R, T1 REPLICATION - _R2 ll (VARIATION) d. M R2 -R3 e. M RRR2 T - R4 f.

Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 123</page><page sequence="14">just set out to reproduce particular resemblant features (that is,just those features, irrespective of their resemblance). Here, however, he would hold those particular resemblant features constant throughout a chain of replications. But, as we have seen, particular resemblant features do not have to be held constant for the judg- ment of resemblance to the thing to be held constant. In one "image," the curve of the animal's back is established by a shadowed incised line, in the next the same curve is established by a black painted line, and so forth. The catch, clearly, is that no amount of morphological analysis of the mark alone will tell us it is an image. The question is precise: confronted with a mark produced for its particular thing-resemblance, that is, as an image, how does an interpreter know that this is indeed its status, that is, that the purpose of its pro- duction is the preservation of seeing-as? (We can, I believe, safely assume that in many cases the interpreter is simply provided with this information in advance, but in my view this is not a penetrating analysis of what he could and should do, left to his own devices.) And the answer seems precise enough: the very variability of nonresemblant morphology throughout a canonical chain of replications indi- cates that a particular resemblant morphology has been preserved for its thing- resemblance, subject to the condition just noted that from mark to mark the resemblant morphology may itself be variable. This is a complete translation of what we understood by CC and CSR: particular resemblances "denote" what they resemble in the sense that in relation to other and all features of the mark partic- ular resemblant features are determinably produced for their thing-resemblance or as having a thing-resembling function, else the chain of replications would not have the (canonical) form it does. But by these terms, an interpreter cannot know a priori or from the mark alone which conceivably resemblant morphologies of the mark, conceivably being held constant in a chain of replications, he should identify as depictional. He must know the whole chain of replications back to the initial moment of seeing-as and disambiguation, that is, the whole field of resemblant and nonresemblant morphologies and their indifferent or different substituta- bility in a chain of replications. This condition is extremely strict. An interpreter must be very well informed about mark making and about judgments of resemblance rendered (or render- able) on marks. It may be that he can be instructed in parts or in the whole of the relevant chain. Moreover, on the basis of "archaeological" evidence or observation and experience, he might be able to infer what the chain actually happens to be. We will look at this possibility shortly. However, without the whole chain he cannot be completely certain what he is recovering from the mark. Interpretation becomes necessarily historical. As my account implies, even within a given culture-whatever we might accept this puzzling entity to be-an interpreter must become an archaeologist of the marks with which he is presented. The business of art history, sine qua non, would be to reconstitute chains of replication. Putting together these claims, art 124 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">history is a vastly removed or alienated version of what we ordinarily and auto- matically do in interpreting the familiar marks of our immediate culture; con- versely, to recapture our culture as a culture-produced, reproduced, and varied-we must become its archaeologists. IV When we cannot observe the whole closed sequence or cycle of pro- duction itself-as we can experimentally (for instance, in laboratory study of chimpanzees or children scribbling) and, more important, with ourselves (we can see our own images)-it will be very difficult to identify the canonical chain of replications. Two unavoidable features of replication are responsible for this cen- tral problem of symbolism. First, if it is a material artifact at all each variant in a chain is necessarily distinguished spatially and temporally from preceding and following variants. In theory there is no limit to the span of space or lag of time that might separate two variants. What we can call the interpreter's "archaeological survey" would have to be extremely comprehensive to pick up all the variants. In general, as Freud made abundantly clear, the archaeological resolution an interpreter requires to inter- pret symbols is not necessarily deep and specific enough. Second, insofar as some features of a pattern of marks are reproduced in suc- ceeding variants, for whatever purpose, they may become inextricably incorpo- rated-drawn over or built into the latest variant. And insofar as some features are not reproduced in later variants, they may be abandoned or destroyed. The interpreter is left archaeologically with a single pattern that is really at one and the same time a complex filtering and palimpsest of many variations-and the garbage of the studio contains a good deal of what he would like to know.36 At the beginning I noted that some paleolithic art presents special features that make it a useful case for analysis. Because the paleolithic engraver was using a subtractive technology, removing matter from a surface with his gouging fingers or an incising tool rather than adding to it,37 he could not easily change or erase his work. And because for several reasons we believe he was working solely in the restricted confines of the cave, his productions accumulate more or less in one place. We can therefore watch a chain of replications piling up as an enormous palimpsest of variants that potentially has an internal stratigraphy all the way back to the initial episode of seeing-as and disambiguation. If images are produced in the way the general account suggests, then in favorable contexts there should be archaeological evidence of this; and conversely, it is this "archaeological evidence" interpreters use in determining whether any pattern is an image, what it is an image of, and so forth-reconstituting the replication of seeing-as as having been produced as such. Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 125</page><page sequence="16">V If a trace of an origin was preserved at all, then the archaeological record should contain graphic patterns that 1) are "morphologically indiscer- nible"-Danto's neat term38 from patterns produced nonrepresentationally; 2) are nonetheless capable of supporting seeing-as; and 3) were determinably rep- licated for the seeing-as rather than for any nonrepresentational purpose (or lack of purpose). How do the Aurignacian engravings hold up when these simple tests are applied? We can best explore the grounds for our powerful conviction that in exam- ining these "outlines" we are indeed examining images by trying to suppress seeing-as as much as possible. Any familiar art-school technique will do the trick. Examine the pattern of marks with one eye or through a peephole, with half- focused eyes, or with foveal focus on a point somewhat to the right or the left of the pattern. Seeing the outlines as marks in this way shows them to be nearly straight lines and simple C curves, often doubled or repeated in a rhythmic series. Block 16 from La Ferrassie (fig. 2) has eight parallel, short, nearly straight lines in two sets, with the inner lines in each set touching at one end, and two "con- necting" lines at right angles to and between the sets. Seen in this way, they are morphologically indiscernible from anything produced in the earlier history of mark making by incising aimlessly, rhythmically, or with a nonrepresentational interest in simple pattern, balance, and direction, like some scratchings on 0Mous- terian (Neanderthal) artifacts.39 Our first test is satisfied: the marks have nio inherent features dramatically distinguishing them. Yet the marks can certainly support a minimal episode of seeing-as. We know from the past history of interpretation itself that an interpreter can see the lines as (say) the legs and underbelly of an animal. The second test is satisfied. Although the marks therefore could be emergent inaugural images, what counts as evidence, finally, that they were produced for seeing-as, that they were in fact images? This is a much trickier point. The general account states that in image making thing-resemblances must be held constant while nonresemblances can be indifferently substituted or even eliminated throughout a chain of replications, for marks are being replicated for thing-resemblance as such. Moreover, the constancy of thing-resemblance in rep- lication can be independent of just those particular features initially seen as a thing: the resemblant features are not being replicated as just those features, for what- ever purpose, but again, only for their thing-resemblance, which could be obtained through other features. These requirements of the general analysis imply that there should be different kinds and rates of variation for resemblant and for nonresemblant features of the marks. Specifically, first, in replication nonresemblant features do not change in continuous correlation with the resem- blant and may even be differentiated and eliminated (barring some considera- 126 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="17">tions to be taken up later), ultimately leaving "image" against "ground," and second, resemblant features should survive (to some limit) a variety of transla- tions in medium or technique.40 A concise if metaphorical way of putting the point is simply that in replication the image is detached from nonimage. We should be able to identify this archaeologically. Again, the Aurignacian engravings seem to satisfy the kinds of expectations of the third test. First, in any one variant, like Block 16 from La Ferrassie (fig. 2), what we could take as the resemblant features are visibly isolated from other mark- ings, like the various strokes and punctuations. Furthermore, the whole of any single mark in the "image" group can be seen as simply and coherently resem- blant: the full curve of the line is "continuously correlated" with the curve of the animal's belly.4' Second, across or among variants of Aurignacian engraving on blocks, the lines resembling (say) a quadruped are maintained more or less invari- antly-whether incised on the single Block 16 from La Ferrassie (fig. 2), painted across the two joining blocks from the Abri Blanchard (fig. 3), or gouged and hammered out on the block from Belcayre (fig. If). These marks are evidently being replicated for the quadruped-resemblance (shape and perhaps color), evi- dently in these cases indifferent (to some limit) to dimensionality or depth of mark, to position on a surface in relation to its edges, to scale, and so forth (these nonresemblant features of the mark being indifferently substitutable across vari- ants). Resemblance survives translations that nonresemblance does not. In sum, despite their morphological indiscernibility as marks from many other marks, we are entitled to describe the Aurignacian outline engravings as inaugural images-for their particular morphology in replication can be most simply and comprehensively explained (and best predicted) as having been pro- duced in the replication of marks for thing-resemblance as such. We have arrived here at (a sketch of) a completely objective, non- or pre- conventionalist means of identifying an image as an image. However, the logical consistency of the demonstration has been obtained at a high price-although no higher a price than is paid in all interpretation. For one thing, I have assumed all the Aurignacian engravings to be variants in a single network or chain of repli- cations. Although this assumption may be archaeologically plausible-for the blocks come from the same small region at broadly the same time and are tech- nically and stylistically quite similar42-it was not established independently. Worse, at a crucial point I have relied on the recognizability of the object to us- namely, in pointing to the differential variation of resemblant and nonresemblant features. Surely, you might say, we could not classify features as resembling or not resembling a particular object at all unless we already assumed an image, although this is precisely what we are trying to establish we are entitled to assume about the marks (morphologically indiscernible from nonimage) in the first place. Remember, however, that if we accept the critique of simple mimetic theories of representation, thing-resemblance as such is often independent of and certainly Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 127</page><page sequence="18">not sufficient for depiction. Our tests have to show which conceivable thing- resemblances of a mark also depict (that is, were replicated for their resemblance). We do not assume an image to get at relevant thing-resemblance, but we assume this or that thing-resemblance to get at the image. Since we cannot observe the whole chain of replications all the way back to the initial moment of seeing-as, we must assume our judgment of relevant resemblance to be identical with the seeing-as that actually produced the chain. The consistency of our result, com- prehensively accounting for the whole structure of variation we observe, is indeed our only evidence that we have succeeded. But on my analysis this is the necessary fate of interpretation. VI With some minimal idea of how we go about identifying an image as an image, let us turn to the longer and more complex chains of replication in which images are actually embedded if the whole process of producing them is preserved and if, as is usual, image making as such is not the only concern of the person we might now and for this very reason call the artist. I take as my example here the engraved and painted cave at Gargas near Aventignan in the French Pyrenees, datable on the best evidence to the Solutrean period, about 20,000 B.C.43 With the exception of the famous hand stencils in the cave and a few paint- ings of animals (thought by some authorities to be later than the engravings), all of the marks in Gargas were produced subtractively. Barring some unfortunate vandalism by modern tourists and some decay, all variations have been preserved and/or absorbed in any later variations in the chain(s) of replication. The cave contains many "digital flutings" made with three, four, or five fin- gers held together and sluiced through the soft clay (Montmilch; fig. 8). The flut- ings often meander quite far with little modification in the direction or pressure of the line. However, a few are curved, limited, or terminated in a way that would support the seeing-as of a fragmentary outline. As one excavator says, "Some of them suggest animal figures, or offer a striking design."44 Curves made with one finger only are more various and complex than the polydigital curves (fig. 9). Many of them seem to be variations on one particular initial moment of seeing-as, a particular form as it were filtered out of the many forms produced in polydigital tracing-namely, a double S curve drawn horizon- tally (left/right) or vertically (up/down). Drawn vertically, the S curve can be seen as the out-curving horns, forehead, muzzle, and neck of a bison (fig. 10a);45 drawn horizontally, the S curve can be seen as the out-curving horns, humped back, and rising tail or descending hindquarters of a bison (fig. 10b).46 These curves can be repeated in the whole or in part of their length to give two horns, and so forth. Moreover, two double S curves can be placed at oblique or right 128 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="19">FIGURE 8 (left).

A few additional dots or strokes flesh out the basic outline (fig. l0g).5' All of these details-since they are just holes or strokes-are in themselves morpho- logically indiscernible as marks from various finger marks embedded in the poly- digital meanders. More elaborate images (e.g., fig. 11) are engraved rather than traced further in the cave and may possibly represent a further stage in the accumulating palimpsest of replications.52 On one engraved panel (fig. 12),53 several animal heads have been extracted; particularly around the turn of the muzzle and mouth, the lines often falter and skip, as if the engraver were proceeding slowly, changing his mind, or testing his direction. Series of parallel hatches and other longer, single lines lie beneath or above many of these images, but occasionally they have been caught up in the image as part of the outline. In fact, a very large percentage of all the lines in the panels can be brought into association with one Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 129</page><page sequence="20">b. a.

In the chamber of the cave known as the "Camarin," many quite finely detailed images are associated with numerous other apparently nonrepresentational marks, including animal scratches. In many cases the line is firm and subtly modulated, particularly in the "Panel of Mammoths" and "La Pierre Noire" (fig. 13),54 containing at least three nearly complete outlines of whole figures as well as several fragmentary outlines. What are we to make of a tangle like the "Panel of Mammoths" or many comparable clusters? Although it is often thought to occur in paleolithic art and can, I think, be identified in some later caves, completely random superimposition- where the later artist takes no account of the work of the earlier-cannot explain some striking features of the palimpsests in Gargas. In Gargas, two or more images may depend upon a single shared line. Both representational and non- representational forms are quite clearly "filled in" by hatchings or marked around by short series of strokes. The outlines of two or more images are fitted into each other. The whole palimpsest "spreads out," isolating image from nonimage (to some degree) and separating different individual images. Later lines modulate the underlying forms in regular ways, taking nonimage into image, or, for estab- lished images, taking the form (in a series of re- or over-markings) in the direction of greater completion, detail, modulation, and so forth. Although some of these formal structures could be produced fortuitously in completely random super- imposition, we could not predict the regular repetition of all of these few struc- tures.55 At Gargas, superimposition of image on nonimage, nonimage on image, and so on, seems to be taking place within a single system or chain of replications or very closely related chains. Furthermore, the palimpsests exhibit a morphology predictable only if the later artist were taking account of earlier marks and pro- ducing the palimpsest as such.56 The artist takes account of his taking account of earlier marks, ad infinitum throughout a chain of replications. This finding is quite compatible with whatever empirical determinations might be made about the absolute chronology of superimposition, a question that often bogs down in inconclusive debate about the actual time lag between the production of variants. There is necessarily some lag between variants, but whether it is five minutes or five hundred years is really less consequential for interpretation than whether the variants belong to a single chain or closely related chains of replication or to entirely unrelated chains. If they belong to a single chain, whatever the lag the producers are taking account of past work and the accumulation as such; if they are unrelated, whatever the lag, this taking account does not occur. Why, then, are nonimage elements, "early" minimal or fragmentary outlines, and "later" complete, detailed, modulated, and differentiated images produced in complex palimpsests, exhibiting the constant use and re-use of forms and for- mats of many different "logical ages" in the chains of replication?

Some elements of a solution can be derived straightforwardly from our gen- eral analysis of image making. We cannot assume that the artist wasjust producing images, derived from the nonimage that happens to be preserved. Those features of a pattern not implicated in an image may perfectly well have a variety of other, nonrepresentational semantic values. (If we accept Peirce's analysis of pictures as "hypoicons," then they necessarily have other values.) In a single pattern, several referential systems could be operating simultaneously: a notation may be com- menting upon or labeling an image, an image may be an element in a heraldry, and so forth. Alexander Marshack's analysis of the alterations, re-use, and over- marking of paleolithic images by nonimage features strongly suggests the non- image elements were significant-produced nonrandomly as such, regularly repeated and varied in a few limited formats. Sometimes the strokes and marks seem to lead the viewer from one cluster of marks to another or signify points of transition; they could be signposts of sorts. They might even have semantic value as a notation accompanying the images-perhaps to be paralleled with the puz- 132 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="23">zling symbolism of the famous red, black, and white hand stencils also produced in the cave at Gargas, or as a symbolism denoting the presence of certain people, the performance of certain activities, and so forth, or even as a kind of signature, caption, or "audience response." This research has been widely publicized and can be pursued in the literature.57 A meaningful representation does not always and only derive from, replicate, and vary a ground of absolutely meaningless stuff (lumps, marks, sound waves), but also derives from, replicates, and varies a ground with other meanings. For images, the depictive mark derives from seeing-as in relation to a nonimage mark, that is, a mark that has not already been interpreted and replicated as an image of a particular object or even has been so interpreted unbeknownst to a later interpreter. Specifically and positively, the "nonimage" mark may be a naturally produced mark, a semantically meaningless man-made mark (such as an incision made to test the cutting power of a tool), a semantically meaningful but nonrepre- sentational mark, and so forth. Similarly, semantically meaningful nonrepresen- tational graphics and glyphs like heraldic emblems or notations might derive from a context that is nongraphic or nonglyphic in terms of the constitutive cri- teria of those representational schemes. FIGURE 12. Incised panel with bovids, horses, and mammoth (not shown), in Le Baldaquin, cave of Gargas (line drawing after original shows left two-thirds of panel). Reprinted from Barriere, L'Art parietal, fig. 30. Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 133</page><page sequence="24">If we could completely interpret the palimpsest at every level-requiring penetrating analyses of notation, decoration, and so on, in addition to an analysis of images-then all marks might be seen to be necessary in replication and for "total signification": the palimpsest as such is the sum, a figurative system of aston- ishing range. The replication of the system as a whole will exhibit a complex structure of variation not entirely predictable by the replicatory requirements or trajectory of any one embedded representational scheme. For instance, although in the replication of images the nonimage elements might "fade out," precisely those nonimage elements might be required in the replication of a nonrepresen- tational scheme-a notation, "decorative" or heraldic design, and so forth. The figurative system of image and nonimage may be a necessary feature of production in a final sense as well, a sense more directly relevant to image making as such than our recognition that nonimage marks might be representational. To produce an image is to hold thing-resemblance constant throughout a chain of replications. But this is only the most minimal characteristic of many chains in which marks depict an object: most chains have further characteristics. For one thing, chains of replication do not merely establish one stable image. In an actual chain, thing-resemblance need not be held constant forever once an image has been established but can be varied considerably. Inaugural images become in turn the ground for further seeing-as. The chain of replications will montage over time into a new image (that is, marks with thing-resemblances pre- served as such and derived from but not judged as identical to initial things resemblances). Throughout this potentially continuous process of replication of the same and into a different image, the balance of resemblant and nonresem- blant features is continuously shifting. For example, even in the replication of the same image (a chain of the canonical form), nonresemblant features are indiffer- ently substitutable and the resemblant features may change as long as their thing- resemblance is judged to be constant. And in the establishment of a new image, the resemblant features of the old may become nonresemblant in the new and the new may use nonresemblant features of the old as resemblant. Of course, if at any point after the image is established in a chain of the canonical form, no thing-resemblances are seen in and preserved as such in a further canonical chain, then the whole pattern of marks reverts to nonimage. In sum, if replication goes further than simply the continuous reproduction of the same image by iden- tical marks (which would appear to be materially impossible), and whatever the further work might be (leading to a new image or to none at all), then it will nec- essarily and constantly generate nonimage. In a complex palimpsest, nonimage never completely falls away because the images themselves are continually varying in replication, moving away from an initial moment of seeing-as but (allowing a teleological phrasing) moving towards other moments of seeing-as, re-finding the founding possibility of nonimage at every turn. (Turn of the line, turn of the page .. .) Although I will not try to 134 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="25">FIGURE 13.

Reprinted from ibid., fig. r,~~~~~~~~~~ 9 demonstrate this here, it is probably not too much to suppose that the artist ulti- mately takes control of what is initially presented simply as an inherent and nec- essary fact of making marks. Just as seeing-as is an automatic response of the perceptual system to a certain pattern of marks, so too, of course, is not seeing- as-and both processes can be recognized as such, preserved, and varied in rep- lication. The image maker is necessarily master of both; it is the art historian- all too often seeker after iconological meaning or the securities of signification- who prejudices the one over the other. It may seem odd to speak of nonimage or not seeing-as as a vital positive ele- ment of image making with vivid direct consequences. Nonimage is fundamen- tally implicated in image at many levels; it is the most immediate and most impor- tant context of the image. It is required to establish image, as the very marks to be seen-as and as part of the interpreter's very test that thing-resemblance has in Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 135</page><page sequence="26">fact been produced as such. It is the unavoidable by-product of replicating the image. It is constitutive of other symbolic schemes with which image is ordinarily (and perhaps necessarily) associated. It is the very ground or possibility for change in the image, or, at the limit, for its decay altogether. In fact, nonimage is simply mark making as such-historically of far greater antiquity and with far broader functional application and cultural consequence than the particular technology of depiction I have looked at here. Image making is something we do with marks we have made, but the marks have a life of their own: they assert themselves literally and in all their intractable materiality at every turn. The fun- damental and problematic truth for the production and interpretation of images is simply that it is only the mark that is literally and really there. VII We have, I think, come some distance. As a pattern that can be taken by different interpreters as being representational or not and as having the same or different objects, an image certainly requires interpretation under the consti- tutive and specific resemblance criteria-that is, in a particular conventional con- text. A good deal has been made of conventions and contexts in modern art history. In fact, conventions and contexts seem to be the stuff of history itself- painting a Virgin in the fifteenth century, exhibiting a pile of felt in downtown New York, or carving a bone in the last Ice Age. But as the very stuff of history, conventions and contexts cannot easily be made into the explanation for or the grounds of history. Here we experience puzzling regresses and crippling circular- ities. These paradoxes can be swept under the rug: or, in the modern urge to describe conventions and contexts completely and accurately, their resolution can be indefinitely postponed. What might be called a preconventionalist and precontextualist account seems to be required to show why conventions and contexts would ever have the configurations they do. I have offered only a sketch of a small element of such an account. We have seen that images are generated in the replication of seeing-as as such, a process that, at least inaugurally, can occur automatically and involun- tarily and-although I did not stress this element of my analysis-in the total absence of a preexisting cultural or social structure. In fact, when pressed for their hard cash analytic value, conventions and contexts simply amount to the replication of seeing-as. But in saying this, we have not forgotten about history in a reckless embrace of the image as beyond constraint, before deliberation, or above prediction, as somehow emptied into history by the inexplicable transcen- dental authorities going by various names in our discipline-genius, creativity, or what-have-you. As I have stressed, the interpretation of an image as this partic- ular image is the archaeology of its replication-and an adequate archaeology is 136 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="27">an historical project par excellence. Replication begins from a specific and from our point of view possibly a determinable point and has a specific and determin- able trajectory. What more could an historian want? Certainly there is much more. With tremendous labor and good luck in our archaeology we could determine that we have before us an image of a particular object; on my analysis this determination is totally equivalent to describing it con- ventionally and contextually. But we could still wonder why this image is there at all. We could, in other words, justifiably want an account of replication itself, the on-going human ambition to make and to remake the world as perception de- livers it, to preserve what we perceive or to elaborate, revise, reverse, or suppress it, to repeat ourselves with accruing differences: in short, the human ambition- or, more properly on my analysis, the human fate-to have history. But that is another question, not unhistorical in itself. Notes I am grateful to the Society of Fellows, Harvard University, the J. Paul Getty Trust, and the Department of History of Art, University of California at Berkeley, for sup- port.

Footnotes have been added to give references and to clarify and inflect the bald discussion. They are not intended to be comprehensive. Moreover, as many of them simply tie the text to some context and, in defending certain remarks, lead into matters that cannot pos- sibly be taken up in detail here, they can-and probably should-be skipped on an initial reading. 1.

As we will see, it may be possible to say something about the morphology of the origins of image making without necessarily assuming we have said all there is to say about paleolithic origins as such. 7.

Leroi-Gourhan, Treasures, 206, writes that the "starting point of [the] stylistic evolution [of paleolithic art from the Aurignacian through the Magdalenian] is not a primitive realism-this latter idea was a pure invention by nineteenth-century prehistorians-but a mode of representation that focuses first on the traits that par- ticularize an animal species, disregarding the rest." We can only speculate why the engraver considered a certain kind of outline, a profile silhouette, to "particularize" in this sense. In Leroi-Gourhan's account, image making derives from the particular- izing elaboration of a foundational dorsal line, more or less similar in all early engrav- ings. Alternatively, as we will see in more detail, different "parts" of animals were likely to have been perceived in different clusters of lines. There is no reason to expect that we should be able to attach labels from our natural language(s) to these "parts," nor that they were metonymically related to any "wholes." They could be no more and no less than the depiction of unnamed bits, patches, and fragments of the world. 16. Delluc and Delluc, "Les Manifestations graphiques," passim. I illustrate block 11 from Abri Blanchard, a typical example; see ibid., 243-47 and figs. 19-21. The identifica- tion of these marks as female genitals has been challenged. Peter J. Ucko and Andr~e Rosenfeld, "Anthropomorphic Representations in Palaeolithic Art," Actas del Sympo- sium Internacional de Arte Prehistoric6 (Santander, 1972), 149-211, omitted the marks from their catalogue; Brigitte Delluc and Gilles Delluc, "De l'empreinte au signe," Histoire et archgologie 90 (1985): 56-62, have suggested some of the marks may depict footprints (I owe the reference to P.J. Ucko). For this question and others, see also Paul G. Bahn, "No Sex Please, We're Aurignacians," Rock Art Research 4 (1986): 99- 120, with comments by several students of paleolithic representation. The role of the female (feminine) and of the erotic (or erotic imagery) in paleolithic art has, needless to say, been the subject of considerable debate and speculation; important statements include Desmond Collins and John Onians, "The Origins of Art," Art History 1 (1978): 1-25; A.D. Stoliar, "On the Sociohistorical Decoding of Upper Paleolithic Female Signs," Soviet Anthropology and Archaeology 16, no. 2 (1977-78): 37-77; Henri Delporte, L'Image de lafemme dans Iart prehistorique (Paris, 1979). 17. For instance, Leroi-Gourhan, Treasures, 150, 206, has argued that the "thematic" rela- tion or equation between "vulvae and dots" persists throughout the paleolithic period and that the Aurignacian material gives first evidence of this "figurative system." 18. Ibid., fig. 286; Atlas, 164-66. On stylistic grounds (Leroi-Gourhan's Style II), the image is generally assigned to the Lower Solutrean, c. 20,000 B.C. For this and other guides to dating, see Naber, et al., L'Art palgolithique, 107-8; and Atlas, 164-66. 19. Atlas provides extended entries on the French caves. In a magnificent cooperative scientific endeavor, French and Spanish prehistorians have produced comprehensive publication and detailed technical, formal (morphological and compositional), and Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 139</page><page sequence="30">contextual studies of some of the Magdalenian caves, as individual wholes. Although these caves and this work are not discussed in the remainder of this paper, I have learned from them tremendously. See, for example, Arlette Leroi-Gourhan, et al., Lascaux inconnu, Gallia Prehistoire, suppl. no. 12 (Paris, 1979); Denis Vialou, L'Art parietal en Ariege magdalenienne, Memoire de la Laboratoire de Paleontologie Humaine et de Prehistoire, no. 13, 3 vols. (Paris, 1981); his "Niaux, une construction symbolique magdalenienne exemplaire," Ars Praehistorica 1 (1982): 19-45, contains good instances of the principal methods. A special issue of L'Anthropologie, 88, no. 4 (1984), contains fundamental methodological articles by Vialou, Marshack, Delluc and Delluc, and others. 20. On "density," see primarily Goodman, Languages of Art, 127-76. Helpful expositions and elaborations are provided by David Carrier, "A Reading of Goodman on Repre- sentation," The Monist 58 (1974): 269-84; Geoffrey Hellman, "Symbol Systems and Artistic Styles," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 35 (1977): 279-92; Catherine Z. Elgin, With Reference to Reference (Indianapolis, 1983), 97-126. Although density may not be a defining feature of representation (or of representational variables like line and color), it is surely one of its most common and striking qualities. In "Origins of Image Making," I was tempted to use it as the test of representationality. Among useful extensions of Goodman's work, see particularly Kent Bach, "Part of What a Picture Is," British Journal of Aesthetics 10 (1970): 119-37 ("continuous correlation"); John G. Bennett, "Depiction and Convention," The Monist 58 (1974): 255-68 (conven- tionality in a semiotic analysis of representation); Jennifer Todd, "The Roots of Pic- torial Reference," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 39 (1980-81): 47-57 (social constraints on choice of symbol systems). However, I believe this direction of analysis ultimately fails to provide room for invariances of human perception in the produc- tion and reproduction of pictures, and it is exposed as well to serious internal or logical objections. See, for instance, Anthony Savile, "Nelson Goodman's 'Languages of Art': A Study,'journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 11 (1971): 3-27; Paul Ziff, "Goodman's Languages of Art," Philosophical Review 80 (1971): 509-15; Richard Wollheim, "Nelson Goodman's Languages of Art," in his On Art and the Mind (Cambridge, 1974), 290-314; Kendall Walton, "Are Representations Symbols?" The Monist 58 (1974): 236-54; Jenefer Robinson, "Some Remarks on Goodman's Language Theory of Pictures," British Journal of Aesthetics 19 (1979): 63-75. See also below, notes 22, 23, 31, 34. I take it that working out a naturalistic (non- or pre-relativistic, -semiotic, and -convention- alist) account of representation, such as the one adopted here, has fundamental con- sequences for art historical practice. It must have clear advantages over the competition-such as Goodman or any simple illusion theories. 21. Although I am primarily interested in a theoretical difficulty with this narrative, before taking up this matter it is appropriate here to enter some historical caveats. First, extremely early dates are available for two-dimensional images outside the Franco-Cantabrian area and not associated with the Aurignacian culture as defined there. Several blocks with drawings of animal figures from Apollo XI Cave, Namibia (W. E. Wendt, "Art mobilier aus der Apollo 11 Grotte in Sud-West-Afrika," Acta Praehis- torica et Archaeologica 5 [1974]: 1-42; J. D. Lewis-Williams, The Rock Art of Southern Africa [Cambridge, 1983], figs. 42-43; Alex R. Willcox, The Rock Art of Africa [New York, 1984], 231-37), can be dated securely to c. 21,000 B.C., if associated with the overlying stratigraphic layer, and possibly as early as 29,500 B.C. (Anne I. Thackeray, "Dating the Rock Art of Southern Africa," in J. D. Lewis-Williams, ed., New Approaches to Southern African Rock Art, Goodwin Series no.4 [Cape Town, 1983], 21-26). Emmanuel 140 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="31">Anati, "Reply to Davis," Current Anthropology 27 (1986): 202, has suggested that these blocks are "certainly not the earliest of a sequence," although no earlier material has yet been found and Anati does not specify his criteria for the "refinement" and "sophistication" of the drawings (paintings?). Other two-dimensional graphic produc- tions are known from early contexts elsewhere in the world, most notably in Australia, where the Koonalda Cave markings date as early as 22,000 B.C. (see various treatments in Peter J. Ucko, ed., Form in Indigenous Art [London, 1977]), and the lower section of the pecked frieze at the Early Man Shelter in North Queensland has been assigned archaeologically to "around or before 13,000 years ago"; Andree Rosenfeld, David Horton, and John Winter, Early Man in North Queensland (Canberra, 1981), 33. How- ever, the early Australian material is not unambiguously representational by the intu- itive standards I have adopted so far. Although the marks may be "maps" or some other kind of nonrepresentational sign, they have no recognizable status as images for us at the moment. Nonetheless, we will certainly need to refine our methods for set- tling the question less casually. Here, I will not attempt to determine whether the slightly later southern African or other early images elsewhere (as in northeastern Africa: Whitney Davis, "The Earliest Art in the Nile Valley," in Lech Krzyzaniak, ed., The Origins and Development of Early Food-Producing Cultures in Northeastern Africa [Poznan, Poland, 1985], 81-94) could be descended genetically from the Aurignacian, the Aurignacian then to be regarded as the origin of line drawing as we know it. It is enough to say that the Aurignacian blocks are the earliest known images in this medium, that is, line applied to or removed from a plane surface. Second, however, equally early or even earlier dates have been established for three-dimensional "sculptural" imagery. The early ivory figurines from Vogelherd (Gustav Riek, "Altsteinzeit Kulturen am Vogelherd bei Stetten ob Lontal [Wurtem- berg]," Jahrbuch fur prahistorische und ethnographische Kunst [1932-33]: 1-26; Leroi- Gourhan, Treasures, 89; Marshack, Roots of Civilization, 249-56 and fig. 129) make use of two kinds of representation, the lump of matter itself representing the overall shape of the animal and lines incised on the worked lump two-dimensionally representing hair or other features. These incisions could be included in our repertory of two- dimensional imagery, and the figurines with the earliest images as such. Both the fig- urines and the incisions on figurines and blocks are documents of Aurignacian depic- tion, but clearly we must still ask about its origins in marks or lumps. For the sake of simplicity, my detailed considerations later in this paper will be confined to marks. However, the account could be applied straightforwardly to lumps or to any other medium. Third, it may be that two-dimensional images of the Aurignacian could be a simple genetic continuation of a two-dimensional image-making tradition developed far earlier in another medium that has not been preserved. Since monkeys and apes apparently do not produce images (see Davis, "Origins of Image Making," 197; and compare David Premack, "Putting a Face Together," Science 188, no.4185 [1975]: 228- 36), these ur-images would have had to have been produced by hominids like Homo erectus or H. sapiens neanderthalensis. Let us be quite clear about the status of this pos- sibility in our narratives. Certainly images could have been produced in wet sand, soft clay, or grease paint or tattooing on the body (see Francois Bordes, "Sur l'usage prob- able de la peinture corporelle dans certaines tribus mousteriennes," Bulletin de la Sociztg Prehistorique Francaise [1952]: 169-71; Gordon W. Hewes, "Reply to Davis," Current Anthropology 27 [1986]: 204). In itself, this does not establish that the Aurignacian engravings descended genetically from such images-in what I will later (section III) Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 141</page><page sequence="32">describe as a "chain of replications." In the account I favor, taking the first image as an image depended crucially on the physical character of the first medium itself and on a particular perception of it-conditions that might or might not be generalizable to any other media in any later productions. Even if an image maker used the same tools and motions, the transfer from one medium to another might have eradicated the image; at each significant shift the producer can fail to take the new mark as an image. In replication, genetic continuity of the image is not guaranteed. Therefore to assert that images have been produced before is not enough to show why we have these particular images before us. Of course, if a particular mark were taken to be (still) an image after transferring it from one surface to another or varying how it was produced, we would then have to ask about the origin of making that image in the very first of its contexts of pro- duction and perception. Aurignacian engravings could stand somewhere far down the line in a genetic sequence. However, there is really no need to venture this speculation at all (although it figures in many mythologies about humanness, positing vast reaches of prehistoric, prehuman time, mentioned but never described, as the causal context of our humanity). The Aurignacian engravings conform to what an explicit formal definition predicts the "first" images in a particular chain of replications should be like (Davis, "Origins of Image Making"), a moment that is archaeologically (formally and contextually) identifiable although it occurs throughout history in both phylo- and onto- genesis (Davis, "More on the Origins and Originality of Images"). I conclude this long footnote by stating, then, that it is not merely out of archae- ological parochialism or even archaeological necessity that I focus on Aurignacian material as evidence of origins. 22. The classic arguments can be found in Goodman, Languages of Art, 3-43; and "Seven Strictures on Similarity," in his Problems and Projects (Indianapolis, 1972), 437-46. The upshot is that "resemblance is always asserted or assumed relative to a variable pur- pose or point" (David Novitz, "Pictures, Fiction, and Resemblance," British Journal of Aesthetics 22 [1982]: 227); here, resemblance is within representation. But resemblance will certainly figure in my account, and can be built in to various suitably inflected analyses: see, from various points of view, the arguments of James Q. Knowlton, "On the Definition of 'Picture,"'AV Communication Review 14 (1961): 157-83; James W. Manns, "Representation, Relativism and Resemblance," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 11 (1971): 281-87; Robert Schwartz, "Representation and Resemblance," Philosophical Forum 5 (1980): 499-512; and a considerable literature in the study of sign language and of "mental images." In the remainder of this paper, I will assume a sensitivity to much of this writing but will not explicitly outline or address it further. 23. See Goodman, Languages of Art, 159-64 (who recognizes the roughness of the distinc- tion); David K. Lewis, "Analog and Digital," Nous 5 (1971): 321-27; John Haugeland, "Analog and Analog," Philosophical Topics 12 (1981): 213-25. The (intelligibility of) the distinction is fundamental to the claim-gaining popularity in art history-that the image-interpreting and text-interpreting capacities of human beings are cognitively and neuropsychologically distinct, and that models and metaphors useful for the one should not be applied to the other. The experimental and philosophical consideora- tions are neatly reviewed by Roger Brown and Richard J. Herrnstein, "Icons and Images," in Ned Block, ed., Imagery (Cambridge, Mass., 1981), 19-49; Robert Schwartz, "Imagery: There's More to It Than Meets the Eye," in Block, ed., Imagery, 109-30; Ned Block, "Mental Pictures and Cognitive Science," Philosophical Review 92 (1983): 499-541.

Arthur C. Danto, The Transfiguration of the Commonplace (New York, 1981). See below, note 38. 25. This condition clearly rules out a mark in which a thing-resemblance denotes, but not that particular thing it resembles. However, it does not imply that there are no fur- ther interesting and important resemblances, for example, between features of the mark and features of other marks. As we will see, mark-to-object "denotational resemblance" is actually a specialized function of mark-to-mark resemblances or replications. 26. Since I have indulged semiotic language here to some extent (and will register my distress with it only later), let me go all the way. In Peircean language, an image is not a "pure" iconic sign, for it cannot iconically exhibit the fact that it is a sign and that particular relations of iconic resemblance to an object also signify that object (see Arthur W. Burks, "Icon, Index, and Symbol," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 9 [1949]: 673-89; and Arthur K. Bierman, "That There Are No Iconic Signs ...," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 23 [1962]: 243-49, for full discussion in Peircean terminology). For this reason, as A.J. Ayer notes (The Origins of Pragmatism [San Francisco, 1968], 140), no actual sign could be a pure icon but is rather what Peirce sometimes termed a "hypoicon," a sign incorporating iconic resemblances spec- ified "symbolically" as signifying what they resemble as well as other sign relations not immediately relevant to its iconic signification (for instance, it is an index of the pro- cedures used to manufacture it and a symbol that someone had an intention so to manufacture it). See further Gary Schapiro, "Intention and Interpretation in Art: A Semiotic Analysis,"Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 33 (1974): 33-42. 27. Ayer, Origins of Pragmatism, 130. 28.

See Wollheim, Art and Its Objects, 104-5. 32. In a Gricean account, a picture maker would in or by a picture try to get a picture viewer to recognize the maker's intention that the viewer have a certain response. Although I have never seen the account rigorously formulated for pictures-perhaps it cannot be formulated?-something like it seems central to art historians' talk about pictures and viewers. See H. P. Grice, "Meaning," Philosophical Review 66 (1957): 377- 88; and "Utterer's Meaning, Sentence-Meaning, and Word-Meaning," Foundations of Language 4 (1968): 225-42; Stephen Schiffer, Meaning (Oxford, 1972). I am very sym- pathetic to the Gricean effort to (re)construct semantic notions from nonsemantic primitives. However, the Griceans cannot seem to pull themselves up by their boot- straps over what Neil Tennant calls the "Gricean hump," the emergence of intentions and meanings in representation and communication ("Intentionality, Syntactic Struc- ture and the Evolution of Language," in Christopher Hookway, ed., Minds, Machines and Evolution [Cambridge, 1984], 73-103). The circularity and/or regress of an inde- pendent determination of speaker's "intention" to mean something is nicely expressed by J. I. Biro, "Intentionalism and the Theory of Meaning," The Monist 62 (1979): 238- 58, although Grice himself, "Meaning Revisited," in N. V. Smith, ed., Mutual Knowledge (London, 1982), 223-43, seems untroubled. In recent work, Dan Sperber and Replication and Depiction in Paleolithic Art 143</page><page sequence="34">Deirdre Wilson have claimed to break out of the circularity or cut the regress by ana- lyzing (neo-Gricean) conversational standards sufficient for reasonable comprehen- sion (in the absence of full "mutual knowledge"); Relevance: Cognition and Communication (Cambridge, Mass., 1986). John R. Searle's more radical solution-to make the "intention to communicate" dependent on a prior sense of "meaning," that is, the representation of information, rather than the other way around-seems more promising in making fewer assumptions about the sociality and communicativeness of the creatures manipulating representations; "Meaning, Communication, and Rep- resentation," in Richard E. Grandy and Richard Warner, eds., Philosophical Grounds of Rationality: Intentions, Categories, Ends (Oxford, 1986), 209-26. 33. Both similarity and substitutability are relative to a function and to a theory. Replica- tion is a special case of the production of similars and substitutes in which similarity is the grounds for substitutability. One can produce a string of merely substitutable marks without similarity (for example, labeling an entrance for the seeing and the blind) and a string of merely similar marks without substitutability (for example, ner- vously tapping the page with a pencil). A much fuller account of similarity and sub- stitutability in replication is provided in my Seeing Through Culture: The Possibility of a History of Art (forthcoming). 34. See especially James J. Gibson, The Perception of the Visual World (Boston, 1950); and David Marr, Vision: A Computational Investigation (New York, 1982). On seeing-as and his alternative "seeing-in," see Wollheim, Art and Its Objects, 205-26. To my mind, seeing-in is not a unitary, simple perceptual process but a description of what we do when we experience seeing-as and disambiguation in relation to marked surfaces. However, Wollheim's account has many advantages, and I will reserve the option to rewrite elements of my own in its terms. In my use of seeing-as, note: 1) Although writers on representation often tend to do so, the general distinction between ambig- uous stimulus (mark) and erroneous perceptual interpretation (thing) should not be collapsed into the particular distinction between a possible two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional solid. Thinghood must be widely defined to include three- dimensional solids, illuminated surfaces with reflectance gradients (like a shadowed wall), and fields of color (like a patch of sky). 2) A single mark may be seen as two or more different things in successive viewings, or even during successive instants of the same viewing punctuated by a "Gestalt switch" (so-called "ambiguous figures" like the duck/rabbit or other figure/ground "illusions"). This type of ambiguity is not that of seeing-as in my usage, that is, the confusion of a mark with a particular thing. How- ever, the fact that a single mark can support an indefinite number of distinct episodes of seeing-as (duck, then rabbit, then . . .) lies behind the interpreter's need to have historical knowledge of the particular episode inaugurating the production of an image. 3) Ambiguity and error are descriptions of perceptual episode; they are not in the stimulus essentially. 35. In "Origins of Image Making," I offer a formal characterization of these chains, only some of which could ever be images. For other relatively formal accounts of variation in replication, see George Kubler, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things (New Haven, 1962), whose internal "rule of series" I think fails; and David Clarke, Analytical Archaeology, 2nd ed. (New York, 1978). 36. Despite the approach of many archaeologists and art historians, the problem of archaeological resolution is not that of identifying the work of actual individuals in a sequence of artifacts. The interpreter's task, in the face of the two inherent difficulties, 144 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="35">is simply to establish the association between different marks, produced whenever by whomever, within which an episode of image-interpretation (seeing-as, disambigua- tion, recognition, and canonical preservation of thing-resemblance) occurred for interpreters. This is very likely but not necessarily a matter of examining marks pro- duced by one person at one time. 37. For the use of the fingers, see the detailed examination of Robert G. Bednarik, "Pari- etal Finger Markings in Europe and Australia," Rock Art Research 3 (1986): 30-6 1; for the subtractive technologies of incising on bone, rocks, and so on, see Marshack, Roots of Civilization; Delluc and Delluc, "Les Manifestations graphiques"; and an early, under-appreciated work by G.-B.-M. Flamand, Les Pierres 9crites (Hadjrat-Mektoubat): Gravures et inscriptions rupestres du nord-africain (Paris, 1921). 38. Danto, Transfiguration. In this paper I have made considerable use of Danto's powerful device of imagining "morphologically indiscernible" phenomena that are nevertheless psychologically or categorially distinct and discernible in some contexts (say, semantic, aesthetic, or institutional). In his famous argument about the perceptual and aesthetic relevance of our knowledge about the authorships of apparently "indiscernible" orig- inal and forged works of art, Nelson Goodman (Languages of Art, 99-123) seems to suggest that if we are talking about separate artifacts then there are no morphological indiscernibles (no perfect fakes): there is always some feature we could isolate (if we know to look for it) serving to distinguish them. At its core my argument is closer to Danto's than to Goodman's. I focus on a shift in the use of the same artifact (from nonimage to image). However, since an artifact is necessarily found archaeologically in only one of its contexts (say, the semantic, aesthetic, or institutional one), I must look to other artifacts in other contexts for some notion of what it would be like to find or to see our artifact nonsemantically, nonaesthetically, or noninstitutionally. 39. See, for example, Alexander Marshack, "Some Implications of the Paleolithic Sym- bolic Evidence for the Origins of Language," Current Anthropology 17 (1976): 274-81; and for the archaeological problems of this material, Leslie G. Freeman, Lewis R. Binford, and Randall White, "More on the Mousterian: Flaked Bone from Cueva Morin," Current Anthropology 24 (1983): 366-77. 40. The first in a sense includes the second, for indifferent substitutability or eliminability of nonresemblance includes (but is not limited to) the fact that in a translation of technique or medium features once resemblant can become nonresemblant and are therefore as susceptible to substitution or elimination as any initially nonresemblant features. 41. As we will see (section VI), these characteristics of the engraved blocks cannot be found on many of the cave wall panels, where the image is deeply embedded in non- image. To avoid complexity, I do not treat the cave wall panels here, for the blocks may be related to or even derived from them. 42. In "Style and History in Art History," in Margaret W. Conkey and Christine Halstorf, eds., The Uses of Style in Archaeology (Cambridge, forthcoming), I consider style (mark- to-mark resemblance) in part as an interpreter's evidence for the archaeological iden- tification of chains of replication. 43.

It is probable that whether earlier, contemporary, or later, they were not solely derived from the tracings, for then we would expect them to exhibit only the forms and formats of the "later" stages in the replication of digital tracings, from which they were supposedly translated. They have been published and discussed in Leroi-Gourhan's topographical analysis of the cave (Treasures, 307-8), the Atlas (514- 22), and in the comprehensive publication (Barriere, L'Art parietal de Gargas) as a sep- arate set or system of marks and images in themselves. By my terms, this is an analytic convenience. We cannot determine whether the engravers themselves applied a dis- tinction between engraving and digital trace (as we could if they were obviously "ear- lier" and "later" in a chain). In other words, we could be looking at a single network or chain of replications in which the medium and technique of the mark itself (tracing or engraving) was of no consequence compared (say) to its shape, or we could be looking at two self-sufficient but structurally parallel systems (tracing versus engrav- ing). For my purposes here the difference can be set aside. As with tracing, in engraving image emerges palpably from nonimage. 53.

Conversely, in completely random or nonmeaningful superimposition, later marks should overlie the earlier in all kinds of unpredictable ways, since for all intents and purposes the earlier marks are not there. Moreover, we should expect to find regularly repeated formal (morphological and compositional) relations among the later marks themselves or between the later marks and the context, since placement is not being determined by an underlying mark but by other factors. Finally, we should expect to find regularly repeated formal relations among the earlier marks not picked up and repeated by the later. All of these characteristics of the palimpsest as we confront it would count as evidence that earlier and later marks were produced completely inde- pendently. Note that we can investigate questions about the meaningfulness of super- imposition as questions about the morphology, structure, and context of a palimpsest, without knowing in advance which marks are in fact earlier or later (although here we do, of course, have the evidence of literal superimposition to guide us, the literal data are underdetermining, for in a single chain it might be that earlier and later marks never physically touch). 56. Note that his taking account of earlier marks in theory is not enough to establish that he produced the palimpsest as such. The mark maker could produce his later marks on the basis of his experience of earlier marks, but being just the unavoidable by- 146 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="37">product of the fact that he makes unerasable marks, the palimpsest as such may have no interest for him; he could be interested at any given moment only in his latest marks-produced as they are on the basis of past experiences-and the fact that the earlier are still there is of no account. I have no space to present a full demonstration that at Gargas the mode of production requires the mark maker to take account both of earlier marks and the on-going production of a palimpsest of the earlier and his latest marks. The demonstration investigates archaeological expectations about the replication of marks: for example, if the mark maker is interested only in his latest marks, then he should gradually fill up a surface (unavoidably creating a palimpsest), move to another surface, and start there with his latest variants, building a new but developmentally later palimpsest there. At Gargas it seems that the mark maker skipped from surface to surface and returned to previously marked surfaces. 57.
