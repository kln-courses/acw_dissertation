Verse translated by EDNA LIPPMAN LIEF MICHAEL GERSHENZON A History of Young Russia CHAPTER IV TIMOFEI GRANOVSKII 1. World View Granovskii's direct influence ceased long ago. He was not a great thinker, and he did not leave posterity a single one of those ideas that require a decade to be fully understood and become productive. What he wrote is little read, and is read more from respect for his name than from genuine interest. He belongs to history and must be judged historically. If, as we are told (these are Kudriavtsev's words), "the purest instincts of human nature in every soul responded to what he said," we must attribute this effect not so much to the ideas he advanced in his lectures as to his per sonality. There can be no doubt that in any evaluation of Granovskii's influ ence on Russian society, his personal qualities must be assigned a very promi nent place. The innate gentleness, the spiritual refinement, the aesthetic cast of mind that he displayed are great social assets in any time—and Granovskii toiled in the coarse society of the 'forties, which was either mired in material interests or haughtily half-educated, when the cultural impact of such a man as he must have been particularly great. But, this general service aside, a question naturally arises. What place does Granovskii occupy in the history of the evolution of our social consciousness? To answer this question intelligently we must know what he taught, and in what time. He taught, after Hegel, that the history of mankind is a history of its unin terrupted progress toward the supreme moral goal. Thus in his view universal history presents a perfectly coherent picture: in it we study the course of mankind's education as we would a single man's. Conflicts and the train of</page><page sequence="2">160 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE historical events take place according to definite, invariable laws; but it would be a mistake to infer fatalism from the observation of this necessity that reigns in history. These laws are not the ultimate springs of history; their role is aux iliary. They are nothing but outer manifestations of the inner lawfulness im parted to history by the moral progress that is taking place within it. "Over all these laws of historical evolution discovered by science there reigns one su preme—that is, moral—law, in the realization of which consists the ultimate goal of mankind on earth." Thus mankind's aspiration toward the supreme moral goal coincides with nature's lawfulness. The ideal and the real, being and thinking, are identical; subjective spirit and the world develop according to the same law. An individual, a nation, mankind—these are three coordinate spheres in which the supreme moral law is realized. The same organic evolution, the same sequence of stages govern universal history as are observed in the life of a single man. And just as an individual nation exists in an unbroken succes sion of men and generations, so mankind lives a single, integral life in the suc cession of separate nations. More than that, it is precisely through the succes sion of nations that mankind's consecutive evolution toward the great ulti mate goal takes place. Each nation experiences the same phases as an individ ual man: childhood, youth, maturity, and old age, followed by death. Each in its growth develops its own limited, unique idea—which is also its contribu tion to general human culture. Thus one nation succeeds another, and each new nation inherits all the intellectual capital amassed by preceeding genera tions, reworks that inheritance after its own fashion, and in turn passes it on to future generations. Such is the mysterious bond that embraces the life of all mankind, linking nations separate from each other in space and in time. Mankind, like the individual and the nation, is an integral organism animated by a single spirit, and its history is the history of its moral growth. Thus the supreme value of history is that it gives us assurance of the inevitable triumph of good over evil. I hus the history ot mankind is a predetermined process. But this process is predetermined only as regards its general direction and its ultimate end. As for the rest—that is, in all its particular stages—it gives full freedom to the play of forces, aspirations, and passions (personal, class, national, and so on). Man moves inexorably toward his goal, but divine Providence shows him nei ther what road to take nor how much time to spend on the \fray. That is the individual's area of creativity. Here the individual is not a tool, but an inde pendent historical factor in his capacity as a champion or an opponent of the coming historical idea, "and upon him rightfully falls the responsiblity for whole series of events that he evokes or arrests." Thus no man, however hum ble his sphere of activity, is free from the obligation to promote, to the limit of his ability, the realization of the historical law. But he is answerable only for the purity of his intentions and for the energy with which he acts upon</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG R USSIA 161 them. He is not responsible for the products of his labor, which lie like a mys terious seed in the furrow of universal history. Whether the seed will sprout, and when, and what fruit it will bear—all that is in the hands of God. By the very nature of the fundamental historical law, the arena of its real ization is individual consciousness. In this sense the historical process is a pro cess of the emancipation and education of individual consciousness. The mass of men is inanely good-hearted and inanely hard-hearted; its spiritual life is wholly determined by the elemental power of natural conditions and the his torical past. Only the individual is freed from this power by thought; thus the progressive movement of mankind consists in breaking up the mass through thought. But at the same time the individual is subject to powerful influence from the side of the social structure. Consequently it may be said generally that the immediate aim of history is "an individual who is moral, educated, and independent of the determinations of fate, and a society that conforms to the demands of such an individual." This formula contains the core of Granovskii's philosophy of history. II Granovskii's career is inseparably linked with the movement which in Rus sia has been christened "the idealism of the 'thirties," and it can be evaluated properly only against the background of that movement. What was the ideal ism of the'thirties? Stormy intellectural movements arise in every cultured society from time to time and envelop a larger or smaller segment of the society. They are pre pared, of course, by the peaceful periods that precede them. But suddenly the accumulated material takes fire with a bright flame. Some one idea takes pos session of minds and is instantly transfered from the realm of speculation to the soil of feeling—that is, becomes a passion and a will, not of one or a few individuals, but of a certain like-minded group. These explosions of ideas are moments of inspiration for a society. Each of them places before society's eyes, with blinding brightness, some one aspect or part of the general human ideal, and by this inspiration fructifies life for a long time thereafter. There is no need to cite examples: Russian social life is particularly rich in such movements; one of the most powerful of them is taking place in Russia now.* These explosions of ideas are distinguished from one another by their de gree of universality, their storminess, their duration, but most of all and in particular by the degree to which their slogans approach the one all-embrac ing ideal of mankind. Every social movement is idealistic, for however realis tic the content of its idea or program may be, subjectively, in its représenta *The Russian revolution of 1905.-TRANS.</page><page sequence="4">162 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE tives, it is unfailingly based upon one of the eternal principles that are integral parts of the ideal—the principles of justice, natural rights, and the like. But the ideal is universal and its applications are innumerable ; the whole question is whether it is a small particle of the ideal that has intoxicated the men caught up in the movement or whether they have seen the whole sun rise be fore them. Unlike all of our subsequent, primarily political, social movements, the movement that claimed the majority of young Muscovites in the mid-1830s was not a partial revelation of the ideal. Its great peculiarity was that it had as its subject the entire ideal as a whole-more exactly, not any of its applica tions but the substance of the ideal itself. These young people dreamed not of partial improvements of a moral or political character, but of the reestablish ment in man of his divine nature in general. They said, in the words of their German teachers, that reason rules the universe—a reason that can attain self consciousness only in man; and that consequently man's highest duty is to live consciously in accordance with the same laws as the universe. In these concepts, as a contemporary (Annenkov) justly expressed it, a new world was opened to man. A kind of triumphant, radiant, joyous feeling filled life when it was shown to be possible to explain the phenomena of nature by the very laws that the human spirit obeys in its development; possible to close, apparently forever, the gulf dividing the two worlds, and to make of them one vessel for blending the eternal idea and eternal reason. With what youthful and noble pridé was the role reserved for man in this uni versal life then understood! By virtue of and by right of thought he transfered visible nature into himself, analyzed it in the bosom of his own consciousness—in a word, became its center, its judge, and its in terpreter. . .. At the terminus of the whole outlook stood moral obligations, and one of the most essential obligations was to deliver the divine part of the world idea within oneself from everything accidental, impure, and false, so as to have a right to the blessing of real, rational existence. This was the all-embracing system of ideas that confidently resolved the eter nal riddles of being and spirit. By the universality of this system and the enthusiasm with which the yourrger generation embraced it, we can judge how completely society had overcome its old, patriarchal world view. The half-educated mass still vege tated snugly in that view, but the sensitive young people were already suffo cating in an atmosphere of moral indifference and intellectual stagnation. A young man of our day, once his consciousness has been awakened, usually tends to become interested in a question concerning some particular aspect of existence; as for the fundamental questons, everything around him—books,</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG R USSIA 163 newspapers, conversation—immediately thrusts upon him some definite mode of dealing with them, regarded for the time as the mode most in accord with science. Whether this is good or bad is another matter. It was different then: such patterns had not yet been developed in the half-educated mass, and a young man who opened his eyes to the world found himself immediately face to face with a sphinx, with the unresolved eternal questions. It was just these questions that were answered by the new German philosophy, from which the young borrowed the foundations of their idealistic system. The kernel of this system was, of course, the new ideal of man: here the problem of the perfect individual was formulated directly and clearly, in its full sweep. The idealistic movement of the 'thirties arose in several streams which only later, toward the middle of the 'forties, converged to form two great rivers—Slavophilism and Westernism. But whatever the differences a mong the separate circles, they all either began with the question of what man is and what he should be, or very quickly came to that question. And it was posed not indirectly, in the garb of some practical interest, but in princi ple and in full. The initiation of the movement belonged, as we know, to Stankevich, by whom this question was both put on record and placed in the forefront. Stankevich instilled in his friends an intellectual passion, an intellectual de sire for the divine beauty of man, and in his own development he was an ex ample of the undivided energy of a spirit directed toward the realization of this idea. But man leads a double life, personal and social, and the problem of the perfect individual can only be resolved correctly on the ground of this dual but integral idea. Stankevich knew that; but, prizing above all the theoretical fullness of the ideal, he put aside the social part of the question. He said: man must be purged by his interrelations with other men, and in this sense the life of the human race is his education; on the other hand he must educate him self individually, by toiling for his own improvement. Thus progress occurs through a twofold education—social (in history) and personal—and those who proclaimed the ideal should have been expected to work it out in both of these directions. Stankevich, as we have seen, limited himself to one half of the problem: he strove to resolve the question theoretically (these are his ex act words): "How should one, separate man educate his being?" It was here that Granovskii's historical role was decided. In the direct sense of the word Stankevich's disciple and successor, he picked up the thread Stan kevich had dropped. He became, along with Belinskii, one of the teachers who explained the social meaning of the ideal to Russian society of the 'forties explained, in other words, the course and the goal of mankind's historical ed ucation. Granovskii's philosophy of history seems to us both narrow and artificial, and many of its premises seem to be fictions. But those who have fallen in the</page><page sequence="6">164 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE field of honor are not judged. These ideas did their work. In them the new ideal that was destined long to be the hidden mover of all our spiritual life— this lofty dream of Stankevich and his friends about a rational and beautiful life and a perfect man—was transfered (in rather crude form, it is true) onto social ground and was expressed in social language. By it a mighty impetus was given to the rise of social idealism in Russia, and if the next period of Russian history, beginning with the end of the 'fifties, was marked by a vast idealistic movement the fruit of which was the reforms of the age of Alexan der II, then no small credit for this belongs to Granovskii. It is no paradox to say that he was one of the organs of transmission through which the moral energy contained in Stankevich's solitary meditations was converted into the beneficial social action of Nicholas Miliutin* and his associates. 2. The Man I Among the peculiarities of contemporary Russian society upon which the future historian of our days will probably dwell with interest, is what might be called its atomization. In studying the contemporary intelligentsia from this standpoint he will no doubt contrast it with the epoch of the 'thirties and 'forties—the age of the ascendancy of tightly knit circles of friends. What ex plains this sharp difference? Why, seventy years ago, did centripetal forces govern the advanced segment of Russian society—forces under the operation of which all the best elements were irresistibly drawn together and combined into close groups, united not only by similarity of convictions and communi ty of aims but by a warm, thoroughly fraternal attachment? And why are the leading men of our time doomed to spiritual solitude, to stand each by him self, though all are engaged in the same work? Our groups and circles have a businesslike character. They are based on unity of views, on concurrence of efforts; we are joined into groups much more by a common struggle than by inner inclination, and for that reason our circles lack the heartfelt intimacy, the sincere sympathies that evidently ruled in those circles. Let the halo that surrounds them be in part deceptive; remoteness in time, like distance in space, softens outlines. But on the whole the fact is irrefut able. Recall the Moscow circles of the first half of the 'thirties. There was Stankevich's circle, comprising, besides Stankevich himself, Belinskii, Vasilii Botkin, Granovskii, Nererov, and-in the second rank-Krasov, Kliushnikov, Katkov, Kudriavtsev, etc. At the same time there was Herzen's circle, which * Nicholas Milliutin (1818-72), a Russian statesman of moderate liberal views, played a major role in the municipal government reforms of the 1840s and in the drafting of. the statutes which ended Russian serfdom in 1861.-TRANS.</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL GERSHENZ0N,^4 HISTORY OF YOUNG RUSSIA 165 included Herzen, Ogarév, Satin, Vadim Passek, Ketcher, Sazonov, and A. N. Savich. Then there were the circles of the 'forties: Herzen's new circle (Her zen, Ogarëv, Granovskii, Ketcher, Evgenii Korsh, Kriukov, Vasilii Botkin) and the circle of the early Slavophiles. And these are only the more prominent groups. How many minor groups there were as well, such as Sungurovskii's circle, Venevitinov's circle, and others! It would not be wrong to say that, of the generation born around 1812, not a single person who was in any way outstanding (with the exception of Lermontov) grew up unaffected by one or another of these circles. Neither Gogol' nor Turgenev escaped their influence. Perhaps the future historian will be able to trace the process of differentia tion that has splintered thinking Russia and made the existence of such cohe sive groups impossible in our day. Doubtless this atomization is a sign of growth, like every division, like the splitting of cells and cell colonies. One would like to think that we, too, like cells, are advancing through division to more complex combinations, based on a higher unity, as happened with the Italian intelligentsia in the second quarter of the last century. But even as we bow before the biological laws that condemn us to solitude, we cannot read without warm sympathy the stories of the men of the 'forties—of the firm bonds of trust and love that joined together, temporarily or for life, such men as Stankevich and Granovskii, Herzen and Ogarëv, Granovskii and Herzen, Be linskii and Botkin, and so on. A true cult of friendship reigned in their day— reigned not only among the young, but among mature men as well. It seems sentimental and ridiculous to us now. Who now would write his friends such long and intimate letters as Stankevich, Belinskii, and Ogarëv wrote to their friends? But it would be ridiculous even to regret it. II It is difficult for us today to imagine clearly the intellectual isolation in which a young man of the 'thirties initially found himself after he had drunk of the cup of Western knowledge and been intoxicated with its idealistic spir it. To begin with, the whole background of our intellectual life has changed enormously since then. A young man of our day who is first beginning to gain insight and ideas finds in the very air he breathes, one might say, innum erable things that are related to what he is seeking. In any magazine, in the facts reported in newspapers, in a tea table conversation—everywhere chords sound in harmony with him. Our scientific literature, both popular and pure, like our journalism, has increased unbelievably. Communication with the West, direct and through books, has been made relatively much easier. Thanks to all this, every new doctrine quickly becomes the common property of the intellectual public and saturates its atmosphere. Ten years ago a student who was a sworn follower of Marx surely felt like a member of a very large family. He could speak of Marx's doctrine with any friend or in any family of his ac</page><page sequence="8">166 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE quaintance, and new articles and books on the subject, Russian and foreign, were encountered every day. It was completely different in the 'thirties. What I have called the intellec tual public did not exist then. Abysmal ignorance reigned in the circles of the landowners and the bureaucrats, and the young man who had opened his mind to education fell at once into complete disharmony with his natural surroundings. The scholarly resources—books, journals, lectures, contacts with the West—of which we have so many, he had in the most limited num ber. It is only natural that in his isolation he felt helpless. No less significant was the character of the doctrines then being propaga ted. Between that day and ours there has been a brilliant flowering of the natural sciences, which has transformed all departments of knowledge and even philosophy. As a result of the realistic spirit of modern science, the ideas through which our generation has emancipated itself are comparatively close to everyday life, comparatively materialistic and prosaic. The men of the 'thirties and 'forties liberated themselves on Schelling and Hegel: those were the summits of metaphysical thinking, from which limitless, intoxicating vis tas were opened up before the mind. Not particular truths but the whole mys tery of the cosmos and of human existence seemed to be revealed in the books of those philosophers, and at the sight of the promised land the soul of the proselyte was seized by a rapture that bordered on religious ecstasy. From the general formula flowed a whole program of practical activity, embracing all of social and personal life. Everything was to be built anew: in place of instinct, patriarchalism, cloudy mysticism, authorities, creeds, and traditions there was to be a new order of life, based on reason, analysis, and right. All the foundations of community life-marriage, religion, the state were to shake off their obsolete forms and be transfigured. A new world, it seemed, was being born:1 Das alte stürzt,-es ändert sich die Zeit,-und neues Leben blüht aus den Ruinen.* This inspiration raised the young man of the 'thirties to such heights beyond the clouds that no paths remained to the val leys of his fathers. Only in the bosom of his sect could he find sympathy and support. More than that: what with the paucity of scholarly aids in that day, it was only there, in the living interchange of ideas and knowledge, that he could satisfy his natural desire for a deeper and broader mastery of the ideas once he had accepted them. Such were the chief causes which led to the rise of the famous Moscow cir cles of the 'thirties and 'forties. Belinskii, in a letter of 1840, defined in vir tually these terms the role of the circle in which he himself had been shaped: "The old collapses, times change, and a new life blooms on the ruins."-TRANS.</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG R USSIA 167 Education deprived us of religion. The circumstances of life (the cause of which was in the condition of society) did not give us a posi tive education and deprived us of every opportunity to ally ourselves with science. We were at odds with reality and had good reason to hate and scorn it, just as it had good reason to hate and scorn us. Where could we take refuge? On the desert island that was our circle. On these islands, men used familiar forms of address a day after they met, loved one another passionately, like women, entrusted one another with their most intimate secrets, made confessions to one another, and profoundly and sincerely believed in one another. "I am open before you," Stankevich told his friends. "We are each other's ethics," Ogarëv wrote much later to Herzen, and so it was in fact; every line of their letters and all the testimony of their contemporaries is evidence of it. III After a tiff with Bakunin (with whom he later broke entirely), Belinskii explained his closeness to him at the time as follows: "You are striving for what is lofty and I am striving for what is lofty, so let us be friends: that is the principle of our friendship." The principle of Granovskii's friendship with Herzen and Ogarëv was roughly the same. They met for the first time like sec tarians who had never seen one another but who know that they belonged to the same sect; or like unacquainted Masons of the same lodge. They were no longer youths; for their generation the stage of stormy passions was already over, having given way to steady, earnest work in the direction of the goals set by the youthful dream. But if the old intoxication was gone, knowledge and friendship remained the cornerstones of their being, as before. In their very work they continued to deepen their convictions; in practice their alien ation from their environment was felt far more sharply still than in their school years. And as before it was only in a circle of like-minded people that they could breathe and grow. Granovskii met Ogarëv in the winter of 183940, and they quickly became friends. Herzen's first glimpse of Granovskii came as Herzen was passing through Moscow in 1840, and he carried with him to Vladimir "a noble image, and based on it a belief in him as a future friend"; in 1842, resettled in Mos cow, Herzen came to know Granovskii "closely and deeply."2 Such their friendship remained for four long years, up to Herzen's last months in Russia. These were the same four years that Ogarëv spent abroad;but separation did not weaken the bond. In September, 1844, Ogarëv wrote Granovskii: Why don't you write, my dear Granovskii? We came together so warmly and loved each other so, that I don't think a separation can pour cold water on our friendship. The devil knows I would like to hear your voice, in which I find something irresistibly attractive.</page><page sequence="10">168 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE Relations between Granovskii and Herzen were thoroughly fraternal. "We quickly became friends and saw each other almost every day." Herzen wrote later. "We sat through the nights until dawn talking of everything under the sun. . . .It is during these wasted hours, and through them, that people grow to gether so inseparably and irrevocably." It would be superfluous to cite ex tracts from their correspondence testifying to their tender attachment to and respect for each other. All this time, right up to their break, they were in separable; not one cloud, it seems, darkened their friendship. Herzen and Ogarëv were drawn to Granovskii above all, of course, by the similarity of their basic convictions: their common hatred of the existing real ity, their desire to draw Russia out of her ignorance and slavery, a faith in the creative power of the free individual, the assignment to science and art of a leading role in the development of a cultured society. Granovskii, who preached these views from the professorial chair with brilliant success, was dear to Herzen as a bold champion of their common cause, as the most influ ential and talented spokesman in the whole circle. When somewhat later the Westernist and Slavophile camps began to be distinguished more sharply, Gra novskii's lectures assumed for Herzen the significance of manifestoes of his Westemist camp. The success of Granovskii's public lectures in 184344 was a kind of personal triumph for Herzen. Twice he wrote ecstatic articles about them, and in his diary he noted the social significance and the success of al most every lecture with the joy of a friend and companion. Granovskii, too, in his turn, prized Herzen's writings highly and, as Herzen reports, went from house to house to read Herzen's articles in Annals of the Fatherland, com menting on them and becoming angry if anyone did not like them. But community of theoretical views and respect for mutual talents is not enough for friendship—at least for the kind of friendship that sprang up be tween Herzen and Granovskii and between Granovskii and Ogarëv. Evidently, despite all their differences, there was something congenial in their natures that unconsciously brought them together; probably they themselves could not have defined more precisely what they had in common. Herzen says only: "With many I was in greater agreement in opinions, but with him I was closer there somewhere in the depths of my soul." Ogarëv, too, says essentially no more in his verse missive to Granovskii in 1843. Inner-peace and heart-aches So strangely found themselves Kindred sounds in your soul, As if from above one life Was given to us both. We are equally healthy And equally afflicted; Harsh fate allotted us both The same melancholy.</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG R USSIA 169 I joyously read in your message That you can speak with me, As one can only with a wife, About secret inner suffering. But he then adds: The one thing I value in myself, What I see as the basis of our friendship (Although always abortively I loathe my foolish weakness) Is that womanly-gentle, tender manner. I know not if I am right or wrong.3 These last lines give one concrete indication, the accuracy of which Herzen af firms when he says that for him and his other friends Granovskii replaced the absent Ogarëv. Actually their rare refinement, profound inborn humanity, and sincere tactfulness made Granovskii and Ogarëv exceedingly similar, and perhaps it was just this femininity of temper that so strongly attracted (and vice versa) the impetuous, active, masculine nature of Herzen. IV This friendship, as everyone knows, ended in a break. It took place in the middle of 1846, not long before Herzen left the country. We shall see below that the three participants, although painfully distressed by the falling out, unanimously regarded it as inevitable. We shall not be able to understand this inevitability if we confine ourselves to an analysis of the views that were at issue among them; we must go deeper, to the springs that feed man's entire psychic life, not excluding his consciousness. There are many ways of approaching a definition of what is customarily called the "nature" of a man. In this case, where three persons are under dis cussion, the comparative method suggests itself. Thus we must find some point of comparison that is sufficiently important for all men and more or less central for all three of the men under study. Such a point is provided by their attitude toward the present, and thus also toward the two moments that limit and so often obscure it: the past and the future. How a man reacts to his memories and to the ever present chance of ill fortune, to what degree his re membrance of the past or fear of the future detracts from the fullness of the present moment for him—no one is likely to deny the capital importance of this question. I shall begin with Herzen. In his Diary (184245) he touches on these mat ters repeatedly. He is surprised and angered by people's disregard for the present:</page><page sequence="12">170 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE If we scrutinize life deeply, the supreme good is of course existence itself, whatever its external trappings may be. When we realize this, we realize that nothing in the world is more foolish than to scorn the pre sent in favor of the future. The present is the real realm of existence. Every moment, every pleasure, should be caught; the soul should un ceasingly be bared, be filled, should soak up everything around it and pour itself into everything. Life's goal is life. But people can only remember what they have lost; they do not value the present, but sacrifice it to dreams, or fear, of the future. Yet the future is never arranged according to our ideas; lawlessly it "gives us. what is beyond our expectations and tramples under foot our most legitimate hopes." And such is he himself: his attitude toward the present is devoid of the spontaneity that he considers healthy. He is haunted by fear of the fortuitous, by the spectre of a terrible fate that rules human life and brings appalling re sults from an innocent action. Before you see or know it you are lured into a hopeless situation; where, then, is freedom? He speaks with horror of the in constancy of everything that is best and most sacred in life. Everything in life is precarious except thought, but thought alone cannot fully satisfy, be cause it is "already an abstraction from individual life, which is the only full life." He knows that this fear of inconstancy is a morbid and absurd feeling, but he cannot suppress it. "We wrong the present frightfully," he writes Ogar ëv on 1 January 1845, and he repeats it in his diary. All our memories and hopes are sui generis abstractions, while life slips through our fingers unnoticed and unappreciated. No, stop, good instant, let me sip you drop by drop! A moment of true ecstasy is with out memory and without hope, because it is complete in itself. In fact the present is never alone; our whole past life is reflected in it, is pre served. Provided the present does not suppress it. I speak of this not so much for your sake as for mine. I cannot sus tain myself at this realistic, practical height; if I do not fall victim to doleful romantic brooding I am stricken by cowardice in the face of the future. My pleasure often wanes from the cold thought that tomorrow I may lose it. All sorts of things can happen. One must be in a state of complete inactivity to think this way, but nonetheless it does come to mind. Man can least of all become reconciled to the exceeding inconstancy, the instability of all the best things he has. It is, apparently, a simple matter: the more durable a thing, the more lifeless and remote from us it is. Precisely in this shimmering des Schwebenden, in this delicate ness and inconstancy is the ultimate word, life's final fragrance, because everything durable is immobile and spiritless, while the delicate is pro cess, movement,energy,das Werden.**4 *"0f that which soars", or "hovers."-TRANS. * * "Becoming. "-TRANS.</page><page sequence="13">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG RUSSIA 171 In the diary he develops this profound idea more fully. Not only are the good things in life inconstant, life itself is incon stant. The slightest imbalance in its complex chemistry, in this desper ate struggle of the organism against its constituent parts, and life is snuffed out. It does not follow, however, that it is better not to be born or, once born, to slit your throat so as not to be subject to accidents. Everything beautiful is delicate. It is the flowers that perish with each cold wind; the coarse stem grows stronger, but then it has no fragrance or bright petals. Life in its supreme manifestation is weak, because all material power has been expended to reach that height: muscles can be severed, limbs amputated, but the brain must not be handled roughly. Such are the blessings of love—one should revel in them, surrender to them, live in them, should catch and prize each moment. Nur wenn er glühet, labet der Quell. *5 And as a result he comes to the conclusion that one should seize the moment, realize in oneself all opportunities for happiness— by that I mean both public activity and the happiness of learning no less than the happiness of friendship, love, family sentiments—though there, what will be will be. It is not my responsibility ; he is responsible who has hidden his talent in the earth, so.that it would not be stolen.6 This is a courageous and liberal view; but in his life Herzen, as he himself acknowledged, did not always possess this liberal courage. True, both earlier and even during these years he could enjoy a moment with wholehearted en thusiasm and without looking back; but frequently the thought of the future, the fear of dreadful eventualities, spoils the present for him. Interestingly e nough, when the possibility becomes an actuality and the expectation a cer tainty, he again finds his resolution and composure: In moments of decision I find my strength at last and stand as if at the barrier during a duel—I wait to see whether the bullet will go past me or into my chest. ... I wait darkly, summoning all my determina tion. Reflection appears in the midst of expectation, and I go up and down the mountain with a savage, ferocious consistency, not turning from the terror but scrutinizing it. If Herzen fears the future, for Granovskii it is the past that darkens the present. He is one of those primarily contemplative natures in whom memory is far stronger than actual experience. In one letter he says that he never for *"Only when they seethe do the waters refresh."-TRANS.</page><page sequence="14">172 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE gets anything, that the injuries and sorrows of his youth are still capable of troubling him deeply, and he applies Pushkin's verse to himself: "In my soul the grief of days past, like wine, grows stronger with age." "I never reconcile myself to my spiritual losses," he says in another place. "I bear the grief with me throughout my life. Stankevich, my sisters—for me they die again every day."7 His soul, like Tiutchev's, is an elysium of shades, and not only the shades of those dear to him, but the shades of all his broken hopes and illu sions. With this heavy burden in his soul he walks wearily through life, pious ly cherishing the memory of the past and little believing in the possibility of happiness. His mournful recollections prevent him from yielding wholeheartedly to the moment, and they sadden life's prospects. He values labor—not simply for its immediate purpose but especially because labor "cures the soul of painful longings": "I had so many," he says, "and enough still remain in the depths of my soul; I do not let them express themselves." As early as 1843 he writes to Werder: I have never so well understood what you kept repeating to me then: toil and renunciation! In effect nothing else is left. I have already re nounced so many of the hopes of my youth; it remains for me only to renounce my youth itself. And I shall soon make that sacrifice as well, for my heart, I surely sense, is growing old and weary.8 And in his best days, a year later, he writes: For the time being Herzen and I are happier than all the others. But will this happiness last for long? I have no faith in life, my soul has been frightened by frequent losses, and I fear new ones. Today everything is fine, tomorrow everything mav change. I have grown timid and nervous. Herzen, trembling before the future, was at least free of the power of the past; Granovskii was subject to both, to such a degree that for him the pre sent became a tenuous path between two abysses. He had no trace of the bold desire that filled Herzen, to bridle and tame savage life, to compel it to bear him across gulfs and mountains. Ogarëv represents the third and most harmonious type. The years 184345 were the period in which his world view took definite form—a world view which he then put into practice with surprising thoroughness for the remain der of his life. As he himself had already recognized quite clearly by this time, in his complex nature two features must be acknowledged as the most charac teristic. First, a weakness of active will, which made him the plaything of ex ternal circumstances and of his own emotions. Second, the presence of an e normous passive force in the depths of his soul, a feeling of profound peace and unshakeable hope that deserted him neither in his days of depression nor</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG RUSSIA 173 in moments of spiritual storm. His whole world view grew out of these two fundamental qualities oftiis nature. The highest aim that he set for himself and for every man was to learn how to right one's sail coolly in the middle of a stormy sea, to conquer chance not by fleeing from it but by remaining "the same calm, spiritual being, by pre serving in an unsympathetic life a profound sympathy with oneself, with the world of one's feelings, consciousness, and action." Reconciliation must be not external but internal; one must not reconcile oneself to every vile reality, and regard the limited moment as real and unalterable: that is apathy or hy pocrisy. But a man must become reconciled with himself—that is, must recon cile himself as an individual with himself as. universal spirit. This inner recon ciliation a man attains by saturating himself with truth. Truth in emotion is love, truth in thought is rationality: both must permeate the moral world of man—that is, the world of his actions. Only in this way can man inwardly rise above accidents—that is, remain true to himself, to his eternal essence, amid all disturbances. And this alone is complete happiness: "Complete happiness is to harken consciously to the great symphony of life and to play one's part in it diligently and out of the fullness of one's heart, however sadly disturb ing are the sounds that are heard." Life should be a work of art—that is, a free realization, in personal activity, of an inner law. Ogarëv still calls this idea nothing more than a presentiment: he knows that before it can be realized he is faced with a long journey, with the labor ious inner work of freeing himself from many romantic illusions. But he feels that the moment is already near when he will shake off all the surface bitter ness of life and find within himself the strength to live in conformity with truth. That this theory was not contrived by Ogarev but flowed trom the depths of his nature is shown by the quiet courage with which he looks back and a head. He is free of the burden of memory and the fear of accident that op pressed Granovskii and Herzen. Neither of them had so many reasons to re member his past with horror and repugnance as has Ogarëv, because neither of them had so fruitlessly squandered his youth, his powers, his wealth, had erred so often or fallen so low. Yet Ogarëv does not know remorse. In his lex icon, to be remorseful means "to keep on enjoying one's grief at the fact that one acted wrongly"; remorse is an undefined melancholy, self-contained and for that reason sterile. There is another attitude toward one's mistakes: to renew oneself inwardly in such a way as to rise above bitter memories. Then experience does not paralyze a man but becomes a guiding and enlightening force. In this fearless view of oneself, one another, and the world, in this steadfastness of love and inspiration amid all sorrows and mistakes, Ogarëv sees true maturity of spirit. If the soul has blemishes, it also has the power to purge itself of these blemishes. To surrender to self-reproach and pessimism is to shun a clear accounting with oneself and the product .of such accounting—</page><page sequence="16">174 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE self-renewal. Self-reproach and pessimism are the result of secret cowardice, because behind them man adroitly conceals from himself the fact that he is too lazy to live a healthy and vigorous life. Ogarëv's attitude toward the future is marked by the same sovereign free dom. Herzen's fear of the future Ogarëv calls romanticism turned inside out. He himself does not acknowledge the existence of senseless accidents; to fear the future, he says in one place, hinders his consciousness of union mit dem Allgemeinen. * The accidental, in his view, is nature's fantasy ; nature moves in this sphere as fantasy moves in artistic production—freely but harmoniously, boundlessly but purposefully. Individuality forms an organic part of the world-whole and is subject to its laws, and consequently so does chance, for "chances are the separate words in the book of fate." An unfortunate acci dent overtaking someone dear to us can plunge us into lasting grief. But one cannot quarrel with it, just as one cannot be angry at the inevitability of death, of decay, and so on. How can one quarrel with nature, with external necessity, with what is beyond man's world and thus beyond all possibility of combat and conquest? And as if to excuse himself he writes Herzen: "What am I to if chance does not offend me?"** Later Ogarëv actually achieved the profound inner reconciliation that was still only a presentiment in the mid-'forties, and its result was a tranquil cour age that Granovskii and Herzen never found, and with it complete emancipa tion from "romantic illusions." By 1846 he writes his wife: Ich bin nüchtern geworden. I do not know how to translate this German expression. It is not aridity of heart, but a state in which you feel the reality in everything—in thought as in affection—and in which experience becomes a necessary condition of life. And in fact an unusual sobriety of outlook, an unshakeable determinism in regard to himself as well as to things and other people, characterizes him in subsequent years. "He became accessible to every man," relates Annenkov (who knew him well at that very time, in the mid-'forties), *"With the Universal."-TRANS. **This wise fatalism, this-if it may be so called-veneration of the future was ex pressed with remarkable force in a sonnet by Wilhelm Humboldt. "There is a power of fate, a secret power. In union with the forces of nature she determines for the dying the hour of suffering and the hour of bliss; before her alone I bow my head. He who honors fate's sacred verdict, though it be heavy, does not yield to woe, and does not rejoice ar rogantly in happiness, knowing both the rewards and the penalties of justice. As the stars trace their radiant path, so invariably and with irresistible power does fate from a secret distance intersect the vain circles of our desires.

Furthermore he acquired an uncommon men tal composure that did not leave him for the rest of his life. Every fact and event that came in turn as the logical consequence of the whole proceeding course of life, was regarded by him as legitimate and received his consent and support, even though it had in itself no pretensions to manifest moral character and could even have aroused hostility and condemnation. He applied the same standard to himself personally. He viewed with perfect clarity and tranquility the approach of old age, the multiplying attacks of his malignant illness, the destruction with which he was threatened, his whole lost, ruined life. He regretted nothing and felt no remorse. This was a great and moreover a self-conscious spiritual force, but in truth it was only a passive force. The past and the future had no power over him; they did not come between him and the present moment. But he was able on ly to take from the present, wholeheartedly, what it offered him: he could not act in the present creatively. He himself very aptly said: "My enemy is not the past or the future but the present, in which I cannot make up my mind." In other words, with him the volitional impulse never reached full completion, but remained each time at the stage of the co-existence of two or more different desires. Thus there can be no doubt that, of the three friends, Ogarëv looked at reality the most dispassionately, with the least clouded view. He approached the Hegelian ideal of the rational man who calmly acknowledges that two times two is four without being indignant that it is not three or outraged that it is not five. Herzen came close to him in not allowing fear of the future to prevent him from looking clearly at the present. Granovskii was another mat ter. The "romanticism" that was rooted firmly in his nature and that kept him eternally tributary to the past was profoundly hostile to the realistic view of the world. Ogarëv, who had endured so many shipwrecks and buried so much in the waves, nonetheless felt at ease and free in the open sea of reality. Herzen, too, sailed over it freely, although expecting storms. It filled Granov skii with horror: he could not forget that it had swallowed up so many beings dear to him, and he sought a quiet haven. Such a haven was his world view, based on memories that were partisan but full of undying love, on beliefs that were narrow but charming in their sincerity. He was not at home in the new world which the natural sciences were then disclosing-the world ruled by the iron law of determinism. Herzen and Ogarëv exulted in the good word of liberation they took from</page><page sequence="18">176 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE Feuerbach. He gave them the courage to regard those terrible cliffs "against which all who dared to think—from the seven Greek sages to Kant and Hegel were crushed" as a fog illuminated by fantasy. A vital sense of reality helped them free themselves from the dogma of the priority of logic to nature, and then, in an agonizing search for a way out of the dualism of idea and being, they arrived finally at a consciousness of the need to understand being in it self first of all. Hence their passionate enthusiasm for the natural sciences in 1843-46. In the last analysis both of them were more interested in social life and consequently in history, and they arrived simultaneously at the realiza tion that history must be based on anthropology, anthropology in turn on physiology, and physiology on chemistry. At the beginning of 1845, telling Herzen about the lectures in anthropology begun in Paris by Auguste Comte and about Botkin's and Frolov's studies in the natural sciences, Ogarëv point ed triumphantly to the fact that the new outlook of positive science which they both had adopted was becoming more and more common in Europe ev ery day, that interest was being aroused everywhere in anthropology, the sci ence of concrete man. It was a real emancipation from every preconceived point of view, from both spiritualism and materialism. They found a way out of the duality of logic and nature: matter is just an abstraction from below, as logic is an ab straction from above. In concrete reality there is, strictly speaking, neither the one nor the other; there is rather their interaction, there is process. And Herzen and Ogarëv would set themselves the task of studying this process im partially, without shrinking from extreme conclusions. Positive science would not kill their idealism but would give it a firm foundation, channel it, and di rect it toward realistic, practical goals. Nor did the spirit of the times pass by Granovskii. We have seen that along with Herzen and Ogarëv he does acknowledge a determinism reigning in his tory, "a law or, better, a necessity." He believes that a clear knowledge of the laws that define the movement of historical events can be achieved only through attentive study of the facts of the spiritual world and nature in their interaction, and hence he considers geography and anthropology the founda tions of history. But at these theoretical premises he stops, and in one jump he leaps unexpectedly from the narrow confines of determinism to the limit less sphere of subjective teleology. The "necessity" reigning in history proves to be the purpose of the historical movement; it is nothing other than "the moral law, in the realization of which mankind's ultimate purpose on earth consists." From here he develops a whole system of historical optimism, of faith in the divine bond that embraces the entire life of mankind. A trans cendental purposefulness that goes completely counter to determinism is introduced into the historical process, and the desire to maintain this point of view in the study of events quite often forces Granovskii either to bypass, or to dismiss with a sentence, blocks of fact that cannot be analyzed in terms of this purposefulness.</page><page sequence="19">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTORY OF YOUNG RUSSIA 111 When Ogarëv read in some German pamphlet in 1845 an apt criticism of the old theory of atmospheric pressure, he wrote Herzen: The author has carried out the entire negative half of his pamphlet with clarity, but to explain the phenomena in another way he has re sorted to "nature abhors a vacuum," and there it became disgusting. Everything mystical has become incredibly repugnant to me, and I can not view without disgust the supposition of a purely moral quality like "abhors" in nature.9 Granovskii, not long before, in the summer of 1844, wrote his wife apro pos of the discovery of a sunspot by astronomers and of Herzen's prediction of the possibility of a future upheaval in the solar system that would wipe a way all earthly life without a trace: The great astronomer who assures you that sunspots have produced a cold summer and signify an upheaval in the solar system is unscrupu lously exploiting the mathematician's right to talk nonsense and be ig norant of history. This phenomenon has recurred a thousand times, and each time the mathematicians and the mob have explained it in their own way and drawn terrifying conclusions from it. . . . But suppose it is as they say. If this sun is extinguished and this earth cools, spirit will continue the work begun here in some other place. What Chinese ab surdity there is in the supposition that the whole life of spirit is bound up exclusively with the organic life of our planet! .What a detraction against reason, what a denial of every rational purpose in cosmic being, is contained in this belief in the power of blind, senseless chance, which has taken it into its head, the devil knows why, to soil the sun!10 A rational purpose in cosmic being-that was the "anthropomorphism c?es Allgemeinen"* (to use the language of that day), in comparison with which the "abhors" of the author of the pamphlet on atmospheric pressure seems rather inoffensive. Herzen wrote later that nothing would ever come of Granovskii—that he would be neither a man of pure thought nor a rigorous natural scientist: he could endure neither the dispassionate impartiality of logic nor the dispassion ate objectivity of nature. Indeed Granovskii was devoid of the inner strength that permits a man to look Medusa in the face without turning to stone. He had to turn away from the spectacle of the irrationality of nature and the still more terrifying spectacle of the antimonies of the historical process. So as not to become lost in the chaotic turbulence of concrete reality, he needed supports and enclosures. Such an external support was his faith in the moral goal of history; such an enclosure was his faith in jenseits.** *"of the Universal."-TRANS. **"The next world."-TRANS.</page><page sequence="20">178 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE He himself testifies that religious feelings were instilled in him in child hood by his mother, were then weakened by a misspent youth, and were a roused again by the influence of his wife. Most of all they were strengthened by a series of grievous losses he suffered one after the other, beginning in 1840: in that year death took Stankevich, soon afterwards Elizabeth Frolov— who had a powerful influence on Granovskii and was bound to him by warm ties of friendship—in the summer of 1842 the elder of his tenderly loved sis ters, later that same year his younger sister, and in 1843 his brother. He nev er resigned himself to these losses. They "died again every day," and his only remaining consolation was the hope of meeting them beyond the grave. "Do not be sad, my Liza. There is another life, without separation," he once wrote to his wife. Herzen and Ogarëv were also deeply religious in their youth and until the very end of the 'thirties. But here is what Herzen wrote in his diary as early as 1842, apropos the death of Vadim Passek: A mystery, and a dreadful, terrible mystery! But how clearly evident it is here that jenseits is a dream. . . . "We shall meet again, shall soon meet again" said his [Passek's] wife ; a warm consoling faith—my final faith, to which I clung with all my might. No, you too I have sacrificed to truth! But it was bitter to part with you, romantic hope of a new life.11 Ogarëv, too, parted with the belief, but somewhat later. It would be difficult to display more clearly the difference between the two natures—one wholly self-supported, the other seeking supports outside itself—than Ogarëv has done in the following lines addressed to Granovskii (1845): Grief at the loss of dear ones should remain a profound and lifelong grief. For that reason I hate consolations by way of jenseits. They hin der grief, they alleviate the sense of loss, they are a cowardly fear of suffering. In his biography of Granovskii, A. V. Stankevich deems it necessary to de fend Granovskii's world view by arguing that he cherished his beliefs not be cause he was afraid to part with a comforting and reassuring habit, but because he was opposed to the rash thinking that "boldly announces the final results of science at the outset of study and work, and erects its conjectures and shaky imaginings into dogma." I believe there can be no talk of defense and justification here, since as Granovskii himself once said the outlook of every thinking man is a product of the evolution of his entire life. But moreover the biographer is mistaken. Among Herzen's papers was a letter, hitherto un known, from Granovskii to Ogarëv, dating from the beginning of January, 1845. It contains a sincere and frank confession that portrays the evolution of his beliefs fully in accordance with the picture drawn above and so clearly that it leaves no room for doubt. I quote it in full.12</page><page sequence="21">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG R USSIA 179 I do not like to write letters or dissertations, and that is why I write to you so rarely and remain so long a professor in spe* And yet some times I want desperately to talk with you. I think: I'll write him this and that, and I prepare an enormous missive in my head; but it remains in my head. A need is somehow blunted if it is not satisfied, and I calmly wait for another such moment. Herzen's last letter cut me to the quick. I intended to write you a long letter, and in accordance with my noble custom wrote to myself. The letter never materialized. The very process of writing is onerous to me—holding the pen in my hand and so on. It is strange and vexing! After Stankevich died you and Herzen be came my closest friends; it was easier for me to bare my soul to you than to anyone else. It does not seem difficult to get to know me, es pecially for friends. Why, then, does Herzen lie about me so? I am poured aus einem Guss,** I am a romantic, and so forth. All that is nonsense, but nonsense which it is painful to hear from Herzen. He should know me a little better than that. I—aus einem Guss! I am in wardly all torn and tortured. This is not just talk. You know, perhaps. I am tortured, of course, not by cosmic questions but for the most part by personal losses, experiences of life in which without any doubt I am richer than all of you. In the face of all this I have gained an artificial composure in history and in friendship. When I came back from Berlin I had no need of jenseits and I was prepared to accept, on the basis of a faith in reason, all the conclusions of philosophy (the process itself has always been very difficult forme, even when I studied logic with the aid of Werder and Stankevich); I faced all these conclusions without fear. Stankevich died, my sisters died, and jenseits became a kind of postulate with me. Much in me has changed for purely personal reasons. Now I am completely disaccus tomed to theorizing. I went into history and I think I have a calling for it. This study and this interest alone—to which, however, so much is related—gives coher ence to my inner being. Yes, I understand that because of it, I can ap pear to an outsider to be a very equable and calm person. But Herzen might have looked a little deeper. The study of history in its turn has produced much in me, especially a kind of scepticism. It is difficult to guard oneself against it in the midst of the eternal movement of forms and ideas. One replaces another, wave chases wave. Each century had its truth. Sometimes it becomes sad and terrible. I have read Spinoza little, but of all philosophers he is the only one I can still read. The result of all this is that if it were not for history, for my wife, for all of you, and for wine, I would really not give a kopek for life. I love life for these things only. Farewell. The journal did not appear. What kind of romantic am I? Farewell again. I press your hand warmly. *"In expectation."-TRANS. **An idiom meaning to be homogeneous or harmonious.-TRANS.</page><page sequence="22">180 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE In this letter Granovskii speaks of two things that must not be confused: his intimate beliefs and his scholarly views. His beliefs he does not even try to justify or prove: he frankly declares that they are the fruit of his personal ex perience, that he needs them as supports in a trying life. He defends only his scholarly scepticism, based on a conviction of the relativity and imperma nence of the truths man has attained. Clearly one cannot speak of a causal connection between his faith and this scepticism: the scepticism leads only to the denial of dogmatism and to tolerance, but it cannot of itself engender positive beliefs. It does not sow their seeds in the soul: it simply makes it eas ier for them to grow and flourish. To the letter just quoted, Herzen wrote a postscript: Perhaps I really was mistaken with "aus einem Gusse." However, I did not use the expression in the sense in which Granovskii took it. The point is that he found a thoroughly absorbing, integral, most congenial calling, and he pursues that calling diligently, profoundly, and beauti fully. As for accusing him of romanticism—primo, that is not an accusa tion; and secundo, remember what you yourself write about Frolov.* What does it matter how and why such and such elements came into being? The question is what a man is, and whether he has overcome what is external to him.14 That is just where the question stands for us. VI In its basic outlines, the world view of Granovskii, who concentrated early in a particular field of knowledge, had assumed its final form by 1842, the year his friendship with Herzen began. At that time Herzen was just entering the final stage of his own development : in the next four years followed his acquaintance with Feuerbach, his study of Hegel, an answer to the question of the relationship of logic to being, his studies in the natural sciences, and his transition from metaphysics to the realism of positive science. The develop ment of every thinking man is a matter of discovering himself in conscious ness—that is, of working out for himself, or finding ready-made, the conscious formulas which most fully express his instinctive, innate spiritual bent. For Herzen that process of self-discovery took place in the years 1842 to 1846. In *In a letter of 13 September 1844 [actually 29/17 December 1844] Ogarëv wrote: "There are limits of weakness and strength (. . .] One of the strongest of men, one of those closest to me in spirit and in soul is Frolov, but sometimes even to his strength there is an impassable limit. We have our points of dispute. He has a friend in the other world. An accident, misfortune, an offense by nature against something our heart holds sacred force a search for jenseits. Law, a sense of limits, dependency on accident worry me more morbidly than anything in the world," etc.!3_AUTHOR.</page><page sequence="23">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG RUSSIA 181 those years, during which he wrote his articles on dilettantism in science as well as "Letters on the Study of Nature," "Krupov," and "Apropos of a Cer tain Drama," his moral and philosophical outlook, which remained essential ly unchanged for the rest of his life, assumed its final shape. Hence the ele ments of discord that, at the beginning of their friendship, existed only in em bryo—on Herzen's side at least—were bound to come out with full clarity by the end of this period. They could not help but come to light, moreover, because that was de manded by the very character of the intellectual life of the circle to which Granovskii and Herzen belonged. If only we had had some pressing occupation, [Herzen says] that would have absorbed us completely. But as it was all our activity was in the realm of thought and of the propagation of our convictions. . . . What compromises could we make in that area?15 In his diary he often returns to this theme, without any relation to his dis putes with Granovskii. He sees clearly that a deep, unnatural break with ex istence, with all real life, must lead inevitably to idiosyncracies, to eccentrici ties, to intolerance: Inner possibility combined with outer impossibility turns abilities in to a venom that poisons life. They rot within the organism, ferment and decompose—hence an outlook of anger and gall, a narrowness in our very thinking. Thus there could be no compromise, both because of the nature of their cause and because of the morbidly sensitive attitude of both parties. Herzen in particular could not compromise. In the disagreement that was brewing the initiative inevitably had to come from him. Not to mention the differ ences in their natures—Granovskii contemplative and tolerant, Herzen active and impetuous—it is significant that Granovskii was defending the traditional outlook, whereas Herzen was a proselyte of a young doctrine that had just ad vanced to conquest and was intoxicated with its first victories. This militant mood is very strongly expressed in Herzen's diary beginning in 1844. A mind by nature primarily critical, profoundly hostile to the spirit of authority and to all foggy thinking, Herzen early became, as Annenkov aptly put it, "a tireless stalker of mental vices, of missteps in one's develop ment, of the incongruity of actions with their occasions." The new, realistic, scientific movement to which he now dedicated himself was bound to intensi fy greatly his aversion to traditional beliefs that are sanctified by general si lence, to all unverified truths. It is only natural that during this time the cam paign against what seemed to him mental laziness or arbitrariness should as</page><page sequence="24">182 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE sume the character of a sacred duty, in the performance of which there could be no compromises. As early as December, 1844—a year and a half before the falling out—he wrote in his diary : Our personal relationships do much to damage the originality and the directness of our opinions. Respecting people's fine qualities, we sacrifice our sharpness of mind to them. One must have a great deal of strength to be able to weep and nonetheless sign Camille Desmoulin's death-warrant.16 In this envy of Robespierre's strength, he wrote later, the germs of the bitter arguments of 1846 already slumbered. The break had in fact become inevit able. In Chapter XXXII of My Past and Thoughts, Herzen tells in detail the sto ry of this "theoretical rupture" between himself and Ogarëv, on the one side, and Granovskii on the other.17 His story is supplemented by the memoirs of Annenkov, Panaev, and Tat'iana Astrakov (in T. P. Passek's memoirs). - The rift came out in the open in the summer of 1846, when all three— Granovskii, Herzen, and Ogarëv (who had just returned to Russia after a pere grination of several years abroad) were living at a dacha in Sokolovo near Moscow; but it had been building for at least two years, as can also be seen from the letter quoted above. Herzen relates that even before they themselves became aware of their disagreement it had been noticed by the younger gen eration. The young people, thoroughly imbued with realistic views, had de voured Herzen's "Dilettantism in Science" and "Letters on the Study of Na ture"; they considered him and Belinskii the spokesmen for their philosophi cal views, and for all their love of Granovskii they had already begun to rebel against his "romanticism." In the quiet of country life and the intimacy of daily contacts, the disagreement was bound to come out. It was too substan tial, it too closely touched a vital nerve of each of the participants for a break to be averted, even by the warm love that linked them. Every theoretical con versation inevitably returned to the same fundamental questions of world view, and the arguments became more frequent. "Ogarëv, though he had not seen me for some four years," says Herzen, "was taking exactly the same line I was.We had covered the same distance by different routes and found ourselves together." Granovskii, apparently, kept to his defenses and tried to avoid a sharp break; it was Herzen who started the deciding argument. He relates that one day that summer, when conversation again touched on a sensitive point, he observed that "the development of science, its contemporary state, obliges us to accept certain truths whether we like it or not; that once these truths had been learned they would cease to be historical riddles but become simply irrefutable facts of consciousness, like Euclid's theorems, like Kepler's laws, like the inseparability of cause and ef fect, of spirit and matter."</page><page sequence="25">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG R USSIA 183 "All that is so little obligatory," Granovskii objected, "that I shall never accept your dry, cold idea of the unity of body and spirit; the immortality of the soul disappears along with it. Perhaps you do not need it, but I have bur ied too much in the grave to give up this faith. Personal immortality is a neces sity for me." "What a wonderful world it would be," said Herzen, "if everything that anyone needed suddenly appeared, as in fairy tales." "Just think, Granovskii," Ogarëv added: "This is really a kind of running away from misfortune." "Listen," retorted Granovskii, turning pale and assuming the air of a stran ger, "I shall be much obliged if you never speak to me of these subjects again. There are many interesting things we can discuss much more profitably and enjoyably." This conversation made everything clear: "So here is the boundary, the limit—and with it, censorship!" Herzen says that it was as painful as if some one near and dear to him had died. How strong was the pain both in him and in Ogarëv is shown by the verse ("To Iskander") composed by Ogarëv that evening on the road to Moscow. I rode along an empty field ; The air was damp and cool, the moon Tediously traveled the pale-blue sky, And the flat side grew blue. Sorrow and strength interchanged in my soul, My thought was talking to you. All is steppe, steppe! Not a soul, not a sound, Far ride I proud and alone. My fate lies within me. Not sorrow, not boredom Tortures me. Everything in its own time. I sternly spoke the truth in our friendly circle Friends left in infantile fright. And he left—whom like a brother Or sister I loved so tenderly! His loss, like death, depressed me; He was pure and noble of soul, He had a heart tender as a caress, His friendship, like a fairy tale, is memorable to me. You alone remained unchanged to me. I wait for you. We entered life together; Our superior union remained the same! Again, tirelessly speaking of truth, We alone will walk the woeful way, Let dreams and people pass by!</page><page sequence="26">184 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE Granovskii suffered no less. Later, in mid-1849, he wrote Herzen abroad: The best powers of my soul went into my friendship with you two. My soul has its share of passion, which made me weep in 1846 and blame myself for my powerlessness to break a bond which apparently could not long endure. Almost in desperation I observed that you were fastened to my soul by threads that could not be cut without catching the living flesh. It must be noted that their theoretical differences were aggravated that summer by a whole series of petty misunderstandings, gaucheries, and mutual affronts, for most of which Herzen was apparently to blame, but which at the same time showed the strained and nervous state of the whole circle. The manifest disintegration of this circle of friends was one of the chief causes that led Herzen to go abroad with his family that winter. By autumn, Ogarëv had settled on his estate at Penza. VII Herzen never returned to Russia, and Granovskii never saw him again. From time to time they exchanged letters full of warm mutual affection and a deep longing for one another. Herzen's personal pique was not quickly soothed. The tone of his first let ters may be judged from Granovskii's answering letter of 1847 : &gt; I have not answered the majority of your letters because they have had a bad effect upon me. There is a kind of suppressed reproach in them, a hostile arrière pensée* that breaks through at every moment. . . . Your former jibes against those near and dear to you were not offen sive, because there was good-natured acuity in them. But the irony of your letters is offensive, not to pride but to a more vital and noble feel ing. Wouldn't it have been better to write us a perhaps cruel letter di rectly, if you were displeased with us? But you scattered your insinua tions in a letter to Tat'iana Alekseevna [Astrakov], etc.; that was bad, Herzen. Your last few days in Moscow could have shown you that the scenes in Sokolovo left no traces, and how much love and devotion you left behind you. . . . Why then repeat the ridiculous accusations of an absence of active love, of apathy, and the like?18 Apparently no trace of bitterness remained in Granovskii: this same letter breathes a touching tenderness, as do all his subsequent letters. The difference *"Mental reservation."-TRANS.</page><page sequence="27">MICHAEL GERSHENZON, A HISTOR Y OF YOUNG RUSSIA 185 in convictions that lay like an abyss between him and Herzen tormented him, and it was as if he were trying to convince himself that it had disappeared. In the letter of 1849 from which an excerpt has been quoted above, he writes, recalling the arguments in Sokolovo: "That time did not go by without profit to me. I came out the victor over my worst side. Not a trace remains of the romanticism with which you charged me." To his very death he cherished the hope of seeing his friend again; as late as autumn, 1853, he called it his best, most comforting dream. There was much in Herzen's writings abroad which he did not like, but that did not diminish his affection. We do not know Her zen's letters to him,19 but in My Past and Thoughts Herzen says: "If time proved that we could understand things differently, could misunderstand and even wound each other, greater time doubly proved that we could neither part nor be estranged: that death itself was powerless to do that." He relates that he received the letter containing the news of Granovskii's death while he was on his way to Richmond to get a train. He read the letter as he walked along, and at first he could not comprehend it. He boarded the railway car as if he were half asleep and looked mindlessly at the people getting on and off; he was very drowsy and he felt terribly cold. In London he met Talandier; greeting him, he said he had received a letter with bad news: and as if he had just heard the news himself, he could not hold back the tears. "There had been little contact between us lately," he says in conclusion, "but I needed to know that there, far away in our native land, that man lived. "* With Ogarëv, who went off to the country in the fall of 1846, Granovskii apparently kept up an active correspondence during the next few years; in any event their relations remained fraternal and friendly, as before. But later, at the beginning of the 'fifties, serious misunderstandings of a purely personal nature—over and above their theoretical differences—arose between them, caused chiefly by the unfriendly attitude of Granovskii and their other Mos cow friends to Ogarëv's second wife, Natalie Ogarëv-Tuchkov. The reader can find some of the details of this sad episode in her memoirs.21 A whole web of gossip, scandal, and mutual offence enmeshed the friends and kept them apart for a long time. There is no need to dwell upon this episode; to com plete the record I shall cite only the few letters of that time at my disposal which have not previously been published. The following letter from Ogarëv, a rough copy of which was found among Herzen's papers, dates no doubt from 1854 or 1855. *In Herzen's unpublished letter to Evgenii Korsh of 27 December 1855, preserved in the Rumiantsev Museum in Moscow, we read: "Many, very many of the threads that bound me to Russia, and to the life of our friend, have been torn.... 1 thought that in the event of my death I would send Sasha (his son] to Granovskii and I intended to write him of this. Now even that is ruined."20_/\UTHOR.</page><page sequence="28">186 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE Granovskii! In life and in death God is free, the saying goes. In plain language this means that if one does not die today one will die tomorrow. It is sad to die or to know one has died without reconciliation. As a conse quence I am writing; the devil only knows whether this will be a long or a short letter! But I must have my say, so listen patiently. In the days of yore when we last met, you blamed me and my wife for the forced marriage of people who are near and dear to me. Wheth er this accusation was made simply on the basis of sentimental facts or with an admixture of some hostile influence makes no difference. The accusation was made despite the fact that you yourself knew it was ab surd. Ketcher is another matter; the pathological state of his brain has made him play the role of procureur du roi* in regard to his friends. But I did not expect that of you. It is ridiculous to be angry with Ket cher, but it is also ridiculous to put up with absurd affronts. I broke with him inwardly beginning 1847, when he laid an absurd slander a gainst Natasha Herzen on the Silin'kos' say-so. I pity him and love him and am ready for any reconciliation, with no questions asked, and for subsequent offences without any right on his part. On my part there can be no offences, precisely because I love and pity him. Well! And what about you? It is not enough that there was the first absurd accusation, which stunned me—that is not enough. A certain subject with a gigantic intelligence says that my wife says that you—my friend—have ruined me! ! And instead of asking me about it (if spirit were lacking to be indignant at the slander), instead of that—the accusa tion by the subject with the gigantic intelligence is accepted as an axi om! Is this supposed to show love and respect for me? Why, then, send me an oral declaration of love and respect made up for the occasion? I would expect this not from you but from some gentleman with a melli fluous tongue and a rag for a heart. And after that you start saying you knew in advance that a woman would break us up. . . . What is surprising in that, if friendship is going to consist in slandering the woman your friend loves and respects? I would be a scoundrel if in such a case I betrayed the woman for friend ship. Ah! . . . Perhaps the motive here is jealousy? You told me that Ketcher loves jealously, like a woman. A feeling very natural and even poetic, perhaps, in a work of art, but not good in either a woman or a man-like all envy. And a year before that you praised a woman to me for not being jealous! for recognizing the freedom of love! Tell me, which is it with you-also a pathological brain state, or are you swayed by strangers' gossip? I don't know which is best. I even think the former. Be that as it may, through slander Natasha's trip to Petersburg in a "Public prosecutor."-TRANS.</page><page sequence="29">MICHAEL GERSHENZON,^ HISTORY OF YOUNG RUSSIA 187 time of distress was taken as a desire to ruin us.* The fact did not justi fy the misgivings. It will be said that we were lucky to get away with it! But wouldn't it be better to see that the misgivings concerning this trip were false? There are, after all, limits to the instinct of self-preservation! But the upshot was that the trip has been viewed with an air of reproach and chastisement. For what? ... Do you realize that this is something like the behavior of people who hurl filth at a man as he walks to the gallows? Finally I wrote to you. The only answer I received was saccharine protestations of love and respect—invented for the occasion. It would really be better to say that you neither love nor respect me! It would be simpler. I returned to Moscow. You write me that because I did not come to see you, you are both pained and ashamed for me. Who is pained, and how much, in this whole affair, everyone knows in his heart; and who ever is ashamed in this whole affair, it is certainly not I. To persecute with a shameful love is worse than to persecute with hatred. But when you heard (from Kavelin, probably) that I was offended by your failure to answer my letter, instead of frankly confessing that your silence was wrong, you announce (Kavelin told me this and it was confirmed by Madame Bodisko) that you had not written because I show all my letters to my wife. If the first slanders were merely absurd, this slander, Granovskii, is foul, because it was invented as an excuse, and you should really be desperately ashamed. After all this, if I tell you that I have boundless respect for you, I shall be lying. You yourself can see (here is a mirror for you) that this is impossible. But I love you quand même for the memories, for the good moments of our lives, and shall readily gloss over—the crimes. If you intend to persist in these wretched slanders, then forget me, and I shall try to do the same in regard to you. If, on the other hand, you are capable of magnanimous candor, then come to me and say: forgive me! I shall embrace you with warm love as before. Decide as best you can! If the latter, set a time when I am to be at home, and I shall await you with the impatience of first love. Dixi!* Among Granovskii's papers after his death was found an undated and prob ably unsent letter to Ogarëv, which has been published in his correspondence (page 449).23 Evidently it was an answer to a letter from Ogarëv like the one just quoted. "What foul accusation against you did I accept with desperate sentimentalism?" Granovskii asks. "This was in 1850, when Ogarëv, Satin, and A. A. Tuchkov were anested and taken to Petersburg. Natalie Tuchkov, who at the time was not yet married to Ogarëv, followed them. Their Moscow friends, who apparently attributed even the arrest partly to this "il licit" cohabitation, strongly censured her trip. 2 2_ AUTHOR. *["Speak!"-TRANS.] Ogarëv's poem, "To a Friend," written in the 'fifties, may re fer to this episode:</page><page sequence="30">188 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE When did I tell you that different occupations were separating us?

Carol* I love you as much as I can love. I am displeased with you, I have sincere and bitter grievances against you, but the thought of break ing with you is as dreadful as the thought of death. I don't let it enter my head. Your Granovskii. I shall cite in addition some lines from a letter (to Satin) that Granovskii wrote a few months before his death, after his trip to Petersburg in April, 1855 (manuscript): Press the hands of your wife and Ogarëv for me. I shall write him. Tell him that in the moments of painful melancholy from which I am only now beginning to recover, I thought about him much and loved him much. No man on earth is dearer to me than he, and yet our for mer free relationship is gone. In my heart there is much that is unex pressed and much that is hard to express. Perhaps when we meet, in one of those moments when you talk easily and warmly about every thing, the heavy burden will fall from my heart. But when is that meet ing coming? I know only one thing: in the painful and in the joyous moments of my life, Ogarëv's image is my constant companion. There is reason to believe that Ogarév rushed from the country to Moscow when he learned of Granovskii's fatal illness, but he did not arrive in time. At For a long time we divided in two The ardor of the heart and the mysterious trembling of thought, But, evidently, the past was of no profit to us, And all fell silent, like foolish childish prattle. Perhaps, a pity! But friendship did not redeem us. And with an infantile smile, friend slandered Friend! And life passed sorrowfully. Faith in this unsteady friendship also passed. Well, what of it? The weight of mistakes and losses Has not yet led us to the door of the grave, has it?

Until his death Ogarëv kept a scrap of paper on which an unknown hand had written: I am sending you a portrait of Granovskii, who never blamed you for the circumstances that kept you apart in recent years. I met him a few days before his death, and he spoke of you with the most tender amity, with complete readiness to embrace you fraternally, as before, as soon as you should meet. I want my testimony to be some consolation to you for the fact that you did not find our dear friend among the liv ing. March 2. Ogarëv too, mentions the portrait in this verse: As a legacy loss gave to me The portrait of the dead brow; I gaze-as if death had not removed The fraternal image from my heart, The fancy suddenly strikes me This is only peaceful sleep,— He is but asleep, a smile wanders, Again tomorrow he will waken ; The noble voice will sound And he will bring the youth As a cherished gift, his free spirit, Light of thought and ardor of heart.</page><page sequence="32">190 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE ENDNOTES Chapter IV.
