<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. 5, 1989) Reinventing China: The Fifth-Generation Filmmakers1 Paul Clark In the mid-1980s the so-called "fifth-generation" of filmmakers turned Chinese cinema on its head. After three decades of an often unsteady diet of politicized and ritualized movies, most Chinese audiences found the films of this young group of filmmakers incomprehensible and unappealing. The fifth generation's problems of finding an audience were compounded by the rise of television ownership, the increasing availability of television programs and films from abroad, and the growing tendency to find other entertainment. Most Chinese, like their American and Western European counterparts, seemed to prefer, say, a police serial (from Hong Kong) on a small screen at home to a usually demanding story on a big screen. A minority of film-goers, however, like their art-house equivalents abroad, delighted in the challenge of the new films. For the first time in their usually young lives they saw people, events, and an attitude on the cinema screen that resonated with their own experiences. The obvious enthusiasm of foreign film festival audiences for these new Chinese works seemed a puzzle. The international awards suggested that the strong visual qualities of these films could reach across borders. But for the compara- tively tiny Chinese audience who followed these films and were able to see them despite erratic distribution, the new movies were distinctly Chinese films. Their makers agreed. The distinction was one associated specifically with their generation. The aesthetic and political stance of these movies reflected the emergence of this new group. But given its problems finding an audience, the generation's coherence and influence may fade. This article will examine the works of several fifth-generation filmmakers to make a preliminary assessment of the ways in which their films have represented China. It will argue that the filmmakers' and the films' images of China reflect a profoundly ambivalent nationalism. The roots of this ambivalence will be traced in that generation's experience of growing up Chinese in rather special- historical circumstances. The fifth generation are chiefly the members of the first post-Cultural Revolution degree class at the Beijing Film Academy, where they studied from 1978 to 1982. 1 An earlier version of this paper was presented at a conference on Theater and Cinema Arts in Modern China, sponsored by the University of Oslo, September 1988. 121</page><page sequence="2">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers I Huang tudi (The yellow earth, dir. Chen Kaige, Guangxi studio, 1984) was the film that announced to the world the arrival of the fifth generation on China's screens. Its national qualities are obvious: Chen Kaige, Zhang Yimou, and their youthful crew deliberately chose a setting in the heartland of Chinese civilization. The "yellow race" was spawned in the yellow loess earth along the Yellow River. Cinematographer Zhang Yimou's framing of this setting emphasizes the importance of the yellow earth in the lives of the characters. Frequently great depths of loess hillside fill most of the screen, with just a strip of sky at the top. This reversion of the usual importance given the sky draws attention to the peasants' roots in the land. Less obvious is the allegorical discourse of Yellow Earth and its refer- ence to the contemporary condition of China in the world. The film treats the arrival of new, outside ideas in a previously closed-off world. The girl Cuiqiao learns of the different treatment of women in Yan'an and flees her husband to go there. Hanhan, her younger brother, also sees that the new world spoken of by the army man from Yan'an offers the promise of change in his narrow, earth-bound world. The image of his lone figure running against the tide of villagers at the rain-making ceremony toward what he probably imagines is the man from Yan'an is carefully constructed. It presents both the hope of change and the limitations that it must confront. Made at a time when China had begun an unprecedented involvement in international economic and cultural intercourse, Yellow Earth's allegory was not lost on its audiences. Like the Yellow River villagers in the film, Chinese in the 1980s have had their world disrupted by this insertion of outside influences. The profound ambiguity of the ending of Yellow Earth - Hanhan 's vision of the soldier may be an illusion, and Cuiqiao's song that the Communist Party promises a new life is broken off in mid-sentence - suggests something even broader than a questioning of what Yan'an subsequently delivered. The filmmakers seem to suggest that China may find change induced from anywhere difficult to deal with and even impossible to sustain. The distinction between the nation and its political leaders is a central implication of Yige he bage [One and eight] (dir. Zhang Junzhao, Guangxi studio, 1984). The fifth generation acknowledge this film as their first representative work. One and Eight was made by the Youth Film Team that four new graduates of the Beijing Film Academy established at the tiny studio in Guangxi in the spring of 1983. Shaving their heads as a sign of their resolution (it was an all-male team), the crew headed for Ningxia province to shoot the film. Like Yellow Earth , the landscape image of China in One and Eight is of the dry, hard, bleak northwest. There is hardly a single tree in the latter film. Generalizations are dangerous, but previous generations of Chinese 122</page><page sequence="3">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. 5, 1989) filmmakers had usually represented China with a quintessential^ southern landscape. Water, trees, cultivated fields, and cozy settlement had been the norms, seen in such films as the May Fourth adaptations Linjia puzi [The Lin family shop] (dir. Shui Hua, Beijing studio, 1959) and Zaochun eryue [Early spring in February] (dir. Xie Tieli, Beijing studio, 1963), inLiu sanjie [Third sister Liu] (dir. Su Li, Changchun studio, 1960), Li Shuangshuang (dir. Lu Ren, Haiyan studio, 1962), and Xiangqing [Longing for home] (dir. Hu Binliu and Wang Jin, Pearl River studio, 1981). One and Eight, like Yellow Earth after it, represented China in a much less hospitable landscape. Nature is not a friendly element in these films' China: in One and Eight nine prisoners and their Red Army guards trudge through a desert that offers little shelter from natural or the Japanese enemies. The roots of this representation of the national landscape can be traced in the experience of many of the fifth-generation filmmakers. Sent down from their urban homes in 1968 or 1969 upon finishing a couple of years at high school, they generally found life as farmers far from pleasant. Even in the relatively prosperous areas of eastern China, "learning from the peasants" meant hard work, often primitive living quarters, not infre- quent hostility from local people, and general rural unpleasantness. Some- one who has spent time in enforced exile surrounded by "the idiocy of rural life" may be more inclined to represent the natural landscape in the rather hostile terms we see in One and Eight and Yellow Earth. But the harshness of the landscapes in these two primordial fifth- generation films has a deeper significance in this group's representation of China. This level is more apparent in One and Eight when combined with the film's characters and style. For want of a better word, One and Eight seems directly masculine in its harshness of landscape, bluntness of char- acters, and directness of visual form. Compared with earlier films, few punches are pulled in the presentation of the nine prisoners at the center of the film. They include traitors, thieves, deserters, and Wang Jin, an Eighth Route Army man falsely accused of treason. Wang's determination to prove his innocence and his insistence that the other prisoners show some decency toward each other and some pride in their nation win respect from the eight others and from their captors. Eventually their guards enlist them in the fight against the Japanese pursuers. The uncompromising nature of the film lasts to the end (at least in the original version), when a Chinese female medic is saved from rape by Japanese soldiers by being shot by the oldest of the former prisoners. This ending was changed after Film Bureau censorship by having the young woman assisted by the old man in escaping the Japanese. The harsh landscape, and Zhang Yimou's naturalis- tically lit, gloomy, decentered cinematography, serve to emphasize this generation's typical refusal to present attractive characters reaching happy endings. 123</page><page sequence="4">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers The significance of this harsh representation of China seems to lie in a conviction that the nation needs toughness. The soft, watery, friendly landscapes of Jiangnan have not yet appeared prominently in this generation's films. As in the literary and artistic work of the rest of the generation, these films suggest that the world is hostile, and China's place in it far from secured. The fascination with the roots of Chinese culture in Yellow Earth and the brutality of Chinese life represented in One and Eight both are a rejection of the effeteness and softness often associated with Chinese intellectuals, educated in the Confucian tradition. The fifth generation is, of course, the generation of the Red Guards. Mao Zedong, at least in his Cultural Revolution incarnation, was propelled by the conviction that softness was anathema to a strong nation. The toughness of the Y an'an spirit, in sanitized and mythologized form, served as a beacon for the Cultural Revolutionists. In Yellow Earth Yan'an appears, in the waist-drum dance sequence, as an entirely masculine place of great vigor. The sole female character in One and Eight has to be shot to save her from the consequences of her femininity. Judging from their first two major works, the fifth generation's China is a curious place. II Tian Zhuangzhuang's image of China is, if anything, stranger. Tian established himself as one of the major talents of his generation with two films set in non-Han, minority areas of China. Liechang zhasa [On the hunting ground] (Inner Mongolia studio, 1985) is a largely non-narrative work set at a modern though unspecified time among the Mongolian steppe people. The Tibet in Daoma zei [Horse thief] (Xi'an studio, 1985) is even more timeless, although the Film Bureau censors in early 1986 insisted upon a subtitle date. Tian chose one that specifies a setting in 1923. He placed no significance in that particular choice of year, except by its randomness to underline the pointlessness of specifying the film's historical period. Elements in the style of On the Hunting Ground are designed to distance the audience in order to emphasize the otherness in the life and attitudes Chinese audiences see in the film. What story there is concerns a herdsman who transgresses the rules of the hunt embodied in the "zhasa" (rules) set down by Genghis Khan in the early twelfth century. Much of the film's images are of the vastness of the steppe, swept by Tian's camera, as if to suggest on film his own confusion at confronting this different world. Shots of animals being shot and collapsing in quivering heaps - I counted seven deer, two rabbits, and a small duck blasted out of the water, at one viewing - suggest the randomness of Tian's narrative. Tian is more concerned with examining the relationship between people and and the land. His own experience of a little over a year in the 124</page><page sequence="5">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. 5, 1989) extreme northwestern corner of Jilin province close by Inner Mongolia he now recalls as an idyllic period: "There was plenty of open space, a river, horses to ride, friends, and peace and quiet. Horse Thief, with its stronger sense of narrative, is another contempla- tion of what it means to be Chinese through the indirect means of a minority, non-Han setting. The film follows the social ostracism of a Tibetan serf for stealing and his subsequent efforts to rehabilitate himself by plunging into any religious ceremony he can find. Part of the reason for Tian's use of such contexts is simply to be able to get things past the censors that in a Han-based story might prove unacceptable. Chinese filmmakers have been producing minorities films for this reason since the 1950s. But Tian's purpose is deeper than this. The distance these minorities present between their cultures and that of the majority of Han viewers can encourage thought on the differences and the wider significance of the cultural patterns represented on the screen. Tian Zhuangzhuang's minimal narrative and refusal to explain much of what is going on helps reinforce thought in some viewers. Here again is a marked fifth-generation contrast with earlier filmmakers. The latter tended to present the minorities as "just like us," though with a better developed sense of rhythm. Tian's concern is with the relationships between humans, their society, and their gods. But, typically for his films, he offers mere suggestions of the importance of these relations, rather than any conclusions. The film follows the life of Norbu, the thieving protagonist. Tian is quick to point out in interviews that horse theft is still a way of life in the remoter parts of Tibet, where horses can be more valuable than currency. Norbu's troubles get worse with the death of his son. He and his wife go through a pilgimage of prostration to atone for their child's death. Their second son, born when the couple have been exiled from settled society, also succumbs to the deprivation. Norbu's religious devotion cannot change his lot. When described in this way, Horse Thief s allegorical relevance to contemporary Chinese politics becomes clearer. Religious devotion to a god or an ideology can fail its devotees, as Red Guards of Tian's own generation discovered. But Tian Zhuangzhuang's two minorities films have a rather wider reference to the fifth generation's view of China. Like a number of contemporary films set in "primitive" times of as early as the Xia and Shang dynasties, Tian's settings on the periphery of Chinese civilization allow contemplation of that civilization, as it were, "before the fall." From this perspective, literacy, Confucianism, centralized secular politics, and a divorcement from the land are all part of China's "fall." Here Tian's themes are reminiscent of the concerns of the first major fifth-generation films. All 2 Interview with Tian Zhuangzhuang, Beijing, 8 June 1988. There is much of this fondness for the wild, open space of the northern grasslands of China in On the Hunting Ground. 125</page><page sequence="6">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers are set in places far from those usually considered at the heart of contem- porary Chinese civilization. One and Eight and Yellow Earth reflect a sense that China needs not civilization, but toughness, if not brutality, to survive. On the Hunting Ground and Horse Thief imply that "civilization," as it developed through imperial times in China, is a matter less for pride than for avoidance. In an important way the Cultural Revolution, during which Tian's generation attained maturity, laid bare (and even laid waste to) that civilization. Chen Kaige's Hati wang [King of the children] (Xi'an studio, 1987) shares this fascination with what went wrong with Chinese civilization, as system and even as society, during the Cultural Revolution and in a longer perspective. In the film an "educated youth" sent down to Yunnan Provin- ce in the late 1960s is transferred several years later to a village school. There he finds that the children do not have textbooks. They must first copy down the text from the blackboard, even if the contents of the texts are remote from their own experiences. The new teacher changes the teaching methods to enable his students to express themselves in their own ways and with their own words. Soon, the authorities oblige him to leave the school. As in Yellow Earth, a force from outside disrupts local patterns. But the teacher's failure in King of the Children is more obvious than that of the army man in the 1984 film. Narrowly, the film is an indictment of the stupidity of political rote learning and performance in contemporary China. Chen's concerns, how- ever, are as broad as Tian Zhuangzhuang's. King of the Children addresses the meaning of education and of learning to become part of a culture. The emphasis on the natural, uncultivated world and its contrast with settled, human society is central in both King of the Children and Horse Thief. Both these fifth-generation directors suggest that in the culture of China there is something wrong: Chen more or less directly, and Tian by way of non-Han distancing from the familiar. Wu Ziniu, one of the major talents of the fifth generation, has received less international attention than some of his peers. Several of his films have not been made readily available for festival competition and export. His Gezi shu [Dove tree] (Xiaoxiang studio, 1985) had the distinction of being the first fifth-generation film to be banned outright. Officials of the China Film Archive claim that the Xiaoxiang Film Studio in Changsha, which produced the film, even refuses to deposit the solitary print in the archive.3 In that film particularly, and in a couple of his other features, Wu Ziniu reflects views of China shared by his cohorts in the film industry. The fascination with untamed, often waterless, northern landscapes, seen in One and Eight, Yellow Earth, and in Tian Zhuangzhuang's minori- 3 Other archive officials, however, reportedly confirm the director's statement that the archive does indeed hold the film in its vaults in Lintong county outside Xi'an. 126</page><page sequence="7">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. 5, 1989) minorities films, appears also in two Wu Ziniu features filmed in the northwest. Zuihou yige dongri [The last day of winter] (Xiaoxiang studio, 1986) is set in China's "Gulag" in Qinghai. Three young people (a man and woman in their twenties and a young girl) meet on the road on their way to visit their siblings in a labor reform camp. Wu's images of massed, shaven-headed prisoners (digging what could be a mass grave, but is not) living as numbers rather than with names, serve as counterfoil to the three individual tales of social morality he tells when each traveller meets her or his sibling prisoner. The treeless landscape, dotted with earth-walled ruins of apparently ancient cities that surround the modern camp, takes on symbolic significance. All of China's history invests this place with an antiquity that the modern apparatus of state policing has somehow in- herited. All of China's ancient social morality has not prevented these prisoners from coming here. Again, as in Tian Zhuangzhuang's films, distance in an unfamiliar or unfriendly land serves to emphasize the general relevance of the themes to contemporary Chinese society. Wu Ziniu's Dove Tree , made before The Last Day of Winter, is a more direct reflection of fifth-generation attitudes toward the nation. Its sup- pression before release showed how still unwelcome such attitudes were in some circles. The sensitivity of the Sino-Vietnam border conflict made Dove Tree particularly vulnerable to censorial suspicion. But the original story for the film had been published in early 1985 in Shiyue [October] literary magazine without attracting much attention. The cultural climate at the time was warmer than usual. Ye Nan, the rather more engaging twin brother of Bai Hua, writer of the maudlin and suppressed Kulian [Bitter love; more correctly, Taiyanghe ren (The sun and the man)] (Changchun studio, 1980), adapted his own story in four days. The leaders of Wu's Xiaoxiang studio approved the script in just two days and allocated some of the considerable revenues Wu's previous film, a wartime drama, had earned the studio. Wu and his crew filmed entirely on location, as most fifth-generation directors do, and used synchronous sound recording throughout, a first in Chinese cinema.4 The film presents the experiences of a squad of a dozen young Chinese border guards who have been cut off from their main unit. In the course of a single day, from sunrise to sunset, four of the soldiers encounter a Vietnamese nurse. Surrounded by thick fog and the forest, the soldiers from the two countries find they share a common humanity. The nurse tends the wounds of the soldiers. They talk about their pasts, youthful hopes, and fears. Dove Tree's problem, in the eyes of the censors, was that its suggested humanity came before other considerations, including patriotism. The 4 This background to the making of the film and its nature is drawn particulary from a joint interview with Wu Ziniu and Ye Nan, Beijing, 11 May 1986. 127</page><page sequence="8">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers film's suppression brings to mind the attacks on "bourgeois humanism" in Chinese literature in the 1950s and 1960s. Then the notion of a supra-class morality was anathema to insurgent literary critics. In 1985, Dove Tree's humanity affronted the official, forced patriotism associated with an unpo- pular border war. As one of the crew remarked in an interview a few months later, if the film had been set in the War of Resistance to Japan it might not have run into trouble.5 Its reported artistic distinction - synchronous sound recording reinforces its naturalism - served also to draw attention to the film. The censors, in the Hunan provincial party apparatus and in Beijing, took the simplistic view that Dove Tree was an anti-war film. Deng Xiaoping himself is reported to have seen the film and to have wondered afterwards if its director might like to make his next film in Hanoi. The film's significance, however, lies beyond the war context. It is a distinctly fifth-generation work. Their personal experiences of being sent away from families and city homes in the late 1960s to labor in the countryside could not but have encouraged thought about China's state of political morality. A human concern that had as little to do with class background and ownership of production as possible was a powerful notion fostered in exile. Wu Ziniu's own sister went insane in the late 1960s, and he had spent three years in a semi-militarized unit in southern Sichuan hauling boats on the Dadu river. Wu's rejection of simple patriotism in Dove Tree reflects his condition as one of the angriest of the fifth-genera- tion filmmakers. Wu Ziniu played it safer when he next ventured into a war setting by selecting the more distant War of Resistance to Japan. The film, however, took over a year and a half-dozen re-editings to receive his army studio's and the Film Bureau censors' approval. As in Dove Tree, war in Wanzhong [The evening bell] (August First studio, 1988) provides an opportunity to directly address questions of patriotism and a humanity that ignores natio- nal borders. In late 1945, somewhere in the Northwest, five members of the Eighth Route Army are kept busy burying the war dead. Their efforts include both the Chinese dead and those of the Japanese Imperial Army. From a Japanese prisoner of war they learn of a squad of 32 Japanese soldiers still holed up in a cave in the hills, unaware of Japan's defeat. The process of securing the Japanese squad's surrender severely tests the five Chinese soldiers' patience and humanity. They discover that the Japanese are still holding several Chinese civilian captives, whom they have tortured and, in the case of a woman, raped. Eventually the Japanese squad leader leads his troops out of the cave, but commits hara lòri suicide. The leader of the Chinese five manages to rescue the original Japanese prisoner from the cave before the ammunition stored inside it explodes. 5 Interview with Zhang Li, Dove Tree's cinematographer, and a member of the Beijing Film Academy's class of 1978-1982, Beijing, 10 May 1986. 128</page><page sequence="9">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. S, 1989) of the Chinese five manages to rescue the original Japanese prisoner from the cave before the ammunition stored inside it explodes. In a film about sacrifice and death, Wu Ziniu falls firmly on the side of a shared humanity rather than narrow patriotism. A dramatic prologue presents the self-immolation of a mass of Japanese soldiers, mostly from Hiroshima. This exercise in patriotism contrasts with the measured treat- ment the Chinese soldiers offer to former enemies. The Chinese leader lost his entire family eight years before to the Japanese. Yet he proceeds to bury the Japanese dead and carefully controls his emotions at the cave mouth, even when a half-naked Chinese woman is sent out of captivity. There is something of the Harp of Burma here, a resonance encouraged by the burial of war dead. The first part of the film, after the immolation prologue, is curiously empty of much political or even social context. The five soldiers go about their work in a typically fifth-generation barren landscape that might exist on the moon. They come across their Japanese prisoner in what looks like, but is never directly identified as, a Buddhist temple. Evening Bell's story and treatment thus represent vividly fifth-genera- tion ambivalence about China. On the one hand there is a pride here that the Chinese soldiers are different from the Japanese, who are only too willing to seek to atone their disgrace through self-destruction. The Chinese are presented as decent human beings, even in the face of consid- erable provocation. On the other hand, this decency is not particularly associated with being Chinese. The absence of much social reference emphasizes the universal qualities of the heroes' actions. Although the men wear faded Eighth Route Army badges on their sleeves, there are no Chinese flags flying or any particularly Chinese locations, apart from the Buddhist-seeming temple. In contrast, the Japanese are consistently presented with emblems of their nation. In the fifth-generation conscious- ness, an inherited pride in being Chinese seems to share space with a sense of being part of humankind. Chen Kaige's first film after the ground-breaking Yellow Earth ad- dressed issues of patriotism directly and came up with a similarly ambivalent response. Ostensibly Da yuebing [The big parade] (Guangxi studio, 1985, released 1986) could not be about a more patriotic subject: the prepara- tions by a troop of air force soldiers to participate in the People's Republic of China thirty-fifth anniversary parade on National Day in Tiananmen Square. But Chen's focus is elsewhere. The relationship between individual and the collective is of interest to us all. For young Chinese who ex- perienced the collective and individual extremes of national catastrophe encouraged for a time by the national leadership, these issues are invested with a particular pertinence. The Big Parade reflects on youth and service in a profoundly ambivalent manner. 129</page><page sequence="10">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers Two elements structure the film: the highly regulated training on the parade ground and the naturalistic, individuated lives of the soldiers back in the barracks. On the parade ground everything must be perfect. The slope of the soldiers' rifles, the fall of their shoulders, and the height of their raised boots from the ground must all be uniform. At one point the squad stands at attention in the summer heat for three continuous hours. Invitations to rest if they feel unwell are bravely ignored, even as several soldiers fall in a faint. Toward the end of training their officer announces that they have each worn out four pairs of boots and marched a total of almost ten thousand kilometers, or the equivalent, he notes, of the length of the Great Wall. The lives of the soldiers off the parade ground serve as an ironic counterpoint to the discipline of the training itself. Zhang Yimou's camera adopts a confrontational, distanced and static stance for the parade ground, and a freer, crowded, more fluid style for the barracks. Deliberate over-ex- posure and the tumult of people passing in front of the camera suggest to an extent rare in Chinese cinema the space beyond the film frame. Six characters are the central focus. They include the training instructor, whose strict fairness is tested by the debt he owes one of the soldiers, who carried him to safety at the Vietnam border. The soldier is bow-legged, so even- tually the instructor must remove his name from the final cut of parade participants. The squadron leader sees the parade as a last chance to achieve something during his rather placid army career. Three younger soldiers undergo the rigors of training and self-sacrifice. They include a cadet anxious to enter officer training school, a country cadet with a stutter, and a kid who likes to think he has lots of street smarts, even if the main street in his hometown is a dirt road. When word comes that his mother has died, the stutterer refuses to return home for the funeral, saying it was her dying wish that he participate in the Beijing parade. To return to the funeral would be unfilial. By parading, he can fulfill obligations to both family and nation. The process by which these six individuals, along with the others, are molded into a parading machine forms the core of the narrative. Chen Kaige seems to have a profoundly ambivalent attitude toward this process. He appears both impressed by the way in which the soldiers devote them- selves to preparing for the parade and somewhat disturbed by the individual sacrifice this requires. Taken on its own, the sequence at the end of training, when the soldiers write their names and those of their colleagues who have been rejected on a red flag, is a paean to national glory. But the ultimate impression from The Big Parade is the suggestion that such sacrifice, while noble, is misplaced. The ways in which the Tiananmen parade is constructed on the screen are highly ironic. The sloping of French horns rather than rifles, the slow-motion swirl of women soldiers' skirts, almost funereal music, and the ninety-six steps the squad takes across the 130</page><page sequence="11">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. 5, 1989) square all serve to question the value of the exercise. This pride in being Chinese but questioning of the political circumstances in which China finds itself is typical of the generation from which these filmmakers come. Younger people may not be as enthusiastic about the first element in this duality as their elders. War and sacrifice offer another opportunity to examine what China means to the fifth generation in Tamen zheng nianqing [In their prime, lit. They are still young] (Xi'an studio, 1986). Directors Zhou Xiaowen and Fang Fang (Guo Fangfang) faced the frustration of having the Film Bureau's approval for domestic and international exhibition withdrawn after a few months in the spring of 1987, reportedly because objections to the film came from the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army. The generals found the tone of the film unacceptable, for in their eyes it offered no revolutionary heroes and might affect recruiting efforts.6 The film has yet to be released. In Their Prime's problems with the authorities arose because Zhou and Guo chose to address the question of patriotism and sacrifice not in the relatively acceptable, remoter past of the War of Resistance to Japan, but (like Wu Ziniu's Dove Tree ) in the setting of the continuing contem- porary border clashes between China and Vietnam. The film presents the full horror of the existence of a squad of eight men in a cave on a shell-blasted hill near the border. Into the story at several points are inserted moments from the visit to Beijing of the squad leader to see the wife of a comrade. The sweaty naturalism of the border cave is contrasted with the distancing, expressionist presentation of the Beijing sequences. In Beijing the squad leader persuades his comrade's widow not to abort the dead man's child. The style of representation of In Their Prime situates the film firmly in the fifth-generation oeuvre. Rarely has war been depicted with such directness as in the scenes in the border cave. Space is cramped, supplies arrive erratically, and brief episodes of desperate fighting are punctuated by long periods of waiting for the enemy to make a move. Conspicuous in many shots is a chalked map of China within a heart shape on the wall of the cave. At one point the soldiers dig up human bones in a cliff-side trench, prompting viewers to wonder how many generations have died in battle before this group. Vietnamese fighters appear at three points in the film. A soldier who is barely more than a child seizes the youngest squad member and tortures him with knife cuts across his chest before he is shot by another Chinese soldier. In an interlude in the fighting the Chinese men gaze down at the river beneath their cliff-side cave as Vietnamese soldiers clear away their dead comrades. The third appearance of Vietnamese is the most significant 6 Interview with Zhou Xiaowen, Xi'an, 17 June 1988. 131</page><page sequence="12">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers in relation to the question of patriotism in In Their Prime. One of the Chinese soldiers suddenly confronts a young woman in a trench. The two enemies stare at each other, unwilling to act out the implications of their battlefield confrontation. The Chinese soldier sees that the woman is carrying a young baby on her back. As he turns to walk away, however, he hears her preparing to throw a hand grenade. He spins around and shoots at her out of frame. We hear the sound of the baby's cries and presume that the mother is dead. Who will look after the child? The episodes set in Beijing serve to emphasize the film's concern with humanity more than patriotism. The first such sequence starts with a cut from wounded soldiers at the border to the dismembered limbs of several dolls lying on the floor of a kindergarten classroom where the heroine works. Later, the squad leader insists on taking her away from the grim waiting room of the abortion ward, where the cries of pain of other woman can be heard. In the final Beijing sequence, the soldier and the widow visit the Museum of Revolutionary Military History. Here the emotional dis- tress of the widow is conveyed through a deliberately distorted soundtrack, in which she repeats, "I don't know." The irony of this confusion (specifi- cally over her husband's battlefield death and over not ending her pregnan- cy) in a nationalist setting of cannon, missiles, and other weapons of war reaches its height in a final museum shot from high above the statue of Mao Zedong at the entrance as the two visitors leave. In the next shot the couple stands in a traffic island (prominently shown to be labelled "safety island," in perhaps another deliberate irony) at night surrounded by anonymous, unnatural-sounding traffic on Chang'an Avenue. Like the men in the cave at the front, the couple, even in the heart of the city, is cut off and isolated from society. War has done that to both groups, even as it is being fought for the sake of society. The final sequence of In Their Prime has a similar setting to the ending of Xie Jin's archly patriotic Gaoshan xia de huahuan [Wreaths at the foot of the mountain] (Shanghai studio, 1985), but could not represent better what the fifth generation has done to the film image of China. The Beijing widow has come to visit her husband's grave. She and the platoon com- mander climb over the vast hillside graveyard, with its serried ranks of new graves. Xie Jin treats a similar setting as the occasion for further glorifica- tion of the patriotic sacrifice of the fallen. In Zhou Xiaowen and Fang Fang's film, in contrast, the graves serve as a final symbol of loss. The couple seems unable to find the particular grave among the mass of headstones. The screen fades to darkness and then is filled with flames. A children's a cappella chorus sings: "Close our eyes, open our hearts. Let our souls soar into the blue sky." The effect is more emotional than these words suggest. The contrast with previous filmmaking generations' representations of China is striking. Xie Jin's third-generation image in Wreaths at the Foot of the Mountain is patriotic, communal, and apparently makes no distinc- 132</page><page sequence="13">Modem Chinese Literature (Vol. 5, 1989) tion between nation and Communist Party. The suggestion in In Their Prime, as in Wu Ziniu's Dove Tree and Chen Kaige's Big Parade, is that individual interests need more recognition. Patriotism should acknowledge a humanism that extends beyond national loyalties. Ill The fifth-generation film representation of China has been complex and ambiguous. One somewhat mechanical way to analyze the attitudes is to separate out three levels: state, nation, and culture. For any generation in China, the existence of this last level complicates its view of being Chinese. The fifth-generation filmmakers share with the rest of the population the widely recognized crisis of faith in the state that took root in the 1980s. Since 1949, drawing an effective distinction between the state and the Chinese Communist Party has been meaningless. For Chinese intellectuals, the Party onslaught against non-conformity started in 1951 with the cam- paign against the film Wu Xun zhuan [The life of Wu Xun] and intensified in the anti-Hu Feng campaign three years, before the full force of the Anti-Rightist reaction in 1957-1958. The fifth-generation filmmakers are inheritors of this relationship between state and society. Compounding the disillusion was this age group's particular ex- perience in the late 1960s and 1970s. These filmmakers were generally in their early teens at the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. All had little choice but to participate at high school in the assault against their teachers and other established figures, in the manner of their older siblings in the Red Guards. Some of these filmmakers lost parents to Red Guard captivity. Starting in 1968, many future filmmakers found themselves dis- patched to the countryside in necessary exile from homes and schools. For many, young and old, this period included something like exile from culture. Judging from the literature and films of the fifth generation, the impact on young people, whose grasp of their culture was perhaps less fixed than that of older comrades, seems to have been greater. Most of the future fifth-generation artists left the countryside in the early 1970s, returning to the cities to work or entering the army. The effect of these two decades of political upheaval was perhaps most devastating for the fifth generation, for this group, educated entirely after 1949, like their older siblings, formed the backbone of the Cultural Revolution and were its most obvious heirs. After 1969, and more especially after 1976, a sense of wasted effort, of having been used, and a conviction that the world had profoundly changed was particularly strong among this group. Film school after 1978 provided an opportunity to make up for lost time, and a means (usually indirect) to express their strong, untutored feelings about 133</page><page sequence="14">Clark: Fifth-Generation Filmmakers When boldly asked if they are nationalists, the fifth-generation film- makers generally look embarrassed and usually deny the notion. In this, these young Chinese are similar to their intellectual counterparts else- where in the world, where nationalism has become a bad word. But a viewing of The Big Parade, for example, despite the deliberate ambiguity in its construction, suggests that a pride in being part of the Chinese nation survives. It would be more remarkable if it did not. So, too, Yellow Earth's careful grounding (in all senses of the word) in the Shaanxi loess plateau indicates a sense of national origin. Wu Ziniu's Chinese soldiers in Evening Bell do not act in the frenzied way that the defeated Japanese act, which is cause for quiet approval of the Chinese way of reacting to defeat. The chalked map of China within the heart-shaped outline on the wall of the cave in In Their Prime is not simply an ironic touch. But for all Chinese, the boundaries between pride in the nation and in the culture are blurred. Yellow Earth's setting is in the birthplace of the people who over millenia created Chinese culture. The primitiveness of the place highly offended conservative critics of the film. But the filmma- kers' emphasis was deliberate. An urge to get back to cultural basics animates much of the writing and art of this generation. Tian Zhuang- zhuang's two minorities films suggest a fifth-generation disquiet with their culture. By going to the fringes of Sinic civilization, Tian implies (particu- larly in Horse Thief) that there is something wrong with Chinese culture: it has fallen from a state of grace. The landscapes of many of this generation's films are not the soft, wet, cultivated environs of the South, but harsh, dry, untamed wilderness in the Northwest. The suggestion is that Chinese culture needs toughness and a breaking away from cultivated, overworked "civilization." Chen Kaige's third film, King of the Children, directly presents this need for the sponta- neous and untrammeled. Like most fifth-generation films, King of the Children ends ambiguously. The "king" walks away, through a fossilized forest of anthropomorphic trees. They seem to represent history observing his apparent resignation to the burden of the past. That his efforts at a different approach to the acculturation of his students will come to much seems unlikely. This ambiguity, confusion, and pessimism about their nation and culture should not surprise students of the fifth-generation films. In large part stemming from their particular histories in the 1960s and 1970s, these people have a relatively broad perspective on being Chinese. Moreover, they represent a generation that is more open to international influence than any previous group of Chinese film artists. To a much greater extent than any earlier Chinese filmmakers, they are part of world cinema. As they continue to use the international language of cinema to reflect on the state of China, their image of China will continue to change.

To those who feared he might be losing his soul to gain an audience, Tian responded typically (and facetiously): "Why not?"
