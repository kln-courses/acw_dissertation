"Disagreement is not easy to reach," Father John Courtney Murray writes in We Hold These Truths. All too often during the decades since Leo XIIFs encyclical Aeterni Patris neo-Thomists have occasioned only misunderstanding rather than disagreement. All of us, whether Catholic or not, whether neo- Thomist or not, are greatly in debt to Father Murray for articulating some parts of neo-Thomism so well that now, at last, some of the issues are clear. Agreement and disagreement have become possible. Among the best things in the book are those passages in which Father Murray outlines the structure of arguments between contemporary neo-Thomists and non-Thomists. For example, he admits that since "right reason" cannot be identified, the whole traditional manner of stating the philosophy of natural law is now useless (pp. 82-85). This is a courageous admission, however belated. The admission is only incomplete insofar as it leaves unexplained the meaning of "right reason." Recta ratio is not a term which occurs in Plato or Aristotle. It is a Scholastic term. In the Middle Ages the Church often conceded autonomy and truth to philosophical conclusions. But if such conclusions contradicted the teaching of the Church, then the Church naturally felt that there must be some- thing wrong with the reasoning behind the conclusion. The conclusion could not, in short, be the work of "right reason." Right reason, then, is not a philo- sophical concept at all. Father Murray - like many of us - is worried by the failure of American democracy to develop a rational and coherent public doctrine concerning foreign affairs and communism. He rightly points out that there is need for such doctrine. He goes on to propose a new kind of natural law doctrine, but also argues for the traditional natural law doctrine on the grounds that whenever its enemies think that they have buried it, it revives. So there must be something to it. Father Murray never looks at the other side of the coin: whenever traditional natural law appears on the scene, it is quickly buried. So there can- not be much to it. - But this is only a debating point. Apart from this "histori- cal" argument, something much more serious and fundamental inclines Father Murray to neo-Thomist natural law. His inclination is due to the conviction that, since foreign affairs and communism present problems, reason must be able to produce a solution. To every problem there must be a solution. And if the [347]</page><page sequence="2">The Christian Scholar solution cannot be arrived at with the méthode of non-Thomist reasoning, why, then, that (modern) reason must be wrong and we do well to turn to a more common-sense, ideological and anthropomorphic kind of reason. Funda- mentally, then, Father Murray makes reason "omnipotent" by making it less strict and more ideological. Thomist practitioners of teleological argumenta- tion should be able to explain how something not yet in existence (the final cause) can really be a cause and have real effects. Father Murray never answers this question; he does not even raise the question. He simply proposes the cozy, neo-Thomist kind of reason to the cold modern world and invites us to make ourselves at home. He ignores the centuries of philosophical development from Duns Scotus to the present. In the days of Aquinas teleology was, perhaps, less of a problem because one could always argue that the final cause really does exist as an archetype and exemplary cause in the mind of God, and so it can have real effects. Thomist teleology, often described simply as educated common sense or anthropomorphism, is also divine neo-Platonism. This unarticulated theological element is not the only one of its kind in We Hold These Truths. Confronted by the need to modify and reform democracy, Father Murray frankly says of one desirable reform (limited war capability) that to deny its possibility is to succumb to some sort of determinism in human affairs (p. 271). The unstated major premise seems to be that every desirable reform is possible. All the dictates of morality and reason must admit of histori- cal realization. To deny that, it seems, is "determinism." But from the point of view of pure logic it is equally deterministic to say that the demands of moral reason and the possibilities of reform are always and only such that the former are included in the latter. If pure logic cannot explain Father Murray's optimism, then perhaps some aspects of Catholic doctrine will help to explain his apparent rejection of "determinism" and his real espousal of an optimistic determinism. It seems to be Catholic doctrine that only God knows future contingent events. From this teaching Catholics frequently draw the dubious conclusion that man knows nothing about the future except that it is entirely contingent. Such Catholics may be reading things into Catholic doctrine which are not there. If we hold that only God knows future contingent events, the only conclusion which follows is that man does not know them. Even so, future contingent events are one thing and trends of social development another. The Catholic Church has never condemned the theories of development of Vico and Spengler. Theories of this kind are generally neglected by neo-Thomists. They find it sufficient to say that history is essentially contingent, which paints the future in rosy colors because - if anything is possible - then everything is worth trying. The optimism of the early Middle Ages admirably suits the activism of America» Neither outlook cares for the qualified and moderate theories of social develop- ment which have been proposed in the last few hundred years. Aristotle, one [348]</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews suspects, would have taken Vico and Spengler very seriously precisely because they proposed biological analogies and limited determinism. The neo-Thomist neglect of modern ideas about history is of a piece with their neglect of the history of philosophy. Even an author as learned as Father Murray is, it seems, typically neo-Thomist in this respect. He asks, for example, whether the people of the West can dispute the Communist thesis that freedom means insight into the necessities of history (p. 236). His question is indeed profound; it is marred only by his implication that the Western conception of freedom has nothing at all in common with the Communist one. In fact Communists get their conception of freedom from a "materialistic" inversion of Hegel; and Hegel only modified the Aristotelian ethics of human self-realization by introducing into it the dimension of time. Hegel, like Aquinas, was an Aristotelian. Aquinas revived Aristotle in the context of faith; Hegel revived Aristotle in the context of the modern concern with history. For a philosopher of development Aristotle very strangely ignores the dimension of time, as Spengler points out. That omission of Aristotle's was corrected by Hegel. Hegel agreed with Aristotle (and Aquinas) that the goal of human morality is the life of reason. Pure thought thinking itself is not only metaphysics; it is the Divine. Unlike Aristotle and Aquinas, who thought of this ethical goal in individualistic terms, Hegel thought that the realization of reason by reason cannot be accom- plished in one lifetime. It requires, he thought, ages of philosophical evolution. Perhaps this fundamental agreement between Aristotle, Aquinas and Hegel helps to explain why neo-Thomism is no longer the dominant view. That agreement gives added meaning to the dictum which Father Murray quotes to the effect that Saint Thomas was the first Whig. Given Saint Thomas for a starting point, we are bound to get Hegel.</page></plain_text>
