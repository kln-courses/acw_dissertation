<plain_text><page sequence="1">LECTURES ON HUMANISM, with Special Reference to Its Bearings on Sociology. By J. S. Mackenzie, M. A., Glasgow, Litt. D., Cambridge; Professor of Philosophy in University College, Cardiff; author of "Outlines of Metaphysics," "A Manual of Ethics," and "An Introduction to Social Philosophy." London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., I907. Professor Mackenzie uses the term humanism in a sense dif- ferent from that which Professor James and his friends have</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews. 247 tried to attach to it, and a nobler one. He employs it to denote not so much a school as a tendency of thought-the tendency to explain the universe in the light of and from the point of view of human nature-to employ in that explanation the humanistic concepts of purpose, end, good rather than the naturalistic con- cepts of matter, motion, quantity. It is thus contrasted with both of the opposite tendencies to which he gives the names naturalism and supernaturalism. It is eventually admitted that the humanis- tic explanation of the world is not entirely adequate by itself. A true account of the universe as a whole must take account of and include those aspects of it which are revealed by physical nature and its laws, and it must end in the recognition of some being or beings greater than the individual human animal: so far it must include the points of view characteristic both of naturalism and supernaturalism. But in the final explanation- such explanation or comprehension of the whole as is possible to the human intellect-the humanistic tendency should, in the author's view, play the largest part. Even science cannot, at least when it enters the biological region, get on without the con- cept of end or purpose, while supernaturalist explanations of the universe are after all based upon facts of human nature; so that in the last resort a true philosophy cannot but be humanistic, though not in a narrow or exclusive sense. At bottom this rather elaborate account may be said to come to this: a true view of the universe must be teleological and ethical. The book represents the substance of lectures given by the author as Dunkin lecturer in sociology at Manchester College, Oxford. Its main object is to suggest the kind of light which philosophy, conceived of in this way, may be expected to throw upon the problems usually discussed by sociology and sociologists. After explaining the contribution of Humanism to philosophy itself, Professor Mackenzie goes on to develop its bearings upon politics, economics, education, religion. The lectures naturally assume very largely the form of a criticism upon various mistaken or one-sided tendencies of thought-popular, and in the narrower sense of that term "scientific," thought-which arise from the neglect of the philosophical point of view. Under the head of politics we have a defence, within its proper limits, together with a criticism of the democratic idea. "It is of the essence of humanism to think of man as a being with an end. This end, moreover, is not something external to his nature,</page><page sequence="3">248 Interrnational Journal of Ethics. but rather something which exists for himself, and which is real- ized, in the main, by the unfolding of his own being. It is the growing consciousness of this, more than everything else, that has made it impossible for men to recognize any purely external rule, and that has often given to the democratic ideal a force almost amounting to that of a religion. . . Now it is hardly possible to look at human life in this way without claiming for every one who is human that he should have some effective share in the regulation of his own life; and in practice this almost in- evitably means, among other things, that he should have some real voice in the government of his country. When, however, this point of view is adopted, it becomes at the same time clear that what is really essential is not that the voice of each should tell with equal weight, but rather that each should find his place as an organic member in the progressive life of humanity" (p. 98). As regards education, we find a vindication of the im- portance of "humanistic studies combined with a much-needed protest against the idea that mere linguistic instruction (be the tongues ancient or modern) is really humanistic at all. Under the head of religion the most striking of Professor Mackenzie's ideas is perhaps his contention that "anthropomorphism" in its strict and literal sense is not really an outcome of humanism in religion, but on the contrary is in the main a naturalistic tendency. The Jewish religion with its stem interdiction of visible representations of the Deity was far more truly humanistic than the religion of Hellas, whose humanly envisaged deities were at bottom personifi- cations of natural forces. For a true humanism "we single out humanity from the rest of the universe, as containing within it the highest that we know; but in humanity also we have to make a similar selection of that which is worthy of our devotion. This inner core, the ultimate divine spark, would appear to be what we understand by the supreme good, or the moral ideal; and thus the religion of humanity would seem in the end to be identified with what has recently been set before us in a simpler and more definite way, as Ethical Religion!' (p. i83). An elaborate criticism of this position would be out of place here; I will only remark that, while I am in full sympathy with the general spirit of Professor Mackenzie's "humanism," its application to re- ligion would seem to me to result in a more distinctly "personal" theism than he seems disposed to recognize. In what sense can the universe be interpreted in the light of the human conception</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews. 249 of "end," unless this end is present to a consciousness which works towards this end? All that Professor Mackenzie has to say upon social problems seems to be very well worth saying and united to its original pur- pose. It is eminently calculated for instance to correct the naive idea of the Spencerian, or the modern disciple of M. Durkheim, who thinks that all sociological problems can be solved by mere evolutionary studies of origins, or by the manipulation of statistics, without any preliminary thought as to the nature of the human mind, its ideals, its relation to the universe which it studies. But the lectures range over so large a variety of topics, and treat of each so briefly, that a detailed account and criticism of them would be difficult, even if there were much (from the present writer's point of view) which called for criticism. To readers of this JOURNAL the principal interest of the volume will be in the light which the two concluding chapters on "The Limitations of Human- ism" and the "Implications of Humanism" throw upon the author's own philosophical position. The general outcome of the first mentioned chapter has already been indicated. In the second we have first some remarks on the importance of the idea of causality, and the tendency of natural- istic views of the universe to resolve all distinctions into quantita- tive distinctions. The only point which seems to be questionable in Professor Mackenzies treatment of the matter is a certain vagueness about the relation of "quality" to "goodness." It is un- deniable that "the conception of preferability seems to involve dif- ference of quality (p. 2i6)," but there is a tendency to speak as if differences of quality necessarily involved differences of value or "preferability :" yet surely we might recognize differences of color, and even a scale of colors from red to violet, without regarding red as preferable to violet or violet as preferable to red. I de- siderate here a franker recognition of the doctrine so admirably insisted on by Mr. G. E. Moore, that "the good" is a distinct concept not resolvable into any other. Then there is a much- needed protest against that mechanical view of causality which is still dominant in Oxford: "If, however, we recognize ends as determining factors in the real world, it is clear that we must, in some degree modify the ordinary conception of causation. . . . The fact is that the ordi- nary conception of causation has been completely subverted by the progress of the sciences; so that it is hardly necessary to attack Vol. XVIII.-No. 2. 8</page><page sequence="5">250 International Journal of Ethics. it with philosophical criticism" (p. 220). This could not be better put; but alas, ancient prejudices die harder in Oxford! There at least, people will not see that the universe as a whole cannot be regarded as purposeful or as good, if the end at no point whatever influences the succession of events. Professor Mackenzie goes to the root of the matter in a pregnant note, wherein he remarks: "It must surely appear, on reflection, to be a very curious prejudice which leads the ordinary consciousness to suppose that a thing is sufficiently explained if it can be shown to have been pushed, but not if it can only be shown to have been drawn. Yet, even in the physical world, the conception that has thrown most light on the general structure of the system in which we live is the conception of a force of attraction operating, if not at a distance, at any rate through a distance. . . . The Platonic view, which I am here seeking in a manner to revive, is to the effect that the attractiveness of the good may in the end be at least as satisfactory a principle of explanation as either physical attraction or transference of motion" (pp. 222-3). My only difficulty is to see how Professor Mackenzie supposes this conception of the good to act. The only mode within our experience which can and does exercise causality is through a conscious will; yet elsewhere Professor Mackenzie repudiates the inference that all causality must be that of a will. Some day Professor Mackenzie will, I hope, develop the interesting hints which he has here given us into a complete metaphysic. I must not, however, pass over without notice the most novel of the suggestions which are outlined in this book. He has attempted, with all proper apologies for lack of space to develop it, a new solution of the time problem. "The simplest way, and I think a quite true way of putting it is to say that the order of time must be accepted as real, but that its transcience must be regarded as illusory. . . . We must, that is to say, think of reality as perma- nent, the past and the present portion existing quite as truly as the present. But this need not lead us to deny the reality of the time-order. The real universe may be a series of events, start- ing from a definite beginning and leading up to a definite end (or rather, perhaps forming a closed circle in which the end and the beginning are identical), even if we deny that the process dis- appears when the end is reached" (pp. 225-7). A note adds "the last number of the series can hardly be thought of as fol- lowed by nothing or by an empty time. It seems necessary,</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews. 25I therefore, to think of it as being immediately followed by the first number; and we are thus led inevitably to the conception of revolving cycles." But surely an event which is at once after and before the same event involves a contradiction. Or, if that end of the first series (and beginning of the second) is regarded as not really the same event as the beginning of the first series, but only a similar event, the old difficulty comes back again: an endless series of similar cycles of events is as great a difficulty as an endless series of totally dissimilar events. Professor Mackenzie, like other ex- plainers of the time difficulty, has, I fear, simply cut the knot by transforming the time-series into some other kind of series. A series of events in which the future is looked upon as existing- now in the present-"quite as truly as the present" has nothing in common with time as we know it. Doubtless all ways of look- ing at time involve contradictions; but, where we have to admit contradictions, we are still confronted with a problem, not a solu- tion. Doubtless there must be some way of resolving or "tran- scending" them; but that solution is not provided by just saying "Be ye transcended." I may perhaps be allowed to add a line or two by way of reply to a criticism of Professor Mackenzie upon myself. "When Dr. Rashdall, for instance, affirms that 'a better universe is im- aginable' one would like to know whether the better universe that he imagines includes those human excellences which are only known of through their development and exercise in relation to the difficulties, dangers, and imperfections of the world in which we are. If not, how can he be sure that the universe that he imagines is really a better one" (p. 236) ? I answer that I know it by means of that moral consciousness which is the only source of knowledge about good and evil, better or worse, that I or anyone else can appeal to. Not all the "imperfections" of the world have any immediate relation to the human excellences, and my point may perhaps best be seen in reference to these. If before the evolution of man there had been as much pleasure as there was without any of the pain that actually occurred, I cannot help pronouncing that such a universe would have been a better universe than the universe we know. Professor Mackenzie will reply that it is impossible that there should have been the pleasure without the pain, and impossible that the human excellences should have come without the previous animal suffering. I have no</page><page sequence="7">252 International Journal of Ethics. doubt of it; but had it been possible, I cannot doubt that it would have been better without denying the validity of the moral, and of a great many other judgments that we actually make. I have not denied that the universe is the best of all possible universes: an imaginable universe is not necessarily a possible universe. Professor Mackenzie has written a suggestive, stimulating, and thoroughly interesting book. He has given us emphatically a multum in parvo; the best compliment that one can pay to such a book is to say that it makes one look forward eagerly to a fuller development of its leading ideas, chiefly, that is, a development of the leading ideas contained in the concluding chapters, such as he promises us in the preface.
