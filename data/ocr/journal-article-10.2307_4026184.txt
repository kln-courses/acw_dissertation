Like any other maturing academic discipline, the history of science has begun to provide itself with plenty of high-quality textbooks and works of reference. The enormous, and enormously useful, Dictionary of scientific biography (16 volumes, Charles Scribner; New York, 1970-1980) has recently been completed; and now we have a Dictionary of the history of science to go with it on our library shelves. Compiled very rapidly (the editors tell us that it was first planned as late as July 1979), this volume is made up of contributions from around 100 historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science; and it provides the first handy guide to the contemporary state of the discipline. The dictionary concentrates on the history of scientific ideas. These are discussed in something like 700 separate articles, which together with an even larger number of short definitions and single-line entries constitute the bulk of the volume. The reader is directed through the entries by an analytical table of contents, by a thorough system of cross-referencing between the articles, and by a biographical index of scientists at the end. How well does the dictionary work? To answer this question, I looked up a major scientific concept to see where it would lead. Turning to the entry under 'natural selection, I found a concise summary of the idea and of the way it was</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 317 conceived and received in the nineteenth century. The cross-referencing system directed me not only to a fairly predictable series of entries on the history of evolutionary thought but also to two articles, 'anthropomorphism in science' and 'metaphor in science'. In this way, I learnt about such things as positivism and the internalism versus externalism debate as well as the achievements of Darwin and Wallace. This example gives a fair indication of the scope of the dictionary, which contains more entries on the philosophy of science than it does on physics, and a great many more on historiographical and sociological issues as well. The net result is a product which reflects the current state of the art so accurately that it is likely to become an interesting historical document in its own right in years to come. In the meantime, it will be an invaluable aid to students and teachers of the history of science, who will find in it a convenient source of information as well as a concise summary of contemporary historiographical debates. Whether it will really help to demystify science for lay people, as the editors hope, is rather more doubtful. Certainly, it stands no chance of doing so unless it is re-issued very soon in a cheaper paperback edition. JOHNR. DURANT University College of Swansea</page></plain_text>
