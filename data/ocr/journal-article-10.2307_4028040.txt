Throughout the nineteenth century evolution theory and the possibility of reconciling it with Christian doctrine was a matter for free discussion among Catholics, but suddenly towards the end of the century the attitude of the Roman doctrinal authorities hardened. Nothing public was done but theologians, upon hearing that their theses had been examined in Rome and judged to be untenable, began to withdraw their books from sale, make public retractions and cease to discuss the subject. What processes lay behind these events, and who were the main persons responsible for what was effectively a U-turn in the official church attitude of Pope Leo XIII's pontificate, are questions that have been unanswerable until now. However, in 1998 the archives of the Holy Office, now renamed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, were opened to scholars so that it has become possible to clarify these particular mysteries. This article does that for the first time, and the story it has to tell provides insights into the dynamics of cultural and intellectual interactions within the Catholic Church community and with the rest of the world. This Catholic story should be seen as something more than a struggle that took place within the ranks of the Catholic Church: it was an episode in the history of science and its cultural relations in the modern world. The possibility of reconciling Christian doctrine and evolution theory was a subject that was widely discussed in Catholic circles during the closing years of the nineteenth century, and there were many who argued for the possibility with enthusiasm. The reverberations of these discussions were inevitably felt in Rome and they placed a demand on the doctrinal authorities, in the first instance the officials of the Sacred Congregation of the Index of Forbidden Books, to respond in some way. Theologians and historians have always been struck by the seemingly enigmatic response of Rome when it did come: the authorities were obviously unhappy with the propagation of 'Christianized evolution', but it seems that they were not willing or able to say so straight out and in public. It was common knowledge that some kind of pressure was exerted by the Roman authorities on two notable writers and teachers, the French Dominican theologian Pere M.-D. Leroy and the American Professor of Physics at the University of Notre Dame, Fr J. A. Zahm, a priest of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. It was also known that Bishop Bonomelli of Cremona in northern Italy came under pressure in some way, while the English Benedictine Bishop Hedley was serious y embarrassed along with many other Catholic theologians, journalists, teachers and pastors when they found they had been supporting an opinion that was now * School of Science and Technology Studies, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia.

But what finally caused the Congregation of the Index to act and what action it did take remained a secret to all but a very restricted circle. In 1917 the Sacred Congregation of the Index was fused with the Holy Office, and in 1998 the Archives of the Holy Office (now renamed the 'Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith') were opened to scholars, thus making available for the first time documents that show why the attitude of the doctrinal authorities changed, why they continued to act so cautiously and who were the persons mainly responsible for their change of policy. In this study I aim to tell that story from what is revealed in these archival documents. In the closing years of the nineteenth century the Catholic Church community was seriously disturbed by the first rumblings of what has come to be known as the 'modernist crisis', a widespread state of alarm provoked by scholars who were increasingly adopting principles and methods from secular history-writing and the natural sciences when treating theological subjects, with profound effects on the presentation of traditional doctrines and on biblical scholarship: Church dogmas were presented as products of evolutionary processes, as was also the Church institution itself. Such scholars were seen as the most dangerous modernists, but 'modernism' took many forms depending on the perceptions of its various opponents, so that the meaning of the term became very imprecise and came to be applied to any and every suspected or alleged deviation from accepted orthodoxy. Modernists were feared and pursued as enemies within the ranks of the faithful, more dangerous and insidious than all the enemies outside the church. This modernist crisis was a final eruption within the ranks of the Church community of the long struggle against modern secular society that the Church's leadership had been engaged in during the nineteenth century. Resistance to the modern world had been a feature of the long pontificate of Pope Pius IX (1846-78) who stated a number of times, and notoriously in the Syllabus of Errors (1864), that there was no possibility of reconciliation between the Church and modern society. The Pope's attitude was affected by his experiences during his own pontificate, especially the assassination by radicals of his prime minister, Pellegrino Rossi, and his enforced flight for refuge to Gaeta in the Kingdom of Naples (November 1848). Henceforward, locked in battle with Italian liberals and anti- clericals in his struggle to preserve the papal temporal power, he was firmly persuaded that the principles of the French Revolution were the main cause for the destruction of the entire social, moral and religious order. Pius IX called on Catholic intellectuals and men of letters to assist him in his fight against modernity; he pleaded for 'men who are endowed with piety, ability, and sound doctrine.. .to defend by their writings our August religion'.1 His summons was answered by the Catholic press in France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Central America, England and Italy.2 Many of the main players in the story we have to tell were members of a group of 1 Pius IX, Quibus quantisque malorum (1849), as reported in Anon., 'Pius IX and the Civilta' Cattolica', Dublin Review (1866), 7, 414-32; cf. also Anon., 'La Civilta Cattolica nel 1860', Civilta Cattolica (1859), 4, 641-56; Anon., 'Per l'anno cinquantesimo della Civilta Cattolica', Civiltai Cattolica (1899), 6, 7-28. Referencing to Civilta Cattolica will not be uniform in style since the method of numbering issues and volumes varied during the nineteenth century. The authors of Civilta Cattolica articles were always anonymous, but a key to authors' identities was provided with the triennial indexes. 2 Anon., 'Pius IX and the Civilta Cattolica', Dublin Review (1866), 7, 414-32, 414.</page><page sequence="3">Catholic Church politics and evolution theory 83 Jesuit writers who were brought together by Pius IX and instituted as a college, conferring on them considerable authority and commissioning them to publish La Civilta Cattolica, a journal to be dedicated to the defence of Catholic truth and of the positions of the Church and the papacy.3 The Pope commended them for the fact that they have nothing nearer at heart than, by their learned and erudite elucidations, manfully to protect and defend the Divine truth of our August religion, and the supreme dignity, authority, power and interests of this Apostolic See.. .to expose and resist particularly the many errors of our most unhappy age - its aberrations, and its poisoned writings, so pernicious both to Church and State.4 Since this group of Jesuits and most especially their successors in the college of writers will appear in a very poor light as the events unfold, it is important to emphasize that they were a small group of Jesuits only and that they had exceptional influence in Rome at the end of the nineteenth century. It should not be inferred that these men were in any way typical of their order generally, either then or since, for they most certainly were not - Jesuits in France, for instance, who were their contemporaries, were far less reactionary.5 At the end of Pius IX's pontificate the Catholic Church was strengthened within, centralized on Rome, but isolated in a largely hostile world, lacking the tools and capacity to react effectively against the rationalism of the day and unable to respond creatively to the radical developments occurring in the natural and historical sciences. In this climate liberal Catholics found life difficult. Some, however, including people in positions of prominence in the Church, were aware of the need to change. Catholic higher education was improving in quality and depth with the spread of Catholic institutes in Paris, Lille, Anger, Lyon, Toulouse and Louvain. Bishop Hedley in England urged the need to educate Catholics in places like Oxford so that they would be able to make reasoned responses to the new discoveries and ideas they encountered in the world of learning.6 Most importantly, Pope Leo XIII, who succeeded Pius IX in 1878, was convinced that a different approach was needed, and he actively encouraged scholars to engage with the secular world, especially the world of the sciences. This change of direction was widely welcomed and in many parts of the world educated Catholics made a sincere effort to reconcile Catholic doctrine with conclusions drawn from geology, palaeontology and archaeology, to name some of the more theologically pertinent sciences that were rapidly gaining their independence from Christian doctrine. They tried to show that Catholicism, despite what critics were claiming, was not contrary to the modern mentality and even 3 Anon., op. cit. (2), 414 ff.; Anon., 'Per l'anno cinquantesimo', op. cit.

(2), 415. 5 Etudes, the French journal published by the Jesuits, carried articles written in a very different spirit to those of their Roman Jesuit counterparts; e.g. the extended review by A. Hate of F. H. Reusch, La Bible et la nature, Paris, 1867 in Etudes (1868), 2, 458-71, 934-53; also B. Gaudeau, SJ, 'Evolution et naturalisme', Etudes (1898), 75, 118-25, who defends St George Mivart and J. A. Zahm from detractors. Also Zahm himself mentions with warm approval a pamphlet by Fr Dierck, SJ, L'Homme-singe et les pre'curseurs d'Adam en face de la science et de la the'ologie, cf. J. A. Zahm, Evolution and Dogma, Chicago, 1896, 362 n. 2. 6 His efforts were crowned with success in 1895 when Pope Leo XIII issued a decree relaxing the ban on attendance by Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities; cf. A. Cramer, OSB, 'The foundation of St Benet's Hall', in Benedictines in Oxford (ed. H. Wansbrough, OSB and A. Marett-Crosby, OSB), London, 1977, 235-55.</page><page sequence="4">84 Barry Brundell attempted to engage the new sciences in the Catholic cause. They found themselves a little hampered in the long term by Pope Leo's promotion of neo-Thomism as the philosophy that would enable Catholics to achieve this reconciliation between doctrine and the secular sciences,7 but that was not to be an issue for some years to come. In the meantime liberal scholars felt much supported by the Pope's enthusiasm and open-mindedness. But the rearguard was strong everywhere, especially in Italy and particularly in Rome, where some of the most active resistance to Pope Leo's new direction was expressed in La Civilta' Cattolica (hereafter CC). Leo is reported as lamenting on a number of occasions, and not in a particularly private way, the repressive attitudes to scholars exhibited by people around him, and among these he clearly included members of the CC college of writers. He requested that scholars be treated with courtesy and in ways that would cause minimal damage, not by condemnations and decrees.8 He resisted his own cardinal advisers, for instance the Jesuit Cardinal Mazzella, who, it is reported, made quite a scene when the Pope energetically refused to have the writings of Mons. D'Hulst of Paris put on the Index of Forbidden Books.9 Admittedly, we have to rely on Mons. D'Hulst's own account of this episode, so some colouring of the facts may be suspected. More reliable, perhaps, is the report from Bishop Le Camus that Fr Brandi SJ (one of the more actively reactionary members of the CC college of writers) spoke to the Pope in 1899 about having certain scholars reported to the Holy See, and the Pope replied that he was fed up with these strange executions of great workers of the church and that they should simply give those who go too far a charitable warning through their respective superiors. Independent testimony was also given to the truth of this report.10 It is against this background that we should examine the reception of evolution theory and the misfortunes of Frs Leroy and Zahm, as well as the discomfort of so many other prominent Catholics who took a conciliatory line towards the secular sciences. While the challenges to traditional Christian understandings concerning the origins of the universe and of humankind posed by nineteenth-century developments in the earth sciences and biology caused serious difficulties for all regular believers, the intellectual leaders and opinion-makers - teachers, writers, men of science, religious journalists - felt especially obligated to seek to resolve the tensions and preserve a coherent Christian world- view. They wrestled with all the major questions: How much time could they concede to geologists for the formation of the Earth? What were they to make of the extraordinary antiquity being attributed to the human race? How could they respond to the theory of the evolution of biological species, above all when that theory was applied to the origin of the human species? In face of reliable scientific evidence they were forced to reassess many of their most hallowed doctrines and foundations for belief: their traditional ways of interpreting and using the sacred Scriptures; their previously never-questioned biblically based story of the origins of the universe and of the human race; their understanding of 7 Leo XIII, 'Aeterni Patris' (1879), in Enchiridion Symbolorum Definitionum et Declarationum de Rebus Fidei et Morum (ed.

Educated Catholics, faced with reliable scientific evidence that seemingly conflicted with religious beliefs, came up with a range of solutions that differed little from those arrived at by their counterparts of other religious denominations, but the ability of Catholics to respond in a reasoned fashion to the challenges varied. In England, where there was a tradition of liberal thinking supported by journals edited by educated converts from Anglicanism, the response was frequently marked by considerable scholarly independence. A critique of Darwin's theory entitled 'Difficulties of the theory of natural selection' appeared in 1869 in a series of three articles in the influential, semi-popular Catholic journal the Month, and the very first words of the first article indicate the surprisingly irenic tone of the whole series: 'Mr Darwin's theory of "Natural Selection" is perhaps the most interesting theory, in relation to natural science, which has been promulgated during the present century.' The author of the articles was not named, but it later transpired that they had been written by St George Jackson Mivart, and two years later the same articles reappeared in expanded form in Mivart's first book, On the Genesis of Species, one of the most influential Lamarckian responses to Darwinism."2 The Catholic press praised his work; so did influential Catholic intellectuals, including Cardinal John Henry Newman; in 1876 he was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy by Pius IX, and in 1884 he was made professor of the philosophy of natural history in the University of Louvain upon the invitation of the Belgian bishops.'3 It was, on the contrary, frequently repeated by theologians, especially towards the end of the century, that evolution theory was a matter for free discussion, the usual limitations being taken for granted - one would not as a Catholic believer accept a version of the theory that conflicted with Christian beliefs. The reception of Mivart's work by the Catholic world clearly supports that conclusion. The CC writers, however, were never tainted with liberalism, and their response to evolution theory in its various versions was consistently negative and anti-conciliatory. Fr Pianciani wrote a series of articles for the journal in 1860 and 1861, in which he declared the necessity of maintaining the strictest fixity of species: he allowed at most for extinction 11 Studies of the impact of nineteenth-century scientific developments on Christian belief abound.

His articles were directed against Lamarck's transformism, which for Pianciani was a materialist theory since it explained evolution as a process that relied on the powers of nature and resulted in the metamorphosis of pre-existent beings. He declared that transformism was rejected just as strongly by natural science as by religion and sound (i.e. Aristotelian or Thomistic) philosophy, and for evidence he cited the judges' report to the Academy of Sciences of Paris on the prize-winning paper, 'On the laws of evolution of the organic world during the formation of the crust of the Earth' by H. G. Bronn. He noted that the judges were Elie de Beaumont, Pierre Flourens, Isidore Geoffroy de St Hilaire and Adolphe Brongniart."4 The presence of Isidore Geoffroy de St Hilaire (1805-61) on the committee hardly supports Pianciani's claim that transformism was rejected as strongly by science as by religion, for Isidore was a thorough-going supporter of transformism, only less extravagant in his theorizing than his father Etienne. Nor could Pianciani cite Bronn (1800-62) himself, nor Flourens (1794-1867), nor Brongniart (1801-76): though they all supported fixity of species theories, and though Flourens is reported to have heaped Gallic scorn on Darwin's Origin of Species,"5 they all allowed much more room for modifications than did Pianciani. Pianciani stated his view in the conclusion to his discussion: We are content...to believe that man has always been man the way the Creator made him, just as the apes have always been apes, and the other animals have not undergone metamorphoses but each species has remained just as the Creator has willed it to be from the beginning.16 Pianciani saw little difference between the theory of Lamarck and that of Darwin, since 'he [Darwin] also thinks that the diversity of zoological characters is the product of gradual modification'.17 Italian responses to Darwinism usually remained at an abstract philosophical level, with the discussion centred on evolution in general, and especially evolution of the human species,18 and Pianciani articulated a typical Italian Catholic clerical response. Total rejection was the constant, one might say 'knee-jerk', reaction of CC to all theories of evolution. Only the tone became more strident with the years as other writers continued the work of Pianciani after his death in 1862. What is noteworthy is the silence of the official guardians of Catholic orthodoxy right through to the 1890s: there had been no authoritative pronouncements, nor was there any position that could be described as the official Catholic position on evolution theory.

The first moves to limit discussion were made in 1894 when the book entitled Evolution des especes organiques (1887), written by a noted French theologian, M.-D. Leroy, OP, who endorsed the theory of Mivart, was denounced to the Sacred Congregation by M. Chalmel."9 The Consultors examined the book and rejected the accusations in toto, advising that they were based either on misreadings of Leroy's text or on presumptions that the book of Genesis must be interpreted according to the literal meaning - 'which is not correct', wrote Fr Teofilo Domenichelli, one of the consultors, who went on to affirm that no one would hesitate to reject M. Chalmel's doubts as utterly groundless.20 One would have thought that the case would be dismissed at that point, but in fact the very opposite occurred: the Congregation then subjected the book to its own scrutiny, a strange turn of events indeed. As the same Fr Domenichelli recorded, the Prefect of the Congregation decided to broaden the examination beyond the accusations of M. Chalmel and to take in the work as a whole, not only the first edition of 1887 that had been denounced, but also the second edition entitled L'Evolution restreinte aux especes organiques (1891), 'in order' as Fr Domenichelli explained, 'to make it a more complete and just judgment'.,21 At first glance it would appear that this passage to a new examination was entirely the initiative of the Sacred Congregation - clearly it was not the response to a formal denunciation by a third party - but there were other people who were not members of the Congregation and who were able to exert a special influence on the Congregation's judgments. I wish to argue in this paper that the people who exerted this kind of influence on the emerging official position concerning evolution theory were the group of Roman Jesuits already alluded to, almost all of whom belonged to the CC college of writers. In the new, more comprehensive, scrutiny, Leroy's work was found wanting for reasons very different from those that had been alleged by Chalmel. One consultor, Fr Buonpensiere, advised that the work was rather dangerous.. .the philosophy in it was a thousand miles distant from the teaching of St Thomas Aquinas...the connection of mitigated evolutionism with Divine Revelation.. .espe- cially in respect of the formation of the body of Adam, is erroneous and cannot be held.22 However, the consultors were not in agreement, nor were they enthusiastic for a condemnation of the work or of the author, whom they esteemed as a theologian of great virtue and learning, and a member of the noble Dominican Order. They expressed concerns about the hurt that could be caused, about the fact that theologians of weight could be offended. Nor were they in agreement among themselves that evolution theory necessarily led to a negation of the spiritual soul created by God. They generally urged 'un 19 Archives of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (ACDF), Cicognani I, 86, 1-2.

But they did agree that some action had to be taken. Their final judgment was that it was inopportune to publish a condemnation. Leroy was to be warned not to profess any more what he had published and he was to be ordered to withdraw from sale copies of his books that were still unsold and to make a brief retraction of his erroneous opinions. The judgment was recorded in a handwritten memo from the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation: The author is to be warned as follows: the doctrine of the book, or rather the doctrine of evolution, is unsustainable, for it is in itself contrary to science and faith. It is condemned by true ontological and empirical science: ontology, because the type is immutable, incapable of all evolution either towards the greater or towards the less; empirical science, because of the phenomenon of hybridism which keeps the living species distinct. Evolution theory is temerarious and anti-Christian when applied to the human body, given that the Fathers and Sacred Scriptures speak of the formation of the body of man in a language that proves it is immediately formed by God.23 Leroy's retraction duly appeared in Le Monde on 4 March 1895 in the form of a brief letter in which he explained that he had written what he had written with the sole purpose of defending the Christian faith. He had striven to take what was plausible in evolution theory and use it to defend revealed truth. However, he had learned that his thesis concerning the bodily evolution of man had been examined in Rome and judged untenable; hence, he declared, 'I disavow, retract and repudiate all that I have said, written and published in favour of that theory' and expressed his intention of withdrawing L'Evolution restreinte from publication. The first evidence of the CC group's involvement in these proceedings is found in the very wording of the memo of the Cardinal Prefect, specifically in the fact that it reflected articles in CC that had been written by Fr Francesco Salis-Seewis, SJ, and which Fr Brandi, SJ, who was very active in Rome at the time and who had earned the rebuke from Pope Leo XIII already mentioned, cited as primary references for CC's 'demonstration of the incoherence of evolution theory with traditional Catholic teaching '.24 CC had been arguing for decades that the doctrine of evolution is 'contrary to science and faith', so much so that this was almost a refrain in their writing, but only Salis-Seewis had used the terminology ' ontological' and 'empirical' in the discussion of evolution theory: one does not find these terms in other Catholic writings on the subject. The fact that these very terms are found in the cardinal's memo is a firm pointer to their origin in CC and to the influence of the CC group on the outcome of the Leroy investigation. The archival documentation of the second case, that of Fr J. A. Zahm, CSC, to which we now turn, yields further evidence 23 ACDF, Cicognani I, 127. 'Temerarious', meaning 'rash' or 'reckless', is applied in authoritative Catholic Church documents to teachings or ideas that seem to evacuate the Christian message; it is a low-level censure and not an official condemnation since the authority pronouncing the judgment does not have grounds sufficient to assert that the offending theory is definitely anti-Christian. The memo is undated but was written some time after 8 December 1894 when the last of the consultors' reports was completed and before February 1895 when Leroy was called to Rome to receive the verdict. 24 F.

Fr Zahm was Professor of Physics at the University of Notre Dame in the United States, a popular lecturer on the topic 'science and faith' and author of several books on the subject that appeared in rapid succession between 1894 and 1896.25 It was the last in the series, Evolution and Dogma (1896), in which he enthusiastically promoted Mivart's theory, that got him into difficulties. He claimed in this book that it was permissible for a Catholic to hold that the body of Adam evolved from the body of some anthropomorphic brute animal. In true modernist fashion he claimed that evolution is a good theory but, since it is captive of the adversaries of religion, the materialists, the agnostics and atheists, who are using it against the Catholic faith, we must liberate it and show that it can be of inestimable assistance in the cause of good science and religion. He did not want to enter the scientific debate, he said, nor did he want to affirm that the theory was true. Rather, he claimed, My sole, my ardent desire, has been to show that there is nothing in true science, nothing in any of the theories duly accredited by science and warranted by the facts of nature, nothing in Evolution, when properly understood, which is contrary to Scripture or Catholic teaching; that, on the contrary, when viewed in the light of Christian philosophy and theology, there is much in Evolution to admire, much that is ennobling and inspiring, much that illustrates and corroborates the truths of faith, much that may be made ancillary to revelation and religion, much that throws new light on the mysteries of creation, much.. .that exalts our ideas of creative power and wisdom and love, much, in fine, that makes the whole circle of the sciences tend, as never before, ad majorem Dei gloriam.26 Evolution and Dogma was an international best-seller, and it was immediately translated into Italian. CC was enraged.27 They lamented that this publication was hailed as the most memorable event of 1896 and were especially upset that well-known Catholic journals gave it fulsome reviews. This was all typical, according to CC, of the spirit of mistaken conciliation shown by certain schools that had been forming in both the old and the new worlds in these years. Evolution, CC proclaimed, was a tissue of vulgar paralogisms, arbitrary suppositions unsupported by facts and indeed contradicted by them, fantastic aphorisms and subterfuges that are a disgrace to the seriousness of science, and they declared Zahm's book not only dangerous but downright insidious. Evolution and Dogma was denounced to the Congregation of the Index on 5 November 1897 by Bishop Otto Zardetti, former Bishop of Minnesota, later Archbishop of Bucharest but now in retirement since June 1895.28 In his denunciation the sole supporting references the bishop cited were the review by Brandi in CC, the articles in CC by Salis-Seewis already mentioned and which were cited by Brandi as the primary references for CC's demonstration of the incoherence of evolution theory with traditional Catholic teaching, 25 J.

In his report he also cited Brandi's review in CC and no other supporting references.30 The indications that CC were deeply involved in the turn against evolution by the Roman authorities keep presenting themselves. The consultor's report was supposed to be highly confidential, privy only to those persons of the Congregation to whom the Cardinal Prefect chose to divulge it, yet it seems fairly obvious that CC knew more than other people about the contents of Fr Buonpensiere's report. In the course of his assessment of Zahm's work Fr Buonpensiere used the unusual term disinvoltura (lack of restraint) to describe the belated author's attitude: 'con una disinvoltura tutta fenomenale' ('with quite phenomenal lack of restraint ').31 That unusual word turned up again in Brandi's second piece on Zahm's book in CC, which was written after Buonpensiere had submitted his report to the Prefect of the Congregation; Brandi described the author's attitude as characterized by a 'disinvoltura veramente Americana' ('a truly American lack of restraint ').32 Brandi's use of that precise term could hardly have been a coincidence, and it seems to indicate rather clearly that he knew the contents of Buonpensiere's highly confidential report. Fr Buonpensiere's advice was that [since] it seems to me to be Catholic doctrine that God immediately and directly formed Adam from the clay of the earth... [I judge that] the book is a continuous apologia for a doctrine that is contrary to the Catholic faith, and it does not seem to me that it could be corrected - it needs to be completely rewritten... [I] recommend that he be treated as Leroy.33 He recommended that the Congregation send a strong message to all the Catholic world: In order once and for all to make it publicly known to Catholic naturalists that it is not licit to profess that the body of Adam originated immediately not from the clay of the earth but from the body of some anthropomorphic brute animal, I propose that the Sacred Congregation issue a condemnation of the following proposition, or of some similar proposition: 'God formed the body of Adam not immediately from the clay of the earth but out of the body of an anthropomorphic brute animal which he had prepared from inferior matter by the forces of evolution. '34 The Congregation did not accept the consultor's proposal to issue a public condemnation. They chose the more private procedure of sending a decree of personal condemnation to Fr Zahm through the Superior General of his order.35 Zahm withdrew the English version of his book and wrote to Alfonso Galea, the translator of the Italian edition, a sad, heroic letter instructing him to use all his influence to have this edition withdrawn from sale also, saying that they could both thank God that they had laboured only for His honour and 29 S.

The letter is dated 16 May 1899 and was published in the Gazzetta di Malta of 31 May 1899, from which source the ever-alert CC reprinted it in full a month later.36 The tolerance threshold for speculations about a Christian evolutionism had fallen considerably after the Leroy case and while the Zahm examination was still proceeding; this was made clear by the hasty retreat of Bishop Bonomelli of Cremona. He had made a simple allusion to Darwinism and to attempts to Christianize evolution theory in an appendix to his book Seguiamo la ragione (1898),37 but he did not condemn the practice, and that was judged to have been a serious omission. Though Bonomelli was not formally contacted by the Sacred Congregation, he was persuaded by 'friends who had sufficient competence because of their knowledge and authority' to make a public declaration distancing himself from the theory.38 The Archives of the Holy Office conserve a copy of Bonomelli's letter containing his public repudiation of the theory in a cutting from the Lega Lombarda of 25-6 October 1898, where it was first published.39 CC again promptly and 'with pleasure' reported on Bishop Bonomelli's act of repudiation and reproduced his letter in full, and once again they let slip indications that they had more knowledge of what had been transpiring within the walls of the Congregation than other people. In the course of his declaration Bishop Bonomelli had written, 'Aware that the theory had not till now been condemned'; to these words CC made the revealing precision: '[not] by a public act' ('[non] con un atto pubblico')."4 This correction indicates that CC knew very exactly the state of play since they could formulate with juridical precision the Congregation's attitude to evolution theory after its decision not to take public action in the case of Leroy, even though it was persuaded it had to do something to prevent the propagation of a teaching which it judged to be contrary to science and religion. Certainly CC knew more about all that was happening behind the closed doors of the Sacred Congregation than Bishop Hedley in England, who found himself humiliated by them on account of their better knowledge. Bishop Hedley had given a favourable reception to the books of Zahm and Leroy, particularly to that of Zahm. He had written articles in the Dublin Review, of which he had been editor before being nominated a bishop, and in these articles he had urged the probable truth of the theory of evolution theistically interpreted. His chief concern was the welfare of Catholic university students. He wrote, [one who] carefully studies the subject will probably conclude that he would be shutting his eyes to scientific truth if he did not admit evolution as a useful, and probable explanation and coordination of the facts. As to the metaphysical deductions, made by unbelieving scientists in the regions of theology and mental science, he can be a good evolutionist without giving up one iota of his faith or his Catholic philosophy.41 36 Anon., 'Contemporanea', in Civilta' Cattolica (1 July 1899), 125. 37 G.

Spencer Jones, which had been subsequently published in the columns of many Catholic and other journals. This letter, in the words of Fr Brandi, 'Casts doubt on the accuracy of our [CC's] information and conclusions concerning the case of Fr Leroy.'44 In his offending letter Bishop Hedley had dared to criticize CC for their claim that the theory of evolution is to be held 'temerarious' without citing any decision of the Roman Congregations, and for speaking only in a vague way about 'the competent authority' in the case of Fr Leroy. The bishop's understanding of the situation was that the authority in question was no one more elevated than the Superior of the Dominicans and that the censure on the opinion of Leroy in no way emanated from the Holy See. The Roman authorities, he was convinced, had not believed it opportune to condemn Leroy's theory. Bishop Hedley was arguing against CC's claims on the grounds of the knowledge that they were entitled to have, and if everyone was playing fair he should have been vindicated. But CC knew more than the bishop, and so Brandi wrote triumphantly in CC, It pains us to have to say it but the bishop has been wrongly informed: the 'competent authority' was none other than the Holy Office. And if the bishop were to write to that competent authority he will receive, we are certain, though perhaps in a confidential manner, information that it was not possible nor permissible for us to give to our readers.45 In this riposte to Bishop Hedley CC again revealed their hand. It is quite clear that they knew more than the bishop knew and, it seems, more than anyone outside the restricted circle of those who had a right to know, namely the members of the Congregation, Fr Leroy himself and his religious superiors. The depth of their information concerning supposedly confidential particulars is impressive. CC knew that the Sacred Congregation had decided that evolution theory was temerarious and that it had advised Leroy of that judgment, and they knew that evolution theory had been condemned privately and 'not by a public act'. Not only did they have this inside knowledge but it is also indicated that they had a strong influence on the workings of the Congregation itself. I believe that they knew what they knew because they were working very closely with the Congregation itself and with its consultors, so much so that for much of the process against evolution theory they were actually providing the bullets that the Congregation was to fire. As we study this series of events which were of lesser importance in comparison with other preoccupations that were causing serious tension in the Catholic Church in those years - in comparison with the challenges of the galloping developments in biblical studies, for instance, and in comparison with the political, social and intellectual upheavals that were convulsing Italy and the papacy - we cannot but be impressed by the persistence and power of the reactionary and repressive forces that were active throughout the pontificate 42 S.

It is evident, also, that Rome, dominated as it so much was by these forces, was not reflecting at all the widespread more liberal, even moderately liberal, attitudes and views of the Catholic community. That dissonance between the centre of Catholicism and the periphery left the Roman authorities with two possible courses of action: either they had to convince the more liberal people that they were wrong, or they had to silence them with the weight of authority without convincing them and thus run the risk of provoking in the Church community a crisis of confidence in the leadership at the highest levels. It is now history that Rome took the latter course at that time and for the next ten to fifteen years. One question that begs for an answer is, why was it all done so quietly, almost surreptitiously? Why did the Congregation not come out with a public condemnation of these attempts at reconciling evolution theory with doctrine? If they were firmly persuaded that they were temerarious, as appears from the Leroy case and the instructions of the Congregation to that author, why did they not say so for the benefit of all? The consultors in the Leroy case expressed their fears of giving offence to and rousing opposition from many 'weighty' theologians if they were to do something like that, and this fear points to a serious defect in their whole way of operating: they had reached their verdict in a very private process without wide consultation and so they had good reason for fear on those grounds. Another reason for not acting publicly was opposition, at least in the case of Zahm, from several American bishops, especially O'Connell, Gibbons and Ireland, who were commuting between the United States and Rome in an attempt to forestall the condemnation of Zahm and of another ecclesio-cultural phenomenon called 'Ameri- canism' (the alleged excessive openness to the principles on which modern America was founded).46 The bishops were unsuccessful on both counts, but even when they found that action had already been taken against Zahm they did not cease exerting what pressure they could.47 This story harmonizes very well with what scholars have generally agreed about the influence of the Roman Jesuits at the turn of the century: how they were largely responsible for turning back the movement, which was encouraged by Leo XIII, towards making peace with the sciences, how it was especially they who convinced the Pope and his Curial representatives that those who were moving in the direction the Pope had indicated were in fact a danger to the Church. They forced a U-turn in papal policy, and some scholars whose contribution has since been officially recognized, most notably the biblicist Marie- Joseph Lagrange, OP, along with the less renowned Frs Leroy and Zahm and Bishop Hedley, were made to suffer on account of it. Many at the time attributed this reversal not only to the Pope's advanced age (he was an octogenarian) but also to an increased influx 46 Americanism was a movement which took hold in the Catholic Church in the United States in the 1890s and spread to the Continent. Its followers advocated openness to American culture and acceptance of its fundamental assumptions which were rooted in Puritanism and the Enlightenment. Its promoters were highly accepting of American culture and accommodating to modernity, and advocated for the church everywhere acceptance of the principle of religious liberty, the separation of Church and State, social concern and improved relations with other Christians. By 1898 many of the movement's adherents were behaving like radical reformers and the movement was condemned by Rome in January 1899. Their programme in its essentials was officially embraced by the Catholic church in the Second Vatican Council (1962-5). 47 F. Turvasi, op. cit.

Kraus, who kept a diary during these years, wrote, Leo XIII is more and more entirely in the hands of the Jesuits. Rampolla with Mazzella the Jesuit Cardinal and Fr Brandi rule now, and to all appearances they want to exploit the time to have a new Syllabus [of Errors] promulgated before the end of the century.48 Today scholars attribute much of the opposition of Rome to the sciences at the end of the nineteenth century, especially towards the use of historical-critical methods in biblical studies and towards most other liberal movements in the Catholic Church at that time, to the Roman Jesuits and their theology. The historian Roger Aubert traces their growing influence on papal decisions and those of the Roman congregations back to the pontificate of Pius IX and to the CC, which was everywhere considered to be the unofficial organ of the Holy See. Aubert stated, 'It is certain that in all fields of ecclesiastical politics, organization, Catholic action, theology and spirituality, it was the Jesuit line, especially the Roman Jesuit line, that was increasingly the one adopted.'49 But their influence did not last. As the twentieth century wore on it became clear that the traditionalists had been able to halt Leo XIII's programme of reconciliation with modern scientific culture for a short while only. Subsequent official statements of the popes and other official teachers in the Catholic Church have reflected a gradual easing of remaining concerns about theories of evolution and their potential impact on Catholic doctrine. The Pontifical Biblical Commission in 1909 expressed no repugnance for evolution as such but was concerned about the historicity of the Genesis account of the origins of the human race.50 The same Biblical Commission in 1948 expressed a much more sophisticated understanding of history.51 In 1950 Pope Pius XII, in his encyclical Humani Generis (Of Human Kind), stated that the teaching of the Church leaves the doctrine of evolution of the human body from already existing and living matter as an open question for experts, while the Catholic faith requires that the human soul is immediately created by God; he also stated that polygenism could not be freely accepted by Catholics because it was impossible to see how polygenistic evolutionism could be reconciled with the dogma of original sin, in particular the teaching that the original sin was committed by an individual Adam.52 In 1966 Pope Paul VI asked theologians to find a more modern 48 F.

The Commission could not see how some aspects of the first chapters of Genesis could not be literally historical, including the point made in the narrative, if not the narrative itself, that the first woman was formed from the first man, and also the necessity for a monogenistic origin of the human race as the basis for'its unity. 51 Secretary of the Pontifical Biblical Commission to Cardinal Suhard, 16 January 1948, 'De Quaestionibus Criticis Pentateuchi', in Enchiridion Symbolorum Definitionum et Declarationum de Rebus Fidei et Morum (ed.

Such reversals are not uncommon in Catholic Church life, and our detailed examination of this episode in the history of the Catholic reaction to evolution theory shows that it can be misleading to draw premature conclusions about the Catholic Church reaction to developments in the natural sciences. Until the dust of controversy clears a little we need to note the difference between the usually very cautious judgments of the official spokespersons in the Church and the varieties of opinion held in the community as a whole. This is not such a peculiarly Catholic story in the end, but rather an episode in modern history. Struggles over freedom of opinion within the Catholic Church community, though they usually have a distinctly Catholic flavour and can proceed according to a peculiarly Catholic dynamic, are often repeated with variations in other cultural contexts. The Catholic Church community, whether or no everyone within it and without it accepts the fact, is a part of the modern world. Pope Leo XIII tried to push it out into that world after the years of uncompromising rejection that had been the legacy of Pope Pius IX. He was frustrated by a small group of reactionaries who were allowed to arrogate too much power to themselves. 53 Paul VI, 'Allocutio IV', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (1966), 58, 651 ff. 54 John Paul II, 'Message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Evolution', Origins (1996), 26, 349-52. 55 John Paul II, op. cit.
