<plain_text><page sequence="1">28 CIRCA Perhaps you could begin by telling us what you think is wrong with most current computer aided design. J.F. Well, it's usually assumed that because I have this role that I will be enthusiastic about any application of CAD. In fact, the reverse is true. To start with I do not recognise any ex isting computer aided design system as a useful design aid ? and nor ap parently does any practising designer. There are excellent computer draughting systems for drawing something that you have already designed, there are excellent com puter modelling systems for modelling something that you have already drawn, there are excellent computer simulation systems for simulating what you have already modelled, excellent structural packages for calculating what you have already simulated and so on. But there is a singular lack of any software which fundamentally assists the design process. I would go further and suggest that there are a number of packages around which claim that they aid the design process when, they are in fact, obstructing it. I frequently visit Colleges of Art and Design where I am led to the 'CAD Centre' or 'CAD Lab.' or 'Electronic Media Workshop' and shown rows of dutiful students working at terminals. What are they doing and why are they doing it? The looks that you get when you innocently ask "What are the educational objectives?" are reminis cent of the fabulous Bateman car toons. The answers that one usually gets are of the kind that makes one wish one had taken up professional croquet rather than being an academic. If you push your luck and ask why they are using particular soft ware or hardware you are likely to get answers of the kind "because it is in dustry standard". It is a waste of time to even ask how fast the technology is changing, when will the students be in industry, are the objectives of us ing the system in industry the same as the educational objectives etc....

Isn }t the computer really just another tool? The key words are just and tool. Even the assertion that the computer can in certain circumstances be merely a tool is I believe contentious as the com puter is imbued somehow with the quality of authority. A psychological trait in the naive, usually reserved for human authority has been transferred in an anthropomorphic manner to the computer. But the just implies that it can be no more than a tool and this I believe also to be very dangerous. Tool is equally loaded because the word is taken to imply that it is under the control of the user and working for and in sympathy with the user. In fact there are tools which enable and ex1 tend the user, and tools which disable and restrict. And one can use the right tool badly. Indeed, it raises the ques tion as to whether there really are such things as 'neutral' tools. We don't regard intellectual methods as neutral, do we, yet they are tools. The point is that we shouldn't use a computer for a task another 'tool' can do just as well. We need to use them for what they alone can do. Computer aided design should not be mimicking or parodying the way designers and ar tists work at the moment ? as with digital paintboxes ? but should be ex tending, enabling and amplifying their creativity and problem solving ability. Perhaps the question should be ? Is it possible to design computer software to aid a process which is not itself understood and which will be chang ed by the use of the new software? And thus to the more general issue ? How do you design a tool for a func tion which the tool will change? Put like that, the question is becom ing very philosophical. If CAD techni ques are presently used and taught so uncritically, in what way can you en visage helping design, and the arts generally?</page><page sequence="3">30 In what I am about to say, I am using examples from design and architecture because that is what I do; but I'm fairly sure what I have to say has much wider application, in visual fine art, in music and elsewhere. The answer to the ques tion is a set of further questions. If CAD does not yet aid design, what might? And what might the nature of this aid be? And what is this process of design that it is supposed to be aiding? And the even more difficult question is, if we can't decide what the process of design is (and there is a singular lack of rigorous design theory) is it possible to have computer software to aid a process which is not itself understood? So far computers have only been able (fortunately) to mimic a small part of the activity of a designer and have been unable to repeat or respond to the whole process due mainly to this lack of real theory, or even a metaphor for design. The metaphor which computer graphics developers have tended to use is one of sketching, and the problem here is that there has to be a distinction made between being vague and being sket chy. The differences between being vague and being sketchy coupled with the difficulties of being imprecise with a computer which often seems to demand unreasonable precision, unreasonably early, have led to considerable difficulties with software design for the design profession. What a design simulation or modelling program needs is the ability to give feedback from a vague idea, and this may be quite different in nature from a sketchy idea. Designers may doodle or sketch in two or three-dimensions but one has to ask, first of all, if this is actually a meaningful activity at all. Is it a form of mental doodling? Or peripheral activity? Or just local echo to help concentrate the mind? Or is there any meaningful information in the sketches? Perhaps the level of mean ingful information in doodles is very low and in fact the designers are merely trying to concentrate their activity, a sort of thinking with their fingers, and so perhaps not a useful activity to try and imitate with a computer aided design program. A better metaphor for a designer might be a juggler, and what is needed is a conceptual modelling program which rather than mimicking the scruffy sketch, mimics the process of juggling with ideas at a very abstract con ceptual level and of course works in three-dimensions and in terms of space right from the start. If one drew a line in the design process between those activities which take place before the first line is drawn and those which take place after, I would like to argue that all significant design decisions are taken before the first line, at the conceptual and problem solving stage, and that ac tivities after the line constitute refinement and crystallisation of the idea. So far most developments in computer aided design and graphics have concen trated on the part after the line because the systems are produced by the com puter graphics industry and therefore lines and pictures are required! I would like to suggest that the most important part of computer graphics development is going to lie before the first line is drawn and it is in this area that the most exciting developments will take place over the next few years, and it is in this area that the real value of computer aids will prove themselves to the designer. We normally imagine design as beginning with drawing. The very word tells us so. Now are you suggesting that lines are too ... how shall we say ... detach ed from reality? Yes. The real work in design, especially design for manufacture, takes place when we consider such matters as assembly, machining etc. Perhaps we should be dealing with buildable models rather than abstractions? If we take the building construction industry and design in architecture, for example, most theory has been concerned with very abstract models of the design and building process or built form. The available computer modelling systems are modelling a peculiar kind of architectural abstraction, a sort of computer realisation of a balsawood model with all its commensurate problems of failing to differentiate between ground, wall structure, roof. It is very easy to make an architectural form look impressive in balsawood. (You can even tell by looking at most modern architecture what the material for making the model has been.) The converse should be true, that we model a process, real materials, structure, bricks etc., but most important the process of construction or assembly. The model of the structure should know about statics but the model of the founda tions should know about excavator bucket widths. The model should be capable of assembling the building from the ground up and detecting errors, obstruc tions and clashes. Similarly, a product design model would allow the object to be assembled conceptually with full regard for the machine and manual operation involved. In product design programs and architectural programs, what one should be modelling isn't two or three-dimensional form, but the 0* 270*1-^--V 90* 180* I would like to argue that all significant design decisions are taken before the first line is drawn</page><page sequence="4">31 The challenge is to ask the philosophical questions.

That is to say, we start to work much as the craftsman works, beginning with process, and being responsible for the quality of the design right through pro cess and assembly. As it is, most of what passes for designing is too easy .... Too easy? One of the effects of a computer is that it acts like an amplifier ? it amplifies intelligence but it also amplifies unintelligence. (As exemplified by arcade games.) In its best form it is a kind of turbo-charger for the brain; but this can be abused. I would like to suggest that the hypothetical computer aided design systems of the future will represent a very real challenge to the designer. This begs the next question which is: Would students emerging from current design courses really be able to cope with the responsibility of driving a machine with turbo-charged design capability? ? I suspect not. The corollary to this is that, in fact, CAD may make design a more challenging and difficult activity and if this is the case it may in turn attract a better quality of undergraduate, which in turn may increase the quality of design. This may appear paradoxical but what I am seriously suggesting is that design is too easy, and that what has gone wrong is that the more intellectually capable designers have expressed their boredom with peripheral intellectual flippancy such as Post-Modernist styl ing in architecture, a clear symptom of intellectual boredom and being under employed and under-challenged. In that sense, design is merely shifting the scenery around; manipulating elements you already have ... It's worth while remembering that a great deal of traditional and folk design is combinatorial ? using a menu or repertoire of forms and shapes. In the 18th century most Georgian terrace houses were built by speculative builders using a handbook which was a design guide written by an architect. Now there are some computer enthusiasts who think this is a great discovery; they study a style and produce it's 'shape-grammar'. Then you can take the elements and the syntax and invent new configurations ad infinitum. You can even design new houses by Frank Lloyd Wright by this method! They call it 'algorithmic aesthetics'. This is an example of taking a small field of work, grabbing it, and wrecking it by making grandiose claims for something that is essentially easy. The point is, that the use of computers in design suffers from, on the one hand, a surfeit of very uninteresting and spectacularly bad work, and on the other, preposterously high expectations. That's a very bad position to start from. The challenge, the real difficult work, is to decide at what point the computer is really useful. To ask the philosophical questions. What I am interested in is teaching computing without the computer! Defining just what tasks electronic aids can best undertake. For example, evolutionary pro grammes, which operate by removing bad options from the list of possible op tions, gradually refining solutions down to the best. This way you get rid of redundant information. There has been some remarkable work done in this way on the design of turbine blades... You let the trial and error work be car ried out by machine! The other area is what I call the 'electronic craftsman'. The small-scale designer-maker has yet to realise the power of programmes which model not the form of the product, but the process of manufacture and assembly. Can you enlarge on this. Its purpose would be to re-establish the craftsman's control over the process, but to do so in the conditions of industry. It is this alienation and separation of man and machine which is responsible for many of the problems in design and manufacture at the moment which would be overcome if the designer could in effect, work with those tools on the shop floor but in an electronically simulated form which avoids the problems of expensive tooling. In other words, the tooling up is done electronically, rather than by machining dies. This would re-establish a one-to-one relationship between the designer and his product which has been lost through the industrial process. To put that another way,</page><page sequence="5">32 \ the one-to-one relationship between a craftsman-designer and his product, \ where the form of the object was intimately related to the process and material, \ was lost with the industrial revolution, with the high cost of tooling and the \ fragmentation of process. This process could be reversed by the computer with \ its ability to model not the form but the process. The designer sitting at the \ console could be fully aware of all the implications of what he was doing in ^^ terms of the constraints upon the machining process, the constraints upon the \, assembly process, the constraints upon the behaviour and stressing of the final \^ object. There could be continual information coming back from the system ^v as to whether or not components could be fed down hoppers, whether if they ^^ were symmetrical then an orientation operation could be avoided and so forth. &gt;w Here again I am talking with certain areas of design in mind, but I see no reason ^S^ why these ideas could not be employed in materials and processes and ob- ^W^ jects of a 'traditional' kind. ^s^^ And is this applicable in an Irish situation.... To establish high quality modern design anywhere away from a major centre is very difficult indeed. At the recent Joseph Furniture competition in London there were thirty entries shortlisted. Twenty-eight came from London and one from Ulster. You can bet the same thirty names turned up together at the Milan furniture fair the next day. When I first came to Ulster I thought this was because of cultural provincialism; that the same conditions essentially existed everywhere away from the major centres. But it's not simple provincialism at all, because it is clear that in an insular culture, artists can do perfectly well. Certain kinds of creativity thrive in insular conditions; it probably puts limits on fine art activity but it doesn't prevent it. It is also quite possible to work in Ireland and run a thriving artistic career all round the globe (I'm thinking of Alistair MacLennan but of course there are others). In crafts, insular conditions can produce unmistakable qualities (though also significant constraints). But it seems to be disastrous for a design culture. This has lead to attempts to import a design culture ? such as the Kilkenny project. I can't imagine anything more irrele vant, culturally or industrially. A foreign style, based on obsolescent and ex pensive methods of production. Now ... if we couple that with the LEDU con cept of industrial development, for the sake of job-creation without creating the technological and design infrastructure to develop further; then you have a mandate for cultural irrelevancy and design obsolescence. And can we get out of this double bind? ^ I see the electronic craftsman as a very small ^^ window of opportunity. I</page></plain_text>
