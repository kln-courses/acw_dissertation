<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEAN-LUC GUICHET From the Animal of the Enlightenment to the Animal of Postmodernism The aim of this article is to compare the relationship of man to animal (or to animals, if we heed Derrida's warning about the distressing but continual slighting of the necessary plural) in the eighteenth century on the one hand, and in these early years of the twenty-first century on the other. My ultimate purpose is to get some sense of the present state of this relationship and its underlying dynamics in our so-called postmodern world. Earlier centuries had gradually created a deep rift between man and animal, a rift generally unknown - or at least never so deep - in the ancient world. In the eighteenth century, to the con- trary, just as in our own day, the man-animal relationship tended to close up to the point of more or less reconstructing - at least theo- retically - that lost continuity. This means that we may legitimately ask whether today's view of animals is simply a legacy of the Enlight- enment. The answer is that understanding the structure of the pre- vailing man-animal relationship ultimately means seeing it as the completion of the eighteenth-century view, at least as represented by some of that period's most outstanding thinkers; this rounding-out process, however, was in retreat or stagnant during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (up until the 1970s, roughly speaking). To assess such developments over the centuries, it behooves us - aside from the necessity, here as elsewhere, of eschewing the myth of a progress supposedly reaching perfect fulfillment in our era - to articu- late the more or less implicit criteria generally deployed, namely con- tinuity, community, and communication. To take Diderot, Condillac, and Rousseau as the chief thinkers on this issue in eighteenth-century France, it does seem that the En- lightenment in its critical campaign against the Christian religion and the earlier metaphysical - especially Cartesian - tradition, was YFS 127, "Animots": Postanimality in French Thought, ed. Senior, Clark, and Freccero, © 2015 by Yale University. 69</page><page sequence="2">70 Yale French Studies striving to reconstruct the continuity between man and animal that these movements had denied or at least vigorously downplayed. This critical enterprise was radical inasmuch as it undermined the very foundations of these tendencies: the notion of the soul - a divisive or hierachizing barrier - was demolished by Diderot; the idealist or in- tellectualist theory of knowledge, which restricted true knowledge to the human mind alone, was refuted by Condillac, who went further in this direction than Locke before him; lastly, the two assumptions hitherto grounding ethical theory, first original sin and secondly the pre-eminence of reason, both of which precepts allowed man alone to participate in the world of what is right and of values in general while deeming his animal dimension to be the source of his fall, were challenged by Rousseau when he made sensibility the ethical and an- thropological foundation-stone. Today, in view of the broad decline of the Christian religion's domination of society and of people's minds - along with, in the scientific realm, the impact of Darwinism, genet- ics, the neurological sciences, ethology, and especially primatology - it would seem that a decisive rapprochement of man and animal has once again been achieved, providing the trends set in motion by the Enlightenment with their final concluding point, on this as on other issues. Ethics in our present-day societies, moreover, is based more and more upon naturalistic and compassionate considerations, and no longer in any way upon religious or metaphysical ones: ours is by no means an intransigent morality of duty and austerity, of tran- scendence and detachment, but on the contrary a less rational, more emotional morality of closeness and attachment to oneself and oth- ers which thus tends to rejoin the Rousseauist approach. At the same time, the removal of guilt from sexuality has dissolved the theme, so long dominant, of an original sin that corrupts the purity of the divine in man and in creation; the connotation of bestiality ascribed to animals since the Middle Ages has thus been likewise removed. Lastly, the gradual extension of equal rights to slaves, to women, to racial minorities, to children and adolescents, and eventually to the handicapped, is now tending, by a sort of contagion, to be applied to nonhuman living beings. Let us now take a closer look at our three leading Enlightenment thinkers. Rousseau's main concern, in my view, seems to be the cre- ation of a new picture of man. According to him, man cannot be de- fined simply in terms of man himself, as a separate entity. Far from it, for man can be understood solely on the basis of a primary ani-</page><page sequence="3">JEAN-LUC GUICHET 71 mality that makes him first and foremost a being of nature - the be- ing, precisely, portrayed in the first part of Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality among Men (also known as the Second Discourse ). That said, humanity is truly constituted only by the achievement of that perfectibility which is unique to man, or in other words by the historical process that mars his initial natural- ness. Thus, apparently for the first time, humanity is apprehended as a degradation of animality - not with a pejorative intent, however, or out of skepticism or some religious purpose, but rather to present a positive account of the social and historical figure of man and of the capacities developed in conjunction with this figure. True, "the man who meditates is a depraved animal,"1 yet that man is, irreducibly, the one that we are, fated to reflect because he can no longer slough off the self -consciousness that he has acquired, and that is now con- substantial with him, so as to avoid the problems that this raises, with all their ethical and sociopolitical corollaries. This radical shift from one kind of self -understanding in man to another corresponds to the switch from an anthropology of difference to an anthropology of differentiation. The original animal dimension of our being emerges thereby as essential: the animal becomes a counterpart for the hu- man in a relationship that is not only one of difference but also one of composition. Despite the alterations in the human component, its primary animality survives as a point of reference, a form of com- pleteness, equilibrium, and autonomy that is irremediably lost but for which a replacement must now be found within the eminently relative existence that has become ours. Fundamental tendencies that reside within us and endure despite all the layers superimposed by centuries of socialization continue to express that primary animal nature, self-love and pity being the main instances. Far, then, from being identical to original sin, animality in man - the core of sensibil- ity - becomes, in Rousseau's view, a force for authenticity and regu- lation that serves, if one can maintain its integrity and vitality, as a guarantor of the relationship to oneself and to others. Condillac, for his part, restricts the scope of the question of knowl- edge from the outset. He is not concerned primarily with animals, for the simple reason that he is not concerned with man either - unlike Rousseau, who focused his thinking on the nexus of issues 1.

All the same, inasmuch as he started out from and kept coming back to Locke's problem of the origin of knowledge, Condillac ended up by reconstructing the path of the de- velopment of experience, which is also that of the development of the mind, a shared path nothing about which to begin with distinguishes man logically from animals. Theirs are two minds thrust into the empirical venture of the construction of the self by the self - a pro- cedure devoid of constraints or programming of any kind, whether in the form of innate ideas or of some sort of instinct - and gradu- ally mustering all the intellectual, communicational, and social tools needed to deal with the problems thrown up in the course of experi- ence. The important point is that Condillac, with a commitment to a radical and consistent approach that distinguished him from his mas- ter Locke, did not separate sensation and reflection but coupled them together from the start - an approach echoed by the Rousseau of the Second Discourse : "Every animal has ideas because it has senses."2 Thus, even if the animal's development comes to a stop, the route is one and the same for animal and man, and the two are kept apart initially by no compartmentalization. The channel for all beings is unique and diversifies only a posteriori, as a function, precisely, of the circumstances and bifurcations presented by experience, by dif- ferent needs, and lastly by the specifics of each's sensory apparatus. With respect to these last, it is touch that turns out to be decisive, for it permits the vital activation of the immanent reflexivity of the tangible, this by virtue of man's particular aptitude - given his hands with their mobile fingers, relatively independent of each other, and his bare skin - for touching and sensing touch. Since perfectibility in Condillac's view also characterizes the animal, the difference be- tween animal and man is thus a matter of mere circumstance and thus in effect contingent. Diderot, who aspires to a thoroughgoing materialism, sees animal- ity as the universal form of a being that is conceived as entirely cor- poreal in nature. In his view, every individual is an organized entity and varies solely as a function of that organization. The greater the organic complexity, the more complex a being becomes in terms of desires, needs, faculties, and relationships with others and with the world, and as things stand at the moment the human individual rep- resents the most highly realized exemplar of that complexity. But no 2.

Adopting a completely Lucretian position, Diderot portrays the human animal as the happy outcome of chance combinations of matter, thus making the notion of a soul, hitherto the metaphysical basis of the difference between humans and animals, quite redundant. Some qualifications are nevertheless in order. In the first place, collective attitudes in the eighteenth century were only partly af- fected here (as in many other spheres) by the kind of critical thinking engaged in by our three thinkers. Moreover, as potent as it might have been, the new conjoining of man and animal was very far from being complete. On the contrary, Enlightenment man may be said to have always so arranged things as to remain in top position and pre- serve a measure of dignity that animals could never claim. Buffon is a prime example here: his Natural History presents one monograph after another pointing up the thoroughly anthropomorphic qualities and shortcomings of one animal species or another, whereas his Dis- courses stress that man differs from animals in an irreducible, indeed metaphysical way. The fact is that during the Enlightenment the pos- tulation of continuity between the two kinds of beings had in essence two foundations only: a physiological one owing to the progress of anatomy and a philosophical one associated with the spread of the empiricist theory of knowledge and the speculations of materialism,- still lacking were the scientific advances mentioned earlier that came in the wake of Darwinism. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that man, no matter how strong the tendency of critical thought to con- jugate him with animals, should eventually retain a separate status. We have already seen how Rousseau never truly contested this privi- leged position of the human being: even if man viewed as thoroughly immersed in the pure state of nature - and let us not forget that for Rousseau that state was purely hypothetical - is apparently indistinct from other animals, he still, thanks to his metaphysical freedom and perfectibility, possesses a behavioral polyvalence unknown elsewhere in the world of living things. Furthermore, that perfectibility, once stirred by circumstances, will elevate the human subject by endow- ing him - despite all the deviations and corruption of social arrange- ments - with the possibility of exercising moral autonomy. Even on the plane of the commonality of man and animal, Rousseau finds a way to preserve their distinctiveness: in his eyes they share the</page><page sequence="6">74 Yale French Studies capacity for compassion, but only so long as it is understood that compassion takes two forms, the first being an immediate, particular, and strictly negative form, the exclusively animal form of the repul- sion felt by man-in-the-pure-state-of-nature in face of the injury or distress of another sentient living being, and the second being the truly human form, far more sophisticated and authentically moral, the compassion that Emile first experiences only at sixteen years of age - which confirms that it is far from being animal. As for Condillac, at the very moment when he finds himself most deeply committed to this continuity between man and animal, he feels the need to distance himself from it by reaffirming the distinc- tiveness of the two kinds of beings in a rush of spirituality apropos of which it is hard to say to what degree it is attributable to a simple concern to conform to prevailing opinion and to what degree it reflects a heartfelt conviction.3 In any event, the philosopher's reassertion of this distinction effectively smuggles back in the difference between man and animal which - while the two pursue the same course, that of experience - causes the animal to halt very soon and man to continue indefinitely. Condillac certainly holds - unlike Rousseau, and before Rousseau, Descartes and Buffon - that perfectibility is common to ani- mal and man, but only in man is it indefinite, so that the portion of infinity to be found here below belongs exclusively to human beings. Diderot is certainly much bolder, for he carries the commonality of the two kinds of beings onto the metaphysical plane and, following La Mettrie, asserts their complete material - and hence ontological - unity. Here too, however, man - though reduced to a combination of animal elements - is described not just as different but also as unique. Man alone, in fact, thanks to the size of his brain and his exceptional sensory equilibrium, achieves a rational power and an autonomy of judgment that distances him decisively from animal impulsiveness. Thus, however strong his links to the world of the senses may be, no matter how analogous his reason may be to animal instinct (for hu- 3. "We may conclude that, although the soul of the beast is as simple as that of man, and that in this respect there is no difference between the one and the other, the faculties that are our portion and the purpose to which God appoints us demonstrate that, were we able to penetrate the nature of these two substances, then we should see that they are infinitely different. Our soul is therefore not of the same nature as that of beasts." Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, Traité des animaux, ed. M.

This is the thesis of Diderot's Encyclope- dia article on "Natural Right": "If animals were on an approximate level with us, [. . .] if they were able to convey clearly their feelings and thoughts and know ours with the same clarity: in a word, if they were able to vote in a general assembly, it would be necessary to sum- mon them there, and the cause of natural rights would no longer be pleaded before humanity but before animality."6 The limits Enlightenment thinkers placed on the conjoining of man and animal might nevertheless be interpreted as even further confirmation of the continuity between their century and ours. On this reading we, for our part, have simply gone further - but thanks to them - than our eighteenth-century predecessors. Perched as it were on their shoulders, we would have dared to proceed farther down the path they opened up, being at once more liberated with respect to traditional anthropocentric moral and metaphysical norms and better informed by virtue of decisive scientific advances in the interim. Nonetheless, this notion of a postmodern culmination of the En- lightenment approach to animals can be contested by a set of counter- 4. "Man is also an animal species; his reason is nothing but a perfectible and perfected instinct." Denis Diderot, Réfutation d'Helvétius (1773), in Œuvres 1 (Philo- sophie), ed. L. Versini (Paris: Robert Laffont, 1994), 829. 5. "But it is not thus with man. There is such a harmony between his senses that none predominates sufficiently over the others to lay down the law to his under- standing; on the contrary, it is that understanding, or the organ of man's reason, that is the strongest. It is a judge who is neither corrupted by nor subjugated to any of the witnesses. It preserves its entire authority, and uses it to perfect itself. It combines all manner of ideas and sensations, because it feels nothing strongly." Ibid., 815. 6. Encyclopédie 1, ed. A. Pons (Paris: Flammarion, 1986), s.v. "Droit naturel."

"Natural Right."</page><page sequence="8">76 Yale French Studies arguments in the light of which our century may seem on the con- trary to have slid back relative to this putative progress. First of all, even if one assumes that the theory of evolution was the chief lever of the reversal that began at the end of the nineteenth century, it would be utterly naïve to maintain that it quite simply eliminated mankind's distinctiveness. The fact is that, while in phy- logenetic terms this theory unquestionably brought animal species and the human species closer together, it did so only at the cost of an extreme temporal distancing that tended to neutralize this effect and buffer it no less considerably by surreptitiously introducing hi- erarchy. In the eighteenth century, by contrast, the time interval, far from countering man-animal continuity, was either absent (as in the creationist conception) or so short that it allowed animal features to emerge on the surface of the human countenance through an inter- play of anamorphosis and analogy, which may be found in Diderot,7 among others, and that inspired physiognomy, fast developing at that time. During the Enlightenment animality thus actually spurred hu- manity forward (which also explains the violence of the defensive reactions in a still potent theological context). Secondly, even as the theoretical continuity between man and ani- mal has unquestionably been reinforced in our time, actual proxim- ity has declined and the density and variety of animal presence in the immediate space of our surroundings has evaporated (household pets being an exception that does not invalidate this general trend). A reversal within the man-animal relationship is thus apparent as be- tween the pre- and post-Enlightenment periods: during the Cartesian seventeenth century proximity predominated without continuity, whereas in our own neo-Darwinian times continuity prevails with- out proximity. As for the practical treatment of animals, it has never been more "dehumanized" and ethically indefensible than it is today, because man has replaced cruelty with a ghostly form of existence - especially under industrial farming conditions - that is so impoverished and paradoxically "de-animalized" as to be historically unprecedented. 7. Consider for example the famous reciprocal transformation of the dog and the Sorbonne professor (see Réfutation d'Helvétius, 823). In Darwin this immediate prox- imity between man and animal is discussed far more in his work on the expression of emotions than in that on the evolution of species (even though the two areas are obviously related).</page><page sequence="9">JEAN-LUC GUICHET 77 Furthermore, the differentiation between man and animal that once prevailed - even into the eighteenth century, as we have seen - did not stand in the way of a very strong investment of animals with meaning. Just the opposite, in fact, for animals in various avatars reflected human beings, their diversity, their obsessions, and their conflicts. Paradoxically, humans contrasted themselves to animals while at the same continually projecting themselves onto them, and deemed man and animal fundamentally distinct yet incessantly drew upon the inspirational force of the animal world. By contrast, today's embrace of inter-species continuity is accompanied by man's withdrawal of investment from animals inasmuch as, being merely a positive reflection of him, they no longer offer anything more than a redundant portrait. The animal mirror of man, far from displaying the traits of human personality in outline, as it once did, has now become completely smooth and self-satisfied, devoid of any real personality, as part of the same tendency which has rendered animals "nice" and stripped them of any true consistency and depth, making even wild animals less and less wild. This infantilizing, even de-animalizing sugar-coating of beasts leads eventually to a watered-down and uni- lateral vision of them while by extension doing much the same to images of the human downgraded into an anthropomorphically satu- rated world where the wild in the sense of the savage has been oddly expunged from nature. What seems to be disappearing as a result of these historical vi- cissitudes of the man-animal relationship is the animal's otherness; as though the most interesting aspect of animals were the degree to which they resemble us, whereas in the end the very opposite may well be the truth of the matter. Perhaps this explains the develop- ment, as a repercussion, of the vogue for exotic pets, for animals markedly different from us such as iguanas, chameleons, various snakes, or spiders, all clearly far harder to anthropomorphize. But even if these animals restore some measure of otherness to the rela- tionship, they remain strictly marginal and no doubt reflect a mere reaction within the overall human-animal landscape. So imperative, indeed, is our desire to have resemblance trump difference that our underestimation of the animal's otherness leads to the repression of our own human specificity, which we come to look upon as a shame- ful pretension. Here it is worth noting the moral implications of the constraint and even the contradiction embodied in an excessive iden- tification of man and animal, which may quite simply serve to stymie</page><page sequence="10">78 Yale French Studies any prospect of humans adopting an ethical attitude of respect and responsibility toward animals, this on the spurious grounds of the unlikelihood of an animal conceiving of, much less assuming such a biologically useless if not harmful attitude toward another animal, particularly one of a different species. Thus the claim of a continuity between man and animal has now been strengthened more than ever before while at the same time be- ing broadly deprived of its substance and benefits. To be more pre- cise, the fact of the phylogenetic continuity, because it is hencefor- ward fully established, has after a fashion anesthetized the issue of the difference and polarized efforts to identify resemblances or com- mon features systematically on other levels. What is at stake here for mankind has been pushed aside and all the emphasis placed on the cognitive faculties of animals and on the ethical corollaries of the re- valuing of their capacities. Reflection on the animal question might seem to have been waylaid, even alienated, by the question of animal cognition, triggering, curiously, a return to the perspective of late An- tiquity, preoccupied above all by the matter of animal intelligence and the ethical implications thereof (though the theological debates on metempsychosis should not be overlooked). And yet, and this is the point, it appears impossible to maintain that all discontinuity between man and animal has been eradicated, leaving a completely unbroken continuum. Far from it, in fact, for discontinuity has re-emerged, and this in a version so radical that it seems to invalidate the very possibility of any real continuity. The version of things to which I refer was first proposed by Heidegger. In light of it, we may proceed once more today to evoke change in our conception of the man-animal relationship and even to envisage the rupture of that relationship. The relevance of Heidegger's thinking on this subject resides in fact in the way he radicalizes the question by showing that it cannot be broken down by positing an animal dimension along with a specif- ically human dimension in man, as was done traditionally, or at least in the Aristotelian tradition. Even in their most glaring animality, hu- man beings always appear completely human,8 for man differs from 8. This is not to say that the human being can never in any way be described as inhuman: for one thing, the term "inhuman" denotes the opposite of the human not in a general sense but rather qua moral value; and for another, by extension, only humanity is capable of inhumanity, since all negation implies the pre-existence of the positive that it negates.</page><page sequence="11">JEAN-LUC GUICHET 79 animals not partially but coextensively: there can be no question here of components or levels that can be apprehended and isolated within the body of man's being and then compared with animal reality, be- cause the basis of the difference is an attitude toward the world and that attitude is a metaphysical one. To be exact, this human atti- tude or relationship - which defines the Dasein as such - consists in an openness to other beings and to the world as given in their own independent existence, and this distinguishes man from the animal, which is not open but trapped according to Heidegger within an en- vironment. Everything depends, therefore, on the way the question of this difference is envisaged, and approaching it in the right way - namely as a whole, without any break-down into elements (which would mean accepting different levels of identity and, step by step, anthropologizing the animal and annualizing man) - reveals the radi- cal nature of the distinction. The fact is that, even when we proceed in this way, whatever we recognize as animality in man remains ir- reducibly a human animality, which changes everything. What is so often referred to - questionably - as the animal side of man is thus never accessible as such to man himself but instead proves, invari- ably (as Condillac and Rousseau clearly understood with respect to the question of origins), to be always already understood and con- verted into man's humanity. Inversely, to be sure, one could take this to mean that humanity is never pure, nor purely separate, for it is al- ways more or less a conversion of animality - an idea, of course, that Heidegger would never have countenanced. It seems to me, therefore, that Heidegger reached a threshold on the animal question that made it impossible thereafter to frame the question in the terms previously used. It is in the wake of this step that Derrida's thoughts on animality were developed. His thinking is especially interesting in that it clearly embraces the human dis- continuity of the human postulated by Heidegger without, however, echoing Heidegger's underestimation of the animal's being. Derrida even calls the ignoring of this difference of man the second biggest "stupid mistake" relative to the animal question9 - a second error often overlooked but just as massive as the first that Derrida evokes 9. "I have thus never believed in some homogenous continuity between what calls itself man and what he calls the animal [....] That would be worse than sleep- walking, it would be simply too asinine [bête)." Jacques Derrida, L'animal que donc je suis (Paris: Galilée, 2006 [1 997]), 52. English translation by David Wills: "The Animal that therefore I am (More to Follow)/7 Critical Enquiry 28/2 (Winter 2002): 398.</page><page sequence="12">80 Yale French Studies elsewhere, and that consists, as already noted, in the homogenization of animality through the use of the singular "animal." In a way, then, Derrida goes at once further and not as far as Heidegger. On the one hand, unlike Heidegger who does not quit a meditative position, he commits his thinking to a quite experimental process, as he recounts in The Animal That Therefore I Am. Further- more, this experimentation, which is also a mise-en-scène, initiates a quite unprecedented way of envisaging the man-animal relationship neither as an opposition nor as a conjunction, but instead as a kind of exposure: naked in face of the frank gaze of a cat, stripped of all out- ward signs of the human, the subject is revealed in his own animality, thus reversing the traditional relationship of human dominance of the other (animal) by means of look, speech, and disposition/requisi- tion/manipulation. Submitting in a sense to this mute summons, the subject or "I" puts himself in question without any prior assump- tions and, letting himself be carried along by the motor force of the situation itself, experiences a veritable inverse cogito, one articulated by heteronomy and no longer reflected back to the self according to an unimpeachable formula of autonomy and sovereignty.10 The posi- tion of judge that Diderot, as we noted earlier, reserved for man as the subject of reason and jurisdiction is thus usurped by the animal, whose silence no longer stands for a lack or a weakness but rather for a strength, that of a hieratic attitude of oversight and mystery remi- niscent of the cats captured in the statuary of ancient Egypt. At this point it is in his entirety that the human subject, transfixed in his very being as it were by the gaze of the animal, henceforward unsure of that being and of the nature of the humanity of the human, is sum- moned to explain himself. On the other hand, Derrida seems elsewhere to lag behind Heideg- ger with respect not to the attitude and involvement of the subject but with respect to the determinants of animality itself. Contrary to the German philosopher, who describes animals as "world-poor," Derrida declines to characterize the actual being of the animal while treating its inner reality as a sort of undecidable vanishing point, cer- tainly a determining factor but quite indeterminate in itself. This en- 10. See Jean-Luc Guichet, "Ruses et distorsions animales du cogito: L' animal que donc je suis de Jacques Derrida," in L'animalité - six interprétations humaines, ed.

It is important to note that this metaphysical differentiation in no way justifies making the difference in question into a basic at- tribute of man. What is in play here, as we have seen, is a particular attitude and by no means a property of nature, human or otherwise. It so happens that this attitude, or relationship, is manifested at pres- ent by human beings, but we are entitled to assume - although Der- rida does not himself clarify this - that it is an essentially accidental phenomenon and in no way entails a priori that no other imaginable being could ever embrace it. On the contrary, since this specific atti- tude is an alteration of an earlier manner of being in the world which may be roughly described as animal, it is arguable that in any case it presupposes animality as its starting-point and may therefore - being by definition a corollary of a process of de-animalization - affect any animal, provided certain conditions are met (mastery of a symbolic language definitely being one of them). At the same time it seems to me that this exposure of the subject has a compensatory function, that it expresses a kind of remorse, and that in any case it is a secondary phenomenon with regard to the con- dition imposed overall on animals in the world of today, a condition more like incarceration than any kind of opening, more like a com- partmentalization than an intensification of the relationship.11 So has discontinuity won out after all? Throughout his account of this situation, which is at once com- pelled and exploratory, Derrida continually stresses the impossi- bility of communication with the animal whose gaze nevertheless penetrates to the human's very depths. But of course the power of that gaze resides precisely in its unreadability: does its determinative force derive from the animal itself, as source, or is the animal simply the catalyst of the human's own relationship of estrangement from himself, perhaps even of his own animal relationship to himself? The gaze that opens me up to this animal otherness sends me back merci- lessly at the same time to myself in terms of a solitude that is irreduc- ible because it is unreadable.

Moreover, in his book Derrida clearly denounces today's industrialized treat- ment of animals.</page><page sequence="14">82 Yale French Studies us here would seem to expose the present-day relationship of man to animals as one of non-communication, with the narcissistic relation- ship to oneself as its sole horizon.12 This metaphysical condition of solitude is thus also a historical condition. At least since the domestication of the dog in Paleolithic times, community between animal and man had never been broken. Even if, beginning with the Christian Middle Ages and up until the seventeenth century, the distinctiveness of man seems to have be- come more and more marked, this difference was always embedded in a human world populated - not to say overpopulated - by animals. Today, whereas the continuity between the two kinds of beings has, since the Enlightenment, been ever more firmly established or re- instated, the ancestral form of man-animal community has simul- taneously, and paradoxically, been eroded. In the first place, we are experiencing a crisis in our relationship to a nature from which we are gradually being excluded by the combined effects of our exponen- tial urbanization and our reduction of the overall animal population along with that of the diversity of species. Furthermore, in addition to the gradual decline of wild animals we must also consider the with- drawal of stock animals confined to spaces set apart in accordance with an overarching industrial logic. The old farm animals, which occupied a transitional place between wild animals and household pets - for while they were domestic in one sense they also kept a mea- sure of independence, while epitomizing the complete life cycle of animals until their eventual slaughter - have indeed vanished from the human landscape. The disappearance of animals splits the man- animal relationship in an almost schizophrenic way between, on the one hand, a superficially anthropomorphic vision exemplified by pets (as also by the media's idealized wild animals), and on the other, the objective but masked reality of the alienated animal of industrial- ized food production and science. And so, paradoxically, while the continuity between man and animal has never be so widely recog- nized in theory, it is countered by a de facto separation that condemns present-day mankind to a wilderness devoid of animal life (the grow- ing importance of household pets seeming to me, as already noted, to be a phenomenon that is more of a reaction to, than a negation 12. I do not have the space here to consider Deleuze's thinking on animals, and the same goes for many other present-day authors, but it seems to me that the thesis of becoming animal - in the sense of a change with no set goal or category, not even animality - does not imply any actual communication in the man-animal relationship.</page><page sequence="15">JEAN-LUC GUICHET 83 of this broad tendency). Now, it is arguable that animal company is the guarantor of an essential aspect of man's humanity. The result, once again paradoxical, is that de-animalization is correlated with a de-humanization of the world entailing a human solitude which may be described as animal in that it strips man of the open character that Giorgio Agamben, following Heidegger, considered a defining quality of the human. The confinement of animals and their disappearance from the space reserved to human beings compromises man's aspiration to open being by depriving him of contact with a true otherness that has the capacity - as a radically distinct external point of view that cannot be assumed by him - to serve as mediation in his relationship with the pure objective otherness of things and of nature. Whether animal- ity is reduced to a reflection of humanity or to the role of a replace- able cog in an industrial process, the animal is at once de-animalized and de-subjectivized. In consequence, too, human fife - henceforward a closed circuit - can no longer be constructed in its humanity on the basis of an animality that is a given and comprehensible as such; and this is even more true if, as it seems to me, that humanity consists in fact not in a set of personal and positive characteristics but essentially in a de-animalization, so that it is fundamentally the fruit of a nega- tive process. To this extent, by losing animals - and their diversity- man loses himself too, thus demonstrating the profound truth that identity consists primarily in being different from others, which also means being the same as them in some sense. These questions must by no means await our own times to be answered at last, for the eigh- teenth century - which could never have even imagined separating man and animal within the world they shared - furnishes the tools needed to investigate the lot of modern man, who is doomed to mull narcissistically over identity issues, unable to find the wherewithal in animality to nourish his humanity, as always in the past, in terms of imagination, of meaning, of thought, and, in short, of difference. - Translated by Donald Nicholson-Smith</page></plain_text>
