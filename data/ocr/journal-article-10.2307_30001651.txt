<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Irish Archaeology, VIII 1997 THE PATTERNS OF THE BROIGHTER TORC MICHAEL AVERY ABSTRACT The construction and decoration of the Broighter tore are reviewed (the two decorated half-tubes and the terminals). The patterns are analysed into constituent shapes, and their relationship with the decorated scabbards ftom Lisnacrogher is discussed, as is their relationship to the ambiguities of La Ttne 'shape-changing'. It is argued that the tort' was wholl'v manufactured in Ulster, and shows the extent to which Ulster craftsmen understood and exploited the (hanging techniques and decorative fashions of the contemporary Continent. The model of the society that could produce this item is discussed in theory, and it is suggested that the decorated La Ttne items from Ulster can be understood only' if they were created anId enjoyed by an aristocratic intelligentsia of craftsmen and patrons, confident in their Irishness yet fidly at ease in the intellectual mnilieu of their social equals in Europe. The implications are briefly discussed for the character of society in Ireland in the final few centuries BC. The decorated gold tore or collar found with other gold items at Broighter, near the foreshore of Lough Foyle, Co. Londonderry, about 100 years ago, is regularly illustrated as one of the glories of Irish La Tine art. My purpose here is to re-examine the form of the decorative patterns and their parallels, and to discuss*the issue of where and in what context the item was made. The item consists of two parts: the decorated tube and the terminals which serve to join together the ends of the tube. I shall first recapitulate the construction of the tube and its decoration and of the terminals, then discuss the parallels for the decorative patterns and their date. I shall then review the suggestion, still sometimes made, that the terminals were imports from outside Ireland, to which the decorated tube was added in Ulster; I shall conclude that this interpretation is wrong. Finally I shall outline a model of La Time society by which the ideas of the decoration and of construction are likely to have arrived in Ulster. PAST HISTORY The original report of the discovery was by Evans (1897). The location (near IGR C (24) 6425) has since been described by Warner (1982, 31-3): the circumstances of discovery have been discussed by Farrell and Penney (1975, 15-17), as has the metal composition of the finds. Descriptions of the main tore and its patterns have been published by Raftery (1983, no. 450, at pp. 167-8) and by Warner (1982). The main tore was found with six other items (Raftery 1983. 286: appendix, no. 21). The best known of these is the sheet gold boat (Farrell and Penney 1975), but there were also a sheet gold bowl and four torcs of gold: two were made of twisted gold bars; two were made of gold chain, with the ends of the chains inserted into terminal boxes of sheet gold. The tores (or necklaces) of gold chain both have most ingenious fastening devices at the terminals. recorded in fine detail by Raftery (1984, 72-73 and fig. 146, Left half -tube "Right half-tube II Fig. 1 Broighter torc (qfter Rafterv 1983, fig. 141), showing left half-tube (half-tube 1) and right hand half-tube (ha!f-tube ii). 73</page><page sequence="2">nos. 458 and 459). The main torc has often been illustrated, but it is necessary to chase through a number of publications to get a clear picture of its shape and decoration, which are best seen in colour photos. Following the excellent drawing of a side view given by Evans (1897, fig. 3), further drawings were published by Raftery (1983, no. 450: pp. 167-8 and figs. 141- 2). Though the latter shows sections that give a very clear idea of how the torc was constructed, they show the decorative patterns largely as a flat two-dimensional design, and cannot fully convey the three-dimensional aspect of the piece. Perhaps the best photographs to consult are the two very good colour examples published by Duval (1977), showing both a side view (pl. 207) and also a view from on top of the decoration (pl. 16). A number of other good photographs have been also published (Kruta &amp; Forman 1985, 50 (colour); Megaw &amp; Megaw 1989, fig. 346 (black and white); Raftery (ed.) 1990, 117 colour). Though Jacobsthal mentioned the tore only in passing (1944, 81, note 1), interest later quickened. Henry published a good photo (1954, pl. I). Jope noted the torc in passing (1959, 80) and later referred to it again (1971, 118). Warner (1976, 268) took it as "probably the earliest representative" of his EIA 2 or Irish 'Boss' style. Raftery published drawings and description (1983, no. 450) and discussion (1984, 186-192). In the 1970s and 1980s, the item was regularly illustrated in books on Celtic Art, for example, by the Megaws (1989, 184 and 210). DESCRIPTION The torc or collar is made of hammered sheet gold and has two main structural components: (I) a tube, highly decorated with relief and inscribed patterns; and (2) a pair of buffer terminals, mostly plain, but with a small amount of relief decoration and with recessed slots for added decorative strips. The tube (of roughly circular cross-section) is about 2.8 cm in diameter, and forms a circular torc about 13 cm in internal diameter. A projecting "key" in one buffer terminal fits into a slot in the other, to lock the terminals together. The tore might fit a medium-sized modem neck (40 cm or 16 inch collar), though the terminals would then press rather uncomfortably on the wind-pipe. Each of the main structural components was made of several pieces of sheet gold, joined together by firm hammering along the edges where they touched, to make a very close fit. The tube component probably always consisted of two separate half-tubes, joined at the back of the wearer's neck by a sleeve, and each of the half-tubes had high-relief spirals added as separate small gold fittings. Each half-tube is in practice made of seven pieces, the tube plus six added spirals. Similarly, each of the terminals is made up of several separately shaped sheets of gold (collars or discs), joined together by firm hammering. Along the joins between tube and terminals, the sheet gold edges fit a little less tightly and are hammered less close than elsewhere: each of these two joins is strengthened by a pair of gold pins passed through the entire structure. This reinforces the impression that terminals and tube were constructed as separate components, then fitted together. The pattern on one side (or half-tube) of the tore appears almost identical to that on the other. I shall use the term left half-tube (or half-tube I) for that side which has a recess and also a projecting key that fits into the slot in the opposing buffer; and the term right hand half-tube (or half- tube II) for that side which has the buffer that projects and has a slot in the end of its projection (Fig. 1). CONSTRUCTION OF THE TUBE The decorated tube now comprises two separate half-tubes, and was probably always of this design: the two half-tubes were evidently joined at the back of the wearer's neck by a sleeve (now lost), as on the tubular torcs from Frasnes-les- Buissenal and from Snettisham (Clarke 1954, pl. I and V; Furger-Gunti 1982). Each half-tube was made from one sheet of gold, joined into a tubular shape by hammering overlapping edges along the line of the inner circumference. In addition, each half-tube has six extra parts, since each of the high-relief decorative spirals was made as a separate small gold fitting, then attached in position on the tube by hammering. On each side (or half-tube), the decoration fills a parallel-sided rectangle, roughly one-half the perimeter of the half-tube. Both long sides of the decorated rectangle are edged by a slight ridge in relief. The decoration of one half- tube is almost identical in pattern to that of the other. In technique, the decoration is formed by hammering individual shapes (from the back) so that they stand up in relief. The relief patterns are raised to varying levels, and consist of high, ridged shapes (elongated and spiral) that have lower, slightly raised areas attached to them in places. All the relief decoration stands proud of a background which is scribed with compass-drawn arcs (Fig. 1). The high ridges may be short (in which case, they appear like laurel-leaf shapes) or elongated (when they are curved, and might in a modem mind evoke the shape of a banana). Where the high ridged shapes are combined with the lower, slightly raised areas, they together create shapes sometimes interpreted as 'trumpets'. This technique of raising patterns to varying heights and creating 'trumpet' shapes is also found on other items. It is recorded with particular clarity on one unprovenanced bronze disc of "Monasterevin" type (Raftery 1984, fig. 212, no. 792; Kruta and Forman 1984, plates on pp. 9 and 10). The shapes in relief either touch one another or else come very close, and the background of each half-tube is therefore split into some 24 separate areas, which (though infilled by scribed arcs) may be thought of as originally voids surrounding the relief shapes. In most of the voids, the background is filled by two sets of concentric scribed arcs, using two different centres, so that the effect is of a mesh of crossing, curved lines; it looks as if each area was scribed separately, each with its own set of compass centres. In two areas (the two trilaterals at the ends of the design), the area is treated as two separate triangles, and the arcs are based on three compass centres. In two further areas (the two large half-moon areas which border the 'snail-shell' spirals), the treatment is even more complex, with several compass centres. On each half-tube of the tore, the relief shapes include six spiral forms ('snail-shells') which are in very marked relief. Presumably, the relief was too sharp for them to be raised simply from the main sheet of the body of the torc, and they are in fact added pieces. In the main body of the torc, holes were created, by drifting through from the inner surface, in such a fashion that the sheet gold was turned to project outwards, forming an out-turned rim around the 74</page><page sequence="3">hole (Fig.8). Each hole (about 8 mm across) thus formed a kind of socket. These 'sockets' were then covered by small circular 'caps' or studs of sheet gold, which had been separately made into the form of the spirals, by raising. Behind the spiral shaped pattern, the sheet gold edge of each stud was shaped so that it could be pressed onto the projecting rim of the hole in the main body, where it clasped round the outside of that rim. Presumably the order of construction of each half- tube was that (1) the sheet was hammered out flat as one long rectangle, some 26 cm by 12; (2) the decoration (with its edging) was raised from the back of the sheet, in a strip about 6 cm wide down the centre of the sheet, with the 'sockets' for the 'caps'; (3) the 'caps' themselves were formed and decorated with raised spirals; (4) the compass-drawn arcs were inscribed in the voids of the flat sheet; (5) the sheet was curved round a former to create a tube, and the overlapping edges hammered tight on the inner face; (6) the decorated tube was bent into the shape of a torc; (7) the 'caps' were hammered into place on their 'sockets' on the decorated tube. As we shall see, the terminals also were each constructed by a complex sequence of stages. THE DECORATIVE PATTERN As it stands now, the pattern on each half-tube is on a curved surface, and analysis of its shapes and relationships depends on accurate assessment in three dimensions. In this, the design differs from the flat surface of a sword scabbard. If the proposed sequence of construction is correct, however, it is legitimate to analyse the patterns on the tube as a two- dimensional design, created on a flat sheet, as it stood after Half -tubeI Half-tubell Fig. 2. Half-tubes I and II of the Broighter torc together, for comparison. Fig. 3. Broighter torc: two views of half-tube I, one rotated through 180 degrees, to show that the design is almost symmetrical about a central point. stage 4, before stage 5. To help in this analysis, illustrations are presented here which show the design with the background arcs suppressed (Fig.2 to Fig.10): with areas in lower relief stippled, this highlights the higher, ridged shapes. These figures are based on the drawings published by Raftery (1984, fig. 141). The decorative patterns on the two half-tubes are nearly, though not quite identical. Fig.2 illustrates half-tube I as Fig.2a, half-tube II as Fig.2b. The differences appear to be no more than slight divergences in implementation, not differences in layout. The main differences are in fact in the scribed patterns that fill the voids which, though very similar in effect, are not identical in detail. The scribed patterns are, of course, merely background, not the main design. On each half-tube, the pattern is almost symmetrical about a point in the centre of the decorated strip, but not exactly so. Fig.3 shows two views of the design on half-tube I: Fig.3a has the torc terminal at the top; Fig.3b is Fig.3a rotated through 180 degrees, so that the torc terminal is at the bottom. As Fig.3 shows, there are slight differences in the proportions of the main curves, though these appear differences in implementation rather than significant differences in design. The main S-curve at the end nearer the terminal is rounder, the main S-curve at the other end more elongated. This difference in proportion is found on both half-tubes, and is therefore clearly deliberate, not just poor implementation of the layout. If the terminals are assumed to be at the front of the wearer's neck, the more elongated curves would be the rear curves, near the back of the neck. It is just possible that their greater elongation was a feature 75</page><page sequence="4">A~ 5 P1 Pla A2 P1 Al c d P2 A3 3 , Q44 (A4) (b) (c R3 B3 Q4 R2 R21 B1 B2 R1 B5 6R (a) (b) (C) Fig. 4. Half-tube II with the compoinenlts of the patterns labelled. deliberately intended to counter-act the foreshortened appearance which the rear curves would have when seen from in front of the wearer, by someone standing to one side or the other. The difference in proportion is perhaps too slight, however, for this explanation to be wholly satisfactory. It may be simply that the aim was two create two S-curves, and that is how the patterns were laid out. but implementation was free-hand and therefore inexact. At both ends of both half-tubes, a pair of motifs project from the curve of the main S-curve, like a pair of "ears". Fig.3 shows how these "ears" differ slightly one from the other. At the end near the torc terminal, the two joining halves of the main S-curve lie below the projecting ears, which appear as separate appendages: at the other end, the two halves of the main S-curve run as lines into the 'ears' themselves, and end there. Although the background arcs are clearly inscribed as compass arcs, there seems no evidence that the raised patterns were laid out by compass. Even if layout of the main curves was guided by compass (for which there seems no conclusive evidence), the raising was done free-hand. The basic layout of the pattern is fairly straightforward. though when one looks closer the designs become more complex and ambiguous. I shall discuss the designs using half-tube II as a model. To assist in the discussion, I have labelled various components of the pattern on Fig. 4, as well as showing them in less cluttered fashion on Figs.5, 7, 9 and 10. The pattern is analysed on Fig.5 at a simple level, into five components (A. B, P. Q and R). each with several parts or sub-components. Components A and B each consist of an S-shape. with the lower arc of the S cut short (component A being the S-shape nearer the terminal). Components A and B are both made up of three main parts, each consisting of an elongated curved strip which is thin in the middle and thickens out at each end to finish in a 'trumpet' shape. Inside the areas defined by these curves are components P, Q and R: P and R are near-identical components, one rotated 180 degrees from the other; Q is a central component, itself symmetrical about the central point of the half-tube. P, Q and R are each built round two 'snail- shell' spirals which have 'laurel-leaf and 'trumpet'-shaped extensions. Each of the six 'snail-shell' spirals is shaped from an added sheet of gold (as described above). When we sub-divide the main components in more detail. parts of the pattern clearly consist of the same motif repeated several times, at different alignments and in different positions. As the first example, the two S-shaped components A and B are shown on Figs.4a and 5a, A being at the top, nearer the tore terminal, with the more rounded shape (see Fig.3). B being at the other end, with the more elongated shape. Here the repeated motif is a 'trumpet' curve. Component A divides into several parts: the main S-shape consists of three parts, Al, A2 and A3 (each a 'trumpet' curve), numbered from the top end of the S-shape: the extra 'trumpet' curve which would be required to complete a full S-shape (A4) is missing; the two 'ears' at the top may be numbered A5 (at the right, attached to A 1) and A6 (at the left, attached to A2). Component B may be analysed in the same fashion into six parts, most of them 'trumpets' (part B4 again a ghostly absence). Second, the components P and R are likewise made up partly from a repeated motif, in this case a spiral with a more pointed end attached. On Fig.5b are shown the full components P and R, each component having a pair of the 76</page><page sequence="5">Pi P2 R2 Rb (a) (b) (c) Fig. 5. AnalYsis of the layout of half -tube II, divided into its components projecting, high-relief spirals that were made separately and added in these positions as 'caps' over 'sockets'. Fig.5c then shows P and R each reduced (by suppressing 'trumpet' shapes around them) to a pair of high-relief spirals (PI and P2, RI and R2) and the pattern that immediately surrounds those spirals. In each case. the surrounding pattern is raised, consisting partly of high ridges and partly of lower, slightly raised areas (the latter being stippled on Fig.5). The basic structure is shown by the pair P1 and P2 (RI and R2 being like P1 and P2, but rotated through 180 degrees). P1 appears almost identical to P2 in conception, though they differ slightly in execution. Each comprises (a) a spiral core from which extends (b) one elongated, narrow 'leaf' shape, ending in a point; and this point is connected back to the curve of the spiral by (c), a short 'laurel-leaf', pointed at both ends; the triangular area (d) enclosed by (a), (b) and (c) is in low relief (stippled on Figs.5b and 5c). The axis of PI is aligned at right angles to the axis of P2. P1 differs from P2 in two respect. First, P1 is larger than P2. Second, P2 is simpler than PI, in that P2a winds out in a clockwise direction from the centre, and extends directly into the elongated 'leaf' P2b, whereas the spiral Pla uncurls in an anti-clockwise direction from the centre, then joins the elongated leaf P lb, which reverses direction and uncurls clockwise. The pair Q and Q2 are different. Again, Fig.5c shows each reduced (by suppressing 'trumpet' shapes around them) to a pair of high-relief spirals and the pattern that immediately surrounds those spirals. Ql and Q2 then each consist of a central spiral (a). which unwinds clockwise and extends to a form of short trumpet end (b). From the opposite side of (a) also springs a second trumpet shape (c), in fairly high relief, which is joined and complemented by a low 'trumpet' (d), stippled on Fig.5c. The only real difference between QI and Q2 is that Q1 is larger than Q2. As Fig. 5c shows, QI might be interpreted as some sort of animal or bird morph, with eye (a), projecting chin or beak (b), forehead (c) and the back of a head (d). Third, the four "ears" (A5 and A6, B5 and B6) are each the same repeated motif, though with a complex relationship between them (Fig.6). Seen in detail, from the same alignment, each motif is not unlike a "face", and may be analysed speculatively as having a "forehead", two "eyes", and a "mouth" or elongated "nose". On Fig.6 upper, this is the appearance of A6 and B6: on Fig. 6 lower (the same as Fig.6 upper but rotated through 180 degrees), it is A5 and B5 which resemble "faces". A5 and A6 have "mouths" rather than "noses", but B5 and B6 have long "noses" (or perhaps "beaks"). Taken together, B5 and B6 have their "foreheads" close together, and have long "noses"; in contrast, A5 and A6 might be seen as having their "'mouths" or "noses" close together. At a more complex level, cutting across the simple analysis into five main components shown on Fig.5. other relationships were apparently present in the mind of the designer. Some of these are shown on Fig.7. They show the ambiguities which exist in the patterns. Fig. 7 uses parts which are suppressed from the analysis on Fig.5 (P3, R3 and Q3 to Q6), and suppresses some parts shown on that figure. Figs.7b and 7c show in the centre different analyses of component Q. On Fig.7c, the two spiral motifs QI and Q2 of Fig.5c are suppressed, to show simply the trumpetoid curves (Q3 and Q4) that surround Q1 and Q2. Fig.7b also shows Q3 and Q4, but with the two added 'banana' shapes, Q5 and Q6. 77</page><page sequence="6">B5 A6 B B6 A5 A A5 B6. B A6 "EW -sa B5 A Fig. 6. The 'ears'of tew Broighter tore (haUlfrube II) At this level of sophistication, there are also alternative ways of re-assembling the parts of components A, B, P and R. Fig. 7c shows that P1 and P3 may be combined into a pattern of a spiral at one end, with a hanging trumpet shape. Fig.7b echoes that pattern of spiral and hanging trumpet, by combining P2 with Al and A5. How far such echoes were consciously intended by the designer is not clear. of course. The echoes and ambiguities are, however, certainly as real in the complexities of the completed design as are any human, animal or bird images. The same analysis applies also to components R and B, in the lower part of Fig.7b and c: RI plus R3 is a version of P1 plus P3, rotated by 180 degrees (Fig.7c): R2 plus BI and B5 is similarly a rotated version of P2 plus Al and A5 (Fig.7b). THE TERMINALS The terminals are each made from a number of sheets of gold, folded or bent to shape and then fixed together by careful hammering. The main pieces are shown on Fig.8 (based on Raftery 1983. figs. 141-142), a schematic diagram in which I have enhanced the original to exaggerate the gaps between individual strips of sheet and display the construction (at least in so far as it appears to me). On both sides of the torc (half-tube I and half-tube II). the main decorated half-tube is part A and all the other parts are constituents of the terminals. Parts A to F are the same on each half-tube: parts G to N differ, reflecting the differences in shape between the two terminals. A1 P1 P2 P3 Q3+5 Q3 Q4+6 Q4 R2 R3 B1 R1 B5 (a) (b) (C) Fig. 7.

Onto B is attached the expansion of the terminal, consisting of a disc or washer-shaped sheet C. a short tube D (with a recess for added decoration E) and a second disc or washer F On half-tube I. part F looks as if it may close the entire end (having the projecting key N added in its centre), with a thin sheet disc M in its recessed part. Into D is shaped a recess or groove to take the decorative band E (missing from half-tube II) and gold sheet backing E2. E is the strip of embossed sheet which forms a decorative insert here (described by Raftery (1983. 168) as "fused to sides of groove" and by Jope as "a refined, sprung-in beaded strap" (1975, 24). Behind the embossed sheet is a recess lined by manufacture. A similar construction was evidently adopted to connect the two half-tubes at the back. Here the half-tubes must have been joined by a separate sleeve, and small holes for pins or rivets are visible close to the ends of the half- tubes: as Fig.1 shows, each half-tube appears to have been pierced by two pins (though the pins are missing and some of the holes have been lost or obscured by damage). The pins at the back of the tore were placed in very much the same positions as those attaching the terminals at the front: on each half-tube, one pin passed through close to the border between the decorated zone and the zone where the gold sheet was left plain on the inner face of the tube; the other pin passed 40 A D Half-tubell j A2 B- Half-tube I A20 - M '- *-A3 A3K A EB H lF.

On half-tube II, the projecting part is built from the tube G (with groove inside which is the U-section gold sheet strip H), strengthening ring J and the final disc K (with a slot in its centre to take the key N of half-tube I). The junction between parts A and B is marked or hidden by a row of embossed dots on part A, on both half- tube I and half-tube II. As a result of this embossing, the sheet edges of parts A and B do not fit together all that closely and have not been hammered together into a tight fit. The junction is also marked by the presence of two long, thin gold pins (labelled A2 and A3 on Fig.8). These go through from one exterior of part A, right through part B, to the opposite exterior of A; the pins have hammered rivet heads on both ends. The pins go through at 90 degrees to the plane in which the tore would lie flat on a surface. Presumably they were intended as rivets, designed to strengthen the join between the two main structural components, tube and terminals. As I have pointed out above, this was probably the final join of the through the decorated zone, but at a spot where the decoration consisted of inscribed compass circles, not raised relief decoration, and the surface of the gold tube was a simple curve. Similarly, the pins at the back would have been aligned like those attaching the terminals at the front, at 90 degrees to the plane in which the tore would lie flat on a surface. I do not fully understand how the mechanical forces of such pins or rivets would have operated, but they would make more sense if they passed through a wooden core, analogous to the iron core reported inside the similar tore from Frasnes-les-Buissenal (Clarke 1954, 43; Jacobsthal 1944, no. 70, pl. 51 b). There is no mention of such a core in the original report by Evans (1897), but if it was of wood it could have rotted away. Similarly, if the construction of the terminals is as I have analysed it, then some of the junctions between pieces of sheet would certainly seem easier to effect if there were a wooden core inside the gold sheet (especially the addition of C to B on both sides, and the addition of G to 79</page><page sequence="8">(a) (b) (c) i ( I: Fig. 9.

DISCUSSION Two aspects of the tore require discussion: first, the decoration (both its patterns and the technique of its making); and second, the question of how much of the tore was made in Ulster (which depends on the view we take of the terminals). Finally. I shall discuss the economic and social model which should underlie the study of such items (covering questions of workshop traditions and movement of ideas). I shall conclude with an outline of the reasons for believing in the importance to the study of La Tdne decoration of the concept of a La Tne intelligentsia. DECORATION Parallels for the decoration on the Broighter tore divide into (a) parallels for the patterns and (b) parallels for the techniques used. Patterns The obvious comparison for the Broighter patterns, often mentioned in general terms in the literature, is with the shapes engraved on scabbards from Co. Antrim, especially two scabbards from Lisnacrogher (Raftery 1983. nos. 260 and 261/2), which is only some 50 to 60 km from Broighter. The technique used is very different from that employed for the scabbards, but the patterns show considerable similarities in form, based on two features. First, the patterns on Broighter and on the scabbards are composed of two opposed C-shapes. one rotated through 180 degrees from the other. On the scabbards, the design is subtly different from that on the tore, in that the two C-shapes on the scabbards join to form a true S-shape, whereas on the torc components A and B are separated and form in effect two partial S-shapes. Second, that the subsidiary patterns which hang from the tips of the main curves on the tore (components P and R) are pendent curves similar to the subsidiary patterns which hang from the tips of the C-curves on scabbards. The parts and components discussed and labelled above are combined together in various ways on Figs.9a, 9b and 9c and Fig.10. for comparison with the two relevant scabbards, shown on Fig. 11. I have concentrated on the components A, P and Q, fitting together as one partial S- shape; components B, R and Q would fit together as a similar S-shape. rotated through 180 degrees. Fig.9 takes one half of the pattern on half-tube II. Fig.9a combines together parts Al. A2 and A3, with all parts of P (P1. P2 and P3), plus parts Q2, Q4 and Q6. Fig.9b combines together parts Al, A2 and A3 with parts P2 and P3 and with parts Q2, Q4 and Q6. Fig.9c combines together parts A1, A2 and A3 with parts P1 and P3 and with parts Q3 and Q4. Fig. 10 shows two S-shapes, combining together parts AI, A2 and A3 with part P3, plus parts B1, B2 and B3 with part R3; then adds, between the two resultant S-shapes, the parts Q3 and Q4. Each of these four patterns resembles the S-curves on the scabbards Lisnacrogher I and 2 (Fig. 11), though none is identical. Given that the component A of the Broighter torc consists of only three curves (AI to A3), and is missing the 80</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 10. Broighter torc half-tube 1, showing the patters as one single S that has disintegrated. fourth potential curve A4 that would complete the full S- curve, the obvious comparison is with parts of the curves on the scabbards, the upper (top right) components. Fig.10, however, shows that the whole design of the Broighter tore (half-tube I) might be seen as based on a single S-curve that has disintegrated at the centre into a set of disassembled small S-curves. Fig.9c shows how the curved pattern added to the tip of component A (made up from P1 and P3) parallels the S-shape added at the top of Lisnacrogher scabbard 2, while the S-shape formed at the bottom of component B (made up from Q3 and Q4) is a different form of S-shape. Alternatively, one can see from Fig.9a how the shape of the whole of component P is a different curved addition at the tip of component A, and the shape added at the bottom of Fig.9a (composed of Q2, Q4 and Q6) is to some extent an echo of it. Fig.9b offers a third approach, with the small curved motif hanging from the top of the S-shape (P2 and P3 hanging from Al) closely echoed in shape by the lower motif, attached to the bottom of the main S-shape (Q2, Q4 and Q6 hung from A3). This approach makes the upper part (Al, P2 and P3) into an S-shape more like those of the sword scabbards, in that it has a near-identical motif or minor element hung from both ends of the main S-curve. The genesis of the Broighter patterns must therefore have lain in a milieu such as produced the Antrim scabbards, in which S-shape patterns were very familiar. There are nonetheless clear differences between Broighter and the scabbards. None of the patterns suggested for Broighter is identical to any individual pattern on any known scabbard. On Broighter, the single S-shape characteristic of the scabbards has been broken up into two partial S-shapes (Fig.9a). The Broighter design does show a pendent curve attached at the tip of the main S-shape. a characteristic also of scabbard decoration: the pendent curve of Fig.9a has two spirals inside it, as does the pendent curve on Lisnacrogher scabbard I. In general, however, the pendent curves on Broighter are not identical to those on the scabbards, nor are they located in quite the same place. A second influence on the designer of Broighter was probably the Plastic Style decorated ring-headed pins (of Raftery's type 2), such as the two unprovenanced examples in the Ulster Museum (Raftery 1983. nos. 411 and 412). These both exploit S-shapes like those on the scabbards: in the case of no. 412, the pattern tapers to fit the available surface, as do the patterns on the Antrim scabbards where the pattern enters the narrowing tip by the chape (Raftery 1983, fig. 111). They also, however, exploit knobs that protrude from the pattern, attached to the ends of the Ss and fixed onto the lines of the Ss themselves. The knobs are protrusions in the Continental fashion (Jacobsthal 1944. nos. 267-279). rather than tight spirals such as occur at Broighter, but they do form protrusions from the surface of a curving cylindrical shape. They give a background in decorative design for the S shapes and knob-like spiral protrusions that form the main characteristics at Broighter. The designs of the Broighter decoration might be best interpreted as resulting from a new approach to the S- shapes by a new mind of a new designer, familiar with the layout and patterns on the scabbards and pins, but wishing to develop new ideas based on those patterns. This, however, would lie well within the tradition of the decorative patterns on the scabbards, since these include a variety of S-shapes. developed and embellished in differing ways by individual designers: for example, the Toome scabbard (Raftery 1983, no. 268) has full single S-shapes. but embellished with ... - I (a) (b) Fig. 11. (a) Lisnacrogher 2 scabbard (after Rafterv 1/983, fig. 107, no. 261/2); (b) Lisnacrogher I scabbard (after Rafterv 1983, fig. 107, no. 260). 81</page><page sequence="10">pendent curves of a rather more rococo appearance than Lisnacrogher scabbards I and 2; in contrast, the scabbard from the R. Bann in Co. Derry (Raftery 1983, no. 270) has partial S-shapes, formed by areas in reserve surrounded by engraving. In detail, the design on the Broighter torc also employs considerable ambiguity, as shown by the alternative interpretations on Figs.9 and 10. The interpretation on Fig.9a shows one of two figures (the second being the same but rotated through 180 degrees). It is this possible theromorph which Warner interpreted as one of two "sea horses" or "hippocamps" (1975, 33-6). His interpretation is a tribute, perhaps, to the ambiguities built into the design, but I do not think he can be right (see Appendix A), any more than would the suggestion that the extra curves seen on Fig.7b (but left off Fig. 7c) represent bananas imported with the Barbary ape found at Navan fort (Waterman 1997, 120-125). Such overlapping alternatives are the sort of thing which underlie Jacobsthal's "Cheshire Style" (1944, 19). It has been more usual to note alternatives where one is an abstract figure and the other some sort of naturalistic representation. Commonly, the natural creature has been anthropomorphic, a human face., as Jacobsthal originally noted: a considerable number were assembled by Lenerz de Wilde (1982) and Szab6 (1992, 141-143) has suggested further examples (some more convincing than others). Sometimes, the natural creature has been a non-human theromorph, usually an ornithomorph such as the duck (or is it merely a three-legged junction'?) on the Torrs chamfrein (Fox 1958, pl. 19c). It has been usual to interpret these ambiguities as 'shape-changing'. with patronising overtones of mystery, magic or religion (Megaw &amp; Megaw 1989, 20-2; Szab6 1992, 143; Laing &amp; Laing 1993, 110-114). This appears to arise from the belief that such patterns must have meaning: even theoretical analyses of the formal character and layout of art independent of meaning (Korn 1978, 166-172) tend to end up concluding that the patterns revealed "can only come to life" when their meaning can be identified (ibid., 172). On the Broighter torc, however, it appears that these ambiguities are also a feature of purely formal patterns, which may be seen as several purely abstract forms, having nothing whatever to do with naturalistic representation. Such ambiguities do require some sophistication to create and to enjoy, but there seems no reason to see anything of mysterious or magically religious significance in such pieces of purely intellectual fun. Technique The relief decoration of Broighter, using 'trumpet' designs, is a different technique from the scabbard decoration. For this reason, discussion has generally focused on material later than the sword scabbards (Raftery 1984. 187-90; Warner 1976; 1983, 161-5). The change in technique is paralleled also by differences in the aesthetic character of the decorative patterns. The way in which parts of the raised decoration come close to one another (or even touch) leaves voids between the raised decoration which are close to the patterns of the first century BC (such as the Snettisham tore or the Lough Crew bone slips), in that they produce closed three- sided polygons, with each side curved (either concave or convex). These trilaterals, as I will term them to distinguish them from simple triangles (with their modem overtones of straight sides), are a regular feature of the patterns of insular final Iron Age La Tene decoration, because of the way in which items of this stage have designs that are pushed close together (reaching their inelegant nadir perhaps in the cramped, over-crowded patterns on the Snettisham terminals). One might speculate that the development of the changed styles arose from two kinds of change, occurring apparently in parallel, a change in taste and a change in technique. The change in taste led to placing designs closer together, creating closed trilateral-shaped voids between the designed patterns; which in turn led to use of these trilateral shapes as pattern rather than merely as void between pattern. The change in technique, to the use of gold sheet, provided the opportunity to make a great show at a lower cost: the tubular tore gives the illusion of a solid gold tore, but uses much less raw material. Use of gold sheet facilitates the making of items that have a major visual impact (a) because the sheet can be used to make larger and imposing items that use relatively little of the expensive raw material because they are hollow; (b) because gold is malleable and easier to hammer as thin sheet into complex, sophisticated patterns, since it does not work- harden, crack and split and therefore need difficult annealing; and (c) because the surface of high quality gold does not oxidise and therefore 'seals' into a firm joint when two sheets are hammered firmly together, which allows complex constructions to made up from separate simpler parts, instead of having to be cast (which requires more gold, because casting must be solid). To use gold sheet for raised decoration increases the illusion of solidity and therefore the visual impact. One might speculate that this was part of the intention in exploiting the malleability of gold to create raised decoration. The idea that sheet gold could be used for its impact was present before 100 BC in Ireland, as is shown by the hollow, decorated terminals and hollow, but plain half-tubes of the gold tore from Clonmacnoise, Co. Offaly (Raftery 1983, no. 451), now believed to come from a bog in Knock Td, Co. Roscommon (Ireland 1992, 141-2 and map at fig. 1). Beating gold out thin to make a great show had of course been exploited also with gold lunulae, way back in the Early Bronze Age. The development about 100 BC is to exploit the idea to make larger, decorated tubes. Even so, it is clear that the shaping of the complex, high relief spirals was beyond the limit of the technical ability of whoever made the Broighter torc. It proved necessary to make these separately and to insert them. Construction As is shown by the diagram with cross-sections (Fig.8), the technique of applying the spiral 'snail-shell' X is identical to that of building the terminal: shaped gold sheet is formed with a flange which slips precisely over the rim of a hole formed in the tube A. In the case of the spiral X, as on the other junctions, the key to success was the very careful shaping of the two edges which were to be joined by hammering. Indeed the small size of X. and its importance as part of the decorative pattern, would have made exact precision at least as crucial here as on the pieces ol the terminals, where the greater radii of the joins (and the fact that most of them are slightly hidden from public view by the 82</page><page sequence="11">swelling shape of the expanded terminals) might make exact precision less crucial and allow some adjustment for differing radii of strips being hammered together. DATE The date of the Broighter tore is, in general terms, well established. The parallels with other tubular tores of sheet gold. sometimes decorated in relief and with somewhat expanded terminals, seem compelling. These other torcs were listed and briefly described by Furger-Gunti (1982, 21-28), and comparison with the Broighter tore was fully explored by Raftery (1984, 185-190). The torcs are several times found with coins which, although not always precisely datable, appear to belong to somewhere between just before 100 BC and 50 BC (St. Louis, Basel: Frasnes-les-Buissenal; Snettisham). A date somewhere in the middle of the first century BC would place the Broighter tore, very plausibly, after Antrim sword scabbards from which its patterns seem to have developed and before such fine-line relief decoration as that found on the Bann disc. The only difficulty might be that the Broighter tore shows very markedly the technique of raising parts of the pattern to varying heights, to create 'trumpet' shapes, which is also found on bronze discs of "Monasterevin" type (Raftery 1984, fig. 212, no. 792; Kruta and Forman 1984, plates on pp. 9 and 10). These discs are conventionally dated to around 100-200 AD (Raftery 1990, p. 124). Current evidence for their date is far from precise (Raftery 1984, 280-282 and 272- 275), and they could certainly have started by the middle of the first century AD (MacGregor 1976, 103-4). A suitable compromise, if one is necessary, would be to date the Broighter tore a little later in the first century BC, and start the discs (and other items with related ornament) in the early first century AD. IRISH OR IMPORT? For some years, the generally accepted view was that the Broighter tore was made in two parts in two places: the terminals were made outside Ireland, probably somewhere on the Continent of Europe, then imported; the tube was added or decorated in Ireland. More recently, this view has been criticised, and opinion has tended towards treating the whole item as "of native manufacture". The import view was started by Jope (1959, 80), who noted the item as "the Broighter collar, of which the T- junction ends seem continental, with a new tubular collar put on in the British Isles"; and Jope later repeated himself (1971, 118), describing it as a "composite piece" with "junction elements of continental manner and a new tubular collar ... added ... as the product of an Irish workshop". Jope (1975) says "the Broighter collar as we know it seems to be a composite piece" and notes the terminals as "foreign pieces". Warner initially followed Jope in holding that the Broighter Collar was "almost certainly an Irish remodelling of a continental or south British original" (1976, 26), but later changed his mind and opposed the idea that the tube had been added to imported terminals (1982, 30). He noted that raised decoration on the terminals was "quite acceptable as Irish boss-style", and preferred to connect the Broighter terminals more closely with one of the two gold chains apparently imported from area of the Mediterranean, the one (Raftery 1983, no. 459) which shows granulation that Warner felt "provided the model for the granulation on the &lt;Broighter&gt; collar buffer". Raftery rightly opposed Jope's view (1984, 186-7, 190, 192), noting the similarities of the terminals (and indeed of the tore in general) to Continental examples listed by Furger Gunti (1982), but also noting differences of the terminals (Raftery 1984, 186-7). Like Warner, he felt that the granulation on the gold chain could well have been the model for the granulation (or, as he noted, the pseudo-granulation) on the Broighter terminals. He concluded that "there can be little doubt that the tore from Broighter is a product of Irish workmanship" (Raftery 1984, 190). Despite this clear evidence, doubts have persisted. Megaw &amp; Megaw (1989, 184 and 210) followed Jope, noting the collar as "a possible Continental import locally decorated in Ireland", and have continued to maintain the Continental character of the terminals (1994). Even Raftery became more hesitant, noting that the torc was "of likely native construction" (1994, 128). The evidence reviewed above establishes clearly that the Broighter torc (despite its two-part construction) was all of one conception. The crucial aspect, not apparently emphasised before, is that the technique of constructing the terminals (out of separately designed sheets, later hammered together) is found also on the decorated half-tubes. On the terminals, most of the separate sheets serve as the structure of the terminals, but several (parts E and H above, on Fig.8) are decorative inserts, separately designed and added into prepared locations. Similarly, on each of the two half-tubes, the six relief spirals are decorative inserts, separately designed and added as 'caps' to prepared 'sockets' on the half-tubes. Whoever created the decorated half-tubes had the same delicate gold-working skills as whoever created the terminals. Indeed, it is arguable that the design and insertion of the spiral 'caps' is a more complex three-dimensional achievement than anything seen on the terminals, exacting and fussy as indeed their construction is. Similarly again, the riveted attachment of terminals to half-tubes at the front is exactly paralleled by the riveted attachment of half-tubes to a sleeve at the back. If the whole manufacture and assemblage of the torc can be seen to follow one (highly skilled and delicate) set of methods, the idea that the terminals were imports is much weakened. As we have seen, the technique of embossed or raised decoration, so well executed on the Broighter torc, emerges from the opportunity offered by a renewed recognition about 100 BC of the potential of gold sheet for making items that have a major visual impact. The manufacturer of the Broighter tore clearly understood and applied these sheet working techniques. Indeed, the trilateral or 'trumpetoid' designs of its pattern are perhaps the most elegant exploitation of the technique of raising in relief which is found on any of the torcs. Certainly the curls and swirls of the resultant pattern retain more than any other tore the ethos and aesthetic character of the traditional La Tine style that originated in the Waldalgesheim period. This skilled and sophisticated adaptation of old style to new technique shows that the creator of the Broighter half- tubes was not in any sense inferior in the skills required nor derivative in design, concept and execution. This would agree with the evidence that sheet technique was also used in the terminals to create pseudo-granulation of the decorative inserts, of course saving gold by the technique. It is possible, 83</page><page sequence="12">but not, I think, really essential to see the mimicking of granulation as copying the granulation on the necklace of gold chain found at Broighter (Raftery 1983, no. 459). The alternative is to suppose that the technique of granulation was familiar to all who moved in the milieu which created the other hollow sheet tube torcs, since granulation is found on them (Frasnes and Mailly). The use of the hollow sheet techniques and raised decoration shows clearly that the creator of the Broighter torc was fully familiar with that milieu, and there seems no reason why the ideas of granulation should not have come from that milieu. The creator of the Broighter tore just took the idea of saving metal by using sheet one step further than did his contemporaries. If the Broighter torc is all of one build, there must be some explanation of its two-part construction, with the two terminals clearly added onto the two decorated half-tubes and fixed by gold pins. The simple and obvious explanation (and, I would have thought, the correct one) is that both the half- tubes and the terminals were constructed using wooden cores to provide a backing for the hammer blows that sealed gold sheets together along joining edges. Since the relief patterns must have been raised by hammering them from the reverse, any wooden cores must have been employed after this, to provide the main structure that supported the shape of tube and terminals. It might be possible to do this with one single wooden core, extending through terminal and half-tube, but a more sensible way would be to make separate cores for terminal and for half-tube, then join them together. Such a construction in several pieces would certainly fit with the way in which the gold sheet was broken down into smaller components that were then built up into the whole. An obvious way to fit terminal to half-tube would be to cut a mortise into the wooden core of the terminal (or of the half- tube), into which would project a tenon on the end of the other wooden core. This looks like the sort of design reflected in iron on the Frasnes torc (Clarke 1954, 42-43). The gold pins would then be inserted through mortise and tenon, to hold together the two pieces of wooden core, which would be left in place to strengthen the torc. SOCIAL MODEL Underlying the differing interpretations of where the parts of the Broighter collar were made is, I suspect, a disagreement about theory. in particular about the interpretation of the "influences", "similarities", "connections" and "relationships" which form the stock-in-trade of those who discuss and compare decorated La Tene objects. Partly because the under-pinning theories are rarely articulated, these inexplicit theories strongly determine much of the interpretation. Workshop tradition The underlying theoretical structure appears to divide into two parts. First is the theory that decorated items are made in workshops, and that these workshops have each their characteristic workshop tradition. Second is the theory that an item which exhibits characteristics of a particular workshop was made in that workshop. To take the first part first. It is obvious that such items were made in a physical workshop building, but we have little evidence of how arrangements were organised: the best evidence to date appears to be that from Gussage All Saints (Wainwright 1979; Foster 1980; Spratling 1979). But this is not all that the workshop concept implies. It implies that the products of one "workshop tradition" share certain features which are not shared by products of other workshops. If it is true that workshops for the manufacture of La Tene decorated objects were widespread (Spratling 1979, 141-144), a single workshop tradition must include, at least in principle, a range of locations. These locations are connected together by being geographically close enough for the same persons to be regularly present and working there and, more importantly, by the features which they share. Exactly what these features are is, of course, the main uncertainty. Clearly, within La Tene decoration there did exist regional customs or traditions or styles (whatever term one wishes to use). The close similarities which link the scabbards from Co. Antrim are sufficient to establish that Ulster was such a region. There is, however, a well-known tendency for patterns and motifs of La Thne decoration to echo one another very markedly across what modern writers have felt to be surprising distances (Schwappach 1971, esp. Abb. 18, opposed lyres, and Abb. 19, Waldalgesheim-Stil: Frey 1976, 152 and fig. 13; Megaw and Megaw 1990, 82-89; Megaw 1982, 222-224), making it difficult to identify tightly defined workshops or regional communities without very careful analysis. The only analytical study known to me of a regional tradition in La Tene decoration is that by de Navarro (1972, noting the maps at pp. 66 and 311) of the Dragon-Pair and the Swiss Scabbard Style patterns; in contrast, the definition of the "Hungarian Scabbard Styles" is achieved simply by listing those which are ascribed to a particular style (Szabo and Petres 1992, 37-59 and catalogue), with no detailed attempt to explain why. A "workshop tradition" classes together items which share certain features in common, but the definitions are rather like the traditional definition of a culture by Gordon Childe (1956, 8-10, 111-2): a culture is "a recurrent assemblage of associated types". What are the types'? how regular is recurrent? in what way are they associated together'? In the case of a "workshop tradition", are the shared features the material used? or the tools used? or the techniques used? or the layout of the design? or patterns used in the design? or techniques of infilling the pattern'? or which mixture of all of these'? On items which have a functional character, one might argue that a "workshop tradition" was best sought by examining similarities in non-functional, decorative features. With items whose main purpose is to be decorative, not practically functional, there is real difficulty in deciding what features to concentrate on. This ill-defined concept of workshop traditions seems to be what underlies the comparisons between items found in one place and those found in another area. If an item from, say, Ulster shows a feature (of whatever sort) which is also found on an item from another area, it is taken to reflect the work of another area. The item is then taken to be an import, as the only way in which quality of decoration or craftsmanship can have reached Ulster. Given how very few items of La Tdne decoration we have from Ulster, even though it is the area in Ireland where La Tdne decoration is much the best represented, this argument is vulnerable to the reply that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. To underpin the argument is then introduced the concept of workshop tradition: the "foreign" feature lies outside the 84</page><page sequence="13">workshop tradition in Ulster and inside the workshop tradition of the other area. Inevitably. some items must have been transported into and out of Ulster in antiquity. The concept should, however. be treated with scepticism in individual cases. Before accepting that it happened, we need quite rigorous definition of the workshop traditions concerned. Movement of ideas The second part of the theory addresses the question of how any such foreign features travel from one area to another, They must be carried by human beings. but in what way? There are perhaps two possibilities. The standard interpretation seems to be that the features were carried on a completed physical item. clasped as it were in the sticky paw of a traveller or trader. The alternative is that the features were carried in what we may perhaps term a 'template', as a picture or pattern in the mind of a person who travelled. The sticky paw theory tends to assume that there is a set of static craftsmen who are supplied with items (to copy, one supposes, or at least to emulate) by travellers who are (presumably) their clients or customers, and their social superiors. The most notable example related to our present context is perhaps the theory of Warner (1983, 167) that the Torrs pony cap and 'homs' started their life in Scotland, were transported to Ireland for decoration there, then returned to Scotland for final deposition. Usually such discussion is phrased in terms of trade. though sometimes the idea is that the items which are held to travel are part of a nexus of gift exchange between kings and great nobles: Megaw quite rightly raised the issues of distributions and their meaning (1982, 216-7). and has emphasised how difficult it is to see any precise correlations between distribution of decorative traits and the standard patterns of cultural zones derived from other artifacts (1985. 179-182). As we have seen, it is not clear that either ethnic distributions or trading distributions (in so far as we can guess at either) really explain the wide distributions of parallels in traits and patterns which have been identified in La T'ne decoration. The kinds of social and political contacts which probably could explain such otherwise unpredictable patterns might be developed by an intelligentsia of the kind discussed below, if they were wealthy, of well-connected leading families, and able to travel widely. Such people, sometimes involved in a nexus of gift-exchange. could also transport ideas of pattern, design and technique widely amongst their social milieu. Jope, the Megaws and Warner seem to belong to the 'sticky paw' tendency, but the 'template' theory seems to me more plausible. The most likely place for such information to be carried is, I suspect. in the memory of a connoisseur, as a mental template, but one could not entirely rule out the possibility of a physical drawing. The precise layout of design of some of the items with compass arcs, and the existence of trial pieces of bone from Lough Crew (Raftery 1983, nos. 621-780, figs. 187-200) both suggest that the La Thne craftsmen tfound it as useful to carry a physical representation of a design as would we. In the absence of decisive evidence of physical drawing, I would settle for a mental template. The argument for the 'template' theory depends on the character of La Thne decorated objects in general, and more particularly on the Ulster items which are our immediate concern here. It is that the patterns are visible only to a person who handles and examines the item with great care, usually under oblique light. They are not visible to, or intelligible by, an onlooker at a distance; the item must be taken up and handled for the pattern to be visible. Even more, the person who examines it must have a knowledge of the expected pattern, and an expertise in what to look for, if he is to see the similarities between different items. We tend nowadays to be spoilt in our understanding, by excellent photographs and drawings which make the patterns plain to all. This would not have been the case in antiquity, when photographic spotlights did not exist. The small scale of La Ttne decoration was well described by Duval (1982, 3) Cet art est plus difficile que beaucoup d'autres A 6tudier et ia faire connaitre par des publications, parce qu'il est composd en majorit6 d'objects de dimensions moyennes ou faibles, parfois meme exiguds (les fibules, les monnaies). Or, il faut voir un object orn6 et le tenir en main, si I'on veut pouvoir exposer toute sa superficie au regard et le comprendre afin de l'expliquer". In antiquity also, there would have been the same necessity to handle the object personally and carefully if one were to examine, admire and understand its patterns. The decoration must therefore have been aimed at an in-group, an intellectual elite who both had sufficient access to the items for them to be able to examine them and also had the expertise for them to know the stylistic conventions and understand what the maker was trying to do with them. It is possible that this in-group comprised merely those who made such items, but it seems to me more likely that those who paid for the objects (by whatever mechanism) were sufficiently knowledgeable to appreciate the designs, indeed to have deliberately commissioned them with anticipation. This must imply a cultured class, the audience for the decoration. This in turn implies people with a knowledge of the canons of taste and pattern such that they must surely have carried in their head memories of patterns which they had seen. A La TZ'ne intelligentsia This alternative model, of a specifically intellectual elite, has been perhaps too little explored by archaeologists. There has been a tendency to lump all those with wealth or status together as 'high-status' or 'elite', without discriminating different functions and personalities amongst them. As regards the La Thne period, clear evidence of a high-status intellectual was published by de Navarro (1955; 1972, 257- 8), when he drew attention to what he termed a "doctor's grave" of LT2 date from Obermenzing, Bavaria. The grave- goods consisted of a sword and scabbard, spearhead and shield-boss, and of several iron items which de Navarro very plausibly interpreted as tools for the surgical operation of trepanning. He drew attention to the Mediterranean background of such surgery, and suggested that the burial was of a man of some status in La Tine society (ibid., 233- 4). De Navarro did not take further the issue of the social and intellectual status of the individual. He was apparently a man who practised an intellectual craft or skill, but whose social status was symbolised on death by the La Tine accoutrements of a gentleman, the sword, shield and spear. The implications have perhaps been obscured by the very unusual nature of the skill: a foreign skill learnt in the 85</page><page sequence="14">Mediterranean, especially the skill of surgery which we still treat as of a high status, has tended to be contrasted with the skills which one might find in craftsmen and intellectuals who operated wholly within the economy of La Tene society. Megaw has listed a number of examples of La Tene I burials with tools included (1985, 173-174), where a few of the graves do appear to be of high status. In the Iron Age of England, the best evidence to date for some sort of intelligentsia appears to be that from Gussage All Saints, where it appears likely that items like horse equipment (some of it decorated) were regularly manufactured in a number of locations (Spratling 1979, 141- 144), implying that there were a considerable number of craftsmen who had a feeling for decorative style. By implication, the styles and techniques of such an intellectual elite would have a wide currency. This would be a model of an intelligentsia which included both craftsmen and also their patrons. The patrons are likely to have been socially superior, but not necessarily of a different social class: one might consider the parallel in the Early Historic period of Uraicecht Becc, where the aire desa (lowest grade of noble landowner) is rated at 7 seoit, and the umaide (master craftsman in bronze) at 8 seoit, much the same valuation of status (MacNeill 1924, 274 $11 and 39). In this model, craftsmen would be mobile enough to have wide ranging movements and contacts and knowledge of contemporary styles and techniques, and an accurate picture of them, whether a mental template or a physical drawing. Ethnographic parallels suggest that the social status of craftsmen may vary very greatly (Rowlands 1972; Megaws 1990, 82). One might perhaps adapt the concept of metal- workers as "part-time specialists" (see, for example, Rowlands 1972, 212-3) and extend it to suggest that the individuals responsible for the scabbards and Broighter may have been nobles who gave instructions in a craft workshop only as a part-time activity. SOCIETY IN IRELAND It therefore appears that the Broighter torc was made, terminals and decoration, by a connoisseur and craftsman fully familiar with traditional Ulster styles and patterns of La Tene decoration, and also fully in command of the techniques of sheet goldwork, and familiar with the use of such techniques to create the large, decorated tubular torcs that occur occasionally but widely over W. Europe, and which were apparently developed in the decades around and after 100 BC. There seems no reason to suppose that the milieu in which he worked, though physically situated at the very edge of Europe, was in anyway derivative or intellectually inferior to that of his contemporaries across Europe. As a social context for this, I have suggested that he belonged to an intelligentsia, familiar by travel and observation with contemporary techniques and designs on the Continent of Europe, not simply in adjacent Britain. Such an interpretation has implications for our understanding of Irish society in the final few centuries BC. Clearly such a person functioned in a milieu where some had the enormous wealth and leisure required for them to indulge in such entertainment and enjoyment. They must presumably have been a tiny minority at the top of society, since the archaeological evidence suggests that at this time Ireland in general had a backward and under-developed economy, having few of the technological developments which had by this time brought increased efficiency on the Continent and in Southern England to the manufacturing. food-producing and distribution sectors of the economy: little if any pottery; few manufactured objects of iron with which to till the fields, make household equipment and furniture; no coins. An economy that functions without such facilities inevitably requires that the inefficient labour of many be exploited to support any few who live in prosperity. Some background is given by the evidence from Navan fort. Co. Armagh. Here. very early in the first century BC (specifically. just before 90 BC) was built the great ceremonial monument of the forty-metre multi-ring timber circle that was later burnt and covered with a ceremonial mound (Lynn 1997. 159-171; 1997a, 224-230). Whatever the exact symbolism of this structure and the related activities, it reveals the existence of political or administrative leaders capable of organising such a major ceremony. Leaders with a similar authority carried out such activities further south also, at Knockaulin (Lynn 1991; 1992) and Rathgall (Cooney &amp; Grogan 1991, 37-39; 1994, 187-193). These people must have been familiar with those who enjoyed the decoration symbolised by the Broighter torc, indeed part of the same society. There may be some uncertainty about the date of the decorated trumpet from Lough-na-shade (Raftery 1984, 136 ff.; 1987, 24), and it could be later than the early first century BC, but such pieces must certainly have been known in the best circles in early first century Ulster. This society had emerged from a background of at least a century or so during which their aristocrats and intelligentsia had maintained contacts with Continental Europe. The start of these contacts is symbolised by the torc from Clonmacnoise (or Knock), perhaps an import, but during the later third or second century BC they continue to be shown by the ring-headed pins of Raftery's type 2, with decoration based on Jacobsthal's Plastic style (Raftery 1983, nos. 407-413; 1984, 157-175) and by the decorated scabbards of Co. Antrim. Interpretation of this social phenomenon of the last few centuries BC in Ireland has been muted. The reason is not far to seek. Interpretation has long been dominated by an obsession with discussing whether the society represented the arrival in Ireland of persons speaking Irish, or of a Celtic ethnic group (Raftery 1984, 324-5; Waddell 1991, 5-9). Archaeologists have ranged from overt acceptance of invasion (Herity &amp; Eogan 1977, 224) to more veiled phrasing of 'intrusion' (Warner 1991, 45-46). Even where 'Celtic' and 'intrusive' interpretations have been rejected, there has still been a continuing focus on the origins of the society in Ireland (Raftery 1984, 333-4; 1991, 29; 1994, 225-6) to the exclusion of most other interpretation. Raftery has provided all the information to show very clearly that Irish La Thne objects in general represent a fusion between Irish ideas (often contributing the physical shape of the object) and ideas (often of decoration) that were abroad in the wider community of Europe (1983; 1984). He has rightly emphasised that this created items which are unmistakably and distinctively Irish in conception and execution (1984, esp. 324; 1994, 225). Arguably part of the technique lay in constructions based on compass circles, such as are found particularly in the Rhineland and Eastern France (Lenerz-de Wilde 1977: map of locations at Karte 1, p. 36; examples on Taf. 1-68). Such circle-based constructions 86</page><page sequence="15">probably lie behind La Tene patterns in Armorica, SW England and also the rest of the British Isles (ibid.. 85-86), where the patterns developed often as Cs and Ss. The characteristics which I have ascribed above to the creator of the Broighter torc are characteristics also of the makers of many of the earlier items: they were made in Ireland by individuals who had a firm grasp of the techniques required by their materials. a clear visual sense and crisp execution. The range of items found in Ireland is smaller than that in Europe: no decorated LTI fibulae, items of Jacobsthal's Plastic style limited to ring-headed pins, with none of the bracelets and LT2 fibulae, and none of the sheet metal helmets and armour. What there is. however, is carried out with a confidence and maturity that is in no sense derivative and which produces. at its best, items that stand comparison with the best of their kind in Europe. The impression given indeed is not that these were intruders, but that they were from the beginning settled, secure and confident in their Irishness. aware constantly of what went on among their social equals in Europe (though perhaps much less sensitive to the situation of their inferiors than were their Continental and British contemporaries). They were entertained and delighted by the fascinating development of decorative patterns and design that went confidently forward in aristocratic circles in Europe in the fourth and third centuries BC. and wealthy and leisured enough to play and experiment with these raw ideas until they implemented them with a distinctively Irish flavour. Rather than see the ideas which they developed as imposed by intrusions, we should see them as the fruits of a continuously outgoing search by a leisured Irish aristocracy for novelties which they might adapt and implement for their own delectation. We might see the Barbary ape found at Navan as a charming curio brought home from the Grand Tour by a cultured aristocrat. together no doubt with a trainer and keeper for the precious pet. The Broighter tore is the continuation of this process, showing that even into the first century BC an intelligentsia in Ireland were reaching out to understand and develop for their own pleasure the changing ideas of fashion and taste among their social equals in Europe. Notes I No. 268 from Toome also has S-shapes. but is less similar to Broighter. 2 Even if one might have some reservations about exaggerating the importance of the work by Hodder in Kenya to which he refers (Hodder 1977). since some distributions described by Hodder seem to follow patterns which are not tribal and therefore may have an economic basis. 3 It appears to me as evidence of an assured and confident political authority. rather than as evidence of competition. instability. stress and upheaval, as was suggested by Robertson (1992, 28). 4 Even Cooney and Grogan. in their Social Perspective on Irish prehistory, contented themselves with discussing the function of ceremonial centres such as Navan (1994. 187-1930 and emphasising continuity from the Bronze Age, especially in the deposition of artifacts ( 1994. 195-9). 5 With the exception perhaps of the tore from Clonmacnoise (or Knock), which does have Continental features not paralleled in Ireland. Though it is worth noting that the whole picture of this torc would be totally changed by discovery in Ireland of just one single extra piece of the same sort. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am grateful to Petra Rose for discussion of the Broighter torc, and to my wife Hilary for many useful comments on a draft of this paper. Appendix A Warner's interpretation Warner suggested that the patterns on the main tore be disassembled into a view of two shapes which he termed "sea horses" or "hippocamps" (1975, 33-6). His interpretation seems to require one both to suppress some parts of that design (near his small sea horse) and also to distort others (to create the "mane" of his larger sea horse). This appears a high price to pay in order to import into the torc an iconography of which there is otherwise little good warrant in La Thne decoration. On Continental La Tene coins, the sea horse which Warner sees on some (Allen 1980, nos. 547-9) is an animal with head and body (but no rear legs visible) beneath the legs of a larger horse. The designs engraved on most La Tene coin-dies are derived from one of the staters of Philip II of Macedon (359-336 BC), either in the form of a head on the obverse and a mounted warrior on the reverse (ibid., no. 13) or in the form of a head on the obverse and a biga on the reverse (ibid., no. 163). Both forms lead to La Thne coins which have a horse on the reverse with various kinds of schematic or partially represented feature in the cramped space beneath the body and legs of the horse. The biga design was occasionally reproduced with reasonable exactness (ibid. no. 526, from N. Gaul) but more frequently resulted in the many examples of disintegrated design, with a loose chariot wheel running away beneath the horse, as illustrated by Allen (1980, nos. 199, 216, 223, 225, 227-8, 241, 246-8, 250, 309, 322-3, 390-1, 462, 467, 490, 523) and by de la Tour (1892, pl. XXXIV, nos. 8569, 8533, 8585; pl. XXXVI, nos. 8901, 8932; pl. XLII, no. Evans 1.10). The mounted warrior on Philip's coins is connected with the mounted warrior spearing a human enemy which appears on some tetradrachms of Patraos (Allen 1982, no. 16), and these occasionally produced La Tene coins with human bodies (ibid., nos. 214- 5, 222) or human heads (ibid., nos. 491, 543, 555) between the horse's legs. It is more frequent, however, to find the rider on horse interpreted by La Tihne die engravers as an image of hunting, with a boar between the horse's legs, as shown by Allen (1980, nos. 220, 233, 476, 529-30) and by de la Tour (1892, pl. XLI, no. Evans 1.1; pl. XIX, nos. 6331, 6342; pl. XXII, nos. 6541, 6654, 6676; pl. XXV, nos. 6955, 6978, 6980; pl. XXVI, nos. J.20-21, J.40-41, J.48). Though there are a few cases with a foal between the horse's legs, either lying down (Allen 1980, no. 542) or sucking (ibid., no. 519), a couple of the very examples cited by Warner seem in shape more like hunting dogs (ibid., 548, 549), as indeed do other examples (Allen 1982, no. 189; de la Tour 1892, pl. XXVIII, nos. 7017, 7018 (or a hare?), 7169-71). For the animals with gaping jaws and no hind legs which are found on La Tine items as, for example, the "dragon pairs" on Swiss scabbards (Jacobsthal 1944, pl. 70; de Navarro 1972, 216-238), the most plausible indigenous origin inside Europe is not the hippocamp but undoubtedly the wolf, represented in just this fashion as early as the Bass- Yutz flagons, decorated in the Early Style of Jacobsthal 87</page><page sequence="16">(1944, no. 381). The Megaws felt that the animals on the handles and rims of the Basse-Yutz flagons looked "more like dogs than wolves" (1990, 58) and found a few examples of dogs on what may be Early La Thne items (ibid., 59). In La Tine decoration in general, the ambiguity between pure pattern or shape and the representation of the real world tends to occur with mask-like human heads, in the form of visual punning which was termed the "Cheshire" style by Jacobsthal (1944, 19). It occurs in the British Isles: good examples are fairly rare, as has been noted by Megaw (1970, 275-6); more speculative examples do occur (Lenerz de Wilde 1982. 104-6). La Tine coins, with their much greater emphasis on representation of the real world, coupled with their tiny size and cramped proportions, lend themselves to a very different style of ambiguity. The parallel Irish emphasis on bird heads and ambiguity (for which see Raftery 1984, 220-3) should probably be seen as a continuation of the general European Bronze Age tradition of representing bird heads.
