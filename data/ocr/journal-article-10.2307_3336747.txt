<plain_text><page sequence="1">Functions of Sculpture in Dogon Religion WALTER E.A. VAN BEEK God, creator, head of this place, who changes a bowl of leaves into food, who changes a bowl of millet into leaves, God, creator, who changes everything, The day has passed, God, the shadow of the evening fell. God of my daughter, the evening has come, the barrenness of our child thickens. Diminish her spoken words, give her a healthy belly, let her bear children.... W e are in the middle of a sacrifice. Mejugo, the officiant, wearing a white cloth around his loins, leads the proceedings. His daughter, Yasaa,1 sits at the side, responding to the cues Mejugo gives her in the ritual invoca- tions with an appropriate "eeee" or "mmmm." The sacrifice is being carried out on her behalf because she is still not pregnant after several years of marriage. Not only does she really want children, but her marriage will be in jeopardy without them: she will even have trouble leaving her parental home for her hus- band's.2 Today's sacrifice is by no means the first related to this problem. One in- dication of its persistence is the presence of a statue showing a woman kneeling with a child (e.g., Fig. 1). Mejugo has placed it next to the altar, an earthen cone that is kept under or beside the bed inside the house. He has taken two altars (omono or ama in Dogon3) out into the compound, one for himself and one for his daughter, dusted them, and pre- pared them for the ritual by smearing them with fresh mud and circling them with a special twig covered with chewed charcoal. An old, well-worn leather string with a bead, the duge, is placed over the altars, and finally the statue is set next to them. Then the sacrifice be- gins in earnest. Mejugo intones a long invocation to all gods and beings from the Dogon pantheon. This is the toro, the basic text for many Dogon rituals, two stanzas of which have been given above. As he does so, he pours water and rice gruel on the beads, on the altars, and on the statue. The text is recited throughout to the end of the proceedings. No ritual can be carried out without "words" (Calame-Griaule 1965:416), just as no sacrifice can be performed without some kind of altar. In the toro, which is too long to be cited here (Paulme 1940:444-46; Dieterlen 1941:148-52; 1982), the major and minor beings are invoked, ranging from God (Ama, the same word as for altar), through the earth god (Lewe), to the various lesser spirits, ending with the ancestors, the first settlers, and those people who scaled the cliffs.4 Mejugo normally would have his friend Ani help him with the invocation or with the sac- rifice proper. Ani could not come this time, so Mejugo will have to do it alone. After the rice gruel, he pours millet gruel on the altars and the statue and finally adds a tiny piece of millet cake and some millet mush, a staple food of the Dogon. Now the preliminaries to the sacrifice are out of the way. In this case two chickens are slaughtered above the altars and statue. Mejugo repeats the reason for this gift to Ama in his invocation: "Do away with the barrenness./ Do not mix the words./ This is the chicken of purification:/for the mistakes,/for the failures,/ for the bad words,/ for the evil thoughts./ Let her be pure,/ forgive us, forgive us./ Please those who have passed (the ancestors),/ do not disturb our killing (of the chicken);/ open the belly,/ let the child enter." His daughter Yasaa joins in: "All the mistakes of the mouth,/ do not listen to those./ Let our hearts be pure,/ accept our chickens./ Give me the thing I think of,/ look at me at your place (the statue, near the altar)./ Mother (her deceased grandmother), here is your chicken;/ Ama tongo (God Creator), are you there?/ Accept our chickens,/ fill my womb./ Once the Creator has come/ all discussion is finished." The little carcasses are plucked and grilled. Mejugo then puts some liver on the altars and statue: "Here, take the liver, do not take the people." When the gods have had their share, the remainder of the food is eaten by members of the family who are present: first Mejugo, then his daughter, and finally the others partake of the mush, the gruel, and the beer. This case is an example of the tradi- tional use of statues among the Dogon. A figure like the one employed here is both a person and an altar; in fact it represents someone at the altar. In sacrifice it fulfills four functions: to identify the suppli- cant, to identify his or her problem, to draw the attention of supernatural be- ings to the proceedings, and to intensify contact. In order to assess the impact of a statue on a sacrifice, let us follow the general procedure for obtaining and using one. Usually it starts with a problem; illness and infertility are the most common ones. At first sacrifices are performed on the standard altar, without a carved fig- ure. If a solution is not reached, the man or woman in question may decide to have one made. This option is some- times indicated through divination, either by the well-known method involv- ing the tracks of a fox (Griaule &amp; Dieter- len 1965:160 ff.; Pern 1982:122; Paulme 1940:223) or by the one where cowry shells are thrown. For a small fee, one of the few blacksmiths (jemen) able to carve makes the sculpture, indicating the problem it is to address. In principle it should "look like" the client, but in prac- tice faces and expressions are routinely stylized, the style varying more with the carver than with the client. In fact, in some instances statues can be reused by other people. Designation of the diffi- culty takes precedence over identification of the owner. The first time the sculpture is used, the sacrifice is performed in a slightly more elaborate way than the one performed by Mejugo. The procedure for the installa- tion of a new altar is followed, because that in fact is what a new statue is. A new altar is usually erected behind the gra- nary in which it is kept, near the place where its owner washes himself each 58</page><page sequence="2">morning, and if possible under a small overhang. The special feature of the in- stallation ceremony is the blessing of the altar/statue by the lineage elders of the village half, who arrive after the per- formance of the sacrifice to voice a loud and clear benediction over the new owner of the omono, demanding God's blessings and stressing their own best in- tentions toward him. Afterward they are given a feast of the millet beer prepared by the women of the household. The statue, wrapped in a rag, is kept in a trunk inside the house or in a special granary. During the ritual it stays next to the altar and so receives all invocations and offerings directed toward it. When the sacrifice, as I have outlined it, is over, the figure stays there for some time, often for the rest of the day. Even after everyone has left, it remains praying to God, beseeching the ancestors, drawing the attention of the supernatural world to its owner. The rationale behind the Dogon use of statues is closely interwoven with their belief system and with their system of sacrifice, so a short excursion into this realm is called for. Ama (or Amma), the sky god, is the head of a triumvirate that includes Nomo (Nommo), the water god, and Lewie (Lebe), the earth god. He is the Creator, Ama tongo, who gives rain, life. As such he is not an otiose God, for he actively engages himself in the lives of men. All sacrifices and other rituals are primarily directed toward him; his name is invoked in the countless blessings, greetings, and salutations of social interaction. Though Ama is the source of all being, animal as well as hu- man, he is also a major cause of insecu- rity. He is the god "who changes every- thing," as was expressed in the opening stanzas of the toro. The toro dwells exten- sively on this characteristic: whoever walks on the paths, Amma puts in the bush, and vice versa; he brings comfort to those who grieve, tears to those who laugh. The other two members of the triumvi- rate, Nomo and Lewe, share the am- biguity of Ama, though each in a slightly different way. As the god of open water, Nomo is the most feared of all (Griaule 1948). Conceived as a reddish person (like Westerners!) he lives in any perma- nent pool of water. Although he de- scends from heaven with the first rains, he is not so much the rain god, for it is Ama who gives and withholds the rain. (An explicit myth insists on that.) Like Ama, Nomo is a "changer": he trans- forms himself into anything red and often something dangerous. A number of familiar spirits are associated with 1. KNEELING WOMAN WITH CHILD. WOOD, 49.2cm. LESTER WUNDERMAN COLLECTION. 59</page><page sequence="3">him, of which the binu are the most im- portant, as we shall see. The earth god Lewe, who takes the form of a giant snake, has a dominant role in a founding myth of the Dogon, the one about the migration from Mande (Dieterlen 1941:184). He is important through his association with several al- tars, especially the one associated with the village as a whole. His special priest is the hogon, the oldest man of the vil- lage, who bears an important ritual re- sponsibility (Bouju 1984:167). Among his familiars Lewe counts the atiwiinii, small black beings that roam the scree between wards and villages, and who the Dogon say are the oldest inhabitants of the scree. Other associates are spirits belong- ing to the physical environment, like the yen~i, spirits of the trees, and yebd, spirits of the bush. (In most of the litera- ture - e.g., Griaule 1938a - these spirits are indicated by their Sanga names, an- doumboulou and yeban.) All are consid- ered at once important and dangerous: some major cultural elements, like mask language, stem from them, but the at'w'int" are also believed to kidnap chil- dren and attack people walking alone. By themselves, the gods cannot be trusted with continuous care of their off- 2.

They are both helpful and threatening; they give blessings but can also kill people. Yet one has to depend upon these unpredictable beings. The sculptures help in the interaction be- tween men and this ambiguous super- natural world. Though bolstered by his family group, for the most part the indi- vidual faces Ama by himself. A statue serves somewhat as an intermediary, addressing the Creator on the suppli- cant's behalf, directing the gods' atten- tion, which is thought to be of limited span, and refreshing their reputedly poor memories. As the Dogon say, "One cannot always pray and kneel at the altar, but the statue can!" Thus carved figures are not ancestors but rather representations of the living.6 The Dogon do have ancestors - de- ceased kinsmen some of whom they know by name, but whom they usually address collectively. To some extent, an- cestors may serve on behalf of the living as intermediaries with Ama; the toro is explicit about that. Their role in religion, however, is small. The abode of the dead is vague and their place in the lives of their descendants is of minor impor- tance. Rather it is Ama who is addressed first and foremost directly by the living. Characteristically the toro starts with the invocation to the Creator God and only then proceeds to the lower beings. The latter are invoked as separate beings with their own potential for good and harm. The ancestors come at the end of the list; one may ask them to plead with God, but that is not a prominent request. Neither do they receive any special at- tention in sacrifice or other rituals. For the Dogon, the statues function in a way similar to that of ancestors in other African religions (Uchendu 1976:291). Yet, one might say that in structuralist terms they are "inverted ancestors," as their relevant characteristics are exactly opposed to those of ancestors. For example, among other African peoples ancestors are deceased kinsmen who control their offspring, punish or bless them, and have their own well-being at heart together with that of their depen- dents. In contrast, statues have never lived, and are created and controlled by the living from whom they spring; they have no volition or any goals of their own to pursue.7 By the logic that governs this kind of thought process, opposite elements of pairs may serve a comparable function and purpose, but in a different way (Levi-Strauss 1964:123 ff.). That holds true here. In Africa religions where ances- tors are important (thus not among the Dogon), both ancestors and statues intervene between man and the super- natural world. In the case of ancestors, the living apprehend ancestral interven- tion through misfortune: problems or illnesses are interpreted as corrective measures of the deceased but watchful kinsmen. Though sometimes their de- scendants may be aware of transgres- sions, often divination has to be per- formed to know exactly what has gone wrong. Divination indicates both the diagnosis and the cure. The latter fre- quently takes the form of sacrifice, in which the ancestors are appeased, put at rest, and reassured of the fundamental allegiance of the living toward the dead. Statues may also be employed in times of stress and misfortune, but for their use no divination is needed, as problems do not originate from them. These figures serve to stir the supernatural world out of its inherent lethargy, into specific ac- tion. Misfortune is viewed not so much as a corrective but as the consequence of a lack of attention. Besides, in this kind of sacrifice, it is not the wishes of the ances- tors that are heeded, but the aims and goals of the living: statues stress the in- dividual wishes of their owners. As we shall see, the individualistic aspects of the use of these objects almost guaran- tee that some will be utilized for goals that run counter to the social or- der. Of course, the aims of the ancestors and those of individuals are in harmony; ancestors are often interpreted by re- searchers as representations and reflec- tions of the social order (Norbeck 1974:45 ff.; Holas 1965). Without sacrifice a statue would be a simple baga (piece of wood); with sac- rifice it is a dege, the Dogon term for pro- tective statue. It serves both as an addi- tion to the altar in question and as an 60</page><page sequence="4">altar in its own right, filling a special niche in the ritual environment. Dogon villages are replete with altars, their size and location varying from community to community. There is one for each social unit: village, village half, ward, clan, lineage, age group, household, and in- dividual. In addition to these, special al- tars address specific problems (such as drought or locusts) or belong to specific groups (herdsmen, hunters, etc.). Though the generic name of the altar - in fact, of the sacrifice - is omono, and though each may be termed ama - as a place to invoke Ama - these different types have their own names: for exam- ple, I'w'e (village altar), pegu (village-half altar), babinu (ward altar), amay'ew'e (clan/ lineage altar). Those for individuals and families are simply called ama plus the name of the person in question. Some of the special altars have their own names. Dogon altars form an open system, the adding of new ones and the discarding of old ones being a normal pattern. The construction of an altar and the per- formance of sacrifices on it are largely op- tional. (Only the lineage and clan elders and the ward priests are obligated to sac- 4.

People follow their own inclina- tions and respond to their own problems in the performance of the traditional reli- gion. The same freedom characterizes the use of statues. Most of the altar types do not feature them at all; an earthen cone, some of them portable, is fully suf- ficient. Statues are used in individual and household sacrifices (like the one I have described), in some lineage altars, and in the ward shrine, the binu ginu. Most serve in the household setting. The figure is called the guyo togu ama, after the guyo togu, a special type of granary used for the storage of valuables, not cereals. The entry is low and the door rather wide. Old men sometimes live there. The shrines of the ward priests are the most prominent among the altars featur- ing statues. In principle each ward house consists of several clans (Paulme 1940: 165 ff.) and is linked to the supernatural world by a binu ginu, the house of the binu. Binu spirits are thought to possess people, at their own whim and at the per- son's inclination. Those possessed thus receive a call to serve both the binu and their community as special priests or priestesses (respectively binuk'eju, the "one who accompanies the binu," and amayanu, the "woman of God"). After passing a test, in which the new priest must find the beads belonging to a de- ceased predecessor while in trance, the binuk'eju builds or restores the shrine, a small houselike construction dedicated to these spirits (Fig. 2). A dege statue is often found among the paraphernalia in- side (Fig. 3). This cult is sometimes called totemic (Griaule 1938a:267), since each shrine is associated with a particular animal, frequently represented by a fig- ure sculpture. The totem of the binu in Figure 3 is the hyena. Often these statues are very plain, made with a minimum of detail; sometimes they are just one or more uncarved sticks. However, in con- trast to the statues for individuals, they may be preserved for quite a long time. In this case their very age is important, as they are not the representations of the binu but rather their resting place; the binu have manifested themselves through these dege. These spirits are closely associated with Nomo, the water god. In some cases Nomo himself is de- picted in a sculpture, belonging to such a shrine, as a cross between a crocodile and a man or woman (Fig. 4).8 Such examples are, however, not very com- mon; people know of only a few places where such a Nomo shrine exists. Sacrificing on the statue is identical to sacrificing on the earthen altar. Despite the identification with the client, the sculpture, like any intermediary, is sub- ject to the same processes that govern al- tars in Dogon religion. The major point is that their association with the capricious supernatural world tarnishes them with similar characteristics. Sacrificing on an altar or on a statue enhances its power (panga).9 A statue that has served for a long time and has been used in many sacrifices therefore becomes dangerous. While its effectiveness grows as well, the negative aspects increase more quickly than the beneficial ones: Ama gets a bit too close for comfort. In the right amount, then, sacrifice is commendable and necessary. In the Dogon view, there should be a balance between need and fulfillment. This notion of balance is cen- tral in their social life (van Beek 1983a). This is one important reason why statues are discarded after they have been in use for a while. They normally do not last a person's lifetime. Of course, if the problem is solved, the dege is no longer needed. Still, as we shall see, many of these sculptures are open to var- ious interpretations and may serve as a multifunctional instrument, a ritual aspi- rin. After functioning for a period of time, whether the particular problem has been solved or not, the statue is put back in its hiding place. One must respect its power and not terminate its use too ab- ruptly, as total neglect would result in an "attack" on the very people it was created to represent. Sacrifices should be made at gradually decreasing intervals until, at long last, the statue is put at the bottom of the granary or trunk to be for- gotten. The figure then enters its final phase, when it is rediscovered by the descen- dants of its original user, usually after the owner's death. For them it represents their deceased father, grandfather, or grandmother. At some important ritual moments they may even exhibit such sculptures to show off their "ancestors." As an example, during the ritual that is called buro (or bulu), which marks the beginning of the rainy season (Pern 1982), statues that have fallen into disuse by the death of their clients may be dis- played on the top of the main house in the compound. In a few cases, descen- dants will reuse the figure for their own benefit; the dege will be considered to represent the new client. Usually, how- ever, the old statues remain inactive. With time, they become associated with the deceased, but in that capacity they do not function in ritual, and they are no longer powerful. Let us now look at the iconography of these objects as it is interpreted by the Dogon themselves. Most statues repre- sent people, male and female. They are usually made to "pray" on behalf of their original owner. Many expressions of prayer are possible: a standing dege with hands raised high is praying (Fig. 6); but 62</page><page sequence="6">7. EQUESTRIAN FIGURE. WOOD, 23cm. MADE FOR THE AUTHOR. 8.

Hands high or low, the figure kneeling or standing - all postures are used in addressing God. Not all statues, however, depict people in prayer. Generally a figure with both hands up indicates either a specific de- mand (often rain) or protection against danger and evil (e.g., spirits or sorcery). Statues with two hands raised may also be used in the altars of the clan and lineages or of the village half; in these cases they are sacrificed upon at the most important ritual of the year, the buro. Sometimes the dege depicts its owner in the state he or she wants to achieve. A figure sitting on a stool indicates a per- son who wants to be or remain ala pe ("in harmony") with his world (Fig. 5). In the case of a woman, the legs of the stool often depict figures that can be inter- preted as children, evoking the rich and contented state of a mother. Men's stools usually do not feature children. For them sitting indicates authority: the spoken word from a seated person (see Calame-Griaule 1965:256). The numerous statues of men proud- ly mounted on horses are intriguing (Fig. 7). It would be easy to assume that the Dogon had horses in the past, but neither the archaeological evidence (see Bedaux, p. 38) nor oral history provides sufficient grounds for that. Horses appar- ently have always been very scarce in Dogon country. The present-day Dogon interpret equestrian figures in two ways. According to the first, they depict people who would like to see themselves as rich and powerful, or who have a position in which they are obliged to be so, such as the Hogon of Aru (Dieterlen 1982). A mounted figure is thus either a pious wish, indicating to Ama what kind of blessings are sought, or a kind of heral- dry, showing a dignitary with the trap- pings appropriate to his rank. A second line of interpretation of the equestrian carvings is that they repre- sent bush spirits; y'en'eii, for instance, may appear in the form of mounted fig- ures to someone casually strolling by. Such an apparition is threatening in- deed. If it occurs, a statue of the spirit in question should be carved and sacrifices performed in order to ward off the dan- gers and illnesses associated with it. Fig- ures interpreted in these two ways can- not be differentiated, as the carvings of horses are quite stylized. Statues other than horses and riders also represent apparitions seen in a vis- ion or dream, prompting many unusual forms, like the nine-headed example in Figure 8. The frightened person orders a sculpture in its likeness and sacrifices on it, often after consulting the diviner. Its principal function is to ward off danger and prevent the illness that otherwise would inevitably accompany this kind of revelation. 63</page><page sequence="7">Details such as scarification may sim- ply serve to identify the maker/client (Fig. 10), while many other details, often quite unobtrusive, help to identify the problem. Small surface irregularities may indicate leprosy. A large omphalic protrusion is another kind of affliction. A figure putting its hands on the head hints at chronic headaches. A statue's large feet may help to heal endemic parasitic diseases of the foot. A curved back reminds Ama of the humpback that has to be healed. Some problems are - in our eyes - less serious: a figure's short, irregular beard may indicate that it does not grow well. Not all of these sculptures are beneti- cial, nor do the altars always help all people. There is dark side to the sac- rifices on the omono, well hidden by the Dogon (van Beek, forthcoming), which should be included in our interpretation and evaluation of the statues. Just as any altar of long use becomes dangerous and demands sacrifices "on its own," so it is with the sculptures. People who want to hurt others use the very same altars that may also protect. If malevolent, the altar owners may endclose some hideous things in the earthen Ama-cone, like parts of a body. There is a special kind of figure that is connected with this kind of altar: the toii, a vaguely anthropomorphic statue made of pottery (Fig. 9). This is not a dege, as it does not protect; the toii is only harmful. The Dogon word dege thus encompas- ses a slightly different range of objects than the term "statue." While for us morphology is dominant, for the Dogon the function - protection and healing- is foremost. For example, a bracelet made to protect a house from malevolent strangers is called a dege, just like the small brass plaque that may be nailed on or under the doorstep to achieve the same end. The material from which it is made is unimportant: it can be wood or metal (though not pottery). Figure 11 shows a standard dege made of brass, a form used in the Seno plain. The Dogon would view this exactly as they would a wood sculpture, as it has a similar func- tion. As we have seen, statues fade out of the religious system, ending up in the dusty recesses of the guyo togu, wrapped in rags or a goatskin bag. These days they are almost always sold to tourists or art merchants. As these dege have lost their function and are only relics of a for- gotten past, their sale entails almost no consequences for the Dogon religion. (However, the prices for statues have risen so high as to incite people to steal ones that are still in use; that is an en- tirely different matter, of course.) One curious consequence of this pattern of creation, use, and abandonment of statues is that since the old ones were "portraits" of people who have since died, the Dogon who sell them to tourists and merchants may be telling the truth when they say the figures rep- resent ancestors. What they fail to say is that for that very reason their ritual value has become nil. This brings us to the value of Dogon artifacts on the external market. The Dogon are very much aware of the value that outsiders attach to the "things of old" and consequently to old things, so they identify their dege as ancestors, or they give them the look of age. The de- mands of the art and tourist market have triggered a quick response, especially among tanners and blacksmiths. Whereas the production of statues for traditional use has declined, that of statues for sale has become a thriving in- dustry. The Dogon smear these new carvings with kitchen soot, bury them for a few weeks near a termite mound, soak them in millet gruel, and dry them in hot ashes, all to give them the highly valued patina of long ritual use. Finally they try to sell them as "Tellem." This term, which can be used to denote a pre- cise and datable civilization (see Bedaux, p. 38), in the language of the contempo- rary art market should be translated as: "We hope to convince you it is old." Objects newly made for the tourist market do not differ significantly in style or level of craftsmanship from the ones used in sacrifice. The canons for making a dege are the same, whether it will be used in the proper way or not. For the Dogon, any aesthetic appreciation - if relevant at all - follows far behind use and function. For example, statues used in ritual action are often less elaborate, more simply carved, and less detailed than the ones sold on the market. Binu figures (Fig. 3) that represent "super- natural beings" are extremely simple, to the point of not even being carved at all. This does not affect their ritual function and effectiveness. Details in sculpture, as we have seen, indicate the identity, problems, and goals of the owner; con- sequently statues depicting nonhumans will be less elaborate. The statues function only while rela- tively "young," as an immediate re- sponse to a more or less urgent complaint. They are valued as new objects, not as old ones. The same holds for other ritual paraphernalia, like masks. These too serve only when new, brightly colored, and without signs of wear and tear. Masks have to be fabricated for each mask festival (dama); those used in past festivals can be discarded, that is, sold. The patina of long usage, so prized by Europeans, has no appeal. One infor- mant jokingly told me: "We can have children from our wives when they are young; the Europeans will cherish them when they are aged, lined, and worn out." It is a very nice economic set-up for the Dogon: they can use their objects and afterward sell them at an increased price. Nor are other aspects of Western aesthetic appreciation - "artistic" bal- ance, the creative tension of selective disproportion, the deliberate choice be- tween detail and contour, the evocative focus on specific parts of the body - shared by the Dogon. For them, function is dominant. The functionality of the ob- ject depends on general aspects of pro- portion (e.g., very elongated wooden figurines may be used for hitching horses) and details that designate the problem and the client. The Dogon value elaboration because such specific details as clothing, implements, hairstyles, and scarification allow them to infer not only the purpose of the statue but also the so- cial identity of the owner. A figure is 'esiko (good) if it depicts what it is supposed to depict, does what it is supposed to do. Within the confines of function, some aesthetic appreciation may operate. Objects, then, are appraised according to function and information about people - how they operate in terms of social relations. The Dogon are by no means atypical in this respect. Most non-Western cultures do not share our notions of aesthetic quality. This holds for not only artifacts, but also for aspects of the environment. The villages located on the Bandiagara escarpment are con- sidered to be among the most strikingly beautiful settings in West Africa. Once, 9. TOO FIGURE, USED IN SORCERY. POTTERY, 16.3cm.

The millet is really growing well this year." Anthropologists have long and con- vincingly argued that judgments about aesthetic quality are culture bound. The comparison between Dogon and West- ern appreciation of statues provides fur- ther evidence of that. The distinction be- tween the beautiful and the com- monplace functions within Western societies, not in traditional African ones. In a culture like the Dogon's, the division between "art" and "craft" has no rele- vance whatsoever. We may speak about African art in the context of our own so- ciety, our own museums and galleries, and publish splendid journals on the subject. We are entitled to our own, if ethnocentric, cultural opinions and to follow our own aesthetic views. But we should be careful lest we project our value judgments upon Africa. 0 Notes, page 91 IN ............ .. .. ..... .. ZNIZ,,-? P 10.

The umlaut indicates nasalization of the vowel in question. 4. For a more detailed description of a Dogon toro and sacrifice, seePern, 1982:92ff., Dieterlen 1941:112, 1982:117, and vanBeek 1983b. 5. The term "supernatural" is not very apt for the Dogon religion, but is used for the sake of convenience. The term evokes a dichotomy between natural and supernatural that does not correspond well with Dogon thought. 6. Following Griaule and Dieterlen (1965:352 ff.) most past authors have interpreted Dogon sculptures as ancestors. This is almost a routine interpretation of African sculpture. As explained, this notion is not true for Dogon religion. Further- more, the interpretation of the figurines as mythical ancestors strikes no chord with my informants. 7. In the following list of opposed traits, those of the ancestors form the first half of each opposition, those of statues the second half: kinsman or kinswoman/non-kin; superior status/no status of their own; old/new; deceased human/inanimate; create humans/created by humans; control the living/controlled by the living; impose own norms on volition/express norms and volition of others; own well-being is important/no well-being of their own; addressed collectively/used individually. 8. The statues described as "nommo" in the literature (Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1965:352) were not identified as Nomo by my in- formants, who routinely classified them personal dege. 9. The notion of nyama, mentioned in the literature as the super- natural force (Griaule 1938a:161), is of Bambara origin and is not significant in the context of Dogon religion (Calame-Griaule 1968:228).</page></plain_text>
