<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HUMANITIES1 James Wiseman ARCHAEOLOGY IS ESSENTIALLY HUMANISTIC; ITS AIM, IN THE WORDS of Sir Leonard Woolley, is "through the dead-and-gone things to get at the history and the minds of dead-and-gone men."2 This claim of the humanities on archaeology is in some sense self evident, but it needs saying from time to time: technological con tributions in archaeology have so far outstripped humanistic ones that we are apt to forget the real goal. Archaeology has, in fact, come to be governed by a scientific attitude backed up by a long list of specialists, and it has taken on the appearance of what it em phatically is not, a separate scientific discipline. Rhys Carpenter discusses this new prosopon in an essay on archaeological studies in which he stresses this unfortunate "technical transformation" by devoting more than three-fourths of the article to technical advances (various archaeometric devices, surveying by aerial pho tography, etc.). That weighted division is especially significant because the essay is in a series of volumes examining humanistic scholarship in America. But Carpenter clearly felt he had no choice: "It is very significant that while this country has stood well to the fore in technological advance in archaeological pro cedure, having shown conspicuous aptitude for devising and putting into operation accessory scientific methods of detec tion, critical examination, and preservation of material, at the same time it has left no corresponding mark in humanistic studies related to these material results."3 Carpenter's criticism of archaeology is a severe one, however politely expressed, for it bares the scholar's failure to pay suffi cient attention to what is really important in archaeology, what in fact lends it any significance at all: the relation between the ancient remains and mankind. This failure is the result of a de humanizing process that Carpenter recognized in 1933 when he said there was an urgent need for "a new brand of archaeologist, for an archaeologist who is able to philosophize and not afraid to speculate. For I do not see how, otherwise, there will be any humanistic value in archaeology."4 The rapid technological ad 1 Art and Archaeology, by James S. Ackerman and Rhys Carpenter.

Works of a broader and more general nature than the favored analytic and descriptive reports, and books of a philosophical and speculative sort were left mainly to colleagues in related fields or to laymen. Technology actually obscured archaeology's aim by its successes and thus became an internal danger in spite of its important contributions. Technology alone, or mainly, was not enough. "The present-day attempt to rescue archaeology at the ex pense of humanism is the greatest evil which can befall it; for it is only in so far as archaeology illuminates the tradi tional classical humanism with a new radiance that it de serves to shed its beam at all. And just as the greatness of Greek studies is not the mere knowledge of Greek which they confer, but through knowledge of Greek a comprehen sion of high clear thought, self-conscious form, and flawless speech?qualities which transcend all local and racial bar riers?so the greatness of archaeological studies cannot lie in the mere accumulation of a systematic knowledge of cultural and artistic antiquities."5 Carpenter's "new brand of archaeologist" has failed to appear (at least there is no mention of him in the new essay), and Car penter apparently feels that his earlier fears for the future of archaeology have been realized. This must have made the writing of his recent article a discouraging chore. The optimism in the earlier book?which was apparent despite Carpenter's specific (and correct) appraisal of the dehumanizing trend?has been replaced by a somewhat wistful longing that archaeology advance beyond its analytic-descriptive phase to a "more mature" one "in which humanistic understanding should supplant technological competence."6 Such a change is natural and perhaps inevitable, if only because the methodical arranging of information is unsatis fying, providing us with the means and no proper end: the in formation must still be correlated and interpreted in terms of cul tural significance. This alone, it seems to me, is cause for more optimism than Carpenter expresses. Besides, I believe there are indications that we are on the verge of entering that "more ma ture phrase," provided we can insure that the dehumanization proceed no further. Actually it cannot proceed much further since the process is nearly complete: almost all that is required is the claim that the ancient remains and their detailed description are in fact the purpose of archaeological studies. If this claim were admitted, archaeology would of course be cut off even more com 5 Ibid., 132. 6 Art and Archaeology, 15.</page><page sequence="3">James Wiseman 133 pletely from (now) related pursuits. Writers of broader interpre tive works, whatever their credentials, would have to confess that they are performing non-archaeological tasks, and archaeology would, then, be an independent discipline and a scientific one at that. Certain aspects of archaeology's present status and some of the reasons for the decline of humanistic interests indicate that the answer to archaeology's problem is not as simple as it might ap pear. Any suggestion, for example, that archaeologists rise en masse to swear allegiance to humanism and reject technology is not only impractical but undesirable. After all, it is not technol ogy that dehumanized archaeology: the technological advances are important and to ignore them or long for a return to more primitive methods would be reactionary and downright foolish. It is only common sense that sounder interpretations can be ob tained by using more and better information. We want and need the specialists in pottery and architecture, the experts in stylistic analysis or more purely scientific work such as radiocarbon dating. And while we may deplore the specialist's control of archaeology because it is subversive of archaeology's purpose, we have to admit that the leadership is his by default. We need more synthe sizers, more who take a broader view of antiquity, more of the philosophical and speculative archaeologists of whom Carpenter wrote. It is our failure to produce such scholars in larger number that has hurt archaeology most. Meanwhile, scholars are urged toward specialization from sev eral quarters. Internally, the very mass of available data precludes total mastery and is an inducement to narrower interests. Outside the field, but bearing directly on it, is the overly-departmental ized university which, in its emphasis on training professionals (philologists, archaeologists, veterinarians) to perform specific jobs, provides an antiseptic environment suited to the flourishing of academic specialization. And in practice strict specialization protects and perpetuates itself by infecting its adherents in many cases with narrow-minded self-interest so that they become less willing (or able) to communicate with experts in other areas, much less the world at large. An even worse result is that all too often the specialist seems to consider attempts by others to use his tools as an unwanted intrusion by alien minds or even an attack on his own academic capabilities. This, of course, makes any in terpretive work automatically suspect. Finally, many scholars quite naturally pass on to prot?g?s their own specialty or a sub division of it. This self-generating power is especially clear in the study of Greek pottery. Careful analyses by such scholars as Sir J. D. Beaz ley and G. M. A. Richter have made it possible, as Carpenter points out, to date within a decade the manufacture of a vase made in Greece between 650 and 350 B.C. Most Greek vases of</page><page sequence="4">134 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HUMANITIES certain types (Attic Black- or Red-Figured) have even been as signed to specific painters. But the first really usable volume at tempting to assimilate the great amount of material in the various studies is R. M. Cook's Greek Painted Pottery (1960). Any type of general discussion of Greek painted pottery as an art form (including criticism) or examination of its place in Greek life is a rare thing. But the journals and libraries are full of catalogs and stylistic studies that seem to multiply themselves. For example, one of the most recent of the many offspring of Beazley's great indices of Attic Black- and Red-Figured vasepainters is a mono graph on Red-Figured rhyta.7 The author looks upon this as the beginning of a restudy of all Greek vases to classify them now by potter instead of painter. This book and others like it can be sig nificant scholarly contributions and I suppose that the task pro posed will eventually be accomplished. That it will result in some thing more, however, than another little-used series of volumes gathering dust in the library is unlikely unless more archaeologists appear who are willing to use such studies to get at man's history, his thought, and his art. Studies of other types of ancient remains have been as exten sive, and in some areas (architecture and sculpture) we are more fortunate in the number of general studies. Our understanding of Greek architectural principles, for example, has reached the point where it is now possible, after a study of several structural ele ments, to reconstruct an entire ancient building. The Stoa of At talos II (159-138 B.C.) in the Athenian Agora was restored entirely (1953-1956) with only minor interior changes to make it serviceable as a museum. Perhaps even more spectacular is the reconstruction (on paper) by William Bell Dinsmoor of a temple ?the largest in the Peloponnesos?on the basis of fragments of a column drum and an architrave block, both of which had been re-used in later constructions.8 But despite the extent of our spe cific knowledge of Greek architecture and availability of a few works of broad scope,9 most architectural studies are still con cerned strictly with date, form, style and function and fail to treat the buildings or monuments as works of art or as intimations of the psychology, philosophy and intellectual record of man. Even rarer are studies that correlate the several areas of archaeology and attempt to view ancient remains in their historic or artistic context.

All are brief treatments but are full of insight and go beyond any mere gathering and grouping of information. But before counting the blessings at hand there is another, and perhaps the most important, reason for archaeology's "technical transformation." I refer to the long decline of humanistic interest within classical philology?a decline which led to such a concen tration on textual and historical minutiae that form and content came to be slighted and sometimes completely ignored. It was as if the application of the term "classical" to literature rendered criticism, philosophical and psychological interpretations, or any speculative consideration of the substance, unnecessary. It became possible, for instance, to discuss a poem in terms of meter, vocabu lary and structure with little or no attention to it as a work of art. Philology's dehumanization was bound to affect archaeology, and other studies as well, for it is philology that has always shaped our approach to the study of classical antiquity. Whether or not philology has merited its power is beside the point; its command is a fact and its emphasis on detailed analysis did carry over into archaeology. Considering how many archaeologists have also been trained philologists and that archaeology itself in its begin ning was chiefly an offshoot of litterae humaniores, it would have been more remarkable if archaeology had not adopted much of philology's method and shared in its decline as a humanity. Philology's plight has long been recognized and there has been much talk and a few efforts in recent years to do something about it. One of the most important and promising of these undertak ings is the new Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. Its attitude, however, toward archaeology is unfortunate. Ber nard M. W. Knox, in an address at the Center's dedication last year, mourned the scarcity in Greek studies of "great and original scholars" and "influential interpreters of the Greek heritage for all civilized men." The Center, he hoped, would encourage the humanistic side of classics and foster a new rise of great men after the cut of Sir James Frazer. That he was able to mention the name of Frazer and at the same time, and almost in the same breath, to deny classical archaeology a place at the Center points up not only the melancholy position in which archaeology finds itself but also, in part, how it got there. The philologists helped put it where it is. The Center is surely right in its efforts toward a return to clas sical humanism or, in the terms of its founder's gift, "to revitalize the ideals of ancient Greece." But to interpret this to mean merely the study of works written in Greek is to encourage the same spe cialistic domination the Center hopes to overcome. It fails to rec ognize that the goal of archaeology is the same as that of the other pursuits that together make up the study of classical an</page><page sequence="6">136 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HUMANITIES tiquity. It implies that the contemplation of unlettered material remains can produce only negligible indications of the thoughts, history and even art (!) of the ancient Greeks, or, worse, that these are found exclusively in written works. The Center, of course, could never have intended to foster such an absurdity. It is far more likely that archaeology's exclusion resulted in part from a latent but still persistent specialist's leaning toward a dis tinct separation of fields. An even more cogent reason may have been the feeling that archaeology, however closely tied to literary studies, was simply too far gone to be rescued from the sciences. The latter is implicit in Knox's charges against archaeology. He says it "demands rigid specialization, a severe attention to minute detail, and, above all, it concentrates the scholar's attention on things rather than men and ideas." All of these contentions may reasonably be questioned. First, archaeology does not by its nature demand "rigid specialization" any more than philology does. That both have produced special ists in large number is true and sad in that their number has not been matched by scholars with a more humanistic bent, but is not proof that such is the natural state of either. The nature of the pursuit is determined by the goal, not its practice at the moment: otherwise, philology itself, with its concentration on textual criti cism, exegesis and grammar, might as well be excluded and the Center close its doors. Second, "severe attention to minute detail" is characteristic of archaeological studies but is not, I insist, an end in itself. This criticism seems to overlook the fact that a humanistic approach does not imply the subjugation of fact. It also overlooks an analogous procedure in such special philological studies as the counting of caesurae and diareses in Greek or Roman poetry, the use of the dative in this or that author, vo cabulary studies, (with or without the aid of an electronic com puter), et al. But there is nothing inherently anti-humanistic about a careful search for exact information. It is when it de generates to mere trivality that it becomes what it is in any aca demic endeavor?the predilection of second-rate minds. Third, that archaeology "concentrates the scholar's attention on things rather than men and ideas" may be the dominant practice at the moment, but is certainly not the aim of archaeology. The archae ologist is (or should be) interested in far more than the objects themselves. All attempts to limit the function of the archaeologist in such a way must be resisted since they would push him com pletely into the realm of science and further weaken the already sick humanities. They must be resisted, too, because they imply that the study of classical antiquity is coextensive with the study of classical literature, which in turn often seems coextensive with classical philology cut off from criticism. Archaeology can reach beyond the remains to man and his thoughts, and it must do so if it is to be of value in itself and</page><page sequence="7">James Wiseman 137 also give greater substance to what we learn from other sources. However literate his society, man is not so simple that what he says and how he says it fully reveal him and his times. He is far too complicated, too deceptive (even to himself) for such uni form understanding. Who could seriously maintain that sheer physical environment, let alone the ideas that created it, plays no part in the moulding of man's personality or, especially in times of radical change, indicates nothing of his thoughts, feelings and abilities? Architecture can be as eloquent a witness to man's con cept of himself and his world as a poem. In Hellenic studies it is Athens of the second half of the fifth century B.C. that has most occupied our interest, and with good reason. There have been no people more keenly aware of their own greatness, nor any who made it more manifest than Perikles' contemporaries. Surely there has been no other period or place so productive of literary genius. But the same can be said of several of the other arts and they too must be considered if we are to arrive at anything approaching an understanding of that age. A study of the Periklean building program which explored its artistic, political, economic and psychological implications could make a valuable contribution to such an understanding. It was this program which Plutarch said "conferred on Athens its greatest delight and adornment and brought to all other men the deepest amazement, and which alone bears witness for Hellas that her storied might and prosperity of long ago were no lie."10 There is no space here even for an outline of so large a study, but a few brief suggestions may indicate some of its possible features. We might begin with the confirmation of Perikles' political in fluence demonstrated by the carrying-out of this immense project (which, we are told, was more vehemently opposed by Perikles' enemies than any of his other public acts. ) But that influence is so well attested on other grounds that it would be unnecessary to mention it here if we were not able to see the wielding of that influence, and some of the actual machinations involved, in the time-table of the program and in the several postponements and alterations of specific constructions. Perikles seems to have initi ated the program cautiously, with much of the early planning done in secret. The scope and especially the speed of the pro gram, once begun, at least indicate that it had been in the plan ning stage for some time before it was announced (449 or, per haps, 450). It could not have been much later than 454, when the treasury of the Delian League was moved from Delos to the Athenian Acropolis, that the first plans were laid, and it may well 10 Perikles, 12, 1.</page><page sequence="8">138 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HUMANITIES have been earlier. Pheidias must have been placed in overall command of the program before the planning had proceeded very far and other prominent artists and architects would have had to be summoned in advance. There were also a few commissions in the 450s, the most important of which was Pheidias' Athena Pro machos on the Acropolis. This colossal bronze of the warrior goddess, whose spear point's gleam was said to have been visible to sailors rounding Sounion, could not have been intended to stand alone for long among the ruins of her chief sanctuaries. Her presence was a rebuke to the city that had risen above the ashes (like the new Athena) the Persians left to found an em pire (i.e., the Delian League), but still retained the look of a conquered city. The contrast must have appeared all the more marked once the enormous treasure of the League was placed on the Acropolis?probably in a small and much-repaired build ing on the southwest side of the citadel. To a generation that knew Salamis and Plataia only as childhood memories and glorious tales of their fathers, their burned shrines must have long seemed sordid and unnecessary reminders of Persian strength, while the oath sworn after Plataia not to rebuild their sanctuaries would have been even more galling. For the Persians, whose blasphemy the ruins were to memorialize, were no longer a threat, and Athens herself was stronger and more prosperous than ever before. There may have been a need for such reminders in 479, or after Eurymedon when Kimon placed fire-scarred frag ments of Athena's unfinished temple in the north wall of the Acropolis overlooking the agora. But it seemed better to these new Masters of the Aegean to glorify their city, as the event proved, not by tidied-up ruins but by works of art, whatever the old veterans might say. The Promachos was a tantalizing hint of what could be done and so was the Stoa Poikile, with murals by Polygnotos, also raised in that decade. The program's first undertaking (begun in 449) was the Temple of Hephaistos and Athena on the Kolonos Agoraios at the west edge of the agora. Important in itself, the work on this temple also offered concrete promise of the greatness to come and was psychologically important as a preparation for the main task ?the complete refurbishing of the Acropolis. As Charles Morgan said, "The Acropolis was the obvious spot [for the first building] but also the most sensitive, so he [Perikles] deftly began with another."11 The move was brilliant: since there was no earlier sanctuary on the site, the program was inaugurated without violating the oath of 479. In this respect the strategy was so successful that the oath seems to have vanished as an effective political issue. The significance of this maneuver was simply lost 11 "The Sculptures of the Hephaisteion. IV. The Building," Hesperia 32 (1963), 104.</page><page sequence="9">James Wiseman 139 on a city caught up in an economic and building boom that was just beginning. The Hephaisteion was thought of, correctly, not as a single building, important as it was, but as the first in a long list of constructions throughout Attica. And the work was under way in one of the most conspicuous sites in Athens, forcefully reminding the citizens of the dreariness of the principal sanctu aries. (Even the holiest image of Athens was still lodged in a temporary baldacchino on the Acropolis). Besides the adornment of the city that the new building promised, there was an im mediate economic impact: large crews of laborers, many of whom had been forced into idleness by the swollen ranks of slaves, found employment in Athens and in the quarries. The program's continuance was, in their eyes, clearly an economic event of the first order. Despite the significance of the Hephaesteion, work was halted before it was completed, and the temple was left without roof or pediments and most of its sculptured decoration until, prob ably, the Peace of Nikias. Since it is inconceivable that the work moved along slowly enough to make the Peloponnesian War the occasion for its interruption, we are faced with the fact that its construction was halted in the midst of the great building pro gram. A search for reasons for the suspension of work, and its effect on the Athenians, might be expected to reveal (inter alia) more of Perikles' political maneuvers and some information about how he dispersed the money allocated for the buildings, some thing of the status of architects of the time and, in particular, something further about the nameless architect who designed not only this temple and the earlier Stoa Poikile, but also the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion, the Temple of Nemesis at Rhamnous and the Temple of Ares. Morgan has already suggested, in a highly perceptive examination of some of the problems of the Hephais teion,12 that the workmen were gradually removed by the overseer of the whole program. Pheidias, for work on the Parthenon (be gun in 447). There is no doubt about the priority of the Parthe non, but even if we say that the Propylaia (begun in 438) inherited that priority, it is unlikely that the shift of emphasis to the Acropolis is a full explanation of the long delay. There were numerous other constructions being carried on at this time, too, so that the masterpieces on the citadel obviously did not require all the stonemasons and other craftsmen in the city. More importantly, the Hephaisteion architect himself undertook new commissions. A more convincing argument might be made by em phasizing a growing animosity between the Hephaisteion archi tect and Pheidias who had summoned Iktinos, probably an alien, to design the Parthenon (destined by its site, function, scale and genius of the architects?Kallikrates was associated with Iktinos ? Ibid., 105-107.</page><page sequence="10">140 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HUMANITIES ?to be a far more important temple). The architect of the Hephaisteion found his glory stolen before it was fully realized. The priority of the Parthenon would have involved key master craftsmen, choice materials and budget, all at the expense of the Hephaisteion. These frustrations and a highly probable jealousy may well have caused the architect to have work on the He phaisteion shut down: he was apparently influential enough to keep it that way. Such influence may seem surprising, but there is some corroborating evidence for his importance: 1) he was the only architect to have a recent important commission in Athens prior to the new program; 2) he had been chosen to inaugurate the program with an important temple near the Agora; 3) he was an architect of imagination and talent?there is no disgrace in ranking after Iktinos, Mnesikles and Kallikrates; 4) he was prominent enough, even after the abandonment of the Hephai steion, to secure at least three other important commissions in Perikles' program. It is worth noting that all three were in out lying districts where his work would have involved less contact with and interference from Pheidias.13 There were other postponements (Temple of Athena Nike, probably the Erechtheion) and changes in plan (the Propylaia) that can be detected and the relations they imply among Perikles, his associates, and the various priesthoods could also be profitably looked into. But I have said nothing yet about the artistic and cultural value of the program and this, after all, must have been the driving force behind it all. Culture cannot be forced upon an ignorant populace; wealth can perhaps produce an occasional derivative masterpiece in a barbaric land, but a national program of architecture, sculpture and paintings by artists of the first rank demands a people capable of appreciating them. The artistic sensitivity of the Athenians was Perikles' strongest ally and in sured the eventual success of the program: Athens' wealth only provided a means and her impoverished appearance only an excuse. This artistic sensitivity of the Athenians should be further ex plored and what better way than through the works of art? One of the first results of that inquiry, I believe, would be the dis pelling of the persistent myth about "Greek simplicity" which the Greeks themselves, especially the Athenians, seemed to want to perpetuate. Even an elementary study of fifth century Greek sculpture reveals it as anything but simple. In nude statues the careful proportioning of the parts of the body, inter-relating each smaller unit with the next larger and so on until the entire figure 13 We do not know where the Temple of Ares was located before it was moved to the center of the Agora in the time of Augustus. H. A. Thompson thinks it may have been at Acharnai (A.J.A. 66 (1962), 200).</page><page sequence="11">James Wiseman 141 is a harmonious whole, is a highly complex artistic formula. It is so intricate, in fact, that only some basic aspects of it are as yet understood, and the Canon of the Argive Polykleitos, despite its widespread influence, remains largely a mystery. It is quite likely that it involved introducing intentional irregularities into the formulas to give those abstract creations more life. And the formal rendering of drapery, discussed so brilliantly by Car penter,14 involves intricate techniques intended not only to please the eye but to give the illusion of real drapery over a real body, though the drapery patterns cannot be duplicated with cloth. Architecture was just as complex and to labor the simplicity of the basic proportions of a temple is to miss the point. J. A. Bundgaard,15 who goes to great lengths to demote the Greek architect to the status of a general overseer of master stone ma sons, goes so far as to say that the Parthenon is no more compli cated in its structural principles than a five-aisled Danish barn. His comparison is as pointless as saying that the Iliad is basically no different from any other poem in dactylic hexameter. The Par thenon or any other work of art should be considered in all its aspects and as a whole. The subtleties of Periklean sacred archi tecture suggest creative minds with a liking for geometry and an audience on whom their genius was not wasted. The curving of the steps, stylobate, and entablature of a temple to impart life and bouyancy is no simple mason's task, but an artistic formula tion by and for a people so deeply concerned with man that they must make even the stones articulate. Their architecture was literally a living art; the orders and the proportions were only bases on which to raise animate buildings. They combined orders, altered proportions, inclined the walls and columns, diminished column diameter in an ellipse, etc., using complexity after com plexity which, taken separately, might be called an optical refine ment (but not "simple"!) or be said to serve this or that aesthetic effect. But the aim of them all, along with the sculptural embel lishment, the painting, the careful craftsmanship and planned approaches, was their combination into a harmonious composi tion. The goal is implicit in what they made and so is their success. The Athenian was not simple and neither was his art. That it should appear so is only a further indication of its intricate nature. Just as Perikles' funeral oration is a blend of what the Athenians were and what they would have liked to be but were not, so their art mixes formal techniques and profound subtleties to impart an illusion of casualness, of simplicity. And this is as it should be, for if art impresses one with the labor of its creation, one's eye is distracted from the art itself. Even in antiquity it was recognized that those finely formed marble and bronze athletes 14 Greek Sculpture (1960), 123-151. 15 Mnesicles ( 1957), esp. p. 96.</page><page sequence="12">142 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HUMANITIES were far more perfect than the subjects they represented. They were, in fact, almost indistinguishable from the statues of gods. We cannot help but wonder which concept (or longing) was more basic?anthropomorphic gods or "deified" mortals. These were, of course, not just artistic conventions. But these matters cannot be treated here. My intention is only to set out briefly a few ideas on some aspects of a study of the Periklean building program and to suggest that it would lead to a consideration of much more than form and function of buildings. There are several works, some already mentioned, that can serve as guides for such studies and the mention of a few of them should illustrate the types of publications I have had in mind when writing about a more humanistic archaeology. It is chiefly because of them that I find Carpenter's view of archaeology's status rather too pessimistic, and Carpenter's own contributions are among the most important. His Esthetic Basis of Greek Art and his recent Greek Art ( 1962) are both persuasive, interpretive studies. Even in Greek Sculpture, where he purports to view the subject as the "anonymous product of an impersonal craft," the reader is never allowed to forget that "art may be studied scien tifically but is never science, and that science cannot, fully and finally, explain art."16 George Mylonas is analytic and descriptive as well as creative and interpretive in Ancient Mycenae (1957) and Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries (1961). Similarly re markable for this combination of exact description and reasoned interpretation is Oscar Broneer's volume on the South Stoa at Corinth, the largest covered building in ancient Greece and the place where the city's most famous band of women may well have entertained.17 Morgan's controversial article on the sculptors of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia18 ends with a brief but valuable biographical study of Pheidias that is imaginative and spec ulative in the best sense. Leonard R. Palmer's Mycenaeans and Minoans ( 1961 ), though now shown by Mylonas to be incorrect in certain parts, and Emily Townsend Vermeule's discussion of the end of the Mycenaean civilization19 are important examina tions of antiquity based on material remains (lettered and un lettered). Finally, we should add that besides making human istic contributions, most of the books and articles cited here, along with others that could be listed, have also stimulated some excited protests and productive controversy. That only adds to their merit. 16 Greek Sculpture, 96. 17 Corinth I, iv: The South Stoa and Its Roman Successors ( 1954 ). is "Pheidias and Olympia," Hesperia 21 (1952), 295-339. 19 "The Fall of the Mycenaean Empire," Archaeology 13 (1960), 66-75.</page></plain_text>
