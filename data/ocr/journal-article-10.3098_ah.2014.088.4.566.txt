Barbed-wire poems, posters, trade cards, almanacs, and fliers constructed layers of meaning for the new fence. Barbed wire worked because it was dan- gerous, but only the earliest advertisements argued this directly. Instead, ad- vertisements targeted fears and sensibilities of the consuming public, promising to protect against marauding Indians, newly freed slaves, aes- thetes, and ballpark crashers. They advocated “American progress” and por- trayed an ordered and secured domestic landscape. And, of course, they promised to control horses, cattle, and sheep. The focus on barbed-wire ad- vertising affords a richly detailed look at beliefs and prejudices of Americans, at least as advertisers saw Americans, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

They went clothed in steel and equipped with sword and lance and battle-ax, and if they couldn’t persuade a person to try a sewing-machine on the installment plan, or a melodeon, or a barbed- wire fence . . . they removed him and passed on.1 What do advertisements mean? . . . They urge people to buy goods, but they also signify a certain vision of the good life; they validate a way of being in the world. They focus private fantasy; they sanction or subvert existing structures of economic and political power.2 in 1874 sEVErAL GroundBrEAkinG BArBEd-WirE patents were filed from dekalb, illinois, initiating a remarkable wave of manufacturing and sales of the new fence. just eight years later, a piece from denver’s Daily News laid out the conundrum posed by barbed wire: it would be a noble work if the [Humane society] could prevail upon the Leg- islature to pass a law prohibiting the erection of “barbed wire” fences. in this part of the country, and doubtless in other farming districts, a large majority of the fences around farms, pastures, etc., are built of “barbed wire,” which is strong, twisted wire, with sharp-pointed teeth or barbs wove [sic] in the wire three or four inches apart. scarcely a day passes but one can hear of the death or fatal injury of a cow, calf, horse or colt which has run into the fence (which cannot be seen far away), and so cuts its head and body as to result seriously and often fatally. . . . The foregoing is brought out by a sickening sight that met the eyes of passengers on the accommodation train between Collins and Love- land, yesterday morning. A herd of milk cows was feeding along the line of the railroad track, and as the train came rolling along a number of the cows started to cross the track. The engineer blew his whistle loud and shrill, and the fright- ened cows began to run in every direction. one unfortunate ran headlong into a wire fence near the track and jumped head and fore legs through the fence and there hung on the sharp barbs, and as the rear car passed by the passengers saw the brute hanging there on the sharp barbs kicking and bellowing, the piercing instruments sawing and cutting into her body deeper and deeper as she struggled for liberty. if the man who built the fence had a heart, not as hard as stone, and could have seen that terrible butchering, he would have solemnly sworn never again to build a barbed wire fence. For readers as yet unacquainted with the new fence, the reporter puts “barbed wire” in quotation marks and describes the strong, barbed, and twisted wire. Although the fence was relatively new, already “a large majority” of local fences were made of barbed wire, testimony to how much latent demand there 567 </page> <page sequence="3"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:57 AM  Page 102 Agricultural History Fall had been for such fencing and how quickly the demand had been supplied (railroad operators eager to prevent costly livestock deaths were among the early customers). unfortunately, as so luridly portrayed in the Daily News, the invention that solved the problem of how to fence vast stretches of the Amer- ican West was potentially dangerous. How then, knowing that barbed wire was efficient only because it was dangerous, and almost immediately under threat of legislative prohibition, did manufacturers advertise their product?3 When Henry Martin rose presented a sample of his latest attempt to “pre- vent stock from pushing against [fences]” at the 1873 dekalb, illinois, county fair, he may have hoped to influence the fencing industry, but he could not have imagined he was about to inspire a flood of inventions and an advertising blitz that would be an important part of an American mercantile revolution. By november 1874 three of the most influential new patents had been awarded to men who had examined rose’s invention at the 1873 county fair: jacob Haish, isaac Ellwood, and joseph Glidden, all residents of dekalb.4 Most scholarly work on the history of barbed wire has focused on the patent wars, on the burgeoning barbed-wire trade, on the details of western expansion enabled by barbed wire, and on the use of barbed wire in war. scholars have paid less attention to how inventors, manufacturers, and mar- keters of barbed wire were forced to confront the contradictory nature of this new fencing. Barbed wire was invented, as reviel netz writes, “to prevent the motion of cows; its function relied on violence; its success depended on deployment on a vast scale.” Before barbed wire could be widely deployed, however, before the owners of valued livestock would entrust their animals to a dangerous fence, backlash against its violence had to be addressed.5 The Washburn &amp; Moen Company defended its product in an 1881 state- ment to the new Hampshire legislature. Washburn &amp; Moen’s strongest counter-evidence to claims that the wire was dangerous was the rapid growth in demand for barbed wire among farmers and “herd-growers.” surely these users would repudiate fences that brought “peril and harm to their cherished animals.” The company argued further that cattle came to “speedily respect fence boundaries.” over the course of the seven years barbed wire had been manufactured, Washburn &amp; Moen claimed, not one member of the society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had registered a complaint against the use of barbed wire as a containment method.6 As the denver newspaper pointed out just a year later, however, the prob- lem remained, and barbed-wire companies worked to mollify legislators, jour- 568 </page> <page sequence="4"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:57 AM  Page 103 2014 Barbed and Dangerous nalists, and potential customers by modifying the physical form of the wire to mitigate its threat. But because the new fence was only effective when dan- gerous, and because none of the new patents were as efficient as the original ones, they also worked aggressively to mold the public’s image of barbed wire. To sell their wire, they did what advertisers have always done, appealing to the beliefs and desires and prejudices of potential buyers. specifically, adver- tisements played on racial and gender prejudices, appealed to beliefs like Man- ifest destiny, employed religious symbols and animal images, contrasted civilized German-American industry with indian savagery, and invoked a re- assuring domesticity. The visual and verbal images with which barbed wire was sold in the final quarter of the nineteenth century tell a very interesting story about the wire and about the Americans who bought and sold it.7 Barbed-wire advertising in the last decades of the nineteenth century took place in the context of newly opened national markets, of newly available manufactured goods, and of new modes of advertising. “Between 1870 and 1900,” robert jay writes, “the volume of American advertising increased by more than tenfold.” Along with the increased volume came new methods of advertising. The russian populist Aleksandr Herzen claimed in 1855 that im- presario P. T. Barnum “understood the great secret of the age of rhetoric, the age of effects and phrases, exhibitions and advertisements; he comprehended that the most important thing for the contemporary nominalist is the poster!” After Barnum’s success, Pamela Walker Laird notes, “‘to bill it like a circus’ became a common expression among aggressive advertisers.” And, as Cary nelson and Michael Chasar point out, between 1860 and 1920 advertising be- came a coherent industry in the united states, involving a wide-scale corpo- ratization that brought advertising into most Americans’ daily lives. As the Mark Twain epigraph at the beginning manifests, barbed wire was one of the manufactured products sold through aggressive methods.8 As underdog in the struggles for barbed-wire patent legitimacy, inventor and manufacturer Haish employed what he described as new tactics “of a guer- rilla order, very spectacular in many respects, yet catchy in their make-up.” Most prominent in Haish’s guerrilla arsenal was his Barb Fence Regulator, a sort of almanac that grew from eight pages to sixteen and that appeared annu- ally for more than a decade. numbers printed in successive issues proclaim that the Regulator was distributed (largely through wholesalers who stamped their company information in blank spaces left on the back covers) in numbers adding up to five hundred thousand copies by 1887. Haish boasted about the 569 </page> <page sequence="5"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:57 AM  Page 104 Agricultural History Fall role his Regulator played in an advertising revolution: “nothing like it had ever before appeared in print, quotations from celebrated authors, caricatures and cartoons of the most grotesque character, poetry . . . yet appealing to the sensibilities and the risibilities of the general public.” Haish also claimed that “while my opponents knew well how to take care of the legal end, they were entirely at sea when they sought to catch public opinion, a new era in adver- tising had dawned which carried them off their feet.” just what the sensibilities and risibilities were to which Haish and others appealed becomes evident through an examination of the manifold, creative, and sometimes shocking advertising for the new wire in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.9 in 1878, only four years after the key patents were issued, manufacturers Ellwood and Washburn &amp; Moen published A Book for the Farmer, the Gar- dener and the Country Gentleman that heralded “The utility, Efficiency and Economy of Barb Fence.” Along with illustrations of the fence that “protects the most tempting Crops from the most unruly Cattle,” and in addition to com- parisons of the cost of various styles of fence, the booklet cited press reports that the barb fence, “while four years ago as little known as was the telephone in the time of king Pharaoh, is to-day actually in use to the extent in weight of eight thousand tons, or more than fifty thousand miles in length!” Twenty- nine pages of testimonials from illinois to California and Michigan to Texas indicated how far the new wire had already spread, echoed some of the lan- guage of the patents, and gave a sense of how the wire had been advertised and received. For instance, s. A. Barker wrote in 1876 from California that  my field was surrounded by large bands of wild cattle and horses, which broke through the plain wire repeatedly, but when i constructed a strong fence in place of the plain wire, they have failed to get into the field. i consider it one-third the cheapest and much the best material for fencing i have ever seen. it is a terror to horses and cattle.  C. W. and A. H. johnson argued in 1876 also from California, that the Glidden fence worked equally well against strong-willed cattle and trespassing indians:  Two strands of wire on a ditch, effectually turns breachy cattle that have been bothering for eight or ten years. now we can go to bed at night and rest con- tented about our crops, and our stock not being stolen. The indians have bothered us a great deal, in cutting our fences, and going through on horseback, letting our stock out, and outside stock in the ranch. since we put up the wire they have not bothered any. 570 </page> <page sequence="6"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 105 2014 Barbed and Dangerous stephen Prestegad commented hyperbolically from illinois that, “it will stop anything in the shape of stock, from a grasshopper to an elephant.” The un- abashed use of the word “terror” in this booklet indicates that serious backlash against the dangerous barbs had yet to surface. native Americans appeared, as they would in later advertising, as undesirables who were best fenced out. And the exotic animals invoked by these users of the Washburn &amp; Moen fence to emphasize its potency would quickly populate new advertisements.10 Because barbed wire was viewed primarily as a way to control animals, because valued livestock risked injury from the wire, and because, as jackson Lears notes, advertising at this time often used anthropomorphic animals, it is not surprising that animals offering testimonials on the efficacy of barbed- wire fencing appeared in the industry’s very first flier, Glidden’s “Farmers! Take notice.” By emphasizing the fierceness of the bulls, and by having these powerful animals voice their inability to penetrate the fence, the flier sug- gested to readers that Glidden’s barbed wire was a highly effective restraint. As sensibilities about the nature of barbed wire changed, however, it was nec- essary to draw imagined testimony from animals aware that while the fence controlled their movement, it did so benignly.11 one of the more elaborate advertisements employing talking animals is a folding trade card for Crandal Manufacturing (see Figure 1). The card presents the ribbon-like “Champion Barbed-Wire” fence developed to overcome barbed wire’s visibility problems. Behind the fence stand a multitude of barn- yard animals. The dog laments his obsolescence, as he is no longer needed to take care of the sheep, which wisely will not cross the fence. The horse’s mea culpa is related to the visibility of Champion barbed wire: “i will be to blame if i get hurt on this barbed wire.” And the cow has a plan of action: “i am going down to no. 76 Michigan st., Chicago, and request them to take off some of these barbs so i can get through.” There are, then, two strands of meaning in the Champion advertisement: the wire is safely visible and the wire is dangerous. When the animals controlled by barbed wire give voice to- commonsense logic about its ability to control without harm, whom can con- tradict them?12 Haish’s early advertising often featured a bellicose fighting cock. in the 1881 Regulator, for instance, the “s”-Barb cock stands triumphant over the cocks that represent the patents of barbed-wire manufacturers Glidden, kelly, and Hunt (see Figure 2). ironically, before the Regulator could go to print with this image, the ongoing patent litigation depicted as a cockfight was decided 571 </page> <page sequence="7"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 106 Agricultural History Fall 572 Figure 1.

Haish includes both the original and an altered image on the same page of the Regulator and explains that he was forced to change the names on the cocks, leaving the kelly and Glidden patents triumphant and his own patent dead in the right foreground. still, the caption to the doctored image reads (in the German-inflected language Haish repeatedly featured in his advertise- ments): “But dot ‘s’ Barb steel Fence Wire is the Boss all the same.”13 Figure 2. Glidden, kelly, and Hunt “s”-Barb Cock. sourCE: Barb Fence Regulator, dekalb, 1881. A Haish trade card also casts the cock in an aggressive role, but this time it is not a patent that suffers. The rooster on the EurEkA side of the card is the “early bird” that has, as the proverb goes, captured the “worm” and is now flailing around excitedly. The fence is made of boards, and this is the “Eureka” moment when the farmer who would have noticed the hungry rooster if the fence he was peeing through had been made of barbed wire realizes he needs another kind of fence (see Figure 3). And if a reader thinks the picture is in anyway untoward, the trade card turns the judgment back onto the reader: Honi soi qui mal y pense (shame on him who thinks evil). That is not the end of the story, however; the early bird can be controlled and even made useful. The illustration on the card’s reverse shows the renegade rooster now under 573 </page> <page sequence="9"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 108 Agricultural History Fall the firm control barbed-wire reins, controlled easily even by a prim and proper woman, the cock speeds to deliver the “s” Barb wire, stretchers, and staples “right on time,” ensuring that no lascivious accidents like the one on the other side will occur (see Figure 4). in tandem, the two images on this trade card lay out the basic problem: barbed wire may be a little dangerous, but it is cer- tainly dangerous to be without barbed wire.14 Figure 3. Eureka! sourCE: Haish, “Eureka!” trade card, dekalb, nd, HC. Another of Haish’s 1880s advertisements likewise features a fighting cock, a magnificent “‘s’-Barb rooster” or “Cock of the Walk” kept in check by barbed-wire reins in the hand of its portly, gentleman rider (see Figure 5). The bird is powerful and threatening with its spurred, twisted-wire legs, assuring the prospective buyer that this fence is dangerous enough to do its job. And yet, even a pipe-smoking gentleman can control it, especially when aided by barbed-wire reins and a barbed-wire quirt. of course the wire is threatening, but it serves, at least in the visual logic of this image, as its own restraint. A fascinating set of animals appears in an image Haish used in multiple is- sues of the Regulator and in fliers as well. The scene is a rural farm neatly or- dered by barbed-wire fences. A train circles around from a factory on the hill overlooking the prosperous farm. A portly, pipe-smoking man (the same man riding the rooster in Figure 5) drives the train, wielding barbed-wire reins and a whip to urge on a pair of tigers and a pair of lions. it is “Haish’s Trans-Con- tinental Through Train” and, depending on which version of the image is used as the years pass, it has transported ten thousand or thirty thousand or some other number of spools of barbed wire across the globe. The tigers and lions 574 </page> <page sequence="10"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 109 2014 Barbed and Dangerous Figure 4. right on Time! sourCE: Haish, “right on Time!” trade card, dekalb, nd, HC. are joined by a bear standing next to a barbed-wire-wrapped tree, by four pipe- smoking dogs sitting on spools of barbed wire, and by an eagle that perches on a tight strand of barbed wire above a portrait of Haish.15 so what does this all mean? Haish’s lions and tigers make sense in the con- text of Lears’s argument that “late-nineteenth-century advertising . . . sought both to tame the beast within and tap its vital powers . . . [celebrating] self- control even as it revealed a powerful fascination with the exotic and the prim- itive.” in Haish’s advertisement, the dangerous, exotic beasts are tightly controlled by barbed-wire reins. And should the frisson of wildness threaten to overwhelm a viewer, she can shift her gaze to the soothing prospect of highly civilized pipe-smoking dogs. An eagle and a bear add fierce yet familiar local accents to this ongoing dialectic. in short, the Haish flier presents a ver- itable transcontinental circus under whose tent the viewer witnessed barbed wire as a spectacular synthesis of the savage and the tame, the exotic and the familiar, the wild and the civilized.16 Purveyors of the Glidden fence were quick to “bill it like a circus”—liter- ally. domestic animals easily jump or crawl under or over or through various types of fences as they circle the ring (see Figure 6). But when they approach the Glidden barbed fence, the horses and cows give way to a lion, an elephant, and a kangaroo that have been thrown into commotion by a fence even they can not jump  or  break  through. However dangerous, however exotic the an- imal, barbed wire is the master of them all. As the old order (in which animals  575 </page> <page sequence="11"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 110 Agricultural History Fall find their ways through all manner of fences) is abruptly interrupted, the rev- olutionary new fence causes such a commotion that some members of the au- dience flee the tent. This is a terrifying, if ultimately welcome, new order of things. Controlling animals, however, was not barbed wire’s only function. The new fence, like the telegraph, the railroad, and many other inventions, helped drive what was popularly seen as “American progress.”17 in Advertising Progress, Laird writes that “manufacturers . . . boasted of their roles in progress through advertising messages that glorified industry and technology as the means to new abundance and cultural advancement.” A well-known Glidden flier did just that with three railroad trains backed by a smoke-belching manufacturing plant. use of the railroad locomotive in ad- vertising, Laird argues, is an evocation of the technological sublime, exactly the symbolism that informs both Glidden’s advertisement and Haish’s “transcontinental through-train.” While evoking the power of the locomotive, barbed-wire manufacturers also pointed to their product stretched along the railroad tracks as part and parcel of progress through technology. Progress, however, especially progress that involves controlling the movement of ani- mals, quickly became progress involving the control of human beings.18 Figure 5. The Civilizing Effects of Barbed Wire. sourCE: regional History Center/university Archives, northern illinois university Libraries, dekalb, ill. 576 </page> <page sequence="12"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 111 2014 Barbed and Dangerous An early Washburn &amp; Moen pamphlet made the first gesture in that direc- tion when it advertised Barb Fence Armor. “Growing out of the Barb Fence is the Barb Fence Armor,” the text reads, “intended more especially for the older states, where wooden fences are common.” The “convolved circles of steel Barb Fencing” create a “fence absolutely impassable by man or beast.” An accompanying etching depicts “A Ball Ground enclosed with ‘Barb Armed’ Fence,” and the president of the Boston Base Ball Association added a testi- monial dated september 1, 1876 to the effect that five hundred feet of the armor “saved us, the afternoon of the first day it was put on, fifty dollars ($50) in special police, and from $400 to $500 admission fees.” Control of human beings may have been advantageous for the Base Ball Association, but other kinds of control arose in those early decades that were much less benign.19 Most notably, barbed wire enabled conquest, control, and exploitation of a vast region occupied by native Americans. Advertisers were quick to exploit this aspect of their product. The flier whose rooster was discussed above may be Haish’s most striking and most troubling image in this context. Haish’s ubiquitous German American, this time astride the double-spurred rooster, is master of the  scene  (see Figure 5).  in the background,  under  the  rooster’s Figure 6.

To the right, disappearing into the background, are bison and a wagon train. Aided by Haish’s barbed wire, the “civilized” EuroAmericans standing at both ends of the fence are destined, the image suggests, to conquer and to civilize. Haish’s advertisement pushes the concept of progress through industry to its utopian (or dystopian) extreme. The natives and the bison will be overcome by colonial power derived from the invention, manufacture, and deployment of barbed wire. “Civilization” moves forward, the “uncivilized” are forced out, and the driving mechanism is barbed wire.20 The general thrust of Haish’s fantastic flier would have felt familiar to many Americans. john Gast’s 1872 “American Progress,” painted just two years before the dekalb patents, likewise depicted the divinely sanctioned displacement of native Americans by EuroAmericans and their technologies. in Gast’s image, the unenlightened indians are driven into the western dark- ness by plow-wielding settlers, by an allegorical beauty trailing telegraph wire, and by three trains bringing goods from a busy harbor. Had barbed wire been manufactured in quantity a couple of years earlier, the painting would certainly have included that technology as well. The image of the unenlightened savage common to the Haish poster and the Gast painting was widespread. Glidden salesman Henry sanborn, for in- stance, planned to make his Texas ranch into a proving ground for barbed- wire fences, choosing for the test a “kind of twilight zone with the light of civilization behind it, and the darkness of savagery before.” Barbed wire was dangerous, as it had to be to control “savage” indians. nonetheless, as the real indian threat subsided, the one dangerous entity came to represent the other, as in a Waukegan advertisement where the wild native, the fictional Chief Waukegan, was reduced, like the fighting cock, to a symbol of strength and ferocity that controlled whatever needed to be controlled.21 olivier razac argues that barbed wire “created the conditions for the phys- ical and cultural disappearance of the indian.” And as indians lost their lands and nomadic cultures to the stringers of barbed wire, EuroAmericans who had displaced them rushed to document their “demise.” joseph dixon, funded by the Wanamaker family, took hundreds of photographs of native Americans to capture traces of what he saw as a “vanishing race.” it was a difficult task. Barbed wire, for instance, now inhabited the same landscape as the native American, as evidenced in the photograph “native Americans on Horses” (see Figure 7). The barbed wire can be seen shining in a good reproduction, as can 578 </page> <page sequence="14"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 113 2014 Barbed and Dangerous Figure 7. native Americans on Horses. sourCE: joseph dixon, “native Americans on Horses,” photograph, Wanamaker Expedition 1908–1913, Western History/Genealogy department, denver Public Library, denver, Colo. a somewhat clumsy attempt to scratch the fence posts off the negative. it is difficult to feel good lamenting the passing of the romanticized indians when confronted with the instrument of their supposed demise.22 Haish’s colonizing cock promised control of native Americans, and there were other groups targeted for control by barbed-wire advertisers as well. in the 1885 Glidden Barb-Fence Journal, for instance, a cartoon played on post– Civil War anxieties aroused by freed slaves. Barbed wire has foiled a theft, for no man or beast (and in this racist image the distinction is not great) would dare cross the Glidden fence. The African American man kneeling outside a watermelon patch surrounded by barbed-wire fencing is the stereotypical sub- ordinate sambo figure (see Figure 8). The cartoon’s “peek-a-boo” caption is an enigma, unless the point is that along with its threatening barbs, the barbed wire is watchful. The Glidden Journal also asserted that its fence was perfect in every way, including as an instrument of surveillance: “it watches with argus eyes the inside and outside, up, down and lengthwise; it prevents the ‘ins’ from being ‘outs’; and the ‘outs’ from being ‘ins’; watches at day-break, at noontide, at sunset and all night long.” This poetic declaration touches on two important related themes: the fencing in of the same and the fencing out of the other and the conversion of the barbs into ever-watching eyes, hundreds of them as in the mythological giant Argus, watching in all directions at all times.23 579 </page> <page sequence="15"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 114 Agricultural History Fall Figure 8. Peek-A-Boo. sourCE: Glidden Barb-Fence Journal, 1885. in addition to the racist cartoon in which barbed wire watches and controls the ex-slave, racist jokes pepper the Journal and Regulator alike. Haish’s 1881 Regulator, for instance, recounts a story from the Atlanta Constitution about uncle remus that has him explaining to a black boy with a book and to a po-  liceman acquaintance that education is bad for the boy: “Put a spellin’ book in a nigger’s hands, en right den en dar’ you loozes a plow hand.” The joke keeps the black boy in his place, as will, by implication, the new fence. What- ever anxieties remained after the slaves had been freed, after what was kept in had been let out, Glidden and Haish claimed that their barbed wire had the ability to reestablish order, to re-regulate society.24 The 1879 Regulator included a cartoon with an only slightly more nuanced message. sambo sits inside a fence surrounding a haystack. outside stand a jackass and a salesman in a suit carrying a briefcase. sambo speaks first:  it’s no use talkin’ ‘bout yer Mernopoly Barb and Broad Claim; it’s dun gone and busted!

The Haish cartoon established a demeaning hierarchy, using its racial stereo- types to skewer the monopolists who were the butt of even sambo’s joke. Lears puts this kind of advertising in the context of a public uncertain of its own identity in a new commercial era: “all the fears of hypocrisy, all the sus- picions that the successful man was merely a clever manipulator of appear- ances, could be projected outside Anglo-saxon culture onto the shiftless sambo, the indian-giver, the wheedling semite.”25 A whole set of advertisements for barbed wire exploited racist sentiments against native and African Americans, raising fears and then supplying pro- tection against what comes to be feared. Advertisers were quick to pillory other groups against which they could assume the buyers of their wire were prejudiced (including Harvard students). “A dudelet,” for instance, the poem directly under the “peek-a-boo” cartoon in the Journal, plays on a prejudice against “dudes,” or aesthetes like oscar Wilde, who toured America in 1882.

They could act on those prejudices, Haish and Glidden proposed, by buying the wire that was “death on” anyone not their own kind (fellow members of the benevolent and vicious order of the erectors of fences). Barbed wire’s ability to control errant (by whatever standard) human behavior resulted, then, in standard themes em- ployed by advertisers—black thief, savage indian, gorgeous aesthete—what- ever the threat, barbed wire was the solution. And where solutions were so absolute, a turn to religion was inevitable.26 Haish’s 1877 Regulator featured a vivid image of a horned “Father of Lies” with the “Broad Claim” rising from his back pocket and Glidden’s much touted “bevel cut” stamped on his cloven foot. Frustrated after the 1880 court decision in favor of Glidden’s claim to a broad, previous patent and against his own patent, Haish began the 1881 issue of the Regulator with a paean to God-fearing dealers and consumers, to “men whose convictions of right and wrong are based upon . . . an All-wise and truth loving God, who will bring to naught all the wicked machinations of Godless monopolists and their bull- dozing allies.”27 Besides these direct attacks on competitors as Godless devils, Haish also employed religion to sell his wire, proclaiming in the 1877 Regulator that his invention was the “Pioneer, Light-weight Wire of the universe, also for the promulgation of the true creed of Barb Wire Gospel, stamped with the sanction and authority of the wisest and best throughout the civilized world.” The same issue of the Regulator contained what was essentially a sermon, but at the end, instead of the expected evocation of a powerful jesus to bring surcease from the cares of the world, the sermon took an unexpected twist:  The weary world has need of rest. it seethes and boils like the witch’s cauldron. . . . What means this unrest; this fever heat? . . . Who is the physician able to . . . effect a certain cure . . . ? The cure is simple; it is within the reach of all . . . : Buy the celebrated Enamel ‘s’ Barb steel Fence Wire, manufactured only by jacob Haish. Haish thus took a sacred motif that might be seen as off-limits to commerce and, tongue in cheek, inserted his fence in the place of God. in her essay “Ad- vertising—sacred and Profane,” Marghanita Laski suggested that this is a treacherous choice. Potential consumers of the product might react badly to barbed-wire invasion of their sacred rhetorical space. roland Marchand con- 582 </page> <page sequence="18"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 117 2014 Barbed and Dangerous tinues Laski’s argument: “To shout ‘Be patriotic; buy my product,’ or ‘Expe- rience the sublime rapture of owning a product illuminated by God’s holy light; send your money today,’ would embarrass any respectable advertiser.” it obviously did not embarrass Haish, who calculated that his folksy humor would be seen as hyperbole to be chuckled about.28 The salvific nature of barbed wire is reiterated in one of Haish’s early trade cards: “Forbidden Fruit. Can’t get through Haish’s ‘s’ Barb Fence.” standing in a proverbial Garden of Eden, a young woman picks fruit, gathering what she picks in her upraised dress as animals graze peaceably around her. in the lane on the other side of the barbed-wire fence stand two men who have tried to reach the forbidden fruit (the girl? the apples?). A third man has turned to run. The awkward stances, the possibly injured hands, and the man’s flight indicate that the attempt to transgress the commandment has been duly pun- ished. Adam and Eve may have eaten the “forbidden fruit,” but that was before the deployment of barbed wire. Haish tweaks the familiar Biblical story, count- ing on his hardware-store audience to understand that while he is not Godless, neither is he straightlaced. in stark contrast to the sweet girl picking apples are the fence barbs, so exaggerated in the engraving that the bucolic scene takes on a threatening air. Who would want to live in the midst of so much dangerous wire? But then again, who would not want to live in a peaceable kingdom safe from transgressors? Yes, barbed wire is dangerous, and because it is dangerous, it protects the innocents. A good many advertisements played on this theme of security for home and family, of peace and prosperity for all.29 The letter introducing the 1887 Regulator ends with a tongue-in-cheek “regulatory” forecast of the eclipses expected for the year: “We have also un- dertaken to regulate the Eclipses in 1887 as well as some other matters, and the following [a schedule of eclipses] is the true and correct style of eclipse which will be right on time as predicted. Yours Astronomically, j. Haish &amp; Co.” if Haish’s barbed wire can promise order—true and correct order in the universe—then surely a smaller matter such as providing domestic security will be an easy task. This principle is even manifest in the typeface on the cover. The font for “rEGuLATor” is generally rounded, while the font for “The BArB FEnCE” is pointedly sharp. The engraver thus presents both dan- gerous and benign signifiers, indicating that Haish’s “s”-Barb is just danger- ous enough to produce comfortable security for families and homes.30 A particularly savory version of German American domesticity was prom- 583 </page> <page sequence="19"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 118 Agricultural History Fall ised by an image that recurred in Haish’s Regulator and his fliers alike (see Figure 9). stringing the dangerous wire is easy enough to allow conversation about a good German lunch and joking about jimmy who pulls at the beer keg on Vati’s back while the supremely domestic couple goes about its pleasant work: der bologna are quite handy, der kraut ish ready too; shust draw your Haish’s Lager, While i drive der staple through. As noted earlier, Haish, himself a German immigrant, often featured this ge- nial German as the embodiment of domestic prosperity secured by the admit- tedly dangerous wire. Accompanied at times by a little dog, wearing wooden shoes, a floppy cap, and smoking a pipe, the comfortably civilized German American wears a barbed-wire ring, carries a barbed-wire walking stick, and stretches barbed wire as nonchalantly as can be. What’s to be afraid of? This man and his product will regulate your life, providing prosperity and domestic security in a context of beery humor.31 Like the Regulator cover, the front cover of the 1885 Glidden Barb-Fence Journal depicts a peaceful rural scene both surrounded and divided by barbed- wire fences. neighboring farms are separated by barbed wire; each of the homes is encompassed by barbed wire; the railroad right-of-way is fenced on either side to protect travelers and animals alike. The impression is of order- liness, tranquility, security, and prosperity. What should be in is in, and what should be out is out. Animals stand or lie peacefully behind barbed-wire fences, apparently familiar with the consequences of confronting the barbed wire. Protected by barbs, the humans inside the fence are snug, secure, their peace and tranquility assured.32 in this vein, the Pacific steel &amp; Wire Company’s 1897 wire fencing circular advertises domestic applications for animals and humans alike (see Figure 10). The front cover includes typical farm animals to be fenced in, in this case a sow lying contently as she suckles her litter within the confines of a wire fence. To the right of the sow and piglets, a parallel human scenario is de- picted. Barely visible through tall trees stands a stately Victorian home. in front of this home, a woman reclines in a chair with book in hand as two of her offspring play ball at her feet. Like the sow and her litter, this mother, her children, and their domicile are securely and protectively  fenced in.

While these stories have no reference to barbed wire other than the fact that they appear in barbed-wire journals, they place women on pedestals, explicitly compare them with draft animals, and so glorify them that good farmers reading the almanacs might well be prompted to buy barbed wire to protect their women as well as their prize pigs.33 Each advertisement shares the precarious dialectical message required of all barbed-wire advertising: this wire, this sharply barbed wire, this very ef- fective wire, may seem dangerous but in effect it is benign. inventors, manu- facturers, and advertisers alike continually negotiated a delicate balance as to the form and the meaning of barbed wire. if exponentially rising barbed-wire sales in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are any indication, they were extremely successful in that negotiation.34 When Mark Twain satirized the state of nineteenth-century civilization through a Connecticut Yankee who figures that if knights can sell enough sewing machines and barbed-wire fences they will improve the lives of a be- nighted medieval populace, he knew that his 1889 readers were familiar with those very claims. He and his fellow Americans had been inundated with barbed-wire advertising that promised them, paradoxically, more civilized lives through the use of a savage wire. But when barbed wire, the agricultural tool, began to be used in warfare as Twain predicted, it took on new levels of meaning. Late in A Connecticut Yankee, Hank’s civilizing endeavors are 586 </page> <page sequence="22"> 88,4_composite_Journal Test  9/16/14  10:58 AM  Page 121 2014 Barbed and Dangerous threatened, and he turns to electrified wire (Twain originally intended this to be electrified barbed wire). The scene is horrific, prophetic of World War i trench warfare dominated by barbed wire (which slowed down advances) and the machine gun (which could kill troops struggling through the barbed wire more efficiently than rifles): Yes, it was a man-—a dim great figure in armor, standing erect, with both hands on the upper wire-—and of course there was a smell of burning flesh. . . . We counted fifteen of those pathetic statues-—dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire. . . . The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand.  The moment barbed wire was invented its use in controlling more than live- stock was inevitable. Twain’s intuitions about barbed wire became reality in the concentration camps of the Boer War, in the trenches of World War i, andn the extermination camps of the Holocaust.  dekalb folklore suggests that jacob Haish, who was still manufacturing barbed wire in dekalb when the First World War began, appalled by the human cost, refused to sell his wire for use in the war and closed down all production in 1916.35 NOTES 1.

(hereafter HC). despite Wash- burn and Moen’s efforts, stories about the vicious nature of barbed wire continued to circulate, coming to a head in the early 1880s.  7. The first indications of contradictory meaning appear in barbed-wire patents. From 1867 to 1875 thirty-five barbed-fence patents were issued in the united states. of these, twenty-one (60 percent) contained words such as “prick,” “repel,” and “deter,” language that promised potential harm or injury. Later patents eschewed such terms. richard ohmann points out that an American mass culture was established through ad- vertising at this time. As advertisers constructed the meanings of their products, they were simultaneously constructing the lives of their customers. He argues that advertising mirrored consumer desires and beliefs. Laird disagrees, claiming that we have little access to informa- tion on consumer responses and must withhold judgment. While Laird’s caution is important to bear in mind, we assume that advertising was effective because it accurately assessed atti- tudes of the customers who bought barbed wire in such quantities. see, ohmann, Selling Cul- ture: Magazines, Markets, and Class at the Turn of the Century (new York: Verso, 1996), 11–29; Laird, Advertising Progress: American Business and the Rise of Consumer Marketing (Baltimore: johns Hopkins university Press, 1998), 462–63. 8. robert jay, The Trade Card in Nineteenth-Century America (Columbia: university of Missouri Press, 1987), 34; Lears, Fables of Abundance, 54; Laird, Advertising Progress, 44; Cary nelson and Michael Chasar, “American Advertising: A Poem for Every Product," in The Oxford History of Popular Print Culture, Volume Six, ed.
