<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTER- PRETATION OF SCIENCE WALDO E. HAISLEY Scientists And Scientific Knowledge civilization relies heavily on modern sci- ence for its beliefs and practice, contributing in return sub- stantial support to both pure and applied science. The responsi- bilities of twentieth-century scientists in this interaction imply obligations to politics, technology, and the academic reservoir of established knowledge, including among the last of these some participation in the continuous public debate and philosophical discussion which attempts to define the nature of scientific truth. Physics, one of the older and better-established scientific dis- ciplines, often serves as a paradigm science and therefore has a special concern with this responsibility. But physicists and other natural scientists are often uncomfortable in the presence of phil- osophical discourse, not only because their formal training has included little of the subject but also because so much of the content of contemporary analytical philosophy seems totally ir- relevant to their professional concerns and so much of current philosophical discussion at the periphery of physics is disappoint- ingly inconclusive. Within the traditions of modern science, more- over, lies a deep-set antiphilosophical bias and the claim that philosphy can be explained away or safely ignored. While the grounds for this claim are neither trivial nor readily dismissable as mere professional narrowness or preoccupation, there does lie within the same tradition a considerable amount of distinguished and thoughtful writing in which scientists have attempted to interpret to themselves and others the nature of Mr. Haisley is an associate professor of physics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He teaches, among other things, a course for science majors in the history and philosophy of physical science. 60</page><page sequence="2">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 61 their enterprise.* Indeed, professional scientists are perennially drawn into such discussion, whether reluctantly, under pressure to speak up, or willingly, in response to the seductive tug of personal interest and concern. And whether they engage in phil- osophical discussion or not, scientists must necessarily have some beliefs, however rudimentary and tacitly held, about the nature of scientific knowledge. The present paper is a critical review of certain philosophical tenets widely held today by scientists and others about the nature of physical science; namely, those underlying the so-called "opera- tionalist" position. This view of scientific knowledge, which owes its name and much of its widespread dissemination in this country to the formulations in 1927 (R5)1" of the American physicist P. W. Bridgman, has been strongly reinforced by its apparent indissociability from modern developments in theoretical physics - namely, relativity and quantum mechanics. Indeed, some phy- sicists would maintain that these developments, and the inter- pretations associated with them, dictate its acceptance as the only philosophical position in harmony with the factual findings of physics. As a philosophy of science, operationalism is only one modern variant in a family of doctrines much broader in scope and earlier in origin than modern physical science, and the contem- porary acceptance of these doctrines is more extensive than the community of physics and other physical science. Science, how- ever, has played a central role in this complex of ideas; its modern development, for instance, has figured importantly in shaping them and providing them with prestigious support. In turn, the general intellectual climate they represent has helped form the attitudes and philosophical opinions of modern scientists. Thus the pragmatism of William James, the instrumentalism of John Dewey, the behaviorism of J. B. Watson and B. F. Skinner, and the logical positivism of Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle are all rooted in the same way of looking at the world as that which fostered Bridgman's operationalism and facilitated its general acceptance. Bridgman himself implicitly acknowledged a debt * The writings of such modern figures as Mach, Einstein, Bridgman, Bohr, Margenau, and R. B. Lindsay come immediately to mind. The list could be copiously amplified. t See References at conclusion of essay, p. 82.</page><page sequence="3">62 SOUNDINGS to the positivisitic phenomenalism of the nineteenth-century phy- sicist-philospher Ernst Mach (R5, pp. v, 183), as have many other modern scientists. The instrumentalist interpretation of science* has thus had many variants. A somewhat simplified example may be taken from a textbook, written some years ago, for intermediate stu- dents of nuclear physics: It is commonly held by other philosophies that the universe is a vast reservoir of truths and that it is the function of the scientist to uncover these truths. A logical positivist, however, sees no opera- tional way to decide whether a given theory or hypothesis repre- sents "absolute truth" or not. As a result he discards all concepts like "truth" or "reality" in his thinking. His goal is to give as eco- nomical a description as possible of the sense perceptions that come (or that can be made to come) within his experience. We marvel at the economy that is possible; many scientists identify "reality" with this economy.1 A more comprehensive expository example of this approach to scientific knowledge is an article (R26) contributed by a con- temporary philosopher to a professional journal of physics. Its central point may be summed up in one provocative statement by the author, Professor Paul F. Schmidt, that ' 'physicists will have to give up the notion that they are hunting for the truth. It's another ghost to be forgotten" (p. 30). A basic theme in the modern instrumentalist position is profound skepticism toward or outright rejection of the essential knowability of a natural physical world, independent of the experience of the observer.2 Such a position, like the solipsistic skepticism often attributed (unjustly) to Bishop Berkeley, is shocking to common sense. Although it is not therefore false and although there are many cogent reasons for its widespread official acceptance, one has the impression that in practice scientists do not at heart take it too seriously. This very fact, if true, poses a contradiction between professed belief and observed practice which may be symptomatic of trouble and in any case provides grounds for reconsideration. Indeed, though common sense has often turned out to be * This broader designation follows the usage of Karl Popper (e.g., in R25) and many of the followers of John Dewey. The term "scientific posi- tivism" will also be used in this paper to denote instrumentalist or positivist doctrines as they have developed internally among scientists and the spe- cifically science-minded.</page><page sequence="4">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 63 wrong, its suggestive promptings have also provided useful reme- dies for the sophistry which is an abiding hazard in the logical constructions of abstract thought. And somehow one suspects that in spite of apparent difficulties, currently unresolved questions in theoretical physics, and the admittedly fictitious or noncom- mital character of many models and constructs which have never- theless proved fruitful in scientific work, common sense is a trust- worthy guide here. It is difficult to resist the conviction that scientists have all along been engaged in the enterprise of knowing and understanding an external physical universe, whose existence is independent of and frequently recalcitrant to their efforts but which they have in some measure succeeded in comprehend- ing. We will contend that this common-sense conviction is indeed justified and that scientific knowledge is more than mere manip- ulative know-how. We will claim that the modern instrumen- talist trend is in fact a cul-de-sac, leading to insupportable con- tradictions, and that it derives not from a progressive purification of scientific method, as its adherents have sometimes stated, but rather from the hardening of earlier and outmoded ideological positions arising out of the Copernican-Newtonian revolution (attractive for their forensic and political efficacy but essentially only half-truths), combined with a preoccupation among working scientists which has facilitated the apotheosis of methodological maxims as philosophical gospel. We will conclude by suggesting lines (already evident in contemporary thought) along which a "return to realism/' moving toward a sounder and more satis- fying position, might well proceed. The Common-Sense Interpretation: Scientific Inquiry as a Cumulative Process of Discovery Science has often been characterized as an extension of com- mon sense, and the common-sense interpretation we now wish to contrast with the instrumentalist interpretation previously de- scribed may be broadly characterized as a "realist" position. It is the explicit view of most non-academic laymen and, even today, of many working scientists. A realist tends to regard science as an accumulated body of knowledge about the physical universe, most (though not all) of which is dependably final. In this view, scientific knowledge is the culmination of many</page><page sequence="5">64 SOUNDINGS centuries of scientific discovery. While in a sense this process of discovery dates from the dawn of civilization, it is customary to regard the modern rational scientific tradition as dating from the inception of classical Greek science. Some current knowledge (e.g., Archimedes' principle of hydrostatics, the equal-angle law of optical reflection, and the spherical shape of the earth) has survived without essential modification since that early period, while other contemporary knowledge (e.g., the nuclear atom, the electronic character of electrical conduction, and the phe- nomenology and parametric characterization of the electromag- netic spectrum) is of much more recent origin. Most of those involved in physical science are aware of current advances in the discovery process which can be expected to extend the limits of present knowledge still further. We believe we know collect- ively a great deal more about the physical world than did the Greeks, and that much of our knowledge has a permanent char- acter which supports the expectation that it will stand (doubt- less with modifications and refinements) for the duration of civilization. If we are honest with ourselves, we will admit that we think so because we are also convinced, despite occasional doubts, that many of our scientific beliefs (our general notions, for instance, about the role played by atoms, protons, neutrons, and electrons in relation to the macroscopic properties of the chemical elements) represent "the way things really are." This process of discovery has been cumulative, in the sense that some discoveries provide the basis for others; thus a knowl- edge of the properties and nature of electromagnetic fields nec- essarily precedes the discovery of radio stars and nuclear magnetic resonance. It is also progressive in various ways. As it continues, our field of observation is extended, our knowledge of details is filled in, and our insight and understanding is deepened. Some sense of confident conviction concerning the depend- ability of achieved scientific knowledge probably underlies the working position of most responsible scientists - one has, in effect, to believe some things in order to question or investigate others. But when a scientist affirms any particular scientific finding his attitude is necessarily more cautious. Many ' 'discoveries' ' have turned out to be false; many scientifically established facts and constructs (e.g., the concentric celestial spheres of Aristotle and Eudoxus, caloric fluid, the absolute invariability of Newtonian</page><page sequence="6">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 65 mass) have had to be abandoned. Moreover, scientific knowledge has passed through two major revolutions since the days of the Greeks, the second of which, profoundly shocking in its impli- cations for common sense, is by no means fully assimilated into today's science. The scientific enterprise is, in short, hazardous and subject, perhaps inherently, to the peril that future findings may unsettle the apparently secure basis upon which men have stood in estab- lishing current knowledge. One by-product of such disturbances is that many former scientific convictions, when seen in retrospect, may appear narrowly dogmatic, wrong-headed, or even down- right foolish. This is naturally painful and disruptive, and leads at the level of practice to a certain austerity in the canons of scientific caution by means of which men strive to protect them- selves against similar debacles. It also leads to recurrent attempts to achieve more secure reformulations of the general doctrinal basis for scientific knowledge,3 reformulations which place a pre- mium on tentativeness, pare down the number of beliefs held with deep conviction, and perhaps change our attitude toward even the most basic of these beliefs. Such a shift toward tentativeness may well facilitate the pro- cess of smooth revision and healthy growth in science. Important scientific advances have often involved renunciation of established beliefs and constructs,4 and such renunciations are easier in a general climate of reserve, humility, or even skepticism than in one of firm dogmatic faith.* But while the perils of going astray (and the difficulties of struggling free from incorrect bodies of belief) are real enough, a counsel of caution by no means entails denial, as a matter of principle, that the "truth" may be dis- covered by scientists. Granting that total dogmatism defeats the progress of important discovery and that tentativeness is ap- propriate in substantial areas of scientific affirmation, one may well doubt that total skepticism and the know-nothing attitude sometimes advanced as the essential hallmark of scientific open- mindedness could produce any decent science at all.6 Moreover, the apotheosis of tentativeness, if carried far enough, lays open the whole practice of scientific inquiry to the charge of being * These attitudes are also helpful to the individual research scientist. The pitfalls arising from premature commitment to attractive hypotheses are well documented in the history of science and of human thought generally.</page><page sequence="7">66 SOUNDINGS nothing more than some sort of entertaining game, carried on with the support of the public treasury for personal amusement and prestige by a privileged elite and justified, if at all, only by its technological by-products.* Common-sense scientific realism, while it does counsel caution, nevertheless affirms that, by and large, the gains of scientific discovery have outweighed its losses, so that we have been ac- cumulating knowledge about the physical world since the dawn of civilization and in particular have learned a great deal about it since Copernicus, much of which is "for keeps" because it is essentially correct. Historical Perspectives on Instrumentalism The Positivistic Trend as Progressive Self-Purification We have outlined a realist view of scientific discovery and knowledge, tempered with a note of caution. Tentativeness and skeptical reserve have been recognized as often justifiable, but total agnosticism has been rejected. In its modern forms, the instrumentalist position seems to verge closely on such agnostic- ism in its avowed unconcern for physical reality as such. Responsible adherents of this approach have not, however, been aiming at a totally agnostic position. Their intention has been rather the isolation of those specific aspects or elements of science which have a special quality of total certainty, on which the claim of the sciences to public respect and belief may rest with assurance. Two aspects often singled out as credibility war- rants are empirical observability and logical (usually mathe- matical) coherence. It has sometimes been stated, in the empirical tradition of Francis Bacon and his successors, that while scientific theories may come and go the observations recorded in properly conducted laboratory experiments or field studies will go down through the centuries as true.* This rather extreme statement hardly does justice to the obviously basic and sometimes preponderant role ♦This is a major theme in a recent scathing indictment by Jacques Barzun of contemporary scientific civilization (Rl). t "That photographs are an extremely important feature of any book on atomic spectra may be emphasized by pointing out that, of all the theories and knowledge concerning atoms, the spectrum lines will remain the same for all time" (R29, p. vii).</page><page sequence="8">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 67 played in physics and other sciences by mathematical theories, so that even Bridgman, who began by restricting himself to laboratory operations of observation and measurement, came eventually to include "pencil-and-paper" operations within the purview of his philosophy. The web of logico-mathematical link- ages which gives coherence, and therefore enhanced credibility, to raw measurements seems to have played a more significant role in the doctrines of modern logical positivism than the em- pirical observations themselves. However, the bias among work- ing scientists is still apt to be in the direction of experimental observation as the court of last resort, with mathematical in- ference (based on earlier observations) providing guidance as to where the next judicial appeal should be made experimentally.* Thoroughgoing positivistic scientists such as Mach, Pearson, and Bridgman have gone still further. Traditionally, in terms of common sense or naive philosophical realism, observation has been regarded as an act of perception from which someone - in the present context a scientist - acquires knowledge of the world external to him. In the more extreme view, the substance of science lies in the experience of the observer and the value of scientific activity lies in the order and coherence it brings to this experience (by virtue of descriptive economy or the like), thus in effect leaving scientific knowledge without substantial objective content. Nothing need be said or asked about the ex- ternal world at all, since this world is essentially unknowable scientifically, anyway. Organized empirical experience has be- come more than the findings of a "court of last resort" regarding physical reality. It is all we can know, all "reality" the existence of which can be meaningfully discussed. Science, in fact, becomes for each scientist a rather private matter (Cf. Bridgman, R4). Remarkable as this doctrine is, and shocking as it is to tra- ditional common sense, it has evolved quite naturally out of the initially quite realistic empiricism that ushered in modern post- Copernican science, embodied in the work of Bacon which pro- vided so early and so influential a rationale for the seventeenth- * Exceptions to this prevailing attitude could be found among recent and contemporary theoretical physicists. It has been persuasively argued by G. Hoi ton (R16) that Einstein, who was for a while an empiricist, later be- came firmly committed to rational realism. Eddington would certainly be an exception, as would some others working today on general relativity theory or symmetry relationships.</page><page sequence="9">68 SOUNDINGS century practitioners of the new "experimental philosophy. " The dramatic successes of this philosophy, culminating in Newton's mechanics and cosmology, led in turn to its being examined more carefully during the eighteenth-century Enlightenment in order to specify the "positive" elements of knowledge it pro- vided.* This process culminated in the early nineteenth century with the enthusiastic excesses of Auguste Comte and his fol- lowers (Cf. Hayek, R13). Nineteenth-century developments took somewhat more diverse forms. In Great Britain there was an emphasis in philosophy on empiricism (in the skeptical tradition of Hume), with a con- comitant distrust of systematic mathematical theorizing. On the continent mathematical analysis was more central to physical science, steeped as it was in the traditions of the great French mathematical physicists. However, the thrust of emphasis was on the divorcing of sound science, conceived as the systematic mathematical rationalization of quantitative measurement, from dubious philosophical underpinnings, which were felt to be at the very best unnecessary baggage. By the end of the century a more radical agnosticism concerning physical reality (stimulated in part, no doubt, by the disturbing advent of the non-Euclidean geometries) developed in many quarters - notably in the work of Mach, Kirchhoff, Karl Pearson, Poincaré, and the American prag- matists. This climate of attitude was, of course, part of the im- mediate heritage of physicists working in the early twentieth century, attempting to cope with the implications of the second major modern scientific revolution. Closely associated with the modern instrumentalist interpre- tation of science is its self-image as the culmination of a process of purification within science, in which the correct methods of obtaining warrantable scientific findings have emerged out of a welter of fruitless or misleading approaches contaminating earlier and less enlightened stages in the development of human thought when it was handicapped by anthropomorphism, animism, and superstition. Condorcet and Comte both endorsed this view, and * As was done, for instance, by Condillac and Condorcet, who were both deeply interested in the fact and promise of scientific progress (Cf. Gillispie, RIO, pp. 164-178). The "positivism" of Comte, who popularized this term, is not to be confused with later, more agnostic philosophies such as logical positivism, although the ancestry is quite clear.</page><page sequence="10">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 69 it played an important role in optimistic nineteenth-century doc- trines of historical progress. In this process of purification, the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics became identified as an important locus of "pre- scien tifie" elements, and it was expected that scientific warrant- ability could be improved by the further expurgation from science of metaphysical holdovers from an earlier era. The attempts by Mach to cleanse mechanics of such "metaphysical holdovers" as absolute Newtonian space and time, and by Mach and others (e.g., Kirchhoff and Hertz) to eliminate or minimize the role of the "anthropomorphic" force concept, are cases in point. The value attributed by Einstein to his early reading of Mach is well known, and Einstein's rejection of absolute simultaneity as a key to his early riddles has been regarded as, and may actually have been, the expurgation of a metaphysical holdover from me- chanics.6 Such a self-interpretation, in which positivistic scientists and philosophers regard their doctrines as the explicit identification of a purifying process, is not without plausibility, and its wide- spread tacit acceptance today undoubtedly contributes to the as- sent which these doctrines have enjoyed in our time. Other interpretations are nevertheless possible. Moreover, the expurga- tion invited by positivist doctrine turns out in practice to be far from complete. Realism and Instrumentalism in Comtemporary Scientific Opinion Modern positivistic agnosticism has been credited (no doubt with some justice) with facilitating the twentieth-century revolu- tion in physics, which had to give up some cherished ontological commitments in order to go ahead. Einstein's previously noted indebtedness to Mach provides one example; another is the ex- plicit use made by Heisenberg, in formulating matrix mechanics during the 1920's, of the positivist dictum that only "observables" could legitimately play a part in physical theory. Thus the puri- fication process just depicted might be considered operative in twentieth-century science and Bridgman's widely accepted opera- tionalism might be regarded as its explicit acknowledgment by scientists. It is remarkable, nonetheless, that in day-to-day activ-</page><page sequence="11">70 SOUNDINGS ities and discussions at the research level an unmistakable note of realism persists. Careful attention to attitudes assumed and arguments given in a representative group of research papers at a scientific meeting (particularly during question and discussion periods) will yield ample evidence in support of this point. Participants talk about mesons, * 'strange" particles, crystal lattice imperfections, Van Allen electrons, and the magnetic fields in outer space with the same implicit confidence as that exhibited in our day-to-day talk about tables, hardware, and oranges. They may puzzle over whe- ther a particular observed effect is "real" or "instrumental" as seriously as a trial jury might worry over whether a reported noise was "really" a pistol shot. The remark "I believe it" occurs naturally in the course of research conversations, carrying its customary conviction and implication. Such strains of realist commitment also crop up in scientific publication. One example is cited (pejoratively) in the positiv- istic paper, previously cited, by the philosopher Paul Schmidt (R26, p. 31, footnote). The "offending" passage is taken from a standard advanced textbook in modern physics: The above experiment, and many others [referring to work in electron diffraction by Davisson and Germer, Kikuchi and G. P. Thomson], established beyond any possible doubt that all particles really do possess properties that are interpretable only in terms of waves. This is a tremendous, undeniable fact, which clearly must have profound effect upon our basic ideas of the mechanics of par- ticles. (R20, p. 83; see also p. 67) A thoroughgoing positivist must of necessity regard such a statement as a lapse from grace, or as a "survival" of contamination representing the failure of the scientist to comprehend the true nature of what he is about. Schmidt remarks, with professional asperity and provocative irony, that he is "surprised to find such phrases in such an excellent book."* * A similar example on the theoretical side is the following, taken from an advanced text on mathematical physics: "Now of course an actual physical problem will always have the right sort of boundary conditions to give it a unique answer (or, at least, so we all hope!), and if we make our statement of the problem correspond to the actualities we shall always have the right boundary conditions for the equations. But it is not always easy to tell just what boundary conditions correspond to 'actuality/ and it is well for us to know what conditions are suitable for what equations" (R21, p. 676; italics</page><page sequence="12">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 71 The apparently unregenerate stubbornness of scientists in talking or writing on occasion like realists may of course be regarded, in the light of the traditional positivistic self-interpreta- tion we have depicted, as a mere survival from an earlier "pre- scientific" way of thinking whose purging is not yet complete even in science. It might also be thought to satisfy a mere "psychologi- cal" craving on the part of scientists, something to be tolerated for its heuristic efficacy but not to be taken seriously philosophically. On the other hand, it is quite possible to question whether the persistence of realism in science is not, after all, evidence that the positivistic goal of total expurgation is a false one - that scientists are in no position to dispense altogether with realism, since they necessarily must deal with a real external world. Widespread official acceptance by scientists does nevertheless provide a serious prima facie case for the validity of operation- alism and related doctrines, and any serious alternative proposal should at least try to explain why so many of those who "know science best" have given explicit assent to the instrumentalist interpretation. There are two levels at which this general acceptance may reflect mere preoccupation among scientists with specialized methodology. The scientific enterprise has by now outgrown its heroic beginnings, during which any practicing scientist might be called upon to speak up and explain or justify science, and has developed into a vast and well organized complex, populated largely by specialists. The individual research worker is motivated chiefly to push forward on his own local sector, for which purpose he draws largely on the fund of physical instrumentation, mathe- matical technique, and industrial productivity at his disposal. Typically he is not called upon personally to explain or justify his work except in the narrow context of his professional milieu, and most of his working moments are thus devoted to problems of implementation rather than to questions of ultimate signi- ficance. This shift of emphasis, which differentiates the modern scientist from the earlier system-building natural philosopher, has proved prodigiously efficacious tactically, and it is hardly surprising to find members of the scientific community assenting supplied). Note the use of quotation marks around the word "actuality," a concession to established norms of scientific propriety in spite of which the word and concept forced themselves into the writing.</page><page sequence="13">72 SOUNDINGS to proposals by recognized authorities that methodology is the whole story. Furthermore, the average scientific research specialist is not a very competent witness to the overall significance of what he is doing, since he cares very little about the larger issues, regards them as unimportant or essentially inaccessible, and spends little professional time examining them. Such a description does not apply to those overtly positivistic scientists who have also been distinguished strategists of broader vision and concern, but here, too, preoccupation with methodology has played a significant role. Distinguished success in research requires energetic engage- ment with the tough technical puzzles - the failure, for instance, of classical electromagnetic theory to deal adequately with the photoelectric effect, the explication of the lines in the spectra of complex elements, the baffling multiplicity of today's "funda- mentar* particles. In the context of today's elaborate scientific structuring, even a master scientist must spend much of his energy working toward a fit between experimentally measured numbers and the computational results of mathematical formal- isms whose physical significance is far from clear. During the struggle, the correspondence of tentative working models to physi- cal reality is entirely subsidiary to the goal of finding some pat- terns of agreement with observation, even though fragmentary. On such an uncertain frontier, and within the structured technical efficiency of the laboratory, the machine shop, the computation center, the accelerator assembly, or Jahnke and Emde's Table of Functions,7 more fundamental questions are hardly pertinent. Still, in an assessment of the more basic beliefs of our scien- tific leaders, preoccupation with methodology can hardly be the whole story. Equally potent in its contribution is the intellectual tradition which provides earlier conditioning and later support for their opinions. The broad traditions of positivism, pragma- tism, and instrumentalism, whose genesis we have sketched, have functioned in this capacity for modern scientists, providing a philosophical bias as strong, perhaps, as the Aristotelian tradition against which Galileo rebelled. If this tradition is sound, then of course the scientific positivists are well advised in their continued adherence to its doctrines, persistent survivals of realism notwithstanding. We are question- ing the soundness of the tradition, of course, and central to the</page><page sequence="14">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 73 analysis at this point is its self-image as the outcome of a process of scientific self-purification. We wish now to suggest a different view of the origins of this tradition. The Polemical Aspects of Positivist Doctrine Post-Copernican views of scientific knowledge originated during an intellectual revolution of major magnitude, with pro- found implications for modern thought. Many of the more dra- matic issues of this upheaval centered around its substantive con- tent - the overthrow of Aristotelian physics and geocentric Ptolemaic cosmology - but its deeper effects lay in a change of accepted notions about the proper questions for scientific in- quiry. Specifically, the quest for quantitative, predictable relation- ships, expressible by algebraic functions and verifiable by quanti- tative measurement, replaced the earlier Aristotelian search for qualitative, comprehensive apprehension of rational knowledge about the physical universe - called epistëmë or scientia by the ancients.8 The controversial bitterness engendered by this revolu- tion was intense; it had to overthrow or radically alter a compactly woven, well-established body of doctrine about the content and nature of knowledge, and its polemical overtones lasted well into the eighteenth century, when the French Enlightenment gave triumphant expression to the victory of Newtonian physics, Co- pernican astronomy, and (more profoundly) a new way of looking at human knowledge. Now major revolutions leave a lasting imprint. In the tradition initiated by such cataclysms the slogans which help win the victory become enshrined in all their one-sidedness and the compromises which help to make the peace persist in all their arbitrariness. And any general philosophy emerging under such circumstances partakes of the nature of an "ideology" - a system of ideas em- ployed quasi-politically during the struggle, to gain ascendancy over the minds of men. This is not to say that such philosophical discourse is nec- essarily a mere rationalization of the will to convince. One may surely hope that some philosophical positions are definitely better than others, judged in the light of less superficial criteria than that of forensic potency. In the long run, we all hope, the truth will prevail. But what prevails in the short run is not necessarily, by virtue of its victory, the best version of the truth; on the</page><page sequence="15">74 SOUNDINGS contrary, it is liable to prove one-sided and arbitrary. The polem- ical implications of philosophical systems do tend to distort their development;9 we suggest specifically that such distortion was present in seventeenth-century interpretations of the newly emerging science, and that it has persisted into twentieth-century instrumentalism. More concretely, it would seem that its interpreters and spokes- men have claimed too much for science on the one hand and too little for human cognition on the other - too much in the apotheosis of narrowly defined "scientific method" as possessing superior claims to credibility, and too little in the unjustifiable exclusion from the domain of dependable knowability of large areas in human experience which are just as "knowable" as the Van Allen layer or the sun's magnetic dipóle moment. In the seventeenth-century battle for the minds of men, scientists and their spokesmen had two powerful weapons: the appeal to the senses via a newly expanding experimental tech- nology, and the new "calculus of observations" provided by a rapidly developing art of mathematical computation and analy- sis. "Seeing is believing" is an old human adage - much older, one presumes, than Bacon or Boyle - and so also is the adage that "figures don't lie." The union of instrumental observation with mathematical reckoning provided, in addition to a novel and expanding universe of discourse, a new forensic arsenal which ultimately carried the day for the Copernicans and Newtonians against their opponents. The convincing power of a look through the new telescope at the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus has made this historical incident a tactical paradigm for hard-headed experimentalists ever since. The derivation by New- ton of both the observationally precise laws of Kepler and the correctly described projectile motion of Galileo's kinematics from the same simple assumptions was similarly striking, a con- vincing tour de force; without it, the conceptual underpinnings of Newtonian cosmology would have had much tougher sledding against competing world views (e.g., Cartesian vortex theory). Observing and calculating have always played a fundamental role in guiding human beings to dependable knowledge. After Kepler, Galileo, and Newton they came into enhanced prestige - the work of these men became, in short, a paradigm for properly directed scientific inquiry. And along with this new respect for instrumental observation and mathematical calculation came a</page><page sequence="16">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 75 certain disdain, echoing the disparagement by Francis Bacon, for the speculative and dialectical process of rational discourse which had characterized the vanquished scholastic adversaries. It was this emergent complex (often referred to as "the experimental philosophy" by its earlier practitioners) that as it developed became known and apotheosized as "the scientific method." Coupled with the new locus of cognitive dependability was a recognition of the limited applicability of the new methodology and the exclusion from scientific concern of material for which it was unsuitable. Intellectual historians often refer to this ex- clusion as the "Cartesian Compromise," for it was by means of such a demarcation that Descartes, a profoundly religious man, made his peace with the essentially impersonal and mechanistic character of seventeenth-century science. On one side of the line were personal human purpose, destiny, and will - safe from the cool critical scrutiny of the mechanistic science whose findings had already proved so traumatic and which was in this realm in- applicable. On the other side was the locus of scientific compe- tence - a soulless physical universe of matter, atoms, and motion, essentially automatic in its operation and dramatically accessible to the new methodology. For scientists the Cartesian compromise had the great ad- vantage that it left them free to devote themselves to their new exploration unencumbered by responsibility for the ultimates of existence, which might comfortably be left for theologians, phi- losophers, and poets. It gave carte blanche for physical discovery and provided for three centuries (as it still does) a respected barrier behind which working scientists might conveniently pur- sue their research, untrammelled by the constraints of personal conscience and/or political and religious censorship. In spite of occasional warfare and some minor "border incidents," relatively peaceful coexistence has prevailed in modern life between science and older forms of knowledge. With the further spectacular successes of scientific method- ology in the nineteenth century came its expansion into new areas of investigation, coupled, more importantly, with increas- ingly exclusive claims for cognitive status. A tendency developed to equate the "scientific" with the reliable, and to exclude from the domain of knowability a vast realm of human concern, officially subject to discount as "subjective" or "metaphysical." The paradoxical aspect of this development came to light</page><page sequence="17">76 SOUNDINGS when these agnostic aspects of positivism began to weaken the cognitive claim of science itself. For the effect of modern in- strumentalism, in its attempt to purge accredited knowledge of its residual "unscientific" elements, has been to deny within sci- ence the very element of truth (that is, truth about the physical world) which was initially the most important basis for the respect accorded to scientific findings, and to the scientific enterprise. Thus the stage was set for a modern scientific "retreat from reality" which would be remarkable and shocking indeed, were it not by now so familiar and so widely proclaimed. The Present and Future Status of Scientific Knowledge Realists and instrumentalists can agree, we assume, that scien- tific findings convey a respectable title to cognitive authority of some sort; such findings do at least tell us how to make a nuclear reactor or travel to the moon. Common. sense suggests, as already noted, that something more is involved than mere know-how, and that the physical universe, with all its fascinating multiplicity of atoms, electrons, electromagnetic fields, and variable stars, is being in some valid sense "discovered" by modern science, not merely dreamed up as a set of useful constructs to organize human experience and effort. The narrower purview of scientific posi- tivism, however, insists that the essential content of science is the more limited one, and that the images conjured up by the illus- trative items just enumerated are merely imaginative projections or "models" whose only justification is heuristic, psychological, or technological. We are contending that common sense is right, and that the narrower view amounts to an unfortunate and unnecessary aban- donment of justifiable claims for scientific knowledge. In analyzing the genesis of positivistic doctrine, we have cited the revolutionary origins of modern science and certain excessive claims for the status of scientific findings and methods which grew up under the stress of polemical tensions. These claims have attributed a su- periority (if not an actual infallibility) to scientifically certified methodology, with a concomitant disparagement of other "un- scientific" modes of access to knowledge. If the view we have advanced is sound, some reconstruction of our ideas about knowl- edge in general and scientific knowledge in particular is in order. Whatever one may hold about the warrantability of the</page><page sequence="18">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 77 knowledge obtained under the guidance of the Newtonian para- digm and its multiform subvariants, it is clear that in actual practice this knowledge is only a limited portion of that on which we confidently rely. Common sense and rudimentary per- ception provide countless examples of knowledge which is securely held in spite of its lack of validation in any conventionally scien- tific manner, as do also the more structured areas of legal fact- finding by "due process" and the research of the scholar and historian based on very ancient methods of record-keeping, exe- gesis, and the critical evaluation of sources. We know our own birthdays and our own enthusiasms, past and present, with a clear certainty which owes nothing to integral calculus, matrix algebra, or quantitative laboratory measurement. Apparently "scientific method" has no really secure corner on the certainty market, and while "fitting pointer readings to mathematical equa- tions" or "economical storage and organization of experimental data" may be useful phrases in describing much legitimate scien- tific activity, they can hardly claim full title as characterizing all we count truly or certainly knowable.10 Much of our "unscientific" knowledge is of a humbler sort, and for it we are frequently more willing to acknowledge an element of intuition (a "tacit" component, in Michael Polanyi's terminology) which is officially proscribed from explicitly attested scientific finding. Such a component involves ingredients which are resistant to attempts at formal specification. They have at times been called "preconceptions" (or "metaphysical preconcep- tions"), though it might be simpler to call them "assumptions" or even (if the phrase is not too offensive to secular prejudice) unconscious "leaps of faith." That they may lead to accurate apprehensions of reality is a fact of common observation, though it is equally notable that they are subject to error. A paradigm of such an apprehension is the imaginative projection of a young child who divines accurately a parent's mood and intention though denied immediate empirical access to them. In such apprehen- sions immediate empirical evidence functions by providing clues and confirmations, though never final certification. The general program for achieving total scientific certainty which has provided inspiration for so many during the post- Copernican era (especially since the Enlightenment) has been to divest science of precisely these elements and thereby to demon-</page><page sequence="19">78 SOUNDINGS strate by experiment and analysis a totally impregnable structure of absolute knowledge, free of the hazards inherent in intuition and hunch; and traditional histories of science purport to be accounts of progress within this program. In the light of more recent studies in this discipline, however, it seems increasingly evident that earlier accounts of scientific discovery and scientific knowledge have been too narrowly focused, and one may wonder today whether the program has not itself been misconceived. Basic scientific discoveries seem almost invariably to depend on heuristic thinking, flashes of insight, and inspired hunches. Truly significant knowledge, even the most securely "scientific," seems to require, in its genesis and probably also in its perpetua- tion, elements of faith and preconception irreducible to the purely formal analytical and crudely empirical basis within which we have attempted to encompass it.11 Somewhere in every complex of thought and observation which purports to issue in a new scientific truth, there is, it would seem, an intuitive basis of tacit assumption similar to that which characterizes our less pretentious (and "unscientific") acts of perception and inference. Ironically, frank recognition and acceptance of such elements, fallible though they are, might have the effect of dissipating some of the agnosticism within science against which we have been protesting. Our traditional classification of human values subsumes human aspiration and achievement under the categories of Truth, Good- ness, and Beauty. The Cartesian compromise allotted to scienti- fic inquiry the cultivation of a particular area of Truth as its special domain. Earlier scientific workers, all the way through the first half of the nineteenth century, enjoyed the assurance that they were discovering fundamental truths about the physical world. They did, of course, recognize the existence of matters on the other side of the Cartesian line, but always within the context of admitted incompetence to deal with them professionally and usually with the imputation of their irrelevance to science. Today this presumed professional incompetence has been para- doxically extended by modern instrumentalist doctrines to all of the Truth, including the truth about the physical world which was originally a part of the scientific charter. If the tacit elements we have discussed are indeed indispens- able to all confident knowledge, including the scientific, it is easy to understand why resolute attempts to purge them from science</page><page sequence="20">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 79 might result in a sterile agnosticism, such as modern operation- alist doctrine seems to contain, and why such doctrine must necessarily be taken lightly in practice by men engaged in scien- tific research. It would also appear that the absolute instrumenta- list interpretation of science should be abandoned as inadequate and misleading. The instrumentalist position may be characterized as an at- tempt to hang on to infallibility by giving up the objective content of that which is infallible. A modern realistic interpreter of science, even though he no longer seeks infallibility, might still retain (coupled with a certain epistemological humility) a strong measure of confidence in the findings of scientific inquiry. These findings, one might admit, are never impregnably infallible, just as none of them is in principle immune from further critical scrutiny. On the other hand, we may hold with considerable confidence that many or most of them are essentially true, even though they can never be underwritten by the conclusive final demonstration envisaged in earlier aspirations. It is tempting at this point to go further and attempt some analysis of the nature and reliability of knowledge on the "un- scientific" side of the Cartesian line of demarcation. This would, however, be beyond the scope of the present essay. From the point of view of the scientific community, which still occasionally bridles at humanist disparagement, it may be remarked that we have little to lose, in the climate of today's operationalist agnosti- cism, by admitting to past error in the attribution to scientific methodology of a superior potency in yielding reliable knowledge, an attribution which has at times verged on a mystique clearly at variance with the facts of human existence. The humanists have surely been correct in implying this, and it can hardly detract from the rebuttal of their less tenable sallies to admit honestly the existence of much rightfully established knowledge sustained without benefit of the pattern of scientific validation associated with such names as Newton, Ampère, Maxwell, Ein- stein, and Bohr. The price of such modesty seems small indeed if it permits us to avoid the absurdity of our present pretensions to ignorance! Conclusion The preceding analysis has questioned the soundness of positivism as a philosophical position. As a working approach in</page><page sequence="21">80 SOUNDINGS scientific inquiry its value has not been questioned. The instru- mentalist state of mind functions legitimately as a suspension of judgment concerning the physical reality of newly conceived and tentatively reified entities, frequently operating over prolonged periods of testing after which the presumed entities are either dropped or accepted as belonging permanently to the established body of scientific knowledge. The questions raised here have not been strategic ones, directed toward the degree of tentativeness appropriate to scientific inquiry, but basic ones regarding the validity of epistemological doctrines postulating that the real world is essentially unknowable. So long as modern physics provides a crucial focus of un- resolved philosophical perplexity, much of the argument bearing on the acceptability or inevitability of positivism in its finalistic sense will doubtless hinge on whether currently orthodox inter- pretations of quantum mechanics hold up. While this question has not been examined here, it should be noted that a satisfactory and self-consistent interpretation has yet to be achieved, as evi- denced by the fact of continuing debate among scientists on the subject.12 The orthodox interpretations, which are sometimes credited with providing the final and unassailable positivist argu- ment, cannot at present be considered conclusively established, and until they are the likelihood or possibility persists that new and more attractive alternatives will be found. It may also be noted that quantum physics developed during a period when the general climate of philosophical opinion seemed sympathetic to positivism and provided ancillary support and inspiration for the heuristic development of physical theories. During the past twenty years, however, logical positivism has been subject to continuing internal criticism among philosophers, and its standing within the discipline has noticeably declined.13 As a force supporting the orthodox interpretations of quantum physics it provides considerably less comfort and strength today than it gave during the 1920's. It seems safe to predict that positivism, as a philosophical doctrine, has inherently difficult problems which will persist. Al- though not solipsistic in intent, it seems afflicted with a skeptical animus that drifts toward solipsism. And solipsism as a way of looking at human experience is in the long run as unsatisfactory to the philosopher and the working scientist as it is to the man</page><page sequence="22">THE INSTRUMENTALIST INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE 81 in the street. Except for a few hardy skeptics, sane philosophers, like sane scientists and sane people generally, must perforce come around to ratifying formally the unconscious ontological com- mitment we all share concerning the existence of a real world, external to individual experience and to some degree knowable. Doubtless Karl Popper is correct in affirming the impossibility of returning to any naive Aristotelian doctrine of essence. Doubt- less also much problematic reflection lies ahead of us before we have fully assimilated the import and status of modern scientific knowledge in such a way as to provide a satisfactory new unified understanding of physical reality. At this point in the history of human thought, it is difficult to conjecture and certainly im- possible to predict what additional elements or reformulations will be incorporated into such an understanding, but we do ven- ture to predict that it can and will be achieved. NOTES 1. R12, p. 4. In the second (1955) edition of Halliday's text, the philosophi- cal passages cited had been revised and were considerably more non- committal on this point. 2. For a good clear exposition of the modern interplay between the realist and instrumentalist views of scientific knowledge, see Ch. 1 in Mary Hesse, R15. The essay of Karl Popper (R25), already cited, is likewise clear and suggestive. For a recent sharp attack on the positivist position by a prominent though controversial philosopher-scientist, see Michael Polanyi's writings, notably R22 and R23. 3. Thus the shock effects on physicists of relativity and quantum physics contributed importantly to Bridgman's motivation. In the opening state- ment to his first important essay introducing operationalism, he remarks: "We should now make it our business to understand so thoroughly the character of our permanent mental relations to nature that another change in our attitude, such as that due to Einstein, shall be forever im- possible" (R5, p. 2). 4. As an example, see the lucid account by F. J. Dyson (R8) of how this process of conceptual renunciation operated in the assimilation into physics of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, and later of quantum theory. The renunciation process may be characterized by the remark, sometimes addressed to students whose common sense is baffled by quantum theory, that they must study it until they realize "that there is nothing to under- stand," i.e., until their minds have surrendered the classical particle concepts initially blocking assimilation. 5. Michael Polanyi has recently laid great stress on this point (Cf. R23, Ch. 6. Einstein's later reservations concerning Mach (less widely known than his earlier indebtedness) are discussed and documented in the Holton article (R16) cited earlier.</page><page sequence="23">82 SOUNDINGS 7. For a classic exposition of the relationship between philosophical posi- tivism and methodology, see Burtt, R6, Section 2, Ch. VII. 8. For a more extensive analysis of this change, as well as of the role played by the Cartesian Compromise in facilitating early modern scientific prog- ress, see Crombie, R7. 9. This general thesis bears some resemblance, and owes some debt, to the recent work by T. S. Kuhn on scientific revolutions (Cf. R18, Ch. XII). An important difference lies in the fact that the present paper, while sharing Kuhn's view that scientific revolutions have important sociologi- cal aspects within the scientific community (and are not purely intel- lectual matters) does not subscribe to his historical relativism, i.e., to the notion that essentially incommensurable discontinuities are inherent between prerevolutionarv and postrevolutionarv knowledge. 10. Michael Polanyi has discussed extensively, as "connoisseurship," a range of secure knowledge which is excluded by or peripheral to the narrower scientific paradigms as commonly discussed. See, for instance, R22, pp. 52-55 and other indexed oassaees. 11. Such emerging historiographie reformulation is evident, for instance, in Gerald Holton's treatment of the "thematic" element in scientific dis- covery, which emphasizes the formerly neglected aspects here noted (Cf., e.g., R17). Polanyi's concern with "believing as a precondition for knowing," the revival of an older notion, is also a significant contemporary departure (Cf. R23, Part I, Section IV, and Part II, Section I). The role and psychology of heuristic thinking in mathematical discovery have been analyzed by Tacques Hadamard (RII). 12. Some of this debate (though not all) stems from the "Hidden Variable" theories of David Böhm, first publicly advanced in 1952 (See R2, R3). Another recent attack on the orthodox interpretation has been made by Alfred Lande (Cf. R19), and still other uneasy attempts at reformulation have been made by Wigner (Cf., e.g., R30). 13. Logical positivism and linguistic analysis have been weakened by unsym- pathetic critics like Polanyi and Popper. Along with this attrition has come growing dissatisfaction arising from continuing analytic develop- ment, by the logical positivists themselves, of their own doctrines.
