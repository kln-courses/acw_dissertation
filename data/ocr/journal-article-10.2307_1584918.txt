[H.G.M. WILLAMSON] 0. KAISER, Gottes und der Menschen Weisheit. Gesammelte Aufsdtze. BZAW 261. viii + 321 pp. DM 168. W. de Gruyter, Berlin, 1998. The volume is a collection of fifteen previously published studies (all in German) by the professor emeritus of Marburg University, written between 1987 and 1997. The essays deal with questions regarding biblical and Greek wisdom and centre around the main insight of the finitude of human existence and the infinitude, transcendence and immanence of God. The titles of the essays are as follows: "Die Ersten und die Letzten Dinge"; "Einfache Sittlichkeit und theonome Ethik in der alttestamentlichen Weisheit"; "Der Mensch, Gottes Ebenbild und Statthalter auf Erden"; "Erwagungen zu Ps viii"; "Ps xxxix"; "Schicksal, Leid und Gott. Ein Gesprach mit dem Kohelet, Prediger Salomo"; "Determination und Freiheit beim Kohelet/Prediger Salomo und in der Frihen Stoa"; "Die Botschaft des Buches Kohelet"; "Beitrage zur Kohelet-Forschung"; "Anknupfung und Widerspruch. Die Antwort der judischen Weisheit auf die Herausforderung durch den Hellenismus"; "Was der Freund nicht tun darf. Eine Auslegung von Sir xxvii 16-21"; "Der Tod des Sokrates"; "Die Rede von Gott am Ende des 20. Jahrhundert"; "Die Bedeutung des Alten Testa- ments fur Heiden, die manchmal auch Christen sind". Detailed indexes of biblical ref- erences as well as authors, persons and items conclude this useful collection. [A.C. HAGEDORN] M. KLINGBEIL, Yahweh Fighting from Heaven. God as Warrior and as God of Heaven in the Hebrew Psalter and Ancient Near Eastern Iconography. OBO 169. xii + 361 pp. Universitatsverlag, Freiburg/Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Gottingen, 1999. The title of this book perfectly describes its contents: Klingbeil compares the metaphors used in the Psalter with pictorial representations of ancient Near Eastern deities. He begins by surveying theories of metaphor and then charts the occurrence of various metaphors in the Psalter. The Warrior motif occurs almost exclusively in Books 1 and 2, with few in Book 3 and none in Books 4 and 5. There follows a detailed study of selected passages from Psalms xviii, xxi, xxix, xlvi, lxv, lxviii, lxxxiii and cxliv, concluding with more interesting charts of word distribution which show that there is virtually nothing in common between the texts apart from the divine name. The final part is a fasci- nating close inspection of 93 depictions of divine figures in ancient iconography, cov- ering far more than just warrior figures. Klingbeil concludes that the psalms employ a limited set of metaphors for God, of which two-thirds are anthropomorphic (p. 304). He cautiously offers an interesting conclusion: "As a compilation of hymns and songs, it is reasonable and possible to assume a rough chronological order for the Hebrew Psalter... If one correlates the decreasing frequency ... of the divine warrior metaphor, it appears that the metaphor lost its popularity..." (p. 305). He speculates about the possible dating of these psalms in view of the fact that the relevant iconography dates from the 9th to 7th centuries, and notes that this warrior motif, important in the "early" psalms, was also important in the Book of Revelation. It would have been interesting to see a similar study of anthropomorphisms, perhaps in relation to the demise of the monarchy and the survival of its ideology in Christianity. The Older Testament again? [Margaret BARKER] A. VAN DER KooIJ, The Oracle of Tyre: The Septuagint of Isaiah 23 as Version and Vision. SVT 71. x + 214 pp. Brill, Leiden, 1998. In preparing the text of Isaiah for Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ), van der Kooij has produced this monograph that pro- vides a contribution both to the exegesis of the Septuagint of Isaiah and to the eval- uation of the Septuagint for text-critical purposes. Van der Kooij locates himself within the field of Septuagint interpreters, in the tradition of Z. Frankel from the nineteenth century and L. Prijs and J. Schaper from the twentieth, as emphasizing the exegetical</page><page sequence="2">410 BOOK LIST role of the translator. He therefore advocates that correction of the Masoretic Text towards the Septuagint should be made only after the intentions and interpretative techniques of the translator have been assessed. This he demonstrates with a detailed analysis of Isaiah xxiii, "The Oracle of Tyre", which is called in the Septuagint "The Vision of Tyre", a title that demonstrates the translator's reinterpretation of the pas- sage as an actualized prophecy for his own time. The text is presented as witnessing to the political events of the time of the translator. and in particular to the destruction of Carthage by Rome (146 B.C.), the Parthian invasion of Babylonia and the involve- ment of Tyre (and other Phoenician cities) in the Hellenization of Jerusalem. Van der Kooij concludes with a summary of the evidence from the revisions of the Septuagint text and with an Appendix presenting the text-critical notes as they will appear in BHQ Van der Kooij presents his argument well and provides in this book a useful addition to the important case for reading the Septuagint as a document of its own time. One minor criticism is of the manner in which he presents his argument. He offers two options for understanding the translator: that he was either a "dragoman" reading the text on the level of words and phrases but including copyist-type errors, or that he was a "scribe" trained in the reading of the Hebrew text and familiar with exegetical traditions (e.g. pp. 8, 118, 120). There are many different levels on which one might view an LXX translator, including that of an accurate translator who is neither a "dragoman" nor a "scribe" producing a reinterpretation of the text. Whilst van der Kooij demonstrates successfully that the translator of Isaiah xxiii has inter- preted the text, the two opposing options may not be subtle enough to be applied to other parts of the LXX. [J.K. AITKEN] J. KRASovEC (ed.), Interpretation of the Bible. JSOT Supplement Series 289. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, 1998. The over 1900 pages of this unusual volume contain much of interest to students of the Hebrew Bible. The volume arises out of an inter- national symposium held in September 1996 in Ljubljana, in the Republic of Slovenia, to mark the publication of a new Slovenian version of the Bible. Comprising a col- lection of papers delivered at the symposium and of specially commissioned essays, the volume is arranged in three parts, focusing on I. ancient hermeneutics and Bible trans- lation, II. Slavonic and other translations (Croatian, Czech, Hungarian, Pennsylvania Dutch, Polish, the Scandinavian languages, etc.), and III. biblical interpretation in var- ious fields. Many names familiar to VT readers are included among the contributors, as well as many accomplished specialists less well known in the West. A modest sam- pling of essays of particular interest to students of the OT would include: E. Tov, "Sense Divisions in the Qumran Texts, the Masoretic Text, and Ancient Translations of the Bible"; J. Lust, "Messianism in the Septuagint: Isaiah 8:23b-9:6 (9:1-7)"; M.L. Klein, "The Aramaic Targumim: Translation and Interpretation"; R.P. Gordon, "The Syriac Old Testament: Provenance, Perspective, and Translation Technique"; N. Lohfink, "Kohelet Ubersetzen: Berichte aus einer Ubersetzerwerkstatt"; J.H. Charlesworth, "Polanyi, Merleau-Ponty, Arendt, and the Foundation of Biblical Hermeneutics"; A.C. Thiselton, "Thirty Years of Hermeneutics: Retrospects and Prospects"; and DJ.A. Clines, "The Postmodern Adventure in Biblical Studies." This list only scratches the surface of the volume's eighty-two chapters. Most of the essays are in English, a few in German or French. Each essay is accompanied by an introductory abstract and a concluding summary both in the language of the essay and in Slovenian. A minor crit- icism is that for some of the essays there is little distinction between the opening abstract and the concluding summary. Inevitably in a collection of this sort the essays vary con- siderably in both quality and length, though the former is generally quite high. As to the latter, the length ranges from under ten pages to the specially commissioned 100-plus pages of M. van Esbroeck's "Les versions orientales de la Bible: une orien- tation bibliographique" and the 300-plus pages of F. J. Thomson's monographic "The Slavonic Translation of the Old Testament". In keeping with the occasioning event,</page></plain_text>
