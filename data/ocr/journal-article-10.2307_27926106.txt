HOLUM Department of History University of Maryland IN 1986 the Hebrew University and the University of Maryland renewed excava tions at Rehovot-in-the-Negev (Refcovot ba-Negev, Kh. Rufceibeh).* Five areas were investigated, all of which had been begun in earlier seasons.2 I. AREA ? RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ON THE SOUTHERN FRINGES OF THE TOWN (Figs. 1-2, PI. 21: A) In the 1979 season, five rooms belonging to two houses were excavated in full or in part.3 In 1986 another section was made in one of the rooms that had already been excavated (Locus 206). Also excavated were parts of the central courtyard of the same building (L. 223), another room south of the courtyard (L. 224), and a section in the slope of the hill above the riverbed of Naftal Shunra, where the well and the main route from Halu?a (Elusa) to Ni??ana (Nessana) and the central Sinai are located. More information was collected on the building techniques used in residential structures. The houses were adjacent to one another, with more than one 1 The excavation season took place from 6 to 31 July 1986. The excavations were carried out on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and the University of Maryland, College Park, and were directed by Y. Tsafrir (the Hebrew University) and K.G. Holum (University of Maryland). The team consisted of students from both institutions and more than 60 volunteers. Area supervisors were: C. Lehmann (Area B), Ya'el Gorin and M. Dadon (Area C), Rika Itzhaki and O. Moran (Area D), D. Strong (Area E), and N. Schlanger (Area T, cemetery). I. Hershkovitz of the Department of Anthropology, Tel Aviv University, led a physical anthropology team. The architect was Robin Ziek. Claudia Vess served as photographer, and J. Kessler assisted with end-of-dig shots. Sarai Tsafrir and G. Alkalay directed the expedition camp. Financial aid was provided by Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, D.C., and the National Center for Constitutional Research, also in Washington, and its president W.C. Skousen. The Dorot Foundation of New York has offered a grant for preparing publications. In addition the excavators would like to thank the following for their assistance: Kibbutz Revivim, especially Ziva and R. Yodfat; Midrashat Sde Boqer and Kibbutz Sde Boqer; the Archaeological Survey of Israel; the Israel Exploration Society; J. Ginat; and the Israel Defence Forces. The late Y. Cohen of Kibbutz Sde Boqer was most helpful. 2 Hadashot Arkheologiyot 90 (1987), pp. 54-56. For the site in general and previous excavation seasons, see Y. Tsafrir: Refoovot (Kh.

One house could be distinguished from another because the rooms belonging to each are grouped around a central courtyard. The ground plan of the houses is irregular, and the size of the rooms varies. The rooms are generally rectangular, but some are trapezoidal. The walls, about 70 cm. thick, were built of local limestone and coated with plaster, with roofs constructed of long stone slabs supported on arches, as in other Byzantine towns in the Negev. In the courtyard excavated in Area (L. 223) a gutter was found that collected rainfall from the roof, and there was a stone channel that led water to a cistern (not yet excavated) (PL 21: A). The section on the slope demonstrated that buildings were also constructed on the upper part of the slope looking south. Their exteriors were connected with each other by a wall that blocked the intervals between them from the outside. The passage between two rooms (L. 224 and L. 226) was blocked, and it appears</page><page sequence="3">EXCAVATIONS AT REtfOVOT-IN-THE-NEGEV 119 Fig. 2. Area B, Locus 206, north-south section (looking west). Key: (1) Dark greyish-brown, loose silt mixed with ash and a few cobblestones; (2) Pale brown, fine sand with some small pebbles; (3) Brownish-yellow, fine loose sand with very small pebbles and lime; (4) Very pale brown, fine compact sand with very small pebbles, lime and a few cobbles; (5) Fine, loose yellow sand. that the southern room (L. 226) had passed out of use, because the arches that had supported its ceiling were removed and their spring courses cut down to the surface of the wall. It is difficult to say whether this was a special case, or whether it reveals reinforcement of the southern border of the town at the end of the Byzantine period against possible raids of the nomadic desert tribes. Examination of the pottery shows that the quarter at the edge of the town was built not earlier than the fifth or sixth centuries C.E., when the town expanded towards the south. In addition to the pottery, many fragments of glass, bronze, bone, wood, ivory and a small gold pendant were found, as well as several coins. The sections that were cut in the rooms gave information on the process of desertion and destruction after the Arab conquest. It seems that several rooms were occupied by squatters who settled after the house had been deserted by its original inhabitants. The new settlers removed flagstones and left behind fireplaces and layers of ashes interrupted by layers of sand and loess soil, that accumulated during periods of destruction. The pottery, like elsewhere in the Early Islamic of the Negev, is based on former Byzantine types. From the absence of any typical eighth century pottery, even in the latest layers of occupation, we learn that this quarter was completely abandoned not later than the beginning of the eighth century C.E. This conclusion accords with finds from other areas as well. II. AREA C ? THE STABLE BUILDING IN THE CITY CENTRE (Fig. 3, Pis. 21:B-C) Area C contains a building made of four wings of rooms flanking a central court.4 Its external measurements are 31 m. north-south and about 28 m. east-west. After the 1979 season, it was suggested that the building was founded in the time of the 4 For previous excavations, see ibid., pp. 11-13, and Fig. 3.</page><page sequence="4">120 Y. TSAFRIR AND K.G. HOLUM VD L_ O t Fig. 3. Area C; the stable buildings. Provincia Arabia during the second or third century C.E. This suggestion was based on stratified Nabataean pottery and a bilingual Nabataean-Greek inscription incised on a stone (although it was not found in situ). Because of the large dimensions of the building (one of the largest in the town at the time of its</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT REflOVOT-IN-THE-NEGEV 121 construction), we suggested that it served as a khan or caravanserai. Other suggestions were that the building served as a barracks for a military unit or was simply the residence of a wealthy citizen. We cannot be certain about the function of the building, even after the 1986 season. In 1979 two of the rooms of the west wing (L. 300, 301) were excavated completely, together with a small part of the entrance (L. 318), part of the central courtyard, and a small part of a stable located in the north-western wing of the house, west of the entrance. Also uncovered was part of a room (L. 313) that was built above the ruins of the Byzantine period and included in its walls decorated stones from the neighbouring Central Church. This room is so far the only one excavated at Refrovot that was built originally in the Early Islamic period and is not just an example of secondary use of a Byzantine edifice or a temporary structure. In 1986 we completed excavating this room and cut a section beneath its floor. The section confirms the stratigraphy and general dating presented above, but a more precise dating within the Early Islamic period is not possible. The major part of the work in 1986 was in the wing with the stable. The inner dimensions of the stable are 7.2 9.2 m. The stable was divided into three spaces (L. 320, 306, 321, from west to east) by two walls with troughs made of stone slabs. The width of the troughs, including side-slabs, is 72 cm., and their length is 1.1-1.2 m. Each line included four troughs. The pillars between the troughs supported stone lintels, and the spans were roofed by arches (Pis. 21:B-C). Although the height of the troughs, about 1.1 m., is higher than is common in stables today, it is likely that the stable was used for horses. The main entrance to the stable led from the court to the central room of the stable, and from here two doors, about 0.9 m. wide, led into the side rooms. The width of the side rooms varies from 2.15 m. (west) to 2.30 m. (east). It is difficult to say whether the horses were stabled in the side rooms, which would give sufficient if rather crowded room for horses, or in the central room (3.3 m. wide). Perhaps they were kept both in the side and central rooms. The stable at Rehovot is similar in plan to the stables at Mamshit and Shivta. As mentioned above (p. 120), we believe that this stable was built in the time of the Provincia Arabia. Underneath the floor level of the stable and above bedrock we found fragments of Eastern Sigillata pottery and painted Nabataean sherds, typical of the first century B.C.E. and the first century CE. In the Byzantine period the stable's original floor, perhaps of beaten earth, was replaced with a floor of flagstones. Beneath one of the surviving flagstones in L. 320, the excavators found a nearly intact bag-shaped storage jar from the Byzantine period, with an as yet unread Greek dipinto. In the building's entrance corridor, L. 318, three phases of use came to light in the course of the 1986 season. In the doorway, a later threshold, perhaps from the Byzantine period, was superimposed over the original one. In the Early Islamic period a buttressing wall</page><page sequence="6">122 Y. TSAFRIR AND K.G. HOLUM was built against the corridor's original eastern wall, which had apparently threatened to collapse. Not long thereafter, the building began to collapse. The excavators found the rooms of the stable packed with roofing slabs, voussoirs, wall blocks, and other building debris to a height of 2 m. or more. III. AREA D ? THE CENTRAL CHURCH (Fig. 4, PL 22:A-C) The Central Church is a monoapsidal basilica, of a type that is considered earlier in the Negev than the triapsidal churches,5 such as the northern and eastern l- -?? 284.30 Fig. 4.

Its central location indicates that this was the earliest church in the town. The church could well have been erected as early as the second half of the fourth century, and its foundation may have marked the introduction of Christianity into Rehovot. The apse of the Central Church had already been excavated in 1979, along with parts of the bema, the aisles, and the rooms beside the apse.6 In 1986, excavation of the bema was completed, larger portions of the aisles were cleared, and the side rooms were excavated completely down to their lower substructures. The church had clearly gone through two phases. The earlier, of unknown date, has thus far been exposed only in fragments: two column bases, one in each of two stylobates, a column drum, and fragments of painted plaster that were discovered in the fill underneath the floor of the later church (in L. 418, 420 and 421). Portions of the southern wall of the earlier basilica were also revealed; no details were found of its plan and dimensions, but it is clear that it was smaller than the later one. The later, better-known church was built in the mid-sixth century, according to an inscription cut into the marble floor of the nave, just in front of the chancel screen (PL 23:B). The inscription does not survive complete, but fortunately the date is clear: 445 (or 449) of the era of the Provincia Arabia, 550/551 CE. (or 554/555 CE.) (see Appendix, pp. 126-127). The external width of the church is 16.1 m. Its length is unknown, as are the plan and dimensions of a chapel attached to the basilica to the south. The chancel and the nave were paved with grey marble flagstones, most of which were robbed out after the church was deserted; the aisles were paved with dressed limestone slabs. The Central Church was situated on the eastward slope of a hill. In order to level off the church, its eastern part was set on substructures. In 1986 we excavated the substructure storey down to its foundations beneath both side rooms of the church. The side rooms themselves formed part of the church and functioned in the liturgy. Both the side rooms and the storeys beneath them were roofed with arches supporting long roofing slabs. The arches of the substructure storey were completely preserved. In the lower part of the southern room (L. 409, 417) a portion of the outer wall of the earlier basilica came to light (W. 103). In the fill beneath the floor of this room (L. 416), we found early Roman and painted Nabataean sherds. Within the rooms of the church, many architectural fragments were discovered, some adorned with Christian motifs. These included fragments of marble posts and panels from the chancel screen and a complete column from the ciborium, the existence of which was already demonstrated in 1979. The smaller finds included fragments of bronze candelabra, glass lamps, wooden artefacts, and coins. 6 Tsafrir-Excavations, pp. 14-16.</page><page sequence="8">124 Y. TSAFRIR AND K.G. HOLUM IV. AREA E ? THE ATRIUM OF THE NORTHERN CHURCH Work conducted in this atrium during the 1986 season was on a small scale.7 More parts of the pavement of limestone slabs were uncovered in the south eastern sector of the atrium, not far from the gate of the church. Many of the flagstones had been robbed out after the church was destroyed. The most important find was an early Arabic inscription in Kuflc letters, on a limestone slab 0.32 0.59 m., that was still in situ, oriented towards the south, the direction of the qibla. The same slab also has an (earlier) Christian cross and several Greek letters incised on it. The Arabic inscription consists of five short lines, which were deciphered and prepared for publication by Yehudah Nevo.8 It is an invocation addressed to Allah by a certain Hakim ibn Abi Asma', the officer (mawla) of 'Abdallah, the son of 'Amr ibn al-'??. This text is of utmost importance, being the earliest inscription of the time to mention 'Amr ibn al-'A?, the famous conqueror of Palestine in the 630s. It is clear that it cannot date from later than the end of the seventh century. Thus we have more evidence for the desertion of the Northern Church by the Christians not very long after the Arab conquest. V. AREA ? THE CEMETERY (Fig. 5, PI. 23:A) The Byzantine cemetery extends over several low and broad hills to the north of the town. The 1975 and 1979 seasons had already included some examination of this sector. In 1986 we undertook much more extensive exploration, to emphasize not only mortuary archaeology ? burial customs, tombstones and their arts, inscriptions, and grave goods ? but also the physical anthropology of the skeletons within the graves. Dr. Israel Hershkovitz and his associates set up a field laboratory at the site for preliminary conservation and registration of the skeletal remains before transporting them to the regular laboratory for analysis. In the 1986 season 34 burials were excavated in several sectors (TA-TD) chosen at random across the cemetery, with no fewer than five or six tombs in each sector. This work revealed a general similarity among the burials. As a rule a 1 2 m. pit was dug to about 0.6-0.8 m. below ground level until the grave-diggers reached the chalky bedrock, which they then excavated to about 1.0-1.2 m. below the surface, forming a cavity roughly 0.3 m. in depth that fitted the dimensions of the body. After the deceased had been laid in the cavity, it was covered with flat limestone slabs. The pit above was then filled with chips of chalk and earth, usually material taken from the pit. The grave was marked on the surface by stones embedded in the earth surrounding its perimeter. At the western end of the rectangle thus formed, a tombstone was installed, carved from limestone and oriented to correspond to the direction in which the body had been laid.

HOLUM case the orientation of the deceased was north-west ? south-east, with the head placed towards the north-west as if looking eastwards. The usual type of tombstones at Rehovot are carved in an anthropomorphic shape. A flat slab is cut to indicate shoulders and the rounded shape of a human head. A cross is inscribed in the position of the face, and either surrounding the cross or below it, on the upper part of the shoulders, the name of the deceased is incised and sometimes the date of burial. Many inscriptions of this type had already been discovered at Rehovot early in the twentieth century, and only a few more were added from our excavations. Anthropological examination of the skeletons is now in progress. The physiognomy of the Rehovot population, its diet and health, and the average lifespan are being investigated.9 Furthermore, an attempt will be made to determine the origins of the Rehovot population. Were the inhabitants the descendants of the Nabataean Arabs, immigrants who arrived in later centuries from the Arabian peninsula, or were they newcomers from northern Palestine or from even farther to the north? This question can now be addressed with the aid of skeletal material, while in the past the only relevant information came from literary evidence and the ?nomasticon of peoples of the Negev known from burial inscriptions and the Nessana papyri. APPENDIX: A DATED INSCRIPTION FROM THE CENTRAL CHURCH (Fig. 6, PI. 23:B) Two broken slabs of grey marble found in L. 415 contain the central portion of a dedication in three lines. The preserved width of the two fragments is 38 cm., their height is 38 cm., and their thickness 2.6 cm. The slabs were found just in front of the bema steps. Although not found in situ, they had no doubt formed part of the original pavement of the nave. Fragments of similar slabs did appear in situ near the bema steps, and the imprint of the flooring slabs survives in the mortar bedding. Hence the inscription dates the second-phase flooring, and probably the second phase of the church itself. The inscription, incised with a sharp tool, uses a square alphabet except for o and , with ligatures for and e and an abbreviation for a . The extended central stroke of A and M is common in the sixth century Negev, as is the interchangeable use of and o. Letter heights average 2.5-3.0 cm., but in line 2 they are only 1.5 cm. high. 9 For previous work at Rehovot, see I.

The restoration of the inscription is based on three parallels found in the Negev, two of them dedications from the North Church at Shivta.10 Line 1: The restoration of the cross and e are certain, indicating that about seven letters have been lost at the left side of the inscription. The epithets a a and a , especially when appearing together, indicate that the first dedicator mentioned, whose name has been lost, was a bishop.11 Line 2: The name Stephanos is very common in the Negev and throughout Palestine; most probably a patronymic followed, perhaps the genitive of the name , found twice at Nessana.12 Also lost in this line is the title of the second dedicator, perhaps e ? e , e , a or a . The man may also have belonged to the civil administration as ? a (vicar), but an ecclesiastical or clerical title is more likely. The verb form e common in Negev dedications must have concluded this line, since there is no room for it at the beginning of the next line. Line 3: The certain restoration of continues the dedication formula. The third numeral in the date is either e (= 5) or (= 9). According to the era of the Provincia Arabia used in Rehovot, the inscription was therefore written in September 550-September 551 or September 554-September 555. The year of the indiction and a cross probably concluded the inscription. 10 A.
