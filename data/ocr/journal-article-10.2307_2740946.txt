The Melanesian islands east of New Guinea and those of western Micronesia comprise a series of mostly discrete arcuate archipelagoes, some with active vulcanism, while eastern Micronesia and Polynesia consist generally of much smaller and more dispersed islands of basaltic and/or coralline construction (Thomas 1967). In the case of Poly- nesia, especially, one can only be impressed by the magni- tude of distance and degree of isolation: for example, the 15 Cook Islands together cover only 93 sq. mi., and they are dispersed over 850,000 sq. mi. of ocean. Lonely Easter Island is 1,100 mi. from Pitcairn Island, which in prehistoric times was its nearest inhabited neighbour. This article is intended to give a brief summary of present knowledge of the prehistory of this region and to raise what seem to be important issues for discussion. Its orienta- tion is intentionally culture-historical, for very few attempts have been made to review this topic for a nonspecialist readership in recent years (Suggs 1960, Golson 1972 a). The prehistory of New Zealand is not discussed, except in passing. THE PEOPLE Through a large part of the 70,000 years since the beginning of the fourth glaciation, and until some 8,000 years ago, New Guinea and Australia were joined by the emergent Sahul Shelf, and together offered an area of approximately 4,000,000 sq. mi. for human settlement. At no time during the Pleistocene was Indonesia ever a single land mass, for sea gaps persisted between Bali and Lombok (Wallace's Line) and between the islands of eastern Indonesia and West Irian. The first men to cross these gaps were evidently of the Homo sapiens grade approaching the modern form PETER BELLWOOD is Lecturer in Prehistory at Australian National University (Box 4, P.O., Canberra, A.C.T. 2600).

His research interests are Southeast Asian and Pacific prehistory.

On genetic and phenotypic grounds, the people of Australia and most of interior New Guinea may be classified as Australoids, whose ancestors moved into the area from Indonesia prior to the Holocene expansion of a Mongoloid phenotype into the latter area (Coon 1966). Since the early Holocene, New Guinea and Australia have been culturally and geographically separated, and New Guinea today contains diverse populations, some in parts of the interior of dwarf stature. In general, the peoples of New Guinea, and at the present time most of Melanesia, are characterised by dark skins, dark woolly or frizzy hair, and varied stature. Until 5,000 or so years ago, the vast area of Oceania east of the Bismarck Archipelago was, on present evidence, devoid of human settlement. Some rather limited evidence suggests that by the 2d millennium B.C. populations ap- proaching the present Southern Mongoloid phenotype were established in parts of northeastern Indonesia and the Philippines (Jacob 1967; Fox 1970:70-71). Between 3000 B.C. and A.D. 1000, descendants of these peoples gradually settled the whole of Oceania, although not without extensive contact and intermarriage with the existing Australoid populations of eastern Indonesia and western Melanesia. Individual Polynesians and Micronesians of today can therefore be placed at various intermediate points along an Australoid-Mongoloid cline. The Melanesians who inhabit the island chains from the Solomons eastward to Fiji are of highly varied but basically Australoid phenotype (Australoid in this sense does not imply direct similarity to an Australian Aborigine, but has a much wider connotation implying a high degree of common ancestry), with phenotypically intermediate groups in Fiji, parts of the New Hebrides, and some other areas who share many physical traits with the Polynesians (Howells 1970, Pietrusewsky 1970). Melanesia is very much a racial mosaic, and a historical explanation of its diversity is one of the most difficult and elusive problems facing Pacific anthropology. To complicate matters further, there are numerous Polynesian outlier colonies scattered on small islands throughout eastern Melanesia and even in the southern Caroline Islands (Davidson 1970). Genetic studies (summarised in Kirk 1965, 1971; Sim- mons 1962) suggest that the earliest Australoid settlers in Australia lacked the alleles for blood group B in the ABO system and S in the MNSs system, but the situation in New Guinea is much more difficult to interpret. Australians and New Guineans have retained fairly close similarity in gene frequencies, while Polynesians have retained some degree of similarity to the American Indians. The latter situation is not altogether surprising, since the Indians are basically Mongoloid peoples, and it does not necessarily mean that the Polynesians came mainly from the Americas.

Geographical divisions and Austronesian language divisions in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Indeed, recent recognition of the importance of the founder effect at the small-scale tribal level suggests that gene frequencies may never give very reliable results on ancient human migrations. The genetic evidence cannot be ignored, however, for it strongly suggests that Negroid or Caucasoid settlement in Oceania in prehistoric times is very unlikely and that the Pygmies of New Guinea are unlikely to belong to a Negrito race of separate origin from the other inhabi- tants of Melanesia. CULTURES OF THE ETHNOGRAPHIC PRESENT The prehistory of Oceania is very much the prehistory of the present Oceanians, and Oceanic archaeology is meaningless if one ignores the ethnographic record. Of all the Oceanic peoples, the Polynesians are culturally and linguistically the most homogeneous, and stem mainly from an isolate located most probably in the Tongan Islands in the late 2d millennium B.C. (Groube 1971). Apart from a number of specialised atoll societies, Polynesian social structure is basically patrilineal and genealogically ranked, and elaborate hierarchical systems of rank and class were developed in the chiefdoms of the Hawaiian, Society, and Tongan Islands in particular (Goldman 1970). In Micronesia, matrilineal societies dominate most areas apart from Yap and the Gilberts (Mason 1968). However, the ethnic pattern in Micronesia may reflect more varied origins, probably from the Philippines for the Palau and Marianas Islands and from eastern Melanesia for the Carolines, Marshalls, and Gilberts, while the Gilberts in particular have been in more frequent contact with Polyne- sia. Melanesia is both racially and culturally the most diverse area of all. Hereditary ranking is present in some areas, especially Fiji, where fairly large chiefdoms may have developed in prehistoric times. But in many areas of Melanesia, especially in the west and in New Guinea, status is achieved rather than inherited, with resulting "Big Men" entrepreneurs. The large islands of western Melanesia support complex mosaics of ethnic groups, mostly patrilin- eal in the New Guinea Highlands, but with many matrilineal groups in island Melanesia. Individual trade partnerships tend to be very important, and elaborate trade networks transcending ethnic boundaries are well known, especially from Papua, the New Guinea Highlands, and the Solomons and Bismarcks-the kula cycle of the Massim district is perhaps the best known, after Malinowski. Throughout Oceania, subsistence economy (Brookfield and Hart 1971, Yen 1973) is based on root and tree crops, propagated by vegetative rather than seed methods, to- gether with fishing in coastal areas and some pig husbandry and hunting. Pigs, dogs, and fowls were the only domesti- cated animals in prehistory, and all three were not present everywhere. Cereals, domesticated herd animals, and a large number of technological innovations such as metal-working, the wheel and the plough, the loom (except in the Carolines, eastern Solomons, and Banks Islands), and masonry dwell- ing construction (except on Easter Island) were absent. The major root crops are all of Indo-Oceanic ancestry, the main ones being varieties of yams and aroids. Tree crops include breadfruit, banana, coconut, pandanus, paper mulberry, and many others of both edible and technological value. The sole important Andean cultigen, the sweet potato, was grown only in parts of the culture area of Eastern Polynesia (Hawaii, Marquesas, Society, Easter, and New Zealand) in prehistoric times (Dixon 1932). Over most areas, cultivation techniques are based on shifting horticul- ture for root crops, although there are quite elaborate terraced irrigation systems for taro in some areas, such as New Caledonia and parts of Polynesia. In parts of the New Guinea Highlands, drained plots on a grid pattern for sweet potato (a recent introduction here) support populations of up to 600 persons per sq. mi. in favourable areas. Without their voyaging technology, Oceanians would never have settled their island world. Single-outrigger canoes are in use in most areas, and double- or multiple- hulled canoes were once used for long voyages, especially in the Papuan Gulf and the Fiji-Tonga-Samoa area. The 10 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="3">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA largest Fijian canoes were up to 100 ft. long in the 19th century and could transport 300 men (Tippett 1968:91). Ancient methods of direction-finding are now mostly lost, but the atoll dwellers of Puluwat in the Carolines are capable of making frequent voyages to Truk, 150 mi. away, using only the rising and setting positions of stars, reef positions, wave direction, and homing birds (Gladwin 1970). Such methods were probably once in use over all Oceania (Lewis 1972), but even in Polynesia return voyages of more than 200 mi. were very infrequent, and in this respect many traditional accounts of Polynesiarf prehistory may be con- sidered to be exaggerated (Sharp 1963). LANGUAGES Although no exact figures are available, it is possible that over 1,000 different languages are spoken in Oceania, a situation which reflects the high degree of cultural frag- mentation in the area. Over most of New Guinea, and in scattered pockets in eastern Indonesia, the Bismarcks, and the Solomons, 700 or more languages are grouped into several different phyla and collectively designated Papuan or Non-Austronesian. The remaining languages of parts of coastal New Guinea, most of island Melanesia and Indonesia, and all of Polynesia, Micronesia, and the Philippines (together with parts of Southeast Asia and Madagascar) belong to the Austronesian phylum. The diversity of the Non-Austronesian languages sug- gests great time depth. Since New Guinea has been settled for possibly more than 30,000, years, it may be that their ancestry goes back to the beginning of settlement and that this time span has removed any demonstrable connection with the languages of Australia. However, recent work has tended to dispel any notion that they evolved entirely in static isolation, and the majority of the Non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea, apart from some large groups in the Sepik district and on the north coast of West Irian, have been grouped into a single Trans-New-Guinea phylum (Wurm 1972a). It seems that speakers of ancestral languages within this phylum expanded from eastern New Guinea, perhaps through the Markham Valley, into the Highlands and southern districts from about 10,000 years ago. Whether this expansion began outside New Guinea is not at present clear. Non-Austronesian speakers have also settled parts of island Melanesia as far east as the Santa Cruz group, and this expansion could well belong to a pre-Austronesian period of antiquity. Within the 400-500 languages of the widespread Aus- tronesian phylum (fig. 1), a number of linguists recognise two major subgroups-Western Austronesian and Oceanic (Grace 1968). Our interest here is in the Oceanic subgroup, which includes all the Austronesian languages of island Melanesia, many of those of coastal New Guinea apart from Geelvink Bay and the Vogelkop Peninsula, all the languages of Micronesia apart from Palauan and Chamorro (Marianas), and all the languages of Polynesia. The Oceanic languages total about 300 and are most diverse in the New- Guinea-Bismarcks area, where a time depth of over 5,000 years is indicated by glottochronological dating. Other diverse languages are present in eastern Indonesia in the Sulawesi-Moluccas-Vogelkop area, and the initial Aus- tronesian settlement of Oceania may have originated from somewhere here. Dyen (1965) has suggested that the degree of diversity shown in the East-New-Guinea-Bismarck- Solomons area indicates that this may be the origin area for the whole of the Austronesian family, but this view is hard to equate with the archaeological and physical anthropological evidence, slim though it may be. Other linguists have tended to attribute this diversity to long-term borrowing from Non-Austronesian languages, the high degree of social and political fragmentation, and the relative frequency of bilingualism in an area as ethnically diverse as western Melanesia. The Austronesian languages of the Solomons, New Cale- donia, and the southern New Hebrides are also diverse and little understood genetically and have a glottochrono- logical time depth of over 4,000 years. Of special importance is the probable existence of an Eastern Oceanic subgroup (Pawley 1972) as a branch of Oceanic, which includes the languages of parts of the southeastern Solomons, the central and northern New Hebrides (excluding Ambrym and Malekula), Banks, Fiji, and all of Polynesia and the Polyne- sian outliers. Future work may include all the Micronesian languages apart from Palauan, Chamorro, and, possibly, Yapese and Nauruan, but much more research is required in this area. The formation of a Proto-Eastern Oceanic language or chain of languages evidently took place in eastern Melanesia, possibly in the southeastern Solomons or New Hebrides, and its differentiation may have begun as early as 4,000 years ago. The inclusion of Polynesian with eastern Melanesian languages in this subgroup is a matter of no small significance for any consideration of Polynesian origins. Recent work on the fairly homogeneous languages of Polynesia suggests settlement of Tonga and Fiji-before 1000 B.C. and formation of a Proto-Polynesian language in the Tonga-Futuna area. Subsequent Polynesian linguistic splits are fairly well established. The first, in the mid-Ist-millen- nium B.C., separates Tongic (Tonga and Niue) from Nuclear Polynesian (probably first located in Samoa). Nuclear Po- lynesian split into Samoic (Samoa and the majority of the outliers) and Eastern Polynesian with the first settlement of Eastern Polynesia early in the 1 st millennium A.D. Eastern Polynesian split into Marquesic (Marquesan, Mangarevan, and Hawaiian), Tahitic (Society, Austral, Cook, some Tuamotus, and Maori), and Easter Island, the latter around A.D. 400 and the others in the later 1st millennium A.D. (Pawley 1966, Green 1966). In Polynesia, and to a lesser extent in eastern Melanesia, the sequence of linguistic splits is well supported by archaeology. Within central and eastern Micronesia the greatest linguistic diversity seems to be in the eastern Carolines, suggesting earliest Eastern Oceanic settlement in these areas. In western Micronesia, the Palauan and Chamorro languages are probably from Indonesian or Philippine sources. These inferences concerning genetic relationships be- tween languages, derived from lexicostatistics and gram- matical studies, are of crucial importance for the archaeol- ogist. In addition, reconstruction of aspects of the vocabu- lary of Proto-Austronesian suggests strongly that Austrone- sian-speakers introduced horticulture (taro, yam, bread- fruit, banana, and coconut), the pig, and the outrigger canoe into the Oceanic world. PREHISTORY EARLY SETTLEMENT IN NEW GUINEA AND WESTERN MELANESIA No Pleistocene human fossil material is available from New Guinea. The only excavated Pleistocene archaeological site is at Kosipe in the Papuan Highlands (Central District T.P.N.G.), where an industry of waisted blades and flaked axe-adzes has been dated to as early as ca. 26,000 years ago in an open site possibly associated with seasonal ex- ploitation of pandanus. At approximately 8,000-10,000 Vol. 16 No. 1 March 1975 11</page><page sequence="4">years ago, edge-ground and partially polished lenticular cross-sectioned axe-adzes appear in the rock shelter of Kafiavana in the Eastern Highlands District. Outside New Guinea, the technique of edge-grinding appears in Arnhem Land at about 20,000 years ago and at Niah Cave in Sarawak at about 8,000 years ago, so New Guinea was clearly included in the early area of distribution of this important techno- logical innovation. A number of other rock shelters in the Australian New Guinea Highlands continue the cultural sequence from about 10,000 years ago and show continuity in the production of the ground axe-adzes to the present. The waisted blades disappear within the last 6,000 years, although the change appears to be very gradual and subject to fairly complex regional variation. They appear not to be made today in New Guinea, and their functions and the circumstances of their supercession are obscure. An undated industry including flaked but unground waisted blades has recently been discovered near Kandrian in New Britain, and the waisting tradition may be continued in the pecked and ground waisted axes of Bougainville and Buka in the northern Solomons. The closest outside paral- lels for the distinctive waisted blades come from undated Hoabinhian contexts in Southeast Asia. These early New Guinea industries are sometimes asso- ciated with crude pebble-tool and flake industries, in which the configuration of the cutting edge appears to have been more important in the minds of the makers than any aspect of overall shape. The recent discovery of a flake industry on New Ireland (White 1972b) which may date back to as early as 6000 B.C. provides the first definite evidence of preceramic (not to be confused with aceramic) settlement in the islands east of New Guinea. At present, the stone tool complexes in the New Guinea Highlands and adjacent areas seem to have served maintenance rather than extrac- tive functions and cannot be related as a whole to Australia, Indonesia, or any outside area, although there are increas- ing signs that future analyses will establish firmer correla- tions. The polished axe-adzes may indicate an increase in the tempo of forest clearance during the Holocene, possibly as an aid to hunting or a rudimentary form of shifting horticulture. However, suggestive evidence for horticulture does not appear until ca. 3000 B.C., when pollen analysis indicates clearance of vegetation in the Mt. Hagen area of the Western Highlands District, and the first bones of pig (not a New Guinea native) appear at Kiowa (Chimbu District) and Kafiavana. By 300 B.C., direct evidence for fairly intensive agriculture in the form of swamp-drainage ditches associated with wooden cultivation tools appears at the Manton site near Mt. Hagen, and such drainage systems may be associated with taro cultivation, Macrofossils of pandanus and gourd have been recovered, but no taro has yet been found. Intensive agriculture may thus be more than 2,000 years old in the Highlands (Powell 1970). At present, sweet potato rather than taro is the major crop in most Highland areas, especially above 7,000 ft., the approximate limit of growth for taro. The sweet potato was taken, probably by Spaniards or Portuguese, to In- donesia and the Philippines in and after the 16th century and evidently spread from there long before Europeans actually penetrated into New Guinea. Watson (1965) has suggested that the Highlands were inhabited only by small patrilineal bands of hunters and gatherers prior to this time and that the arrival of the sweet potato sparked off an "Ipomoean revolution," with marked population growth and expansion of settlement. The recent discoveries just related call for recognition of the possibility of a tradition of taro cultivation and pig-raising possibly 5,000 years old, although this may not have spread through all Highland districts (Brookfield and White 1968). Archaeologists have also long been at pains (so far unsuccessfully) to provide a chronology for an interesting series of stone mortars and pestles, the latter sometimes carved as schematic bird-shaped figurines, found especially in the Wahgi and Baiyer Valleys of the Highlands and more rarely in northeastern New Guinea, New Britain, and the northern Solomons (see map, Pretty 1965). Barrau (1965) has suggested that the mortars and pestles document an ancient phase of millet cultivation. This crop, however, is not grown in the area today, and Bulmer's (1964) suggestion that they were used for grinding nuts and seeds seems more likely. (For further information on this period, see summaries and references in Allen 1972a; Bulmer and Bulmer 1964; Golson 1971 a, 1972b; White 1971, 1972a.) AUSTRONESIAN SETTLEMENT The artefacts and sites just discussed are unlikely, on general grounds of date and distribution, to be associated with Austronesian-speakers. While one cannot correlate artefacts and languages precisely in prehistory, there are good circumstantial grounds for suggesting that Austronesians were responsible for the introduction of pottery and po- lished stone adzes, especially of quadrangular cross-section, into Oceania. (The term "adze" implies a single bevel, as opposed to the double bevel of an axe.) Melanesian pottery production today is generally confined to Austronesian- speaking areas (with significant exceptions such as the Sepik district of New Guinea), and the main manufacturing techniques are modelling, ring building, coiling, and use of the paddle and anvil; firing is under an open bonfire, the kiln being unknown (Palmer 1972). Adzes of quadran- gular or trapezoidal cross-section generally become more frequent with the earliest pottery in Melanesia and dominate Austronesian prehistory in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Polynesia. In Melanesia, the earlier New Guinea fashion for lenticular cross-sectioned adzes eventually dominates as far east as Fiji, but quadrangular-sectioned adzes are importantly associated with the Lapitoid ceramic series (see below). Micronesian adzes have been little studied and are generally absent on the atolls (except in shell), and Mi- cronesian pottery is confined to the western fringes (Palau, Yap, and the Marianas). Some of the earliest settlements of the islands of eastern Melanesia, from the southeastern Solomons to Tonga, are closely associated with the spread and development of what Golson (1971b) has termed the Lapitoid ceramic series, named after the site of Lapita on the west coast of New Caledonia. Lapita pottery was first found on Watom Island off New Britain in 1909, but its significance was not recognised until the late 1950s. Lapita sites have been excavated, mostly during the past ten years, on Watom Island, on Ambitle (off New Ireland), in the Santa Cruz group, on Efate and Malo (New Hebrides), on New Cale- donia and the Ile des Pins, on Viti Levu (Fiji), and on Tongatapu. Radiocarbon dates place the series from the later 2d to the end of the 1st millennium B.C., when it generally disappears in Melanesia. The Lapitoid aspect represented in Tonga is generally regarded as early Polyne- sian, and from here, or a nearby centre, makers of Lapita- derived plain pottery settled Samoa about 300 B.C. or earlier. The eventually aceramic pattern of Polynesian culture is a product of sequential isolation first in Tonga, then in Samoa, then in other Eastern Polynesian groups. Lapita pottery is sand- or shell-tempered;,- and tempers and possibly whole pots may have been traded over long distances (Dickinson and Shutler 1971), together with obsidian, which was traded up to 2,000 km in one attested case (Ambrose and Green 1972). The decorated ware consists often of flat-based and sometimes carinated bowls, 12 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="5">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA with decoration mainly around the upper surface. Decorat- ed ware is usually infrequent, however, and round-bot- tomed plain bowls or ovoid pots with distinctive rim forms normally appear to predominate, although it is only very rarely that whole pots have been reconstructed. The deco- ration includes an incised and sometimes an applique component, but the most distinctive component is a unique form of toothed or "dentate" stamping, made with an unknown tool which may have resembled a small comb or tattooing chisel. The motifs (fig. 2) comprise horizontal banded arrangements of triangles, crescents, ropes, meanders, and stamped circles (Specht 1968) and even extend to schematic anthropomorphic representations (Green 1973:fig. 3). Manufacturing techniques include slab-building, coiling or ring-building, and paddle and anvil finishing; sometimes a red slip may be present, together with a white calcareous infill to emphasise the designs. Lapita pottery seems likely to be attributable to a mobile group of Austronesian seafarers and traders who were expanding in central and eastern Melanesia after 1300 B.C. The degree of emphasis on dentate stamping appears to be a localized Melanesian development, but the general Lapita combinations of dentate stamping, circle stamping, red-slipping and lime infill, carinated body forms, and absence of painting, cord-marking, and tripod feet quite clearly link it with similar and contemporary ceramics in the Marianas (Spoehr 1957), in the Batungan sites on Masbate in the central Philippines (Solheim 1968: fig. 5), and in the Yiuan-shan culture in northern Taiwan (Chang 1969). There are no grounds at all for deriving the Lapita ceramic style from anywhere on the Southeast Asian main- land; there are clearly no close similarities with the Lung- shanoid cultures of mainland China or Taiwan (Chang 1969), and the well-known Sa-huynh site in South Vietnam (Parmentier 1924, Solheim 1959a) may perhaps be regard- ed as a record of Chamic settlement in South Vietnam from the Island Southeast Asian jar-burial province of the 1st millennium B.C. The Austronesian languages themselves have no traceable mainland origin, and, to keep closely to the point, there are no grounds for seeking possible extra-Melanesian connections for Lapita pottery beyond Taiwan, the Philippines, and northeastern Indonesia. It is possible to trace Yiian-shan origins back to the earlier cord-marked and incised pottery of Taiwan, and this of course in turn may have a mainland origin (Chang 1969:chap. 10), but the relevance of this connection for Lapita origins remains to be demonstrated. Artefacts associated with Lapita pottery include a range of shell adzes, arm rings, and necklace units, together with stone adzes of quadrangular, lenticular, or plano-convex cross-section. It should be emphasized that the Lapitoid series is polythetic (Clarke 1968:37) and by no means all sites share all items mentioned. A ceramic style approximately contemporary with Lapita, with related designs but without dentate stamping, has been discovered recently on Buka in the northern Solomons (Specht 1969). Along the coast of the Papuan Gulf, near Port Moresby and on Yule Island, a red-slipped ware with dentate stamping and incised designs has been found to date back some 2,000 years. The latter pottery is not classified as Lapita, but it has been suggested that it may correlate with the Austronesian settlement of southern Papua (Allen 1972b, Vanderwal 1973). However, the de- tailed relationships of these styles with Lapita remain to be determined. Although no published analyses of Lapita skeletal materi- al are available, one might hazard the guess that the makers will be close to the Polynesian phenotype, on the grounds that the Polynesians appear to be their direct and isolated descendants. This raises the fundamental problem of why A \ ^ L B C D E F 2 5 FIG. 2.

The approximate ceramic chronology of Island Melanesia and Polynesia. the eastern Melanesians and Polynesians, who form a linguistic continuum and to a lesser extent a cultural continuum, should be physically so different. It is of course easy to overemphasise the physical differences, but it is impossible to assume that the eastern Melanesians and the Polynesians are both direct and totally isolated descendants of a single founder population. The physical differences are definite and significant, and at present one could hypothesise that a segment of the people who made Lapita pottery formed a number of relatively endogamous sea- borne trading groups who in most of Melanesia (with the possible exception of Fiji) coexisted with the direct ancestors of the present Melanesians, already in the area (Green 1973). The influence of Lapita pottery seems to disappear generally at about the time of Christ, and it may be that in Melanesia its makers lost their distinctive life-style and simply became absorbed into the resident Melanesian pop- ulations, while in Polynesia their descendants lost the ceramic art but retained many other aspects of the original culture and the physical type. We are still left, of course, with the problem of where the makers of Lapita pottery came from in the first place. Ceramic features would suggest northern Island Southeast Asia, as noted above, and so would the physical type of the present Polynesians; but 14 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA then why is it that the Polynesians speak languages which are very clearly derived from eastern Melanesia and not in any direct way from Island Southeast Asia? Apart from suggesting that small founder populations might have adopted the languages of neighbouring Melanesian groups (and this need only have happened once), one is still forced to conclude that the question of foundation relationships between Polynesians and Melanesians is still attended by some degree of mystery. Micronesian ancestry may be similar to that of the Polynesians, but the absence of archaeological work in central and eastern Micronesia proper would make further surmise of little use at this point. The foregoing paragraph may have put the cart before the horse by stating possible answers to a major problem before all the evidence has been considered. However, if the reader has the problem in mind, then what follows may have a clearer significance. Melanesian ceramic prehis- tory through the past 2,000 years shows little or no survival of Lapita influence, and it is now necessary to describe the other styles which are contemporary with but apparently unrelated to Lapita (and also to any extra-Melanesian styles at present) and which appear to have superseded it in Melanesia since the time of Christ. In the central New Hebrides, particularly on the islands of Efate, Makura, and Tongoa, Garanger (1971) has reported pottery of another style, profusely decorated with incised and applique designs, which he calls the Mangaasi style after a site on Efate. This ware, which lacks the Lapita rim forms and dentate stamping, was produced continu- ously, with stylistic changes, from the earlier 1st millennium B.C. until about A.D. 1300, at which time archaeology and traditions indicate the arrival of new peoples who made no pottery and who are directly ancestral to the present inhabitants. In the 1st millennium B.C., Mangaasi pottery coexisted with Lapita and has been found together with it and predating it in the Erueti site on Efate. The earliest Mangaasi ware has elaborate handle-like appendages, some of zoomorphic form resembling elements of the New-Guin- ea-Bismarcks pestle and mortar complex. On Buka in the northern Solomons, a similar incised and applique style (Sohano style) is contemporary with and replaces the Lapita-like Buka style in the mid- 1st-millennium B.C. (Specht 1972). It appears that Sohano, Mangaasi, and the rather later incised wares of New Caledonia and Fiji may all belong to a single important series which may be contrasted with the Lapita wares (Garanger 1972:124-26), although at the present stage of research the significance of this contrast is not clear. Present research is in fact revealing considerable complexities in later Melanesian ceramics, but generally the inspirations for these seem to be quite localized. In New Caledonia and Fiji, the Lapita is replaced by paddle- impressed wares during the 1st millennium B.C., but in Fiji at least these develop continuously until the period of European contact, with the intrusive incised and applique component coming in from about A.D. 1100 (Frost 1974). In brief, throughout eastern Melanesia it is tempting to recognize an early Lapitoid series whose makers were ancestral to the Polynesians, contemporary with and even- tually replaced by a parallel paddle-impressed incised and applique series (fig. 3) whose makers have contributed substantially to present Melanesian culture and phenotype. The latter series, with its very simple pottery forms, does not have any close extra-Melanesian parallels and, despite the fact that it is earlier than Lapita at Erueti, may ultimately be of Lapitoid inspiration. For instance, at the eponymous site of Lapita in New Caledonia some of the carinated sherds are provided with carved paddle impression (Gifford and Shutler l956:pl. 12), and the Lapita pottery from several sites also frequently has incised and applique motifs. There is still much to be discovered about the origins and relationships of the Lapita and the paddle-impressed incised and applique ceramic styles and about the early economies associated with them. Agricultural evidence is virtually nonexistent for early ceramic phases, but pigs are reported from the Lapita site on Watom (Specht 1968:125) and from the mid-1st-millennium-B.c. Mangaasi-style site on Makura (Garanger 1972:82). The results of recent researches on Lapita settlement sites in the Santa Cruz Islands by Green (1973) are awaited with great interest. POLYNESIA While Melanesian prehistory is still at the basic level of establishing a time scale and solving problems of ceramic interrelationship or lack of it, prehistory in the more homogeneous and generally aceramic area of Polynesia has been longer established and has far more to show concerning prehistoric economics and settlement patterns. First, however, it is necessary to review the culture history, and the story is continued from the establishment of Lapita potters in Tonga. By the mid- 1st-millennium B.C., the only pottery being produced in Tonga was plain, and at some time around 300 B.C. makers of plain pottery moved, most probably from Tonga, to the previously unsettled islands of western Polynesia, especially Samoa (Groube 1971, Green 1967). In the ensuing period of isolation in Samoa, ceramic production was abandoned by about A.D. 300, but not before a few settlers had crossed 2,000 mi. of the Pacific Ocean to settle the Marquesas, where a few tiny sherds have been found in the very earliest levels, and possibly also the closer Society Islands, the traditional cultural centre of Polynesia. Further isolation followed by dispersal from at least these two centres then took place in eastern Polynesia (Sinoto 1970, Bellwood 1970). The early phases of Samoan prehistory show general continuity with Lapitoid Tonga, apart from a few innova- tions, including adzes of triangular cross-section (Green 1971), and a few absences amongst the repertoire of shell artefacts. The earliest known earthwork fortification in Polynesia, an area (with Fiji) which contains many such sites, lies on a ridge above the Luatuanu'u Valley on Upolu and may date from as early as ca. A.D. 300. As early as 200 B.C., inland settlement had been established on Upolu, and this suggests an important trend away from the pre- dominantly coastal pattern of Lapita settlement (see reports in Green and Davidson 1969). In later prehistory, Tonga and Samoa retained some degree of contact, and, as focal points of a Western Polynesian culture area (after Burrows 1938) including Ellice, Niue, and the Polynesian outliers, shared many traits generally absent in the more homogene- ous culture area of Eastern Polynesia. These include the exclusive use of untanged stone adzes and an absence of shell fishing gear. In Eastern Polynesia in the middle to late 1st millennium A.D., following a period of isolation in the Marquesas and possibly also the Society Islands, an Eastern Polynesian polythetic assemblage differing from but overlapping with the Western Polynesian spread to all remaining parts of the Polynesian triangle, including New Zealand. Parts of this assemblage have been recovered from early sites in the Marquesas, Hawaiian, and Society Islands (Emory and Sinoto 1964) and in New Zealand (Duff 1956), and it includes one-piece fishhooks of bone or shell, two-piece trolling hooks, tanged adzes, imitation whale-tooth pen- dants, bone reels (except in Hawaii), stone food-pounders (except in New Zealand), and open court marae with combinations of walled and/or paved enclosures, upright Vol. 16 No. 1 March 1975 15</page><page sequence="8">slabs of stone, and stone platforms (Emory 1970), together with god houses for the storage of ceremonial appurte- nances. All of these items are rare or absent in the Western Polynesian polythetic assemblage. In the isolation which followed initial dispersal into Eastern Polynesia, a number of significant cultural dif- ferences developed over the underlying homogeneity. These are especially marked in temperate New Zealand, where the first settlers were obliged to restrict their previous agricultural economy and develop special techniques for the growth and underground storage of the sweet potato in the warmer coastal fringes of the North Island. In the southern part of the South Island and in the Chathams, agriculture was not present at all. In tropical Eastern Polynesia, a variety of localised adze styles and marae developed, although a central cultural sphere including the Society, Cook, Austral, and Tuamotu Islands retained more inclusive homogeneity than the more marginal areas. Studies on the stone structures, economy, and settlement patterns of tropical Polynesia, especially Samoa, the Mar- quesas, and the Hawaiian, Society, Cook, and Austral Islands, generally indicate lightly clustered dwellings and associated marae, the latter owned by ranked ramage seg- ments. True nucleated villages are reported from Rurutu in the Australs, Easter Island, and New Zealand, but are generally uncommon (see summary and references in Green 1970, Bellwood 1971). EASTER ISLAND In 1952, when the importance of the Lapitoid series was not yet known, and the present Melanesian phenotype was believed to rule out this area as a major source for Polynesian origins, Heyerdahl (1952) published his ingenious theory deriving the Polyniesians from three sources in the 1st millennium A.D., namely Melanesia (a minor component), the coast of British Columbia (the basic Polynesian compo- nent), and the zone of primary civilisation from southern Ecuador to northern Bolivia (a white-skinned and culturally dominant component). He had already demonstrated the feasibility of a drift voyage from Peru to the Tuamotus on the raft Kon-Tiki in 1947, and in 1956 he carried out a major programme of archaeological research on Easter Island. The Easter Island sequence (Heyerdahl and Ferdon 1961, Heyerdahl 1968) provided Heyerdahl with a keystone for his theories, and he interpreted it as follows: 1. An Early Period, ca. A.D. 400 to 1100, with settlers from Tiahuanaco and adjacent areas. These settlers intro- duced a solar god named Makemake and built the first stone platforms, faced with dressed and fitted blocks. 2. A Middle Period, ca. 1100 to 1680, characterised by both New World and Polynesian elements and justly famous for the colossal statues erected on the platforms, which at this stage were altered to the basic Polynesian marae plan. (These platforms are called ahu, a word in common use for marae platforms in eastern Polynesia.) 3. A Late Period, after 1680, when the Polynesian ele- ment overthrew its overlords of New World descent, and the Polynesian society observed by the Dutch explorer Roggeveen in 1722 assumed uncontested dominance. Heyerdahl's theories have not been widely accepted (e.g., Heine-Geldern 1952, Suggs 1960). However, botanists do seem to be agreed that the sweet potato is of Andean origin, and this crop was probably present in eastern Polynesia before the beginnings of Spanish exploration. In addition, a recent series of radiocarbon dates suggests that Heyerdahl's basic archaeological sequence is correct (Ayres 1971). Most other archaeologists conclude, however, that most of Easter Island culture, including the statues, is Polynesian. The Polynesians of the Marquesas, Raivavae in the Australs, and Pitcairn also erected large stone statues, and there is a definite megalithic aspect associated with many areas of Austronesian settlement throughout the Pacific. The absence of pottery, maize, and definite South American linguistic traits on Easter Island suggests that any American contact may only have been on a small scale, but it would be unwise at present to assume that there was no contact at all (Golson 1965, Lanning 1970, Emory 1972). MICRONESIA Eastern Micronesia is archaeologically almost unknown, apart from research by Davidson (1967a) on the Polynesian outlier of Nukuoro in the southern Carolines. Davidson has established settlement of this atoll since about A.D. 1300, with an assemblage of one-piece shell fishhooks of basically Micronesian, rather than Polynesian, affinity. At this point we may mention the virtual absence of archaeological research on the many other Polynesian outliers in Melanesia, apart from the possible discovery of Lapitoid settlement on Bellona (Poulsen 1972). Linguistically, the outliers appear to have Samoan affinities (Pawley 1967), and they are now viewed as backwash settlements rather than as archaic remnants of a hypothetical eastward migration. (As we have seen, Polynesian culture is basically a development of the Polynesian triangle.) Micronesia was once, before the widespread discovery of Lapita pottery, regarded by some scholars as the main migration route from the west for the Polynesians (Buck 1964). This view receives no support today, and linguistic studies make it even more unlikely, since eastern Microne- sian and Polynesian languages appear to share a common origin in eastern Melanesia. Most archaeology has been carried out in western Mi- cronesia, an area with cultural and linguistic affinities with Indonesia and the Philippines. In the Palau Islands, a ceramic sequence has been postulated with guess dates back to 2000 B.C., and Palau archaeology is also noted for some rather remarkable terraced hills and megalithic carvings (Osborne 1966). On Saipan in the Marianas, pottery with possible Lapitoid affinities (Marianas Red) has been found in sites dating back on insecure evidence into the 2d millennium B.C. At some point in the 1st millennium A.D. a plain ceramic style takes over in association with rectangu- lar settings of large stone pillars (latte) which once formed foundations for houses (Spoehr 1957). In concept, these structures belong to the Indonesian-Philippine area, where raised pile houses are common. A sequence similar to that of Saipan has been established on the nearby island of Guam (Reinman 1968). Finally, on Yap, pottery with affinities with the later Marianas plain ware has been recovered from early- Ist-millennium-A.D. contexts, and this is followed by a local untempered and laminated ware. The origin of the famous stone money of Yap, in the form of large perforated discs of calcite dripstone quarried in the Palaus, remains undated (Gifford and Gifford 1959). CONCLUSIONS This brief survey is designed to provide a framework for Oceanic prehistory, and I do not claim to have offered any interpretations' which have not already been published in scattered sources elsewhere. The main conclusions which may be drawn are as follows: 1. New Guinea and Australia were settled before 30,000 years ago by ancestral Australoid populations, but the early eastern New Guinea industry of flake tools, axe-adzes, and waisted blades is at present without exact parallel in sur- rounding regions. This early phase of settlement may have 16 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA extended to the Santa Cruz group and perhaps even beyond to New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, although the two latter areas have no Non-Austronesian languages today. 2. In a period which probably centres on the 2d millenni- um B.C., if not before, Austronesian-speaking settlers pene- trated into Melanesia. They most probably introduced pottery, horticulture, and pigs to the islands beyond New Guinea, although there is evidence that the two latter were present in New Guinea itself as early as 3000 B.C. Cultural contact and intermarriage with Non-Austronesian popula- tions was followed by a consolidation of Austronesian settlement in the islands as far east as New Caledonia and the New Hebrides. One group of Austronesian-speakers, the makers of Lapita pottery, appears to have filled a niche as coastal traders. 3. In the late 2d millennium B.C., one or more groups of Lapita potters, who may have received relatively little influence from Non-Austronesian populations, moved east to settle Fiji and western Polynesia. Fijian traditions and the population phenotype suggest that Fiji has received later Melanesian settlers, while the Polynesians, and possibly some of the central and eastern Micronesians, are the direct descendants of the original Lapita settlers. 4. Complex population interaction and movement within the past 2,500 years in Melanesia have given rise to the present ethnic pattern of the area. The Melanesian pheno- type and such cultural factors as dominance of unilineal kinship reckoning and rarity of genealogical ranking prob- ably reflect pre-Austronesian influence. The Micronesians and Polynesians have not interacted with preceding popu- lations to the same extent and have preserved what may be an ancient pattern of hereditary ranking, together with many aspects of a Mongoloid phenotype. 5. From a large number of problems in Oceanic culture history which merit further research, I would select five as being of particular importance: (a) determination of the extent of preceramic settlement in Melanesia; (b) clarification of the relationships between Lapita pottery and contemporary styles in Island Southeast Asia; (c) clarification of the relationship between Lapita pottery and other contemporary styles in Melanesia; (d) the determi- nation of the economic basis behind the first ceramic assemblages in Melanesia; (e) the establishment of a prehis- toric sequence for the Caroline, Marshall, and Gilbert Islands. Clearly, the area which merits the most intensive future work is Melanesia. This is not a surprising conclusion: Melanesia has the largest land area, the largest population, and the greatest cultural time depth of any area in Oceania. Abstract The prehistory of Oceania is best approached through the cooperation of a number of disciplines, including archae- ology, physical anthropology, linguistics, ethnology, and ethnobotany, to name perhaps the major five. As a result of intensified cooperation over the past decade, it is now possible to write a prehistory of Oceania with which other scholars might agree at least in general terms. This paper is such an attempt, and refers particularly to the tropical islands of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Comments by WILLIAM S. AYRES Columbia, S.C., U.S.A. 29 v 74 Bellwood presents a useful but perhaps too general survey of current ideas about Drehistoric Oceania. Although this is a historical-cultural review, it also points out the kinds of problems prehistorians deal with in reconstructing Oce- anic culture history and cultural dynamics. Bellwood rightly stresses the interrelated perspectives of various branches of anthropology for solving existing problems in the Pacific. Bellwood mentions several areas for further research. All of these are pertinent; some need additional comment. Among problems for study, (a) the early development of horticulture (vegeculture and arboriculture) and (b) the relationship of very early edge-ground stone tools to horti- culture in Australia and New Guinea are both significant, because edge-grinding seems to predate the process of domestication. Bellwood does not mention the increasing tendency to reconstruct prehistoric environments and sub- sistence patterns; these are essential for understanding the prehistoric record, all the more because recent work has pushed back the time depth of occupation. He also fails to discuss ethnographic archaeology, currently most suc- cessfully pursued in Melanesia and Australia, where inves- tigations of present traditional societies provide insight into relationships among earlier material remains (see, for example, White and Thomas 1972, Gould 1971). Even in Polynesia and Micronesia, where culture change has been more drastic, data on subsistence-for example, fishing- and traditional knowledge of the environment can still be useful. Even though genetic relationships based on grammatical evidence are still not well documented for most of the Pacific, linguistic data have been extremely helpful in forming hypotheses for Oceanic settlement, especially for Polynesia (see Green 1966, Pawley 1966). Bellwood might have spelled out this evidence in greater detail. The question persists whether the Samoan and Marque- san pottery is of Lapita tradition. Although Golson (1971 b) provides some strong arguments for such an association, Green (in Green and Davidson 1969:174-75) cautions, considering the small quantity of known pottery, that it may not be Lapita. Pottery has been reported in the Marquesas not only from the earliest levels but also from later ones; Sinoto (1970:110) suggests a persistence from his Phase I (A.D. 300 to 600) into his Phase II (A.D. 600 to 1300). The continued use of pottery could eventually be found on other Eastern Polynesian islands. Bellwood seems to imply that my report (1971) on Easter Island radiocarbon dates and architecture supports Heyer- dahl's outmoded theory that the early occupation of Easter Island was non-Polynesian. I specifically stated that Smith's (1961:210-13) sequence of three periods is strengthened by the new dates, but that the sharp distinction between the Early and Middle periods (according to Heyerdahl the result of separate migrations) is now less clear, indicating continuity from early populations to later ones which are clearly Polynesian. My research in 1973 attempted to coordinate changes in portable artifacts with those recog- nized in ceremonial architecture; it provides no evidence of South American contact. Bellwood refers to "true nu- cleated villages" on Easter Island; it should be noted that these are characteristic only of the Middle Period (what I prefer to call an Expansion Phase of ca. A.D. 1000 to 1680). After this phase the general demise of the social system led to a much more dispersed settlement. Habitation patterns during Smith's Early Period, what I designate as Settlement and Developmental phases of ca. A.D. 400 to 1000, are simply unknown. An ahu/marae structure at the Tahai site, dated about A.D. 700, may indicate a settlement similar to that of the later Expansion Phase. Masonry-walled houses are not confined to Easter Island, as Bellwood suggests, but are also known from Hawaii. Vol. 16 No. I March 1975 17</page><page sequence="10">The sweet potato remains a problem for Easter Island as for all Oceania; however, this tuber was probably brought to Easter Island by the original migrants, perhaps from the Marquesas, where the chances' of prehistoric contact with South America are greater than they are for isolated Easter Island. In all, this is a timely report on an area where the known time depth of human occupation has been -tripled within the last ten years of research. by FRANCIS J. CLUNE, JR. Brockport, N.Y., U.S.A. 27 v 74 I congratulate the author on an excellent job of summariz- ing the scattered information dealing with Oceania. My one area of expertise derives from an attempt to fill one of the gaps he has noted. On the basis of a 1970 survey of the archaeological resources of Truk (Clune 1974), I carried out intensive archaeological work during May-De- cember 1973 on the islands of Truk Lagoon. At the same time, Takayama and Seki (1973) were excavating a major site on Tol Island in the lagoon. They found neither pottery nor fishhooks, and neither did I. Unfortunately, the ques- tion of the presence of pottery is not solved, since it is possible that an earlier site will have it. The dates for my archaeological material have not been determined yet; Takayama and Seki have two dates (A.D. 1620 + 70 and A.D. 1810 ? 80). The presence or absence of pottery affects consideration of the route of settlement of the Eastern Carolines: Was it from Guam or Palau (both pottery areas) or from Kusaie, the Gilberts, the Marshalls, or even farther east? by JOHN CRAIB Riverside, Calif., U.S.A. 27 v 74 As an overall introduction to Oceanic prehistory, Bellwood's paper is quite successful. As he mentions, however, because it is written in such general terms, no new insights have been offered. I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the relatively sparse attention he gives Micronesia. He correctly points out that Micronesia in general has received scant attention archaeologically; however, he utilizes only a handful of possible sources. A perusal of early sources, as splendidly compiled by Chapman (1964), can result in a more compre- hensive summary of Micronesian prehistory. I wonder if the lack of work in Micronesia may result from a general preoccupation with Polynesian prehistory, involving the tracing of proto-Polynesian peoples from the Asian mainland through Melanesia (i.e., Lapita settlements) and to the Polynesian triangle. Perhaps the fact that Micronesia has not recently been considered a major contributor to Polynesian prehistory may help explain the paucity of fieldwork in this area. The last major fieldwork undertaken in Micronesia was by Davidson (1971), who excavated on Nukuoro atoll, a Polynesian outlier. This is by no means meant to criticize the work that has been carried out, but rather to suggest a cause for the neglect of this large segment of Oceania. While agreeing that Micronesian adzes have generally been overlooked, I would suggest that Bellwood's statement that adzes are "generally absent on the atolls (except in shell)" may be not only misleading but a contradiction. I feel it reflects an attitude implicit in other works (see, especially, Thompson 1932)-that if an adze is not manu- factured from stone, it warrants little, if any, attention. Actually, the atolls of Micronesia utilized the giant clam shell (Tridacna) for constructing rather large and heavy shell adzes (Buck 1932, Davidson 1971). In fact, Micronesia in general displays a variety of shell adzes, and even the larger, volcanic island groups such as Palau and Yap reveal a preponderance of shell adzes. Given the limitation of ceramic distribution in the Micronesian area, adzes (of which most are shell) may well be an important index artifact within this area in the same way as stone adzes have been important in the research of Polynesian prehistory. Finally, I would enthusiastically applaud Bellwood's sug- gestion that one of the important realms for further research would be the "establishment of a prehistoric sequence for the Caroline, Marshall, and Gilbert Islands." Unfortunately, this cry has been sounded before with little active response. by THOMAS E. DURBIN and FRANK A. YOUNG Turlock, Calif., U.S.A. 27 v 74 Bellwood should be commended for his bold attempt to present an up-to-date picture of Oceanic prehistory in a journal-length article. The employment of archaeological, physical anthropological, linguistic, ethnological, ethnobo- tanical, and other categories of data in the provision of such reviews is of great value. For too long has the emphasis of publication in this discipline been placed upon narrow, highly specialized contributions. While such summaries should be encouraged for the benefit of laymen and specialists in other areas of anthro- pology, there are some problems attendant on the brevity requirements of any synoptic endeavor. Certain areas of inquiry have generated a considerable amount of contro- versy among Pacific scholars; and while any controversy must be tailored to fit the confines of a single article, perhaps Bellwood has been too brief in his handling of voyaging technology and settlement patterns when he discounts the possibility of a tradition of long, purposeful voyaging with a quick wave of Andrew Sharp. On the other hand, he thumps somewhat for the value of genetic evidence in determining the scheme of migra- tion-in spite of Simmons's (1962:210) own conclusion after 25 years of research that "blood group genetical studies do not tell us the racial components of the Pacific peoples or their paths of migration." These criticisms are minor, however, and should not detract from the overall strengths of Bellwood's article, which includes a good summary of archaeological evidence (especially pottery) and a reasonable attempt to marshal several classes of data into a single statement. The welter of data concerning the many hundreds of languages of Oceania and the diverse human genetic and nonhuman faunal and floral distributions of the area have made Bellwood's task an especially challenging one and the results a most valuable contribution. by KENNETH P. EMORY Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.A. 28 v 74 Bellwood's digest, synthesis, and summary of present knowledge bearing on the prehistory of Oceania is most welcome. He has settled on the broad terms "Australoid" and "Mongoloid" for differentiating the earlier- and later- arriving inhabitants of Oceania, thus dropping "Negroid" and "Caucasoid" as identifying people with suchl charac- teristics settling Pacific Islands. Certainly, if we are having people coming out of Asia and Indonesia and not out of Africa or Europe, the designations "Australoid" and "Mongoloid" are practical and valid. It is a bit surprising that Bellwood can say that while Polynesians retain some degree of similarity to the American Indians in gene frequencies this does not "necessarily" mean that the Polvnesians came "mainly" from the Americas, 18 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="11">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA after he has pointed out that the American Indians are basically Mongoloid also. This means that as early prehis- toric isolates from Asia, they could both have carried away genetic traits later obscured by the spread and multiplying of people not having these traits. Therefore it would be better to leave out "necessarily" and "mainly" and say, "this did not mean that the Polynesians came from the Americas." In view of the limited space devoted to Polynesia, the amount accorded Easter Island for the presentation at some length of Heyerdahl's theory, though attempting to uphold only his basic archaeological sequence, is somewhat dis- appointing. Bellwood believes this sequence is supported by the radiocarbon dates secured by Ayres (Ayres 1971:503) but they only support Carlyle Smith's chronology of placing the ceremonial structures without large statues before A.D. 1100 and those with the statues after. Heyerdahl's en- compassing of all the time from A.D. 1100 back to a radiocarbon date of A.D. 400 in one period and his claim that this period belongs to a pre-Polynesian occupation by Indians from the Andean region of South America have not been substantiated. Although eastern Micronesia remains archaeologically little known, the ubiquitous adzes of plano-convex cross- section of Island Asia and Melanesia are well reflected in the tridacna shell adzes of central and eastern Micronesia, revealing participation in the adze tradition inherited by the early Polynesians. by JACQUES FAUBLtE Paris, France. 29 v 74 I accept Bellwood's propositions, but would ask some questions and offer some suggestions. Since the word "Australoid" means both Australian and New Guinean, would it not be advisable to say "Guineo- Australoid" instead? The' linguistic boundary between Australian and New Guinean languages is clear (Wurm 1972). Edge-grinding is a technical fact without any connection with chronology. I think that this technique arises from the grinding of shells. In the examination of "Lapita" ceramics, Bellwood stresses the Kalanay type, overlooking other sites (Solheim 1959c) and also the shape of the vessels, which is as important as the designs. Men of distinct physical types were found together in the caves of Indo-China (Patte 1958). For each race, there is a climatic optimum, which favors, for example, light- skinned people in Polynesia and dark-skinned ones in Melanesia. I think that this article is a very useful survey of Oceanic prehistory. by J. L. FISCHER New Orleans, La., U.S.A. 15 v 74 Bellwood has provided a useful summary of a variety of data bearing on the prehistory of Oceania. I would like to comment briefly on the question of historical inferences from language diversity and distribution. In a more or less evenly inhabited large continental area, it is a reasonable inference that the area of greatest diversity within the total area of a language family is likely to have been the longest-occupied by members of that family Such reasoning loses much of its force when applied to a scattered group of islands of irregular distribution. The diversity of languages in Oceania must be considered in relation to geography and patterns of communication. For example, Bellwood suggests that the greater diversity of languages in the eastern Carolines as compared with the western ones (excluding Yap and Palau, which may be intrusive from the west) implies that the Carolinians moved in from the east. It is correct that the Carolinian languages from Truk to Ulithi appear to be closer to each other than any of them is to Ponapean, the next language to the east of Truk. However, one obvious explanation for this is that the atoll dwellers of the central Carolines needed to move about a lot, so that there has been much communication among these islands and between them and Truk, while there was little need in prehistoric times for communication between Truk and Ponape. The atoll dwellers are in a typhoon-swept area and must periodically abandon their home islands for a time and seek refuge with relatives on less devastated atolls or on the high islands of Truk or Yap. The populations of many of the atolls are small, and young men of marriageable age must often look for a wife on another island in order to comply with restrictions on marrying close relatives. In contrast, there are few atolls near Ponape and fewer typhoons in this part of the Carolines. There are no inhabited atolls directly between Truk and Ponape, a distance of nearly 400 mi. Since Ponape and Truk are both high island groups, the best thing the peoples there could do in the event of a natural disaster was simply to stay home. One could say the same thing about Kusaie, the easternmost of the Carolines, also a high island. Traditions and cultural ties still suggest westward migra- tions at some past time in the Carolines as far as Ulithi and Sonsorol, but the greater linguistic diversity in the east may be explicable on other grounds. Probably the Carolines have been settled long enough that only thorough archeological investigation will provide useful data about the dates and sources of initial settlement. by EVERETT S. FROST Portales, N.M., U.S.A. 26 v 74 Three aspects of Bellwood's article deserve critical com- ment: the summaries of the physical anthropological and linguistic evidence, the discussion of the post-Lapitoid ceramics in Melanesia, and the problem of reconstructing the overall peopling of Oceania. The physical anthropological and linguistic evidence is covered in an interpretive (rather than descriptive) manner, partially chronological schemes being used to "explain" the distributions. It will probably be unclear to the nonspecialist from what the chronology is derived. In the case of the human evidence, it is unclear whether the dating is derived from chronometric determinations made on representatives of the populations or inferred from archaeological or other associations or interpretations. With the linguistic summary, it cannot be determined if the time framework is constructed from glottochronological or other historical-linguistic tech- niques or from archaeological inference. In both cases, a knowledge of the derivation of the chronology is necessary before a reader can judge whether the linguistic and human variation interpretations independently support the ar- chaeological reconstruction or are in fact (as I suspect) interdependent with archaeological evidence. My complaints about the discussion of the post-Lapitoid ceramics of Melanesia cannot all be directed toward Bell- wood, who is in part just reporting what others have written. Bellwood's classification of the post-Lapitoid ceramics into one large category ("incised, applique and impressed wares") and other smaller but seemingly independent, discrete categories (paddle-impressed ware, incised ware) carries on a tradition which I feel prevents a clear under- standingof the evidence. I have argued (Frost 1974:11 1-15) Vol. 16 * No. I March 1975 19</page><page sequence="12">that a close reading of the reports in which Fijian ceramic categories such as "Late horizon incised ware" and "Incised tradition" (Gifford 1951:189; Shaw 1967:13) are defined reveals that (1) each "ware" or "tradition" includes a wide variety of ceramic decoration techniques and styles different from that implied by the category name, (2) the stratigraphic associations at the type sites that are used to justify the time-space grouping of these ceramics are not all discrete (i.e., defined by geologic and/or ceramic distribution dis- continuities) and can be challenged, and (3) evidence from museum collections and recent surveys and excavations (Palmer 1971; Frost 1974:114-15) indicates that the catego- ries of ceramics apparently stratigraphically associated at the type sites are differentially associated in other contexts. Thus, the broad stylistically labeled groupings of ceramics hide within them significant variation. Changes in descrip- tion, analysis, and reporting procedures will be needed before this variation can be understood. First, groups of differentially decorated ceramics found in archaeological association should not be labeled by stylistically descriptive terms characteristic of only part of the ceramics in the grouping. Second, the stylistic variation within a cluster must be described so that other analysts can begin to build separate time-space distributions of each variant. Palmer's (1971) ethnographic and ethnohistoric work in Fiji has demonstrated ceramic design and manufacturing dif- ferences between villages. If this pattern also existed pre- historically, it can only be detected archaeologically if the tradition of gross ceramic lumping is discontinued. I suspect from my impressions of the Fijian ceramics that the post- Lapitoid ceramic traditions are quite unlike the Lapitoid tradition. The Lapita complex apparently has a great deal of internal consistency and distinctiveness in decoration technique, style, vessel form, etc., that allows an inference of cultural association between widely spaced (in both time and distance) discoveries. The post-Lapitoid ceramics have not displayed this kind of consistency, and the variants need to be treated individually until there is better control over their distributions. Bellwood's overall picture of the peopling of Oceania, broadly stated, begins with the settlement of Australia, New Guinea, and parts of western Melanesia around 30,000 B.C. or later by non-Austronesian-speaking, dark-skinned peoples with a hunting and gathering adaptation. Some time later (3000 B.C. to 300 B.C.), an agricultural adaptation develops in some areas. Bellwood hypothesizes next a dual Melanesian population of Austronesian-speakers-one part the Lapitoid population, direct ancestors to the Polynesians and of Polynesian physical type, existing as "relatively endogamous sea-borne trading groups," and the second a dark-skinned population who are "the direct ancestors of the present Melanesians, already in the area." Keesing (Keesing and Keesing 1971) presents an alternative hypothesis which seems to account for the evidence without positing a dual adaptation of coastal traders and inland horticulturalists. Like Bellwood, he sees the early population of New Guinea by dark-skinned hunting-and-gathering peoples. About 1500 B.C., he postulates, Austronesian- speakers "coming from somewhere in the Malaysian zone (either along the coastal island of New Guinea or through western Micronesia)" and carrying a Neolithic cultural pattern spread through Melanesia (p. 111, italics mine): Only after these ancestors of modern Polynesians had settled this largely uninhabited Melanesian zone, and some groups had moved from Fiji into what is now Polynesia, did large-scale movements of dark-skinned peoples into Melanesia probably begin. Presumably they were from New Guinea, where for some millennia they had been hunters and gatherers. Only with the spread of Neolithic technology into the area would populations have expanded rapidly. Whereas only a few targe istands near New Guinea had supported hunters and gatherers (as fauna thin out to the eastward), now these expanded populations could find viable ecological settings in Melanesia. Highly complex movements, interbreeding, and borrowing would have occurred in the Melanesian area. Archaeology suggests that these darker-skinned populations did not get out as far as Fiji until after A.D. 1000. Modern Melanesia, if this reading of the early evidence holds up, is thus indeed a composite-but the early culture historians, by assuming that the "archaic" layer was on the bottom, got the layer cake upside down. But any such analogy greatly oversimplifies the highly complex history of local populations. As Kroeber early suggested, malaria-which occurs in Melanesia but not Polyne- sia-may have helped to shape the physical contrasts between their modern inhabitants. Keesing's ethnological perspective, which necessitates ex- plaining the contrastive Melanesian and Polynesian social structures as well as the other evidence, has evidently given him a different view of the problem. His hypothesis accounts for the Melanesian diversity and Polynesian consistency (in linguistics, social structure, physical variation, and ar- chaeology) without postulating as intricate a model as that proposed by Bellwood. Obviously, however, it is too early in the search for Pacific prehistoric evidence to select one hypothesis over another. by ROGER C. GREEN Auckland, New Zealand. 29 v 74 Having initially involved Bellwood in writing such a review, I will say only that I am pleased and think it served the intended purpose well. Archaeology in the Pacific is in what Binford has called the exploratory phase, and, with the exception of settlement pattern and ecological economic studies, other approaches are only now beginning to'devel- op. It has been necessary first to frame a new culture-his- torical outline, solidly based on modern techniques of excavation, because older outlines, derived from a variety of ethnographic, ethnological, and archaeological sources, have proved seriously defective. The new framework is now emerging, more or less along lines Bellwood indicates. My other comments are directed to some specific points where additional material is now available. Pawley and Green (1973) have recently discussed in some detail the evidence bearing on the various Oceanic horticultural crops, the pig, and the whole outrigger-canoe complex. We have also argued, on both linguistic and archaeological grounds, for a time depth of more than 6,000 years rather than the 4,000 cited by Bellwood for the entry of speakers of the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian into Island Melane- sia. The archaeological evidence is still only suggestive, but I believe it sufficient to give serious consideration to the view that many of the coastal zones of the larger islands of Melanesia had already been settled by Oceanic-speakers before the rapid spread of people associated with Lapita pottery and other items in that cultural complex from New Britain to the New Hebrides and then to the Fiji-Tongan- Samoan area 1400-1200 B.C. The quantity of cultural information, other than from pottery, on Lapita sites, especially in the Reef-Santa Cruz area, is fairly extensive. Fortunately, the three sites excavat- ed in the Reef-Santa Cruz area represent three different points in a 700-year time span: circa 1300 B.C., 900 B.C., and 600 B.C. The sites have been ordered by ceramic analysis and the order confirmed by C14 dating. Recent obsidian hydration work by Ambrose has independently confirmed the general order of age for the middle site and probably the later one. The sites have also provided much useful economic data from bone and shell analysis, while a range of stone items and some sherds of pottery indicate a community of Melanesian village size able to acquire items from increasing distances, starting with 26 km and going 20 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="13">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA to 380-400 km and probably many more. With this as yet unpublished evidence as background, I have recently tried to define the Lapita ceramic complex more precisely, not only by its distinctive style of decoration, but also by its vessel shapes. On this basis I have also tried to separate it from what I have called Polynesian Plain Ware. The argument is based on a close analysis of the recently available evidence from Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa (Birks 1973, Mead et al. 1973, Green and Davidson 1974). There is no point to repeating the argument here. If one now wishes to examine the detailed evidence for continuity between the Lapita cultural complexes of Samoa and Tonga and the later ancestral Polynesian materials, the Samoan evidence in adzes, pottery, and other items is available (Green and Davidson 1974). It should be noted that the Lapita sherdage from the Mulifanua Ferry Berth site now amounts to thousands of sherds. Thus Bellwood is in error in inferring that sometime around 300 B.C. makers of plain pottery moved, probably from Tonga, to the previously unsettled islands of Polynesia. On the Samoan evidence, an argument for the derivation of ancestral Polynesian culture from the earlier Eastern Lapita complex is much stronger than that previously presented from Tonga. by AARNE A. KOSKINEN Helsinki, Finland. 27 v 74 In the reconstruction of prehistory, archaeology is the basic science, but cooperation between different branches of research is needed. Only when the results of research are compared with the postulations of other branches of study does the picture of the past become clear. This type of cooperation is one of the most positive features of the study of the prehistory of Oceania. Bellwood's article is a good example. The picture presented here corresponds to the results of my statistical study of Polynesian place-names (Koskinen 1973). For linguistic reasons, this type of study cannot be broadly applied outside Polynesia. With regard to the divergence of cultures, my results do not wholly agree with Bellwood's. It appears that in Eastern Polynesia certain areas of "archaic languages" (Easter, the Marquesas, Man- gareva), on the one hand, and Hawaii and the Maori area, on the other, belong together; the Tahitic group conse- quently consists only of the Society, Austral, Cook, and Tuamotu Islands, along with Rapa. This difference causes little trouble in postulating prehistoric sequences. The evidence of place-names favours long-established contacts within a cluster consisting of Western Polynesia and Fiji. Indeed, it would be odd if connections between Tongic and Samoic language areas had been totally lacking since the early divergence; many references in traditional history give the impression that many types of maritime and political relations were maintained within the cluster and also between Fiji and other island groups. The results of my calculations are not in total concordance with those of linguistic research, which place Niue and Tonga together and certain northern dialects of Tonga, together with eastern Futuna and eastern 'Uvea, in the Samoic group (see Pawley and Green 1971). At least until more evidence is collected, Niue place-names seem to include quite a lot of Samoic names, while those of Futuna and 'Uvea are markedly Tongic in type. The analysis of four categories of names-ritual, tradi- tional, kinship, and settlement-showed that Eastern Poly- nesia differs greatly from Western Polynesia in its multitude of names of ritual places (marae). Many of the Eastern traditional names seem to be relatively recent. These em- phases favour considerable communication among island groups around Tahiti, possibly about the same time that the influence of "Imperial" Tonga is manifested in place- name innovations in Western Polynesia. These phases probably occurred during the last centuries of our medieval times. When larger "states" arose on large islands, there was apparently a great change in the social life of Polyne- sians; the greater the number of people, the less the importance of kinship. These postulations have scientific value only if they correspond to the results of other branches of study. In the main, as I have indicated, they coincide with the picture presented by Bellwood. by MAC MARSHALL Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.A. 16 v 74 Bellwood has presented an admirable precis of Oceanic prehistory that serves both as a good introduction to the current state of the subject for the beginning student and as a refresher for other . Pacific scholars. Those whose interest is stimulated by this article should be advised that a more extended treatment of Pacific prehistory, comple- mentary to Bellwood's paper, will appear shortly (Shutler and Shutler n.d.). In light of the now extensive literature on nonunilineal descent in Polynesia (e.g., Davenport 1959; Ember 1959; Firth 1957, 1968; Goodenough 1955; Hanson 1971; Mur- dock 1960), I find it odd that Bellwood asserts that "Polyne- sian social structure is basically patrilineal." Surely he is aware that this misstates the facts. Bellwood observes that the eastern Carolines are charac- terized by the greatest linguistic diversity in eastern Mi- cronesia and that inferences concerning the genetic rela- tionships among these languages are of great importance for archaeologists. A paper on this issue has recently been presented by Marck (1974). While it is essentially correct to say that "Eastern Mi- cronesia is archaeologically almost unknown," there is work other than Davidson's (1967a) that might have been cited. Evans, Meggers, and Riesenberg (1965) have published C 14 dates for the Nan Madol site on Ponape, and Davidson (1967b) has presented some preliminary survey results for Ponape, Kusaie, and surrounding atolls. In addition, Da- vidson has published several other works on her Nukuoro excavations (1968, 1971). More recently, two preliminary reports of archaeological work in Truk have appeared (Clune 1973, Takayama and Seki 1973), and Beauclair (1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1966, 1967) has dealt with the archaeology of Yap and Palau. Bellwood argues that the view that Micronesia was the main migration route from the west for the Polynesians receives little support today, and I agree. It should be noted, however, that this issue has been reopened with recent publication of a book by Howells (1973). Perhaps archaeological research in eastern Micronesia during the next decade will settle this matter once and for all. by RICHARD PEARSON Vancouver, Canada. 26 v 74 Bellwood's review article is of value in bringing the materials of the last decade to a general audience. The strong relationship between Oceanic archaeology and ethnology is brought out in the delineations of trait distribution. Surely, however, we have labored this point to death; of greater significance is the potential of archaeology in the study of the development of different forms of social and economic organization and of agricultural intensification Vol. 16 No. I March 1975 21</page><page sequence="14">in the region. If we look at Lapita "culture" as an early form of adaptation to the Melanesian environment, then a number of problems emerge in the postulation of connec- tions with northern Southeast Asia, and local development becomes more signiificant than the connections beyond New Guinea. One is prompted to look to the Celebes, Halmahera, and the Sulu Sea region, not for migrant folk or potsherds, but for human ecological data. The idea that Lapita repre- sents a coastal adaptation made by groups who did not possess the total agricultural assemblage of Oceania should now be tested. I do not believe that we can completely throw out the idea of a mainland origin for Austronesian languages at this time, despite acknowledged difficulties in tracing it. In this regard, the connection with the cord-marked horizon of southern China seems extremely likely, and provides a better fit than the Yiian-shan, in terms of agricultural repertoire. With the recognition that the founder effect complicates the tracing of both physical and cultural relationships, prehistorians must now look for new ways to establish degrees of cultural similarity and difference. In contrast to the kind of particularism which pervaded earlier studies, some botanists are now working with numerical taxonomy. Perhaps we should be doing the same. In Oceania, we have been preoccupied with tracing genetic relationships because they were so obvious in Polynesia; however, we must continually be looking for other sources of cultural similarity and difference. In this regard, the recent finds at Kow Swamp, Adelaide, Australia, of pithecanthropine skeletal remains dated at about 10,000 years ago may be significant. Do they fall within the range of the Australoid type, as used by Bellwood? by HAROLD M. Ross Urbana, III., U.S.A. 31 v 74 Bellwood's article, the best contribution to oceanic prehis- tory in decades, moves that branch of anthropological science a quantum jump forward. Some nitpicking might stem from his reluctance to use all of the disciplinary arms available. Ethnobotany's absence is disappointing (see, e.g., O'Brien 1972; Barrau 1958, 1961, 1963). Biological anthropology might have played a bigger role (see, e.g., Howells 1973). The hominid fossils cited by Howells (1973) and Gould (1973) represent an "Austra- loid" population that occupied a single "Sahulland" conti- nental land mass during the Wiirm glaciation. Lastly, ethnology and comparative ethnography (Burrows 1940, Sahlins 1958, Vayda 1959, Suggs 1960, Oliver 1961, Buck 1964, Mason 1968, Goldman 1970, Alkire 1972, Chowning 1973) might, with judicious application of culture and age-area concepts (Kroeber 1931) or methods analogous to those for reconstructing protolanguages, improve pres- ent models or suggest new ones (for example, Anell 1955 and Landberg 1966 on fishhooks). The implicit (albeit tentative) acceptance that culture history begins in the Marquesas before it does in the Society Islands derives from negative evidence: the lack of dates from the Societies to match Suggs's (1961) and Sinoto's (1968, 1970). Green's (1966) and Pawley's (1966) analyses favor an earlier differentiation from Eastern Polynesian for the Marquesic than for the Tahitic languages, but they do not foreclose all other possiblities. Howells's (1973:231) presentation of Pietrusewsky's (1971) physical anthro- pological data favors the Tahitian alternative. In a purely stochastic model, voyages from Samoa should reach the Societies before the Marquesas, since the probability of a random landfall will vary inversely with the square of the voyage radius. On the other hand, the northeastward voyage from Samoa to the Marquesas would be "pherically" shorter (Vayda 1961) than the trip more nearly into the prevailing southeasterly tradewinds to Tahiti. Because I like Bellwood's interpretations so much, I would like to make a few contributions to their support. Biologically, the differences between Papuans, Austra- lians, and Tasmanians are what one would expect from the natural processes of allopatric evolution (Mayr 1963), given an ancient population something like Coon's (1962, 1965) Australoid geographic race separated into at least three populations by the submergence of the Sahul Shelf and the flooding of the Bass Strait during the Holocene. The romance of pygmies or Negritoes in Melanesia dies hard, but Howells (1973) has proved that they are merely shorter than average Melanesians (which Bellwood clearly realizes). Ethnographic research among the Baegu of Ma- laita convinced me that short stature means little more than poor protein nutrition (Ross 1973:78-80). If Greenberg's (1971) proposed Indo-Pacific Phylum (Tasmanian, Papuan, Andamanese, and maybe Australian languages) should prove to be more than just speculation, the idea of a single Australoid population in Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania sharing similar cultural traditions would seem more reasonable. As for the Austronesian stock, I have the subjective impression that Baegu is much closer to the Polynesian languages and farther from the geographically closer "other" Austronesian languages of Melanesia than linguists are prepared to admit (Ross 1973:47). Baegu phonology, much of its lexicon, and some specific grammatical features are too Polynesian to ignore. The waisted blades from the New Guinea Highlands appear, to someone who has done ethnography in Malaita and archaeology in North America, to be potential spoke- shaves for sharpening spears or digging-sticks; microscopic edge-wear analysis could confirm this. The ornamented mortar/pestle complex from New Guinea is not under- stood, but the Baegu process a variety of edible stuffs such as Canarium nuts and betel quids in this way. Bellwood's definition of the adze as a single-beveled implement may be a heuristic one; but Heider (1967a) pointed out that the Dani in Irian Jaya haft their axes/adzes either parallel or perpendicular in gay abandon, and I have noted (Ross 1970) that a Baegu ileis a knife, axe, or adze. I also suggested that cross-section and shape of the finished adze are partly a function of the characteristics of the blank and accidents of knapping and that, in northern Malaita, one can propose that polished basalt adzes of lenticular cross-section were replaced by chipped chert ones of trapezoidal or triangular cross-section (which could bear on Melanesian/Polynesian archaeological relationships). I would further stress the effectiveness of the Papuan hunter/gatherers who first settled and long occupied New Guinea (Watson 1965, Heider 1967b). The quality of the Australian adaptation to a formidable dry habitat is clear. Papuan-speaking hunter/gatherers may have been able to live well in the rain forests and expand into Island Melanesia (note reports of flint industries in New Britain and New Ireland by Chowning and Goodale 1966 and White 1972b). There are Papuan languages in an irregular pattern in the Bismarcks, Bougainville, the New Georgia group, the Russell Islands, Savo, and the Santa Cruz group (Capell 1962). Travel from New Guinea to San Cristobal requires little navigational sophistication; the widest water barriers are but 40 mi. across, enabling seafarers to see the island ahead before losing the one astern. The forests offer all sorts of plant foods; birds and edible arthropods abound, although the cuscus opossum, rats, and bats are the only mammals; and ubiquitous fringing or barrier reefs provide seafoods. Living would not be hard for hunter/gatherers, 22 C URR E N T A NT HR O PO L O G Y</page><page sequence="15">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA so long as they knew the habitat and stayed near the coast. (Such strandloopers could have settled Island Melanesia even in the late Pleistocene, but their habitation sites would have long since been drowned under rising sea levels.) Present inhabitants, like the Baegu, can survive by foraging, if they are forced to do so by natural disasters (Ross 1973:31-32). I am not comfortable with the various models (Buck 1964, Howells 1973) invoked to get Pre-Polynesians into the Fiji/Tonga homeland hawaiki unsullied by Melanesian miscegenation. The southeastern Solomons (and parts of the New Hebrides) have highly variable populations; I could select a Baegu sample (of whole families, if need be) who could "pass" as Palynesians phenotypically (Ross 1973). Might not such a small group of atypical Malaitans (or other islanders) have served as an isolated founder popula- tion, with genetic drift accentuating their already atypical characteristics, to evolve into the Polynesian phenotype in their new Fiji/Tonga habitat? Another possibility is that the early settlers of at least parts of the Solomons and the New Hebrides were not phenotypically Melanesian, but more like known Polynesians. Later immigrants, phenotypically Melanesians, perhaps better adapted for life in rain forests or malaria-endemic areas, might have come to dominate, in terms of gene frequency, subsequent populations. Two cautionary thoughts linger. First, our Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia are to an extent cartographic conventions; actual distinctions in the mid-Pacific may not be so clear-cut. Second, Pacific islands populations (like all human populations) will prove to be mixed in their origins. Much remains to be done. Lithic and ceramic relation- ships remain enigmatic. Linguistics shows that the Polyne- sians and Micronesians (at least the Gilberts-Marshalls- Carolines varieties) ought to be derived from Melanesia (Dyen 1965, Grace 1968, Pawley 1972), as does the majority of ethnobotanical evidence (Barrau 1963:1-6; Chowning 1963); physical anthropology (Howells 1973) disagrees. It is encouraging to find intelligent new attempts like Bell- wood's to make sense of Pacific prehistory. by RICHARD SHUTLER, JR. Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.A. 26 v 74 Bellwood does an admirable job of presenting a framework for Oceanic prehistory as it is generally accepted by students of this field today. He conveys the complexity of Oceanic prehistory well by the short discussion of the variety of the cultures of the ethnographic present. He correctly emphasizes the Lapita-pottery culture, at present of para- mount interest and importance in Melanesia and Polynesia. Its origin(s) and relationship to the other pottery series (paddle-impressed, incised, and applique) are both impor- tant and unclear, especially because it is contemporaneous with one or more of these types in one or more areas. One point I want to clear up is Bellwood's statement that at Erueti, New Hebrides, Lapita pottery is later than the typical Melanesian pottery. The stratigraphical position of the Lapita pottery at Erueti cannot be demonstrated, so at this time it is incorrect to say anything about its age there. A recent radiocarbon date of 1300 B.C. for Lapita culture in the northern New Hebrides (W. Goodenough, personal communication), the earliest date for the New Hebrides, probably more correctly reflects the chronological position of Lapita pottery there. Any summary paper such as this, through no fault of the author, is out of date in some respects before it is published because of the continuous outpouring of in- formation from ever expanding fieldwork. Just to mention a few recent discoveries: Decorated Lapita pottery has been found on Upolu, Western Samoa, dating perhaps to 800 B.C.; this would seem to give Samoa an equal claim with Tonga to being the cradle of Polynesian culture. The discovery of a wooden and a whalebone patu on Huahine, Society Islands, of the Chatham Island type (Y. H. Sinoto, personal communication), dating to at least A.D. 650, sug- gests that the patu, long thought to be a Classic Maori weapon, may have been made first by the Tahitians and taken by migrants to New Zealand. The possible early occupation of New Caledonia, perhaps by 10,000 B.C., cannot be overlooked, but there may be problems with the dead coral and shell samples from which the dates were obtained. The possible relationship of Lapita pottery to Marianas Red in the Marianas and arguments put forth by Howells (1973) will at least reopen the question of a possible pre-Polynesian migration route through Microne- sia. One other new development is the determination by petrographic analysis that some sherds found in Tonga and the Marquesas are from pots made in the Rewa River Delta of Viti Levu, Fiji (Dickinson and Shutler n.d.). by WILHELM G. SOLHEIM II Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.A. 8 v 74 Bellwood's article is first-class. I note only one error of fact, due to discoveries since the article was written. The finding of decorated Lapita pottery in Samoa, presumably there for several hundred years before the 300 B.C. date for the plain pottery, requires a few minor changes. I am sure that others will bring this out, so I will concentrate on the Lapita-pottery relationships between the Melanesian area and Island Southeast Asia. I am in general agreement with Bellwood's view of these relationships, though I would not include Taiwan. Discuss- ing the disruption of peoples living on the shores of the Sunda Shelf when the sea level started rising at the end of the Pleistocene (Solheim 1974), I have said, "In an area of numerous small and middle-sized islands such as portions of the Lesser Sundas, Palawan and the Sulu Archipelago, and the Kalimantan and Sulawesi coast, a certain amount of contact was probably continued, allowing diffusion of cultural traits. I hypothesize that in this general area of eastern Indonesia and the southern Philippine islands Austronesian evolved among the sea-oriented coastal-living peoples." I suggest that there were two primary periods when movement (not necessarily migration) out of this area was most active: the first during the 5th millennium B.C., bringing Austronesian-speaking peoples in some number to the coasts of northern Vietnam and South China by 4000 B.C., and the second starting around 1500 B.C. It would have been this second period of movement which brought the Lapita pottery making people from the eastern portion of the home area eastward into Melanesia, where earlier Austronesian-speaking peoples had preceded them, and the Sa-hu'nh-Kalanay pottery making peoples from the western portion to Sulawesi, Timor, Sarawak, and Palawan, where, again, earlier Austronesian-speaking peoples had preceded them. The Cham and other Austronesian-speak- ing groups of Vietnam came from the island area, and it was their ancestors who were making the Sa-hu'ynh Complex pottery along the South Vietnam coast during the 1st millennium B.C. The currents of the South China Sea run in the right direction for travelers first to drift and, once currents and winds were known, to sail from northwestern Borneo and Palawan to South China and Vietnam (Solheim, Legaspi, and Neri n.d.). One of the distinctive elements of Lapita pottery decora- tion is the use of dentate stamping. The crenelate stamping Vol. 16 No. 1 March 1975 23</page><page sequence="16">of Kalanay Complex pottery is similar in method and appearance to dentate stamping (Solheim 1959b:pl. VIIc). Dentate stamping may have been used in the Kalanay Complex pottery of the Batungan Cave Sites (Solheim 1968:fig. 51, pl. Vj) and is definitely present in the Sa-huy'nh pottery of Vietnam (Solheim 1959c: 183). Many of the similarities between the pottery of the Batungan sites and the Lapita pottery are also found in Sarawak (Solheim, Harrisson, and Wall 1961), western Sulawesi (Van Heekeren 1972:pls. 101-2; Solheim 1959c:pl. I; Mulvaney and Soe- jono 1970:pls. IVa, VIa, and XII), and Timor (Glover 1969:108-9, pl. Ia). Red-slipped pottery with impressed circles inlaid with lime may be as early as 6650 ? 180 C 14 years B.P. on Sanga Sanga Island in the Sulu Archipelago (Spoehr 1973:11, fig. 117d). Also from this site come shell adzes and gouges similar to those associated with the early Lapita pottery (fig. 180). Green (1973), reporting on sites in the Santa Cruz group of central Melanesia, reproduces a representation of a human face (fig. 3) in a style like that in Bellwood's fig. 2, motif D. Sherds from Santa Cruz, New Caledonia, and Tonga are similar in their use of small impressed circles to a sherd from the Batungan Caves (Solheim 1968:pl. VIIh). Green notes zoomorphic models of people and birds (1973:334, fig. 2); these are also found in Sa-huynh-Kalanay sites in Sarawak (Solheim, Harrisson, and Wall 1959:pl. IX) and the Philippines (Solheim 1959b:pl. V; Solheim 1964:pls. 7c, 8a). The eastern and central portions of the area I am suggesting for the Austronesian homeland are almost completely unknown archaeologically. Both Bellwood and I hope to start exploring in this area with the Indonesian Archaeological Institute during 1974-75. Reply by P. S. BELLWOOD Canberra, Australia. 6 ix 74 Before I reply specifically to points raised by the com- mentators on the article, I should very briefly indicate some new discoveries and hypotheses published in the 18 months or so since it was written. In the New Guinea Highlands, a preliminary report by Bulmer (1974) suggests that an industry of waisted blades and retouched flakes goes back into terminal-Pleistocene times in the rock-shelter of Yuku, Western Highlands District, and also claims a pig incisor from about 10,000 years ago from the Kiowa shelter, Chimbu District. At Wanlek, in the Madang District, Bulmer has partially excavated an open site with remains of curved- sided pole houses, lenticular-sectioned polished axe-adzes, tanged slate tools, and a few sherds of imported pottery, bracketed by carbon dates to between about 3600 and 900 B.C. These discoveries fill out considerably the New Guinea Highland sequence, and the pig incisor predates by a very large margin the other dated remains of this animal in New Guinea. In Polynesia, a very important find of decorated Lapita pottery has been made in Western Samoa (see comments by Green, Shutler, and Solheim), and the Samoan Islands have also been suggested as the dispersal area for the sweet potato throughout Polynesia, after introduction from South America (O'Brien 1972). O'Brien has also suggested that the sweet potato was introduced into New Guinea in prehistoric times, not through Spanish or Portuguese sources. This is an intriguing possibility, and Golson's present fieldwork on prehistoric field drains in the New Guinea Highlands may assist its evaluation. Finally, the important new book by Howells (1973) provides physical anthropological evidence which supports my division of Pacific peoples into two basic groups, although what I have called Australoid is dealt with by Howells in connection with an early racial and cultural province which he calls Old Melanesia. I would like to retain the term "Australoid," which I owe to Coon (1966), and I think that a term such as "Guineo-Australoid," suggested by Faublee, could give rise to terminological confusion. I would not at present accept Howells's view that the Polynesian racial ancestry can be traced through Micronesia, for the reason given in this article, although it is too early for dogmatism. Howells's view agrees with the physical anthropology, but not with the linguistics or archaeology. The view I have presented is diametrically opposite in its agreements. The comments made on the article cover a very wide range of topics, and extended discussion of all is not possible. I am not sure whether some of the topics which I have not treated in detail, such as ethnographic or environmental archaeology, are central to a discussion of culture-historical problems, although there is justification for the viewpoints of Ayres and Ross on this. My coverage of Micronesia was also clearly too brief for several commentators (Clune, Craib, Marshall). The hypothesis of Fischer that linguistic diversity in the eastern Carolines may not reflect time-depth in a one-to-one ratio certainly deserves consideration, al- though my own knowledge of the area is insufficient for me to comment usefully. My statement that linguistic diversity in the eastern Carolines is strongly marked was derived from Bender (1971). It is fairly clear to me now that my treatment of Easter Island-certainly one of the most controversial areas of Oceanic prehistory-was too brief and slightly misleading (Ayres, Emory). I certainly never intended to suggest that Ayres's radiocarbon dates from Easter Island support Heyerdahl's view of initial settlement from South America, and I apologise for giving that impression. Another point raised by Ayres, that the early Samoan pottery may not be of Lapita derivation, is dealt with conclusively by Green. As he, Shutler, and Solheim point out, decorated Lapita pottery is now known from Upolu. Shutler also mentions the very interesting point that some of the Marquesan potsherds may have come from Fiji. If substantiated, this is exciting evidence indeed. The importance of the results related by Green will be obvious to anyone acquainted with Oceanic prehistory, and I feel there is no need for comment. Koskinen's analysis of place names is a type of research never before applied systematically to Polynesian prehistory, although place names have of course been used to bolster hypotheses in a general way for many years. From the systematic results presented in his recent report, Koskinen is clearly breaking new ground. Marshall suggests that I misstate the facts in saying that Polynesian social structure is basically patrilineal, and his references are well chosen to support him on this. However, I would argue that there was at least a strong patrilineal bias in pre-contact Polynesian social organisation, despite the obvious tendency towards cognatic descent in recent Polynesian societies. Sahlins (1958) and Goldman (1970) will I hope provide me with some support, although I do not consider that this point requires extended discussion in the present context. Frost raises the question of the degree of independence between major sources of chronological evidence. I feel that while independence may not be total in all cases, the degree of interdependence is not such as to bias the evidence seriously. I accept his point concerning post-Lapitoid cera- mics, but consider the survey I have given as coherent as is possible at the present time, though it will doubtlessly be modified in the future. Frost's suggestion, quoting 24 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="17">Bellwood: THE PREHISTORY OF OCEANIA Keesing and Keesing (1971:111), that ancestral Polynesians settled the Melanesian islands east of the Bismarcks prior to an expansion eastward of Melanesians from the New Guinea area is for me totally unacceptable, and the com- ments by Green obviously support me here. (In fairness to Frost, I am aware that he is not asserting this viewpoint strongly, but I think the matter needs a little further airing.) Ross also mentions a possibility similar to that described by Keesing and Keesing, and suggests that resistance to malaria may have allowed incoming Melanesians to domi- nate the already settled Polynesian-like peoples. This over- looks the fact that the Polynesian-like peoples themselves almost certainly came from an area in Island Southeast Asia where malaria was also endemic, and there seems no reason why they should not have had some immunity to it as well. My own view, as given in the article, would have an early settlement of Austronesian-speaking Melanesians to as far as the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, with ancestral Polynesians spreading later. The archaeological evidence for this is admittedly slim, and the dates from New Caledonia mentioned by Shutler, which range back to 8000 B.C. (Rafter et al. 1972), are unfortunately of rather debatable significance. Nevertheless, I do not agree directly with Keesing and Keesing (or with the similar view of Wurm 1967), except perhaps in connection with the rather com- plex intermediate case of Fiji. Ancestral Polynesians (to use a rather loose term) with Lapita pottery may well have arrived first in Fiji, with Melanesian genes being introduced at the same time or later. This is a popular view, supported by Howells (1933,1973), Keesing and Keesing (1971), Green (1963), and Wurm (1967). However, I cannot accept that Melanesians did not reach Fiji until A.D. 1000. Gabel's (1958) study showed that the Melanesian phenotype is strongest in the interior of Viti Levu, and he felt that "this condition, occurring as it does in the mountainous interior, which may be regarded as a refuge area, supports the theory that the Melanesian is the earlier component in Fiji." I would therefore suggest that Lapita settlers occupied the coast of Fiji at about 1000 B.C. or before, and that Melanesian gardeners arrived at the same time or very soon after and settled the interior, as well as intermarrying with the Lapita settlers to produce a fairly homogenous physical and linguistic group ancestral to present-day Fijians. If Melane- sians first reached Fiji as late as A.D. 1000, we would surely see a much more heterogeneous pattern than is in fact present. Pearson brings up the idea that the Lapita settlers did not possess the total agricultural assemblage of Oceania. This is an intriguing hypothesis, recently advocated by Groube (1971), although I feel that Green's evidence from Santa Cruz (which he discusses) may now refute the "strandlooper" hypothesis. Pearson also believes that the Austronesian settlers of the Pacific had more in common with the southern Chinese corded-ware cultures than with the Yiian-shan of Taiwan, but I know of little evidence for the agricultural repertoire to which he refers. He asks whether the Kow Swamp burials fall within the range of my Australoid type; since I am not equipped with a statistical definition, I cannot answer this, although I fully appreciate the importance of the problem. I find myself in full agreement with Solheim's view that the Austronesians evolved in Island Southeast Asia, and I think that we are here touching on one of the most exciting problem areas for future Pacific research. From my own recent fieldwork in northern Sulawesi and the Talaud Islands, I can make the preliminary statement that much of my material should help to tie together the Philippines, northeastern Indonesia, and perhaps Melane- sia. I cannot see why Solheim has Austronesians migrating to northern Vietnam and southern China at about 4000 B.C., and I look forward to seeing his supporting evidence. Ross's paper offers a wealth of ideas. I like his idea of Papuan (Non-Austronesian) settlement into Island Me- lanesia possibly in Pleistocene times, and the mere fact that these peoples got to New Guinea and Australia in the first place shows that they were capable of crossing water. However, his view that the Polynesians may derive from a Melanesian founder population is rejected by Howells (1973:228), and I would not be prepared to accept it myself for reasons my paper should have made clear. I would suggest that the variable populations in the south- eastern Solomons and New Hebrides to which Ross refers have Polynesian characteristics because of a partial ancestry in Polynesian-like populations associated with the Lapita assemblages.
