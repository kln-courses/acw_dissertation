<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAREL ABSOLON: THE DILUVIAL ANTHROPOMORPHIC STATUETTES AND DRAWINGS, ESPECIALLY THE SO-CALLED VENUS STATUETTES, DISCOVERED IN MORAVIA A comparative study MUCH HAS HAPPENED SINCE EDUARD DUPONT, A CONTEMPORARY OF WANKEL, the father of Moravian pre-history, discovered in 1872 the first anthropomorphic statuette in the Belgian cave Trou Margrite, since the discovery in 1884 of the famous six partly steatopygous Venus statuettes of the Mentone Barma Grande cave (publicized successively by Salomon Reinach in 1898, E. Piette in 1902), and since Piette's workmen found (and smashed) the most beautiful ivory Venus statuette, called La Poire, in Brassempouy. Today we know no less than 91 statuettes found in 21 sites which mark the main migration line of the Aurignacian with its subsidiary routes from Siberia via the Ukraine, Moravia, 201</page><page sequence="2">Austria, Rhineland, Baden, Belgium, Italy and France into the heart of the Pyre- n&amp;es. These statuet- tes play no small part in the evolutionary history of human art- istic sense and they deserve their extens- ive place in scientific literature, which I cannot quote here, but which culminat- ed a few years ago in a diligent paper of Mme Passemard, a disciple of Begouen, at the University of Toulouse. In view of the great- importance of these plastic portrayals of the nude female body for the general histo- ryof culture, morals, the psychology of primitive art etc., the discovery of each of these statuettes was. a b Fig. I The classical Venus of a, b, c, d slightly 202</page><page sequence="3">c d (above) e (below) Venus I VMstonice (Wisternitz) enlarged e 4 : an event. Mo- ravia made several contri- butions. First of all K. J. Maika found seven very crudely carved statuet- tes made of mammoth metacarpals in Piedmostinthe years 1894-96. In 1927 I disco- vered together with my late friend R.Czi ek a hyperstylized Venus statuette in the Pekairna cave. Since 1925 I have establish- ed a new world record in the discovery of Venus statuet- tes in Dolni V&amp;- stonice, where fifteen distinct figures were 203</page><page sequence="4">found - naturalistic, tattoed, stylized, hyperstylized, sexual- biological, pars-pro-toto, ex- pressionistic and other sculpt- ures. To these must be added the famous obese Venus dis- covered in nearby Willendorf by the late Josef Bayer in 1908 and an unfinished crude carving found in 1924. A stylized female figure from P'redmost also be- longs to this category, found but not recognized by K hizi, correctly identified and describ- ed by Mathaeus Much in 1907. This figure, accurately repro- Fig. 2 Venus VI, Torso duced by my wife and myself, checked with an ethnological parallel from New Guinea, was submitted in a specially prepared plastic reconstruction to the meeting of the German Anthropological Society in Mainz in 193o as a sophisticated, hyper-stylized, futuristic- cubistic female figure. Moravia lies approximately in the middle of the great geopraphical chain of the dispersal of these Venuses from Lake Baikal via Moravia along the Danube and Rh6ne to the shores of the Atlantic. Through the many new discoveries Moravia has become decisive for the question whether these statuettes represent idols, fetishs, cult figures, divinities or real women with sexual emphasis. The origin of these statuettes is due to sexual-biological, erotic motives. It was purely an accident that the very first of these statuettes, Venus I, discovered July 13, 1925, is the equal of the best prehistoric female figures. It even has the advantage of being unimpaired, not mutilated like the statuette of Lespugue or the seven of Brassempouy, including "La Poire", undoubtedly the greatest of the palaeolithic Venuses, like the Willen- 204</page><page sequence="5">dorf Venus 15-I6 centimeters long. Anatomically the workmanship of Venus I is the best. Venus I (fig. i) is iii mm long, 43 mm wide in the hips, with a thickness of 27 mm. About io mm of the lower part, the feet, are broken off, so that the original total length was 121 mm. The lines of head and neck flow together, the facial traits are completely neglected, nose, mouth and ears have been left out; merely the position of the eyes is emphasized bilaterally by oblique incisions, somewhat resembling medieval vizors. The hair has been left off completely, but four oval holes have been made in the bald crown of the head, symmetrically arranged in a rectangle. I suppose that this represented a fashion, some kind of head decor- ation, and that the holes served to hold small feathers, flowers or other material. We do not know any analogy in the Palaeolithic period, but there exists a convergent ethnological parallel in negro sculpture. Idols of the Baluba and Benikanioka tribes in the Congo have four holes in their heads with flowers and feathers stuck into them (originals in the Congo Museum, Tervueren). The curvature of the collar-bone line has been executed naturalistically and anatomically correctly except for a small elevation. The arms are merely indicated bilaterally, as if pressed to the body, and merge with the bulk of the sculpture. From behind two deep grooves separate the arms from the back. The oversized but not hypertrophic breasts, shaped like goats' udders, with a strong "descensus mammarum", dominate the entire figure (as in the case of the Venus of Lespugue). Generally women have a larger left breast, which is also a characteristic of our Venus I. A prominently modelled steatomery (not steatopygy!) strikingly accentuates the sexual character of the figure in addition to the hanging breasts. Normally the circumference of the human abdomen is smaller than that of the chest; because of the steatomery this relation has been reversed in the case of our statue. Perhaps this intends to stress the pregnancy of a woman. The measurements of the chest, taken across arms and back, are 86 mm, the measurements of the abdomen, across the navel, are i17 mm. The navel is of a striking horizontal oval shape and deep. The enormous abdominal fold circles the whole body like a ring. However, it differs from the normal shape of the human abdomen, as can be seen from the pictures ofmodern Nordic women, whose folds are in a downward curve, while the Venus I has it stylized into a straight line. 205</page><page sequence="6">The Mons Veneris has been omitted, a distinction from the Venus of Willendorf. The stylized legs taper off towards the base in an elongated cone, deeply grooved in the center. In 1934 we found a statuette with exactly the same type of conical representation of the legs, so that we know with certainty how the missing part of our Venus had been modelled. There is a strikingly deep hollow in the norma dorsalis, continuing the line of the spine, leading across the anus towards the base and turning into a groove separating the legs. This feature is unnatural. On both sides of the back two "cushions" of fat are very realistically modelled. I want to mention here that in later years we found two more statuettes with identical fatty "cushions" (cf. Venus VI, torso modelled like Venus I, fig. 2). Generally speaking, our statuette is a bilaterally symmetrical, sexually accentuated stea- tomeric type, proportionally executed, comparable with the 26 year old steatomeric German woman, the North German woman and the Hottentot woman shown on the illustration a worthwhile task for somatic anthropologists. Of the further Venus statuettes found in Dolni Vestonice we shall deal only with those which are either intact or possess some theoretical interest. Venus V (fig. 3) is a flat ivory sculpture. Head and upper part of the body have been omitted, chest and abdomen form one flat surface, the belly with the navel and the large, circumlaterally grooved abdominal fold are stressed. The center of the abdomen around the navel stands out somewhat in relation to the rest of the body, which shows in particular in profile, perhaps to stress a pregnancy. Mons Veneris is represented by an exaggerated deeply carved cut, on either side of which two incisions show two lobes hanging down in a striking fashion, resembling the horrible organs of the Hottentot women known as the "Hottentot Apron". Because of the uniform color of the material these lobes do not show in the photograph as strikingly as in the original. In spite of the great apparent difference between Venus I and V we can notice great morphol- ogical, anatomical resemblances in the shape of the navel, the abdominal fold and the dorsal groove; the anatomical idea was the same. The legs, in the shape of blunt cones, are completely neglected. In the norma dorsalis there is again a deep groove continuing the line of the spine, which divides the body bilaterally. The left half of the body is ornamented with seven parallel lines of undetermined significance. In spite of the flat shape of the carving one can 20zo6</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 3 Venus V clearly recognize the intention of portraying a fat, broad Venus. This Venus V was dis- covered in 19 3 1. The year 1935 brought to light Venus XIII, (fig. 4) a strange ivory carving which formerly would have been taken for a fork, but which should be recognized-in the light of our present knowledge-as a bizarre, hyperstylized, steatomeric, pars pro toto Venus statuette. Our illustration, showing the figure from four angles, tells more than a lengthy description. The whole upper part of the body is contracted into an elongated cylinder, the abdominal part is broadly curved, without navel or abdominal fold, but with a Mons Veneris stressed by a deep groove. The legs, gently bent towards each other, therefore with sexual emphasis, terminate the statuette in points. One can see from the pierced top that this carving was worn as an amulet like the Siberian Venus statuettes. 207</page><page sequence="8">Iiiiii iiiiil ?--iiiiiii-iiiii :i- . . .- i-- --: i-: :-: -i-- ::-::: ::"'''-- - -:---:--- ::iiiiii-iiii-iiiiiii ::-:::"' ....................... i:if!k' _I: -..--. .. i ~ i~~!-;- - ~ I--::::i-i::: -_~-_::-__i:-i_ :-_:i i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ii ii l, - i_:ilii yi iiiiiiii!!iiii- li i ( iii :- ?~ i% ..... iG iiiiiiiiiiiiiii 1,, i :::::::::::i!:ill ?:: :!: :: :,~~'8~'iiipi~-iiiiiii~i:_:i:i!....!!ii~l Fig. 4 Hyperstylized Venus XIII, fork-shaped (slightly enlarged) Fortune did not limit us to this "monstrosity", but presented us with a totally different artist's conception in Venus XIV, (fig. 5) a still more impressionistic-statuette with the highest degree of sexual-biological hyperstylization. The upper part of the body with head and neck have been contracted into a shorter, abdomen and legs into a longer cylinder, with hypertrophic breasts showing a strong descensus mammarum, with the left breast larger than the right as in the case of Venus I. The whole body is decorated geometrically with horizontal and slanting lines of a significance unknown to us. This statuette shows us that the artist has neglected all that did not interest him, stressing his sexual libido only where the breasts are concerned -a diluvial plastic pornography. 208</page><page sequence="9">ii~i!i  i i'" ~ ii:  li ..... ii AOL All- ~arssg ---IBII---~J-- Ile~ Fig. 5 Hyperstylized Venus XIV. Found in 1937, stressing only the breasts (slightly enlarged) One would hardly believe that the necklace shown in our next illustration (Venus XII, fig. 6) is closely connected genetically with the Venus XIV discussed above. On September 13, 1937 we found two chains of mammoth ivory, one consisting of seven perforated rolls which will be shown in the next article, and the other of eight strange objects. Since they were found together, perforated, in a regular arrangement of smaller and larger sizes, it was obvious that they represented a type of "bead" nacklace hitherto unknown to palaeontology. The fifth bead from the left, shown on the top of the illustration, is well-ornamented. At first the shape of the "beads" was incomprehensible, but after the discovery of Venus XIV 2zo9</page><page sequence="10">we realized that each of the beads repeats the upper part of that Venus with emphasis on the breasts, the ornamentation of the fifth bead being similar to that of the breasts of the Venus. Therefore each of the beads represents a small, hyperstylized figurine of a woman, again according to the principle pars pro toto but even more radically so, leaving out the lower part of the body completely, proving that this strange necklace has a sexual-biological motivation. Venus IX (fig. 7) is also very interesting, a smaller, somewhat defective ceramic, the head broken off, obviously showing an ornamental cicatrization resembling one found today among tattoed African natives (cf. the photograph of a girl from the Bageshu tribe in the Mount Elgon territory). The remaining statuettes, including a male figure, are mostly incomplete ceramics which do not call for a description in this article (II, III, VI, VII, VIII, X &amp; XI). On the other hand, Venus XV (fig. 8) is one of the greatest gems of the entire world's palaeolithic art, the most valuable discovery made in Moravia, more valuable even than Venus I called "astonishing" by Sir Arthur Keith in a remarkable article published in the Illustrated London News on October 2, 1937. It is the only portrait of fossil man made by a diluvial artist, because the many portrayals of the diluvial period are ugly carricatures. Only our sculpture is a plastic "photograph" executed true to nature. We know from the innumerable pictures of the Franco-Iberian area that the diluvial artists were able to portray animals with great precision and naturaralistically; but for some, probably superstitious reasons the diluvial artist did not dare to portray the human face true to nature. Therefore we would not know what the Aurignacian mammoth hunter looked like if we did not have this sculpture. So we can understand the enthusiasm of Sir Arthur Keith, when he calls this discovery astonishing. It is a psychological enigma why the artist in Dolni V'stonice in one isolated case deserted the ideology of his tribe, because we also found in Dolni V~stonice two horrible caricatures of portraits, shown in the illustration, of which the second seems to re- present a leper (fig. 9 &amp; Io). One can imagine the scientific and artistic value of our sculpture. Its discovery was not simple. In the log of finds it was entered as "a mammoth ivory torso split in three parts", because 210</page><page sequence="11">,,i iiii!!!!!. . . . . ....... . . . .... . . . ....

Fig. 6 Necklace of mammoth ivory. Venus XlI. ( I : I )</page><page sequence="12">ii Fig. 7 Venus IX sinter-calcite cristals completely filled small fissures in the ivory, holding the grain (fibres) of the ivory apart. I prepared the ob- ject myself, dissolving the cristals in a weak saline solution and I was most pleasantly surprised when the sinter dissolved, the fissures disappeared and the ivory lamina reformed into one mass. There appeared the head of a woman with a high curved fore- head, prominent brows, deepset eyes and a strikingly big, plump nose, corresponding to a theoretical reconstruction of the skulls found in P'redmost. Sir Arthur Keith has made a morphologic- anthropological analysis of the portrait. We now have to analyze the hyperstylized Venus statuette of the Palaeolithic of the Pekirna cave in Moravia. I am doing it on a broad, comparative basis expressed in an illustration with 18 detailed items (fig. Ii), Item 5 shows the Pekairna statuette. In principle it recalls a little our Venus XIV. The upper and lower parts of the body are contracted into cylinders, but this time not the breasts, but the buttocks are represented hypertrophically. In the total shape the representation of the buttocks is a maximum of steatomery. It is interesting that the famous Munich palaeoethnologist Prof. Birkner for many years had a stone plate from his excavations in the Bavarian cave Hohlenstein with three uniform drawings (fig. io, 11, 12), which he could not interpret. Only the discovery of the Pekirna statuette produced an answer, and since that time we talk of the style of the "Buttocks (Posterior) Silhouette". Denis Peyrony discovered similar, still less easily understandable hyperstylizations in the cave La Roche in the Dordogne (fig. I3-I8). F. Peters in 1932 found several of such statuettes in the cave Petersfels in Southern Germany, carved in the shape of perforated pendants (fig. 7, 8). In the Romanian neolithic station Cucuteni we find objects closely resembling our Pekairna statuette (fig. 4, 6). We can see that these posterior figurines are persistent types. It will be quite instructive to give a comparative review of the palaeolithic female statuettes discovered until now; this is an easy task for me, since I have personally inspected all im- portant originals of these figurines from Malta in Siberia to Lespugue in the Pyrenees, and have accurate plaster casts in my possession. There are altogether 91 pieces including 5 reliefs: 212</page><page sequence="13">DI d ........ , --.," \ i ic / b '//', i I qrq %2 A lq Jl 4f Fig. 8 Venus XV Unique portrait of fossil man (slightly enlarged) 213</page><page sequence="14">Siberia : Malta 14 (according to the most recent reports) Ukraine: Kostienki 4 (plus some fragments) Gagarino 7 Mezine (schematized carvings which have not been sufficiently clearly interpreted) Moravia : Predmost 7 Dolni Ve'stonice 15 (including a necklace of 8 sexual-biological carvings) Brno I Pekarna I Austria: Willendorf 2 Rhineland: Mainz 2 Baden: Petersfels 3 (plus many miniature objects) France: Laugerie Basse 2 (Venus I "impudique", Venus II) Laussel 5 (reliefs) Sireuil I Brassempouy 7 Lespugue I Mas d'Azil I Bedeilhac I Mentone 7 Belgium: Trou Margrite I Italy: Savignano sul Panaro I Of course it is impossible to describe all these statuettes here. 1 merely wish to discuss some similarities. The neglect of facial traits is not particularly noteworthy, since the majority of the above figurines has been modelled that way, e. g. the statuettes from Mentone, Savignano, Lespugue, two from Gagarino, two from Willendorf a. o. Unfortunately the head was broken off in many cases - the Venus "impudique", all from Brassempouy, Sireuil and three from Kostienki. The negligant treatment of the arms and their position touching the body is another feature which is frequently repeated, as shown by all the figures from Mentone, two from Gagarino, the Venus impudique a. o. The neglect of the legs is a universal feature. The schematization of the leg stumps is conical with these statuettes-12 from Malta, 6 from Mentone, those of Savignano, Lespugue, Mainz, 3 from Dolni V~stonice a. o. From the point of view of artistic development it is possible to distinguish certain stylistic groups which are not yet sharply separated and which correspond only partly to the geographic distribution of the statuettes: 214</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 9 "The smiling old man" Ceramic carricature Fig. io Another carricature of the human face i. The Vestonice type. Of all statuettes our Venus I is closest to Venus I of Kostienki (Efimenko 1923) and the "long Venus" of Gagarino. They are prototypes of physioplastic, thin, steatomeric women. 2. The Willendorf type. By comparison with the Vestonice type we find physoplastic, fat, steatomeric women--one of Willendorf, the two broad figurines of Gagarino, one of Mentone, "La Poire" of Brassempouy; only these wear the well-hair decoration. The hypertrophic curves might indicate a baroque realism as an explanation of the fantastic conception (E. von Sydov 1932). 3. The Malta type. These carved statuettes from Siberia appear as if made according to a pattern. As far as is known today, they are geographically isolated; they all have faces, noses, eyes, mouths and hair decorations and are partly carved as pendants. With normal or slightly steatomeric bodies, partly ornamented, they undoubtedly form a world of their own and recall in some instances much rather the prehistoric carvings of the Eskimos than palaeolithic sculptures. They are ancient from the ethnomorphological point of view, diluvially-geologically uncertain, for in Northern Siberia, the glacial period still rules today and, according to V. Arseniev, the age difference between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic disappears towards the East. I have stated my opinion concerning the question of the Siberian Palaeolithic critically in 215</page><page sequence="16">avqnano Cucuteni L Eqgype Cucuteni Pekarna Cuculen sul] Panro Marro) 7 8 (9 10 12 Peterels Peerel5s Pekirna Mohlenslein S13115 16 17 18 La Roche Fig. II "Posterior Silhouettes" my third monograph on Dolni VWstonice (1945, pp. 21o/15), q. v.

Finally I prove that the Siberian Malta Venus statuettes cannot possibly be placed on the same contemporal and cultural level as those of the palaeolithic statuettes of the Central and West European Aurignacien, but they form their own level "Siberian". We are facing a virgin territory of 216</page><page sequence="17">rj A'3 f~eFfl\ (*jfI ~ 4K&gt; . 1k, /A -77 (ji J: (Ph.L /1 21 ? lt~~ kI . \ i.i''?j II '411(1.~ /I Fig. -1-</page><page sequence="18">proto-asiatic cultural elements and our Russian colleagues are confronted with tremendous tasks, similar to those of Christy and Lartet, when they first came to the Dordogne. In studying the Siberian Palaeolithic I had the advantage of a personal inspection of the Russian palaeolithic collections in Leningrad, Moscow, Kiew and Dnjepropetrowsk during the :nd International Quaternary Conference; for this occasion the Siberian collections had been brought to Leningrad. 4. The Grimaldi type. This is confined to the Mediterranean statuettes: 3 of Mentone, Savignano and Sireuil (the last one carried off farthest by way of the sea) are steatopygic. s. The Piedmost type. Crude, primitive carvings stressing a round head without face and the abdomen. They give the impression of sitting, pregnant figures. The 161/2 cm long stone Venus III of Kostienki (Efimenko 1931) approaches this type. It is known that there are striking parallels to the Piredmost type in the cultures of Palaeo-Asiatics like Gilyaks, Golds a. o. There they are cut from wood or peat and represent idols supposed to heal different maladies. 6. The Lespugue type. Until now the Lespugue statuette is unique and a special type. It is a mixture between the Vestonice type and a stylized physioplastic figure. No other palaeolithic Venus has such unnatural, stupidly hypertrophic breasts. This statuette is a sculpture stylized into symmetrical, ornamental, spherical and cylindrical motives. There follows a series of stylized ideo-plastics. Until now this collective group consists of heterogeneous elements found sporadically. We do not have enough material. Nevertheless I will now take the opportunity of distinguishing three groups. 7. Stylized "Posterior" Silhouettes, disscussed earlier in this article. 9. The AMezine group of undetermined stylizations, considered to be phalluses by Volkov, and correctly by Breuil to represent females. Such a difference of opinion speaks for itself... A type approaching this group has been found among the V*stonice discoveries. 9. Hyperstylizedindividual types, found up till now only in V~stonice (Venus XIII and XIV, carved necklace XII). io. Portrayals of heads. We must add the three phsioplastic portrayals of heads with facial traits known at present to the statuettes: the small female head of Brassempouy, the Negro face of Mentone and the classical portrait of Vistonice (XV). 218</page><page sequence="19">We therefore have found in the one single station of Dolni Vestonice, in a series of 15 representations of females, both naturalistic and stylized figures ' la Mezine as well as ideoplastic sculptures hyperstylized almost beyond recognition. I am convinced that further excavations in Vestonice will produce figures of the Willendorf type, and on the other hand it will be interesting to see whether hyperstylized objects like those found in Vestonice will be discovered in the new excavations in Willendorf. This observation alone indicates how important it would be to continue excavations in these two sister stations. It is interesting to note that the Eskimo carvings include female figures (idolls), which strongly resemble the Vestonice Venus I in their ideology, the neglect of facial expression, arms and legs, as e. g. one from Naujan (Repulse Bay, Thule culture, original in the Copenhagen Museum). Others are also consistently without facial traits (T. H. Mathiassen 1934, pl. I, fig. 18-21, pl. VII, fig. i-5; Angmassalik Eskimos T. H. Mathiassen 1933, pl. IX, fig. 24; Kangamiut, T. H. Mathiassen 1931, pl. VI, fig. 8-11; Inugsuk, T. H. Mathiassen 1930, pl. XVIII, fig. 12-23; Egedesminde, K. Birket Smith 1924, fig. 24 with hanging breasts; Central Eskimos, T. H. Mathiassen 1927, pl. 57, fig. 15-19, Pl. 78, fig. 16; St. Lawrence Eskimos, H. Collins 1937, pl. 59, fig. 16/17). We find the same ideology in many other prehistoric cultures, e. g. in the ancient pre- dynastic cultures of Egypt of the period 4500 b. C., where only the breasts of the female statuettes are stressed on the cylindrical, hyperstylized bodies. All the rest, including face, arms and legs has disappeared. (Originals in numerous museums, e. g. British Museum, 6th Egyptian Room, case 276). Many statuettes of the Moravian Neolithic (painted ceramics) show a strong steatomery. We could mention many more examples of this prehistoric artistic peculiarity from other periods, but let us rather make an excursion into modern art, the conception of art known as expressionism. Professor W. Paulcke states in his excellent work on palaeolithic and modern art ("Steinzeitkunst und moderne Kunst"): "The exaggeration of special character- istic features in the palaeolithic art (in our case of the breasts, the steatomery), the sharply defined stressing of the notion of what is to be expressed, while neglecting whatever appears secondary to the artist (in our case face, arms, legs), is an artistic principle of the new and especially typical peculiarity of modern expressionism. "New ? Modern ? This expressionism z219</page><page sequence="20">was already present in the art of the glacial mammoth hunters. Let us chose for our compar- ison merely three works of Alexander Archipenko, the Russian artist famous for his "genius of conception", out of the great number of expressionist sculptures: his "Female Figure", "Gondolier" and "Heros". There is a striking resemblance between the execution of the face-less, spherical head of his first-named sculpture and our V6stonice Venus I. In our Venus figurines XIII and XIV we have met palaeolithic expressionist statuettes, which even surpass the "turning inside out of all forms", the "exclusion of all accidental-individualistic features" of Archipenko. Nihil in mundo novi. We see that the theme of diluvial Venus statuttes is to be treated from three points of view: a. Purely palaeo-ethnologically; b. anthropologically; c. art-historically. This last angle, the excursion into expressionism, makes it practically imperative that an art historian trained in the pure morphology of art should participate in a comprehensive study of all known Venus statuettes. May be an American connoisseur of the mysticism of ultra- modern art, who reads this article or hears about it from one of my fellow archaeologists, will have the desire to examine the relation of the diluvial Venus statuttes to the development of a pure naturalistic mutation, idealism and particularly expressionism. Perhaps an organization like the Detroit Institute of Arts would be interested in such a study. I will glady make all of my unique material available. I have endeavored to thow the best of the treasure of the culture of Moravian mammoth hunters. In further articles I will descrive the "Diluvial Pompeji" and the Pekairna Cave with its twelve superimposed cultures. 220</page></plain_text>
