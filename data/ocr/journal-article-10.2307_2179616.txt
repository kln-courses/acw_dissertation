<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number I Whole Volume XLV January, I936 Number 265 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I934-I935* WVITH the death, last August, of Edmond Goblot, honorary professor at the University of Lyons, French philosophy lost one of those who did it most honor. He was seventy-six years of age. His works are less well known than they deserve to be; quite possibly because he never did anything, either outwardly or inwardly, to make their real value known. He strongly dis- liked publicity and any resort to the eulogies of friends or par- tisans; and he had a pronounced aversion for all attempts to make things pleasing to his readers, for anything that might seduce or amuse them. There are, in his works, it is true, formulas that should become classical. But, like the sayings of Lachelier which are often cited even today, they owe nothing to literary elegance or to the elements of surprise; rather they stand out because of the fitness of phraseology and the precision of the thought they embody. "Because there is a struggle for life, there are, of neces- sity, killed and wounded; but how comes it that there are com- batants ?" He was, in philosophy, as much as it is possible to be, a man of science. And this is true, not only because of his positive know- ledge in the fields of mathematics, physics, and biology, solid and extensive as this knowledge was, but also because of his firm resolution never to seek for effects, but always to stick closely to the physical and human realities, and to value nothing so much as the search for truth. The last chapter of his principal work, the Traite de logique, embodies his profession of faith in a broad * Translated by Harold R. Smart.</page><page sequence="2">2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. rationalism, which does not deny what surpasses it, but does insist upon a precise distinction between knowledge and belief. "Science being too restricted for action, it is practically necessary to add an extension on to it; but let us not seek to paint this extension with the colors of science and to conceal the junction, in order to per- suade ourselves that it, too, is the truth." Goblot began to attract attention in i898, by a book modestly entitled Essai sur la classification des sciences, the first part of which consists of an exposition, admirable for that time, of the "logical dualism" common, in spite of appearances to the con- trary, to all forms of knowledge. This dualism is immanent in the movement of thought internal to each science; but there is also a unity of method pervading all the sciences, though manifesting differences of aspect depending upon the varying degrees of ma- turity of these sciences. Every science begins with observation, pro- ceeds to an experimental investigation ("l'exprerience pour voir") and thence to experimental verification, which presupposes a de- ductive process from hypotheses to observable facts. This process becomes more and more systematized, and ends by assuming the aspect of an hypothetico-deductive system. Thus, beginning with a small number of principles, the mind builds an autonomous struc- ture, but a structure which nevertheless acquires a real significance through its numerous points of contact with the object of per- ception and through its ability to predict. In the case of mathe- matics this development took place in ancient Greece. We have seen the same thing happening from the end of the eighteenth cen- tury down to our own times in the case of physics, though not without difficulties and revisions by the way. And chemistry has entered a similar course. "Bio-psycho-sociology" (for Goblot these three sciences are of the same nature and are as closely connected as are physics and chemistry) also displays the same tendency, and will end by assuming the same form, after undergoing more or less lively intellectual adventures. But it must be clearly borne in mind that this formal unity does not imply a gradual absorption of the sciences by each other. Each science will always preserve certain ideas peculiar to it, "positive" in the Baconian sense of the word, which cannot be disregarded without destroying it. Such, for example, is the idea of finality in the biological sciences. To</page><page sequence="3">No. I.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 3 divest this notion of any vestige of mysticism or anthropomorph- ism, to transform it into a scientific concept just as physics has transformed the notion of causality, is one of the tasks to which Goblot devoted much labor. Doubtless, his name will long con- tinue to be associated with this idea.' A summary and clear-cut statement of his principal concep- tions concerning the methods of the sciences and their relations was presented later in the form of lectures at the University of Barcelona and published in I923 under the title, Le Systeme des sciences. Written before the war and only partly printed, it was impossible to publish the Traite de logique before the end of the hostilities. I described this work in some detail in this Review in my survey of French philosophy for the year i9i8, and here it will doubtless suffice to recall the fact that despite an external resemblance to one, the book is profoundly unlike a textbook, and contains a wealth of original ideas and suggestive insights. And it is just as remarka- ble in respect to the feeling of intellectual devotion it manifests, which gives to its conclusions a moral tone rarely found in works of this kind. Moreover, questions of moral philosophy always occupied first place in Goblot's thoughts. The interest he manifested in political, economic and moral problems is well displayed in Justice et li- berte (i902) and in La barriere et le niveau, (written about i900 but not published until I925). His Logique des jugements de valeur (I927) is perhaps more interesting on account of the practical applications it contains than for the properly logical ideas which serve as their framework. Logical and social studies were always interconnected in his mind by the closest bonds. At the beginning of his career as professor of philosophy at Angers, then at the Universities of Caen and Toulouse, he devoted himself to socio- logical studies. And it was with a view to laboring more usefully in this field that he was prompted to ask himself these questions concerning the method and classification of the sciences which were the objects of his main thesis for his degree and which finally led him to the logical works published in his maturity. 1"La finalite sans intelligence", Revue de Metaphysique, igoo.

II One of the most striking characteristics of French philosophy, this year, is the number and importance of works inspired by spiritual or even frankly religious interests. True, this spiritualism is no longer the same as that of Maine de Biran, of Cousin or of Ravaisson. It seems to me, however, that it retains the same essen- tial tendencies. "Les responsabilites de la pensee et le possibilite de son achevement", by Maurice Blondel, forms the second volume of his great work on La Pensee.2 (The first volume was discussed in these pages a year ago.) His aim is, on the one hand, to display in bold relief the successes of intelligence-successes which render a complete scepticism impossible-and, on the other hand, to demonstrate its incurable insufficiency. This forever unfinished character of the work of the intelligence should warn us not to rest in its current formulations, but to seek how, and on what con- ditions, it might attain to that complete and coherent intelligibility towards which it forever strives. At the same time Blondel en- deavors to emphasize all the errors and deviations threatening, ac- cording to him, human thought, and tending to cause it to miss the narrow passage whereby it may attain to a full realization of its nature and a final satisfaction of its demands. One such error is to linger over the logical and partially intelligible aspect of things, and over the work of scientific construction, incontestable but essentially fragmentary as such work is. Doctrines limiting them- selves thus, under pretext of their objective reality, "constitute a mutilated thought, and come dangerously near to infidelity to the law of our spiritual development". But there is no less a deficiency in that sort of irrationalism which refuses to contemplate anything save the lacunae and equally partial failures of science. Following this line leads to "a sort of intuitionism or immanentism bestowing credit upon the infinite for the inventions of thought, and seeing in this unlimited plasticity the only pure act, the only condition of the life of the spirit, the only truth remaining amongst the ruins of positive laws, philosophical systems, social organizations and spiritual dogmatisms. This renunciation of the old intellectualism engenders now a blind fideisme, now a revolutionary pragmatism which ends by excluding intelligence to the profit of violence; X Paris, Alcan (Bibliotheque de philosophie contemporaine).</page><page sequence="5">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 5 more often still it leads to a neo-romanticism which worships in- stinct and which has justifiably been compared to a new invasion by the Barbarians." Shall one seek to reunite the two edges of this intellectual rent, to balance against each other intuition and discursive reason? Blondel sees in this effort at synthesis another, and even in his opinion, the most "toxic" of all errors. For it is an effort which seems best to satisfy thought, without transcending its present, ready-made forms, and one tending most easily to calm the dis- turbance, and in this wise preventing us from transporting our- selves to a transcendental world. Hence he goes so far as to say that this is "the crime par excellence"; it dispenses with the divine by substituting the human for it. But, he adds, this arrogant pre- tense is illusory; if one is sincere and attentive, he will always rediscover the rent (or fault, fissure or cleft). Blondel has an inexhaustible supply of images of this sort, all designed to bring out the contradictory duality and the essential incompleteness of our acts of thought. We imagine we are reconciling logic and in- tuition; whereas in reality they are as impossible to unite as are oil and water. Of such factors we can only make an emulsion whose continuity is merely apparent. Upon looking closer it is seen that we leap ceaslessly, in dealing with details, from one position to its contrary; we fall back, turn and turn about, from one doctrine to the other, the instant it is felt that one of the two is untenable. Thought destroys itself by an alternation of contradictory atti- tudes. On the contrary, so thinks Blondel, it is by taking conscious account both of its incompleteness and of what it has already pro- duced of solid worth, that our intelligence may succeed in passing through the narrow gate and in discovering within itself a more profound truth which in turn will permit it to comprehend its own proper nature. "If there be a deficiency in us, it is less a matter of an absence than of a presence." Est Deus in nobis . . . The entire book is so rich in content that at times there is an impression of slowness in its progress. Rarely has anyone taken more care in noting various shades of meaning and in making necessary reservations, in forearming himself against hasty sim- plifications, or the superimposing of new dialectical stages upon</page><page sequence="6">6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. the theses and antitheses which originally present themselves. As in the first volume, numerous and long appendices are added to complete the work, reply to objections, foresee possible misunder- standings and confusions and to render more precise the distinc- tion between "the two thoughts in each one of our thoughts", which shift back and forth between each other. Thus we have (i) conceptual knowledge, which can nourish itself only with the thought of a reality superior to the empirical order; and (2) know- ledge of a pure intelligibility, which can grasp itself only by means of the play of concepts. "To distinguish without separa- ting, to unite without confusing"-such is the title of one of these complementary notes, and such is also the constant endeavor of the author. This endeavor, moreover, is closely related to the theory of insufficiency which does not allow us to stop at any point, under pain of losing what we think we possess already. In- cidentally, in these "excursuses" Blondel also excuses, one might almost say that he justifies, as artist quite as much as sage phi- losopher, certain capricious and paradoxical characteristics of modern art. He combats the violently irrationalistic mysticism of Karl Barth, and the Claudelian myth of Animus and Anima. But all this constitutes only "chips from the workshop"; the work carried on there is the construction of the stages leading to the supreme throne. We are to see its completion in another work, whose editing is already far advanced, and which, after L'Action and La Pensee, will bring us into the presence of L'Atre. There is no mistake, I think, in sensing a Blondelian influence -doubtless slightly tinged with Bergson's-in a charming little dialogue conducted by Jacques Paliard, Le Monde des idoles.3 It makes one think of what Renan once related concerning the conversations the various convolutions of his brain carried on with one another. But while Renan restrained himself from draw- ing any conclusions, the interlocutors of the Monde des idcoles gradually elevate themselves to a superior point of view, to which their discourse causes us also to make the ascent. Two students- of an ancient school, to judge by the scenery, of a very modem school, to judge by what they think about-Simmias and Crito, 'Paris, Alcan.</page><page sequence="7">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 7 first discuss the nature of truth. The former is gay, pragmatical, empirical and even sceptical; the latter, more dogmatic, spiri- tualistic, but also more sensitive and sadder, sees profoundly that sensation, need, habit have meaning only in virtue of something surpassing them. A second dialogue raises the question of finality and resolves it in terms of the unity of the real, which our ana- lytical thinking breaks up. Our idea of finality is only an artifice, but a legitimate one, for it serves to compensate the artifice whereby we have divided what is really a whole. The third dia- logue brings to the fore a third personage, Philonous, who had previously remained in the background. He seems to be at once a friend and a master-. He it is who shows that in the theory of knowledge one must not be the dupe either of the metaphor of impression or of that of fabrication, for both refer to a higher term; in every act, in every thought, we really function as a mecha- nism, but not less really as spirituality. Confronted with the diffi- culty, as great in theory as in practice, of knowing others, he teaches the solidarity of the thee and the I, and that their whole reality resides in their relationship. But this relationship may sig- nify egoism and conquest; or it may signify love and devotion. I would like to cite here (but unfortunately that would take too much space) the subtle, elegantly written passages, wherein this relationship of souls is described, and the actions and reactions they exercise upon each other by means of the reciprocal idea that each one composes of the other. The dialogue ends with the question already inevitably raised by Blondel's two volumes, namely, what reality is to be ascribed to evil? What knowledge has God of evil, and how can He endure it? Paliard does not at- tempt to resolve this difficulty, but neither does he seek to mini- mize it. He recognizes "the failure of logical clarity" as to this point. But he has no doubts that it resolves itself in God, or that the "Abyss of Good consumes the evil in its own love". This is a question to which we shall be brought back later on. III Although its author neither allies himself with any set of dogmas nor claims allegiance to any church, the same spiritualistic and religious character attaches to the new volume by Le Senne,</page><page sequence="8">8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. Obstacle et valeur.' This book displays remarkable philosophical vigor and a rare talent in the writing. It would be difficult indeed to exercise a choice from the many passages worthy of inclusion in an anthology. He, also, raises himself from a total experience, "anterior to all the judgments of reality which may be deposed there", to God, the last term of the ascending dialectical process, and the principle of all values, or rather identical with value in so far as concerns the existence of a real being and not an a posteriori abstraction. One chapter of the work is also given to the same no- tion of "fissure" (or rent) which plays such a large r6le in the Blondelian dialectic. The word, moreover, was borrowed by Blon- del from a communication made by Le Senne three years ago to the Societe de philosophie, as is recalled by the author of La Pensee himself.5 But the term is not understood in precisely the same fashion by the two philosophers. For Blondel it is primarily a matter of a lacuna in intelligibility; for Le Senne it is a check to action, provoked by an obstacle. "At the heart of experience, where indivisibility still dominates discontinuity, a disturbance an- nounces the 'emergence' of a determination which, due to the encounter of an assemblage of material forces and a convergence of reflections, is going to be (and to be thought) a cause of arrest." The movement of thought, for Le Senne, and the style in which he writes, are also very different from those which made a page from Blondel's works so easily recognizable. These differences are difficult to define, for the first thing that must be said is that in both respects these works are singularly original, singularly ex- pressive of a personality and a temperament; and this type of originality is precisely of the sort that does not lend itself to analysis. It can only be conveyed by examples. That is why I place here a profound and striking passage concerning the rela- tions of God and the ego. "Any philosophy is a compromise be- tween the existential unity of God and the philosopher. Such a philosophy is true in so far as it participates in spirit; it is mere ornamentation in so far as it manifests that which all determina- tion and all limited existence admits of inadequacy. It is with philosophy just as it is with all work and all action. They deserve 'Paris, Aubier. Collection "Philosophie de lEsprit". Les Responsabilite's i8. Cf.

Dualism is true of the existential origins of being; monism is true in the sense of resulting from the convergence of their initiatives, wherein it succeeds in producing itself." Le Senne excels in making abstractions come alive, sometimes by connecting them through a brief allusion with the typically concrete they represent, but more often by preserving their char- acter as abstractions, and nevertheless giving them all the clear- cut features of reality by means of analogical transpositions, and by the feelings he evokes on their account. Here again it is best to give examples. Desiring to express the movement of the mind which transforms everything into objects placed on the same foot- ing, while forgetting the subject which makes the objects and the values which communicate an interest to them, he invents, to repre- sent it, this apt formula: "levelling dialectic" (dialectique d'apla- tissement). Desiring to contrast the thorny step-by-step progress through things and the view from above which dominates them, he discovers, to make this opposition vivid, the luminous expres- sion, "wading through" (enlisement) and "flight above" (survol). To point out all of these expressive verbal inventions would be at the same time to trace out the fundamental directions of this dia- lectic and the stages of its development. Its point of departure is in an idea of experience, in the broadest sense of the word, op- posed both to empiricism and intuitionism, which can be expressed only by a "description of consciousness" wherein relations are to be found as well as the "determinations" they presuppose, and to which they oppose themselves. The role of philosophy is to orga- nize this reality without impoverishing it, by distinguishing within it contrasts, structures and movements. It has often been said of Hegel that, in order really to understand him, one must begin one's reading at the end, place oneself at the start in the most com- plete totality. That is the point of view adopted here. This unity of experience (sharply distinguished from the Kantian transcen- dental subject, which is limited to the intellectual and a priori) is what Le Senne denominates the I. The ego, on the contrary, is</page><page sequence="10">10 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. that which, within experience, opposes itself to the non-ego or to other egos. The I is universal; it is center and surface; it sub- tends whatever can be lived through or thought. Here again one ought to cite the beautiful passages, inspired by this idea, on the real nature of personality and on the moral life. Reflection forms itself at the heart of spontaneity; the obstacle causes the birth of emotion and astonishment, which in turn stimulate the endeavor to surmount it; in this effort distinctions (never exclusive of con- nections) constitute themselves between the "determinations" of fact and values, between the appeal which exercises itself on the same level, by degrees, amongst homogeneous terms, and the in- fluence which exercises itself transversally and in an all-encom- passing manner. All this is only a series of antitheses, scantily sketched out here in words. Perhaps, however, it may suggest what Le Senne's work conveys with so much force and in such a variegated manner, namely that everything bathes itself in spirit, not as do things in an inert space, but as everything said or done in Europe from I914 to i9i8 bathed itself in the war atmosphere, or in the sense in which the attitude of each personage in the Apotheosis of Homer is to be explained only by the composition as a whole. "Never has the temptation to reduce experience to 'determinations' impressed itself more imperiously on consciousness than today. . . . The nineteenth century has bequeathed to the twentieth an idolatry of science and of society which will end by engulfing the ego in civilization, if the very disarray into which civilization casts it, by the multiplication of foreign or social wars, does not intervene to restore it to itself. And this disarray must not be a source of im- pulsiveness. It is the task of a critical philosophy first of all to dissolve these supposed entities between which there is danger of crushing the individual, and secondly it is the task of moral and religious philosophy to show that the good and the goodness of man are not the necessary products of a deterministic order, but that on the contrary they presuppose within man himself a con- scious feeling of his responsibility and a love of absolute and infinite value." This passage occurs in the middle of the book; but it might well serve as its conclusion. For one must feel intensely what the</page><page sequence="11">No. I.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE II author himself, in speaking of what it is that opposes itself to the multiplicity of things, calls-the "atmosphere". In the same collection-"Philosophie de l'Esprit"-and as it were- representing another aspect of this same orientation of thought, which occupies today so much space in the minds of the younger generation of French philosophers, a new, extremely lively work by Gabriel Marcel has just appeared. This work is connected in a twofold way with the same writer's Journal meta- physique, written at the time of the war and published in 1927. For one thing the title itself, ?tre et avoir,6 marks the reappear- ance of an opposition enunciated in one of the last pages of the Journal, and more fully elaborated in the chapter entitled "Esquisse d'une phinomenologie de l'avoir". As for the second connection, the first two thirds of the volume are a continuation of the same Journal, abandoned in I923, resumed in i928, and just now pub- lished, including the author's reflections for October I933. Like Blondel, Gabriel Marcel is not only concerned with the spiritual; he is also an avowed Catholic-not however in the same way. Blondel is a Catholic by tradition and by birth. Gabriel Marcel, after long years of study and philosophical uneasiness, informs us himself, in his book, of the dates of his conversion and baptism. "Miraculous happiness this morning", he writes on the fifth of March, i929, "I have for the first time enjoyed the experience of divine grace"; and the following pages are filled with the moving description of the new lights which shine for him, and with reflections full of faith in the credibility of the evangelical texts. This is not to say that hereupon his work must be classed with the literature of edi- fication; in fact no work resembles such literature less. Even the essays representing especially an apologetic orientation, such as "Remarques sur l'irrieligion contemporaine", and "R~eflexions sur la foi",7 bear throughout the marks of excellent philosophical studies, and remain on a high level of reflection-except, perhaps, in the latter essay, certain arguments which are as unfair as they are hackneyed. Such for example is the fixing of the onus probandi on those who "do not wish to believe" in the dogmas, and the Paris, Aubier. Collection "Philosophie de l'Esprit". Lectures delivered before the Fideration des Rtudiants chritiens.</page><page sequence="12">I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. accusing them of a "pride" very foreign indeed to many among them. Nevertheless many pages of this Journal as well as of the lectures are of great philosophical importance, and very suggestive even for those who do not share the beliefs of the author. Many examples could be cited, such as the ingenious justification of realism by means of criticisms of the thesis which makes the idea an object of thought, and of the point of view which allows of the elimination of the idea of Being; the subtle and impassioned analysis of the relations between this idea and the principle of identity; the opposition between the spectacular life, which is a desertion, and the detachment of the saint (one may also say, of the wise man), which is a renunciation. "Just there", he says, "is the metaphysical justification of asceticism." We may note also the profound and elaborated comparison of the I and the thou. The author advances the idea, profoundly con- trary to common opinion, but expressed also by Blondel, and remi- niscent of Malebranche, according to which, in consciousness of self, "the shadow is in the center". And finally to be noted is the intense awareness of that philosophical conversion, that philo- sophical turning about, first signalized by Bergson, which consists in abandoning the ordinary direction of thought, the relations of things to each other on the same plane, to precipitate itself towards the source which projects these mobile images. In the moral realm one will be struck by the consideration of the ideas of engagement, promise and fidelity. "Man is the sole being who makes promises", so it has been said; and yet are promises to be approved, when one cannot know in what inward situation one will find oneself to- morrow?8 Let us note also the analyses of charity, and of its con- nection with "disposability"-as Andre Gide loves to say; of hope, as opposed to probability; of self-sacrifice and its possibility; and also, from the same point of view, of being and having (which gives the title to the work), and which joins up with the preceding. 'In Volume IV of the Recherches philosophiques (I934-I935) the same author has published "Remarques sur les notions d'acte et de personne" whose point of departure is these ideas of engagement and promise in their relation to action and personality.-A very interesting article, but one in which the word "individual" is used in a very special and somewhat arbitrary way. We announced last year the death of the principal founder of these Recherches, Professor A. Spaier; they are now being published under the editorial direction of a new committee consisting of Messrs. Bachelard, Koyre, H. Ch. Puech, Michel Souriau and Jean Wahl.</page><page sequence="13">No. I.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE I3 For to the extent to which we possess we are indisposable, as when a man has invested his capital.-However, that only partly applies to the idea of having a body, which Gabriel Marcel presents as the purest type of possession. For the body is the instrument par excellence whose perfection consists in its disposability. Does not the author himself write: "To have, is to dispose of . . ."? It is very true, on the other hand, that often "our possessions con- sume us", and that we are tyrannized over by our bodies. But in such case, as the proverb has it, "we possess ourselves no longer". Along with these essentially philosophical thoughts one must also mention the reflections concerning the problem of evil and moral error, and especially those, extremely vital, having to do with the idea of God." This idea has for long been an integral part of philosophy. But it has become almost foreign to philosophy during the last half century, and has been reserved for the domain of immediate intuitive faith. I have noted in previous articles that men like Le Senne, Lavelle, and Julien Benda are today working in France to restore its philosophical significance, from different points of view. But is there place, between science and belief, for a legitimate and intermediate domain? Consideration of this ques- tion would bring us back to the phrase of Goblots cited at the beginning of this article. If only by reaction, Gabriel Marcel's book is a powerful incitement to thought. We are not departing from the same intellectual 'climate' in making a few remarks on a little book by Lavelle, short in length but rich in content, which summarizes certain lectures presented by the author to the Association Fenelon, and entitled Liberte' et personne.10 It will be recalled that Lavelle, with his colleague, Le Senne,11 edits the collection "Philosophie de l'Esprit", in which he himself previously published La Presence totale. But while Le Senne's book is noteworthy for the abundance and richness of its content, the brochure by Lavelle succeeds admirably at condensa- tion and brevity. It is indeed a vigorous Epictetian Manual of this type of philosophy, which aims to throw into relief the existence #"An atmosphere which would be at the same time a presence", says Marcel to characterize our sense of the divine.

XLV. of realities not less positive, according to the author, than the spatial or the mobile, but belonging to another plane. Freedom is not the absurd indeterminism of movements which by their very nature cannot be thought, save in terms of the category of determi- nation. It is not even a quality or property; nor is it a part of our possessions, or even of what we are. "It is something that can never be given, is never such and such; something which far from making part of our nature, rather enables us to utilize that nature, to discover it, to surpass it" and "to take control of our individual selves"; something which is not an element in nature and found in us like a temperament already made when we acquire con- sciousness of ourselves. It is neither a power nor an object but the condition of powers and objects. The discovery of it which we make by reflection is full of peril; it arouses a sort of drunken- ness, leads us at first to oppose others and to esteem in ourselves only what is different and unique, to revolt against all constraint and to treat ourselves as if we were Gods. More profound reflec- tion raises it above the arbitrary; "it is the light of our delive- rance". We come to understand that this surplus of being in us de- stroys itself if subordinated to the "determinations", as Le Senne would say, found already made in this strange object which is its own self. The ends of liberty are transcendent, as it itself is. The proper function of the individual is to take control of the world as it is, in order to introduce into it the character of value common to different minds (esprits), through which it acquires a more perfect intelligibility and a spiritual significance. Thus choice, at first sight seemingly the essential characteristic of liberty, is only a preliminary stage to it; the saint has chosen once and for all. But if there is no longer hesitation, that is not to say that there is no more effort, and that one may come to rest in a quietism, of which nature and individual egoism would soon make an end. "Freedom obliges us to engage ourselves wholly, every single moment, and to assume responsibility for what we- are in an un- interrupted creation of our very being." IV "When raising the problem of Evil", writes Gabriel Marcel in the work discussed above, "I treat it as an accident which has hap- pened to a certain machine, namely, the Universe, in which I</page><page sequence="15">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 15 imagine myself to be situated. In that way I consider myself not only as freed from this malady or infirmity [why?], but as ex- terior to the Universe, which I pretend to reconstitute, at least ideally, in its integrity. But what access can I then have to ontology as such ?" This is truly to rid oneself of a difficulty very economi- cally. And moreover, as' far as concerns Blondel or even Lavelle, I have already observed in preceding articles how little troubled they are by Leibniz's great problem. Wilfred Monod, on the con- trary, has pondered over this problem his entire lifetime. From his prolonged meditations there has resulted a huge and stirring work, very interesting reading for all that it contains more than 2,800 pages, entitled Le probleme du bien, essai de thkeodicee et journal d'un pasteur.12 From day to day he has assembled his own reflections on the problem: Si Deus est, unde malum? The content of the book is drawn from letters on this subject received by the author together with his replies, the various events and facts which have occurred to him, and his prodigiously extensive reading and the discussions thereto attached. We traverse all the routes he has followed himself-a conversation with a taxi-driver as well as a critique of Renouvier's metaphysical ideas. In large part the work is admirably written, without rhetoric, but con- taining many happy verbal inventions and striking images which spring effortlessly from a profundity and intensity of feeling. The reader realizes that he is in the presence of a spiritual life with all of its activity and freshness, of a contagious and intrepid ardor, which shuns no difficulty, but on the contrary brings out into the clear light of day all that is absurd, cruel, repugnant and mon- strous in nature. The picture he draws of animal biology, in par- ticular, surpasses in power of creating hallucinations all that has been said since Lucretius on the dysteleology of living creatures, on the injustices and ferocities of this life which certain believers tax their ingenuity to divine.

Of everything the sceptics and atheists have had to say about the contradiction involved in the idea of a God at once both perfectly good and all powerful, Wilfred Monod con- ceals nothing; indeed he himself adopts and even strengthens every one of their arguments. The first part of his work is wholly given over to this pessimistic survey. But the remedy lies ready to hand in the arguments themselves. For we have to do, not with a bene- ficent God, a Father responsible for our world, but rather with an amoral or antimoral demiurge, a sort of elan vital not directed towards the Good. To him must be referred what the Gospels say of the "Prince of this World", of "the Adversary", against whom Jesus engaged in a struggle in the name of "His Father". Like J. S. Mill, Renouvier, W. James, and H. G. Wells, the author un- equivocally renounces the dogma of divine omnipotence, and around this renunciation he constructs a new metaphysics. Essen- tially religious in aim and inspiration, this monumental work is nevertheless full of philosophy. A good book could be made were one to extract all that concerns questions habitually discussed by philosophers, without regard to any preconceived beliefs-ques- tions such as that of the solidarity of theoretical and practical rea- son; of the refutation of those who imagine they see in biology the emergence of a more from a less; of the protest, such as Auguste Comte's, against the reduction of the -sciences and of the types of being, the one to the other; of the study of the gaps, the limits and obstacles of the evolutionary process; of a theory of teleology which recalls the theses of an "anti-clerical" like Goblot or those of Blondel and Le Senne referred to above. These ex- amples could easily be multiplied. In what does this "Kingdom of Darkness", which limits the power of the good principle, consist? We cannot explain it (this makes me think of a famous remark of Lachelier's); and, on this point, Monod the Christian is an agnostic. This adverse force is recognized to be the real obstacle opposing the spirit of Christ and his disciples. It is not the place here to analyse his exegesis of the Gospels, his ideas concerning the role of Jesus exorcist of demons, enemy of evil, coming to the aid of humanity, whose action perhaps is limited, even to our Earth. But in venturing to</page><page sequence="17">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 17 make these changes in what the dogma, Catholic or Protestant, ordinarily teaches, he centers his thought especially on human life, on the traces of good he finds in it. In this respect he is very close to Blondel, who amongst all the 'fissures' preventing the fruition of thought, nevertheless finds bits of knowledge secure enough to refute pure scepticism. Full recognition of the evil, real and radical though it be, said Monod in a conversation about his book, is "the black screen on which appears the phosphoresence of a reassuring and positive enigma: the problem of Good".13 "The world", he says again, "does not reflect the image of the Father, but exudes a mystery of liberty and finality". In this way he establishes a connection with that philosophy of value which today predomi- nates over the philosophy of existence, and which is scarcely con- tested, save verbally, by those who speak, in place of God, of Nature or of Life. For they wish to emphasize that at bottom, in spite of everything that is hateful in Nature or Life, as man finds it, there is nevertheless at work a revolutionary power hav- ing something of good in it, and which is esteemed superior to what has for recommendation only that it exists.'4 The "fourth idea" that Monod equates with the ideas of God, the soul and immortality, is that faith in God, when it is sincere, corresponds to an internal attitude as real and efficacious as no matter what form of matter or energy. He discusses several times, from this point of view, the picture of creative evolution as traced by Berg- son. And he refuses to ascribe, with Bergson, a common root to instinct and intelligence, to nature and spirit. Would not the struggle we so tragically sense within ourselves be on this hypothe- sis as illusory as a theatrical illusion? "Is it not rather a matter of a profound current of spirituality projected, like the Gulf Stream, across waters chilled at the Pole and supporting an energy of a contrary nature?" Do we not have here, as he himself says a little later-and far be it from me to protest against the expres- sion-a "redemptive involution"? We may associate with these abstract theistic metaphysical works an abundantly documented study by Etcheverry of L'idea- Bulletin of the Union pour la ve' rite, June I935. 14 "Nature is the kingdom of judgments of existence; history the kingdom of judgments of value".

For, says he, no philosophy has ever been able to dispense with realism, in spite of the most expressly announced intentions. In a certain sense, perhaps the most extensively recognized one, the observation appears to be correct. Quite recently, also, a defense of realism has been under- taken by Ruyer, with skill and spirit, in the new volume of Recherches philosophiques'6 already mentioned. But these desig- nations of systems, and especially the word 'idealism', acquire such divergent connotations that one rarely knows what they represent. Etcheverry disapproves of my having thence concluded, in the Vocabulaire of the Socicete franpaise de philosophie, that one must use them as sparingly as possible. He himself recognizes, however, how equivocal they are. And indeed his conclusion sup- plies a good illustration of this, for he bases himself on Lachelier's celebrated dictum that "The world is a thought which does not think itself, suspended from a thought which does think itself"- which Brunschvisg would take to be the purest profession of idealistic faith.17 If there be anything common to all these meanings of 'idealism' it is a very respectable desire to reject naive materialism, to check- mate the coarseness of thought of the vulgar who lacks the ability to criticize or reflect upon himself. There is also, but less generally, a certain care for spiritual dignity, for moral elevation. There may also be many other things. A very amusing Italian booklet, whose objective is easily guessed, presents a young man who wishes to enter politics and who is looking for a good philo- sophical manner. Shall he call himself a positivist, a realist or a spiritualist? No; for all of these epithets may stir up unfortunate associations of ideas. But idealist-that sounds fine! But to my mind its doctrine is not the most interesting feature of this book, but rather the richness and conscientiousness of its documentation.

Not only are the chapters well arranged, but several indexes facilitate the use of this museum of opinions and arguments. It is capable of rendering the greatest service to those outside of France who wish to become au courant of contemporary French philosophical discussions. V Although this metaphysical current has produced this year, as we have seen, numerous- and noteworthy works, philosophy in the more technical sense of the word, more analogous to special studies in the sciences, also has produced several important pub- lications. To the great Traite de psychologie normale et pathologique,'8 in course of publication under the editorship of Georges Dumas, has been added a fourth volume. Dumas himself analyses the process of symbolism; Delacroix, the association of ideas; Pieron, attention, habit and memory; Revault d'Allones, schematization (including the larger part of what is usually called understanding, logic and reason); Ch. Blondel, automatic activity and mental synthesis; Pierre Janet, psychological tension; Poyer, intellectual labor and fatigue; Claparede, sleep and dreams. In La notion de fait psychologique,'9 Blanche studies rather the philosophy of psychology than psychology itself. This book, one of his theses for the doctorate, is a serious, searching, well-thought-out study, written in a precise and clear language, and well-informed on the questions with which it deals. Lubac has devoted a volume to what he calls- Le Cycle de l'inconscient,20 and Malgaud has pub- lished De l'Action a la pense, 21 a sort of Siris wherein we are led by degrees from a series of psychological observations, often minute and novel, to the "metaphysical problem of knowledge", whose solution is indicated by the title.

Entering the domain of sociology, we are still in large part in that of psychology, so far as concerns the new book by Levy- Bruhl, La Mythologie primitive.25 This is a new addition to the universally admired-and utilized26-series of learned works on the mentality of non-civilized peoples. The book is not indeed con- cerned with the history of religions or sociology in the strict sense of the word, but, as the author himself points out, with their rela- tions to the characters and orientation of mental functions in men of inferior societies. The facts analysed and interpreted in this book concern mainly but not exclusively the primitive Australians and the Papuans of New Guinea. The method followed in this work is particularly prudent. Just as the author took care in his previous works not to attribute to primitive societies anything that civilized peoples mean by the terms 'cause', 'soul', and 'supernatural', so he now protects himself against taking for granted, at the beginning of his investigations, a community of. nature between the myths of primitive peoples and those which have been rendered familiar to us by classical Antiquity. "We shall proceed with respect to them", he declares, "as if we were confronted with data not yet classified or analysed, and shall inspect them, if it may be, 'with new eyes'. We shall consider them in their natural setting and solely from the point of view of their setting." 22 Paris, Alcan. 'Paris, Alcan.

They are secret; considered as connected with the very existence of the tribe. They are a means of participation in the mana, the dema, this transcendental force with its unusual mani- festations, which (through concrete objects as its instruments- or rather as centers of condensation) exercises a most considera- ble action on individual and social life, and is at the same time the origin or proximate cause of all visible and tangible things. Thus there are in these legends real animals, which are only what they appear to be, and make-believe animals, that is to say, human beings momentarily assuming the animal form, or the creations of a sorcerer, or beings of a double nature which can at will mani- fest themselves under the one or the other of their aspects. For the savage, the external form is only an accident. It reveals, in a changing and fluid fashion, a sort of powerful and badly defined energy in which we are immersed. Here again one must speak of an "atmosphere" exercising an influence irreducible to a well- defined play of physical causes. The methodical care taken by LUvy-Bruhl to introduce nothing of our own into the study of our lesser brothers renders the conclusions drawn from this study extremely striking. That is to say, it turns out that the resemblances prevail over the differ- ences, and that the sort of mentality which displays itself roughly in the Aruntas and the Marind-Anims is far from being absent among the most 'enlightened' peoples; in the latter case it is merely concealed by social intellectual discipline, or as one may say, by educational conventions. The folk-lore of our societies, so far as concerns animal stories, reveals itself to be "very closely related to that of the primitives". Witness the tales of Little Red Riding- hood, of Puss in Boots and other popular stories dating from ancient times but maintaining themselves indefinitely. The per- sistent existence of these fairy-tales is particularly remarkable in that it shows elements common to epochs and civilizations which are yet very different in many other respects. One could not explain otherwise the charm they possess for both old and young in the most cultivated societies. We have to do with a way of thinking as natural to the human race as is running or jumping. "What would require explanation is, not that so many more or</page><page sequence="22">22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLV. less primitive societies believe, quite simply, in the truth of the greater number of these tales; but on the contrary, why, in our society, we have for so long ceased to believe in them." The development of reflection and experience, bound up with the technical utilization of nature, took place, in the Occident, in the Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilizations. The recipes which proved to be absolutely reliable, for no matter what human being, have permitted the "constitution" of reason.27 But human history as well as human geography reveals the instability of this acquisi- tion. Maintenance of reason requires a strict discipline, and that is why we experience a sort of relief in quitting reason for dreams, a treatise on physics for the Tales of Perrault. Just as LUvy-Bruhl describes the opposition between myth and science, so Raoul Allier describes that between Magie et Religion.28 His preceding studies on Psychologie de la conversion chez les non-civilises, and on Le non-civilise et nous, have led him to the conviction that magic-ceremonial magic, of course, in abstraction from "natural magic", which prolongs itself in science-is a de- generation of religion. By religion he understands the sense of the presence of one or several spiritual beings, wiser and stronger than we, with whom we can enter into relations up to a certain point, by prayer. He thus opposes those who derive religion from magic and those who see in these two attitudes a differentiation of a primitive, amorphous state of affairs, assumed to exist with- out historical warrant, in virtue of the prejudice that the heterogeneous always emerges by evolution from the homogeneous, the 'integrated' from the uncoordinated, and the superior from the inferior. These views are illustrated by the analysis of a large number of facts, some borrowed from the 'primitives', others taken from the history of the various religions. Although Raoul Allier is Honorary Dean of the Faculty of Protestant Theology, he does not claim any special privilege for the Judeo-christian religion in par- ticular. He is very far from subscribing to the old theories a' la Jo- seph de Maistre, long accepted by the missionaries, who believed that all barbaric or savage religions were but the distorted echo 7 See Revue des Cours et Conferences, i5 and 30 April, I925. ' Paris, Berger-Levrault.</page><page sequence="23">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 23 of the revelation made to Adam and the patriarchs. The superiority he accords-in a slightly doubtful voice-to Christianity is that it is one of those religions for which there is most hope that it will not "drown itself out", or be stifled by its automatic performance. But his main thesis is that religion, as he understands it, is a constant and universal function of the human spirit, which sloth and egoism tend to stifle under a burden of routine, egoism, and auto-suggestions springing from animal life. The creation of a mechanical ritualism, of duties or sacraments performed in the manner of a chemical reaction, the influence exercised by pro- fessionals-priests, medicine-men, sorcerers-displaces religion towards what he calls magic and magic towards malfeasance. It is clear that his conception is not unrelated to the ideas expounded by Bergson in Les deux sources, or to those of Le Senne, Lavelle and W. Monod, mentioned above. And thus we are brought back, by studies of a sociological nature, into the metaphysical atmos- phere in which we were earlier immersed. We enter quite another 'climate' with the brief and excellent work by Bougle, entitled Bilan de la sociologie franfaise contem- poraine.29 He accomplishes the feat of presenting, in 170 pages of small format, a luminous picture, exact and complete, of the so- ciological work performed in France in the last twenty years, especially by the group of seekers whose common organ is the AnnS e sociologique, and who continue the work of Durkheim (in turn the successor of Auguste Comte), with a freedom of spirit of which the author gives one of the best examples. The greatest respect for the memory of the master we lost in I9I7 does not prevent most of his successors from maintaining complete inde- pendence with respect to his doctrines on such and such particular points. And it is very legitimate that it should be so in a school whose most fundamental rule is to study social facts as the astrono- mer studies the stars or the biologist organisms. Are not the real heirs of Newton or of Pasteur those who, faithful to their idea of science, have freely revised many of their theories?

XLV. part in it, in contact with all the outstanding men of his generation and the following, Bougle was better situated than anyone else to trace out its essential directions. Le Bilan de la sociologie franfaise presents in the clearest manner the men, the works, the tendencies and the discussions which bestow so much life and attractiveness on this field of studies. It enables one to acquire in a few hours a knowledge of these things as reliable and detailed as one could wish. What appears with the greatest force from these studies is the extent to which sociological ideas have exerted their influence in all other fields, and even on men who in principle strive to react against them, and to take notice of the legitimate place of other points of view. Thus many chapters of psychology, ethno- graphy, history and law have been revised. The science of eco- nomics, to the history of which Bougle has devoted his teaching for more than twenty-five years (and it is very necessary to say this, for Bougle too modestly effaces himself in what he has written on this subject), also owes to sociology rectifications and develop- ments of great import. But in the concluding chapters he speaks in his own person and in the name of his sociological associates, in order to reply to certain attacks of which they have been the object. He grants that no science can create a will, and that as a consequence sociology is unable, by means of simple assertions, to prove to the egotistical individual or to a conquering State that it is wrong to want to make themselves centers and leaders of action, and that peace, agreement and fraternity are worth more than the struggle for life and the triumph of the stronger. But in spite of whatever may have been said to that effect, sociology no more gives encouragement to the other side; neither meta- physical fact nor scientific law can replace what belongs to the order of values. And even those who fancy themselves able to 'establish' morality on the existence of God forget that this exist- ence, were it indubitable, could act only on those who already love the perfect Being, or at least have a fear of possible chastise- ments greater than their preference not to subordinate themselves to anybody. For Lucifer, the existence of God is indeed a reason for revolting against Him. But it does not follow from such con- siderations that sociology is powerless. In an objective manner it</page><page sequence="25">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE 25 can enlighten our wills as to the real situations and conditions in the midst of which they will exercise their choices. It is there- fore very true, as Bougle concedes, that "philosophy still has its role to play". But how many discussions on morals, between men who esteem each other, depend not on disagreement as to inten- tions but on different opinions as to the existing state of things, or the effects of such and such a mode of action, or the means of realizing the same goal! Just here sociology regains its utility for morals and serves efficaciously, in virtue of its objective knowledge which may be shared by all minds, the cause of the good will and of peace. And are not these the things of which men have the most urgent need today? ANDRE LALANDE THE SORBONNE</page></plain_text>
