MILES University of Virginia Kein Realist begniigt sich damit, immerfort zu wiederholen, was man schon weif3. (Bertolt Brecht) I would like to begin my remarks with a realism-test-one that helps demonstrate a major problem confronting any student of reality-principles in literature. Let me first give you a passage to be thinking about. I shall take it from Peter Handke's Wunschloses Ungliick, a short nonfiction novel that he wrote in 1972 about the suicide of his mother in Austria the year before. The passage refers to the conditions in her home as a child: Alles wurde noch mit der Hand gemacht. Da waren der gemiitliche Feuer- herd, die an allen Ecken geflickten Kochtopfe, der Schiirhaken, das Biugeleisen (das immer wieder zum Nachwairmen auf die Herdplatte gestellt wurde) .. Now the realism-test, which will consist of imagining yourself, in three steps, to be three different theorists of realism, each of them examining the passage from a different point of view. Step 1: Imagine that you are Georg Lukics. Does the passage remind you of reading the Odyssey in school? Do the hand-mended cooking pots and cozy stove remind you in subtle ways of Penelope's hand-made bed, of the shield of Achilles? Do you, personally, feel a strong sense of nostalgia whenever you contemplate hand-made objects-now forever lost to an age of machinery and "alienation"? Do the characters who own these objects in the story remind you not only of Odysseus, Antigone, and Aeneas, but also of Nekhlyudov? (If you don't know who Nekhlyudov was, don't worry; Brecht didn't either.) In short, do you feel that the passage em- bodies a true '"Widerspiegelung der objektiven Totalitait"?

Does the passage remind you of Beate und Mareile? If you haven't read this, do you at least feel, after putting the book down, that "the subjective experience is the only objective experience," that the epitome of 19th century realism, in other words, is not Buddenbrooks-but Leutnant Gustl? Step 3: Imagine you are Andrei Zhdanov, at the conference on socialist realism in Moscow in the 1930's. Does a tractor appear in the text? A girl in denim? What would capitalist formalists say about the passage- that the author is a "mimetic terrorist," suffering from a "representation- compulsion"? A Wirklichkeitsfanatiker? If so, the passage probably em- bodies socialist realism. One could obviously go on with this little game and make up more questions and parodies, but I think that the point is clear: There is not just one realism, but many. Our examples represent only three: Lukacs' objec- tive realism, Brinkmann's subjective realism, and Zhdanov's socialist realism; but there could be many more. One man's realism is clearly another man's myth. I would like to argue here, however, that most theories of realism in Germany can be reduced to two main traditions or models, and that these are in turn dialectically related to one another- indeed, could not exist without the other. To focus my argument, I shall concentrate on three texts: Erich Auerbach's Mimesis (1946), Lukacs' "Erzaihlen oder beschreiben?" (1936), and Handke's Wunschloses Un- gliick. Let us begin with Auerbach. Auerbach suggests that realism-in con- trast to classicism and its hierarchical separation of styles-involves a radically "mixed style," in social content as well as linguistic form. In the French novelists of the 19th century there is a radical mingling of the social classes-town and court-as well as of levels of speech. This radical mix, according to Auerbach, can be traced back through Shakespeare as far as the New Testament. Whether set in a manger in Bethlehem or a boarding- house in Paris, realistic works stress "the portrayal of the everyday processes of life," including "everyday objects and utensils"-much as in the example from Handke we had stoves, cooking pots, and flatirons. Beyond the notion of a "mixed style," however, Auerbach tends to be rather silent about what he understands by realistic "mimesis"; one searches in vain for a "discourse on method" in the book. Each chapter, for example, after opening with what is essentially a French explication de texte, then leaps to the level of what is essentially German Geistes- geschichte. Not only are the connections between the two methods tenu- ous, connections between the chapters themselves remain obscure as well (the famous first chapter, for instance, barely connects with the rest of the</page><page sequence="3">Reality and the Two Realisms 373 book). In fact, after reading over 500 pages in the book, we discover with some dismay that even Auerbach's subtitle (The Representation of Reality in Western Literature) was misleading; for he suddenly confesses to us that he was not interested in a history of European realism, nor was he interested in "entering into hopeless discussions concerning the definition of realism." Yet in spite of the disclaimers, I think that one can discover a definition of realism behind Auerbach's analyses, and that we can even put our finger on the specific theorist lying behind this definition: Hegel. For Hegel's analysis, in the Aesthetics, of the "representation of reality" in ancient Greek literature-particularly in the Odyssey-is obviously Auer- bach's model for his analyses throughout all of Western literature. Only the names have been changed, not the structure or the theory. In place of Hegel's "classical" mixture of the everyday with the sublime, we merely have Auerbach's "realistic" mixture. Where Hegel viewed Greek realism as having come to an end in the inwardness of the Christian Gospels, however, Auerbach singles out the Christian world-view in particular as a remarkably "ruthless" mixture of the everyday with the sublime, and proceeds to celebrate this union of styles down through the next 2,000 years of literary history until it "collapses," as he puts it, in 1927, with Virginia Woolf s To the Lighthouse (which, we should recall, appeared just a few years before Auerbach started writing his book). Recognizing Hegel's model in Auerbach's analyses not only helps clarify his method, but also helps relate his work to that of Georg Lukics. For despite the blatant differences-Lukacs' Marxist determinism obvi- ously contradicts Auerbach's radical historicism-the approaches of both men actually constitute two examples of the same kind of realism, both of them being anchored in Hegelian aesthetics. Both Lukics and Auerbach were raised in the 19th century German idealist tradition; both were exiled in the 1930's, as Jews, by Hitler-Lukacs to Moscow, Auerbach to Istanbul; and, most importantly, both dedicated precisely those years of exile to studies of realistic literature-an act expressing not only a per- sonal commitment to the liberal traditions of the 19th century (the world of their childhoods, their intellectual Heimat) but also a political protest against romanticism, that specific form of irrationalism which later blossomed, in Auerbach's own words, into the "loathsome flowers" of Nazism, or, in Lukacs' better-known phrase, into Nazism's "destruction of reason." Let us turn to Lukacs. If Auerbach suppressed his theory of mimesis, then Lukacs virtually wallows in it: Rene Wellek has taken masochistic delight in counting the phrase "Widerspiegelung der Wirklichkeit" 1,032 times in the first volume alone of Lukacs' Asthetik. As its "central aes-</page><page sequence="4">374 Miles thetic category" (Die Eigenart des Asthetischen), Lukics' theory of realism selects a concept which he calls "Besonderheit" or specialness, but which is actually nothing more than the notion of the Aristotelian concrete universal, whereby the general discloses itself only at the heart of the concrete object. "Das Allgemeine" and "das Partikuliire," as Hegel puts it in the Aesthetics, must become one: "Nature is not merely earth and sky in general, man does not hover in the air; he feels and acts in a specific locality of brooks, rivers, and hills." Homer here is the grand example, steering his steady course between empty generalities and concrete detail; he "affords us such an accurate picture of the Scamander river near Troy," for instance, "that even now the same can be found by geographers" (see "Das Zusammenstimmen des konkreten Ideals mit seiner aulf3erlichen Realitiit" in the Asthetik). The aesthetic equivalent of Hegel's concrete universal is obviously Goethe's symbol, whereby "das Besondere das Allgemeine repriisentiert," where the poet "schaut das Allgemeine im Besonderen" ("Maximen und Reflexionen," italics mine). Agamemnon's sceptre in the Iliad-to employ an example of Hegel's-is precisely such a "realistic symbol," representing the general (the entire family line of descendants) within the particular (the carefully described staff itself, including how it was hewn). Lukiics employs other Goethean concepts as well in describing his theory of realism, namely "Gestalten" and "Erziihlen." Both of these concepts are used to designate the true realism of such 19th century writers as Balzac and Tolstoi, and to denigrate Zola, Hauptmann, and all other decadent naturalists and modernists who indulge, in Lukics' words, in consumer catalogs of things, shallow naturalistic "reports" and docu- mentaries for the masses, fetishistic and boring "descriptions." In the words of his famous essay, Lukics' genuine realists are Erziihler-not Beschreiber. In sum, three of the concepts at the heart ofLukics' theory of realism are identical with those of Auerbach: (1) the Hegelian insistence on the elevated portrayal of everyday events in the Homeric sense; (2) the belief in the centrality of the Goethean symbol for such narration; and (3) the historical grounding of the entire scheme in 19th century French realism, in particular with Balzac. I would like to turn now to the other tradition or model of "realism" in German theory, the tradition that leads to Brecht and Handke. Lukfics himself perhaps best describes this tradition in his attack on it as Be- schreiben. In this kind of writing, he states, mankind's most pressing problems seem to vanish under a "blanket of minute particulars." "The peripheral begins to bloom everywhere" and universals are gobbled up, as in Kafka, by concrete, sordid details. "The mud on Napoleon's boot," as he says, quoting Hebbel, "is portrayed as painstakingly as the spiritual</page><page sequence="5">Reality and the Two Realisms 375 conflict in his face." This "realism" that Lukics is so busily denouncing, however, is none other than that which Roman Jakobson and the Russian Formalists of the 1920s called "progressive" or "revolutionary" realism (see Jakobson, "On Realism in Art"), or, later, "metonymic" realism (Jakobson, Fundamentals of Language). This model, growing out of 19th century realism, defines itself by its defamiliarization, deconstruction, and distortion of all inherited models of what was once presumed to be "reality." A central method in this estrangement or alienation from what had become routine is the close-up (analogous to what was transpiring in early films at the turn of the century, as Eisenstein points out in several of his essays). The progressive realist, Jakobson asserts, is precisely "fond of dwelling on the inessential detail," for a new angle on the world. In rhetorical terms, this style of realism is "metonymic" (deriving from the rhetorical figure of metonymy, in which an adjoining detail stands for the whole, as in Kafka's "skirt"-chasers, who are "women"-chasers, or a Western's hired "gun" who is a hired "gunman," etc.). Jakobson's famous example is from Tolstoy, the scene where Anna Karenina commits suicide by throwing herself under a train. Instead of giving us an overall portrait of scene and person, Tolstoy focuses unsettlingly on an adjoining detail, Anna's small red handbag; we get two random close-ups of the handbag before she finally flings it into the snow just before falling in front of the train. (Note: This close-up or metonymic style of realism connects directly with Walter Benjamin's meditations on the modern "allegorical" mode--the proliferation of the luminous "fragment" at the expense of the whole--but we have no time to go into this question at this point.) It is thus both typical and fitting that when Peter Handke makes his literary debut in Princeton in 1966 as the official enfant terrible of Gruppe 47 he launches his attack on the establishment with a denunciation---not of their faulty Erziihlen, as Lukics undoubtedly would have done--but spe- cifically of their inability to describe details and things (their Beschrei- bungsimpotenz). Where Lukacs had privileged Goethean Erziihlen and Gestalten (in "Erzahlen oder beschreiben?" and "Gestaltung oder Reportage?"), Handke expressly valorizes Beschreiben: "Ich bin fir die Beschreibung. . ." (Ich bin ein Bewohner des Elfenbeinturms) as well as Reportage: "Das Buch hier konnte man also eine Reportage nennen; es ist keine Erziahlung..." (Das Gewicht der Welt). With all of this in mind, let us turn once again to our earlier passage from Handke's Wunschloses Ungliick--this time in its entirety, however, with all of its adjectives inserted, which I suppressed at the first reading to render it more tradi- tional. In actuality, all adjectives in the passage are printed in boldface, much like giant billboards or enormous advertisements for the things. Upon reading it, note the obvious attack on at least three aspects of</page><page sequence="6">376 Miles traditional, Lukicsian realism: (1) its fetishization of preindustrial objects, (2) its mistaking of a romantic anthropomorphism--the personification of objects-for a robust and "realistic participation" of the observer, and (3) its general nostalgia for what Brecht scornfully called "the good old days": Keine Maschinen im Haus; alles wurde noch mit der Hand gemacht. Gegen- stande aus einem vergangenen Jahrhundert, im allgemeinen Bewultsein ver- klirt zu Erinnerungsstiicken... der GEMUTLICHE Feuerherd, die an allen Ecken geflickten LUSTIGEN Kochtopfe, der GEFAHRLICHE Schiir- haken, die TATENDURSTIGE Unkrautsichel ... If by now we haven't gotten the point, Handke tells us what it is, cautioning us at the end of his "epic" list: "woran wieder nur die Aufzihlung das Heimelige ist." The coziness and homeyness of the scene exists only in the sentence itself, not in the world in some real-life kitchen; the idyllic realism of the whole passage is an illusion pulled off by 19th century adjectives. The passage, including its parody, works on multiple levels: The billboard adjectives not only mock their 19th century forebears but also (1) jolt the reader like Brechtian theater billboards, alienating him from what he earlier thought was "realistic" and "natural"; (2) bring about this deconstruction of bourgeois literary consciousness by employing its own methods-namely ADVERTISING-like Warhol's gigantic hyperrealistic CAMPBELL SOUP CANS; (3) function, much like erlebte Rede or interior monologue, to bring us closer to the mother's thoughts, the dead stereotypes which inhabit her mind; and, finally, (4) unveil for us the mother's real tragedy: namely, the fact that actual experience had vanished for her behind a heap of empty cliches-family sayings, schoolgirl games, local business advertisements, and credos of Nazi politicians. A life of her own-an occasional adjective of her own (not always a "cozy" hearth)- might have helped save her from her early death; but it never came. The prison-house, or death-cell, of received language closed slowly around her and never let her go again: "Miide/Matt/Krank/Schwerkrank/Tod," as one of the village games for schoolgirls had it; this was her life "script." That Handke states explicitly that his mother grew up in surroundings which were "pre-1848" in outlook is just one more thrust at Lukacs' "realism," whose classical period was precisely that golden, Goethean age in which politics and aesthetics were "whole." There are many more examples of Handke's "progressive" realism in the book-the title itself, with its simple inversion and unmasking of the bourgeois clich6 of being "wunschlos gliicklich," as well as the opening and closing pages with their implicit critique of even the hard-core, zero- degree realism of Camus' L'Etranger-but it is time to turn now to the problem of how the two traditions of realism, Auerbach's and Lukics' Hegelian model on the one hand, and Handke's and Brecht's Jakobsonian</page><page sequence="7">Reality and the Two Realisms 377 one on the other, relate to one another. One way of demonstrating this is to refer to recent work in linguistics in which two opposing schools have emerged with regard to the exact description of literary "style" (see "Linguistic Approaches to Literature" in Donald C. Freeman's Linguis- tics and Literary Style). The first of these groups we can call the Style-as-Recurrence group, and would designate all of those critics-like Lukics and Auerbach-who would fasten on various recurring norms to define a "style." Handke's "cozy hearth"' '-once we have reduced the adjective to its normal printed size-would qualify here as a good example of this style of realism, for it represents a topos from that enormous repository of recurrent, everyday commonplaces by which Lukics and Auerbach would characterize the realistic style. I should add, however, that this view does not have to be either as narrow as that of Lukics nor as historically sweeping as that of Auerbach (who would include among his "realists" even Dante, who conjures up for us nice everyday scenes such as a three-headed devil imprisoned in ice and munching on Judas). In fact, this notion of realism as recurrence has recently been pursued with a great deal of ingenuity by Peter Demetz, who has applied semiotics and the concept of Wiederholung to a whole set of 19th century texts (Neue Rundschau, 1977). The opposing school might be called the Style-as-Deviation group, for, as the name indicates, they define style primarily as "deviation" from a given linguistic norm. Handke's "ENTERPRISING sickle," with its devi- ation from the normal usage of "enterprising," not only unmasks the romantic pathetic fallacy lying behind so much of Lukics' "realism," but also defines Handke's own style as a realism of linguistic defamiliarization. Like Brecht (without the ideology, however, much as Auerbach is Lukaics without his ideology), Handke would create a constantly changing "real- ism," ("progressive," in Jakobson's terms), one which constantly "makes strange" our everyday perceptions. In Brecht's words, this realism would include all works which "nicht wiederholen, was man schon weir, sondern die der Wirklichkeit immer neue Seiten abgewinnen." In Harry Levin's phrase, it is the realism of "systematic disillusionment." In place of a prescriptive aesthetics for young realists ("be sure to install a 19th century 'cozy hearth' in the living room") we have a permanent revolution on the artistic front----or, better, a radical hermeneutics: a theory based on ways we continue to interpret and reinterpret-through texts-the changing historical world around us. My point in all of this, however, is that the two realisms, be they based on the notion of recurrence or on that of deviation, are essentially in- separable. "Deviation" (as in Handke's parody) necessarily posits some norm or recurrent pattern from which it can deviate,just as any "recurrent pattern" or topos must presuppose a welter of deviations in order for it to</page><page sequence="8">378 Miles make sense. The two realisms are locked in a form of "negative" dialectic in which there can be no synthesis, just their constant interplay in the course of what the Germans call history, and the French, "intertextual- ity." Each mode, by its very repression of the other, implies the other, and is thus bound to it, historically (diachronically) as well as aesthetically (synchronically).* *After writing this paper I discovered that my theory of the "two realisms" is confirmed in part by Schiller in Uber naice and sentimentalische Dichtung. The true "Realist," says Schiller--our own traditional Homeric narrator-"baut seine Einsicht auf die Wiederkehr dihnlicher Fiille," not, he adds, "auf die Regel des Augenblicks"--on something "was sich zum erstenmal darstellt." The latter is obviously our "progressive" realist, the realist of the luminous fragment or "snapshot" detail. Furthermore, as evidence of the eternal dialectic of the two realisms, there is Handke's own latest work, Langsame Heimkehr (1979). In this he is concerned with the everydayness of "repetition"-"Sinn fur Wiederholung kriegen!" exclaims his hero. The movement of the story is a would-be but slow "Heimkehr" to feelings of Gleichmaft, Dauer, and Geschichte (to everyday "repetition" in the sense of Kierkegaard and Stifter, to style-as-repetition in the sense of Auerbach and Lukics). In his attempt to progress "beyond" the style-as-deviation of Wunschloses Ungliick-to leave himself and his critics behind-Handke has merely confirmed our theory: there is no escaping the dialectic of the two realisms; despite all their flamboyant infighting the two modes of discourse form a linguistic conspiracy, and whoever tries to escape the one will soon find himself face to face with the other.
