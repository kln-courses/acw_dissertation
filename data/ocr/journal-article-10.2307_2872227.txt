<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PATTERN OF CONVERSION IN SARTOR RESARTUS BY WALTER L. REED It is no longer possible to complain that Carlyle's Sartor, Resartus is unjustly neglected. It was in its time a popular book, particularly among young men in search of self-under- standing and reassurance. Froude has testified eloquently to the appeal of Carlyle to the young of his generation,' in a way that suggests the popularity of Hesse, Camus, or Vonnegut today. Such immediate appeal has long since faded, as with so many things Victorian, but recent academic criticism has shown a renewal of interest in Carlyle's first major work. Sartor seems to be benefiting from a general revaluation of Victorian literature, a tendency among critics to take seriously the aesthetic, as well as the moral and religious achievements of Victorian writers. While the precise genre of the book is still not clear (it can hardly be called a novel), its imaginative coherence and literary value have been argued for convincingly by a number of books and articles in the last several years. My own interpretation of Carlyle's work continues a process of critical exploration begun by men like G. B. Tennyson, Albert LaValley, and George Levine.2 My thesis is that there is a unifying pattern in Sartor Resartus, a pattern which is important in other works of English literature of the nineteenth century as well. The central pattern, or rather the main symbolic action, of Sartor Resartus is a process ' Thomas Carlyle: A History of his Life in London (London, 1884), I, 291-96. 2 Tennyson, Sartor Called Resartus (Princeton, 1965); LaValley, Carlyle and the Idea of the Modern (New Haven, 1968); Levine, The Boundaries of Fiction: Carlyle, Macaulay, Newman (Princeton, 1968).

McMaster, " Criticism of Civilization in the Structure of Sartor Resartus, UTQ, 37 (1968), 268-80; and Jaques Cabau, Thomas Carlyle, ou Le Promethee Enchaine (Paris, 1968). Broader studies which include interesting discussions of Sartor are John Holloway, The Victorian Sage (London, 1953); Morse Peckham, Beyond the Tragic Vision (New York, 1962); Eugene Goodheart, The Cult of the Ego (Chicago, 1968); and Masao Miyoshi, The Divided Self (New York and London, 1969). Walter L. Reed 411</page><page sequence="2">of conversion. The religious experience of a 'turning around,' not so much Christian as Romantic, is embodied and expressed in the book's imaginative form. I The obvious place to begin a discussion of the role of conversion in Sartor Resartus is with character of Teufelsdrbckh and the spiritual upheaval he undergoes in the concluding chapters of Book Two, the famous "Everlasting No," " The Centre of In- difference," and " The Everlasting Yea." What exactly happens here? The young hero undergoes an experience which consists of three clearly defined stages. In " The Everlasting No " he dis- covers the active power of his own selfhood and denies, violently, the power of a mechanistic universe over him. Still indignant and defiant, he goes through the " Centre of Indifference," a period of wandering and observation where he turns his attention from himself to the world at large, from the " Me " to the " Not-Me," as Carlyle puts it (170) .3 Finally, in " The Everlasting Yea," a spontaneous and quite gentle movement of the spirit occurs in him and he awakes to " a new Heaven and a new Earth " (186). A fiery, apocalyptic self-affirmation and denial of the universe, a period of objective neutrality, then a gentle awakening to a regenerated world. This three-fold process-really a two-fold revelation-is identified as a " conversion " by Teufelsdr6ckh him- self. " ' Blame not the word,' says he; 'rejoice rather that such a word, signifying such a thing, has come to light in our modern Era, though hidden from the wisest Ancients '" (198). While the spiritual dynamics of the process are clear, the doctrinal impli- cations of it are not. There are those, like G. B. Tennyson, who see Teufelsdrockh's conversion as a religious experience informed by orthodox Chris- tian traditions. But the Augustinian pattern of a " trial of the center" which Tennyson adduces does not accurately describe what Carlyle's hero has undergone. Augustine's center is a point of crisis, a spiritual nadir from which the soul arises to salvation. Carlyle's center is not a point of crisis at all but a time and space of " indifference," " through which," Carlyle says, " whoso travels from the Negative Pole to the Positive must necessarily pass" 3 All references to Sartor give page numbers in C. F. Harrold's edition (New York, 1937). 412 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resartus "</page><page sequence="3">(182).4 In fact, there seems to be no clear Christian pattern behind Teufelsdr6ckh's conversion. The Calvinistic or Puritan pattern, with its clearly defined sequence of spiritual events, is no more relevant than the Augustinian one.5 One is forced to agree with Basil Willey that " the Christian reader will notice, in all this, a lack of conformity with the established pattern of conversion: there is no contrition, no reliance upon grace or redeeming love, but on the contrary, much proud and passionate self-assertion." 6 If Christian tradition and doctrine fail to provide a model for the spiritual dynamics of conversion in Sartor, more psychological accounts of religious experience are not much more helpful. A. C. Underwood has classified Christian and non-Christian conversions according to three basic types, intellectual, moral, and emotional. Teufelsdrdckh's experience, with its lack of philosophical dogma and its lack of moral contrition, is clearly of the third type, where " the primary thing is not a clarification of thought, nor an accession of moral ability, but a reorganization of the emotional life around a new centre." 7 William James in The Va7ieties of Religious Experience also speaks of the self organizing its struc- ture around a new center during conversion. The problem one encounters in applying these definitions to Sartor is that in Teufelsdrdckh himself the center is almost impossible to determine. One searches in vain for any central point or principle, new or old, in his character as it is presented in the book. As a hero, Teufelsdrockh remains ambiguous and obscure, in spite of the Editor's biographical labors. He is a composite figure as he appears to the reader, a loose assemblage of character types and archetypes-the Foundling Child, the Young Werther, the Wandering Jew, Faust, Prometheus, and so on. 4 Sartor Called Resartus, pp. 295 if. Tennyson's diagram skews the pattern by invoking a hypothetical " turning point " between the No and the Centre. In fact, the No and the Yea are both instants, with the Centre an interval between them. 'See Perry Miller, The Neu) England Mind: The Seventeenth Century (Cambridge, Mass., 1954), pp. 280-99. Carlyle's Calvinism is of course not the same as New England Puritanism, but Miller's analysis is the clearest description of a Calvinistic paradigm of conversion. C. F. Harrold finds the main Calvinistic element in Carlyle to be social rather than psychological, his doctrine of " the totalitarian or corporate community " (" The Nature of Carlyle's Calvinism," SP, 33 [1936], 57-92). 6 Nineteenth Century Studies (New York, 1949), p. 115. Willey is referring primarily to the Everlasting No here, but his remarks apply to the rest of the conversion process as well. ' Conversion: Christian and Non-Christian (London, 1925), p. 148. Walter L. Reed 413</page><page sequence="4">There is nowhere apparent what Kierkegaard calls "c that inmost and holiest thing of all in a man, the unifying power of person- ality." 8 Although he remains a positive heroic presence in the book, Teufelsdrdckh anticipates a negative, sinister figure like Melville's Confidence Man, who appears as a series of masks or masquerades instead of as an integral self. What psychological traits Teufelsdrockh is given are patently typical, or as the Editor puts it "c generic " (100) If one turns from religious to secular examples, however, one can find sources for Carlyle's conception of conversion. Interest- ingly enough, these sources deal less with the development of the person than with the growth of society. There is a definite influ- ence of German Romantic theories of history on Carlyle. Rene Wellek has noted how " the conception of a dynamic evolution of alternating periods" was common to many of the German writers Carlyle had studied-Herder, Novalis, and Goethe.9 These periods of negation and affirmation are movements in the history of Western society rather than in the growth of an individual soul, but they are clearly analogous to Teufelsdrdckh's "No " and " Yea." As Wellek has observed, there is a " psychological affinity to the individual need for conversion" in Carlyle's own treatment of historical development.10 An even closer parallel to the Carlylean pattern can be found in another context in Goethe. As a commentator on Faust puts it, " It was . . . Goethe's belief that all action was the effect of the juxtaposition of positive and negative poles. Around either pole standing in isolation, there was void; but set the two poles opposite each other, and there would be interaction." ' When one thinks of the emphasis Carlyle puts on action as the means and sign of personal salvation, and of the way the Everlasting No and the Everlasting Yea are seen as negative and positive polarities, the debt to Goethe seems clear.

Wellek is responding to Hill Shine's Carlyle and the Saint-Simonians (Baltimore, 1941), which sees a somewhat different conception of historical periodicity as a basis for Carlyle's views. Wellek argues that the French models " must have struck Carlyle as a corroboration of ideas he had already held and had met with in the Germans" (p. 99). 0 Wellek, p. 106. 1 Charles E.

And for Carlyle to incorporate the ideas of others was to achieve neither fictional form nor imaginative experience. In the period of his literary apprenticeship before he began Sartor we find Carlyle writing in his Note Book: " There is just one man unhappy; he who is possessed of some idea which he cannot convert into an action, or still more which restrains and withdraws him from action."-Goethe. Wie wahr! " The end of man is an Action not a Thought."-Aristotle. How many eulogies of Activity, and Nothing acted! 12 A crucial part of the conversion Carlyle himself underwent, as Carlisle Moore has shown, was the actual writing of Sartor Re- sartus. In 1821 or 1822 in Leith Walk, Carlyle had undergone a dramatic revelation similar to what he describes in " The Ever- lasting No." But the Everlasting Yea, if one accepts Moore's argument, was slow in coming. It was not the experience of a moment, but the net result of a long period of struggle, a series of emotional recoveries and relapses which took place over a decade. What is particularly interesting in Moore's account of Carlyle's own conversion is the idea that it was only in the writing of Sartor itself that the sense of affirmation was fully achieved. Only by adopting a more creative stance toward the materials of German Romanticism does Carlyle seem to have completed his conversion. " Until what he had learned from the Germans be- came his own he could not use it, and until he could use it nothing like the Everlasting Yea was possible. The achievement of the Everlasting Yea and the writing of Sartor were thus intimately connected." 13 I would take this assertion one step further and say that in Sartor Resartus Carlyle simultaneously realizes and dramatizes a process of conversion. The conversion is not so much a private religious experience, happening prior to the recording of it, as 12 Two Note Books of Thomas Carlyle, ed. Charles Eliot Norton (New York, 1898), p. 81. 13 " Sartor Resartus and the Problem of Carlyle's 'Conversion,"' PMLA, 70 (1955), 680. According to William James's typology, this experience would qualify as the "volitional type " of conversion (as opposed to the " type by self-surrender "), where "the regenerative chance is usually gradual, and consists in the building up, piece by piece, of a new set of moral and spiritual habits. But there are always critical points here at which the movement forward seems much more rapid" (The Varieties of Religious Experience [New York, 1902], p. 206). Walter L. Reed 415</page><page sequence="6">an imaginative creation, a symbolic action worked out in literary form. As such, it is close to the imaginative conquests of " doubt " undertaken by Victorian poets like Tennyson in " In Memoriam," Browning in " Pauline," or Arnold in " The Scholar Gypsy " and " Thyrsis," where the poetic process is a crucial part of the poet's emotional recovery.14 The form Carlyle's conversion takes, while alluding to religious tradition and drawing on German models of historical change, is a peculiar creation of his own. What I should like to do now is show how this process of conversion is expressed. It To organize the discussion we may distinguish three levels on which the conversion process operates in Sartor: the level of language, the level of narrative form, and the level of social vision or cultural myth. We can best begin by considering the language or style of Sartor. One of the most notable features of the book is the proliferation of metaphor, metaphors of clothing, light, fire, water, trees, seeds, and so on. It is the characteristic of metaphor to express one thing in terms of-or as if it were-- another; the logical connection or analogical link between the two entities is suppressed. To speak of metaphor in general as a kind of conversion is thus possible, though hardly necessary. In the case of Carlyle's metaphoric style, however, the term is especially appropriate because of the peculiar way the style works. Carlyle's metaphors almost always perform one function: they transform dead material fact into living spiritual truth. They are less an expression of aesthetic perception than of religious conviction. "I think I have got rid of Materialism," Carlyle wrote in his Note Book about the time he was writing Sartor. " Matter no longer seems to me so ancient, so unsubduable, so certain and palpable as Mind. I am Mind: whether matter or not I know 4 A. Dwight Culler has pointed to a similar dialectic of negation and affirmation in Arnold's poetry and notes the similarity with Carlyle in Imaginative Reason: The Poetry of Matthew Arnold (New Haven, 1966), esp. pp. 3-6. See also Tennyson, p. 166 and n., on the " three-fold " pattern in Carlyle. In Arnold, as Culler explains it, there are three dialectical phases: an early positive phase, an intermediate negative phase, and a later positive phase. While in his broader vision Carlyle sometimes places emphasis on a primary positive phase, in the crucial experience of conversion he pits the last two phases, negative and positive, against one another, reducing a triadic sequence to a binary opposition. This shift in dialectical structure is very important, as we shall see. 416 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resartus "</page><page sequence="7">not-and care not." Only a little earlier he had written, " All Language but that concerning sensual objects is or has been figurative. Prodigious influence of metaphors! Never saw into it till lately."'5 Taken together, these two comments reveal the underlying bias of Carlyle's interest in metaphor. Many con- temporary writers, even Transcendentalists, were fascinated by the concrete, sensual basis of language, as revealed in etymologies and dead metaphors. Carlyle's admirer Emerson, for example, wrote that " Every word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if traced to its root, is found to be borrowed from some material appearance." 16 Carlyle is much more jealous of the primacy of the spiritual in language. A characteristic effect can be seen in the following comparison: "To breed a fresh Soul, is it not like brooding a fresh (celestial) Egg . . ." (88). The spiritual side of the equation is redoubled by the apprehensive "celestial," as if to keep the physical connotations of the analogy firmly subordinate. This metaphorical conversion is not a simple operation, but an ongoing, dynamic process in the book. A good example is the following paragraph on metaphor itself: 'Language is called the Garment of Thought: however, it should rather be, Language is the Flesh-Garment, the Body, of Thought. I said that imagination wove this Flesh-Garment; and does not she? Metaphors are her stuff: examine Language; what, if you except some few primitive elements (of natural sound), what is it all but Metaphors, recognized as such, or no longer recognized; still fluid and florid, or now solid-grown and colorless? If those same primitive elements are the osseous fixtures in the Flesh-Garment, Language,- then are Metaphors its muscles and tissues and living integuments. An unmetaphorical style you shall in vain seek for: is not your very Attention a Stretching-to? . . . Moreover, there are sham Metaphors, which overhanging that same Thought's-Body (best naked), and deceptively bedizening, or bolstering it out, may be called its false stuffings, superfluous show-cloaks (PIutz-Mdntel), and tawdry woollen rags: whereof he that runs and reads may gather whole hampers,- and burn them.' (73-74) Teufelsdrockh, the author of this paragraph, begins with a conventional phrase-language as the garment of thought. He ' Two Note Books, pp. 151, 141-42. 16 Nature, in The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Centenary Edition (Cambridge, Mass., 1903), I, 25. See Tennyson, pp. 261-67, for an excellent analysis of Carlyle's use of metaphor. Walter L. Reed 417</page><page sequence="8">goes on to make the metaphor more substantial: Language is the " Flesh-Garment " or " Body " of thought. The spectre of materi- alism is thus raised, but this " descendental" turn (to use the Editor's phrase) is only a preparation for the " transcendental " upswing: " I said that imagination wove this Flesh-Garment." The argument continues by focussing on metaphor as the main constituent of language and identifying it as the " living tissue " (as opposed to the non-living bones) of the body. Materialism again confronted, and the living distinguished from the dead. A final distinction is made between true and false metaphor as the argument returns to its point of departure. True metaphor is the body, false metaphor merely the clothing of the spirit. The paragraph ends on an apocalyptic note with the suggestion that the false trappings may be stripped off and burned. The Editor's comment-" Than which paragraph on Metaphors did the reader ever chance to see a more surprisingly metaphori- cal "-reminds us how the different figures have been manipu- lated, to the extent that the original tenor and vehicle are virtually indistinguishable. What we are left with is not a clear picture of the logical or analogical relationship of language to thought, but a sense of the power of the creative imagination to transform the physical substances of nature and culture into reflections of itself. How, we might ask, does this reflect the pattern of conversion we have observed in Sartor? In the way it divides the world into positive and negative polarities, the dead material on the one hand and the living spiritual on the other, with metaphor as the intermediate space between them. Meta- phor is the " Centre of Indifference," in fact, for the No of matter and the Yea of the spirit. It is of neutral value in and of itself, but it is the means of transformation, or conversion. We have said little so far about the controlling metaphor of the book, the metaphor of clothing. The motive of conversion and the dynamics of the double revelation are likewise evident here. In and of themselves, clothes are a neutral fact and figure. They constitute an indifferent center, a realm of objective phe- nomena which do not necessarily threaten the self or support it. But the " Clothes Philosophy" which uses the metaphor is not a passive doctrine; it is an active process of vision and a means of reducing the universe to anthropomorphic form. On the nega- tive side of the indifferent center, corresponding to the " Bap- hometic Fire-baptism " (168) of the Everlasting No, the clothes 418 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resartus"</page><page sequence="9">metaphor is used for the purposes of satire and apocalypse. As in satiric tradition, clothing suggests false appearances, worn-out or unjustly assumed facades. As in the Book of Revelation, these veils may be consumed in apocalypse, which means literally 'a stripping away.' When Teufelsdrockh proclaims that " Society is fouiaded upon Cloth," he is able to strip society bare: " the Clothes fly-off the whole dramatic corps; and Dukes, Grandees, Bishops, Generals, Anointed Presence itself, every mother's son of them, stand straddling there, not a shirt on them . . ." (61) . The use of the Clothes Philosophy for apocalypse is counter- balanced, however, by its use for the purpose of regeneration, where new fabrics are imagined to veil the naked spirit. Just as the destructive fireworks of the Everlasting No were succeeded by the gentle awakening of the Everlasting Yea, the stripping away of old clothes is followed by a weaving of new ones. Here clothes are seen not as artificial but organic; they express a super- natural truth rather than hiding a natural one. As he is speaking of the decay of " Church Clothes " in Book Three, for example, Teufelsdrockh hints that religion " is weaving for herself new Vestures, wherewith to reappear, and bless us, or our sons or grandsons " (216). Like the Everlasting No, the apocalypse is dramatic but not final. New appearances are generated, quietly and mysteriously, to replace the old and the process of conversion is carried on. The three-fold sequence of negation, indifference, and affirma- tion in the Clothes Philosophy can be seen most clearly in the sequence of chapters toward the end of Book Three which bring this Philosophy to its triumphant conclusion. In the chapter entitled " The Phoenix " Teufelsdrockh envisions the fiery con- summation of a society already dead. Although there are hints of regeneration, the emphasis is on destruction. In the third chapter of this sequence, " Organic Filaments," regeneration emerges as the dominant theme: " In that Fire-whirlwind, Creation and Destruction proceed together; ever as the ashes of the Old are blown about, do organic filaments of the New mysteriously spin themselves " (244) . In between these two chapters is the apparently irrelevant chapter " Old Clothes," where Teufelsdrockh recalls wandering through a second-hand clothes market in London. This digressive interlude is the center of indifference to the two points of revelation on either side. In a similar way, the division of Sartor into three books is Waitegr L. Reed 419</page><page sequence="10">governed by the pattern of conversion. George Levine has argued that much of the material in Books One and Three is interchange- able,'7 but the overall tone and intention of these two sections is really quite opposite. Here we come to the question of the narrative form of Sartor Resartus, the second of the three levels on which we promised to show conversion at work. Conversion operates in the style through metaphors, both local and general. It also operates in the relationship of the sceptical English Editor to the visionary German philosopher. I shall discuss this question at some length because it seems to me the main fictional device of the book, the basis for any claim Sartor has to being considered as a work of fiction. The peculiar narrative form of Sartor, where an uncommitted narrator reflects on an engaged or committed hero, is one which is used widely in the middle and late nineteenth century. In this respect, Sartor has much in common with books like Moby-Dick, Wuthering Heights, Lord Jim, Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time, and even Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling. In all these works, the interaction of narrator and hero is an important constituent of their meaning. In the beginning of Sartor the Editor is reluctant to publish Teufelsdr6ckh's Clothes Philosophy. He has received a compli- mentary copy of his book, Die Kleider, ihr Werden und Wirken, but he is unwilling to present it to the English public. " To state the Philosophy of Clothes without the Philosopher," he says, " the ideas of Teufelsdrbckh without something of his personality, was it not to ensure both of entire misapprehension?" (11). Then the Editor receives the promise of biographical documents from Herr Heuschrecke. Only at this point does the project of Sartor Resartus crystallize in the Editor's mind. Because he is continually hoping to receive these biographical materials, which he thinks will provide an easy access to Teufels- dr6ckh's ideas, the Editor resists the Clothes Philosophy itself. Throughout Book One he complains about the chaos of Teufels- drockh's writing. He objects to the " idle, wire-drawing spirit " of the philosopher. " One of the most unsatisfactory Sections in the whole Volume is that on Aprons," he says in introducing a chapter on that subject (43). When he does find something to praise, as in the chapter " Miscellaneous-Historical,'" he seems to fasten on the most literal-minded and uninspired section of the '7 The Bondaries of Fiction, p. 63. 420 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resartus,"</page><page sequence="11">Clothes Philosophy. As C. F. Harrold's footnote points out, Carlyle has borrowed extensively here from a seventeenth-century German compiler. The pedantry is obvious, and it indicates that the Editor prefers literal fact to metaphorical vision. Book One thus dramatizes the Editor's denial of the Clothes Philosophy. The denial is hardly emphatic enough to be called an " Everlasting No "-the Editor is much more tentative than Teufelsdrockh-but it is clearly a stage of negation in their relationship. The narrator denies the full significance of the hero's works. Like Teufelsdrdckh himself confronting the universe and finding it meaningless, the Editor turns away from the volume before him. Book Two is an intermediate phase, a center of indifference, in that the Editor leaves the Clothes Philosophy aside. He tries to go behind Teufelsdr6ckh's opinions to his life. Thanks partly to Herr Heuschrecke, he is frustrated in this search for the his- torical Teufelsdrdckh, for when the supposedly clarifying docu- ments arrive they turn out to be more chaotic and obscure than the Clothes Philosophy itself. In the " Six considerable PAPER- BAGS " (77), the letter again overwhelms the spirit of Teufels- drockh's testament. Like Teufelsdr6ckh in his own Centre of Indifference, the Editor gathers a wealth of objective information without being able to assemble it into significant form. The Editor lets Teufelsdr6ckh speak for himself in much of Book Two, and he learns a good deal about the main events of his hero's life: his mysterious birth, his schooling, his legal apprenticeship, his unhappy romance, and his Wanderjahre. But the Editor is dissatisfied with the detached and enigmatic nature of these revelations. He can find no sign of the incipient Clothes Philosopher in the purely " generic" picture the hero presents. Finally, after describing Teufelsdrdckh's conversion, the Editor seems to undergo a conversion himself. That is, he undergoes the second movement in the Carlylean process of conversion, the movement of affirmation. He decides, simply and spontaneously, to abandon his biographical researches and return to the Clothes Philosophy. He assents to Teufelsdrdckh's opinions and, in effect, adopts his methods: henceforth he will consider all the docu- ments as " symbol " and " hieroglyph." He will approach his hero through the documentary " clothing " of his writings, instead of trying to go behind this clothing to some less mediated vision of his person. The Editor announces his own change of heart when Walter L. Reed 421</page><page sequence="12">he says, " The imprisoned Chrysalis is now a winged Psyche" (204). Like Teufelsdr6ckh's Everlasting Yea, this movement of affir- mation is spontaneous and unselfconscious. It is partly the result of the Editor's having imitated Teufelsdrbckh's struggle. His editorial labors over the chaos of the volume and the documents parallel the labors of Teufelsdrbckh in facing the chaos of the modern world. The Editor " retailors the tailor " and recapitu- lates in the world of letters what the hero has accomplished in the world itself. That this transformation is a genuine one, that the Editor is truly converted to Teufelsdrizckh's vision and can participate in the Everlasting Yea, is borne out by the difference between Book One and Book Three. In Book Three the Editor is clearly in command of his materials. He is able to expound Teufelsdri5ckh's doctrines with a new confidence: " Significant Indications stand- out here and there; which for the critical eye, that looks both widely and narrowly, shape themselves into some ground-scheme of a Whole" (208). He no longer laments the disorganization of ideas: " Let us, omitting these high transcendental aspects of the matter, study to glean (whether from the Paper-bags or the Printed Volume) what little seems logical and practical, and cunningly arrange it into such degree of coherence as it will assume " (218). No longer resisting the Clothes Philosophy, the Editor actively helps to shape and direct it. Here he even supple- ments the Philosophy proper with relevant materials from the biographical Paper Bags. The imaginative distance between the Editor and Teufels- drockh has thus been narrowed. The conversion of the Editor which occurred at the end of Book Two is dramatized as a con- vergence of the two identities and the two roles as Book Three progresses. The geographical distance between them becomes less and less marked. There are first several passing references to visits Teufelsdrdckh has made to England in the past. At another point the German philosopher mentions a visit to Edinburgh; it was here, he claims, that he was first inspired to write a philo- sophy of clothes. In Chapter X the roles of editor and philosopher are reversed. Teufelsdrbckh has received by mail a " Fashionable Novel " from England. He is as puzzled by Bulwer Lytton's description of the Dandy as the Editor was by Teufelsdrbckh's own volume. It is the Editor, now speaking in his own right, who 4922 The Pattern of Ccmversion in " Sartor Resartws "</page><page sequence="13">explains the significance of the Dandy for the Clothes Philosophy. Finally, in the last chapter, we learn that Teufelsdr6ckh has dis- appeared from his retreat in Weissnichtwo, and the Editor offers his " private conjecture, now amounting almost to certainty (297) that Teufelsdrdckh is at this moment in London. Albert LaValley comments on this conclusion that Carlyle "collapses his hoax by revealing that he is both the editor and Teufelsdrdckh and ultimately projects Teufelsdrdckh as a sort of mythical superman into London society." We may return here to the biographical question of the role of Sartor as a, vehicle of conversion in Carlyle's own life. In the context of his literary career the book turns him away from his passive, subordinate role of editor, translator, and reviewer to the more active primary role of historian and social prophet which he assumed after leaving Craigenputtock for London. As LaValley puts it, " Carlyle will now try to play Teufelsdrbckh to an urban society in crisis."' 1- To the extent that Carlyle was able to change from editor to social visionary the symbolic action of conversion in Sartor may be termed a practical success. But there is a further level on which the dialectic of conversion operates-or tries to operate-within the fictional artifice of the book. That is on the level of social vision or cultural myth. We have seen how on the level of language and on the level of narra- tive form Saritor effects a conversion from negative to positive states. LaValley seems correct when he says that the primary emphasis of Sartor is on problems of the self and that only in subsequent writings like The French Revolution does Carlyle deal with society in depth. But the difference is relative rather than absolute. We have already mentioned Wellek's observation that the way Carlyle treats social revolution is related to his Is Carlyle, pp. 117-18. The question of a progression in the relationship between the Editor and Teufelsdrbckh has been debated. Tennyson notes a development somewhat similar to the one I have described, but does not see the pattern. He speaks vaguely of a " conversion " of the Editor to Teufelsdrbckh's views and finds that the Editor's writing is increasingly influenced by Teufelsdrickh's metaphorical style in the course of the book. George Levine argues that the tension between the Editor and Teufelsdrdckh is fairly constant throughout; he rejects the notion, offered by Morse Peckham, of a "psychological continuity" in the development of the characters. Miyoshi, The Divided Self, p. 144, feels that the Editor " is gradually being converted," but also feels that a tension is maintained throughout the book. "oCarlyle, p. II S. Walter L. Reed 423</page><page sequence="14">concern with personal conversion. Conversely, even in Sartoar, Carlyle attempts to dramatize society turning around from negative to positive form. III It is on the level of social vision that something becomes apparent which is latent in Sartor Resartus on all levels, the problematic nature of the conversion process. The problem has ultimately to do with the way an apparently progressive dialectic is really a binary opposition in disguise. Instead of being a genuine mediation, as in the Hegelian dialectic, the middle term in Carlyle's pattern is " indifferent," merely a neutral passageway from one pole of energy to another. Instead of an ongoing dialecti- cal process where immediate, positive stages of the spirit are succeeded by negative, reflective stages, these leading in turn to a higher positive immediacy, we have a more ethical conflict of negative and positive, of good and evil, where genuine syn- thesis does not seem possible. Although Carlyle often appeals to " action," labor, or work as mediating functions, action itself tends to be divided into destructive and creative phases. Thus as one moves from the microscopic to the macroscopic view of Sartor's fictional form, the " centre of indifference" be- comes more obviously indifferent, increasingly less necessary and less effective in producing the desired conversion from negative to positive experience. On the level of language, the device of metaphor is the least indifferent, the most efficacious kind of mediation. It is instrumental in the conversion of material facts into spiritual truths. The very frequency of the metaphorical transformations, however, does betray a sense of instability and inconclusiveness in the process. On the level of narrative form, the conversion of the Editor to the philosopher-hero's position is less fully and completely dramatized. Conversion here has a reductive potential. Is the Editor raised to the level of the hero, or is Teufelsdroickh reduced to the level of an editor, when all is said and done? Teufelsdr6ckh is a prototype for what Carlyle called " The Hero as Man of Letters," a version of the heroic in history which is peculiarly modern and peculiarly problematic as it tries to embody the force of action in the written word. It seems possible to argue on these lesser levels that conversion is a largely successful and positive experience in Sartor. 20 But 20 See, for example, Eugene Goodheart, The Cult of the Ego, p. 75: " The irony 424 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resartus "</page><page sequence="15">Carlyle aspires to dramatize conversion on a broader scale. He aims ultimately at creating a social myth which will show society turning away from the negative, rationalistic phase it has gone through in the Enlightenment toward the positive, mystical phase which seems to be heralded by Romanticism. England, in particular, is to be! converted from French scepticism to German faith. This ambition is reflected in the treatment of society in the different books of Sartor. Book One is by and large a negative vision of society, a radical critique of all existing social institu- tions as mere clothing. "The beginning of all Wisdom is to look fixedly on Clothes, or even with armed eyesight, till they become trarsparent," Teufelsdrbckh is quoted as saying (67). This descendental method, of course, leads to a transcendental in- sight into the spiritual mysteries of nature. But society in general is treated in Book One as a superficial covering over a more posi- tive and more profound world of nature. As far as a myth of social order is concerned, Book One represents the initial phase of the conversion process. Book Two is again the \ indifferent center. Teufelsdr6ckh is exposed to a wealth of social data, from his early experiences in Entepfuhl to his later global wanderings, but this raw material is never shaped into any coherent pattern. In Book Three, however, the positive phase of the social vision begins. Here Teufelsdrbckh attempts to recover society as an organic and spiritually grounded reality, just as he recovered an organic and spiritual universe in the Everlasting Yea. This movement of recovery and affirmation begins with a single heroic figure, George Fox, who is seen as translating spiritual faith into creative act when he makes himself a suit of leather. From this central point the subsequent chapters expand concentrically out- ward-first from Fox's suit to " Church-Clothes " in general, then from the importance of religious forms to the importance of all social symbols. " It is in and through Symbols that man, con- sciously or unconsciously, lives, works, and has his being " (922), writes Teufelsdrockh, rephrasing Acts 17.28. The substitution of " Symbols," social rather than poetic, for God here is sympto- matic of the way society is now seen as a positive spiritual force in human affairs. In the chapter " Helotage " which follows [of SaTtor] is never destructive, nor is the extravagant manner of presenting Teufelsdrickh necessarily an indication that Carlyle intends irony." LaValley, on the other hand, stresses the negative qualities latent in the book. Walter L. Reed 425</page><page sequence="16">" Symbols," the Editor and Teufelsdrbckh confront and overcome the hostile influence of Malthus' purely mathematical view of society. The sequence of " The Phoenix," " Old Clothes," and "Organic Filaments," as described earlier, consolidates this process of conversion, recapitulating the pattern of destruction, indifference, and recreation. This account leaves us, however, with four more chapters in Book Three before the final "Farewell." What happens in " Natural Supernaturalism," " Circumspective," "The Dandiacal Body," and " Tailors "? G. B. Tennyson sees "Natural Super- naturalism " as the thematic climax of Sartor and the remaining chapters as a " coda . . . perhaps even marring the symmetry " of the whole.2" While it is true that " Natural Supernaturalism " is a magnificent transcendental statement, it is important to see that the previous chapter, " Organic Filaments," is really the conclusion of the Clothes Philosophy as we have seen it used. Beyond this point the center of indifference fades out of Carlyle's dialectic. The center loses its metaphoric value as both " Natural Supernaturalism " and the remaining " coda " diverge from the clothes metaphor in opposite directions. The conversion sequence in fact reverses itself. We get a positive statement in "Natural Supernaturalism," a neutral center in " Circumspective," and a negative conclusion in " The Dandiacal Body." None of the last three chapters in the book is able to make any significant reaffir- mation of the myth of society. This reversal of the pattern perhaps needs more explanation. In " Natural Supernaturalism," as the Editor says, " the interior celestial Holy of Holies lies disclosed " and " the Philosophy of Clothes attains to Transcendentalism " (225). The dynamic process of conversion has been completed, and the metaphor of clothing is by and large abandoned. Instead of converting society, returning it to its spiritual foundations, Teufelsdrockh here looks beyond social and cultural realities to a realm of spirit pure and absolute. The myth of society is simply transcended. The chap- ter " Circumspective " constitutes a minimal center of indifference and attempts to revive the idea of the Clothes Philosophy. " The Dandiacal Body" which follows returns to the subject of society and the topic of clothing, but these are treated with a new literal- ism. The Dandies are overdressed, the Drudges or Poor-Slaves 21 Sartor Called Resartus, p. 302. 4926 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resartus "</page><page sequence="17">are underdressed. Clothes become a sign of economic inequality rather than an imaginative metaphor. "The Dandiacal Body," furthermore, presents an essentially negative vision of the social order. It predicts class warfare between the Dandies and the Drudges, a prophecy which anti- cipates Marx. The usual order of events in the conversion process is thus reversed. Spiritual reassurance comes first, materialistic conflict comes last. The final chapter before the concluding envoi, " Tailors," tries to effect some kind of mediation between the leisure class and the rural poor by singling out the condition of the craftsman or artisan. But the tailor is himself a figure of aliena- tion in modern society, and the idea of clothing here loses all of its former metaphoric value. It is as though in the face of im- mediate and actual social problems the " Centre of Indifference " has been usurped by the two opposite poles of force. We are left not with an accomplished conversion but a mutual antagonism between a transcendental reality and a descendental social situa- tion. The most one can say for Sartor here is that it launches Carlyle into the main stream of social events where he may at- tempt the process of social conversion more directly. By engaging contemporary history too directly and literally, then, Carlyle violates the imaginative pattern which informs the book as a whole. When the symbolic acLion insists on a more literal application it loses its clarity and definition, and even reverses itself. There are other smaller scale attempts by Carlyle to " convert " society in Sartor Resartus, however, and these attempts are more interesting in the way they vary Lhe pattern we have been observing. They show conversion in another form, a form which is perhaps implicit in the dominant pattern all along. An example of this variant form of conversion can be found in Carlyle's treatment of the steam engine, the backbone of an Industrial Revolution which was causing increasing dismay among writers of the age. Teufelsdrbckh speaks of the steam engine as "the Scottish Brassmith's IDEA (and this but a mechanical one) travelling on fire-wings round the Cape, and across two Oceans; and stronger than any other Enchanter's Familiar, on all hands unweariedly fetching and carrying: at home, not only weaving Cloth; but rapidly enough overturning the whole old system of Society . . . (118). Carlyle does to industrialism what Marx was to do to Hegel's idealism: he stands Walter L. Reed 427</page><page sequence="18">it on its head.22 He can be affirmative about the social upheaval he sees going on around him in England because he is able to ground it in a single man's " idea," thus basing the whole process on spirituality. One may easily object that this is a genetic fallacy, that because James Watt invented the steam engine originally it does not follow that the mechanistic forces thereby unleased are still under his control. But in the fictional medium of Sartor Resartus, a negative force has been converted to a positive one. What is notable here is that conversion has been brought about by inversion-a turning around becomes a stand- ing on the head. A more significant example of this form of conversion appears at the end of Book Two, where Teufelsdr6ckh is discussing the " Society for the Conservation of Property." As Harrold's foot- note explains, Carlyle is alluding to Locke's political theory of a society based on the right of private property, a social system of which Carlyle himself was critical. " Some one's doing, it without doubt was; from some Idea, in some single Head, it did first of all take beginning: why not from some Idea in mine? " (200). Teufelsdr6ckh suggests that he thought up the system of European society. In a playful and oblique manner, Carlyle stands Locke on his head: the empiricist description of the social order becomes an idealist account of society's orgin. In his Note Book Carlyle recorded a " Fable " which expresses this sense of conversion as inversion. An orator stands on his head in a public square and cries in alarm that the world is upside down. In the fable, the world and the orator are set to rights by someone standing the speaker on his feet. But the imaginative model of turning something upside down leads easily to a less secure situation, where " revolution " takes place in the opposite direction. As Marx was to prove, standing a materialistic philo- sophy on its head was by no means the final word. One can also see how there is latent in the paradigm of conversion, or a lateral turning around, the paradigm of revolution, a turning upside down along a vertical axis. The difference is not merely one of geometry. If affects the whole idea of the possibility of growth and development through time. 22 Marx did not claim to stand Hegel on his head, as it is popularly supposed. He said rather that Hegel's system was standing on its head to begin with and that he was turning it right side up. See Walter Kaufman, Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary (Garden City, N. Y., 1965), pp. 399, 401, and compare Carlyle's " Fable " cited below. 4928 The Pattern of Conversion in " Sartor Resart '"</page><page sequence="19">There are other examples in English literature, Romantic and Victorian, of this proximity of conversion and revolution. Shelley's Prometheus Unbound begins with a psychological con- version of Prometheus not unlike the conversion of Teufelsdr6ckh in Sartor. Prometheus' first response to his punishment was to curse both Jupiter and the natural world, and the poem begins with the revoking of this curse, with a turn from denial to affirma- tion. The cosmic regeneration which follows takes the form not of conversion but revolution. Demogorgon arrives in Heaven and carries Jupiter " Dizzily down, ever, for ever down " into the abyss.23 Like the Carlyle of Sartor, Shelley is optimistic here about the ascendency of the good and the non-reversible nature of the revolutionary cycle. But one need only turn to Dickens for the darker vision which will haunt Carlyle increasingly after Sartor Resartus. In the opening scene of Great Expectatinms Magwitch holds Pip upside down by his heels, and this inversion becomes emblematic of Pip's misdirected quest for social eminence. Pip is emotionally turned around by his love for Estella, but his sense of values has been inverted. Throughout the novel-indeed, through all his later novels-Dickens rings the changes on a revolution of value where spiritual relationships are stood on their heads and material connections come out on top. If Carlyle envisions a restoration of the spirit in Sartor, Dickens confronts the possibility of a triumph of matter. Conversion and revolution, then, can be seen as forms of the nineteenth-century imagination as well as psychological and social phenomena of the age. There were other Victorians, like Matthew Arnold and George Eliot, who remained more true to the evolu- tionary, historicist, and Bildungs-spirit of Goethe and other German Romantics. Arnold and Eliot consider time as a medium for gradual growth and change, not as a " Time-Prince or Devil "' as Carlyle so often does (293). They emphasize reform rather than revolution; compare, for example, Eliot's treatment in Middlemarch of the period before the First Reform Bill with the attitude toward the same period in Sartor. They emphasize a 23 Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, ed. Lawrence Zillman (Seattle, 1959), III. i. 81. Harold Bloom, The Visionary Company (1961; rpt. Garden City, N. Y.: Anchor, 1963), p. 326, calls Demogorgon " a dialectical process, not a god." This would make Shelley's notion of revolution rather more complex than Carlyle's. Carlyle himself did not appreciate Shelley; see Roland A. Duerksen, Shelleyan Ideas in Victorian Literature (The Hague, 1966), pp. 123-25. Walter L. Reed 4929</page><page sequence="20">rational discrimination in thought rather than association by metaphor. " For we all of us, grave or light," Eliot writes, "get our thoughts entangled in metaphors and act fatally on the strength of them." 24 They accept literature as the successor of religion instead of trying, like Carlyle, to excommunicate litera- ture which cannot command religious belief. Carlyle's concern with sudden and complete transformation is shared by many English writers of the age, however. We have mentioned Shelley and Dickens already. There is also Browning, who describes his poetic art in The Ring and the Book as a chemical transformation, not a change of substance but of shape. The crude historical facts of the Old Yellow Book are converted into the shaped aesthetic truth of the poetic Ring. The poem presents itself as an effort to redeem a past event from material meaninglessness to spiritual significance-to free the spirit from the letter. The means of transformation here is Browning's own imagination, which acts as a temporary alloy, a medium which is ultimately a center of indifference: Just a spirt O' the proper fiery acid o'er its face, And forth the alloy unfastened flies in fume; While, self-sufficient now, the shape remains, The rondure brave, the lilied loveliness, Gold as it was, is, shall be evermore: Prime nature with an added artistry- No carat lost, and you have gained a ring. What of it? 'T is a figure, a symbol say. ...25 Whether or not literary artistry can really effect, or even describe, such radical transformations, conversions, or revolutions is a question that disturbs Carlyle much more than it disturbed Browning. After Sartor, Carlyle becomes increasingly disenchant- ed with the art of fiction and turns to the writing of history as a more valid kind of literary endeavor.26 But in Sartor Resartu8 Carlyle works out an imaginative pattern which transcends such disenchantment, which shapes his own experience and tries to 24 Middlemarch, ed.

The pattern of conversion is a " symbolical myth," to use his own phrase, for himself and for the age.27 The tendency of the pattern to shift away from con- version toward revolution is not so much a sign of weakness in his own imagination as a sign of his growing away from his German and Romantic models and evolving English and Victorian forms of his own. Traces of the pattern of conversion remain in his later writings, but coming to the height of his literary powers, Carlyle turns his attention to the French Revolution as the paradigmatic experience of the modern age.
