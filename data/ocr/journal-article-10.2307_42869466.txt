On this occasion the Museum was reopened after a large scale renewal of its scientific conception and material presentation. Besides collections from East and South Africa, Western Himalaya, Surinam and South America, the Museum also contains a major Inuit collection, which by its quality and quantity (it consists of about 500 exhibits) is the most significant of its kind in the German Democratic Republic. The history of the "Völkerkundemuseum Herrnhut" has been closely related to the activities of the Moravian Brothers. In 1722 refugees from Bohemia and Moravia who left their homeland in the wake of counter-reformatory persecutions, were granted permission by Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700-1760) to settle in a place that later became Herrnhut (Saxony). Ten years later the first missionaries, ordinary working men, began to leave Hermhut for other countries. In 1732, they reached the West Indies, in 1733 they began their activities in West Greenland, and in 1770 they were at work among the Inuit of the Labrador peninsula. Among the "souvenirs" that were brought to Herrnhut over the years and remained in the possession of families, were many ethnographic objects, that were not put together until the second half of the 19th century and the awakening of scientific interest in ethnology. Museums were set up in Leipzig (1869) and Dresden ( 1 875) and in Herrnhut too, one was not unaware of the need to preserve valuable ethnographical material that would have inevitably disappeared if it had remained scattered among missionaries' families. Bernhard Kinne, a Herrnhut apothecary called for the setting up of a Museum Foundation that would bring "enjoyment and education" to the general public. Kinne's plea did not go unheeded and the first ethno- graphic exhibition was opened that same year, 1878. In the following years, the number of exhibits grew to such an extent that in 1900 a new building had to be erected. Since 1959, the Herrnhut Museum has been receiving scientific assistance from the Staaliches Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden. Through this sponsorship, modernization of exhibition rooms and improvement of the scientific content was made possible despite limited material means. In January 1975, the Herrnhut Muesum was formally annexed to the Staaliches Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden. It thus became possible to pursue jointly scientific research and popular education (which from its inception had always been the primary goal of the Museum). The 1978 reorganization of all departments in the Museum represents the first concrete achieve- ment of the new administrative structure.

These collections come mainly from West Greenland, Eastern Labrador and South West Alaska (Lower Kuskokwim) - all areas where the Moravian brothers were (or still are) active. There are some two hundred objects on display and most of these exhibits illustrate areas of material culture: house building, domestic implements, clothes, hunting equipment, means of transportation etc. A few objects concern intellectual life: little anthropomorphic wooden sculptures, shamanistic implements etc. However, since shamanism was opposed by the missionaries on the grounds that it expressed "heathen" beliefs, what was related to it seemed in their view to be hardly worth collecting. Although we are fully aware of considerable differences between Inuit of various regions, it appeared necessary for the sake of visitors' understanding to concentrate on generalizations. Explanations stressing the regional characters of an object were undertaken only where it seemed essential - e.g. for the different boat models that are exhibited. The exhibition presents an overview of Inuit culture as it stood at the turn of the century. However, the introductory document as well as captions for each group of objects deal with the changes that have affected the Inuit way of life up to the present. Photographs and plates (for instance reproduced from Hans Egede's "Des Alten Grónlandes Neue(r) Perlustration" , 1742) document modern way of life and traditional hunting techniques. Visitors are generally more impressed by large size objects - in particular the Greenland kayak and the Labrador dog team. Slides describe the steps in the building of an igloo and the use of the qulliq. It would be beyond the scope of this note to elaborate on all the exhibits, but the toys section is certainly worth mentioning. This collection comprises model lamp, pot, bowdrill, harpoon, ulu, sledge and kayak. 136 / INFORMATIONS SCIENTIFIQUES</page><page sequence="3">Between June 1978 and September 1979, the little Museum in Herrnhut welcomed 21 .700 visitors. It thus fulfills a significant educational function, especially among school-children for whom guided tours are organized on demand. More information on the Museum may be obtained from a catalogue that will be published in 1979.</page></plain_text>
