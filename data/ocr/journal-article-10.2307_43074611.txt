<plain_text><page sequence="1">344 Wisdom and the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia Benjamin R. Foster - New Haven The purpose of this inquiry is to review the Adapa material and assem- ble it into a coherent unity. We hope thus to be able to go beyond the still fragmentary data to describe the place of Adapa in Mesopotamian literary tradition, and to discover what the Adapa legend can reveal about the formation and content of that tradition. For convenience of presenta- tion we set up three categories of Adapa material: wisdom, magic, and myth. The boundaries of these categories will fade into each other within the Adapa tradition when it is set against that of Mesopotamia as a whole, and should assume their true perspective when the one is fitted into the fabric of the other. The greatest obstacles to precise interpretation are the fragmentary state of the texts 1 and their millennial time span, not to mention the ob- scurity of some of their key passages2. We begin with Adapa the wiseman. Despite the complexities inherent in that term 8, we can distinguish two aspects of the ancient wiseman: 1 Texts of the Adapa myth; A. T.

Speiser ANET2 101. 2 One of the potential hazards of a synthetic presentation of a Mesopota- mian myth is distortion by failure to relate the available material to the passage of time. At first glance changes in the outlook of the scribes, to whom we know our knowledge of Adapa, seem glacially slow, and their conservatism invites a unified presentation suspended in some vague time. Although there is little to go on, we will not avoid an attempt to arrange the Adapa material into a sort of chronological order. 3 Discussion of the term "wisdom" in literature by W. G. Lambert, Baby- lonian Wisdom Literature (Oxford: 1960), 1 if. Quite a different approach is that of E. A. Speiser, "The Idea of History in Ancient Mesopotamia" Section vii, reprinted in Oriental and Biblical Studies (Philadelphia: 1967) 305ff., and briefly W. A. Irwin in J NES 2 (1943) 225. The broadest definition of all by E. Gordon in BiOr 17 (1960) 123, "all literary writing current in ancient Mesopotamia. . . where content is concerned in one way or another with life and nature, and man's evaluation of them based either upon his direct observation or insight". None of these deals with just what a wiseman was thought to be, but together they show how protean "wisdom" has become as a literary term.</page><page sequence="2">Wisdom and the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia 345 the one as he moved about in the world of practical affairs, the other as he breathed in the rarified atmosphere of scribal scholarship. In the first case we see a man who leads lesser men out of seemingly hopeless dilemmas, solves baffling riddles, and meets any exigency with ingenious devices. Such competence is ideally sought and utilized by men with political power, whose competence is often of quite a different sort 4. Adapa's wisdom in practical affairs attracts our attention in various parts of the tradition. So great was his fame in this respect that one did not hesitate to make him assistant to Ea himself, the god whose genius articulated the very world order: He was the sage whose word no one despises Able, with broad knowledge of what belongs to the gods, Holy, clean of hands, priest ardent in every observance: With the bakers he did the baking With the bakers of Eridu did the baking The food and drink for Eridu daily prepared. With his own clean hands he arranged the offering table. Nor were the portions removed without him. He steered the ship, did the fishers' tasks for Eridu. Then would Adapa of Eridu While Ea [the king] stretched out on his couch See each day to the door bolt of Eridu. Ea's advantage lay in his knowledge of the ways of heaven, knowledge that Adapa, a mere mortal, could not have5. A second case of a god's reliance on wisemen in practical affairs is provided by a difficult text which portrays the seven wisemen as custodians 4 The terms for ' 'wiseman" ( apkallu ) and "expert, scholar" ( ummiânu ) were sometimes interchangeable. The former meant most often someone of remarkable intellectual attainments, and only sometimes a craftsman (W. G. Lambert AfO 18, 399). ummiânu could also mean "master craftsman" as in the Yale Gilgamesh Tablet iv. 29, and is the term used for the royal vizier or chancellor in the Assyrian epics (Weidner, AfO 20, 114), although the title could also mean "craftsman of the temple" at Assur, G. van Driel, "The Cult of Assur", Studia Semitica Neerlandica 13, 177. 5 Text B, lOff. For the fisher's tasks, which to judge by the etymology of the term included drying and otherwise preparing the fish, Landsberger, J NES 8, 252 note 303, and A. Salonen, Die Fischerei des alten Mesopotamiens (Helsinki: 1970), 46-48, where this passage is discussed. These duties (šuhadakkú) were of particular interest to the author of the "Weidner Chronicle" (ed. Güterbock, ZA NF 8, 50 ff) where Adapa is referred to, unfortunately in a broken context. Fastening the door bolt was a topos in Mesopotamian poetry; note that before the institution of kingship the gods had to bolt the city gates themselves (Etana, Kinnier- Wilson' s line numbering 16-17, Iraq 31 [1969] 9, and note p. 12). When a poet wished to describe the state of a city at night, the bolted gates were his first image, Prayer to the Gods of the Night line 2 (Dossin, RA 32, 179ff.). I owe the restoration of 'Šar'- ru in line 17 to Ms. Maureen Gallery, which makes for good sense although to judge from the photo there is barely room for the sign.</page><page sequence="3">346 B. R. Foster of the "tablet (s) of destinies" for Nabu; they produce the tablet(s) when they are needed for incantations6. The Sumerian word borrowed into Akkadian for wisemen with such special status was abgal 7. In its most ordered form, tradition knew of seven antediluvian apkallu's, each of whom could be paired with a distinguished monarch, either in time or by direct personal association. As has been shown elsewhere, this scheme was a secondary development; what is of interest here is that Adapa was num- bered among the apkallu' s and was the most famous of them all8. His primacy in wisdom was characteristically coupled with primacy in time and his location at what was believed to be the oldest city in the world 9, and thence with the advent of civilization in Mesopotamia. The sources of this primacy cannot be reconstructed in detail; was he the wisest because he was the first in time, contemporary with the first king, because he was associated with Ea, or because of some achievement all his own? A suggested answer to this question will form the conclusion of this essay. Adapa's primacy in time relates him to the first antediluvian king, Alulim 10. This pairing is known from Hellenistic lists of antediluvian kings 6 LKA 146. Varying interpretations of key passages in this text by W. G. Lambert in BiOr 13, 144 and J. van Dijk in UVB 18 (1960) 48. It appears to be a myth introducing a group of incantations and poultices.

ME occurs as a professional designation in pre-Sargonic texts, e.g. CI L 20 obv. ii. 4' (Fara). 8 Briefly stated: Old Babylonian tradition admitted considerable variation in the names and order of the antediluvian kings, cities, and wisemen. Redactors of the kinglist added antediluvian material to take the list back to the beginning of time and make it complete. For the apkallu and antediluvian tradition in detail: J. J.

We see his primacy as well in the story of Oannes as told by Berossus, a curious lamination of the practical and scholarly sides of the wiseman that we are considering here 12. In this account Oannes - Adapa teaches rude mankind polity and the arts: the supreme expression of the practical side of the wise Adapa. Still within the category "Adapa as wiseman" we consider his place in the achievements of scribal scholarship. This was the side of the wiseman more of interest to Mesopotamian literary and professional men (bibliogra- phers, incantation experts) than to less educated people who still would have known his name proverbially 13. The scholarly side of Adapa's wis- dom is to be found in the attribution to him of the otherwise unknown work u4-sakarx an den-lil. Hence he takes his place among the distinguished ("staghorn" ?), Jacobsen AS 11, 70-71, with note 6. Another late text pairs Adapa and Enmerkar, H.

Text too fragmentary for connected translation. It appears to be a group of omens reported to the king in a letter, a practice amply documented in Assyrian times and discussed by A. L.

Hallo JAOS 88 (1968) 89. 12 This text is often referred to but the difficulties of its interpretation have been too easily glozed over by emendation. The current edition of the Greek text may be rendered as follows: "(He said:) There was in Babylon a great number of men (foreigners, who settled Chaldaea) who lived unorganized like wild beasts. In that primeval period appeared from the Red Sea to that very land of the Babylonians a monstrous creature called Oannes (so also Apollodorus relates), whose whole body was that of a fish. Under the head was formed a human head, underneath the fish head, and feet like the feet of men were formed from the fish's tail. The image of it is still preserved. He said this creature spent the day with men, ate no food at all, gave men instruction in writing, mathematics, all the different arts, community life in cities, foundation of tem- ples, legislation, and land measurement; showed them how to harvest grain and fruit: in short, all things appropriate to life in those days. Since that time nothing further has been discovered. At sunset that creature Oannes went back into the sea and spent the night in the ocean; it was amphibious. Later appeared other creatures similar to that one, concerning which he says he ex- pounded in the Book of the Kings. (He said:) Oannes wrote about ancestry and citizenship and gave that book to men". Text: F. Jacoby, Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker , Dritter Teil, C (Leiden: 1968) No. 680, p. 369.

An excellent repre- sentation of the fishman was published by V. Scheil, RA 15 (1918) 132 plate 3. The scribal etymology of the term Adapa as an epithet was noted by Lambert, op. cit., 74, i.e., u4-an ("Oannes") ù-tu-a-ab-ba ("Adapa", "born of the sea"). Hallo JAOS 88, 175-176 has compared u4-an with the incipits of literary com- positions. 13 E. Reiner, op. cit., 11. Examples of the name used as a cliche below note 29 and in AfO 19, p. 64.

Foster authors of the past whose names and works were catalogued by an anonymous scribal scholar for AssurbanipaTs library 14. The idea that their professions were founded on tradition of hoary antiquity was appealing to scribal scholars. They were interested in the history of their professions, proud of their own mastery and of the achievements of their predecessors16. The wonderful book that Oannes composed setting forth the arts of civiliza- tion belongs in this roster of the wiseman's achievements, though it has yet to be connected with a known work in cuneiform literature 16. The nature of the book suggests the scribes' conviction that Mesopotamian civilization was the achievement of literate men and that the continuity of civilization depended upon their cultivation of letters. Small wonder then that destiny and the functioning of institutions (me) were thought to be preserved on tablets, that civilization began with a book, and that Nabu, the patron of Babylonian scribal art, gained such an exalted place in the scholarly view of the pantheon 17. From the foregoing we think it clear that the Adapa tradition fits neatly into the popular notions of the wiseman, counsellor of kings, and the scholarly concept of the wiseman, the author of the most important books and founder of the craft. This latter was in turn a part of the larger "scri- bal cosmology", the interpretation of mankind's history from the point of view of arts and letters based on the unstated assumption that his greatest and most lasting monuments were literary rather than political or architec- 14 W.

This idea is still to be found in the Koran surahs 7.142,149,153 etc., where the notion is parallel to "tablets of destiny" mentioned in Daniel and Enoch, for which see the Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1st ed., s.v. "lawh". Besides the "book" (logē) composed by Oannes we note the tablets buried at Sippar before the Flood to preserve knowledge (W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard, Atrahasis [Oxford: 1969], 137). A late echo of that tradition is found in an Arabic cata- logue of texts and authors (end of 10th cen. A.D.): "Ka'b said (and I take no responsibility for this) that the first to write Arabic, Persian, and other writing was Adam. He wrote this on clay three hundred years before his death and baked it, so when the Flood befell the earth it was safe. Thus every people found their own writing and wrote with it".

Perhaps the scribe who made the list of wisemen and kings drew the conclusion that the kings came and went but that the crafts inaugurated by the apkallu's lived on18. As we move into the second category of Adapa material, that of magic, we must consider a group of texts that give instructions for the fashioning of magical figurines of the apkallu's for the purpose of cleansing a house or ridding a man of sickness19. The themes ring familiar: the capabilities of the apkallu's together with their special relationship to the exorcists' craft make them a natural source of assistance against demons. Adapa could break the very wing of the wind by the power of his word; he could there- fore break the power of the disease that plagued the patient 20. What is less familiar to our habits of thought in this category of Adapa material is the belief that the powers of the wisemen of old were somehow still acces- sible and not merely to be found in the continuing process of intellectual achievement or in their literary works that were available to be consulted. These powers were attracted by a simple technique universal in Mesopota- mian cult practice: fashioning of an image and the use of effective language to localize the desired presence in the image. The prescribed forms of the wisemen are of considerable interest to our present inquiry; there should be seven of them in various hues of clay each holding a staff in his right hand and with the left clasping his chest, sometimes wearing a garment of fish scales 21 . No one could fail to recall Berossus' description of the fish- 18 Mesopotamian concepts of permanence and antiquity discussed by F. R.

Woolley, "Babylonian Prophylactic Figu- rines", J RA S (1926) 689-713, who writes, "The figures were all of unbaked clay, sometimes handmodelled, sometimes cast in a mold; after drying many of them were dipped into a bath of white lime which deposited over them a coarse white skin, concealing most of the details of the figure, and on this the features, dress, etc., were roughly painted in black with occasional touches of red: in some cases the black details were painted directly on the reddish-brown clay, in one or two the whole surface was painted black".

Foster men and Adapa's special concern for fishing in the Eridu cult 22. Beyond this we cannot proceed with confidence. The fisherman was one of the principals in what we may call the "economic cosmology" of Mesopotamia. Two others would be the herdsman and the farmer. The fisherman seems the least well attested of the three, so we have to reckon with the loss of a body of Mesopotamian religious tradition centering on the sea and fishing, both salt and fresh water23. We suggest the connection of Adapa with fishing was another form of primacy: a recognition or recollection that an early alternative way of life in Mesopotamia to irrigation agriculture was fishing for the carp and other fish that teemed in the twin rivers and the marshes of the delta plain 24. Further, these fish scales lead us to inquire whether the apkallu* s were necessarily thought of in human form. We may suppose their earliest repre- sentation to be something resembling what Berossus attempted to describe, or, as a Middle Assyrian poet remarked: Where are the seven sages of the primeval ocean? The sacred carp who like their master Ea With sublime wisdom have been endowed? 25 In the Eridu cult 26 and the world of fishermen we can imagine a truly under- water Enki surrounded by a retinue of fishlike creatures; wisdom, like life itself (so even now evolution teaches) came from the depths of the primeval ocean. When wisdom became a more civilized (or urban) phenomenon, it assumed a more human form, in short, became political and scholarly. Anthropomorphism and rejection or de-emphasis of age-old totems and emblems is one of the most striking aspects of developing Mesopotamian religious thought 27 . As we look again at these magical figurines we may be 22 Text A. 15. 28 Salonen, op. cit.; M. Civil, "The Home of the Fish", Iraq 23 (1961) 154-175, and discussion of that text by Landsberger MSL 8/2 80-81, who inter- prets the home as a sacred pond. M. Cohen in a paper read at the American Oriental Society in 1972 argued the "home" was a fishtrap and the text a fisher- man's ditty to lure his prey. 24 Cf. Sir Max Mallowan in CA H, 3 ed., I/ 1 , 347: "The sum of the evidence makes it seem likely that the earliest inhabitants of southern Babylonia were in a simply organized tribal state when they first settled there, and that their means of livelihood was fishing". The extent of these marshes in antiquity cannot be assumed however, R. M.

The third category of Adapa tradition we have set ourselves to con- sider is myth. We define myth as truth in human form, so we can expect the form and substance of the Adapa myth to appeal to us directly28. Here was another example of Adapa's primacy; he was mortal man, not merely the author of a single book or the ancestor of a closed guild of pro- fessional men. Adapa was in the first place a king, first among men politi- cally, and a wiseman, first among them intellectually 29. His very perfection made his story of peculiar interest for his fate had thereby a universal validity. Yet he was withal a mortal not fit for heavenly things, and thus a representative man 80. Here it is necessary to pause for a few remarks on the interpretation of the texts of the Adapa myth. Of the extensive literature devoted to their sense and meaning we may note the following: E. Burrows, "Note on Adapa", Or 30 (1928) 24, argued that Ea wanted to ensure that Anu did not take his faithful retainer into his own service by giving him immortality. Burrows was one of the first to emphasize the significance of the incantation at the end of text D. T. Jacobsen, "The Investiture and Anointing of Adapa in Heaven", A JSL 46 (1930) 201-203, suggested that the food, water, gar- ment, and oil offered to Adapa were nothing more than traditional hospitali- happens that incantations are becoming more widely appreciated as a source of early mythological material that disappeared from the literary canons, J. van Dijk, VAS NF I, Einleitung , although the pairing of a particular myth such as this one with a specific ritual may in some cases be a late scholarly activity, W. G. Lambert, "Myth and Ritual as Conceived by the Babylonians", ĪSS 13 (1968) 104-112. 28 While we do not ignore the immense gulf that separates Mesopotamian thought from our own we cannot subscribe to the doctrine of "pre-logical thought" that sets so much stock in speculations written in Greek, an eloquent example of which will be found in H. and H. A. Frankfort. "'The Emancipation of Thought from Myth" in Before Philosophy (Baltimore: 1966), 237-263. The differences in understanding and approach in even such a small bit of myth as this in ancient times seem far too great to be subsumed under a label like "mythopoeic". 29 No better reflection of this time-honored motif in Mesopotamian tra- dition can be found than in the vaunt of tyrants that they united in themselves both the kingship of the whole world and the sum total of scholarly knowledge (Sennacherib, Assurbanipal, Sargon II), references conveniently assembled in the CAD s.v. apkallu. 30 Text B. 57, This may explain the problematic lexical reference a.da.ap = a-mi-lu, MSL 12.93. If this word is indeed Adapa then it may be a case of lexical excerpting from a literary text, possibly a version of this one, for that technique is amply documented in the i,ú series (cf. Civil, ibid. 15 If.). Occur- rence of the word in Igituh 1.107 as a synonym for "wise" reflects the cliché "wiseman" invoked often in letters to kings, royal inscriptions, and hymns ( CAD AHw s.v. apkallu, adapu).</page><page sequence="9">352 B. R. Foster ty. Anu decided to acknowledge Adapa's special status with the treatment suitable for a visitor. By consuming the god's food Adapa would have become one of them; this Ea foresaw and forestalled. F. M. Th. de Liagre Böhl, "Die Mythe vom weisen Adapa" WdO 2 (1959) 416-431 offered a wide-ranging philosophical discussion of the implications of the myth and its relation to other Mesopotamian myths. He gave admirable but heavily restored poetic translations of the texts. He was also author of a metrical analysis of fragment B to be found in JEOL 15, 149 ff. G. Roux, "Adapa, le Vent et l'Eau" RA 55 (1961) 13-33 made valuable observations on the importance of the south wind in Mesopotamian agriculture which he used as a basis for an ingenious explanation of why Tammuz and Gizzida were the two gods waiting at Anu's door: vegetation could not grow because the south wind was not blowing. Yet seven days seems short for a drought, even in a myth; were forty the figure we would be prepared to follow him with more enthusiasm. Anu was at first perplexed that Adapa should enjoy such special favor with Ea but resolved to treat him as such favor would deserve. With Adapa's explanation of his refusal to eat and drink Anu saw for the first time that Ea's good will had definite limits, for he did not wish his apkallu to enjoy more benefits than he already had. Anu laughed at his own misun- derstanding and at the mortal whose far-famed wisdom now looked rather pathetic. In text D 4-6 this was brought out more clearly when Anu ex- postulated amid loud laughter that his good intentions were thwarted by Ea's wiles. The irony of Adapa's situation appealed to his rather malicious sense of humor. In this version some of the sting was removed from Ada- pa's humiliation: heaven was shown to be too awesome a place for a man (7-8) and a statement was added that connected his ascent with the release of the Eridu priesthood from certain obligations, here for once a true etio- logical myth, whatever its motives. Some Mesopotamian tradition might have asserted that the gods were impartial to virtue, but more to the present context would be the assertion that the gods exploited virtue and made the greatest demands of the best men, either for their own comfort and convenience (Atrahasis) or merely to prove a point (Job). The clearest distinction between men and the gods was human mortality. The search for immortality was the one truly im- possible quest - the reader's knowledge of this makes the frenzied ram- blings of Gilgamesh seem even more hopeless than they would have been if one thought he had a chance of success; so too here the poet took pains to point out men are not immortal, thereby setting the stage for Adapa's lost opportunity 81 . The point of the story was clearer if the outcome was stated in advance. 31 Ziusudra is a special case which need not be considered here.</page><page sequence="10">Wisdom and the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia 353 If we take the Adapa myth as we now have it to be an "etiological myth", we would understand it as explaining why men are not immortal. Adherents to this view might have us believe that because Adapa missed his chance men will never have another; indeed, the implication seems to be that if he had eaten of the bread and drunk of the water men would all be immortal 32. We interpret the story differently and hold that the myth tells us that man can never gain immortality; if Adapa could not, superior man that he was, who could? The myth is in short a parable rather than an explanation. This story of an individual with a lesson for all mankind appeals to us most in its simplicity of substance and the possibilities it offers for broad interpretations still consonant with its language. This is in fact the hall- mark of the masterpieces of cuneiform literature and invites comparison to the narrative technique of "J", the anonymous reputed author of so much of the best of Genesis. With J simplicity was perhaps more artful, but his convincing dialogue, vivid but economically rendered scenes, and highly suggestive subject matter and motifs have some similarities with this bit of Mesopotamian mythology. We see no possibility for a further rapprochement of Adapa and Adam 33. Two problems remain to be considered: the chronological ordering of the Adapa materials and the reason why Adapa enjoyed the greatest repu- tation of all the wisemen of the past. For the first question we can offer only guesses based on common assumptions about the course of cuneiform literary development, and no firmer basis for our conclusions. To the earliest layer of the apkallu tradition we ascribe their fish-like traits, which to us suggested beliefs at home in the swamp country of southern Sumer, the area which urban civilization by-passed early in its development but which was never quite forgotten as the seat of the earliest civilized activity in Sumer. To the Old Babylonian period may well be dated the initial systematization of the antediluvian tradition to include Adapa, and perhaps even his portrait as the faithful steward of his god. The belief that Adapa 32 W. W. Hallo, J CS 23, 60; discussion of etiology by Reiner, op. cit. 33 E. A. Speiser has suggested that Adapa was the Mesopotamian prototype of Daniel, "Idea of History", op. cit. 310 note 6, and further suggests the name may lie behind that of Adam ANET 2, 101. This apparent contradiction illu- strates the many-sidedness of the Adapa tradition. Not all "original men" and "unfairly disgraced viziers" need be the same person, but their similar characters and situations and the similar motivations and styles of their "biogra- phers" have naturally invited such comparisons. Comparisons like these can be productive when they point up original features of either text that might go unnoticed otherwise, but detailed discussion of Adapa and various Old Testa- ment figures here would not be profitable. This is taken up by A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis (Chicago: 1942), 126ff, and a review of the massive biblio- graphy on this subject in older Assyriological literature by Furlani, op. cit. to which may be added F. Hitzel, Sprache und Sprachen Assyriens (Leipzig: 1871), 17 f.</page><page sequence="11">354 B. R. Foster was the author of literary works may go back as early as the Ur III or Old Babylonian period, when some literary catalogues were drawn up, but in the form available presently may be dated to the Kassite period, when in- trospective, even occult scholarship fluorished and the genealogy of insti- tutions was a matter of pride 84. The suggestion was made that the contents of magical and poetic texts may have been drawn freely from a wide spec- trum of tradition some of which was abandoned in more strictly academic formulations; in this case the relative age of the texts would be of less interest than the age of the materials included in them. We are left with the final problem: the source of Adapa's special repu- tation. We grant his wisdom and his presence at the genesis of civilization, but there was something else, and that was in fact the very reason he rose to the height he did and came closer than any man to the state of the gods. That was trespass, overstepping the proper bounds he was normally so careful to observe, offending the gods. Going beyond established designs can bring both greatness and disaster. A ground swell in Mesopotamian literary tradition evoked admiration for men's defiance of the gods, even if an occasionally pietistic scribal school preferred to emphasize the failure of excess rather than its potential greatness and spectacular accomplish- ments 36. Adapa belonged to that group of distinguished men of the past who had done more than heroic feats against other men (Lugalbanda, En- merkar) ; through a violent act he briefly crossed the border that divided gods from men, was saved from divine anger yet lost the prize of immortality, because, obedient man that he was, he followed his master's command. Therein lay the paradox of his triumph and his failure. It was these two faces of the same achievement that appealed to different segments of Meso- potamian popular and scholarly tradition. 84 Bibliography and dates of catalogues by W. W.
