SMITH Department of Anthropology University of Arizona Tucson, AZ 85721 ABSTRACT Zoomorphic iconography is a hallmark of Preclassic Hohokam red-on-buff pottery decoration, but quantified data have not been consistently collected by Hohokam archaeologists. This study presents an exploratory analysis of a tightly controlled set of data from several Preclassic Hohokam sites along the Gila River in central Arizona, including 133 whole vessels from mortuary contexts at the Grewe and Snaketown sites, and eight sites in the Gila Bend area. The data show a consistent preference for bird iconography among common vessel form classes across the region. These results support a shared ideology among different populations living in the GilaRiver basin before A.D. 1150, and merit further research. RESUMEN La iconografia zoomorfa es un sello caracteristico de la decoraci6n cerdmica Hohokam rojo sobre cafr del periodo Precldsico, desafortunadamente datos cuantificados sobre este aspecto no han sido recolectados consistentemente por los arque6logos de esta drea. Esta investigacicn presenta un andlisis preliminar de un conjunto de datos, estrictamente controlados, provenientes de varios sitios Precldsicos Hohokam localizados a lo largo del Rio Gila en la porci6n central de Arizona. De igual manera se incluyen en el andlisis 133 vasyas completas provenientes de contextos funerarios de los sitios Grewe, Snaketown y de otros ocho del drea Gila Bend Los datos muestran una constante preferencia iconogr6fica de pdjaros en vasijas deforma ordinaria a lo largo de la regidn en estudio. Estos resultados apoyan la nocidn de una ideologia compartida entre las diferentes poblaciones que habitaban la cuenca del Rio Gila antes de 1150 D.C. y que merecen una investigacidn mds profunda. Centuries earlier than elsewhere in the American Southwest, the Hohokam region produced images of life forms on all durable media-such as pottery, stone, and shell, and in rock art. Animal images were first painted on ceramic vessels sometime during the Pioneer period (A.D. 300-750) and, although they continued to appear through the Sedentary period (A.D. 950-1150), the most diverse and numerous depictions of animals were created by Hohokam potters during the Colonial period (A.D. 750-950). Life form images are not uncommon on Hohokam pottery. An inventory of 561 Preclassic red-on-buff whole vessels from cremations at Snaketown resulted</page><page sequence="2">224 SMITH in a total of 11 percent (n=61) that depict painted life figures. However, Hohokam archaeologists have not consistently analyzed quantified data on representational pottery decoration. Simple questions about frequencies of life forms on all painted pottery are usually unanswerable given the lack of information collected about these depictions. Distributions of life form motifs, across vessel form classes, within and between sites, and according to archaeological context would help to elucidate patterns in the archaeological record that are not currently recognized. This article explores life form representation on ceramic vessels from several Preclassic Hohokam sites along the Gila River in central Arizona. The primary data include 133 whole vessels from the Grewe site, Snaketown, and several sites in the Gila Bend area (Figure 1). The entire sample, including 100 red-on-buff vessels and 33 effigy vessels, is from Preclassic cremation burial contexts. A sample of the sherd collections from the three study areas was also studied. The middle and lower Gila River basin, from present-day Coolidge to Gila Bend, delineates the geographical limits of this study. The Gila River basin is an appropriate choice because the distribution of life forms across all media is more frequent here than anywhere else in the Hohokam region (Kelly 1978:62). The proliferation of life forms on durable materials coincides with broader patterns of cultural behavior in the archaeological record. Large-scale irrigation agriculture, ballcourt construction, and increasingly complex mortuary traditions characterize the beginning of the Colonial period. These contemporaneous shifts imply some level of social transformation and, considered together, all of these traits suggest a shared religious ideology (Wallace et al. 1995:604-605). THE SAMPLE A total of 133 whole vessels, including effigy vessels, composes the sample for this study. The institutions in which the collections are housed are the Arizona State Museum (ASM), Tucson; the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural His- tory (LACMNH); and the Western Archeological and Conservation Center (WACC), Tucson. All of the pots analyzed come from controlled archaeological excavations carried out by academic research institutions or private individuals. Limiting the primary data for this study to whole vessels from mortuary con- texts standardizes inter-site comparisons by eliminating many sampling problems related to vessel function-that is, all pots were last used in the mortuary ritual regardless of their original function. I assume, therefore, that selection criteria were similar. The sherd collections considered here, presumably from trash con- texts, are reviewed for the presence or absence of motifs in a preliminary attempt to look at differential distribution among archaeological contexts. In order to ex- amine the full range of functional issues of animal iconography on pottery, sub- stantial data from household and other everyday contexts would be necessary.</page><page sequence="3">Zoomorphic Iconography on Hohokam Pottery 225 A 0 II (I A LAMSTAM I a Phistordc sits * Modem city 44 Figure 1. The study area (after Gumerman 1991).</page><page sequence="4">226 SMITH The Grewe Site The Grewe site was first excavated in 1930-1932 by the Van Bergen-Los Angeles Museum Expedition to Arizona (VB-LAMEA). Limited results of these excavations were published (Woodward 1931), and more comprehensive site re- ports, though unpublished, are on file at the LACMNH (Los Angeles County Museum n.d.; Hayden 1931). Field correspondence (Hayden and Wetherill 1930- 1931), maps, and most of the whole vessel collection are housed in the LACMNH. Twenty-three whole vessels, including nine effigy vessels, composed the sample for this study. Fifteen of the whole vessels considered are housed at the LACMNH. A number of whole vessels were donated to WACC in the 1940s, including six discussed here. The remaining two vessels considered were recovered during the Grewe Archaeological Research Project (GARP), conducted by Northland Re- search, Inc., in 1995 (Smith n.d.). The sherd collection derives entirely from field notes (Los Angeles County Museum n.d.). Snaketown The Gila Pueblo investigations at Snaketown conducted in 1934-1935 pro- duced the first comprehensive publication about Hohokam material culture (Gladwin et al. 1937). The director of Gila Pueblo, Harold Gladwin, and his col- leagues selected Snaketown because they believed that its location in the Gila River basin was central to the Hohokam people. Furthermore, it appeared to have been largely undisturbed by pothunters. Over the next three decades, questions persisted over issues of Hohokam chronology, and ASM Director Emil Haury revisited the site in 1964-1965 (Haury 1976). Snaketown's central location, com- bined with the extensive data collections and subsequent analyses from both exca- vations, has led to its interpretation as the preeminent Preclassic Gila basin Hohokam site. Both excavations at Snaketown produced speculation about life form images on buffware pottery. The origins of life form images and negative painting puzzled the archaeologists excavating at Snaketown in large part because they had no antecedents elsewhere in the Southwest (Haury 1937:227). The Snaketown collection at ASM contains whole vessels from both the 1934- 1935 and 1964-1965 excavations, but most of the pots examined in this study are from the earlier excavations, which focused more on burials than houses. Sev- enty-seven whole vessels from Snaketown, including 16 effigy vessels, were ana- lyzed for this study. In an attempt to quantify distributions of life form motifs on sherds, Haury (1976:229-245) inventoried a total of 1,347 sherds from Snaketown that bore such motifs. This collection, considered for the present study, is the only compre- hensive, quantified set of sherd data on zoomorphic iconography available.</page><page sequence="5">Zoomorphic Iconography on Hohokam Pottery 227 The Norton Allen Collection Whole vessels from the Gila Bend area were excavated by Norton Allen, an amateur archaeologist who donated his collection to ASM in 1994. Allen exca- vated at numerous sites in central Arizona, and his detailed field records, photo- graphs, and maps provide good provenience information for the collection. Allen kept artifacts from any given site together, rather than trading individual pieces, thus ensuring the integrity of the collections. Thirty-three whole vessels from eight different sites near Gila Bend, including eight effigy vessels, were considered in this study. Photographs of some of the vessels from this collection are published in Wasley and Johnson's (1965:92-107) report on salvage archaeology in the Painted Rocks Reservoir. Allen's collection of sherds bearing life form images is an assortment of what appears to be only the more unusual depictions that he encountered. Common motifs, such as "flying birds" (Haury 1976:243-245), are not found among the sample. METHODS Whole vessels are historically the unit of choice for studying painted designs on Southwestern pottery. Amsden (1936) defined categories of layout and a de- sign vocabulary still used by archaeologists today. Some recent researchers have also developed creative methods of design analysis using whole vessels (Crown 1994; Lindauer 1988; Van Keuren 1999; Whittlesey 1987), and others have used whole vessels to answer questions outside the realm of design, such as patterns of use wear (Bray 1982; Hally 1983, 1986; Jones 1989) and standardization (Mills 1998; Pizza 1999). Although a great deal of sophisticated research in many areas has been carried out with sherd-based analyses, advocates of the use of whole vessels in studying ceramic design claim that control over vessel size and func- tion, completeness of designs, and unmixed archaeological contexts are critical to their studies (Lindauer 1988:76). Because most whole vessel collections are either in museums or held by pri- vate collectors, these data often present challenges and biases unique to their acquisition context. Private collections may have very little associated provenience information. This problem is also inherent in many museum collections, because they were often donated by private individuals. An assemblage of whole pots may be mixed because the collector sought representative samples from different sites and time periods. The result of such mixing, of course, is that associated vessels may be widely scattered among different individuals and institutions. Because these vessels tend to come from burial contexts, decorated pottery may be present in collections in higher proportions than expected for a domestic assemblage. Over-representation of small vessel sizes is also related to the acquisition of grave</page><page sequence="6">228 SMITH goods by many collectors, because burials tend to include small vessels (Lindauer 1988:83-89). In spite of all these caveats, whole vessel collections can still pro- vide a great deal of information for archaeological research. The following information was recorded for each vessel: 1) buff ware type; 2) vessel form; 3) motif(s) present; 4) positive versus negative design; 5) general layout category (sectioned, banded, or all over); 6) museum catalog number; 7) archaeological context; and 8) basic metric measurements where possible (some vessels were recorded from photographs). In addition, a sketch was made of each vessel. In most cases, type and vessel form had already been ascertained for the whole vessels. This study preserved the original classifications, but plates were consid- ered shallow, subhemispherical bowls and thus were included with the bowl counts. Motifs were identified based on previously defined categories (Haury 1976:229- 245). In addition to the whole vessel collections, a sherd-based approach accounted for the presence or absence of specific motifs. With the exception of Haury's type sherd collection from Snaketown, a quantitative analysis was not possible. In the case of the Grewe site, the VB-LAMEA notes contain charts with counts of cer- tain motifs; it is not clear, however, whether these notes refer to sherds only, or sherds, partial vessels, and whole vessels together. Norton Allen collected type sherds apparently only for unusual animal motifs encountered; his collection is quite small, and many motifs present on whole vessels are not found in the sherd sample. RESULTS The quantitative data from this study show an extremely high ratio of birds to other life forms (66%) on all whole pots, excluding effigy vessels. Reptiles appear less frequently (20%), followed by humans (8%) and quadrupeds (5%). Identifi- able birds are water birds, quail, raptors, and flying birds (Figure 2). Reptiles are usually homed toads with stout midsections, but snakes and other indeterminate reptiles are occasionally present (Figure 3). Humans are most often shown danc- ing in banded formations around vessel exteriors, but also sometimes appear play- ing flutes (Figure 4). Anthropomorphized animals, common in Mesoamerica and other areas of the Southwest (e.g., among the Mimbres), do not appear. Four- legged mammals were all classified as quadrupeds. When they have horns, they seem to be deer, antelope, or, rarely, bighorn sheep; when they do not, they may represent dogs or coyotes (see Figure 4). Fish, insects, and the Mexican mythical creature Cipactli each appear once (Table 1). When the presence of bird motifs is considered for each site, percentages are consistently high. Birds represent 62.5 percent of life form images at the Grewe site, 63.9 percent at Snaketown, and 65.4 percent at the Gila Bend sites.

Courtesy University of Arizona Press. consistency indicates a preference for bird images shared by the Hohokam pro- ducers and consumers of pottery for mortuary purposes throughout the Gila Ba- sin. Similarly, the presence of reptile, human, and quadruped motifs among the three study areas conforms to the overall distribution (see Table 1). The distribution of the four most common life form motifs across temporal boundaries also exhibits a high ratio of birds to other animals. Overall, 73 percent of the Colonial period vessels in the sample have bird motifs, as opposed to 15 percent reptiles, 9 percent humans, and 3 percent quadrupeds. Life form images on Sedentary period pots include 55 percent birds, 31 percent reptiles, 7 percent humans, and 7 percent quadrupeds. Tables 2 through 4 present temporal and ves- sel form distributions for individual sites. The Sedentary period sample is smaller than the Colonial period sample, indicating an overall trend through time of a decreasing emphasis on life form motifs. Nonetheless, these data suggest a de- crease in bird iconography and an increase in the preference for reptiles from the Colonial to the Sedentary period. Distributions of life form motifs among the major vessel form classes illumi- nate patterns in motif selection independent from spatial and temporal trends.</page><page sequence="8">230 SMITH Figure 3. Reptile motifs (Haury 1976:Fig.\12.86; 1986:Fig. 11.46d). Courtesy University of Arizona Press. Bird motifs represent the majority of life form motifs on bowls and jars (77 and 74%, respectively). Reptiles, however, appear in a higher percentage relative to birds on scoops (40%, as opposed to 60% for birds), and the highest percentage of all motifs on "other" vessels (80%). These "other" vessel forms with reptile mo- tifs include two tripod plates, five rectangular vessels with primarily exterior painted designs, and one pipe. The rectangular vessels depict reptiles in the negative, in contrast to the positive representations on tripod plates and the pipe. Whereas birds appear to have been preferred on conventional forms such as bowls and jars, this pattern breaks down when more eccentric forms are considered. This appar- ent preference for reptile motifs on less conventional forms may represent a sig- nificant departure from the overall selection for birds. Effigy vessels are considered separately from the main whole vessel data but, like the whole vessel collections, are all from mortuary contexts (Table 5). The Snaketown collection is by far the most diverse, representing a continuum from the Pioneer period through the Sedentary period. The Pioneer period vessels con- sist of two human and two bird effigy jars, as well as two tortoise effigy censers. A single human effigy jar comes from the Colonial period. The most diverse effigy vessels are from in the Sedentary period. Human (n= 1), bird (n=2), and fish (n= 1) effigy jars are present, as well as censers in the form of snakes (n=l), bighorn sheep (n=3), and other unidentified quadrupeds (n = 1).</page><page sequence="9">Zoomorphic Iconography on Hohokam Pottery 231 Figure 4. Quadruped and anthropomorphic motifs (Gladwin et al. 1937:PI. CLVIII I; Haury 1976:Figs. 12.86, 12.87). Courtesy University of Arizona Press. All of the effigy vessels from the Gila Bend area and the Grewe site are from Sedentary period contexts. This trend is in contrast to the appearance of the great- est proliferation of painted life forms on pottery during the Colonial period. The popularity of effigy vessels during the Sedentary period suggests a changing mor- tuary tradition that relates to an apparent decrease in representational art from the Colonial to the Sedentary period (Haury 1976:241). Furthermore, the possible shift in emphasis from painting bird to reptile motifs through time supports this hypothesis. The Allen collection includes two bird effigy vessels, five bighorn sheep censers, and one snake censer; there are eight bighorn sheep censers and one tortoise censer from the Grewe site (see Table 5). Because bighorn sheep rarely appear on painted pottery, their relatively high frequency in the form of effigy censers is a pattern that may be addressed through an examination of vessel function. Even though all of these vessels are from mortuary contexts, censers may have had a different purpose (e.g., burning incense) in burial rites than more conventional forms such as jars and bowls, and the life form images associated with them may reflect their use patterns. The presence or absence of life form motifs on whole vessels and sherds from the three sites or areas is presented in Table 6. Surprisingly, given its smaller sample size, the Grewe site has more diverse motifs co-occurring on the same</page><page sequence="10">Table 1.

More quantifiable data on co-occur- ring motifs, with good provenience information, would allow for better context- based analyses of potentially meaningful patterns in their distribution. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES Painted pottery is only one medium that typically incorporates representa- tional art. Whereas it is interesting to look at the relationship between the variabil- ity of motifs and their contexts, an integrative approach to understanding iconog- raphy must take into account the occurrence or absence of motifs across all media on which they appear (cf. Brody 1991; Crown 1994; Hays-Gilpin 1996). Some media, such as Navajo sandpainting and body painting, are quite ephemeral, but those that are more durable, such as rock art, have the potential to yield a great deal of information for archaeological research. Another line of evidence useful in iconographic studies is ethnographic anal- ogy. Cautionary tales notwithstanding, an examination of contemporary and his- torical ethnographic accounts can be a useful lens through which to examine icono- graphic symbolism (cf. Brody 1977; Crown 1994). Numerous ethnographic ac- counts of Piman and Tohono O'odham peoples have been published since the 1880s (e.g., Bahr 1971; Bahr et al. 1994; Bancroft 1886; Rea 1998; Russell 1908; Underhill 1940, 1941). The following section discusses two different contextual approaches to life form representation-rock art research and ethnographic anal- ogy. Rock Art Rock art is a medium of expression that lends itself well to iconographic studies. In spite of chronological problems and the difficulty of identifying cul- tural association, rock art is a useful tool for analysis because it is plentiful and durable, and has diverse subject matter. Furthermore, rock art research is more suited to the data set considered here than the approaches outlined above. Both types of study are concerned with the presence or absence of particular life form images and their two-dimensional representations. Finally, rock art research and this kind of ceramic design analysis have two main approaches in common. The first method is the collection of contextual data to ascertain the presence of pat- terns; the second is the use of ethnographic analogy to make inferences about symbolism (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:112). Hohokam Rock Art Much rock art throughout central and southern Arizona is associated with the Hohokam culture and has been identified as the Gila petroglyph style (Schaafsma 1980:83). Representational designs are common, and many of the life form im-</page><page sequence="19">Zoomorphic Iconography on Hohokam Pottery 241 ages depicted by petroglyphs also appear on Hohokam pottery. Although Archaic rock art is present at many of the same sites, life form representation is extremely rare in Archaic rock art (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:87). Hohokam representa- tional petroglyphs are appropriate to compare and contrast with red-on-buff pot- tery decoration, because, as in rock art, life form depictions on pottery are typi- cally discrete units of design. Quantitative data for life form motifs in rock art are problematic because of mixed chronological and cultural contexts. A tally of motifs at one rock art site defined as uniquely Hohokam, the Painted Rocks site near Gila Bend, resulted in a total of 21.6 percent anthropomorphs, 14.7 percent reptiles, and 7.5 percent quadrupeds (Martynec 1989:18-19). Conversely, at Quail Point, another rock art site near Gila Bend, an abundance and diversity of bird images are present; Hedges and Hamann (1995:91) attribute this phenomenon to the importance of birds, par- ticularly water birds, to the mythology of Yuman peoples, the present-day descen- dants of the Patayan. Overall, anthropomorphs and four-legged mammals predominate on Hohokam rock art (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:82). Quadrupeds are often difficult to iden- tify as to specific animal; they are variously interpreted as deer, antelope, and bighorn sheep when they have horns, and dogs, coyotes, or "miscellaneous warm- blooded zoomorphs" when they do not (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:65; White 1965:33). Although reptiles-mostly snakes and horned toads-and birds do ap- pear, they are far less common. These frequencies are in contrast to life forms on pottery, where birds are by far the most common motifs and quadrupeds among the least. Possible interpretations of life form images on Hohokam rock art include fertility and hunting scenes. By addressing images within broader archaeological and cultural contexts, however, less simplistic possibilities arise (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:146). Bighorn sheep depictions, for example, are common in rock art but were rarely painted on pottery, being preferred instead for representation on censers, effigy vessels, and bone hairpins, artifacts more often associated with ritual contexts (Haury 1976:206, 303-304). Three discrete sets of charred sheep horns were discovered in a structure at Snaketown interpreted as serving "special purposes" (Haury 1976:62). Sheep horns were also ritually significant to historic Pimans (Castetter and Bell 1942:67-68; Rea 1998:35; Russell 1908:155). In com- bination, these data suggest that bighorn sheep representation in Hohokam rock art is related to an apparent ritual interest expressed in material culture. But rock art, because of its location in open spaces, is more accessible than objects found only in select archaeological contexts interpreted as ritual-based. Therefore, big- horn sheep images in petroglyphs may be the artistic expression of a group of people entirely different from those who gathered in the council houses (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:146). This inference provides an excellent example of apply-</page><page sequence="20">242 SMITH ing the two main methodological approaches enumerated above: the collection of contextual data and the use of ethnographic analogy. Ethnographic Analogy Although the Pima and Tohono O'odham may share biological ties with the prehistoric Hohokam, there is scant evidence for an unbroken prehistoric-historic continuum in the Hohokam area (Bahr et al. 1994:1-11). For example, Pima oral history states that the Pima conquered the Hohokam rather than descended from them (Bahr et al. 1994:1-11; Teague 1993). Furthermore, the influence of Chris- tianity brought by Spanish missionaries beginning in the seventeenth century sig- nificantly influenced Pima as well as other Native American legends (Bahr et al. 1994:16-24). A brief look at the ethnographic literature reveals frequent references to ani- mals. In the cleansing autumn deer dance, for example, Tohono O'odham partici- pants carry a deer tail that represents magical power (Underhill 1940:52). Big- horn sheep are also important in traditional Pima rituals (Castetter and Bell 1942:67; Rea 1998:35). Another ritual practiced historically by the Pima is the rain dance, in which people dance in a circle (Underhill 1940:49). These dances were usually held in July at the saguaro harvest camps. It is easy to imagine the Hohokam beckoning rain in a similar fashion; indeed, bands of human figures holding hands depicted around a vessel's circumference may be interpreted as dancing, but identifying a specific dance is impossible. In Pima folklore, individuals receive power from animals through dreams. Sometimes mammals, but more often birds, are the source of these powers (Rea 1998:32-33). The importance of birds to the Tohono O'odham (Papago) is illus- trated in an account from the excavations at Ventana Cave led by archaeologist Julian Hayden: Ventana Cave is the home of the whirlwind, the dust devil of Papago belief, and is the site of a perennial spring. It also contains more than twelve thousand years of human history. Among the workers excavating the site with Hayden was a Papago named Juan Xavier. A foreman, Xavier coordinated the work and organized much of the digging. A medicine man among his people, he lived below the cave with a couple of other men. During the excavating, Xavier would take leave on occasion to visit one of his daughters, who was dying of tuberculosis. She was being cared for in an Indian hospital near Gila Crossing and was not expected to live. Still, Xavier did not give up hope and was faithful in seeing his daughter whenever he could. On one occasion, Xavier found renewed hope that his daughter might recover. Together with a son, he journeyed to see her and found her somewhat stronger than at any time in the recent past. She looked more radiant, with her</page><page sequence="21">Zoomorphic Iconography on Hohokam Pottery 243 face made up and her hair dressed for her father's visit. Xavier returned to the mine feeling better than he had for some time. At noon the following day, the mine workers looked up and saw that a bird had flown down into the dark recesses of the cave. The bird, a Silver King pigeon, alighted among the men. It appeared unusually tame, and they assumed it was a messenger pigeon that had arrived with a message. But no message was attached to the bird's feet. All that afternoon and throughout the next morning the pigeon remained among the men, flitting from one perch to another. They tried to catch the bird, but it remained just out of reach, always within a few feet of someone, but never close enough to touch. Just after noon that day, a messenger came to the cave and asked for Juan Xavier. Hayden took the message, as Xavier was in the mine working. The news was that Xavier's daughter had died the previous day, just before noon. It seemed to Hayden that Xavier was waiting for him when he called him aside and reported the news of his daughter's death. Xavier showed no emotion whatsoever, but called to his son. The two of them then departed. A few noticed that the Silver King pigeon was no longer among the men. No sign was left behind, not even a feather. After work was finished that evening, Hayden drove back to his headquarters in Santa Rosa with Antonio, Juan's older cousin. Hayden expressed concern to Antonio that Xavier had not seemed the least bit surprised or distressed to learn that his daughter had passed away-especially since he had been in such good spirits the previous day when he and his son returned from the hospital. "No, Juan was not surprised," Antonio said. He was solemn. "For you see, the pigeon was his daughter. She had come to the cave to say good-bye to her father" (Murray 1988). Another curious story, this one of mythological origins, involves a lizard and a bird, specifically a parrot: Morning Green Chief, the ruler of the great-house that Americans call Casa Grande, has a daughter close to whom a lizard falls to earth, apparently from the sky. The fallen lizard becomes turquoise whose mass greatly exceeds the mass of the lizard. These stones are taken up as decorations and adornments by the great-house community. The chief at a neighboring place..., named Sun Meeter, desires some of the turquoise, so he creates a parrot and sends it to Morning Green's place to swallow as many stones as possible. The parrot returns home filled with turquoise... (Bahr et al. 1994:138-139). These stories illustrate the real and mythological importance of animals to historic populations who inherited their environment, if not their genetic makeup, from their predecessors, the Hohokam. Although direct correlations between mytho- logical characters and figures depicted on prehistoric pottery and other media are impossible, an intensive mythology study focusing on issues of symbolism and iconography may contribute to a better understanding of Hohokam culture in gen- eral.</page><page sequence="22">244 SMITH DISCUSSION The similarity in motif distributions among the three study areas suggests a shared ideology. Based on informal macroscopic examination, the majority of the whole vessels in the Gila Bend collection have technological attributes, such as micaceous schist temper and a porous, buff-colored paste, similar to buff ware pottery manufactured at middle Gila River basin sites like Snaketown and the Grewe site. This lack of evidence for the selection of particular motifs from the potters' repertoire suggests that the Gila Bend Hohokam had preferences similar to those of their upstream neighbors. It is plausible that the cultural identity ex- pressed through iconography on ceramic vessels was accepted, or even embraced, by different groups of people within the Hohokam region. Although social bound- aries likely existed between such different groups throughout the Gila basin, this aspect of their material culture suggests some form of integration. The presence of life form motifs on burial goods also suggests some social meaning. It would be useful to examine the ratio of burial pots with life form iconography versus those without, and to look for redundancy of specific motifs on pottery and other media within individual burials and cremation areas. One cremation at Snaketown, for example, contained three whole vessels with the fly- ing bird motif; if patterns exist within and between cremation areas, such a study may illuminate them. A use wear study on whole vessels would also shed light on whether vessels with animal iconography were selected especially for inclusion in burials because of their original use contexts. Haury's (1976:229-245) comprehensive sherd-based analysis of life figures on pottery at Snaketown defined the categories of ceramic animal iconography and traced their frequencies through time. A total of 1,347 sherds yielded, in de- scending order of frequency, birds, reptiles, humans, quadrupeds, fish, and in- sects. The sherds, all from trash and household contexts, did not appear to reflect any meaningful patterns of spatial distribution (Haury 1976:242). Perhaps a com- parative study, based on sherds and whole pots, between such everyday contexts and burials would elucidate patterns not reflected in sherd distributions among everyday contexts alone or among only burial contexts. Unfortunately, data on life form representation are rarely collected. For ex- ample, the present study relies more heavily on data collected first-hand from the actual artifacts than on any published information, precisely because these data are not presented in most publications. Many of the large-scale excavations con- ducted in recent years throughout the Salt-Gila basin, such as at the Grewe site (Abbott n.d.), would be ideal sources for investigating animal iconography. Fu- ture research should include more detailed information about the presence, fre- quency, and distribution of life form images on buff ware pottery. The collection</page><page sequence="23">Zoomorphic Iconography on Hohokam Pottery 245 of simple, quantified data will enable researchers to ask questions about patterns of life form representation in the archaeological record that are answerable. The implications of zoomorphic iconography on Hohokam pottery for ce- ramic analysis are extensive. Unfortunately, the study of life forms has been too often overlooked in recent years. Hohokam archaeologists have developed very sophisticated methods of technological analysis that, combined with consider- ations of design and vessel morphology, including attention to painted depictions of life forms, have the potential to yield a wealth of information about prehistoric Hohokam culture.
