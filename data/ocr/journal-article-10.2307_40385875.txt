<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modern and Contemporary Periods Marc B. Shapiro, The Limits of Orthodox Theology. Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised. London: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. 221 pp. Index. One could expect science to loom large in this book, whose purpose is to describe how post-Maimonidean generations related to Maimonides' Thirteen Principles. Now according to Maimonides, the first commandment incumbent on a Jew is to know that there is a First Existent on whom all other existents depend (Hilkot yesodei ha-Torab 1.1). To acquire that knowledge is not a trifling matter, but presupposes a long learning process, commencing with logic and leading up to metaphysics, passing by way of mathematics and physics. Similarly, as Maimonides often insists, understanding God's incorporeality (among other topics) requires long study. Hence, a study of the history of the reception of Maimonides' Thirteen Principles could be expected to include the varying attitudes toward the scientific-philosophical underpinning of those principles, without which they are devoid of contents. This expectation is not fulfilled, however. Instead, Shapiro takes one principle after the other and surveys the statements bearing on it by different rabbinic authorities of 345</page><page sequence="2">subsequent periods; these statements are not placed in historical context and remain purely verbal constructs, without definite content. To give but one example: Shapiro provides a fairly long list of authors, both pre- and post-Maimonidean, who more or less explicitly affirmed anthropomorphism. Now affirming the corporeal character of the deity does not presuppose particularly sophisticated philosophical notions. By contrast, the statement that God is incorporeal cannot be given substance without an adequate philosophical underpinning; or, rather, the statement that God is incorporeal has different meanings according to the author's philosophical stance. An overview of the pronouncements by which various thinkers assented to this principle is therefore not very informative if we do not know what ideas each of them associated with their acceptance of this principle. Shapiro's book is not really interested in the history of thought. Its purpose is contemporary-to disprove the widespread view that Maimonides' Principles are and have always been binding and encapsulate the theology of Orthodox Judaism. For this purpose there is no need for context. Like all works of the classic Jewish tradition, Shapiro's book is deliberately a-historical: statements made centuries apart can be compared and discussed in the same breath, because they are supposed to have an immutable and historically invariable kernel of meaning. Historians may still find the book useful as a catalogue and handbook of authors who expressed an opinion about the Principles, although they will have to provide their own interpretations of these opinions.</page></plain_text>
