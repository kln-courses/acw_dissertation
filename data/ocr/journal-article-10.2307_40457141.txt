<plain_text><page sequence="1">V-Shaped Chest -Markings Re-Considered: a Palaeolithic Figurine as Explanation of Their Wide Modern Distribution By Carl Schuster In my article entitled "V-Shaped Chest-Markings: Distribution of a Design-Motive in and around the Pacific" (Anthropos 47. 1952, pp. 99-118), I illustrated a number of such markings from Southeast Asia, the islands of the Pacific, and North and South America. At the end of that article I also mentioned the sporadic occurrence of such markings in Negro Afri- ca. From this study it appeared that, despite variations, there is one type of marking which occurs repeatedly in almost every region: this is a "V" com- posed of two or more parallel rows of dots. The widespread occurrence of this "double-dotted V" among "primitive" peoples throughout much of the modern world seems to invite the inference that the type must have originated very long ago. Now evidence of its prehistoric origin has indeed come to light. Six years after the appearance of the above-mentioned article in Anthropos, Efimenko published a report on his excavations at the upper palaeolithic site of Kostiënki-I on the Don River in South Russia, in which were found a number of female figurines of mammoth ivory, including that here reproduced as figure 1, showing exactly the same kind of double-dotted V-shaped chest-marking as occurs so widely among modern "primitives" - a sampling of which is provided for comparison in figures 2-9. It therefore now seems appropriate to re-consider, at least briefly, the problem of the "V-shaped chest-markings" in view of this prehistoric evidence, in order to determine to what extent and in what way archaeology and ethnology may here shed light upon each other. The V-shaped marking on the chest of this figurine is formed of two rough- ly parallel rows of superficial nicks running from the shoulders to a point be- tween the breasts. The marks appear to have been made by successive jabs of a sharp instrument, resulting in a series of tiny chevrons rather than of "dots" or "spots", as they generally appear in the chest-markings of modern "prim- itives". But the similarity of concept and arrangement is nevertheless striking,</page><page sequence="2">V-Shaped Chest-Markings Re-Considered 429 and the inference of a basic relationship between the palaeolithic and the modern markings seems, to me at least, inescapable. Can we find in this palaeolithic figurine some clue to the original purpose or meaning of the similar modern markings ? In his report of 1958 Efimenko merely described the design on the chest, without attempting to explain it. Subsequently, in an article published in 1960, Abramova illustrated new de- tails of the same figurine (here reproduced as fig. la), showing what appears to be a continuation of the V-shaped chest-marking around the neck of the figure and on to its back, where it seems that two, or possibly three, rows of similar little marks once formed a group of parallel U-shaped curves, corresponding roughly to the double "V" on the chest. From this configuration of the rows of marks on the chest and back, Abramova concludes that what is represented is "in all pro- bability a necklace" *. Abramova's explanation does indeed seem plausible and, at first sight, entirely acceptable. Nevertheless, upon reflection I cannot avoid a certain doubt. In the first place, the fact that the "necklace" is double, and that it corresponds in this respect to many of the V-shaped markings as they are tattooed, scarified or painted on the chests of modern "primitives", makes me wonder whether the double row of markings on the palaeolithic figurine might not stand for the tattooed representation of a pair of necklaces, rather than the actual necklaces themselves. The fact that other elements of bodily decoration, such as fillets and girdles, are generally rendered on palaeolithic figurines from Kostiënki and elsewhere in relief, rather than by superficial scratches, suggests to me that if actual necklaces had been intended, the beads composing them might have been indicated in a more naturalistic manner. Might not the shal- low jab-marks on the Kostiënki figurine have been intended to convey the impression of a jabbing of the skin with the point of a sharp instrument, as in tattooing or scarification ? This of course would not prejudice the thesis that the design was originally and ultimately inspired by an actual necklace, as Abramova proposes - a type of necklace which was presumably familiar to the palaeolithic carver. The fact that the double lines of dots forming the "V" on the chests of living peoples almost invariably end at the shoulders or continue down the arms, rather than the back, suggests to me that among such peoples these markings were no longer associated with the idea of a necklace, even though, as we infer from the Kostiënki figurine, this must have been the ulti- mate source of inspiration of the type. According to this interpretation of the Kostiënki design, the tradition of tattooing a double "V" on the chest was already established in palaeolithic times. If this is so (and I admit that I see no way of actually proving it), we must ask why it would have occurred to anybody to tattoo a necklace in the first place. Could it be that actual necklaces were, in those remote times, composed of rare or exotic shells, or of beads difficult to manufacture, and that necklaces 1 Abramova, 1960, p. 133. From Abramova's drawings, as here reproduced, and also from the drawings in Efimenko's publication of 1958, only one of which is repro- duced in our figure 1, it appears that besides the double "necklace" on the chest and back, this figure wore a third strand of beads as a "choker" tightly around the neck (cf. our figures 12, 17, 18 and 19).</page><page sequence="3">430 Carl Schuster Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 were, for this reason, important "status symbols", which it would have been desirable to attach to oneself, as it were, by permanent incorporation under the skin? Could the duplication of the "necklace", which we see for the first time on the Kostiënki figurine, and which continues into modern usage, have represented originally an enhancement of status ? The fact that in modern usage such markings are often applied to men as well as to women suggests that they have lost any special significance they may have had originally, and have be- come merely traditional decorations 2. If the tradition of making such markings was indeed continuous from pa- laeolithic to modern times, it would be natural to inquire whether there is any evidence of similar markings in intervening epochs. Indications of this sort seem to be rare ; but it may be worth presenting here at least the few bits of evidence now known to me, in order to call attention to the problem and perhaps elicit fur- ther examples which may be known to others, or which may come to light through future archaeological activity. As shown in figure 10, a marking of this type appears on the representation of a male figure from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (around 2000 B. C). The "geometric" appearance of this marking suggests a long-established convention ; and the fact that the figure is male seems to rule out any reminiscence of a "necklace". The circumstance that a closely similar design is scarified on the chest of a modern Negro from Malawi (fig. 11) may, I think, be regarded as evidence that this scheme of bodily decoration has per- sisted in Africa for at least four thousand years. In Eastern Asia a fragmentary figurine of the late neolithic period from North China (1500-1400 B. C), shows what appears to be a chest-marking of this type (fig. 12), in the form of three curved rows of pit-marks running from the abdomen to each shoulder (thus again hardly a necklace) - with an additional double row of similar marks around the neck possibly representing a true necklace, complete with pendant 3. Perhaps we may regard this prehistoric Chinese marking as antecedent, if not actually ancestral, to similar markings applied to their bodies by various living peoples of Southeast Asia and the Pacific - since these regions were for long periods evidently under strong cultural influences from the Asiatic mainland 4. 2 Only rarely in modern times does the V-shaped chest-marking seem to have been conceived as representing an actual necklace. Such an exception may be seen in the body- painting of a Caduveo woman from Brazil (fig. 19), in which a painted "pendant" (apparent- ly anthropomorphic) is "suspended" from the point of a somewhat flattened "V". (Com- pare Schuster, 1952, fig. 31, showing a "bird" pendant similarly arranged in a tattooing from Easter Island; and compare note 15 below.) In archaeological specimens it is not always possible to decide whether we are dealing with actual necklaces or with body- markings representing them. In figure 8, for example, it is fairly obvious that the inten- tion was to represent a marking of the skin ; but in the following illustration the configura- tion of the lines suggests rather a necklace. This is, of course, the same dilemma with which we are confronted in the palaeolithic effigies of figures 1 and 13. 3 Cf. note 1. 4 See Heine-Geldern, 1937, and many subsequent publications by the same au- thor; also various contributions to a Symposium entitled Early Chinese Art and Its Possible Influence in the Pacific Basin, held at Columbia University, New York, in 1967, the Proceedings of which are now being edited for publication.</page><page sequence="4">V-Shaped Chest-Markings Re-Considered 431 Though the only "V-shaped" chest-marking of palaeolithic times known to me is that illustrated in figure 1, it may be appropriate to mention here another figurine of that epoch which carries a marking of a possibly related type. In figure 13 is shown a female effigy from the famous Siberian palaeolithic site of MaFta, which has a series of curiously formed double indentations running from the right shoulder diagonally across the right chest. The fact that a similar marking appears on the back of the woman's coiffure led the excavator, Gerasi- mov, to see the design on the chest as a plait of hair ; while Abramova would see in it rather "an incomplete baldric or necklace" 5. Both explanations are, in fact, perfectly plausible ; but I think that there is some reason for envisaging a third explanation: namely, that this marking of the chest, despite its con- formity to the marking on the back of the head, might represent a scarifi- cation or tattooing, equivalent to one half of the design on the chest of the Kostiënki effigy (fig. 1). Again it is mainly modern usages which prompt me to suggest such an interpretation. For among the same modern "primitives" who mark a bilateral "V" upon the chest, we sometimes encounter a unilateral decoration, obviously half of a "V", in the form of a diagonal marking of only one breast. A selection of such modern markings is reproduced in figures 14-16. The relation of these unilateral markings to the bilateral "V" in the same or neighboring cultures is clear enough ; though the reason for limiting the design to one breast is not so clear. Perhaps it was that after half of the contemplated " V" was done, the wear- er did not wish to face the pain of having it completed ; or it might have been because the operator was no longer available, or for any number of personal reasons - or even because the unilateral design was felt to be interesting or distinctive in itself. Whatever the reason may be, since such unilateral markings do occur fairly widely among the same modern "primitives" who inscribe the full "V" on their chests, I venture to infer that the unilateral marking on the chest of the Mal'ta figurine might similarly represent one half of a tattooed or scarified "V" as it occurs in full form on the chest of the Kostiënki woman of figure 1. Of possible interest in connection with this problem are certain small figurines of faience representing Nubian "dancing girls", which were sometimes placed in Egyptian graves of the Middle Kingdom - thus at about the same time as that of the Egyptian male scarification of figure 10. Two of these "dancing girls", here reproduced as figures 17 and 18, show diagonal markings in the form of a row of dots across the chest. It is quite possible that these markings represent in each case a kind of beaded baldric, as envisaged by Abramova for the marking on the chest of the Marta effigy (fig. 13). On the other hand, it seems to me not impossible that they are meant to indicate the tattooed representations of such baldrics or necklaces, and are thus equivalent to half of the male tattooing of figure 10. 5 Gerasimov, 1958, p. 39; Abramova, 1960, p. 133, and 1962, p. 46 (her figurine no. 23).</page><page sequence="5">432 Carl Schuster Anthropos 63/64. 1968/69 For those who may be interested in this matter, I cite the following considerations. Most figurines of this type (though not the two here illustrated) show, on various parts of the body, clusters of little lozenges, each composed of 16 dots: precisely such dotted lozenges have been found tattooed on the skin of mummies from the same period as these effigies 6. There can be no doubt, thus, that such effigies of "dancing girls" were decorated to represent, at least in part, tattooing. But it is not always clear how much of the painted decoration represents tattooing and how much represents something else. Thus precisely such dots as were grouped to represent the tattooed lozenges were also grouped to represent the hair of the pubic triangle on the same figurines. Bracelets and armlets, as shown in figure 17, may be real or tattooed 7. And while it is true that the girdles painted around the waists of such figurines have their counterparts in actual girdles composed of beads and cowrie shells which have been recovered archaeologically 8, I confess to some hesi- tation in regarding the "baldrics" painted across the chests of figures 17 and 18 as neces- sarily representing actual strings of beads; and, as suggested above, I wonder whether these "baldrics" might not have been tattooed. Let us consider the matter a little more closely. In the first place, it should be said that diagonal rows of dots extending from one shoulder to the opposite hip, as we see them in figures 17 and 18, are exceptional among such figurines: most of them have single or double "necklaces" of such dots falling from both shoulders and either forming a "U" in front or crossing each other on the abdomen and continuing (either singly or doubly) to cross again in the middle of the back, and thence rise to the shoulders. Such markings do look plausible like representations of actual necklaces; and it may be that that is what they do represent. But if the intention were to represent necklaces by means of tattooing, the tattooed "beads" would, of course, fall in exactly the same places as the real ones! Indeed, Breasted, for one, seems to have regarded such rows of painted dots as represent- ing tattooing rather than necklaces 9. If what we see in these figurines are tattooed representations of necklaces rather than real ones, then, needless to say, the best evidence for this interpretation of the designs would be the existence of similar designs tattooed on the skin of mummies surviving from the same epoch as the figurines. While most of the tattooing preserved to us on such mummies is from the lower parts of the body or the limbs (and mainly in the form of the above-mentioned dotted lozenges), there does exist at least one Middle Kingdom mummy which preserves some of the tattooing of the chest - and this has the form of a line of dots, evidently running diagonally across it - though it is true that these dots are enclosed between two parallel lines, and it is difficult to say, from the published illustrations, whether their direction corresponds to that of the "baldrics" of our illustrations 10. If this tattooing does not represent beads, it might possibly represent one of the shoulder-straps supporting the nether garments apparently worn by (if not indeed merely tattooed upon) some of the "dancing" girls n. Until and unless we have better documentation from mum- mies of the period represented by these figurines, the question whether the "baldrics" of 6 Keimer, 1948, pls. vi-ix; Winlock, 1923, fig. 20. 7 Cf. Keimer, p. 24, with reference to his pl. xiv, 2. 8 Keimer, fig. 13 and pp. 19 fï.; cf. Winlock, 1920. 9 Thus Breasted, 1948, p. 95, note 16, describes a figurine of this type (Berlin Museum, 9583, his pl. 90, b) as "tattooed with numerous lozenges and dots arranged in lines". The latter expression can only refer to her "necklaces", which consist (as in many such figurines) of two diagonal strands or baldrics crossing each other on the abdomen and the back. 10 See Keimer, plates n and in, also fig. 6 and text, p. 10. The mummy is that of an Xlth-dynasty priestess of Hathor, named Amounet, found at Deir el-Bahri. 11 See, for example, Keimer, pl. xin, figs. 1, 3 and 4, and pl. xiv, fig. 2. Similar "shoulder-straps" appear in the painted decoration of contemporary wooden "paddle dolls", e.g. Keimer, pl. xv; though here again it is not always easy to distinguish between "shoulder-straps" and crossing strands of beads (or their tattooed representation).</page><page sequence="6">V-Shaped Chest-Markings Re-Considered 433 figures 17 and 18 are real or tattooed must, no doubt, be left open; but in the meantime it seems to me worth calling attention to at least the possibility that they are tattooed, and that, if so, they would have a certain correspondence on the one hand to the modern "primitive" scarifications of figures 14-16, and on the other hand to the unilateral mark- ing on the chest of the palaeolithic pendant from Marta (fig. 13). In this connection it is interesting to observe that all such "dancing girl" figurines from Middle Kingdom burials, though they were formed, to speak, with loving naturalism - no doubt in order to render them agreeable companions for the souls of their deceased masters - are nevertheless deliberately made without feet. Egyptologists seem to agree among themselves that the reason for depriving the girls of feet was to prevent them from running away 12. This might have been the conscious intention; but I cannot help noticing an analogy between the footlessness of these figurines and that of so many representations of the female figure in palaeolithic art, including the pendant of our figure 13. Might not the apody of the "dancing girls" (like the notable steatopygy of certain Nubian figurines of the same epoch) 13 reflect the survival in Egypt, or perhaps more specifically in Nubia, of a palaeolithic tradition 14 ? If so, the footlessness of the Egyptian figurines tends to confirm my impression that the marking of their bodies may also go back to a much earlier, specifically palaeolithic, tradition. By way of summary, I propose that the V-shaped chest-markings of modern "primitive" peoples are probably derived ultimately from the repre- sentation of a necklace, perhaps originally double or multiple, as we see it for the first time on the palaeolithic image of figure 1 ; but that this deriva- tion was already forgotten at an early stage in the transmission of the design. For, as indicated above, I suspect (mainly because of the wide distribution of tattooed and painted designs of this type among modern "primitives") that the "necklaces" of the Kostiënki figurine were already tattooed. This is, of course, different from the explanation of the V-shaped markings which I proposed in my article of 1952, before I could know about the palaeolithic figurines which were published later. In my earlier article I said nothing about necklaces, but suggested, rather, that the modern V-shaped markings might be derived from the figure of a bird with outstretched wings - since a number of the markings which I illustrated at that time are obviously ornithomor- phic 15. 12 E. g. Keimer, p. 19, note 4 (citing Boreux). 13 See Firth, 1912, pl. 39, a and b, illustrating figurines of the so-called "Nubian C-Group", dating from between the Middle and New Kingdoms. Some of these are repro- duced by drawings in Keimer, figs. 32-37; and Keimer, p. 36, note 1, cites further literature. 14 By way of a geographical and chronological "transition" between the footless palaeolithic pendant of Mal'ta (fig. 13), and the footless Egyptian effigies of figures 17 and 18, mention might be made of a figurine-pendant from Bulgaria dating from about 3000 B. C: Detev, 1960, fig. 37 k, and Schuster, 1968, fig. 9. As in the Mal'ta figurine, the legs here converge in a footless point, which is perforated for inverted suspension. The sex is emphasized; and though this object dates from eneolithic times, it is obviously reminiscent of a palaeolithic tradition. 15 It is even possible to add here some further examples of ornithomorphic chest- marking. An unmistakable bird, the tips of its outspread wings coinciding with the nipples of the man on whose chest it is painted, appears on page 23 of Rodrigues Ferreira: the subject is an Indian (probably Camaiurá) of the upper Xingu River in Brazil. Again, in</page><page sequence="7">434 Carl Schuster Anthropos 63 64. 1968/69 Now the question arises whether the avian interpretation proposed in 1952 is to be discarded in favor of that of a "necklace" proposed here. It seems to me rather that the two explanations may, in a sense, be reconciled. For a review of the illustrations in my article of 1952 will show that recognizable "bird" designs sometimes occur side by side with designs of the "beaded" or "necklace" type in the same or neighboring areas; and in at least one instance the bird's wings are even outlined with dots (1952, fig. 23). From these circum- stances, I would now be inclined to conclude that while the basic design is probably of the "beaded" type (derived ultimately from the prehistoric status- symbol of a multiple necklace), nevertheless, as the memory of this derivation was lost, various peoples somehow converted the characteristic outline of the V into a "bird", probably in each instance the representation of a particular kind of bird important in local mythology or folkore, with which the wearer of the design indentified himself. Evidently, however, these transformations, which appeared independently of each other in time and space, never com- pletely superseded or displaced the ancient prototypic motif of a necklace. la Fig. la. - Details of the palaeolithic figurine from Kostiënki-I (fig. 1). After Abramova, 1960 fig. 1,5, who proposes that the design here in question most probably represents a necklace, since it evidently continues over the shoulders and around the back. The lines passing horizontally across the small of the back in this drawing represent, in low relief, what was probably a sort of plaited girdle. (Cf. Abramova, 1960, p. 133; also 1962, p. 10; and Efimenko, 1958, p. 349.) a quite different tradition is the tattooed representation of a Hindu-Buddhist "garuda" on the chest of a man from Laos in Southeast Asia: Nguyên-Xuân-Nguyên, 1941, pl. in, fig. 24. This mythical bird with outstretched wings appears as if it were a pendant "hanging" from a tattooed "necklace" (cf. fig. 19 and note 2). The very disparity, in terms of culture and geography, between these two examples may serve to emphasize our thesis that such "bird" markings are mutually independent local elaborations, as it were ornithomorphizations, of a basic common theme.</page><page sequence="8">V-Shaped Chest-Markings Re-Considered 435 1 2 3 Fig. 1. - Figurine of mammoth ivory (height, 15 cm) from excavations conducted in 1931 at the upper palaeolithic campsite of Kostiënki-I on the Don River, South Russia, and published (for the first time?) by Efimenko in 1958, fig. 141.
