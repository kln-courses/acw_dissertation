Andrzejak GM Research Laboratories Biomedical Science Dept. Warren, Ml ABSTRACT The introduction of energy absorbing steering systems has provided a substantial reduction of occupant injury in car crashes. However, the steering system remains the most important source of occupant injury. Injury associated with steering assembly contact is due to high exposure; energy absorbing steer- ing systems reduce the risk of injury for drivers when compared to the injury risk of right front passengers. Our investigation addressed loading of the upper abdominal region by the steering wheel rim using a physiological model for study of soft tissue injury. Injury to the liver was related to the abdominal compression response associated with rim loading. Although liver injury correlated somewhat with peak abdominal com- pression, a better correlation was found when the rate of compression was also considered. Force limiting by the steering wheel, not by column compression, most strongly influenced the outcome of abdominal injury. The force generated by wheel-rim compression of the abdomen was insufficient to cause either column compression or significant whole-body motions. Subjects loaded by "stiff" steering wheels (having rim deformation forces greater than the abdominal compression force) exhib- ited greater abdominal compression, rate of compression and resulting extent of injury than did subjects loaded by "softer" wheels which deformed more and thus reduced abdomi- nal compression. ENERGY ABSORBING STEERING SYSTEMS introduced in 1967 were designed with a compressible element as a primary feature for occupant protection. The systems also controlled the amount of steering assembly rearward dis- placement in the occupant compartment in a frontal collision. Analysis of crash data by NHTSA (1)* has concluded that the energy absorbing steering system reduced the annual fatalities in frontal impacts by 1 2% and the critical to fatal injuries associated with steering system contact by 38% . Despite the reductions, the steering system remains the most frequent source of injury to car occu- pants. NHTSA (2,3) attributes more than 25% of the total automobile occupant "Harm" to steering system contact, Fig. 1. 0 Steering 25.3% 26.9% Contact NASS NCSS Assembly (3) (2) Contact 26.9% NCSS (2) 25.3% NASS (3) CAR OCCUPANT "HARM" Fig. 1 Percent of car occupant "Harm" associated with steering assembly contact (2,3). The presence of the steering system does not increase and may even reduce the injury risk for drivers (4) when compared to the injury risk of right front passengers. The relatively high incidence of injury associ- ated with steering assembly contact is due to high exposure. Most car occupants are drivers - many times the only occupant. Due to the driver's proximity with the steering assembly, the driver is more likely to inter- act with the steering assembly than other vehicle components - particularly in frontal crashes - and there is a greater risk of * Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. 6.210 0096-736X/86/9406-021 0$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">851724 inJury since frontal crashes tend to be more severe than the general spectrum of crashes. Driver interaction with the steering system has been the subject of many investi- gations which have substantially improved our understanding of driver protection by the steering system (1,5-11). With a compressi- ble column system, the column plays the major role in force limitation and energy absorp- tion when the driver is aligned with the steering assembly. The steering wheel also plays a major role since it is the component contacted by the occupant, and it determines the force distribution on the occupant. The steering wheel provides additional force limiting and energy absorption by deforma- tion, particularly in situations where the driver is off-set or off-axis (6). Thus relative deformation of the wheel and com- pression of the column are highly dependent on the impact alignment of the occupant with the steering assembly (5,6). Crash data indicate that both column compression and steering wheel deformation are important occupant protection aspects (6). Efforts to further improve built-in occupant protection by the steering system must consider both the range of crash situations in which occupants are exposed and injured, and the response and tolerance of the various body regions con- tacting the steering assembly. Injury ("Harm") related to steering assembly contact has been identified by body region (2,3), Fig. 2. The thorax has the highest portion of "Harm", followed by the abdomen (24% to 35%), and the head, which primarily involves facial injury. Injury is somewhat uniformly distributed across the range of impact severities as measured by the vehicle change of velocity (AV), from below 20 mph to at least 40 mph, (2,3), Fig. 3. Although the "Harm" per exposed occupant is greater at high AVs, the exposure frequency is greatest at lower AVs (3), resulting in nearly equivalent injury "Harm" over a large AV exposure range, Fig. 4. This suggests that high, moderate and low severity crashes 100 1 THORAX THORAX 80- E 60- : ///////z i 'T777777'^///)/, *0' 2o- face 'ý/y/yfr, HEAD OTHER OTHER 0J , , NASS NCSS Fig. 2 Distribution of "Harm" associated with steering assembly contact by body region (2,3). ^ 1Q0 -i * &lt; CUMULATIVE ?

In the laboratory, the response of the steering assembly depends on construction and impact stiffness of the test dummy used for the evaluation (7). Additionally, trends associated with changes in steering assembly characteristics are strongly dependent on which dummy and response is used for the evaluation (7). The Hybrid III dummy was judged to be the best of the current mechani- cal surrogates to study the steering system in the laboratory based on its more human- like construction and frontal impact response, and its expanded instrumentation capacity - chest compression being an important response for study of an unre- strained driver interacting with the steering assembly ( 7 ) . 6.211</page><page sequence="3">In spite of gains in understanding of driver protection and in laboratory evalua- tion tools such as the Hybrid III dummy, abdominal injury associated with steering contact is less well understood than thoracic trauma because current anthropomorphic dummies are not instrumented to assess injury potential for frontal abdominal loading. The steering column is elevated from the horizon- tal and its elevation may increase during vehicle deformation in a crash. The lower rim of the wheel can contact the driver first, depending on occupant kinematics. The liver is only partially protected by the rib cage and is a potential loading site for the lower rim. We used an anesthetized animal to study the mechanics of upper abdominal injury from steering wheel rim contact in sled tests. 50-Kg swine,* were chosen for these experi- ments based on the need for a physiological model for soft tissue injury and human-like approximation of the torso and organ mass, and midtorso dimensions of the 50th percen- tile male. However, because of differences in the head, shoulder and pelvic regions, the swine may not be a representative human sur- rogate for other studies of the steering system. The swine has been successfully used as a physiological model for the study of injury mechanisms for vital organs in the torso in previous impact studies (12-16). We investigated force, acceleration and compression response parameters in this study. The compression parameter included a "viscous" response defined as the time vary- ing product of amplitude of the percent compression [ C( t ) ] and the velocity of com- pression [V(t)j. The maximum value of the "viscous" response [V(t)*C( t) ]max was previ- ously shown to correlate with soft tissue injury for frontal thoracic (17-19), lateral abdominal (20), and frontal abdominal (21) impact, where it biomechanically correlated with liver injury (19,21). * The rationale and experimental protocol for the use of an animal model in this program have been reviewed by the Research Laboratories1 Animal Research Committee. The research follows proce- dures outlined in publications by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 'Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,' or the U.S. DHEW National Institute of Health (NIH), 'Guidelines for the Use of Experimental Animals,' and complies with U.S. Depart- ment of Agriculture (USDA) regulations as specified in the Laboratory Animals Wel- fare Act (PL 89-544), as amended in 1970 and 1976 (PL 91-579 and PL 94-279). METHODOLOGY The test fixture consisted of a steel frame mounted on the Hyge sled carriage (Fig. 5). The fully anesthetized subject was supported by a suspension suit attached to a trolley at four corners. The position was adjusted to result in the lower rim loading directly in line with the liver (5 cm below the xyphoid). The trolley system consisted of four wheels suspended on two parallel rails. Slots were machined in the rails for the trolley to drop prior to subject contact with the wheel. During the impact, the sur- rogate was unrestrained by the tethers. To retain the subject on the sled fixture, the trolley had secondary restraints which came into play following the impact. Kinematics of the lower torso were controlled by belt restraints around each leg and anchored to a force limiter with a yield force of 2 kN. The belts did not interfere with abdominal loading by the wheel. A sled velocity of 32 km/h was used for all the tests. The sled acceleration pulse and separation between the lower rim and the abdomen allowed the sled to reach test velocity before significant interaction of the subject with the wheel.

Column angle was 20° or 30° compared to the horizontal. The column was mounted on a bracket which was rigidly attached to the sled fixture by a triaxial force transducer. Instrumentation of the steering assembly consisted of a tri- axial force transducer located between the wheel and the column and a displacement transducer for column compression. Several steering wheels were used in this study. A simulated wheel, Fig. 6a, and two experimental versions of a two-spoke wheel, Fig. 6b, provided several levels of wheel deformation stiffness for rim loading, Fig. 7. The simulated wheel provided a relatively rigid deformation characteristic. A "stiff" version and a "soft" version of the two-spoke wheel provided two deformation stiffnesses without changing other character- istics of the wheel. Additional variations of steering assembly characteristics were studied by alternating between wheel spoke across and vertical positions for tests with the modified two-spoke wheel. Table 1 pro- vides the test matrix for this study. ANIMAL PREPARATION FOR THE SLED TEST - Seventeen swine weighing 49.5 ± 2.0 Kg, were restrained without excitement by an injection of ketamine (20 mg/Kg, IM) and acepromazine (200 yg, IM) followed by atropine (0.08 mg/Kg, IM). The swine were then induced to a surgical plane of anesthesia with a mixture of fentanyl (40 yg/Kg, IM) and droperidol (2 mg/Kg, IM) and maintained on an equal mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide with 1-1 .5% halothane. They breathed spon- taneously in a dorsal recumbency. A tracheotomy was performed on all subjects, a tube inserted through the tracheal incision, and the mixture of inhala- tion gases and oxygen was reconnected to the endotracheal tube. The location of the mid- sternum was determined anatomically (as mid- point between the manubrium and the xyphoid). The midsternum was exposed by cauterizing the skin and the subcutaneous layers. A uniaxial accelerometer was attached to the sternum using bone screws. Catheter tip pressure transducers were inserted into the right femoral artery and vein and guided to the level of upper abdominal viscera. ECG leads (II) were permanently sutured to the limbs for monitor during the test. The swine was then rotated 180° to rest in a ventral recum- bency. The thoracic spinous process trans- verse to the midsternum (T3 and T4) and that transverse to a location 5 cm below the tip of the xyphoid (T11 or T12) were exposed by cauterizing the skin and the subcutaneous layers. Two spinous clamps with mounted accelerometers and photographic targets were fastened to the exposed processes. Particular adaptational aids were necessary for the quadruped to assure basal Fig. 6 Steering wheels used in the sled experiments, (a) Simulated wheel, (b) Two-spoke wheel. * I "Rigid" Simulated ^ / Wheel ^ I Compressive Force Ö 3 / On Spok. -, A ' I ce / A J la.

Before the suspension, an increase in blood volume was induced by intravenous infusion of 250 mL of isotonic lactated Ringer's solution to miti- gate orthostatic hypotension (transient pool- ing of blood due to change in position). The animal was supported in a suspension suit with belts originating from four tethering points for attachment to the sled fixture (Fig. 5). The suit had adjustable abdominal supports which were securely tightened to minimize blood pooling in the pelvic girdle and the lower extremities. The suit was open at the steering wheel rim impact site. Since no surgical procedures were performed on the swine during the suspension, the concentra- tion of halothane was reduced to maintain a level of 0.5Í. With these provisions, the 6.213</page><page sequence="5">swine retained normal cardio-vascular physio- logic function during vertical suspension. Just before the onset of the test, the swine was disconnected from the inhalation gases and breathed room air for less than two minutes during the sled test. Immediately following the test, the swine was returned to a dorsal recumbency and inhalation gases were reconnected. The animal showed no signs of distress or sensation during or after the experiment. It was observed for 15 minutes, sacrificed by an overdose of sodium pento- barbital ( &gt;60 mg/Kg), and a truncal necropsy was performed immediately. THE NECROPSY - The abdominal viscera were exposed by a midsagittal incision of the linea alba. Hemoperitoneum when present was noted and classified. Hemoperitoneum was considered moderate if peritoneal blood loss was less than 200 mL, hemorrhage stopped spontaneously and bleeding did not resume upon exposing the abdominal cavity to atmo- spheric pressure. Hemoperitoneum was con- sidered severe if peritoneal blood loss was more than 200 mL and hemorrhage resumed as the abdominal cavity of the sacrificed animal was exposed to atmospheric pressure, indicat- ing that hemorrhage initially stopped because peritoneal pressure equilibrated with central venous pressure. The liver, the spleen, the kidney, the stomach, and the intestines were then examined for lacerations or contusions. The number of independent tears was used as a measure of injury severity for each organ. An AIS score was assigned reflecting the overall severity of abdominal injury, the extent of concomitant hemorrhage, and possible prognosis if resuscitation were attempted . The right and left diaphragms were incised from the abdominal cavity and possi- ble pneumothorax or hemothorax were noted. The thoracic cavity was exposed by bisecting the left and right ribs and reflection of the sternum. Attention was paid not to interfere with any existing fractures, the number and location of which were noted. The lung, the major vessels and the pericardium were then examined for contusions or lacerations. The heart was excised from the chest. The epicardium and endocardium of all four chambers were examined for possible lacera- tions, contusions, and petechiae. All heart valves were similarly examined. To differen- tiate impact injury from possible artifacts resulting from the procedure, the necropsy was also performed on a sham operated swine which received identical treatments as the experimental swine including the vertical suspension, excluding the sled test. RESULTS INJURY - The impacts resulted in no cardiac arrhythmia among the test subjects. Only two animals from the "stiff"-wheel tests and the animal from the "rigid" wheel test died within the 15-minute observation period post impact. The immediate case of death was respiratory arrest, although they also received critical liver injuries. The other animals all breathed spontaneously following the experiments. Gross necropsy showed that liver laceration was the only abdominal injury. Liver injury ranged from none to extensive laceration. The most frequently observed lacerations were tears of the Glisson1 s membrane and submembrane tissue (Fig. 8a). A less frequent but more critical injury was laceration of the central venous junction between lobes (Fig. 8b). Junctional lacerations always resulted in severe hemoperitoneum, an immediate potential threat to life. The most severe thoracic injury was multiple rib fractures. None of the thoracic injury appeared life threatening. Pulmonary injury was restricted to isolated areas of contusion. The only cardiac injury observed were occasional petechiae on the endocardium. No tearing of valves or chordae tendineae were noted. No cases of hemothorax or pneumothorax were observed. The aortic, the pulmonary and the vena cavai blood vessels received no injury.

Analy- sis of injury outcome as a function of steer- ing wheel parameters is given in Table 2. Thoracic injury (number of rib fractures) was not influenced by column angle, spoke posi- tion, or rim deflection stiffness in these tests. Rib fractures ranged in number from 0 to 14. Liver laceration was strongly influenced by the wheel deformation characteristic, a possible influence of column angle, but appears unaffected by spoke position. All eight animals in the f,stiff,f-wheel tests received critical to fatal liver injury, regardless of spoke position or column angle. The livers in five of the test animals were clearly irrepairable and likely fatal. Liver lacerations in these cases were extensive and involved all the major lobes. Liver lacera- tion for the test with the "rigid" rim response of the simulated wheel was greatly increased compared with the worst case for the "stiff" version of the two-spoke steering wheel, and thus only one test was performed because of the severe outcome. By contrast, only three of eight animals in the "soft"- wheel tests received minor liver laceration. The other five animals sustained no abdominal injuries. The difference of liver injury 6.215</page><page sequence="7">between the "stiff"- and "soft"-wheel groups was obvious and statistically significant judged by the assigned AIS values. The dif- ference was even greater based on the actual number of liver lacerations. Since hemoperi- toneum resulted from the liver lacerations, there was also a parallel difference in the occurrence and the severity of hemoperitoneum between the "stiff"- and "soft"-wheel groups. STEERING INTERACTION MECHANICS - The interaction mechanics can be viewed from laboratory (stationary) coordinates (Fig. 9), steering assembly coordinates (Fig. 10), or subject coordinates (Fig. 11). The sled was accelerated to test velocity before signifi- cant interaction of the rim with the abdomen, while the surrogate remained stationary. The rim would have compressed the abdomen at con- stant (test) velocity except for possible whole body motion of the surrogate, or motion of the rim relative to the sled by column compression or wheel deformation. However, the force generated by the rim compressing the abdomen was insufficient to produce significant whole body motion of the surro- gate or column compression, which were initi- ated only by the greater forces associated with hub loading on the thorax. Hub contact occurred about 15 ms after abdominal contact. The only mechanism reducing abdominal com- pression response at test velocity before thoracic loading was wheel deformation. Since the "rigid" and "stiff" wheels exhibited relatively little wheel deforma- tion, most of the sled displacement resulted in abdominal compression. The "soft" wheel exhibited relatively large deformation (Fig. 10) which reduced the velocity and extent of abdominal compression (Fig. 11). CORRELATION BETWEEN INJURY AND MEASURED RESPONSES - Abdominal injury represented by AIS correlated significantly with the maximum "viscous" response [V(t)*C( t) ]max, and ade- quately with maximum abdominal compression, [ C ( t ) ] max, (Table 3). There was no correla- Table 3 - Correlation of AIS liver injury with response parameters Correlation Coefficient ( R) p-Value 3 ms Lower Spine Acceleration 0.46 0.0712 Maximum Abdominal Compression 0.62 0.0077 Maximum [ V( t )*C( t) ] 0.72 0.0012 ♦Probability that the value of the correlation coefficient (R) or greater will occur when in fact no correlation exists. 60-1 ' 'STIFF" WHEEL ✓ "SOFT' WHEEL ^ SLED/ ^ &gt;/ / RIM ^ i - 4°- X X- i /X/ACK § 20~ oX- - , - I 1 ¡ 1 0 15 30 45 60 75 TIME (ms) Fig. 9 Movement of the sled, the lower rim of the wheel, and the back of the surrogate in laboratory coordinates.

This suggests that dummy injury assessment for abdominal loading by the steering system should be based on measurement of the abdominal deformation as a function of time. DISCUSSION TEST ENVIRONMENT - A wide range of occupant alignments and impact severities and directions relative to the steering assembly occur in car crashes. Variations in vehicle design, vehicle crash kinematics, and vehicle crush all affect loading conditions for the occupant. Human factors such as occupant size, seating position, posture and reactions to an imminent crash provide additional vari- ation. The response of the steering assembly strongly depends on impact severity and occu- pant alignment (5,6). The test environment in this study was chosen to focus on abdomi- nal loading by the lower rim. The torso of the surrogate was upright with slight forward bowing before contact. This alignment of the surrogate to the steering assembly promotes interaction of the lower rim with the abdomen by delaying the contact between the hub and the thorax. Such an impact environment should be considered as one of various pos- sibilities, depending on factors such as the knee impact with the vehicle interior. The test results were independent of the sled acceleration vs. time profiles because test velocity was reached prior to abdominal com- pression. The test severity provided a range of injury outcomes depending on the steering assembly parameters. TEST SUBJECT - The 50-Kg swine was chosen for these experiments because we needed a physiological model which offered a good approximation of human function and size. At the midsternum and the impact site, the anterior-posterior dimensions of the experi- mental model were 27.2 ± 1.7 cm and 26.3 ± 1.5 cm, respectively. That compares favorably with similar dimensions of a 50th percentile male. The subject mass also approximated that of a 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummy interacting with the steering system. Slightly greater column compression occurred with the test subjects than for a seated Hybrid III dummy in a similar sled exposure, suggesting a slightly greater effective mass for the swine. The pelvic structure of the swine differs from that of the human and cannot be restrained similarly by a lap belt. The swine also lacks human-like knees which interact with the instrument panel and help to restrain the occupant in a crash. In a previous study where lap belts were used on swine (22), fatal abdominal injury resulted from belt loading. In the present study, we used an independent belt around each leg which restrained the lower torso with no abdominal loading. Together with the special adapta- tional support for the vertically suspended quadruped, the swine appears to be a good injury model for upper-abdominal loading by the rim under these controlled conditions. The swine was successfully used as an injury model for the torso in previous impact studies (12-16). One other study suggested that the swine was an unsuitable surrogate because of inconsistent hardware performance (22), a problem not encountered in our study. INFLUENCE OF STEERING SYSTEM PARAMETERS - Among the steering wheel parameters, wheel stiffness had the greatest influence on the severity of abdominal injury. The spoke vertical configuration represents a stiffer contact interface than the spoke across con- figuration (Fig. 3) but no difference in injury was observed. The spoke vertical con- figuration of the "stiff" wheel had a greater abdominal contact area on impact, abdominal loading was distributed on the rim and the spoke, whereas it was concentrated on the rim in the spoke across configuration. There- fore, the effects of increased wheel stiff- ness and increased contact area may have compensated for each other in the spoke vertical configuration. The greater inter- action force over a larger contact area resulted in no apparent difference in abdominal injury or kinematics. Spoke position did not affect the extent of wheel deformation, another indication of a compen- sating mechanism. Column angle had no measurable influence on injury outcome for the "stiff" wheel - all subjects had an AIS 5 liver injury. How- ever, column angle appears to be a factor for the "soft" wheel tests - at least on an AIS basis. AIS increases from 0 for no injury to 4 for any liver laceration but can be no greater than 5 for extensive liver lacera- tion. Thus AIS is not a sensitive indicator of the extent of liver laceration. The number of liver lacerations does not suggest a strong correlation of injury with column angle. The loading severities represented by the "stiff" and "soft" wheels are near the injury extremes. Analysis of the influence of other factors might be more meaningful at an intermediate loading severity. ABDOMINAL PROTECTION MECHANICS - The respective kinematics of the "stiff"- and "soft"-wheel tests explain the reduced abdominal compression and rates of compres- sion and thus the reduced "viscous" response and injury by the "soft" wheel. There was no column compression and rearward displacement of the spine until after 15 ms of abdominal contact by the lower rim of the wheel. For that 15 ms, only the wheel or the abdomen could deform to account for the instantaneous sled displacement. Since the "soft" wheel 6.217</page><page sequence="9">deformed significantly more than the "stiff" wheel (Fig. 10) the instantaneous abdominal compression and velocity of compression (Fig. 11) were similarly reduced in the "soft"-wheel tests. Even the "stiff" wheel had appreciable deformation at this time; and an increase in wheel stiffness further exacerbates abdominal injury as exhibited by the "rigid" wheel test. We observed that the maximum "viscous" response occurred before column compression initiated, and hypothesize that liver injury is occurring before column compression. Thus abdominal protection must be provided by steering wheel characteristics . In our test environment, the lower rim contacted the abdomen before the hub con- tacted the thorax. Column compression and significant whole body motions were associ- ated with the greater force due to thoracic loading. A wheel with a deep dish would delay thoracic contact and might increase the potential for abdominal compression. Occu- pant alignment with the steering wheel at contact is an important parameter. In our tests abdominal compression by the rim did not produce sufficient force to cause column compression. If column compression force is reduced to protect the abdomen from rim loading, the column would have a signifi- cantly lower energy absorbing capacity than it has today which would affect the higher severity collision protection of drivers well-aligned with the steering wheel. Severe frontal crashes require high energy absorp- tion capacity which implies high column com- pression forces. Thus the wheel, not the column, is probably the steering system com- ponent best suited to limit compression of the abdomen. For our test situation and results, the data suggest that the rim and spoke should deform before sufficient force is developed to produce a high level of "viscous" response and abdominal compression. However, the test environment represents only one of many occupant interaction configurations. Thus, other loading conditions and body regions should be considered in a full analysis of occupant protection provided by the steering system.
