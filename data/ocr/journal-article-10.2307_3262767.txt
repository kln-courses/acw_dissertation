<plain_text><page sequence="1">125 BOOK REVIEWS a feeling for Israel's tragedy represents the dialectic in Yahweh's own purpose to judge and to save, rather than any supposed humanity on the prophet's part, resisting the demands of divine intractability. These two prophets, only the most eloquent among a number of possible OT witnesses, prefigure a NT fulfillment in which the same God at last supremely reveals his concern in the life of one human being completely attuned to his purpose. lWauser passes by other NT interpreters of the incarnation in order to elucidate the following items in Paul's theology: (1) that God's act is Christ's act; (2) that the Christ who is now glorified is the earthly Jesus; (3) that Jesus' life introduced the climactic time of God's wrath, along with God's salvation; (4) that human covetousness turned the law, intended for life, into pride, sin, and death, but Jesus restored life by fulfilling the law in obedience, suffering, and self-abasement; (5) that in Jesus' passive act God was victoriously at work. Thus Jesus in his earthly life fully embodied the work of God, both of judgment and of salvation, fulfilling the prophetic ideal. Though he had no biographical concern, Paul did have a theology of Jesus' life, seen by Mauser as the crown and climax of biblical belief. This is a claim that challenges the dominant position in current biblical theology. The trend in NT studies has been to follow Wrede in glorifying a transcendentalized Christ at the neglect of the historical Jesus. But OT scholars stand on essentially the same ground when they apologize for the seeming grossness and primitivity of the Hebraic presentation, exalting the NT's presumed higher spirituality. Lately some have been rais- ing their voices in the opposite direction, Abraham Heschel most forcefully, urging that a suffering, feeling, and acting God may be more theologically meaningful than a Deity that is unqualified in the power of absolute being, remote from the agonies and triumphs of human life. Thus Mauser's book is one that demands attention, in spite of some weaknesses. It is eclectic, suggesting by selection the need for a comprehensive study. The first two chapters, following neither a historical nor a systematic approach to the problem of anthropomorphism, need a better organitation. But what has been done has enough strength in it to justify serious thought whether the truly unique element in biblical theology as a whole gi^ing essential unity to the two parts of the Canon may indeed prove to be the concept of God involving himself in human life.

According to Professor Watts, when writing his foreward, "the critical winds . . . no longer blow so strongly toward the search for synthesis," as they did in the '50'S, when his work was largely conceived; nevertheless, he expresses - quite properly - the</page><page sequence="2">126 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE conviction that "one dare not lose sight of the forest while marking the trees." Modern structural analysis, it may be noted, recognizes that a naturally existing phenomenon does not ordinarily exhibit perfect unity, but rather various degrees of integration; for measur- ing the degree, mathematical formulas have been developed. Historically, the interests of post-feudal ( largely "bourgeois" ) society have focused heavily on differentiations in biblical and other materials, and have led to the discovery of many divergencies within the Bible and between it and other literatures. The recognition of these, however, can be balanced by a perception of interrelations (often associated with socialist predilections, as in H. Gunkel). It is likely that the recent breakdown of syntheses is a temporary phenomenon, marking the transition to a new comprehension. Watts' attempt to see patterns can thus be justified in principle, even though complete coherence cannot be shown and new structural recognitions may be needed. Watts' study pays attention to three patterns: "patriarchal," "amphictyonic," "mon- archical," but leaves unclear the interrelation between these. The author promises a future study of their role in the writings of Israelite theologians. One must thus await his further contributions in order to obtain a meaningful assessment of the biblical message. More comprehensive in scope is the work by Professor Lehman. Like Menno Simmons, Lehman expresses a Christocentric view. The Hebrew scriptures are viewed largely in terms of the making, breaking, and reconstituting of a divine-human relationship; it is not difficult to see that such analysis can serve as a background for an understanding of the NT. The social norms receive only a brief discussion, although what is said (pp. 164-65, 432) includes a reference to the anti-usury laws ignored in many Protestant theologies of the OT. In line with the Mennonite tradition, Lehman believes that capital punishment has been abolished after the OT period (p. 77). Lehman holds to an "organic" view of revelation, which incorporates the dimensions of "unity" and "progress"; in this he follows J. H. Titcomb (1851, 1871, 1874) and other traditional theologians. Indeed, the idea of progressive revelation, although parti- cularly strong in the nineteenth century, had an important starting point in earlier Christian views concerning the relation between the Testaments, especially so in Mennonite inter- pretation. The evolutionary perspective, however, is limited largely to the time before the NT. In matters of detail, Lehman's historical standpoint is very mildly critical. He accepts, for instance, the existence of a J Document (p. 87), although it is not carefully described. The theology of Isaiah 40-66 is treated separately from that of chs. 1-39, but nevertheless in conjunction with preexilic prophecy. A rather different perspective is embodied in Understognding tbe Old Testament, edited by O. Jessie Lace. This volume includes chapters on "OT and Apocrypha," "The Context of the OT," "The History of Religion in Israel," and "What the OT is About." The second of these comes from the pen of D. R. Ap-Thomas, the rest from the editor. In contrast to Lehman's statement that "the almost limitless evidence from archaeology com- pletely confirms the historicity of the Pentateuchal contents" (p. 35 ), Ap-Thomas observes that one "can only occasionally say that archaeological discovery has proved the cor- rectness of some historical circumstance mentioned in the Bible" (p. 40). Lace's treatment of the religion of Israel looks in part at the human form of biblical faith. "Evidence of many different kinds suggests that man's first wonderings and question- ings have been about himself, his identity and his relationships with other human beings and with the rest of his environment" (p. 3). A central problem is man's confidence; according to Lace, "the honest and thoughtful man recognizes that he is a mixture of</page><page sequence="3">128 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE strength and weakness" (p. 107). Appropriately, then, a "strong conviction of man's worth, power, and responsibility rings through the Old Testament, in spite of much lamentation about his failure to live up to his calling" (p. 106). An important aspect of Israelite confidence lies in its view of the environment's basically postive and encourag- ing relation to man, derived from a God of love. According to Lace, moral rules arise from social experience (p. 110); one can observe a development of ethical thought in Israelite history (p. 134). Lace, however, does not execute a human perspective consistently. The cause of such failure appears to lie in the relative detachment of much of recent theology from twentieth-century anthropological study (including the history of religions, sociology, and psychology). Thus no extensive body of relevant observations and arguments has been accumulated by biblical scholarships, even to be debated. One can mention as possibilities for discusion: the similarity of the figure of Moses to that of the typical revolutionary (a person with a background in an oppressed group, whose social limitations he has partly overcome) and the cIose affinity of Israelite eschatology to that of so-called "messianic" movements under analogous circumstances. Analyses of receptive states of awareness and of many other psychological processes, such as approach and avoidance, deserve incorpora- tion into the theoretical framework of biblical studies. The three volumes are interesting largely because of the theoretical issues they raise, and in particular because of their involvement in the question of whether a comprehensive theory is possible for OT study. Although present possibilities may have been realized only very partially, one can be grateful for the steps taken and hope that future work wi!l build upon the contributions presented. MARTIN J.

Each is important for writing the history of how scielltific research on the life of Jesus was articulated in a theologically meaningful way for Christian faith. Each deserves republication together with the serious scrutiny and consideration which such renewed circulation hopefully will facilitate. Because of the historical and theological significance of each of these books, one would antecedently expect the editors in both introductions and annotations to set each author in his historical context, both with regard to the various developments in modern Protestant theology and to Leben-Jes-lSorschgng. With one notable exception, they have all succeeded admirably in this task.</page></plain_text>
