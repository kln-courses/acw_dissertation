He trembles at the abyss into awesome power and that effective language must incarnate which his bodily eyes look down, or look up; not knowing that thought.

(Works 15:401; emphasis supplied) These two theorists of the sublime, while irreconcila ble, both influence De Quincey, who remains in the middle, at times holding with a Kantian Coleridge that "we receive but what we give," and at times taking the empirical position of Burke, asserting a passivity of the mind in "the profound experience of the relations subsisting between ourselves and nature—that not always are we called upon to seek; some times, and in childhood above all, we are sought"; one be comes aware, he says, citing Wordsworth, of "pow'rs / Which of themselves our minds impress" (Masson, De Quincey's Writ ings 1:122; De Quincey's emphasis). The divisions of the Confessions—"The Pleasures of Opium" and "The Pains of Opium"—echo both epistemolog ical and aesthetic concerns. They hint that this autobio graphical work is a treatise on such subjects as the psychology and aesthetics of the beautiful and the sublime and ironically introduce a means (the effects of opium) of expanding and revising existing theories. De Quincey's admiration for Burke as a writer is nearly unalloyed (Burke is "the supreme De Quincey's fascination with the structure of knowl edge, the relationship of mind to nature, and the linguistic links in that relationship lay behind his own hybrid episte mology.9 De Quincey is pulled in two ways. For example, he is an outspoken admirer of Hartley's Observations on Man, finding it marked by "architectural grace," with "the spotless beauty and ideal proportions of some Grecian statue." At the same time, however, De Quincey, an avowed Trinitarian, ob jects to the "shallow Unitarianism" to which Hartley's system leads, and claims that he himself "never attempted to bring all things within the mechanic understanding [emphasis sup plied]," his mind demanding "mysteries" in the system of mysteries that "connect[s] us with another world" and find ing mysteries as well in "mere physical nature" ( Works 19:312 13). De Quincey's attitude toward Kant is similarly ambiva lent. He praises him, spends a good deal of space explaining his terms, and ranks him, along with Plato, a "great philoso pher" ( Works 3:96). At the same time, however, he rejects Kant's philosophy, as he has Hartley's, on religious grounds—Kant's atheism, his "essentially destructive" .... , r , , , r ntellect writer of his century, the man of the largest and finest under standing"), but he rejects his reliance on the mechanical un derstanding.

The sublime, he says, is adapting some notions and adding his own gained under the that which inspires a passion similar to terror by "producing influence of opium—the doorway to dreams, and dreams the an unnatural tension and certain violent emotions of the path to the rhetorical unconscious and to "mystery," which in nerves" (134).

For Kant, some of the questions I am concerned with.

The first, from the Autobiographic Sketches, opens vocation even over nature" (Kant 145).11 Kant's sublime is an analysis of De Quincey's epistemology and psychology, the the inner space of the noumenal self; the mind, like the uni- textual nature of mind, its "depths," and its construction of verse, is infinite.

The incongruous relation In the present instance, an important contrast, an "an- ship between life and death struggles to resolve itself, as De tagonism between the tropical redundancy of life in summer, Quincey makes clear in another version of this episode, as a and the frozen sterilities of the grave" ( Works 15 142), reveals dimly apprehended but "mighty relation between God and itself in the present but invokes a key component of the death."

The mind cannot know its own destination. De Quincey's epistemology is a "perplexed combina tion" not only of empiricism and idealism, but also of aesthet ics, rhetoric, metaphysics, and psychology that—like his involutes—is "incapable of being disentangled." To ques tions about what can be known and how, his answers ac knowledge the role of the senses while implicating language, text, and figure. One can know the world of the eye, but as à speaking thing, a system of signs, many of them divinely in scribed. One can know the messages of one's own dreams, which offer wormholes into the "shadowy" and translate eve rything into their own language. One can know through dreams that God and his minions are semioticians, working "by signs in heaven, . . . heraldries painted on darkness, and hieroglyphics written on the tablets of the brain." One can know at moments of jeopardy or illumination the text of the mind, which eradicates time and reduces a life to a moment, displaying "the simultaneity of arrangement under which the past events of life, though in fact successive, had formed their dread line of revelation." Finally, one can know that none of the messages from any source is intelligible in itself. All are figurative; all require translation and interpretation: "theirs were the symbols; mine are the words." And despite the best efforts of one's "deciphering oracle," the messages can hold fast their secrets and shadowy meanings through a lifetime. NOTES 'Citations to De Quincey's Works are to the Lindop edition unless otherwise specified. 2Curtis Perry points out that De Quincey's is the first use of the word "sub-conscious" entered in the OED. And Charles L. Proudfit, "Thomas De Quincey and Sigmund Freud," analyzes the ways in which De Quincey anticipates Freud. Daniel Sanjiv Roberts, "Exor cising the Malay," explores De Quincey's "gloomy satisfaction for 'the dark recesses of his own soul'—a consistent representation . . . of the unconscious," to which he later refers as "infected forms of the unconscious" (91, 96). 3 Among empirical philosophers, unconscious knowledge is an oxymoron. John Locke asks, "Whence has [the mind] all the materi als of reason and knowledge?" He answers in a word, "Experi ence"—that is, primarily, sensation, and secondarily, reflection. Thought, Locke insists, must be conscious, active, and retained in the memory; unconscious thought—that alleged to take place in dreams, for instance—is incredible to Locke, or, granting that it ex ists, he finds it useless: "To think often, and never to retain it so much as one moment, is a very useless sort of thinking; and the soul, in such a state of thinking, does very little, if at all, excel that of a looking-glass. . . Acceptance of the idea of unconscious mental activity would reduce the mind to the status of "dull and senseless matter" (Essay 2.1.3-15). 4In his portrayal, De Quincey speaks into being a tropological divine that constitutes an essential element of his epistemology and demonstrates what Mark C. Taylor calls "the appearance of a radi cally new experience of the sacred". (3). Harold Bloom might see De Quincey's depiction of the relationship of God to man as similar to the Gnostic view of the relation of God to human beings, a relation ship built on catastrophe—citing Emerson, "There is a crack in eve rything that God has made" (65) 5In 1687 in his Principia Mathematica, Isaac Newton offered his elegant description of the universal machine, thus bringing to a cul mination the efforts of sixteenth and seventeenth century scientists to create a mathematical model of nature. Three years later, in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke became the first philosopher to formulate a model of human beings capable of inhabiting the new world of science. His chief concern was episte mological, in effect with placing the human mind in the Newtonian world machine, coming to conclusions about the relationship be tween mind and universe, and defining the nature, scope and limits of human knowledge. His associationist philosophy was elaborated by, among others, David Hartley, a philosopher somewhat nearer the Romantic period and an acknowledged influence on the intellectual community. Hartley was an ardent admirer of both Newton and Locke. He explains that he took hints from Newton's Principia and Optics as to "the Performance of Sensation and Motion" from which he developed his theory of Vibrations; and he took from "Mr. Locke, and other ingenious Persons since his Time," hints "concerning the Influence of Association over our Opinions and Affections, and its Use in explaining those Things in an accurate and precise Way ..." (Observations on Man 1:431). These two doctrines (of Vibrations and Association) were intended to explain respectively the mechanisms by which the body and mind operate. 6In his essays on Coleridge, De Quincey notices the plagiarism from Schelling—inexplicable to De Quincey since Coleridge could, he says, have produced "from the loom of is own magical brain, theo ries more gorgeous by far. . (Works 10:292). Later in the same series of essays, De Quincey seems to endorse a form of Coleridgean transcendentalism: in the "Dejection Ode" Coleridge "illustrates the truth that all which we find in Nature must be created by ourselves" (Works 10:332), yet De Quincey in his own work continues to give "Nature" a kind of awesome power. 7The self (SUM or I AM), he says, "is a subject which becomes a subject by the act of constructing itself objectively to itself; but which never is an object except for itself, and only so far as by the very same act it becomes a subject" (Biographia Literaria 12:297-8; 7:222). In time, both Wordsworth and Coleridge, along with many of their contemporaries, moved dispiritedly back toward empiricism and away from a view of the mind's dominance over nature, often expressed as the loss of "vision." Writing to James Gillman in 1825, Coleridge puts it this way: "Nature is sure to get the better of Lady Mind in the long run and to take her revenge too; transforms our to day into a canvas dead-coloured to receive the dull, featureless por trait of yesterday. . . " (Letters 2:743). 169</page><page sequence="13">8A host of epistemoiogical, psychological, and rhetorical spec ulations arises from Locke's semiotic theory. Locke argued that lan guage is crucial to epistemology. As he puts it, "The Consideration then of Ideas and Words, as the great Instruments of Knowledge, makes no despicable part of their contemplation, who would take a view of humane Knowledge in the whole Extent of it" (Essay 4.21.4). Ulman offers a concise review of the evolving linguistic concerns, fo cusing his attention on eighteenth-century rhetoric in the works of Campbell, Blair, and Sheridan. 9Frederick Burwick has shown that De Quincey's "underlying philosophic system" brings together in a theory of rhetoric "for the first time the principal elements of Scottish associationism and Ger man aesthetics [indebted especially to Friedrich Schiller's concepts of resistive opposition and play]" ("Introduction" xiii). Burwick's finding that De Quincey's rhetorical theory emerges from the con vergence of the two philosophical systems and concerns, the rhetori cal and the aesthetic, identifies one source of the complexity in his rhetorical theory and accounts for the odd shifts, incongruities, and originality in his epistemology. 10Locke claims that "in all things that environ and affect us" God has "scattered up and down several degrees of pleasure and pain." These then are "blended together in almost all that our thoughts have to do with" (Essay 2.7.5; and see 2.1-2). Hartley de scribed a gradual shift as the mind matures—from sensible pleasures and pains to intellectual pleasures and pains. Pleasures associated with language—"from articulate sounds"—are intellectual (Observa tions 1:223, 234). 11 In the discussion of genius and imagination, Kant establishes the domination of mind over nature: "The imagination (as a pro ductive cognitive faculty) is, namely, very powerful in creating an other nature, out of the material which the real one gives it. . . . [I]n this we feel our freedom from the law of association (which applies to the empirical use of that faculty), in accordance with which material can certainly be lent to us by nature, but the latter can be transformed by us into something entirely different, namely into that which steps beyond nature" (Kant 192; emphasis supplied). 12 Hartley includes the claim that a number of sensations exper ienced simultaneously will tend to infuse their respective vibrations to each other in the brain substance, subtly modifying each other, so that subsequent experience of one of these will excite the modified corresponding vibration relating to it in the brain substance, but also those others with which it has been experienced (Observations 1:77-80). lsIn his essay on "Milton versus Southey and Landor," De Quin cey comments: "[I]f I had a doppel-gänger who went about person ating me, copying me, and pirating me, philosopher as I am I might ... be so far carried away by jealousy as to attempt the crime of murder upon his carcase; and no great matter as regards HIM" (Works 11:460-61), On first encountering the Malay, De Quincey does in fact hand him a lethal dose of opium—"enough to kill some half-dozen dragoons, together with their horses" (Works 2:235). Charles J. Rzepka argues that the Malay is so frightening because he is a figure for De Quincey's "anonymous reading public" (5); Daniel O'Quinn offers a view of the Malay as representing the Orient, all that is non-English, absolute alterity ("an otherness that does not act as the foil required for the consolidation of individual identity"). The Malay is dehumanized as thing and then "animalized": "He seems to flutter between animal and thing" (150). However, as Bur wick says, De Quincey displays "the hermeneutic utility of the princi ple of identity in alterity, first posited in his commentary to Lessing, and its corollary, concord in discord, with which he endeavors to resolve the aporia of the incongruous figures" ("Lessing's Laokoon" 269). The scene, a verbal painting, represents concord in the appar ent discord, the hidden, unconscious dimensions of himself figured in the incongruity of the child and the Malay. He is the child; he is the Malay, his own double, revealing that at some level he is multi ple—child and adult, of the Orient as well as of England, as the quo tation from "The English Mail-Coach," cited above, demonstrates. 14Miller finds that all of De Quincey's works represent his "in ner world," a "mirror to [the] mightier abyss" of universal space and time ( The Disappearance of God 27). Daniel Roberts similarly claims, "In a sense all of De Quincey's writings constitute his autobiography" (53). 15De Quincey is thinking of a supernatural "communication" known as sortilegy, a process whereby words become media for "hy perphysical" messages, related to "echo augury," Also discussed in "Infant Literature" ( Works 19:68-77) and "Modern Superstition" (Works 11:513 ffi). 16In "The Works of Alexander Pope," De Quincey distinguishes the "discursive understanding" from heart, "the great intuitive (or non-discursive) organ, to be the interchangeable formula for man in his highest state of capacity for the infinite" (Works 16:337). 17Prose in a literary movement primarily concerned with po etry, according to Jakobson, is "defined both in those places where it is influenced by the dominant, that is, the poetic, element, and in those where it breaks free from that influence" (Language in Litera ture 302). De Quincey is such a prose writer but whether the age dictates his reliance on metaphor or provides the means for expres sing his unique philosophy is uncertain. 18In Chapters 5 through 7 of the Biographia Literaria, Coleridge, at once fascinated and horrified by associationism, finally rejects it: "our whole life would be divided between the despotism of outward impressions and that of the senseless and passive memory" (Coler idge 215), so that, as he says, the Biographia Literaria itself "may be as truly said to be written by Saint Paul's church, as by me: for it is the mere motion of my muscles and nerves; and these again are set in motion from external causes equally passive, which external causes stand themselves in interdependent connection with everything that exists or has existed' (Coleridge 219; emphasis supplied). For David Hart ley, the universe, man, and his mind were joined in a vibrating, unify ing motion of imperceptible particles, all subject to "natural law" (Observations 1:79-8 0). 170</page><page sequence="14">19De Quincey makes his tendency to digress a virtue in the auto biography, the "somewhat arbitrary" episodes "confessedly rambling, and whose very duly lies in the pleasant paths of vagrancy." (Works 19:206; emphasis supplied). 20"Thou shalt wander without rest until the last day" (Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend, 28). 21According to Miller, the vision in the sister's death chamber represents "the initial moment of self-awareness, an awareness made possible only when the self "contracts to a point and sinks into the solitude of itself," finding itself, citing De Quincey, " 'a dim lotus of human consciousness . . . afloat upon the bosom of waters without a shore'" (Disappearance of God 20). 22This identification of the beloved sister with the "sexually sus pect" woman is intriguing, but requires an essay in its own right. Tim Fulford's suggestive discussion of the moment when De Quincey's "beautiful female forms give way to a perverse and incestuous mon ster" (161) is pertinent as is Grevel Lindop's analysis of De Quincey's reaction to the death of KateWordsworth (The Opium Eater 197-202).
