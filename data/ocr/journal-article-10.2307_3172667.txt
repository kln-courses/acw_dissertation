<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRIS T. ALLEN and CHRIS A. JANISZEWSKI* The authors investigate a basic mechanism for shaping attitudes that has largely been ignored by empirical researchers in the marketing discipline. Two experiments are reported in which traditional Pavlovian procedures are merged with a view of conditioning that encourages theorizing about attendant cognitive processes. The data indicate that contingency learning or awareness may be a requirement for successful attitudinal conditioning. Contingency awareness entails conscious recog- nition of the relational pattern between the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli used in a conditioning procedure. In experiment 1, the conditioning procedure af- fected the evaluative judgments of subjects who were classified (post hoc) as con- tingency aware. In experiment 2, instructions that promoted contingency learning as part of the procedure again influenced participants' attitude judgments. Impli- cations are offered for theory development and for constructing advertisements to foster attitudinal conditioning. Specific suggestions for further research on how one might structure television commercials to foster contingency learning also are pre- sented. Assessing the Role of Contingency Awareness in Attitudinal Conditioning with Implications for Advertising Research Several forces herald a growing interest in classical conditioning in the field of marketing. Fundamentally, the popular view that individuals often approach con- sumption in an uninvolved way (e.g., Kassarjian 1978, 1986; Olshavsky and Granbois 1979) fosters an interest in learning mechanisms entailing minimal cognitive ac- tivity (Allen and Madden 1985). Because "classical (Pavlovian) conditioning traditionally and historically has been considered to be an automatic, reflexive, and non- cognitive learning process" (Dawson et al. 1982, p. 274), the inference that conditioning mechanisms are germane in uninvolving consumption contexts (e.g., Gorn 1982; Greenwald and Leavitt 1984; Holbrook and O'Shaugh- nessy 1984; Kroeber-Riel 1984; Shimp 1981) appears reasonable. Marketing researchers' interest in low involvement ad processing is producing a body of work in which clas- sical conditioning is as a key theoretical explanation. This work often features a distinction between central and pe- ripheral routes to persuasion and presents conditioned learning as one explanation for the proposed influence of peripheral cues such as famous endorsers (e.g., Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983) or pleasant music (e.g., Gorn 1982). Similarly, research on attitude toward the ad (Aad) began with (cf. Mitchell and Olson 1981; Shimp 1981) and continues to rely on (e.g., Gardner 1985; MacKenzie, Lutz, and Belch 1986) classical condition- ing as the explanation for Aad's role as a causal media- tor. Other forces that may add to the interest in condition- ing frameworks derive from recent debates about strat- egies for knowledge development. A major point argued by relativists is that many research approaches can con- Journal of Marketing Research Vol. XXVI (February 1989), 30-43 *Chris T.

An- derson 1983, 1986; Hirschman 1986; Peter and Olson 1983). However, some suggest that consumer and ad- vertising research has been dominated by epistemology associated with psychology's cognitivist tradition (cf. Anderson 1983, 1986; Holbrook and Hirschman 1982; Nord and Peter 1980; Peter and Olson 1987, p. 279; Preston 1982). Behaviorist paradigms thus are portrayed as a natural supplement to the traditional cognitivist approach' (Anderson 1983; Holbrook and Hirschman 1982; Kassarjian 1986; Nord and Peter 1980; Peter and Olson 1987, Ch. 9; Preston 1982). Notably, advocates of behaviorist approaches empha- size their value in supplying guidelines for general mar- keting practice (Nord and Peter 1980; Peter and Olson 1987, Ch. 9, 10) and specific advertising decisions (Gorn 1982; Holbrook and O'Shaughnessy 1984; Preston 1982). McSweeney and Bierley (1984) offer hypotheses about the application of conditioning principles that have been refined into specific advertising guidelines (Engel, Blackwell, and Miniard 1986, p. 172-6). Given the emergence of the conditioning framework as a (1) theoretical explanation, (2) metatheoretic alter- native, and (3) heuristic for generating practical guide- lines, the paucity of marketing research on the effects of conditioning is bothersome. There is ample evidence that Pavlovian procedures can be used to condition reflexive responses, but what such evidence implies about human preference is not obvious. Though the cognitive re- sources invested in many consumption decisions may be minimal, an assumption that low involvement preference formation approximates an involuntary reflex certainly needs empirical validation. The mixed support for the conditioning hypothesis in recent consumer studies (Al- len and Madden 1985; Bierley, McSweeney, and Van- nieuwkerk 1985; Gorn 1982; Gresham and Shimp 1985; Macklin 1986) and the long-standing controversy in so- cial psychology about whether or not attitudes can be conditioned (e.g., Fishbein and Ajzen 1975; Page 1969, 1974; Petty and Cacioppo 1981; Staats 1969) emphasize the need for empirical work. As McSweeney and Bierley (1984, p. 620) observe, ". . . the role of classical con- ditioning in consumer behavior and the accuracy of spe- cific implications need to be established by careful ex- periments." RESEARCH PURPOSE Legitimizing conditioning research for a marketing audience is accomplished most efficiently by noting that classical conditioning can be conceived as one of the ba- sic mechanisms of attitude formation (e.g., Bagozzi et al. 1979; Greenwald 1968; Petty and Cacioppo 1981). Given the field's historical emphasis on the attitude con- struct, the fact that we know so little about this basic mechanism is remarkable. The general goal of our re- search is to add to empirically based knowledge about the effects of conditioning procedures in shaping atti- tudes. McSweeney and Bierley (1984) emphasize that it is difficult to generate support for a conditioning hypoth- esis without adhering to meticulous Pavlovian proce- dures. Many of McSweeney and Bierley's guidelines were adopted in the two experiments reported herein; how- ever, these experiments also diverge from a traditional Pavlovian agenda by attempting to ascertain the me- diating impact of contingency awareness. The data up- hold the value of an awareness construct in building the- ory about attitudinal conditioning. To furnish the context for a discussion of the diverse ways in which psychol- ogists have treated the awareness issue, we first contrast Pavlovian and attitudinal conditioning. CONTRASTING THE PAVLOVIAN PARADIGM AND ATTITUDINAL CONDITIONING Pavlovian conditioning has occurred when a previ- ously neutral stimulus (the conditioned stimulus or CS) begins to evoke a reflexive response that formerly had been associated with some other stimulus (the uncon- ditioned stimulus or US). Much of the modern Pavlovian research is formulated around the eyeblink reflex in an- imals and human beings, but heart rate, electrical skin resistance, and blood pressure also are commonly stud- ied (e.g., Hall 1976; Schwartz 1978). "In virtually all cases, researchers have observed the same phenomena that Pavlov observed in studying the salivary reflex in dogs" (Schwartz 1978, p. 41). This type of research is justifiably considered equal to Skinner's operant conditioning as a true exemplar of be- haviorism. Part of the reason is historical: as noted by Dawson et al. (1982, p. 274), ". . . when the [Pavlov- ian] paradigm was exported to the United States, the pre- sumed reflexive and noncognitive nature of the learning process fit well with the flourishing behavioristic zeit- geist." The Pavlovian emphasis on how structures in en- vironmental stimuli affect behavior, and correspondent deemphasis on internal psychology, are also crucial components of the behaviorist metaphysic (cf. Anderson 1986; Schwartz 1978; Zuriff 1985). The body of work supporting Pavlov's laws is im- pressive, but marketing researchers must confront the difficult question of generalizability. How much of this empirically based wisdom about involuntary reflexes should one translate to shaping attitudes? This specific question seems to underlie a research stream that began with the Staatses' (1957, 1958, 1959) studies on the con- ditioning of evaluative meaning. 'Perhaps the most prominent behaviorist paradigm is operant con- ditioning. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is followed by a positive (or negative) reinforcer increases (or decreases) in frequency. Though Pavlovian and operant conditioning are both key components of the behaviorist tradition, we view them as fundamentally different learning mechanisms.</page><page sequence="3">32 JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1989 Conditioning Attitudes In their prototypical experiment, Staats and Staats (1957) paired visually presented nonsense syllables (the CSs) with several spoken words (the USs) chosen to re- flect common evaluative meaning (e.g., beauty, healthy, smart, success). After a series of pairings, subjects' rat- ings of the CSs indicated that the core meaning in the USs (i.e., either positive or negative evaluation) had transferred to the nonsense syllables. The Staatses con- cluded that this transfer took place without awareness, implying that attitudes could be formed via the "same" noncognitive mechanism that operates when condition- ing a Pavlovian reflex. Though the attitudinal and Pavlovian paradigms can be linked via metaphorical extrapolation, it is important to recognize their basic differences. By definition, the attitude research stream focuses on internal psychology; furthermore, researchers in this stream have been con- cerned with the cognitive activity that may be required when conditioning attitudes (cf. Insko and Oakes 1966; Page 1969, 1974; Staats 1969). Thus, unlike Pavlovian research, attitudinal conditioning cannot be character- ized as pure-form behaviorism. Rather, to borrow An- derson's (1986, p. 165) terminology, attitudinal condi- tioning is somewhere in the "seam" between cognitivism and behaviorism. Blending Research Traditions Because our project addresses attitudinal conditioning, it entails research in the seam between cognitivism and behaviorism. This point is raised for several reasons. First, our objective is not to stage an empirical "confrontation" between the two programs. Given their inherent incom- mensurability (cf. Anderson 1986), such empirical com- petitions would be inconclusive. Additionally, the proj- ect is not an attempt to make the behaviorist program more cognitive or vice versa. Rather, it builds on extant work that has involved a blending of traditions. Finally, research in this seam presents a unique opportunity for knowledge development. As Peter and Olson (1987, p. 306) suggest, ". . . cognitive approaches that attempt to describe the internal mechanisms involved in condi- tioning processes not only add insight but also help to develop more effective conditioning strategies." Pragmatic and theoretical advantages of blending cog- nitive considerations into a Pavlovian framework are noted throughout the article. Awareness has been the primary cognitive variable examined in prior research. The di- verse perspectives one can take on this variable are con- sidered next. MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES ON AWARENESS When pure-form behaviorists and cognitivists com- pare approaches, one of the debates they cannot resolve is the role of awareness in conditioning. Their debate is unresolvable because it is grounded in fundamental dif- ferences at the level of metaphysical commitments (cf. Anderson 1986; Peter and Olson 1987, Ch. 9). In be- haviorism, mental events are considered nonscientific and are not the focal point of research; hence, for the be- haviorist, the awareness issue is simply not of interest. The steadfast cognitivist, in contrast, perceives the awareness issue as pivotal. For example, Brewer (1974, p. 3) views "the hypothesis that events in conditioning come about in an automatic, unconscious fashion" as the central tenet in conditioning theory. He then dismisses six decades of conditioning research by arguing that whenever effects are observed, they will be accom- panied by conscious awareness on the part of subjects about what was expected of them. Between these incommensurable positions is a body of work in which awareness is used as a progressive con- struct for enhancing understanding. In this seam or mid- dle ground the focal variable is referred to as "contin- gency awareness." To explicate this position, we interpose it between the two other awareness views in the follow- ing discussion. Conditioning Without Awareness The Pavlovian tradition is commonly interpreted as implicating a noncognitive learning mechanism. In their attitude studies, the Staatses (1957, 1958, 1959) main- tained consistency with this position through the extrap- olation that subjects learned without awareness. Like- wise, marketing researchers have assimilated the view that conditioned learning implies some preconscious, subliminal, or otherwise noncognitive process. In mar- keting research, conditioning mechanisms are commonly portrayed as automatic (e.g., MacKenzie, Lutz, and Belch 1986; Preston 1982), nonvolitional (Shimp 1981), and even uninhibited by consciousness (Kassarjian 1986; Kroeber-Riel 1979). It is important to reiterate that a "conditioning-with- out-awareness" presumption need not follow from the Pavlovian position. As pure-form behaviorists, Pavlov- ians choose to avoid questions about the private mental events that cause or accompany conditioned learning (Dawson et al. 1982; Peter and Olson 1987, p. 301-3). Conditioning with Contingency Awareness A regular finding in conditioning research is that with repeated exposures to a CS/US combination, subjects learn that presentation of a particular US is contingent on the presence of a specific CS. This recognition of the CS/US pairing pattern is referred to as "contingency awareness." Contingency awareness seems to accom- pany successful conditioning, leading many scholars to challenge the conditioning-without-awareness view- point. As represented by Bandura (1974, p. 859): Contrary to popular belief, the fabled reflexive condi- tioning in humans is largely a myth. Conditioning is sim- ply a descriptive term for learning through paired expe- riences, not an explanation of how the change comes about. Originally, conditioning was assumed to occur automat- ically. On closer examination it turned out to be cogni-</page><page sequence="4">ASSESSING THE ROLE OF CONTINGENCY AWARENESS 33 tively mediated. People do not learn despite repetitive paired experiences unless they recognize that events are correlated. Considerable evidence supports Bandura's inference that contingency awareness acts as a causal mediator (e.g., Dawson 1973; Dawson et al. 1982; Hare 1964; Perruchet 1985; Rozelle 1968). For example, when researchers monitor contingency learning on a trial-by-trial basis, conditioning does not occur until the subject becomes aware (Baer and Fuhrer 1982; Biferno and Dawson 1977). Bandura's conclusion also is supported by work in which contingency awareness is manipulated experimentally rather than measured post hoc (cf. Grings 1973; Hall 1976). Two points are noteworthy about researchers who por- tray contingency awareness as a requirement for suc- cessful conditioning. First, though these researchers may not be pure-form behaviorists, they also are not chal- lenging the potency of conditioning procedures. Second, the idea of a noncognitive process is not dismissed com- pletely; some subscribe to Razran's (1971) two-factor theory, which postulates honcognitive and cognitively mediated conditioning (cf. Dawson et al. 1982; Grings 1973). Conditioning with Demand Awareness A more extreme viewpoint simply equates awareness with demand artifact. Following Page (1969, 1974), we refer to it as the "demand awareness" position. Demand awareness has been a concern in attitudinal conditioning (cf. Allen and Madden 1985; Fishbein and Ajzen 1975; Gorn 1982; Insko and Oakes 1966; Petty and Cacioppo 1981), but in his review Brewer (1974) broadens the cri- tique to all conditioning with adults. Brewer's thesis is that subjects develop "conscious hypotheses and expec- tations about the experiment, and these produce the re- sulting conditioning" (p. 2). Though Brewer might be dismissed as a cognitivist attacking behaviorism, the demand awareness issue is relevant for marketing research. As Page (1974, p. 486) observed: ". . . the straightforward simplicity of a con- ditioning hypothesis makes it difficult to design a study so that no subject can discern the hypothesis from the research operations." This problem is aggravated by an issue we label the "repetitions dilemma." Traditional views on conditioning suggest that more CS/US pairings will strengthen the effect; however, the dilemma in in- terpreting such an effect is that more pairings are a better cue to subjects about what is expected. Procedures that lack a rationale for the repetitive CS/US exposures seem susceptible to demand artifact (Sawyer 1975). Summary It is common in the conditioning literature to discuss the awareness issue without distinguishing contingency from demand awareness (e.g., Bierley, McSweeney, and Vannieuwkerk 1985; Brewer 1974; Gorn 1982; Staats and Staats 1957, 1958). Not drawing this distinction cre- ates dysfunctional ambiguity. In human conditioning studies, assessing the relative impact (or lack thereof) of contingency versus demand awareness would be useful. Contingency awareness implies only that an effect is cognitively mediated, whereas demand awareness im- plies artifact. These issues are empirically tractable and warrant consideration in assessing the efficacy of Pav- lovian procedures for shaping attitudes. EXPERIMENT 1 Experiment I was developed to test Pavlovian pro- cedure in the attitude-formation context; it features ex- plicit assessment of contingency versus demand aware- ness. In addition, an experimental disguise was developed to legitimize the repetitive CS/US exposures. Pavlovian Prescriptions The procedure follows guidelines provided by Mc- Sweeney and Bierley (1984). To promote conditioning, a salient CS and a strong US were used (see McSweeney and Bierley 1984, p. 626). Subjects played a comput- erized word game. Its focal point was five Norwegian words. Pretesting was used to select words that were evaluatively neutral; as the object of the game, these words (i.e., the CSs) were highly salient. Players did not realize that their success rates had been preprogrammed; each Norwegian word was paired with different winning schedules. For example, one CS al- ways predicted a successful outcome (i.e., the US). A win was communicated by such phrases as "excellent," "well done," and "nice job." This approach created a strong US in that certain CSs predicted other words that not only represented a common pool of positive evalu- ative meaning (d la Staats and Staats), but also held the potential of evoking pleasant affect associated with win- ning (Isen et al. 1978). By Allen and Madden's (1985) distinction, the US thus could effect both the "transfer- ence of evaluative meaning" (p. 302) and "direct affect transfer" (p. 303). Proper conditioning procedure also entails careful at- tention to the format and number of CS/US pairings. As McSweeney and Bierley (1984, p. 623) state, ". . . the CS must predict the US for classical conditioning to be effective. The better the CS predicts the US, the better the conditioning will be." Use of the computer game fa- cilitated establishment of the proper predictive relation- ship.2 The strength of the conditioned response also may be affected by the number of CS/US pairings (Mc- Sweeney and Bierley 1984). Ten repetitions were built into the game. This level was chosen on the basis of related work in which 10 or fewer trials yielded sub- 2Proper temporal arrangement of CS and US appears crucial for producing conditioned learning. Generally, a simple simultaneous presentation of CS and US, or a backward presentation (i.e., where the CS follows the US), does not produce conditioning (cf. Mc- Sweeney and Bierley 1984; Schwartz 1978).</page><page sequence="5">34 JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1989 stantial effects (Burgess and Sales 1971; Staats and Staats 1959). Experimental Disguise Conditioning studies often involve procedures that give subjects no realistic sense of purpose; in such instances, elements of the procedure may serve as clues for dis- cerning the study's objectives. To inhibit this propensity to hypothesis-guess, an experimental guise was created. In recruiting, the project was described as pertaining to the use of foreign words as brand names. Concerns were presented about a problem in which, after repeated exposure to foreign brand names, consumers begin to form brand evaluations with no true usage experience. Our goal was described as an attempt to identify the kinds of foreign words that are particularly susceptible to spu- rious meaning development. Experimental Design The study was designed with a two-component treat- ment condition and a control group. In the treatment, two counterbalanced "winning schedules" were used to guard against spurious word effects. As shown in the following tabulation, subjects in component A always got the "correct answer" for the word Nedpa, but never were "correct" when Rykke was the focal word. This schedule was reversed in component B. Winning Rates in the Treatment Condition (%) Word Component A Component B Nedpa 100 0 Glatt 80 20 Igjen 50 50 Trygg 20 80 Rykke 0 100 Treatment subjects were informed of a "correct re- sponse" by positive evaluative phrases. For an "incor- rect response" no feedback was given. Control group members experienced the same game sequence as those in the treatment, but received no "correctness" feed- back. Sixty-one people were recruited via cash lottery from first-year MBA courses. Twenty-one were run in each component of the treatment condition and 19 were pro- cessed as controls. More persons were processed in the treatment group because of the anticipated shrinkage in cell sizes that occurs in post hoc awareness analysis. Procedure Subjects were processed by means of Zenith 150 per- sonal computers placed in each of four rooms. Upon ar- rival the subject was greeted by an experimenter who led him or her to a randomly assigned room. The subject was informed that the study would be conducted via per- sonal computer and was instructed to press any letter to begin. The experimenter then left the room and closed the door. The computer presented this introduction. A Study on the Development of Spurious Meaning Inherent in the Use of Foreign Brand Names The study you are about to participate in concerns the issue of whether spurious meaning-development is a problem when utilizing foreign words for brand names. That is, do consumers begin to attach or as- sociate meaning to foreign words when they are ex- posed to them frequently, even though they have no actual knowledge or experience with the brand in question? To allow us to examine this issue, we would like you to play a computer game. The game is merely a device that allows us to expose you to several dif- ferent Norwegian words. To simulate the market- place phenomenon of repeated exposure, each of these Norwegian words will be the focus of the game on numerous occasions. After playing the game you will be asked a series of questions about each word. Subjects then were taught the game. Each play began with a three-second presentation of 12 letters. After this string disappeared from the screen, a five-letter Nor- wegian word appeared. The subjects' task was to press the "y" key if they thought the Norwegian word could be spelled with letters from the string or "n" if they thought not. In fact, the speed of the game had been calibrated in pilot work to make this task virtually impossible-the letter strings came and went too rapidly. Though play- ers' answers in no way influenced their winning rates, the program did record the plays. Subjects' responses were used to check the assumption that the game's pace would not allow mastery of the task. The computer taught participants by using one, and then four, practice trials. Subjects were taught to re- spond quickly with their first inclination. The game then began and consisted of 50 plays-l10 for each word. When a win was scheduled, the subject's response was fol- lowed by an evaluative phrase. The Norwegian word (the CS) and this positive phrase (the US) then were dis- played together for five seconds. After 50 plays several measures were taken by the computer. First, subjects gave an attitudinal evaluation for each word. Next, they responded to a mood index. Last, they rated the appropriateness of each word as a possible brand name for a new men's cologne. Subjects then were instructed to find an experimenter and were taken to another private room where a postexperimental inquiry (PEI) instrument was completed. After the PEI, a card was filled out for the lottery and participants were asked not to talk about the experiment with their class- mates. All subjects were eventually debriefed in class. Measurement For each measure, 7-point scale items were displayed one at a time on subjects' screens. Word evaluations were derived via a semantic differential; endpoints were good/ bad, positive/negative, unpleasant/pleasant, and like- able/unlikeable. Coefficient alpha for this scale is .87. The mood scale also consisted of four items. Subjects were prompted with the phrase "at this moment I am</page><page sequence="6">ASSESSING THE ROLE OF CONTINGENCY AWARENESS 35 feeling" and responded on items with endpoints good/ bad, unpleasant/pleasant, happy/sad, and negative/ positive. Coefficient alpha is .72. Ratings of each word as a cologne brand name involved a semantic differential with appropriate/inappropriate, undesirable/desirable, and fitting/not fitting as endpoints; alpha is .86. The PEI (see Appendix) served two purposes. It was designed to detect suspicions about the preprogrammed winning schedules and it gauged contingency and de- mand awareness. Questions 1 and 2 were used to assess whether the experimental guise had been accepted. Question 3 was asked to determine whether subjects de- tected that the computer was providing inaccurate feed- back. Questions 4 and 5 checked the credibility of, and familiarity with, the Norwegian words. Questions 6 and 7 gauged general contingency awareness and asked for an indication of when it occurred. Questions 8 and 9 were critical tests of contingency awareness and 10 as- sessed demand awareness. Results for the Conditioning Manipulation Two assumptions were made that could have impli- cations for interpreting observed effects. First, we as- sumed that individuals would not master the game. Re- sponses were analyzed and chi square tests showed that four players performed at a better-than-chance level. Of these, just one indicated suspicion on question 3 of the PEI. Generally, the pace of the game prevented mastery and suspicion. The second assumption was that the moods of the con- trol and treatment groups would be equivalent when key dependent measures were taken. Subtle differences in feeling states may act as a confound in the interpretation of conditioning effects (Allen and Madden 1985). How- ever, the mood measure indicated no difference between treatment and control subjects (t(59) = .2). Two analyses were used in assessing conditioning ef- fects. Between-group tests compared treatment means with control group means. The two components of the treat- ment group were collapsed and tested against the con- trol's averaged evaluation for the corresponding pair of words. That is, treatment group subjects' evaluations for words that always predicted a win (Nedpa or Rykke) were compared with the averaged evaluation of these two words for control subjects. Within-group tests compared sub- jects' evaluations for words they always won with and those they never got correct. The two tests yielded comparable results. For the word evaluations, between-group (X(100%) = 18.76, X(control) = 15.85; t(59) = 3.11,p &lt; .003, w2 = .15) and within- group tests (X(100%) = 18.76, X(0%) = 14.98; t(41) = 4.08, p &lt; .001, o2 = .27) are significant statistically. Higher means indicate more favorable evaluation-thus conditioning appears to have occurred. Similar analyses were performed on ratings of the words as brand names for a cologne. Significant effects are not found in either the between-group (X(100%) = 11.1, X(control) = 10.29; t(59) = .62, p &gt; .50) or within-group (X(100%) = 11.1, X(0%) = 9.74; t(41) = 1.34, p &gt; .18) tests. Post Hoc Awareness Analysis Following the tradition in attitudinal conditioning studies (e.g., Page 1969), we assessed the association between awareness categories and observed effects. As the within- and between-group tests again yielded redundant find- ings, just the between-group results are discussed. PEI responses were used in classifying treatment group subjects into one of three categories: (1) unaware, (2) contingency but not demand aware, or (3) contingency and demand aware. Three judges (not the authors) made the classifications. To be classified contingency aware, subjects had to answer "yes" on question 6 (see Appen- dix), state on question 7 that they noticed as they played that some words were easier, and report in question 8 the CS that always predicted a win. Twenty-two subjects were classified unaware and 20 were classified contin- gency aware. Contingency-aware participants also were examined for demand awareness. To be classified de- mand aware these subjects had to respond "yes" on question 10 and demonstrate in either question 1, 2, or 10 that they had some sense of the experimental hy- pothesis and had acted to confirm it. Six participants were classified demand aware.3 Overall interjudge reliability was .88: disagreements were broken by majority rule. The between-group tests entailed comparisons of word- evaluation means in each awareness category against the control value. For unaware subjects, the test proved non- significant (X(100%) = 17.69, X(control) = 15.85; t(39) = 1.54, p &gt; .10). However, tests involving the contin- gency-aware (X(100%) = 19.22, X(control) = 15.85; t(31) = 2.40, p &lt; .025, w2 = .13) and demand-aware ((1000%) = 21.67, X(control) = 15.85; t(23) = 3.39, p &lt; .003, W2 = .34) groups are significant. Discussion The word-evaluation results uphold the efficacy of ba- sic Pavlovian procedures in shaping attitude. Two em- pirically based arguments can be offered to refute a de- mand artifact interpretation. One involves the PEI data. A small group of subjects saw through the experimental guise and "supported" the conditioning hypothesis. However, when their responses were removed from the analysis, evidence remained for conditioning among those who were contingency but not demand aware. The second argument entails a comparison of results for the two dependent measures-word evaluations ver- sus brand-name ratings. If artifact were the sole factor driving participants' responses, its impact should be uni- 3Because judges were asked to look for an indication that the sub- ject had recognized and acted to confirm the expeiimental hypothesis, one could argue that this group is something more than simply de- mand aware. They guessed the hypothesis and also adopted what Sawyer (1975) refers to as the "good subject" role in their effort to confirm it.</page><page sequence="7">36 JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1989 form across dependent measures. That is, it seems un- likely that upon guessing the experimental hypothesis a subject would decide to support it on one dependent measure but not the other. The fact that the conditioning procedure affected word evaluations, but not brand name ratings, seems to rule out the possibility that the findings merely reflect a global "yes-saying" response. Among subjects classified unaware, a statistically sig- nificant effect is not observed; on the surface, this find- ing appears to corroborate Bandura's (1974, p. 859) con- tention that "people do not learn despite repetitive paired experiences unless they recognize that events are cor- related." However, though Bandura implies that contin- gency awareness has a causal role in conditioned learn- ing, this post hoc analysis supports only an associative inference. One could argue that the data merely illustrate an epiphenomenon that accompanies noncognitive con- ditioning (cf. Staats 1969). Indeed, as Page (1974, p. 476) concludes, ". . . postexperimental questionnaire data taken alone should not ordinarily be used in a strong argument. However ... postexperimental data can be very helpful in suggesting . . . hypotheses for experi- mental manipulations." Following Page's suggestion, we designed a second study to supply more information about the causal role of contingency awareness in condition- ing. EXPERIMENT 2 Experiment 2 again employed the computerized word game, but with three new manipulations. One of them was an attempt to strengthen the conditioning procedure used in experiment 1 without increasing contingency or demand awareness. The second was an attempt to heighten contingency but not demand awareness and the third ma- nipulated demand awareness. Experimental Manipulations The first manipulation was chosen to provide a "bet- ter" opportunity for noncognitive conditioning to occur. Recall that results of the post hoc analysis are nonsig- nificant for the unaware group (X(100%) = 17.69, X(control) = 15.85; t(39) = 1.54, p &gt; .10), but the di- rection of the means is consistent with the conditioning hypothesis. Increasing the potency of the procedure without raising awareness levels would furnish an in- teresting test of the conditioning-without-awareness po- sition. One obvious approach for strengthening the procedure is to add repetitions, but it poses the repetitions di- lemma-as repetitions increase, so may contingency and demand awareness. To strengthen the manipulation, we followed McSweeney and Bierley's (1984, p. 626) sug- gestion that "conditioning will also be better . . . for longer intertrial intervals." This interval is simply the time between successive CS/US pairings. In the new manipulation the average intertrial interval was doubled by adding 50 dummy plays-one between each original play. These plays involved five additional Norwegian words; subjects received "correct" feedback for the dummy words 50% of the time. The other two manipulations did not involve altera- tions in the original game-changes came through in- structions to subjects. To assess the causal impact of contingency awareness, instructions were used to pro- mote learning of the CS/US contingency. These instruc- tions were also designed to suppress demand awareness by leading participants to anticipate that some words would be easier to get correct than others. The logic was that a priori legitimization of the differential winning rates would further reduce suspicions about them and inhibit hypothesis-guessing. The third manipulation employed instructions designed to heighten demand awareness. The experimental hypothesis was communicated to subjects before they played the game. Subjects and Design Experiment 2 was conducted three months after ex- periment 1; second-year MBAs were recruited. Seventy- eight subjects were processed, with 26 assigned ran- domly to each condition. Because the within- and be- tween-group tests in experiment 1 yielded comparable results, a control group was deemed unnecessary. Procedure and Measurement Subjects were run with the same facilities and pro- cedures used previously. The extended intertrial interval manipulation was created by inserting 10 presentations for five additional words. The contingency-aware manipulation involved new in- structions; the following paragraph was inserted in the game's introduction. In our attempt to determine the reasons for spu- rious meaning-development, we have found differ- ent words are more or less troublesome for different people. Our experience indicates that some words will be easier than others to get correct in the game you will play. We have found the words that are easiest and hardest to get correct vary by individual. As you play, try to keep track of the words that prove especially easy or difficult for you. We will ask you to tell us which words you found easiest and hardest after the experiment is completed. Just before beginning play subjects were again reminded to note words that were especially easy or difficult for them. For the demand-aware condition, the following paragraph was inserted in the introduction. In our attempt to determine the reasons for spurious meaning-development, we have found different words are more or less troublesome for different people in the game you will play. We have also found that the words people consistently perform better on are the words that they rate more positively (and vice versa with difficult words). Do not be concerned if you find your ratings are influenced by the ease or difficulty of getting a word correct. It is a common experience we have come to</page><page sequence="8">ASSESSING THE ROLE OF CONTINGENCY AWARENESS 37 expect as a result of using this game to investigate spu- rious meaning-development. Before starting play, subjects were reminded that they would develop an evaluation bias attributable to their success rates. The mood scale was dropped; otherwise, all measures were identical to those used before. Word evaluations and brand name ratings were collected for the same words used in experiment 1; alphas for these scales are .89 and .86. The session again ended with the PEI (see Appen- dix). Results As in experiment 1, we assumed that the game's pace would prevent mastery. Analysis of individuals' plays showed that only one person performed at a better-than- chance level. The assumption that participants did not become suspicious of the preprogrammed winning schedule again appears reasonable. Though the thrust of experiment 2 was to avoid the ambiguities inherent in post hoc analyses, the PEI data have value as a manipulation check. With one exception, subjects were classified as unaware, contingency aware, or demand aware by the same criteria as before. The exception was the demand-aware classification for the demand awareness treatment. This group was told the research hypothesis before they played; thus, if they oth- erwise satisfied all requirements for contingency aware- ness, they were presumed to be demand aware. Results of the awareness classification by treatment group are reported in Table 1. Within-group tests were examined for word evalua- tions and brand name ratings.4 In the extended intertrial interval group there are no effects on word evaluations (X(100%) = 18.57, X(0%) = 18.32; t(25) = .17, p &gt; 4The results of experiment 1 and conditioning theory both predict a unidirectional hypothesis for experiment 2: the procedure should yield more favorable evaluations for those words always associated with a win. Because of this unidirectional hypothesis, one-tailed sig- nificance tests are reported.

In the contingency- aware treatment there is an effect on word evaluations (X(100%) = 18.30, X(0%) = 15.35; t(25) = 1.89, p &lt; .05, w2 = .09), but not on brand name ratings (X(100%) = 12.50, X(0%) = 12.27; t(25) = .18, p &gt; .80). In the demand-aware condition significant effects are found for both word evaluations (X(100%) = 18.85, X(0%) = 15.89; t(25) = 2.43, p &lt; .02, w2 = .14) and brand name ratings (X(100%) = 12.20, X(0%) = 9.77; t(25) = 1.90, p &lt; .05, 02 = .09). Discussion The data do not corroborate the view that conditioned learning comes about through a noncognitive process. A manipulation chosen to strengthen the procedure without increasing awareness levels yielded no learning Con- versely, the manipulation designed to promote contin- gency learning in conjunction with the conditioning pro- cedure did produce a statistically significant effect. Two arguments can be offered to refute demand ar- tifact interpretations for the contingency-aware condi- tion. First, notice in Table 1 that the number of subjects who became demand aware in this condition is low and equals the number in the extended intertrial interval con- dition. Demand awareness thus does not offer a rival ex- planation for the difference in word evaluations between these groups. Second, as argued previously, if artifacts were re- sponsible for the observed effects one would expect ef- fects on both word evaluations and brand name ratings. This outcome is demonstrated in the demand-aware con- dition where significant effects are documented on both measures. Because statistical significance is found on just the word evaluations in the contingency-aware condi- tion, this effect seems unlikely to be merely a global "yes-saying" response. GENERAL DISCUSSION Our project furnishes no evidence for the condition- ing-without-awareness position. In experiment 1, the ob- served effect is not present among subjects classified un- aware. In experiment 2, the manipulation designed to strengthen the conditioning procedure that had been used in experiment 1, though inhibiting increases in aware- ness, yielded no effect. Arguing that nonsignificant re- sults support anything is problematic, and we do not contend or imply that this lack of significance disproves noncognitive conditioning. Like other researchers (e.g., Bandura 1974; Dawson 1973; Dawson et al. 1982; Grings 1973; Hall 1976; Hare 1964; Insko and Oakes 1966; Page 1969, 1974; Perruchet 1985; Rozelle 1968), we suggest that it is difficult to demonstrate conditioning without awareness. If research on subliminal perception provides any guide (e.g., Holender 1986; Merikle and Cheesman 1987), there is reason to believe that studying "pre- conscious," "automatic," or otherwise "noncognitive" processes will remain perplexing.</page><page sequence="9">38 JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1989 Our data demonstrate an association between contin- gency awareness and attitudinal conditioning. In exper- iment 1, the significant effect held among subjects clas- sified contingency aware. In experiment 2, instructions that fostered contingency learning as part of the proce- dure yielded a significant effect. These findings are con- sistent with research indicating that contingency learning does have a causal role in conditioning (e.g., Dawson 1973; Dawson et al. 1982; Grings 1973; Hall 1976). Ascribing causality to contingency learning mani- fested as conscious awareness of the CS/US pairing pat- tern invites a view of classical conditioning as a cogni- tively mediated process. However, we do not suggest that conditioning entails careful or deliberative thought processes; to the contrary, though conditioning proce- dures may begin to affect individuals' attitudes only after they have learned the CS/US contingency, this fact need not imply that they are aware of the effect. As Nisbett and Wilson (1977, p. 247) note, ". . . even when peo- ple are cognizant of the existence of both stimulus and response, they appear to be unable to report correctly about the effect of the stimulus on the response." Though attitudinal conditioning appears cognitively mediated, automatism remains in the sense that individuals may not be cognizant of how stimulus pairings they (knowingly) encounter influence their attitudes. The findings also make a rather clear point about de- mand artifact. Some subjects are likely to guess the ex- perimental hypothesis in conditioning studies, even when explicit steps have been taken to disguise the research purpose. Ignoring demand-aware subjects will increase the likelihood that one's data will "support" a condi- tioning hypothesis. THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS Our project supports the salience of contingency learn- ing in attitudinal conditioning, but many adjustments for strengthening the procedures used here might be tested (McSweeney and Bierley 1984). Perhaps a stronger pro- cedure would reveal a noncognitive mechanism. We em- phasize, however, that ours is not the first project to im- plicate contingency awareness as a requisite for conditioned learning (cf. Baer and Fuhrer 1982; Biferno and Dawson 1977; Dawson et al. 1982; Grings 1973; Rescorla 1988). Indeed, we concur with Dawson (1973, p. 85) that a construct like contingency awareness "must be incorporated into any complete conditioning theory." Moreover, a case can be made that contingency aware- ness will be germane to theory building for applied set- tings if it is treated as a hypothetical construct. This case requires a conceptualization of classical conditioning as a cognitive, sequence-learning process (cf. Bandura 1974; Dawson et al. 1982; Perruchet 1985; Tolman 1932; Woodworth 1958). Tolman (1932) was probably the first psychologist to portray classical conditioning as a sequence-learning process. He contended that Pavlov's dogs acquired an "expectation to the effect that waiting in the presence of the sign-object-color or sound-would lead to the sig- nificate-food" (p. 331). In this process the CS is viewed as arousing an orienting reflex that produces anticipation about "what's next" (Perruchet 1985; Woodworth 1958). With repetition, the US becomes the answer to this im- plicit question (Dawson et al. 1982). Thus, in successful conditioning, the CS creates an expectation that leads the subject to anticipate and predict the US. For the human subject, this learned relationship may achieve accessi- bility at a conscious level that is manifested as contin- gency awareness (Dawson et al. 1982). Forming theoretical terms (such as "contingency awareness") as hypothetical constructs has advantages. As summarized by Zuriff (1985, p. 78), ". . . hypo- thetical constructs facilitate theoretical reduction, they provide more satisfactory understanding, and they are heuristically fertile." Such advantages are apparent when classical conditioning is conceived as sequence learning that yields contingency awareness. For example, many Pavlovian laws can be interpreted as compatible with this conceptualization. McSweeney and Bierley's (1984, p. 623) conclusion that "the better the CS predicts . . the better conditioning will be" might be rephrased as "the better the CS predicts, the faster the sequential learning process will transpire to produce contingency aware- ness." Empirical arrangements of the CS and US that yield "overshadowing" or "blocking" (McSweeney and Bierley 1984; Schwartz 1978) and disrupt conditioning might be interpreted as involving CS/US arrangements that confound sequence learning. Hence, contingency awareness seems useful as a theoretical abstraction that enhances understanding of Pavlovian laws. Theoretical abstractions are valuable to practitioners because they supply understanding that can be translated into diverse contexts (Calder, Phillips, and Tybout 1981). Our project demonstrates that structuring the presenta- tion of a neutral stimulus with a positively evaluated stimulus can affect individuals' attitudes. It is not dif- ficult to extrapolate this attitude-formation mechanism into an advertising domain; furthermore, illustrating the heuristic fertility of the contingency awareness construct for advertising applications is straightforward. Before discussing these application issues, we address the lim- itations of the research. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS All research designs involve validity tradeoffs; inter- nal validity was the principal priority in designing our two experiments. Heavy emphasis on internal validity typically comes at the expense of ecological validity. In this section we specifically discuss how the tasks sub- jects performed in the studies might differ from ad pro- cessing in natural settings. First, however, we comment on why internal validity was given priority. To understand our design priorities it is useful to con- sider the following question about the marketing field's treatment of attitudinal conditioning: Why has a field that has invested such substantial resources in studying atti-</page><page sequence="10">ASSESSING THE ROLE OF CONTINGENCY AWARENESS 39 tude formation ignored extant research on attitudinal conditioning? Even the latest generation of consumer be- havior texts (e.g., Engel, Blackwell, and Miniard 1986; Peter and Olson 1987) continue to feature Pavlov's ex- periments with salivating dogs while ignoring research on the conditioning of attitude. Though there may be many reasons for this indifference, a major one certainly is related to how attitude conditioning has fared among social psychologists. Internal validity problems with the Staatses' (1957, 1958, 1959) seminal experiments led influential authors (e.g., Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, p. 277-80) to favor Page's (1969, 1974) demand artifact interpretation. The demand artifact issue effectively sti- fled research on attitudinal conditioning in social psy- chology, and possibly in marketing as well. Without a careful treatment of the artifact question, we saw little chance that the marketing field would reconsider its in- herited disinterest in the conditioning of attitude. Hence, concern about demand artifact motivates the priority on internal validity (Calder, Phillips, and Tybout 1981; Sawyer 1975). The computer game was developed as a means for un- obtrusively administering a conditioning procedure. The game facilitates structuring the arrangement between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli without giving participants the impression that this arrangement was predetermined or controlled. Attitudinal conditioning oc- curred as an incidental byproduct of task performance, as it might occur as a result of incidental exposures to television advertisements. However, major differences between the computer game task and naturalistic ad-pro- cessing situations preclude direct generalizations. One could argue that this artificial task was biased toward production of conditioned learning; conversely, one might contend that it was an impoverished procedure with nothing close to the potential potency of an advertising campaign. Let us examine both of these positions. Several procedural features could have produced learning levels that would be unique to the project. The CSs were selected to be unfamiliar and neutral attitude objects-an ideal situation for shaping attitudes. Brand attitudes for parity products in uninvolving categories can be labile; however, even weakly developed brand atti- tudes are likely to be more difficult to influence than attitudes toward unfamiliar words. In addition, as the centerpiece of the game, the Norwegian words should have been a continual focal point of players' attention. Though attention levels may have fluctuated over the course of the game, one still would suspect that brand names are never accorded such consistent attention in mass-media advertising. Our neutral, highly salient CSs certainly facilitated conditioning and using MBAs as game players also may have contributed. MBA students are likely to be more competitive and have greater cognitive skills than the general population. If so, contingency learning might be expected to occur more rapidly in a sample of MBAs than in the population at large. If con- tingency learning is a prerequisite for conditioning, the use of MBAs may have inflated the observed effects. In contrast, one might view the laboratory procedure as impotent in comparison with the possibilities offered by television advertising. Advertisers can use powerful imagery and combine it with compelling music to create unconditioned stimuli that would be substantially more evocative than the evaluative feedback used as the US in our experiments. Additionally, over the course of a campaign, advertisers may benefit from repetition levels that far exceed the 10 CS/US exposures we used. Stronger USs combined with prodigious repetition levels admin- istered over time contribute to the relative potency of advertising as a natural conditioning mechanism. The differences between this laboratory setting and real ad exposure environments are substantial; caution is ap- propriate in drawing conclusions for marketing practice. However, our data do indicate that contingency learning may have an important role in attitudinal conditioning. In the next sections we illustrate the potential value of the contingency awareness construct in advertising ap- plications and suggest directions for further research fea- turing this construct. ADVERTISING APPLICATIONS We examine a basic mechanism for shaping attitudes that may be operative in advertising contexts and extend prior theorizing by introducing the contingency aware- ness construct as salient for such contexts. This construct furnishes a simplifying focal point for ad construction. Rather than trying to interpret and accommodate a va- riety of Pavlovian laws, the advertiser can concentrate on effecting contingency learning when building ads with an intent to affect brand attitudes. In general, proper conditioning mechanics should involve repeated presen- tation of the brand (i.e., the CS) to stimulate anticipa- tion. Via a repetitive sequential arrangement, the viewer should be taught to expect the US (e.g., an attractive visual image) after each CS presentation. The learning of this relationship should increase the likelihood of at- titude formation. An anecdotal example may help clarify this notion of "proper conditioning mechanics." Strong Versus Weak Conditioning Mechanics Two 1983 Clio Award-winning commercials are de- scribed as illustrations:5 a 30-second ad for Diet Pepsi that demonstrates strong conditioning mechanics and a 60-second ad for Calvin Klein Activewear that does not. Diet Pepsi. This commercial features a repetitive mu- sical jingle with a series of brief visual clips. The jingle lyrics-"Now you see it, now you don't, here you have it, here you won't"-are precisely coordinated with the image presentation. The ad contains four conditioning 5We have no way of knowing the advertisers' actual communication objectives for either of these ads and are not contending that one ad was more effective than the other. Thete ads were selected merely to illustrate that it is realistic to discuss implementation of "proper versus improper" conditioning mechanics in traditional advertising contexts.</page><page sequence="11">40 JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH, FEBRUARY 1989 trials where the CS (the brand) predicts the US (a slim female torso). In each instance "Now you see it, now you don't" is sung as first the brand (CS) and then a trim-figured woman (US) is shown. Hence, the CS pre- dicts the US and the jingle lyrics teach the viewer to anticipate the US after each CS. Using the jingle in this way fosters the anticipation and prediction that are cen- tral to the sequence-learning view of conditioning. It is easy to iniagine that many viewers of this ad would have consciously recognized a CS/US pairing pattemrn-sim- ply stated, they would have become contingency aware. Calvin Klein Activewear. Like the Diet Pepsi ad, this award winner appeals to the virtues of a trim figure. It is built around a series of closeups of a woman exercis- ing and then changing into street clothes. The product category and brand name are mentioned only at the end. The ad is novel but does not use a structured, sequential relationship between CS and US. In fact, it is difficult to say what the US would be. Typically, this "mini- drama" ad style-which often is used as a means for delivering emotional appeals-does not include CS/US sequencing that would promote contingency learning. Fostering Contingency Learning in Television Advertisements Creating proper CS/US arrangements in 30-second television commercials can be straightforward. Short clips of visual imagery that are evaluatively positive and/or emotionally evocative furnish basic building blocks (cf. Stuart, Shimp, and Engle 1987) for constructing ads with sound conditioning mechanics. As USs, these images should effect the "transference of evalutive meaning" and/ or "direct affect transfer" that are the core of attitudinal conditioning (Allen and Madden 1985). Treating contin- gency learning as a requisite in the process implies that an ad should lead the viewer to expect and predict a very specific image or set of images after each brand presen- tation. The implication of a noncognitive conditioning pro- cess is that one need merely to expose the viewer to a series of CS/US pairings for attitudes to be affected. Conversely, if contingency awareness is necessary, tele- vision commercials adopting a conditioning format should include tactics designed to focus attention on the CS/US arrangement to promote recognition of the pairing pat- tern. Generally, attention is presumed to be ephemeral (e.g., Kahneman 1973) and in real-world ad-exposure contexts capricious attention seems a given. Using non- verbal cues, voice-overs, and/or background music in an effort to fluctuate and direct attention during ad view- ing could foster contingency learning and, presumably, affect brand attitude. Research on how message tactics are used to activate and direct attention at specific instances in an ad pro- vides some suggestions for building ads that promote contingency learning. For instance, alterations in the vi- sual imagery (via zooms, pans, or slow motion), actor movements and facial expressions, and auditory fluctua- tions (e.g., start of voice-over, pace changes in the voice- over, changes in pitch or tempo of the background mu- sic) have all been linked to shifts in arousal during ad processing (cf. Alwitt 1985; Haley, Richardson, and Baldwin 1984; Reeves et al. 1985). In general, each of these tactics has the potential to disrupt information flow. Such variations in the continuity of the presentation often yield an orienting response that directs attention to the stimulus. Using such tactics to direct attention to the CS/ US pairings may activate the minimal cognitive re- sources required for contingency learning. Ad Evaluation and Contingency Awareness One appropriate application of conditioning proce- dures appears to be in shaping brand attitudes for un- involving, parity products (Gorn 1982; Shimp 1981). In this context contingency awareness gives the advertiser an intermediate goal that may have further value as a focus in the ad evaluation process. For example, copy tests could be developed to assess the relative effective- ness of rough versions of commercials for producing contingency awareness. Note that contingency aware- ness was gauged in our project with a simple recall mea- sure. In ad testing, subjects might be asked to recall the images they remember being associated with the brand name in a specific ad execution. We speculate that the most informative procedures would try to assess recall of those very specific images employed in the execution. However, such a task could prove very demanding if individuals were asked to verbalize recollections of fleet- ing, rapidly paced image sequences. The recognition measure advocated by Singh, Rothschild, and Churchill (1988) may be better suited to gauging contingency learning when nonverbal ad cues serve as the USs. DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH In recent years, several authors have discussed general implications of the conditioning framework for advertis- ing research (Allen and Madden 1985; McSweeney and Bierley 1984; Stuart, Shimp, and Engle 1987). In this concluding section we focus more specifically on the contingency awareness construct and its research impli- cations. As Calder, Phillips, and Tybout (1981, p. 198) have observed, ". . . theories [do not] specify how their abstract constructs can be embodied in real-world inter- ventions." Thus, conclusive recommendations about what advertising tactics will be most effective for enhancing contingency learning must await a research stream de- veloped around the intervention-testing agenda. Such a stream should place higher priority on ecological validity without totally ignoring the demand artifact issues that have confounded inferences in some prior work. The challenge for future research is communicated best with a reference to experiment 2. In that study instruc- tions designed to promote contingency learning were given to some subjects-the procedure influenced those sub- jects' attitudes about the CS. Advertisers obviously can- not give consumers instructions to promote contingency</page><page sequence="12">ASSESSING THE ROLE OF CONTINGENCY AWARENESS 41 awareness, but diverse message tactics designed to ac- tivate and focus attention at key points in the ad could be tested as real-world interventions. Empirical research should be helpful in deciding which message structures and what execution tactics are most effective in produc- ing contingency awareness. Also, the structure or tactic used in an ad may gain or lose potency with multiple exposures to that ad. Thus, important issues pertaining to the effects of repetition could be incorporated into this research stream. A productive experimental paradigm for this interven- tion testing might be developed by extending the pro- cedures used in Stuart, Shimp, and Engle's (1987) recent project. Stuart and her colleagues used a procedure fea- turing fictitious brands as CSs and pleasant natural scenes as USs. Proper CS/US sequences were arranged via a meticulous color-slide presentation; this approach proved effective in shaping subjects' attitudes. Adopting this sort of imagery presentation for use with VCR equipment would be straightforward and provide several advan- tages. The VCR format would not only allow for sound generalizations to television-advertising applications, but also furnish the precise control one needs in creating and testing alternative CS/US arrangements. Additionally, the VCR format could facilitate testing of different tac- tics for accelerating contingency learning. For example, background music, voice-overs, pace changes, camera movements, timing of CS/US pairings, number of CS/ US pairings, extraneous imagery, and a variety of other executional variables could be assessed as interventions for effecting contingency awareness. Incorporating the contingency awareness construct into an attitudinal conditioning framework motivates a vari- ety of empirical questions. This set of questions differs from those typically studied by marketing researchers in that they converge on issues involving the mechanics of ad construction. Research in the seam between cogni- tivism and behaviorism offers a unique agenda for knowledge development that could yield important, pragmatic insights.
