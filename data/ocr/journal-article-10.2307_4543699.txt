IN the iuniavoidable absence of our President, Professor Stout, an absciice which we all regret, the duty has devolved upon me of delivering the customary address at the opening meeting of the present session of the Society. As I have had but a short tinme for preparing it, I mulst thlrow myself upon your kin(d indulgence to make allowance for any defects of argumentative elaborationi which nmay be only too apparent as I proceed. I shall, however, confine myself, so far as possible, to general considerationis as to the niature, scope, and method of philosoplhy, and its present positioni and prospects in this couintry. Anid first as to the field before it. Theie are two very different senses in whiclh the term common sense is intended and applied. In one of them it means a certain degree of intel- ligence, in the other a certain set of ideas and beliefs. In the former sense there is ilnvolved no opposition or antagonism between common sense and philosophy. In the latter there is, because it is just the set of common-sense ideas and beliefs, current at alny period, wlhich it is the task of philosophy to examine, verify, and, if necessary, correct; a task which, I may add, philosophy performs and can perform solely by the applica- tion of common sense itself taken in the foriner meaning of the term. Philosophy is common senise in the former meaningo A</page><page sequence="2">2 9SHADWORTH If. HIODGSON. applied to the examiination, verificationi, and corrcctiuii of common) sense in the latter meaning. You see how large--I had almost said immeasurable-a field is hereby opened to philosophy, a field nieveitheless wvhic-2h it is bound, so far as in it lies, to measure and reclaimi. For supposing that any idea or belief of comiimon sense slhouil(l be examined by philosophy, and should be replaced by souine new idea or belief, which in its turn becomes currenit, aind wins general acceptance, at once the question arises, to wlielh of the two, pliilosophy or common sense, does this new idea or belief belong-is it to philosophy, in virtue of its being (duie to phlilosophical criticisxi, or is it to comilmoln sense, in virtue of its having taken its place amona generally accepted truths? It is aroucd i(leas and beliefs belonging to this class that the great philosophical controversies in reality rage; suichl ideas and beliefs, for instatnce, as are expressed by the terms SubstLance, Power, Agrent, Agency. And I cannot but think that aii end will only then be found to such controversies, when somiie clear lirne of distinction shall have been drawn, between the essential characteristics of a philosophical idea or belief on the one hand and those of a comnmion-sense idea or belief on the other. Alnd more thani this. I thiiik that this lhoped- for line of distinction must be itself of such a nature as to assure a certain validity to ideas ancd beliefs of botlh classes, within the class to which they are respectively recognised as belonging. I mean that, if and when philosophical theory and analysis fail, if and when they lead to the establishment of the existence of some reality, the nature anid mode of operation of which human consciousness has no mneans of ascertainiing, there and then we of necessity fall back upon some commnion-sense i(leas of that reality, ideas which for iiail have practical validity, as guides to his conception of his own relationi to that reality, but which afford no grounds for a speculative klnowledge or theory of it. And, farther, I am of opinion that the liine of (lislinction spoken of above must be (liscovered by philosophy</page><page sequence="3">'METHOD IN PHILOSOPIHY. 3 in reflecting onl its own scope and method, for that scope anid method it is whiclh constitute it a separate pursuit, and give it the primacy over all other lines of speculative enquiry. Three and twenty years ago, when I had the privilegre of delivering the first Presidential Address from the chair of this Society, at the opening of our Second Session, the poinit on which I most insisted was, that there was, and could not but be, such a separate pursuit, defined provisionally, and in the most general terms, by its end or purpose of attainiing a Rationale qf the Univegse, as mentally visible from a hiuman centre. Well, I think there is no lieed now to insist on this elementary truth. Our continued existence in such a place as London slhows that we as a Society are well convinced of it. The points we have now to keep before us are, what is the true definition of the end of philosophy ? anid what is the true method of attaininig it ?-points within the scope of philosophy itself, points of ardent controversy among its votaries. The prirnacy of philosophy is assured to it by its subjective character, that is, by the fact that coinsciousness, expelience, or knowledge, that is, subjectivity itself, as such, is its object of investigation, and not any object or set of objects assumed to exist, without enquiiry into the modes of consciousness by which that assump- tion is justified. But within this philosophical enquiry there is room for the greatest differences of opinion. These differences of opinion it is which the imieetinigs of this Society afford opportunities of discussing; and while the differences them- selves continiue to exist, long may these mneetings continue. For it is to philosophy that th-ie decision of the great questions which most deeply initerest hunmanity bllongs, questions falling under thle heads of Ethical, Theological, ?sthetical, Logical, and Psychological, as well as of those speculative questions concerniing the nature of the Universe, including the question whether any speculative solution of theem is possible to human thouight. Some purview of the whole miust be taken, before we can reach ainy satisfactory foundatioln of doctrine concerning A 2</page><page sequence="4">4 SHADWORTII If. IIODGSON. a part, since some coniception of the relationis of that part to the whole and to other parts is a necessary ingredient in that foundation. In casting a glance of retrospect on the year which has just elapsed, we have to lament the loss by death of two muost valued members. Oile of themi, remove(l at a conmparatively early age, Professor D. G. Ritchie, well knowni by his con- tributions to philosophical literature, as wvell as by his teaching in the Chair of Logic and Metaplhysic at St. Andrews, was tlhe valued President of this Society for the year 1898 to 1899. The other, Alexander Bain, a veteranl in age, a veteran in philosophical teaching, a veterani in philosophical literature, who has had as great an influence oln the plilosophical thought of this counltry as any conteinporary writer that cail be named, joined ouir Society in the year 1884, a time when support was very welcome, and gave us the advantage of his miielmbership, sending uis five years' subscriptioni in advance as token of his goodwill. He many times attended our rfreetings and joined in our discussions. At the time of hiis d3eatlh he had for somne years been an honorary member. And here I hope it will not appear ouit of place if I say a word of lament on the loss philosoplhy has recently suff&amp;red in the death of Robert Adamson, Professor of Logic and Rhetoric at Glasgow (February, 1902). Assuredly a vigorous and inde- pendent mind was here at woork on philosophical questioiis. Most fortunate it is that those four courses of Lectures, two on the history of miodern philosophy and two on psychology, extending over two sessions, 1897-1899, at Glasgow, lhave been rescued from oblivion, and made generally accessible, in the two handsome volumes edited by Pirofessor Sorley. There is aniother philosophical veteran, whose loss by death at the age of 88 philosophy has this year to lament, M. Charles Renouvier, whose energies as a plhilosophical writer conitinued up to the close of a very lonlg life with undiminished clearness and vigour. He is perhaps best knowni by his Essais de</page><page sequence="5">MlETHIOD IN l'HIILOSOPIIY. 5 Critique GeJnirale, the first editioni of which in four voluimes extended from 1854 to 1864, and the second, very considerably enlarged, from 1875 to 1896; also by his Science de la Alorale, 1869; by his historical romnance, Uchronie, 1876; and as the founder, in conjunctioni with M. F. Pillon, of a periodical, L'Annde Philosophique, in 1868, succeeded by La Critique Philosophique in 1872.; and as a contributor to the earlier volumes of the new series of L'Annee Philosophique, which succeeded La Critique Ph1ilosophiqce in 1891, under the able editorship of M. Pillon, anid still continues to appear in the shape of an anniual volume of the highest importance and interest, to wlhich M. Pillon himliself is the chief contributor- Renouvier's last work, Le Personmalismie, published this very year, is a singularly able and most instructive exposition of that Neo-criticist theory, founided on Leibniz and Kant, which he had devoted the whole latter part of his life to work out. And the nine or ten preceding years had seen the publication of as many several volunmes on1 philosophical questions trom the same pen. I an1 thankful to be able to ofler, fromi this Chair, my humiible tribuite of honour and admiration to this illustrious Frenclh philosopher, so recently taken from us. But all the more in thinking of our losses it behoves us to rally our' forces, and steadily face the problems of philosophy. .And first as to the nmethod of approachling them, its method being that which is distiictive of any particular system of philosophical thougrht. And lhere I venture to quote a para- graph from mv sixth Address to the Society, delivered in October, 1885, entitled Philosophy and Experience, p. 11, on the function of mnethod. "Metlhod in philosophy," I said, " holds very much the same place that Hypothesis holds in science. Both must be tested by their results. But while results in science are tested by successful anld verified prediction, and there is no prediction in philosophy, a Rationale of the Existent being its aim, the question is, what are the results which, in philosophy, test the value and soundness of the</page><page sequence="6">6 SH)DwOPrTH H. HODGSON. metlhod? They are the removal of all gratuitouis and merely logical puzzles, the lharmlonising of all parts or facts of consciousness, or, what is the same thiDa, of experience, witlh each other, and thereby by degrees obtaining such a systematic Ration-ale of the wlhole, as was contermiplated in iny first Add-ress, and there exhibited as the great purpose of philosophy. Puzzles are introduced into philosophy by makinig tacit and unsuispected assumptions; in contrast tlherebv to the assump- tioins of -science, wllich are hypotheses adopted for some express puirpiose, and with full awareness of their lhypothetical character. The soundness of a method in philosophy con.sists, therefore, in its leading to the suiccessful detectioni and avoidance of uniwitting assumptions." We must, tlhen, I think, go to work in philosophy oni a different basis, a different distinction in thought, from that whiclh governs conmmoln-selnse thiniking, by which latter I miean the distinction between Subject and Object, or Self and Not-self, a distinietion which sbems to suppose some previous or inecessarily involved distiniction to have been drawn between one or other of those pairs which I mentioned at the outset, I mean, Substance and Power, Agent and Agency, or some equivalent distinction; which distinctions are embodied and expressed by the forms of noun and verb conistrued with each other in ordinary language. Not that I would reject any of these distinctions as misrepresentations of the truth; but if theii nature and validity as ultimate distinctionis, lying at the basis of philosophy, are to be examined, it is surely necessary that some distinction in thought should be apparent, on which to ground anld justify our examination. It is as the basis of philosophy, and in that clharacter only, that they are challenged. Tn ordinary language-and no other is at our disposal-we speak, and to that extent also tend to think, in what I miiay call the logic of Substance, that which is expressed by noun or pronoun suibstantive represented in thought as doing or suffering, having or not having, giving or receiving something.</page><page sequence="7">MlETHIIOD IN PHILOSOPhIIY. 7 Abstract indeedl, or evein imagginary, the agelnt or hiis doincg may be; this makes no (tifference to what I lhave called the logic of the thinking-the distinction underlying it is the same. The agent and hiis agrency, the sulbstance and its power, are all allike talken as coimiplete empirical realities. The question 1 now raise is, whetlher they are entitled also to be taiken as the iultimate basis of plhilosoplhy. If we are to test themii, we miust find some distinietion whlich is still more fuindamental, andi wlhicli will hold its ground as an ultilmate distinction. r tlhink there is such a distinction universally discoverable in experience, and uiliversally applicable, so soon as we frankly anid fuilly adopt the suibjective aspect, or our k-nowledge, of thiiwzr.,; as our object-miiatter, and apply it to that, in contra- distinlctionl frorom their objective aspect, or tlingos as they exist. Tlhe (listinctioii is that insisted on by Plato in opposing, ov'o-ta to 7eVe0L,q and by Aristotle in opposing the 7 o'uTt to the 7-s 7rapatverCTa. Briefly we may call it that betweeni the niatuire anid the history of any object thought of so far as it is tlholghllt of, or can be thought of, by us. Let these questionls, first of its lnature, then of its history, be put to the above- name(ld conceptions-Substance, Power, Agent, Agency, Subject, Object, Self, Not-self. What do we know of thc niature and the Ihistory of the objects, as we call them, of these conceptions? Let the attempt be made to conceive thiose s(amne objects fron a different point of view, that is, under the guidance of a diffeient di.stinction, or pair of conceptions. TI)e (listinction of lnature and hiistory is applicable to any content of thlouaht, and divides it exhaustively, being, nothing, btut (1) a transverse section, as it were, of one particular time- thread of consciouisness, anid (2) a longitudinal view of that time-tlhread in coinnection with its collaterals. The distinction itself is found by analysis of every, even the least and sirnlmlest, emiipirical experience, and introduces notlhing what- eveir by assuniption ilnto the content taken for examination, whatever it may be. If any other content is introduced under</page><page sequence="8">8 SHIADWORT}H H. HODGSON. the hiead of hiistory, either from the antecedent parts o4 its own time-tllread, or from the collaterals, the same quiestions mnust be pat to that content, and the samie distirnetioji applied. What the distinction does is thtus to supply a metanis of accurately questioning the conitent of our tlhouglht. Of course this does not mean that it supplies the aniswers to ouir questions, that it gives us a positive know]edge, either of tlhe content examined, or of its hiistory, which we had not before. Obtaining this must depenid on quite other conditions tllail merely- applyingzn a distinction as a method of questioning. At the same time it may reveal blanks in our knowledge which were b)efore unsuspected, or nmay reveal as assumptions or hypotheses what we had previously taken to be data. Wheni this is the case, and for so long as it is the case our only true course is to acknowledge the fact, adimiitting in the case of the blankls that there is sonmething, in existence, the cointent of wlhiel is not positively represeilted in our knowledge, anid olnly retaining, the assumptions or the lhypotheses as aids to our ownl needs in reasoning or in conduct, with full consciousness of this their true character anid office. I't was, in mly opiniion. the funda- mental error of Kant's theory, that in examining experience he reversed the order of these two quiestions; lhe attemiipted to answer the question of its history, or how experienice was possible, before putting the question of its nature, or what it was known as, from which alolne the idea of its possibility, its genesis, its hiistory, could be derived; a reversal whichl compelled the assum?ptioni from commoni-sense sources, tlhotghli without any philosophical warrant, of the existence or a Subject, of some sort or other, capable of experiencing. If we apply this questioning distinctioil to the six iuiost definite of the above list of conceptions, olmitting Object for its generality, and Not-self for its negativity, what we slhall find, I think, concerningb them is, that they fall inito the rankl of the assumptions or the hypotheses just spoken of. They are brief descriptionis, characterisations, designations, of classes and</page><page sequence="9">lIET'IOD IN PI'LOSOPHY. 9 series of facts, wlvich eniable us to deal in thouagt and practice with those facts, buit mlust not be takeni as if they were niames or thoughts corresponding to iminedliate]y given facts tlhemii- selves, eaclh to each. That is, they mlust not be hypostasise(d as entities. Tlley do not supply an explanation of the facts which they sunmmarise. It is a fallacy to regard themn in that light and then to say that they ar'c noincena, or thlingOs-in- themselves, of vlhiclh as suclh we have no knowledge, but which we klowv in their phenomena or mvanifestations. They are short expressions of the phenomena theimiselves. Power, for instance (or aiy other anialogous term, such as Force, or Energy), is niot an uniknowable soinethintg which makes things happen; it is a b)rief expression for tlle actual happeningt, of things. Brought to tlle test of this questioniin distinction, the six conceptions spoken of not only reveal their antlhropolmorplhic character-I lmleani as- beiing summaries of classes oi series of human experiences, niot applicable so far as we kniow to the Absolute or the Universe at larg,e-but also exhibit the phenomena wlichl they stuiinmarise as requiring explanation from regionls of existence which lie beyond the reach of l)ositive human knowledge. And it is thus a distinction lyingt withiin, and inseparably belongirng to, positive humiiiain kinowledge, wvhichi forces uls to this conielusion, forces us in thougcyht to transcend the splhere ivitlinl which the six conceptions are applicable. Anthropoomorplhic knowledge, in virtue of this its owii unavoidable distiinetion between niature anid history, folces us to look beyonid itself for anl explanationi of itself, ani explanation which, as anthropomilorphic, it is incapable of supplyin-g. As long as humani natuire seeks to know, anid this is one of its ineradicable tenldencies, so long must we apply this questioning distinctioni, so long Imiust the last thinig in the course of lhumiiian speculative thoughlt be a question ancd niot anl answel, so longo miiust a speculative ilsight iilto the Absoltute, or a specutlativxe construietioni of the Universe, be precludel.</page><page sequence="10">10 SHADWOT1iTf If. 1101 (.SON. I think that this surrender oni the part of plhilosophy of the expectation of obtaining a spectulative knowledge of the AbsoIluite, or constructive principle of tlim Universe, will be the result of moderin plhilosophical einoluiry. Buit the grounds on whiclh it rests will always folm an essential clhapter in the record of philosophical tlhought. Anid I amil aware that we are far enough at present fromii acquiescing in the surrenlder. In fact the question whether sulch a speculative conistruction is or is not vwithin our reach, must for a long time be kept openi. We caniiot foresee the time whein it will be geilerally accepted as decided in the sense which I have lhere-maintainied as the onlv practicable onie. But supposina it accepted, w-ouild the fuinctionl, the value, the inecessity of philosophy be injuriously affected tllereby, or wouild it furnish the smiiallest reason for regarding plhilosophy as a futile and vain pursuit ? Most certainly lyot. Truie, the ideal enid whichl phiilosophy iiiust propose to itself as the largest it cani conceive, discovery of the constructive principle of the Universe, would have lbeenl recognised as uniattainiable, but theni the discovery of its unattainability alnd of the reasons for it would have beeni made b1y plhilosoplhy, anid wvould of itself have become a gyreat step forwards in ouir kniowledae of the Universe. We slhoulld have founid that we inever lhad any riglht to make the assumiiptionl, that a speculative knowledge of its construction was attainiable. Like all other braiches of humiiain eflort arid thout,lit plhilosophy is niecessarily tentative. It does n(ot know beforehanid wh-ether it wvill succeed or fail in the attainmient of that enid whichl it takes beforelhand as the guLi(le of its eniquiries. It is only by their result that it can ascertain whether it is attainable or not. Notwithstandiiig the supposedl sturrelnder of this ideal, the whole content of hunman thouglht aind conduct still lies before philosophy, as the field for the applicatioln of its subjective method. Its special value in exploratioIn of that field remains entirely unaflected. It is still otur only valid iiieanis of dealing</page><page sequence="11">METHOI) IN PHIIIOSOPHIY. 11 withl the phenomena of huimarn feeling,, eiimotioni, desire. action, aiinI practice, the natuire anid justification of the conceptions of morlal rihlt and wrong, and the grounids, if any, wlhich nman's practical and nuiral nature affords for hiis elntertaining ideas colI(erning his relations to those uniseeni portions of the Universe, a speculative knowledge of wvhich hie lhas suirrendered as iiinattainable. Nor is it a siiiall benefit, that the supposed surrender, inchiding the discovery of the reasonis which render it iinpera- tive, and place maii's relations to the Universe in their true light, the light in which his ownl lnatur-e comipels himl to regard thenii, also preclutdes the settiig up of furtlher speculative theories concerning the conlstructive principle of the wlhole, in place of those which, fromii titrue to timiie, and in different couniitries, have l)een devised anid surlrenidered. The whole cointent of our conisciousness, every one of ouir conceptions, ideas, feelings, and affections is anthropomorphic; the bare idea of Being oir Existence, as the perripi ot a colntenit of conc)iousness, is man's idea; that there is an Uniiverse at all is a tlhougoht of ours. This content, lhowever, is forced uponi lIs, we cannot help experiencing it. Aiid it carries with it its own linmitations, the idea of experiences and existenices beyoind itself hut in relation to it, of wlicli, as beyonid itself, it can ne-ver have positive knowledge, anid anly idea of wbhicl, as in relationi to it, can only be an anthropomiorllic and inadequate idea. The perception of this truth will at once prevent any one who perceives it from directing his efforts to framne a specula- tive tlheory of the Universe, just as the perception that Being, or Existence in itself, apart fronm anly conscioussness of it, was the name for an iiunrealisable attemlpt at thinlkiig, the suggestion of a conception which we tried to frame and could not, precluded the hypothesis of a nininenal as distinguislhed fromn a phenomenal world. Now, to be finally relieved from following up attempts to flamne a speculative theory of the Universe, atteinpts whiclh frlio the nature of the case are foredooned to</page><page sequence="12">12 SHIADWORTH H. HODGSON. failure, is surely to be counted a gain, a benefit, an advantage to human thought. On the other lhand it is also, ilo doubt, truie, that witlh the surrender now supposed of all such attempts, a surrender founded on the perception of the anathropomorphic character of the whole content of humiiian consciousness, we lose that sense of intellectual security which would seem to have been one main motive, at any rate, for franming such speculative theories. We can no longer survey in thought the Universe from outside, so contemplating it in its entirety, and ascertaining the fixed laws which connect our hluman portion of it with the rest. We are compelled to survey it from within, our point of view being within the human portion; and from that poinlt of view no limiits of it can be imag,ined or conceived. The possibilities of modes of conscioulsness, different in kind from any whichl we at human beings possess, are beyond number, numberless; possi- bilities to our human thoicght, but actual existences, it miay be, in the Universe beyond. Human speculative thought is like an island of terra firma rising in the midst of an immeasurable ocean, in which no land, no rock, no anchorage for speculative thought, is discernible. Instead of the Universe being the island and human thought the ocean, the Universe has become the ocean, and human thought the island. The intellectual security to be derived froim a speculative theory of the Universe is gone; and the loss is nlo doubt great. The chanae which will be wrought by the surrender when it comes-and sooner or later it is ilnevitable-is enormous, and has both its bad and its good side. But, good or bad, it will be a recognition of fact, it will be forced upon us by experience, in which we shall have no choice but to acquiesce. What will be the position in which it leaves us? How are we to coniceive our relation to the Universe, when a speculative knowledge of the nature of the Universe is seen to be impossible ? It will be observed, that no alteration is made within the bounds of human expeiience. What is altered is the idea, that human</page><page sequence="13">METHOD IN I'lILOSOP11Y. 13 speculative knowledge extends to worlds beyonld tliat for whiclh hulmian experience gives us data, witliout ouIr lhaving data not belongin)g to hulmani experienlee, whiclh c hyl)othesi are impos- sible. The surrender of this idea involves ani alteration (1) in the attitude wlich we take iip witlh regar(1 to the Universe, mnak;ingr it a practical ilnstead of a specuilative onle; (2) in the relation of practical alnd speculative thought to each other. As to the first poinit, our idea of the Universe is itself anitlhropomiiorphic, and we calnnot framiie a larger idea, we cannot thinki of anything beyond it, not included in it, %vhile at the sanme tirmie we must think of portions of it as really existing, for a speculative knowledge of wlhiel no data are within our reaclh. Towards these portiolns therefore our attitude, nlot being, oine of kniowledge, must be one of coinfidence, a confideilt assurance that their laws are in harmiiony with tllose of our kn-iownl world, including those of hulmaln thought anid conduct. I say must be, because the tentativeness involved in all human thouglt and coniduct, beyonid the point of already acquired knowledge, of itself ilnvolves a confidence that the tenitative actioni will lnot be fruitless of desirable results. As to the seconid poilnt, the relationi of practical and speculative thouglht to eaclh otler, the clhang,e wrought by the surrenider in question will consist niot only in bringinlg, out the tentative chiaracter of all thought, but also in the surrender of the idea of the priority of knowledlge to consciousness, or of what is called the a priori character of formis of thought or of perception, formiis whicll are a prior coniditioni of all experience. Experienciing is a process in which all our kinowledge of being or of existence originates. The sinmplest sensationis, our ultimate data, are revelations. We have no at priogri or logical test of the trutlh of that kniowledge, that is, of its agreement with the being or existenice, of which we call it the knowledge. Logical niecessity, the necessity of the laws of thouight, is itself but a fact, tllough ani universal fact, of our experien-ce of being or existence. The harmony of tlhought with thought, of experience</page><page sequence="14">14 SITADWORTII H. IIODGSON. with experience, ilot of thought or experientce with beiivl or existence as separate from thought or experience, is that in whiclh truith consists. Experience simply as fact is thuis the guarantee of logical necessity, Inot logical necessity the guiarantee of fact. Of beincg or existence we can onlly say it is, 1not it n,ilvt be. But of these the is is practical, actually forced upoii uis as a fact; the must, be, were it possible, would be spweculative, being a iogical thought about fact. There is lno highler necessity than the practical universality of fact, the practical uniformity of law. And now a word, in conclusion, as to the bearing, of the foregoing renmarlks on the present positioni and prospects of philosophy in this country. I have shown you that the existence, the validitv, and the primacy of philosophy do not depend uipoIn its success in framing a speculative theory of the Universe; I have shownl you lhow it is, that nlo valid speculative theory of the Universe can be framed; I have shown you that all our knlowledg,e is based uponl data whiclh are revelations, in the sense that we have no further test of their truth; and that consequently oulr so-ealled knowledge of that which we think of as the source of those revelationis is of necessity a practical idea, lnot a speculative conceptioi. Now religion is a certain kinid of practical attitude which we take towards that samiie source of the revelations spoken of, anid in that character necessarily formiis part of the field of philosophical investigation. Religion and a specuilative theology are therefore two essenitially different things, as differelnl as, on the otlher lhand, are a specu- lative theology and philosophy. But what says the ordinary iEnglishmianl, imilbued witlh the current group of common-senise ideas and beliefs, whiclh I spoke of at the outset ? He ideentifies religion witlh some forni or other of speculative tlheology, anid he identifies speculative theolog,y with philosoply. Some formii or other of speciulative tbeologty is what he neans by philosophy. In wlhat I caninot btut cail hiis arbitrary limitatioin of visioni, 11e refuses eveni to glanie at what</page><page sequence="15">mETUllOD IN P1HILOSOPhIY. 15 philosoplhy really is ii its true nature. His own particular form of speculative theology, he will tell you, is eniough for hiim; lhe finds it practically sufficient for his religious needs. And so perhaps it miiay be, btut, then, what becomes of its validity as a speculative thieology ? Now I think that the growing divergence of these speculative theologies from one another, and the growiilg dissatisfaction with the speculative validity of any one of tliemii, are signs that even Englishmen are colmiing to see the necessity of philosoplhy, as that line of thoughlt which, from its independ(lent inivestigationi of humnan nature as a whole, can aloine afford a theoretical justification of religion, as a certain kindcl of practical attitude towards the speculatively unknowni an1d uinkinowable regiolns of the Uniiverse. What we need is, that a deeper and an increasing interest should be takeni in the nature and purpose of philosoplhy, and in the miieanls at its disposal, an(I the metlhod best adapted, for attaining that puirpose.</page></plain_text>
