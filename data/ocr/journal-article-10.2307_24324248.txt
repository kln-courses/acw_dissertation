<plain_text><page sequence="1">CCLR 4|20io Editorial I 319 Editorial Africa is the world's second largest and second most populous continent. It is amazingly diverse culturally and geographically, rich in natural resources and now predominantly free (although still recovering) from centuries of European colonisation. It is, however, also stricken by poverty and home to those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Four years have now elapsed since the announcement by United Nations (UN) Secretary General Kofi Annan of the Nairobi Framework at the 12th Session of the Conference of the Parties, where numerous UN agencies committed to increasing African participation in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In those four years, the attention of the inter national climate community has been distracted from its Nairobi goals by the chimera of Copenhagen, the economic recession, the rise of Brazil, India and China as climate "play ers" and the convoluted twin track negotiation process. As a result, the UN and its mem ber states have still failed to address the plight of those who have contributed the least to anthropomorphic climate change. Nowhere in the climate sphere is this issue of the "Invisible Man"1 more starkly highlighted than in the operation of the CDM market. Only 156 African projects are listed within the UNEP Riso CDM pipeline, 2.7% of the total market. A majority of Africa's 52 countries do not have a single CDM project.2 Although the latest climate summit in Canc√ºn, Mexico, did provide substantive out comes which will start to address the invisibility of Africa within the climate discourse (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries or REDD+, the Green Climate Fund, and the Technology Mechanism), it is arguable that only the development of autochthonous climate solutions from within Africa will enable the paradigm shift necessary for Africa to successfully address its mitigation and adapta tion challenges. The articles in this Africa edition of the Carbon and Climate Law Review highlight the broad space within which these indigenous solutions may develop. Indeed, the thematic part of this edition covers a broad range of African topics: de Witt Wijnen and Simonetti kick off the issue with a thorough description of the challenges of implementing programmatic CDM. The authors highlight the potential of Programmes of Activities (PoAs) to contribute to the implementation of micro projects (such as solar cook ers, LED lighting, household biomass, livestock management, and so forth) that genuinely contribute to sustainable development. The following article by Christopher Tung consid 1 "I am an invisible man. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fibre and liquids - and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me." Ralph W. Ellison, Invisible Man (New York: Random House, 1953). 2 UNEP Riso, "CDM Pipeline", available on the Internet at &lt;www.cd4cdm.org&gt; (last accessed 11 January 2011 ).</page><page sequence="2">320 I Editorial CCLR412010 ers the role of China in supporting the development of climate policies in Africa. This South-South cooperation is entrenched in the climate negotiations through the G77 + 1 and is of increasing relevance as the world returns to a multi-polar international order. The role of structural reform is the key message of both the contribution of Owino and Morton and the country study of Gilder and du Toit. Without appropriate legal frameworks, inno vative projects struggle to take root. One such innovative project within the Democratic republic of Congo is described in the following article by Mushiete and Merrill. The Bateke agro-forestry project is notable not only for innovative structuring but also its ambitious goals for community development. This attempt to create true sustainable development when mitigating climate change is at the heart of the final contribution on the evolution of construction standards for rammed earth housing by Keable. Although outside the traditional project paradigm of the CDM, this article highlights how locally generated legal tools can unlock entrenched unsustainable patterns of behaviour. From the meta-level of targeted international relationships such as the 2009 climate partnership developed by the 4th Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to the micro-level of developing climate-friendly building standards across the African continent, a persistent theme of the contributions is the key role of the legal "toolbox" in meeting African climate goals. In addition, the energy sector reform measures outlined in the case study by Gilder and du Toit highlight the leadership role of South Africa within the continent, a role that will be crucial in the lead up to the 17th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP17) in Durban later this year. While the project studies of programmatic LED lighting within the CDM and the management of the Bateke Carbon Sink Plantation provide ample example of what can be achieved when the "toolbox" is skilfully used to overcome transaction barriers, the use of a combined CERA/CU contracting structure in the Bateke case is of particular interest and will hope fully be of precedent value. The lack of attention afforded both by the international community and the carbon market to Africa and its struggle with the impacts of climate change should not be con strued as purely negative. It has given space for African policy makers, project developers, academics, land-owners and financial institutions to start developing solutions to the chal lenges of mitigation and adaptation that are evolving from the bottom-up, replacing the aid mentality of the Nairobi Framework's top down approach to assistance. These home grown solutions enable climate change solutions to be appropriately placed in the wider context of local, national and regional African policy goals, in particularly the struggle to alleviate poverty and its consequences across the continent. In the lead-up to the climate summit in Durban, it is appropriate to recall that the President of the 12th Session of the Conference of the Parties in Nairobi, Minister Kivutha Kibwana,3 invited the international community to "expand the creative space" when considering options to stabilize atmos pheric concentrations of greenhouse gases while enabling economic development to pro ceed in a sustainable way. It is clear from this issue of the Carbon and Climate Law Review that some within the continent are responding to this challenge and hopefully they will be joined bv manv more before the commencement of COP17 on 8 November 2011.
