<plain_text><page sequence="1">London Old master paintings and drawings Bond Street and St James's yielded a rich harvest of exhibitions this summer although, unusually, only one was devoted to old master drawings - that presented by Kate Ganz at Douwes Fine Art (closed 8thJuly). It is now something of an achieve- ment for a dealer to have unpublished sheets of high quality by Parmigianino, Barocci, Taddeo Zuccaro and Annibale Carracci, and this in a total of only thirty- five drawings. The Barocci (no.3), a study from life for the head ofJoseph of Arimathea in the Senigallia Entombment is a superb example of his coloured chalk technique. Zuccaro's study of individual figures for the earliest composition of the Last supper in S. Maria della Consolazione, Rome (no.2), helps firm up this fresco's genesis; its soft technique and modelling in black and white chalks on blue paper also remind us of Taddeo's renewed contact with Barocci in Urbino a few years earlier. The crisp and well-preserved Parmigianino, last re- corded in the eighteenth century and known to Popham only through a print, combines a Hercules fighting the Nemean lion from an antique relief with sketchier adaptation from figures in Marcantonio's Massacre of the innocents. This exhibition provided the first public opportunity to study the coloured 'cartoon' (Fig.74) closely related to the Erigone pub- lished as by Guido Reni in this Magazine (CXXVIII, 1986, pp.208-09) by Stephen Pepper, who clairvoyantly raised the possi- bility of such a drawing's existence. It is on two sheets (the image on the right-hand sheet continuing under the overlap), is freely drawn in black chalk, then coloured over loosely in oil and some tempera, and corresponds closely in scale to the figure in the painting. It appears to be the in- 570</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS termediary between the figure dressing Venus's hair in the National Gallery's Toilet of Venus, a not entirely autograph work of c. 1628, and the Erigone of about a decade later, and has already sparked some contro- versy.1 It is even possible that the left- hand portion is a large-scale drawing left over from the Toilet of Venus, and its sensi- tive and beautiful elaboration and enlarge- ment may help explain how the many repetitions in Guido's late output were conceived and executed. Another work which has appeared at a topical moment, is a strikingly direct and richly painted oil sketch on paper of a blind man by Annibale Carracci (Fig.71), an outstanding example of Annibale's early genre style, more con- vincing in its characterisation of blindness than the later series of smaller sketches recently published by Anna Ottani Cavina as of members of a compagnia dei ciechi.2 An unpublished double-sided sheet of male nude studies (no.5) provided an example of Annibale's chalk drawing at its most suave, while a large and highly finished sheet (Fig.69) with figural types close to Ludovico is convincingly added to the tiny drawn oeuvre of his pupil Lucio Massari. Later drawings included a crisp oil sketch by Francesco Monti (no.25), and an im- pressive black-and-white-chalk study on blue paper by Juste Aurele Meisonnier showing a design for a silver relief (no.24). Nineteenth-century English drawings- a new departure for Miss Ganz- included Burne-Jones's finished gouache study for one of the mosaics in the American church at Rome (no.35). The refreshingly laconic catalogue reproduces everything in colour.3 Leger Galleries' exhibition of British paintings and drawings (closed 9th June) was well up to their usual high standard, with grand-tour portraits by Anton von 70. Transportation and burial qof'St Stephen's body, by Mariotto di Nardo. Tempera and gold leaf on panel. 28.5 by 54 cm. (Exh. Thos Agnew &amp; Sons, London). Maron and Pompeo Batoni thrown in for good measure (nos.25 and 26). Gains- borough could be studied in almost every facet of his output, from the charming very early drawing of a young man beneath a tree (no.3, surely based on a lay-figure), through the sumptuous if slightly stiff full- length Dehany family group of the early Bath period (no.24), to the loosely drawn late black-and-white chalk Woodman (no.7) who reappears in various guises in the late 'cottage-door' pictures. Most lovely were the four varnished landscape drawings in Gainsborough's idiosyncratic technique of oil and water-colour (no.6), which shows him at his most lyrical. Characteristic full- lengths by Hoppner and Reynolds (nos. 11 and 9) and Romney (no.10) were a prelude to Lawrence's three-quarter length por- trait of Canning from Tyningham (no.12) where the intense and intelligent charac- terisation of the sitter is not swamped - as too often happens with this artist - by bravura brushwork. England's golden age of the pursuit of happiness (for some- the prolix catalogue eschews any hint of the new art history)4 was well represented by two Devis conversation-pieces, one of which, Mr and Mrs Parker in a landvcape (Fig.72) comes near to being his master- piece, Wheatley's Campbellfamily (19), and the best portrait group by the underrated Henry Walton to have been seen for some time (no.21). The curious indoor conver- sation-piece from Narford Hall (no.23), dateable by the costumes to the mid-1770s, cannot, despite much pleading in the cata- logue, be admitted into John Singleton Copley's weuvre. Its meticulous attention to details of furnishing, harsh lights and well- defined shadows (to say nothing of the fig- ures' odd proportions), though typical of 69. 1 69.

Leger Galleries, London). provincial artists who relied, as Copley did, on mezzotints for keeping up with pic- torial fashions, are not enough to sustain the attribution. This depends on two draw- ings in the Courtauld Institute Collection ascribed to Copley in the 1930s but rightly rejected by Jules Prown: these are certainly of a type that Copley used, but the out- lining and chunky mechanical hatching are foreign to Copley's much more pictorial way of treating such studies, as in those for the Pepperell group. It should also be added that despite its provenance from Narford, there is no evidence that the pic- ture portrays members of the Fountaine family.5 The exhibition was rounded off with fine water-colours by Turner and Constable's very sketchy oil sketch for the Opening of Waterloo Bridge (no.31). More Constable was to be seen at Agnew's over-modestly entitled show, Recent Acquisitions (closed 25th July). If his pair of portraits of the Lea family (no.7) demonstrates how sensible he was to give up this branch of art, the newly- discovered full-size sketch for the Glasgow Hampstead Heath with St Paul's in the distance of 1830 triumphantly vindicates his choice of landscape. This was the star of the British pictures, which included a particularly good Henry Morland fancy-piece of a girl by candle-light (no.28; but not reproduced) and an excellent John Glover (no.16), while a fluid and beautifully lit Gericault oil-sketch of horses is a good example of the Englishness of this French artist - though it was surely not painted in Eng- land as the catalogue6 suggests. Agnew's most exciting 'find' is three predella panels from Mariotto di Nardo's now dismembered altar-piece of 1408 for S. Stefano in Pane, near Florence (Fig.70). Compositionally naive though these are, they provide fascinating evidence, both in colouration and in the landscape, of Mariotto's links with Sienese art. The most haunting of several portraits in the show was the Head of a woman by Orazio Gentileschi (Fig.75). Despite its evident origins as a piece of erotica in Charles I's collection (it has been cut down to suppress a naked breast) its sensitive characterisation and luminosity are (condition notwith- standing) outstandingly fine. In this issue of the Magazine, mention must also be made of the elephant that Poussin painted for Cassiano dal Pozzo.7 David Jaff6's recent researches, not known to the cata- loguers, have revealed that this beast was sighted in Paris in 1627 and was in Rome in 1630. Reports of it reached dal Pozzo's correspondent, Peiresc, who had it sent to Aix for extensive investigation: it weighed in at 4,500 Provengal pounds, measured with 120 cannon-balls.8 After the reticent presentation at Agnew's Heim Gallery's Towards a new taste (closed 25th July) was altogether more ritzy:9 the titillating pastiche of Fuseli by Theodore von Holst (no.24), and the gothick Witch of Endor by the intriguing Januarius Zick (no.23), among others, will perhaps tickle the jaded palate. On firmer ground Rey- nolds's early portrait of Bobby Shafto and Pierre-Alexandre Wille's Liseuse of 1780 (nos.31 and 20) were both good examples of their type. A seventeenth-century por- trait (no.13) has claims to be a self-portrait of Philippe de Champaigne, but the most powerful picture on show was undoubtedly Louis-Michel van Loo's portrait of the Abbe de Breteuil (Fig.76), brilliantly coloured and as much a portrait of Abbe's 73.

Van Loo was also unexpectedly to be found at the Walpole Gallery's exhibition of Italian landscapes and views (closed 28th July), adding the figures of the Good Samaritan and his fellow-travellers to a magnificent early landscape by Gaspard Dughet (Fig.77). This was the greatest revelation among the Italianised foreigners in the show, who included Vanvitelli, Orizzonte at his most Gaspardesque and 'Poussin' (the lovely ex-Morrison 'silver birch' Land- scape with a goatherd). The accuracy of the northern vedutisti nicely contrasted with the more cavalier approach of the native Italians seen at its most outrageous in Pietro della Vecchia's splendid anthropomorphic baroque rock (no.4) and at its most poetic in Mico Spadaro's Hagar and the angel. A landscape with figures hunting of great delicacy and brilliant colour with strong Flemish overtones presented something of a puzzle; it is more sensitively handled than Magnasco is apt to be, and I wonder if Diziani might not be nearer the mark. All in all this was a very pleasant survey, though lacking Bolognesi.10 At Matthiessen Fine Art an interest- ing exhibition of French painting mainly of the eighteenth century (closed 28th July) contained works by Bidault (no.27), Restout (no.13), Largilliere (nos.2 and 3) and Nat- tier (no.11), to name some of the more prominent artists. Of the earlier pictures, the most accomplished was Nicolas Bertin's small panel of the Danaides in the underworld (Fig.73) combining Rubensian forms with high colouring and an intense gem-like finish. A pair of hunting scenes by Oudry (no.6) showed all his virtuosity as both landscape and animal painter on a small scale, and a pair of Italianate landscapes by the little-known Claude-Louis Chatelet (no.23) had all the charm of Hubert Robert combined with flickering brushwork to give a muted pastel-like effect. The emigre Legrand de Lerant's large group portrait of the Biirki family showed some luscious passages of drapery painting breaking into the sober characterisation of this solidly Swiss family, whose obvious virtues would, one hopes, not prevent them from appreci- ating Claude-Joseph Vernet's wildly romantic Storm scene. A useful supplement to the catalogue1 records the more im- portant French pictures recently sold by the gallery. DUNCAN BULL 'See R.
