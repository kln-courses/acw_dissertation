<plain_text><page sequence="1">420 Recent Literature EJAuk Chance's 'The Truth about the Cuckoo.'-In his second book,' Mr. Chance again tells the truth about certain aspects of the life history of the European Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). The reviewer was not aware that the author's previous book, 'The Cuckoo's Secret' had failed to convince bird students that the cuckoo (1) lays the egg directly into the fosterer's nest and (2) deposits the eggs on alternate days. These points are adequately proved in the detailed series of experiments recounted in the body of the book. The author manipulated the nests of the hosts so that the cuckoo would have nests available for cuckolding. A series of excellent motion- pictures shows the details of oviposition. The principal host, the Meadow Pipit, and several less important hosts are treated in the descriptive chapters. The interpretive chapters deal briefly with several subjects. The theory that the cuckoo lays the egg on the ground and then places it with the beak or from the gullet into the nest of the host is refuted. The adherence of a particular cuckoo to a certain species of fosterer is again affirmed. Admittedly basing his opinion on insufficient evidence, the author concludes that cuckoos are monog- amous and pair for life. The theory that each female maintains a territory, at least in respect to one species of host, seems well founded. A description of the young cuckoo, call notes and the variation in egg markings comprises three chapters. It must be remembered that these studies are based on the extremely probable assumption that the identity of a cuckoo can be determined by the mark- ings on the eggs. This assumption should be definitely proved. The book con- tains much valuable data on the host species and a chapter by R. C. Punnett on the genetical aspects of the cuckoo's life history. The author obviously did not intend this book to be a monograph of the life history of the cuckoo. Accordingly there is no correlation of the literature. How- ever, the experiments of Jenner in 1787 on the method by which the young cuckoo ejects the rightful occupants are quoted extensively. It is hoped that Mr. Chance will write another book making available his knowledge of the life history of this interesting bird. The complete truth would include such essential points as the incubation period, survival and development of the young, activities of the male, and a correlation with the voluminous literature on the various species of cuckoos. Banding experiments could prove the assumption that a cuckoo lays in the nests of that species by which she herself was raised. The author should avoid the lapses into the anthropomorphic and mystical viewpoints.-D. E. DAVIS.</page></plain_text>
