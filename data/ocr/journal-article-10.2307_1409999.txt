<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; SOCIETY VOLUME IO, NUMBER I, SUMMER 1983 Behavioral Sociology of Law: A Critique of Donald Black ALAN HUNT* INTRODUCTION This essay critically examines the sociological theory of law of Donald Black. It has received substantial discussion in the United States and in Australia and rather less in Britain. His claim is to have created a coherent general theory. One central feature is that it appears to offer a bridge between general theory and empirical application and testing. It is pre- cisely the long-standing gap between general theories of law and empirical studies of legal phenomena (a distinction which is often demarcated by the labels "sociology of law" and "socio-legal studies") which Black offers to close. Indeed the main trend of responses to Black's work has taken the form of attempts to empirically test some of Black's major theses.[1] These studies broadly accept the methodology he proposes and, through appli- cation to a variety of empirical data, concern themselves with seeking to test the hypotheses advanced. Interesting though this work is, it runs the risk of accepting without discussion or debate the theoretical process which produces the theses being "tested". It is this more fundamental critical examination upon which this essay focuses. It is my argument that Black's theory of "the behaviour of law" is methodologically and theoretically deficient and that its bankruptcy can be demonstrated without going further than Black's own writings.[2] The absence of systematised theory within the sociology of law may create the conditions in which Black's theory will, by default, achieve a degree of acceptance. Such a development would, I shall argue, be a considerable set-back for the sociological study of law. Donald Black is not afflicted by any false modesty; he speaks of this theory as "the sociological theory of law". In his recent essays in Manners and Customs, "A Note on the Measurement of Law", to which I will return later, he claims: It is, indeed, a remarkable fact that only now has the concept of law been formulated [by Donald Black] so that law itself is observable and measurable . . . The study of law will never be the same . . someday the marvel will surely be how anyone ever attempted a sociology of law without it.[3] An important dimension of Black's claim goes beyond its apparent "testability". He lays claim to a wider strand in American sociology which responds to the attraction of a general theory: he advances a rigorous * Head of School of Law, Middlesex Polytechnic. 19</page><page sequence="2">apolitical professionalised sociology with a single uniform methodology and a single integrated view of the world. Yet despite the extravagant claims, I shall argue that Black's sociology of law amounts to nothing more and nothing less than an attempt to systematise "common-sense"; and no amount of systematisation and theoretical abstraction can turn common-sense into good sense, let alone transform it into science. I will seek to show that his theory is not nor could be value free; in fact the value content of Black's theory embodies major features of what I call "reactionary common sense"; nowhere is this clearer than in his treatment of the police and racism. The behaviorist meth- odology is in principle unsound as excluding that which is necessary and pertinent to understanding or explaining social life and any sociology which denies or eschews these objectives should have its title to be undertaking "sociology" challenged. Nor indeed, I will argue, does Black succeed in limiting himself to observable "behavior". Further, his methodology is flawed by its confusion of correlation and causality. The imperative definition of law upon which he relies reinforces the simplistic behavioral theses he advances. I seek to show, then, not only that the structure and content of his theory is defective, but beyond that to demonstrate that his major claim that all legal phenomena are quantifiable, upon which he bases his claim to the empirical testability of his theory, is poorly developed and is incapable of being given empirical application. Hence I hope to show that the apparent attraction of a general theory which expresses itself through a limited number of deceptively simple theses capable of empirical application and testing is a mirage and should not detain the attention of those concerned to advance sociological knowledge and understanding of law. VALUES, SCIENCE AND BEHAVIOR The main framework of Black's sociology of law exhibits considerable continuity. The broad outlines of his position are most clearly stated in his paper "The Boundaries of Legal Sociology"; The Behavior of Law is an elaboration and expansion of these positions and the additional essays in Manners and Customs are either celebrations of the foregoing or attempts to patch up deficiencies in the edifice.[4] The objection he raises against modern sociology of law is that it continues, albeit in more sophisticated form, the tradition of the Legal Realists and the consequent commitment to policy considerations and pragmatic reformism. Black is unequivocal in his commitment to science; science is necessarily "value free", and here he makes his deferential bow to Max Weber. He takes note of Alvin Gouldner's powerful and influential assault on value neutrality.[5] Yet like the religious fanatic who, learning of the prevalence of sin, redoubles his prayers, so Black proposes to be even more rigorous in purging science of all values and thereby reveals his failure to understand the main thrust of the critique of positivism, that the pursuit of value neutrality is an 20</page><page sequence="3">unrealisable goal, which Gouldner, despite certain simplifications, did much to make accessible to American sociology. Thus one side of Black's commitment to positivism is his espousal of "pure sociology of law" and he is explicit that this sense of "purity" is parallel to Kelsen's "pure theory of law" in the sense of seeking to produce an uncontaminated product, purged of all values. This illusion persists and in 1980 he is still insisting: This theory involves a total and final departure from all discourse that in any way evaluates the legal life of the natural world. It neither approves nor disapproves of law of any kind, but simply passes over in silence all matters of a critical nature.[6] I will seek to show in a later section that the substantive content of Black's work is actually riddled with political and value judgments.[7] Black's positivism is part of a wider attempt to avoid the persistent dualism which haunts the history of social theory between a realm of events in nature and the realm of social action. The tradition, signposted by Weber, focuses attention upon the exploration of "social action" and leaves "behavior" as a residual category; it has provided the major theoretical paradigm of modern sociology. But Black, in seeking to expunge the complexities inherent in concern with human intention and purpose, fails to abolish or avoid this problem; he ends by merely reproducing it in its mirror image. He elevates "behavior", but is not able to remove or abolish "social action". Rather it keeps creeping back in by way of the concepts he is forced to use but which are rendered meaningless without their association with purposive social action.[8] Black's position is positivistic in a second and quite distinct sense. In this respect he invokes not Weber but Durkheim. To aspire to the status of science, sociology of law must study "natural phenomena" which provide evidence (in the form of sense data) that is independent of any meta- physical concern with "essence" or with principles, purposes or objectives. What remains as the data upon which scientific work can operate is "behavior", the external, observable and (hopefully) measurable actions of human individuals and institutions. Whilst the connection with Durkheim is clear, it is also apparent that Black's transformation of Durkheim's edict, "treat social facts as things", into "all we can study is behavior" is a cruder, more simplistic version of positivist methodology. He seeks to purge sociological data of all subjective content, specifically, of will, intention and the purposes of social actors. Durkheim's positivism, whilst recognis- ing the problematic character of such data, seeks not to exclude it but to seek indirect sources of evidence; his extensive discussion of law arises precisely from his quest for an evidential intermediary in the exploration of more diffuse and opaque concepts. Central is his "use" of law to grapple with his more complex concept of "social solidarity": Since law reproduces the principal forms of social solidarity, we have only to classify the different types of law to find therefrom the different types of social solidarity which correspond to it.[9] 21</page><page sequence="4">Stinchcombe argues that Black's self-denying ordinance in adhering to a strict positivism yields greater scientific rigor than is achievable by the more discursive Weberian-style sociology of law.[10] The contrary is the case: a theory which seeks to exclude human consciousness and self- consciousness from its purview invalidates its claim to be a "social" theory because, as will be demonstrated below, behavioralism is inescapably reductionist.[11] It is necessarily arid and barren in that it mistakes scientism for science. The inherent limitations of the methodology adopted are evidence in so far as Black, whether consciously or unconsciously, persistently violates his own methodology. Whilst he is primarily concerned with quantitative variation in law he also introduces a second dimension of variation in law, "styles of law". These styles he designates as penal, compensatory, therapeutic and conciliatory. These correspond to, and are the result of, different styles of social control. He nowhere indicates how or from where this typology of styles of law is generated; where do these rather than other categories derive from? They are plucked intuitively from a presumed natural relation between observer and social life. Whatever else may be said about the merits of this typology it is clear that the categories themselves are constructed upon and are inseparable from conceptions of human intentions, purposes and goals. As they stand his introduction of a typology of "styles of law" contradicts his express commitment to be- havioral methodology. Since they can have no other theoretical grounding in his theory they are thereby reduced to arbitrary additions.[12] It is also noticeable that Black makes very little use of this second dimension of variation of law. Reference to "style" is occasionally and unsystematically introduced. His hesitancy may either reveal some level of awareness of the contradiction inherent in his methodology or alternatively it may stem from his inability to realise a methodological device for measuring the quantitative variation which he insists is also characteristic of styles of law. In Manners and Customs, however, the distinction between penal and conciliatory styles of policing is persistently invoked as a natural or self-evident antinomy in police practice; yet Black claims that his theory: abandons the common sense of law ... as well as every other effort to understand law that does not pertain entirely to the facts.[13] The central deficiency of "the sociological theory of law" lies in the commitment to "behavior". The commitment to limit the raw material of sociology to observable and/or measurable acts is like trying to listen to a piece of music by watching oscillations of a meter registering variations in amplitude on our stereo amplifiers; astronomers have had to develop highly sophisticated techniques for analysing similar data only because it is their only data not because such data embodies "the scientific method".[14] The behavioral orientation is more seriously defective pre- 22</page><page sequence="5">cisely because it is incapable of achieving the rigorous exclusion of value/subjectivity because even this apparently "pure" concept "behavior" is riddled with value-laden assumptions about human nature derived from a psychological theory of a broadly utilitarian character which assumes a motivational structure of pursuit of interests/avoidance of sanctions. The assumption of sanction avoidance is reinforced by his unexplored associ- ation between "law" and "social control", since his concept of the latter cannot function without the assumption of a rewards/sanctions account of human motivation. There are certain types of study where the behavioral frame of reference is both pertinent and necessary. In much biological work it is a necessary requirement as a device that avoids any lapse into anthropomorphic assumptions about "will" and "intention" in the determination of animal behavior. This need arises not because of any universal barrier between biological and social science but as a sharp warning about our relative ignorance which makes it necessary to proscribe assumptions about will, intention and sociality in biological studies. But the behavioral frame of reference in the social sciences is not only unnecessary but fails, as I have argued, to achieve the level of purity or value-freedom that its protagonists purport to offer. Even if these deficiencies were not enough to compel rejection there are two further deficiencies. The first of these is the problem of "aggregation" or the nature of the transition from statements about the behavior of individual units of the object of enquiry (i.e. individual people) to statements about the behavior of aggregates (i.e. of "society" or "law"). Behavioralism is forced by its own logic to assume a simple aggregation model; "social" behavior is the aggregation of individual behavior. Such an assumption removes the very object, "social activity"/"society", which is constitutive of the field of inquiry itself. We may, for example, observe the daily behavior of X: who wakes at a certain time, showers, dresses, consumes fruit juice and coffee, etc., etc. By observing further individuals we will observe sequences of regularities and discontinuities. Any "explan- ation" of such "simple" activities sets up the need to explore these patterns along two alternative modes of explanation: patterns as results of aggre- gation of individual behavior and patterns as results of social determin- ations. It is the latter which behavioralism excludes. The logical self-denial of behavioralism disarms its capacity to engage in sociological inquiry; this is the first major respect in which the nature of the theory removes any possibility of fulfilling the promise to "explain". The second fundamental deficiency is that of the "reification" involved in the transition from the statement "individuals behave" to "law be- haves". To make such a statement necessitates extensive attributions that violate the purportedly "pure" methodology of behaviorism. Let us take one of Black's most cited examples of legal behavior: a police arrest. The activity is not "legal behavior" unless we make a social attribution about 23</page><page sequence="6">the social role and normative framework within which the individual acts who is identified as "police" by uniform, badge, etc. But is also requires a conception of "citizen" to make statements about the relation between police and the arrested person. Any statement that purports to present "the behavior of law" involves a reification that transgresses the epi- stemological and methodological requirements of behavioral positivism. This is no simple failure of Black's applications but it is a consequence of the incoherence and impossibiity of the methodology itself. The reification in Black's sociology is closely associated with another characteristic, namely its ahistorical universalism; he aspires to produce a theory which is "general".[15] It is a characteristic feature of Black's work that the difficulties and problems associated with this assertion of theoretical universalism are not discussed, nor is there any hint that objections might be raised. There is, however, a real and important clash within social theory between those who, like Black, propose a universal general theory, and those who insist upon some form of historical or cultural specificity as a limiting condition of social theory. Without rehearsing that wider debate it is necessary to note the consequence for his treatment of law. His method of providing supporting evidence for his formulations about the variation of law is to cite (incidentally the citations are of published work without any detailed discussion of the content) "evidence" from a wide range of cross-cultural and anthropological studies. The adoption of universalism leads to a very problematic nominalism in which social phenomena, such as "law", "social control", etc., are deemed to exist in all social systems. Consequentially he abolishes or evades questions about whether or not it is legitimate to posit the existence of "law" in societies without state formations. Once this issue is posed it strikes at the very heart of the assumption that law, and its associated variations, is a universal phenom- enon. Black claims that the objective of behavioral study is "the prediction and explanation of legal variation". Regrettably he simply asserts his meth- odology, and does not engage in any discussion of its implications or problems. To establish a correlation between A and B does nothing more than allow us to make statements about the frequency with which phenomenon A will be associated with phenomenon B. No degree of correlation "explains", that is, provides an account of "why A is associated with B". Nor can such correlations lead to statements about the causal relation between A and B, whether A determines or influences B, or vice versa, or whether both are causally related to another variable. It follows that Black does not provide "a sociological theory of law" (let alone "the theory"); what he does is to advance a list of propositions (e.g. "law varies directly with stratification"[16]) which are theoretically unassociated. The only value that hypotheses (as distinct from theory) can have is to point to some avenues of investigation and inquiry rather than others; they are not and cannot constitute "a theory", but for Black to predict is to explain. 24</page><page sequence="7">These difficulties are compounded by the manner, particularly marked in Behavior of Law, in which he deploys his propositions. They are first asserted, e.g. "the relationship betwen law and differentiation is curvi- linear".[17] This is followed by the citation of apparently supportive evidence; but this citation is in a very general form usually by reference to an individual writer. Thus, for example, in support of the above quoted proposition he cites, inter alia, Weber, Parsons, and Durkheim; now almost any account of the development of law embraces some association with the expansion of the division of labour, yet the three authors referred to offer very different theoretical accounts. Rather more important is the complete failure to consider or to even mention counter-factual empirical evidence. Black's text is in serious respects unscholarly because his propositions are unproblematically supported by partial and limited citation of evidence. His central proposition, that "law varies inversely with other social control",[18] is tautological in character. Since law is conventionally defined as one of the forms of social control, it is tautological to contend that there is more law when other social control is weaker, or vice versa. These logical implications only apply on the assumption, which seems implicit in his position but is not stated, that the total quantity of social control remains constant; indeed I would suggest that an important case embodying a shift to more authoritarian modes of social control (of which the present radical conservative regimes in the U.S.A. and Britain are examples) is characterised by an "increase" in both law and other forms of social control. If we assume, as seems sensible, that social control can and does vary quantitatively as well as qualitatively then the tautological proposition falls and there is no reason advanced as to why when the quantity of social control varies, the relation of law to other forms of social control should be inverse. Indeed as I have argued in more detail elsewhere this proposition is but one example of a persistent assumption in the sociology of law that there is a dichotomous relationship between consent and coercion or that the history of social control can be written as fluctuations between these poles, with positive evaluation being placed on the maximisation of consensual forms of social control.[19] The fact that this type of thesis is widespread and commonly invoked does nothing to elevate Black's proposition to the status of theory and certainly not to that of science. Finally, Black's behavioral positivism is a form of reductionism, that is it purports to advance analysis of the "social", which of course includes the will, intentions, purposes and values of social beings (and it is because of the perceived difficulty or impossibility of dealing with such data that Black proposes the reduction, to that of behavior.) Now I take the view that reductionism in itself is not objectionable, indeed, as Nagel demonstrates, it is widely and successfully employed in the natural sciences.[20] The problem with reductionist theories is the manner in which the two levels 25</page><page sequence="8">are connected, that is, what sort of linking propositions or assumptions are made. Black's version of behavioral reductionism operates with a simple but entirely unsatisfactory, and therefore unacceptable, definitional iden- tity between the two levels; his position necessarily asserts that behavioral regularities and correlations (excluding values, etc.) explain social life (which includes values, etc.). The assertive and non-problematic character of Black's exposition suggests that he is either unaware of these deficiencies or that he has chosen to ignore the difficulties so as not to put in jeopardy the claimed elegance and simplicity of this theory. Perhaps we would do well to remember the story of the emperor's new clothes; Black's own extravagant claims should not be allowed to prevent us seeing his theoretical and methodological nudity. LAW AND SOCIAL SPACE Black defines law as "governmental social control". It is more than a little surprising that after a century or more of sustained criticism of imperative conceptions of law he should advance such a discredited definition.[21] It is not worth going into detail in this well-rehearsed field, which he simply chooses to ignore. It is sufficient to point to the consequences of the adoption of such a definition. Social control necessarily involves the existence and application of sanctions (whether positive or negative, i.e., rewards or punishments). But the concept "government" remains unspeci- fied. Unless he intends a restrictive meaning, then it follows that his definition of law excludes vast areas of civil law that carry neither positive or negative sanctions, such as the making of wills or of contracts.[22] Further, it fails to allow any distinction between "lawful" and "unlawful" governmental conduct; this will be shown to have particular importance with respect to the problem of "unlawful" police conduct. "Watergate" was governmental social control and logically indistinguishable, under Black's definition, from executive fulfilment of Supreme Court rulings. Even more damaging is Black's exclusion of "rules" as constitutive, in part or whole, of law; and further it excludes from the purview of the sociology of law the substantive content of legal rules. Consequentially he must disallow any conception of "legality" or "illegality"; he can say nothing beyond that which government acts against or rewards is law. It is doubtful if it would even allow Black to distinguish a policeman or a judge from anyone who wore a badge or put on a wig. With such definition of law there is no need for a sociology of law; most questions about law that could be regarded as significant or important are excluded. Black's conception of law is entirely contingent. His general hypotheses concerning the relation of law to stratification, culture, organisation and integration reduce law to the status of a contingent or dependent variable. The sociology of law should seek to avoid the assumptions of legal 26</page><page sequence="9">autonomy often found in jurisprudential theory, but it destroys itself if it removes, as Black does, the examination of the effect of legal rules and practices on social action. The problematic of the effectivity of law (i.e. the extent, conditions and degree of legal impact) constitutes if not the central focus, then at least a major one, of any discipline worthy of the label sociology of law. His definition of law as government social control leads him to posit the absence of law as anarchy. This unexplored statist conception of law is not so much a theory as a simple dichotomous typology which yields circular or tautologous results, in which, for example, a decrease in law is a movement towards anarchy. What is thereby excluded is yet another central focus for sociology of law which must problematise the relationship not only between the law and state in general but, more importantly, the relation- ship between variations in the forms of state and the associated legal systems. There are a number of other exclusions that are consequent upon the behavioral positivistic conception of law. Not only is the substantive content of rules excluded but so are all procedural characteristics of law; yet it is often by reference to procedural characteristics that problematics of the legality/illegality of official action can enter the field of scientific inquiry. [23] Additionally it should be noted that Black insists on the necessity of excluding considerations of the impact or consequences of law. The closest that he is prepared to move towards a recognition of the importance of the impact of law is to insist that it is consequent upon or secondary to the quantity of law.[24] This closure against impact considerations is a logical consquence of his methodological stance, but its implications for the sociology of law are disastrous; it is hard to envisage what would be left of such a well documented field as the investigation of the prohibition amendment or of drugs legislation or of labour relations legislation without a significant focus upon "impact". Cumulatively Black is forced by his own logic to squeeze out more and more; his programme is a prescription for the castration of the sociology of law. Law is, like all social life, located by Black in "social space": The sociological theory of law predicts and explains legal variation with its location and direction in social space.[25] It is essential to stress that the concept of "social space" is a metaphor. Indeed the history of social science abounds with the use of metaphors; they can play a helpful role in providing a language within which it is possible both to isolate distinguishable elements of social life and at the same time to formulate a relation between these elements. Spatial meta- phors of one sort or another are common as are biological metaphors (growth, flowering, etc.). It is important to recognise that the use of metaphors is inherently limited. For example, Marx made extensive use of 27</page><page sequence="10">the architectural metaphor of "base" and "superstructure"; whilst provid- ing a form in which he could "think" the relationship between more abstract concepts it becomes an impediment and leads him, partially as a consequence of the choice of the metaphor itself, towards a mechanical or reductionist formulation of the relationship between law and the mode of prodcution.[26] Metaphors should never be confused with theories; rather they are substitutes or props for the specification of complex relations, in particular they tend to import by the implications of their language particular types of causality. Black's inadvertence to the problems of his "social space" metaphor makes it necessary to explore the consequences for "The Theory". He uses it to identify social variables against which the quantitative variation of law can be measured. Thus his first variable, stratification, is endemically associated with a vertical conception of social relations (high-low, rich- poor, etc.) in both the social sciences and in common sense; its widespread use contributes nothing to making it a theoretically valuable conceptualis- ation of social relations. Yet we need to recognise exactly how difficult it is not to think of social differentiation in hierarchical terms; but the difficulty does not legitimise our linguistic conventions. This difficulty is com- pounded by Black in that stratification is reduced to positions on a linear scale. He simply makes the very conventional assumption that income differentiation is the fundamental linear scale; this rests not on scientific analysis but rather imports the ideological assumptions of economic meritocracy and non-class theories of stratification. His second variable is located on the "horizontal" spatial axis and is identified as "morphology" and defined as "the distribution of people in relation to one another".[27] Self-evidently social life is spatially dis- tributed, but it is only in the sense that we intially think of that distribution as being across the surface of the land that it appears permissible to speak of that distribution as being horizontal; in this respect the social sciences tend towards a common sense "flat earth" position. The spatial distribution automatically suggests "distance" (e.g. one aspect of the urban-rural distinction lies in the difference between physical distance and density). But Black extends the apparently unproblematic physical sense of distance with a very much broader sense of "distance" which, as a common figure of speech, refers to degrees of intimacy (e.g. "separated spouses are emo- tionally distant"). This slippage which our common-sense usage of the two senses of distance allows is unnoted by Black; but it enables him by sleight of hand to imply that intimacy permits the same type of quantification that is possible for physical distance; yet my intimate friendships may reach across the Atlantic whilst my emnity to a colleague who has the next office is in no way reduced, and may in fact be heightened, by physical proximity. "Intimacy" cannot be separated from the self-consciousness of human beings and consequently cannot, without violence to its substantive con- tent, be reduced to a behavioral and quantifiable category. 28</page><page sequence="11">The two variables which he first deploys, although allowing a common- sense vertical and horizontal space to be established, are not unproblem- atically located within the spatial metaphor. His remaining variables (culture, corporate and normative) are defined as axes within the spatial metaphor but do not lend themselves to any geometrical location and thus the metaphor becomes more attenuated and the "common-sense" of the metaphor is undermined. It is essential that social scientific classification avoids the slippage into implying a separation within the real concrete; there is no "place" where we find culture, and another where we find organisation and yet another that is the normative arena. Social science cannot by act of will alone avoid the consequences of its metaphorical language but it can and should guard against the pretence of transforming metaphors into "theory". The five major variables are clearly intended and indeed appear to embrace all social life; but on closer examination they tend to merge. As we have already seen stratification is reduced to income differentiation, morphology becomes a hierarchy of social intimacy or normality, of social statuses. Culture is reduced to a linear hierarchy of educational attain- ment; and on the way ethnocentricity is exuded in the assumption that modern societies have "more" culture than earlier social formations and additionally a common-sense sexism elevates the professor above his wife who is, of course, assumed to be a "housewife". As will be seen the hierarchy of social control becomes indistinguishable from the hierarchy of respectability. The apparently complex pattern of variables located in social space, on examination, reduces itself as a simple linear hierarchy of social statuses integrating income, conventionality, educational attain- ment, ethnocentricity, sexism and respectability; in aggregate the promise turns to the dry dust of our old and unilluminating friend, status hierarchy. Black effects a further unannounced, and possibly unrealised, slippage in the construction of "social space". Up to this point the spatial metaphor has suggested the existence of distinct "planes", one for each of his variables. But he next introduces an added radial metaphor; he refers to "radial location" and "radial direction". These concepts necessarily imply a concept of a "center" and indeed he asserts: every kind of social life has a center ... Every person and group has a location in relation to the center: each is more or less integrated.[28] Note how "center" comes by definitional fiat to stand for "integration". The startling implications of this formulation become clear when we look at his illustrative examples. "Some people work; others idle or loiter"; aside from the moralising overtones it is a clear embodiment of the most "reactionary common-sense" response which "explains" the social phenomenon of unemployment in terms of individual propensities and choice. Or again "Some marry and have children; others stay single". This assertion of the nuclear family as the "center" of social life is nothing more than a banal commonplace of romantic fiction which assumes the "natural- 29</page><page sequence="12">ness" of matrimony and applies deviant labels to those who remain outside it. The introduction of the concept of "the center" of social life introduces a semi-mystical conception of social life as having a "center" which sym- bolises the quest for the sociologists version of "the good life" embodying the maximum social integration as the nirvana towards which social life aspires; it is a manifestation of what G6ran Therborn calls the quest for "the ideological community" which has been an underlying value assump- tion of the sociological imagination.[29] Linked to the metaphor of the social "center" Black introduces concepts of "centrifugal" and "centripetal" law moving out from and into the "center of social life" (read - the well-socialised, middle-class family beloved of the makers of T.V. commercials). The penetration of conserva- tive value assumptions inherent in his concept of a "center" emerge from his discussion of vagrancy and social marginality. The marginalised are treated more harshly by police and courts. Black's claims are theoretical and included is the claim to "explanation", but it is interesting to note that we do not find him using the form of presentation "It is a fact that ..." and then "This is explained by. ..". Rather we have propositions that link, as in the example above, two variables, "law" and vagrancy. Since only two variables are cited we are left to presume an explanatory or even a causal relationship. The inference is clear, it is marginality or lack of social integration that "explains" or "causes" the harsh treatment by legal agencies. This proposition is evidenced by two citations, Marx's Capital and Chambliss on the law of vagrancy.[30] Now anyone who reads Chambliss's analysis of vagrancy legislation in England or Marx's account of the "bloody legislation against the expropriated" does not read about marginalised, isolated individuals calling down the force of law upon their own heads. Rather they encounter struggles over the level of wages, over the mobility of labour and over rural expropriation and enclosures. Neither Marx nor Chambliss can be invoked to support the view that vagrancy "caused" harsh application of law. On the contrary they argue that law not only contributed to the creation of vagrancy but also amplified it in the service of creating a new labour discipline. Again we encounter Black's contingent theory of law with its failure to accord any space to the effectivity or impact of law. Black's "explanation" is nothing more than the dressing up of the common sense "knowledge" of the dominant class of the period, echoed subsequently by apologetic historians. There is a clear political continuity in Black's "'theory" which accepts the "work shy" explanation of contemporary unemployment and his account of marginal- ised and therefore "dangerous" vagrants. The common strand is that the "victims" (unemployed or vagrant) are responsible for their condition and for the harshness of law. Reactionary prejudice is thus served up as the revelatory findings of "the sociological theory of law". Now it is probable that the liberal pose which Donald Black seeks to 30</page><page sequence="13">adopt would lead him to deny these conclusions. But to do so he would have to fall back upon an insistence that he merely records correlations (e.g. between "marginalisation" and "increased application of law"). Yet if he adopts this stance it must logically be at a very considerable price since it makes it impossible for him to advance, as he claims his theory does, any explanation of the reported phenomena. To deny the charge of "reaction- ary common sense" would require Black to abandon any claim to answer questions about why law "behaves" as it does. To do so would undermine his own claims about the importance and originality of his theory and would render its content trite and trivial. THE QUANTIFICATION OF LAW Central to the behavioral strategy is the insistence that law can and must be quantified: Law is a quantitative variable . . . The quantity of law varies in time and space.[31] Each concept in the sociological theory of law is formulated as a quantitative variable.[32] Quantification is not merely a technique for Black; it is the apotheosis of the sociological theory of law; the advent of quantification heralds a new stage of scientific development: Although the conception of law as a quantitative variable is still primitive in its formulation, with its emergence a new stage has been reached, and the study of law will never be the same. [33] In Behavior of Law Black gives a number of apparently unproblematic examples of this quantitative approach to law: A complaint to a legal official is more law than no complaint ... An arrest is more law than no arrest. An indictment is more law than none, as is a prosecution, and a serious charge is more than a minor charge.[34] At first sight this all seems self-evident; in principle quantifying law is straightforward and can be expressed as statements about "more" or "less law" and is, again in principle, capable of being given a numerical value. What is involved here is nothing more than an act of acceptance of a common-sense social evaluation of seriousness rather than an exercise in objective quantification. Some such judgments have an apparent univer- sality (e.g. an arrest is more law than no arrest) but in many fields of activity the question of ranking is disputed or contested. Take for example his assertion that "a robbery of a business is more serious than that of an individual".[35] Yet it is clear that we cannot assume such a universal ranking; it depends entirely on who makes the judgment of "seriousness". Property owners and judges may well regard business robbery as "more serious", but working people would, as the literature on "crime without victims" and crimes against organisations makes clear, probably hold the opposite view. 31</page><page sequence="14">Before we are lulled into a false sense of security and into an acceptance of his approach to the quantification of law, another of Black's examples should alert our critical faculties. In discussing the incremental scale of police activity (from complaint, police visit, report, arrest, etc.) the high point, the apex of the cumulative scale is baldly stated. "The most law the police ever apply is the taking of a person's life on their own author- ity".[36] Now we recall that Black eschews all evaluation, he notes that his writing is "intentionally bloodless in tone".[37] But the passage quoted above is not so much bloodless but rather it makes the blood run cold. Black lives and writes in a society in which police homicide in some of its cities has reached endemic proportions. It must only be the untutored cynic, unversed in the science of the behavioral sociology of law, who might protest against our bloodless scientist who refuses to distinguish between lawful and unlawful homicide, and calls police lawlessness a maximum application of law. The revealing quotation deserves a little closer examination. The sentence ends with the phrase "on their own authority"; what does this mean? Are we to take it that it seeks to exclude police homicides that are in violation of their legal authority to use reasonable force in making an arrest or that goes beyond the practice guidelines laid down in police regulations? This cannot be the intended meaning since the point of reference is to "their own" authority. There is no distinction here between "lawful" and "unlawful" police homicide; police homicide is simply the maximum application of law. We may pass over in silence the question of whether Black's methodology can permit him to make use of a value-laden concept such as "authority" in the first place. It is more important to insist that we are dealing with the same political consequences of positivism against which Radbruch protested when his fellow jurists, under the sway of positivism, could find no lack of validity in Nazi law. We should be duly warned to examine more carefully the apparently simple and unproblematic quantification of law that he proposes. Even his simple incrementalism is problematic. It appears evident that a fine of ?50 is "less law" than one of ?100; but is it so self-evident? A fine of ?100 on a corporation for environmental pollution is derisory and "less" than the ?50 fine imposed on a poor or unemployed person. Further it is not clear how we would quantify the transition in criminal sanction from fine to imprison- ment: is 30 months imprisonment more or less than a ?2,000 fine? It is not self-evident that we should accept the formal or informal tariff upon which the judges themselves rely and Black would be strident if we, like Gottfredson and Hindelang, were to suggest taking account of the sub- jective perception and ranking of sentences by defendants. (It will be necessary to return to this issue in more detail because Black in his later discussion of quantification comes full circle to adopt almost exactly this position.)[38] Similarly, we should hesitate before accepting his contention that in civil law an award of damages of ?50 is "less law" than an award of 32</page><page sequence="15">?100. We do not need to rely on the formal judicial ideology that damages are non-punitive to insist that the implied degree of liability is much more likely to be revealed in the proportion of the sum claimed that is awarded as damages. An important feature of the examples cited by Black and the issues raised in the previous paragraph are that they are all linear and incre- mental, that is, the focus is upon a graduation of police activity (from dispatch of patrol car, making a report, making an arrest, etc.). What provides the apparent quantifiability is the linear progression specified rather than anything about legal phenomena themselves. Although it is never expressly stated, there is a strong implication throughout that each incremental stage carries the same quantitative value; hence, if dispatching a patrol car is given the value of "1", then the next stage, police intervention rather than return to the station carries the value "2", etc. Why should this be so? If we assign the value "8" to making an arrest, are we to award "9" when the police gun down a fleeing suspect? Such questions are not arbitrary because we would need to be able, if quanti- fication is to have any value, to compare the amount of law applied, for example, by one officer who issues 50 speeding tickets a day with the officer who makes one homicide arrest every 3 months. The linear incremental model breaks down when we examine non-linear activity. Is a civil order to pay ?50 damages "more" or "less" law than a ?50 fine, or is it the same because the monetary value is the same? How are we to rank a civil summons for divorce on the grounds of cruelty with a criminal prosecution for assault? The general point may be made that the smaller the common-sense connection between different legal phenomena the less plausible is any attempt at rank-ordering or quantifying. Black identifies two major stages in realising quantification. The first is the creation of "ordinal measurement" which is capable of producing a ranked scale. A scale in the form x&gt;y&gt;z . . . is such a scale and this is the form that most of Black's own propositions take (e.g. an arrest is more law than a caution, etc., etc.). But as has been commented above, such a scale gives no indication of the quantitative spacing of the items; indeed unless note is taken of this problem it tends to suggest a regular linear spacing (e.g. values 1, 2, 3, etc.). The second and higher stage of quantification concerns the measurement of absolute magnitude or "interval measurement"; this Black insists is "the ultimate challenge".[39] Yet it is one that he sees as lying in the future. He is, however, anxious to widely advertise the job vacancy involved; "the invention of measurement systems present a major opportunity for those who would make a lasting contribution".[40] Black's proposal is to adopt the strategy of "indirect measurement": to measure the phenomenon in question by its relationship to another phenomenon that can more easily be observed and quantified [and] . . . that varies systematically with the magnitude of law.[41] 33</page><page sequence="16">His suggestion is to adopt as the phenomenon that can be directly measured: the tendency of people to avoid law: If we assume that people avoid law in direct relation to its magnitude, an interval scale for the measurement of law can be based upon observations of this avoidance behavior. [42] He fails to notice that this proposal is in its essence the same as that advanced a century and a half earlier by Bentham. It is a rather simple version of hedonistic calculus and is subject to precisely the same objec- tions that long ago undermined the intellectual appeal of individualistic utilitarianism and its associated calculus. There are a number of surprising and highly problematic features of this proposed method. At the outset there is no reason advanced as to why we should assume that "avoidance" is in direct relation to the magnitude of law. This proposition might constitute a hypothesis to be examined but to do so would require some independent criteria for the measurement of the magnitude of law; it cannot itself be regarded as providing the means of achieving that measurement. In addition his suggested method contradicts some of his more general methodological views. The tendency to avoid law is not self-evidently manifest in behavioral responses; whilst a suspect who runs from arrest fits the category, the businessman who takes legal advice to minimise legal liability is only incidentally avoiding law; the behavior can most directly be understood as reducing economic costs. Yet this example highlights the fundamental methodological contradiction of Black's position. These complexities are hidden by his simple imperative conception of law; if our image is of criminal law, enforced by police and backed by punitive sanctions, the "avoidance" criteria have a plausibility. This plausibility rapidly disappears when we move beyond a naive identification of "law" with "criminal law". "Avoidance" can only be understood in terms of the subjective responses of human actors, it necessarily embodies a direct approach to subjective intention. Yet he remains insistent that his theory "has nothing to do with how an individual experiences reality".[43] This remains the case even if we take cognisance of the fact that some acts we wish to classify as "avoidance" are not so conceptualised by the actors where the value-laden implications of "avoiding law" are actively denied by them; even in this case we are forced to make distinctions, which are methodologically impermissible for Black, between objective intention and the ideological or subjective accounts of actors. Whatever else may be said about "avoidance of law", and there are important issues involved, as evidenced in Macaulay's work on "avoidance" in business contracts, the problem necessitates a sociological effort to grapple with the subjective intention of human actors.[44] The promise of quantification that Black holds out in his earlier work is dashed precisely at the point when he proposes a recognisable methodo- logical strategy. Yet again we find Black incapable of remaining within the 34</page><page sequence="17">rigid positivistic requirements that he himself erects. He must be judged as providing no operational criteria for the quantification of law; since this is central to his theoretical project and pretensions it is a damning deficiency. Black has held out the promise of the quantification of law, not with the limited objective of facilitating the collection of empirical data, but with a much more important and powerful claim that it provides the means of testing theoretical propositions of the highest level of generality. The claim to offer a determinant linkage between empirical method and theoretical universality is a dazzling and attractive claim. It is therefore not surprising that others have taken up this project by seeking to "test" both the method and the hypothesis he advances. A number of research projects have been undertaken.[45] Despite significant internal differences, these projects have taken Black's claims seriously and, using related but disparate empirical data, have sought to utilise the methodology of quantification of legal phenomena to test some of the most general theoretical hypotheses that he advances. Much could be made of the fact that they all in significant degree arrive at negative conclusions about the predictive power of his hypotheses. Much also could be made of Black's complete disregard of any evidence, much that is well established in the literature, which controverts his hypotheses. His selection of "empirical" evidence to support his hypotheses is so partial that to list countervailing evidence would be a lengthy and not very valuable exercise. A more fundamental question needs to be posed: are Black's hypotheses worth testing? The discussion that follows points towards the conclusion that time and effort should not be wasted upon either testing or controverting his hypotheses. REACTIONARY COMMON SENSE The foregoing discussion has indicated that behind the scientific veneer of the "theory" lies endorsement of reactionary common sense that is not just episodic or accidental. The whole theoretical edifice is value-laden (despite the radical assertion of value freedom). Furthermore the values that emerge are consistent, they form a strand that is politically regressive that runs throughout his work. Now it should be recognised that the social sciences constantly encounter the difficulty of striving to rise beyond the common sense of the age, or seeking to do more than produce the painful elaboration of the obvious. But this generic difficulty provides little defence for Black because he claims to be aware of this problem. Indeed the main thrust of his reaction against the efforts of Gottfredson and Hindelang to test some of his major hypotheses is precisely to accuse them of being misled by common sense: common sense in sociology is a confusion of fact and value . . . [But] it is possible, however, to transcend the discourse of everyday life, and to be scientific instead of practical.[46] Yet it is precisely the failure to "transcend the discourse of everyday life", 35</page><page sequence="18">as much as the deficiencies inherent in his behaviorist methodology, that constitutes the indictment against his whole project. This section will trace the general strands of reactionary common sense that run through his writings. In "The Mobilization of Law" he identifies two alternative modes whereby "law is set in motion"; he distinguishes between "reactive mobilization" (citizen initiated) and "pro-active mobilization" (official mobilisation). The self-evident example of "reactive mobilization" is citizen initiation of civil proceedings or citizen information or complaint which is presented as "setting in motion" the criminal process by mobilising police activity. The attention and focus of the argument in the paper is upon reactive mobilisation which by the end of the paper comes to be identified with democratic law. Reactive mobilisation presumes the exist- ence of differentially available legal resources in which: a citizen-based system of mobilization operates according to the same behavioral principles as a market system of economic life.[47] It should be noted in passing that this theme is identified as "self-help", an ideologically persistent motif of the capitalist ethic despite the reality of economic and political concentration and centralisation and is returned to in one of the new essays in Manners and Customs.[48] The evaluative content obtrudes more clearly when pro-active mobilisation is discussed as: a social-welfare model of law, with legal good of the citizenry being defined and then imposed by government administrators ... a pro-active system does not merely make law available; it imposes law.[49] It follows from the logic by which this dichotomy is established that the market and reactive law are "responsive" and this is presumed to constitute a capacity to accommodate social change. On the other hand a pro-active system is an intended instrument of planned change but: the outcome is an unknown relation between the changed interests of the citizenry and the selection of cases through the initiation of the state. Where planned legal change is possible, then, there is no mechanism to learn the felt requirements of the population. Where there is such a mechanism, there is no way to plan.[50] This argument against the possibility of planned legal change is the same as that used by the ideologue of neo-conservatism Hayek.[51] All that Black does is to articulate the common sense reactionary "knowledge" of official political discourse in the United States. At its root is a conception of "democracy" or "citizen participation" founded on the assumption of atomised market behavior. The ideological or value-content of Black's position is transparent. Black goes further and explicitly adopts the "invisible hand" thesis of classical liberal political economy; its result in the field of law is that reactive or democratic law "accommodates social change by historical drift more than planned change".[52] These ideological assumptions are not merely background assumptions that can be purged from his empirical studies; they penetrate to the very 36</page><page sequence="19">core of his approach. His studies of the police start from the assumption that modern policing can be understood as reactive to citizen initiated complaints: complainants . . . are the prime movers of every legal system . . . Complainants are the most invisible and they may be the most important force binding law to other aspects of social organisation.[53] The quasi-metaphysical notion of invisible binding forces is yet another manifestation of the quest for an "essence" of social order. His police studies start from the complaints received by the police. There is no discussion of evidence which points to the police response being anything other than directly responsive to citizen complaints. Evidence is ignored that suggests that cases of sexual harassment and racist assaults are systematically ignored and not acted upon, or that experience of partisan police responses is a significant factor accounting for the pattern of complaint generation. The hypothesis that "downward law is greater than upward law",[54] leaving aside empirical evidence which contradicts the hypothesis, may well be understood and explained as the "learned conduct" (i.e. not graspable at the level of behavior) of different sections in class societies that they are able or not able to mobilise the police through mechanism of individual complaints.[55] But according to Black's account it is not the police who can be "blamed" for discriminatory responses: "A reactive system deprives state officials of the opportunity to invoke law according to their own prejudices".[56] The naivety is breath-taking! His insistence upon the lack of official discretion or discrimination manifests itself most sharply in his myopic view of the relationship between the police and racism to be discussed below.[57] His alternative account is that the initiation of law "follows the whims of the unmonitored population". It follows, according to this logic that "the possibilities of government surveillance over this kind of discrimination seem minimal".[58] Let us put this logic more sharply: discrimination in the initiation and application of law does not emanate from the police (who are rule bound officials doing a job) but from the uncontrollable prejudices and discriminations of citizens. The logic and the political implications are the same as those that, as we have seen, produced his account of unemployment and vagrancy.[59] His position comes close to a reliance on another significant example of reactionary common-sense: "You can't change human nature" It does not follow from the rejection of the thesis that discriminatory behavior emanates from citizens and not from the police, that one can simply reverse this opposition and rely on the assertion that variations in application of law can be explained as resulting solely from the police, which has tended to be an implicit assumption in many radical studies of the police. The logic of my argument applies against either such simplistic models. But having said this it should be stressed that Black's thesis is significantly more objectionable than its opposite since it renders the 37</page><page sequence="20">problem of discriminatory application a natural fact of social life from which no prescriptions about policy interventions could be made; we can only be left to wait for the long-term eradication of discriminatory attitudes and prejudices. Despite the commitment to science and to value-neutrality Black is not able to resist embarking upon some highly speculative sociologising; this indulgence in futurology is most pronounced in the final chapter of Behavior, but it has echoes and ramifications elsewhere. His general argument is that modern societies are characterised by a quantitative expansion of law; however trends can be detected which point to a quite different scenario: if the evolution of social life continues on its present course, into the indefinite future, anarchy will return.[60] and with it law will decrease. It might even disappear.[61] The argumentation for this thesis is frankly confused, resting upon unclear distinctions between "inter-dependence" and "symbiosis". He appears to have a predeliction for cyclical theories of history; and, as Eder argues, thus finds himself associated with a distinctively archaic philosophy of history. What, however, is much clearer are the social anxieties of the period to which Black lends his own peculiar voice. The "new anarchy" is the ideological anxiety of the liberal intelligensia of contemporary in- dustrial societies that is taken up and sloganised by modern conservatism: Traditional ties have been loosening, even falling apart altogether. The community is weaker than ever before, and so is the neighbourhood and family . . . Encounters replace the social structures of the past, and people increasingly have closeness without permanence, depth without commitment ... Less and less do people give their lives to organisations; in their conduct they have less and less loyalty.[63] The breakdown of community and the advance of social equality combine to produce conditions in which law will decrease in the "situational society" in which there will be no place for the rule of law and the values of liberal legalism. [64] This general scenario of the "end of community" is an example of a generalised social pessimism. However Black's pessimism is not one of unrelieved gloom; within the framework outlined there are trends to which he clearly implies a positive evaluation. Thus, for example, the short essay "On Self-Help"[65] goes as far as to "suggest several strategies by which it may be possible to increase the quantity of self-help in modern society". It is interesting to note in passing that these strategies themselves have a clearly "political" evaluation because explicitly excluded are: "strategies that would require large-scale reconstruction of society, such as those affecting the distribution of wealth".[66] Self-help is presented as self- evidently "a good thing", presumably because in various inflexions it is a component of political ideologies of both Right and Left. The definition of 38</page><page sequence="21">self-help as "any response to deviant behavior in which an offended party takes action on his or her own behalf with or without the assistance of third parties"[67] should give us cause to hesitate, because this definition clearly includes resort to private vengeance, as well as resort to private policing and vigilantism. The root of Black's positive evaluation of self-help stems from what it replaces; he exudes a clear, and politically unambiguous, anti-statism. The expansion of state and law is presented as creating a social dependency in which: the citizenry becomes increasingly dependent upon the state to define and maintain order. As this happens, people increasingly cease to take responsibility for their own security and dispute settlement, and hesitate to help others . . . Each expansion of police and other legal protection thus results in a new and higher level of need for these very services.[68] It seems clear that Black's support for self-help and for de-policing stems not from the commitment to radical social reconstruction that has motiv- ated the radical labelling theorists and criminologists in recent years, but from the conventional and regressive common-sense that plays such a dominant role in the contemporary politics of the United States. The major conclusion which these examples considered above point to is that Black fails to sustain his avowed commitment to value neutrality and his strictures against others to avoid common sense. His sociology of law is littered with the ideological common-sense of contemporary American politics with a generalised and persistent politically regressive and reaction- ary content. DONALD BLACK AND POLICE RACISM One method of penetrating the apparently highly abstracted level of theorisation of "the sociological theory of law" is to examine its application to an important and sensitive aspect of contemporary law. Throughout Black's studies of the legal process and of policing the issue of racial discrimination and police racism crops up but is, as we shall see, persist- ently suppressed. Yet the clear evidence that Black himself is uneasy about his treatment of the issue is evidenced by the fact that he found it necessary to add a postscript in 1980 to the 1971 paper "The Social Organisation of Arrest".[69] I shall address myself first to the original studies and then show that the postscript fails to come to grips with the objections that may be levelled against his treatment. Through this discussion many of the deficiencies of Black's theory discussed above are revealed. Black reports the differential arrest rates of blacks and whites from which the following conclusion is drawn: the police arrest blacks at a higher rate than whites. But no evidence is available here to support the view that the police discriminate against blacks.[70] 39</page><page sequence="22">No attempt is made to substantiate the "no evidence" assertion. Rather Black passes immediately to advance an alternative explanation: Rather the race differential seems to be a function of the relatively higher rate at which black suspects display disrespect toward the police.[71] Now we know! It is not police racism but disrespectful blacks who "cause" differential arrest rates. The logic is clear: if only the blacks would behave more respectfully they would get an equal deal from the police! "Sus- pects", he insists, "carry their fate in their own hands".[72] It entirely escapes him that blacks may be disrespectful precisely because of persistent and endemic racism exhibited by the police and the wider society over decades. The absence of any realisation of structural and historical racism and inequality testifies to the general deficiencies of behavioralism. There is something very familiar about the pattern of this argument. We have encountered it before, the work-shy cause unemployment and vagrants cause their own criminalisation. "The difference thus depends upon the [black] citizens, not the police." Indeed Black goes even further and argues that "improper or illegal behavior towards blacks does not itself constitute evidence of discrimination toward blacks".[73] He insists that this could only be ascertained in comparative studies of police illegality against blacks and whites with the variable of "disrespect towards police" held constant.[74] This is precisely the argument he advances! Once translated from the language of methodological procedures it is breath- taking. Here is the translation: even when confronted with an apparent pattern of police illegality towards blacks we must not conclude that there is evidence of police racism until we have ascertained whether when confronted with police action that blacks were "respectful" towards the police; only then would we be entitled to conclude that police racism existed. His message to the ghettoes is clear: when confronted with police illegality or harassment make sure you are respectful, if you are not you cannot shout "racism", you will have brought the consequence down upon your own heads! It should be noted in passing that these arguments are advanced against a background in which the participant observation studies on which they are based persistently record the most violent and aggressive verbal racism from the mouths of the police who are the subjects of the study, which is noted by Black without comment. It is difficult to imagine a more flagrant apologetic for police racism. If these arguments had come from the mouths of police spokesmen or politicians they would have been greeted with derision. Yet I am not aware of any commentary from sociologists that has pointed out Black's flagrant contortions to whitewash police racism. Let us now turn our attention to his 1980 postscript. It does not start very promisingly; "one subject was not adequately understood a decade ago: 40</page><page sequence="23">racial discrimination". [75] I do not know where our eminent sociologist was ten years ago; but he must have been the only person who was unaware of the mountain of evidence which pointed systematically and unambiguously towards official, and particularly police, racism. His sub- sequent comments are of the most guarded and qualified kind; "the findings . . . no longer appear sufficient to answer the question of whether police discriminate against blacks".[76] Note that there is no retraction or self-criticism of the logic of his argument but merely a loftly agnosticism, "the evidence has been strikingly inconsistent". His conclusion is a masterpiece of under-statement: during the years [since 1970] it has become clear that race is relevant to understanding the behavior of the police. Its relevance is complex, however, and not merely a matter of greater severity towards blacks.[77] If anything this postscript compounds the apologetics of his original position. Whatever else has happened in the last decade it is clear that Donald Black has learnt very little. CONCLUSION What is most striking about the results of this examination of "the sociological theory of law" is its persistent failure at a range of different levels. First, at the most immediate level of the substantive content, its propositions, despite the fanfare with which their author announces them, are little more than the repetition of sociological common-sense, whether good, bad or indifferent. His propositions exhibit a significant pattern in that they embody, behind the apparently neutral and formal language in which they are advanced, the reactionary common-sense of the age. His arguments display a particular fondness for the victim responsibility thesis that no blame must or can be attached to official behavior, rather it is people themselves, whether the unemployed, blacks or vagrants, who are responsible for the law or official behavior to which they are subject. Victim responsibility is the direct result of his behavioral methodology which abstracts the immediate interaction between officials and citizens from its historical and structural determinants. With respect to the ideologically and politically important issue of police racism his work is an undisguised apologetic. With regard to the most general and theoretical level of the claims advanced to commend "the sociological theory of law" as a major intellectual advance, we can only note its systematic failure to match its own self-advertisement. In place of the much vaunted value neutrality we find the persistence of two interconnecting value intrusions. The first stems from the logical impossibility of value exclusion; this manifests itself in the inevitable underdevelopment of Black's second axis of variation of law, the "style of law", which cannot be separated from the intrusion of teleological elements associated with human purposes and intentions. The second is the 41</page><page sequence="24">unrecognised intervention of value categories; a prime example being the impossibility of pure behaviorist treatment of "the behavior of police" without reliance upon, as a minimum, the two concepts of "police" and "citizen" which are not capable of identification in behavioral terms. The commitment to a formal positivism results in an identification of the field of inquiry of the sociology of law in such limited and barren terms that it excludes from examination much that is most significantly constitutive of law; the exclusion of large areas of civil law, of much procedural regulation and the role played by such important but problematic concepts as "due process", "legality" and "justice". Stripped of these concerns sociology of law is neutered; if we were forced to accept his truncated conception of law and the associated problematics for the sociology of law we would be turning the clock back to the limited horizons of nineteenth century imperative jurisprudence, the struggle against which has been the very genesis and raison d'etre of the sociological movement in law.[78] The project of a behavioral theory of law is fundamentally deficient since the conception of "behavior" is both theoretically and methodologically flawed. It is incapable of conceptual coherence save at the price of exclusion of all that is most pertinent. It is most starkly marked by its inability to distinguish between the legal and the illegal "behavior" of state officials. These deficiencies are compounded by the failure of his theory to quantify beyond the most primitive, and consequentially distorting, man- ner the variation in legal phenomena. Any attraction that the prospect of quantification holds out is shattered by the inescapable logic which leads Black to identify police homicide as the maximum application of law. All that remains on offer from the great edifice of "the sociological theory of law" advanced by Black is a miscellany of the self-evident, interspersed with the politically loaded prejudices of reactionary common- sense. What remains to be understood is why such a "theory" which is so decisively deficient should have in any significant degree been taken up by others and subjected to empirical testing.[79] It is apparent that it is the claim to empirical operationalisation and testability that has been the motivating force. None of these attempts at empirical validation, despite the varying degrees of their methodological sophistication give anything more than the most cursory glance to the theoretical and methodological edifice that they seek to scrutinise. The persistent and powerful grip of the empiricist tradition and ideology within the sociology of law underlies the response which takes seriously and as being worthy of testing the insub- stantial, incoherent and regressive reality of "the sociological theory of law" which amounts to nothing more than a cul-de-sac in the development of sociology of law.

[12] This should not be taken to mean that in a theoretically coherent sociology of law a typology of styles of law cannot have an important place; indeed such conceptualisations play a major part in the sociology of law of both Durkheim and Weber, but their typological construction is more rigorously derived in accordance with explicit method- ologies. [13] Further the quest for quantification is not abandoned. In the appendix on measurement he refers to the possibility that "a scale might be developed for each style of law as well" (p. 212). He suggests, for example, that in the case of the conciliatory style passive mediation would rank as "less law" than active arbitration. [14] Black goes to great pains to stress his radical epistemological scepticism of all that is not reducible to behavioral facts. He cites the example of "art" and insists that something may only be known as "art" because it is exhibited in galleries, purchased in the market and taught in universities. The logic of such a position is that the work of Cezanne, Gauguin, or Soutine, who found little recognition during their lives, only became "art" when the dealers and museum directors chose to recognise it as such, or when taken up by galleries or by university academics.

Such a line of argument, as Dworkin for example shows is problematic in Taking Rights Seriously (1978), but Black makes no attempt to consider such objections nor show that he is aware of significant objections to his imperative conception of law. [23] The problematic of legality/illegality would only be possible on other grounds that took the form of either a natural law theory or one dependent on some version of a distinct theory of justice. [24] Op. cit., supra n. 3, p. 214. [25] Ibid., p. 3. [26] For discussion of the consequences of Marx's base-superstructure metaphor for his theory of law see M. Cain and A. Hunt, Marx and Engels on Law (1979). [27] Op. cit., supra n. 15, p. 37. The sociological use of the concept morphology has an interesting history; it has been borrowed from biology where its essential reference was to the variation of forms of organisms. But we find Durkheim using it in a much more naturalistic sense to refer to spatial distribution of population, climatic and geological conditions. Black uses it in this sense and also in an alternative manner because of the dual meaning he attaches to "distance". [28] Ibid., p. 48. [29] G. Therborn, Science, Class and Society (1976). [30] W.

Note the similarity between this method and that pursued, on the same criteria, by Durkheim in using the variation in law as an index of the variation of social solidarity. 44</page><page sequence="27">[43] Op. cit., supra n. 15, p. 7.

In passing it may be commented that there is a certain similarity between Black's application of economic quantification and the fashionable "law and economics" movement associated with Posner and others. It is not the intention in this essay to explore this possible intellectual and methodological continuity; however if such a connection exists it should be borne in mind that the critique of the "law and economics" school by Arthur Leff and others can be relevantly applied to Black.

[55] For example, it follows from his proposition that comparing police encounters with black and white juveniles it would be predictable that arrest rate should be highest for blacks; James Q. Wilson comparative study found evidence inconsistent with Black's thesis, "The Police and Delinquents in Two Cities" in Wheeler (ed.) Controlling Delinquents (1968). [56] Op. cit., supra n. 3, p. 57.

[64] I have argued that there is a significant parallel between the inherent pessimism in Black's scenario of the modern world and that arrived at by an entirely different route by Roberto Unger. A.

It is interesting to note that in support of this line of argument Black quotes 45</page><page sequence="28">from the anarchist theorist Kropotkin. Elsewhere he also cites Engels in support of his cyclical historical scenario. It is not clear how these "radical" citations are meant to be taken because there is no evidence that Black supports the political conclusions which such authors draw; it suggests that it is necessary to insist that a simple and direct ascription of neo-liberal and neo-conservative positions to Black should be avoided. Yet the overall evaluation is that any potentially radical implications present in Black's work are nullified and buried within "reactionary common-sense" which prevails in his writing. [69] D.
