Marilin Calo Received: 15 June 2012 /Accepted: 29 May 2013 /Published online: 18 June 2013 © Springer- Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013 Abstract This paper explores food and daily activities in domestic areas at the archaeological site of Cardonal, Provincia de Catamarca, Argentina. It is based on archaeo- botanical carpological macro remains recovered by flota- tion techniques in a residential compound. A set of five taxa including wild plants such as Geofflroea decorticans (chañar), Phaseolus vulgaris var. aborigineus (wild bean), Prosopis sp. (i algarrobo ) and the crops P. vulgaris var. vulgaris (domesticated bean) and Zea mays (maize) were identified. These well-known staples of ancient communi- ties in this area suggest that the Cardonal people combined agriculture with foraging practices, taking advantage of a diversified environment and extensive social networks. The most abundant plant food remains were bean cotyledons and maize cupules, which were densely concentrated in the "kitchen", near the hearth. Conversely, chañar endocarps, algarrobo seeds and also Chenopodium sp. seeds were almost exclusively confined to the "patio", in the hearth area. As a result, two distinct food-related activity areas could be identified, defined by the relative density of plant remains, occurrence of plant taxa and the different prac- tices of processing and consumption which they evoke.

Ambrosetti", Universidad de Buenos Aires, Moreno 350, Buenos Aires, Argentina e-mail: marilincalo@gmail.com Introduction This study focuses on the archaeobotanical analysis carried out on the archaeological site of Cardonal, a 2,000 year old village located in the southern portion of the valle de Cajón (La Quebrada, Departamento de Santa María, Provincia de Catamarca, Argentina; 26°41'13.29" S and 66°27/29.97// W). The site has been subjected to intensive studies since 2004, and it is considered of particular importance in view of its privileged geographical setting along a natural route connecting the Puna and Yungas territories. As a whole, the Puna (dry highlands), the valleys (arid valleys and sierra) and the Yungas (the rainforests on the eastern slope of the Andes) are particular geographical elements of North- western Argentina (NWA), and these are thought to have been of fundamental social and economic relevance during pre-Hispanic times. Indeed, there is a good deal of evidence for the extensive circulation of exotic goods and staples among communities settled on the Pacific coast of northern Chile, the Puna, the valleys, and the eastern forests in this Andean geographic sector since very ancient times (Albeck 1994; Lazzari 2005; Nuñez and Dillehay 1979). In this regard, Cardonal has been mentioned as a remarkable example of the first sedentary agricultural communities belonging to the Formative Period in the social development of northwest Argentina (Fig. 1). This period has been often characterised as one in which, from c. 1500 b.c. to a.D. 600, segmentary groups with little social hierarchy inhabited the landscape in a dispersed settlement pattern of sparse domestic and productive units, based on the requirements of a mixed economy subsistence system including agriculture, hunting and herding (Olivera 2001; Scattolin 2006; Tarrago 1992). Additionally, cultivation of edible plants such as Zea mays L. (maize), Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean), Arachis hypogaea L.

(quinoa) and vari- ous Cucurbita L. squash taxa, was complemented by for- aging activities, which also provided wild items such as several species of Prosopis L. (algarrobo), Geoffroea decorticans (Gillies ex Hook and Arn.) Burkart (chañar) and Ziziphus mistol Griseb. (mistoï) fruits (Tarrago 1980; Carrizo et al. 2003; Korstanje 2001; Oliszewski 2005; Pochettino and Scattolin 1991). It should be noted here that although these Formative communities were involved in dynamic social interactions for the distribution and exchange of local products on a regional scale, as men- tioned above, they remained mostly self-sufficient. By the end of the Formative Period, between a.D. 600 and 1000, evidence of Tiwanaku civilization expansion reached southern Bolivia and possibly northwest Argentina as well (González 1998). Villages continued to have a dispersed pattern, but were slightly denser. The building of ceremonial or non-domestic structures continued during these later centuries, but they became larger and were made up of multiple rooms (Gordillo 2009). In the subsequent Late Period (c. a.d. 1000-1436), highly hierarchical soci- eties maintained clear-cut territorial boundaries through the political control of other ecological areas, agglomerated settlements and warfare. The density and arrangement of structures in this period clearly show that larger numbers of people inhabited these villages, while their defensive sit- uation is shown by the placement of pukaras (fortresses) on hilltops (Nielsen 1996; Tarrago 2000). Afterwards, this area became part of the Inka Empire for a short period of time until the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. Inka architecture followed a very distinctive pattern that was transferred to the conquered areas as a way of control and domination (Cremonte and Williams 2007). Although other Formative Period villages in the valle del Cajón such as Yutopian (Gero and Scattolin 2002) and Bordo Marciai (Scattolin et al. 2009b) have also been investigated, Cardonal stands out as the only one where a residential compound (CI) has been fully excavated (Scattolin et al. 2009a; Gero 2004), which has enabled the design and application of a sediment sampling for flotation plan which covered the whole domestic complex, and pro- vided the plant remains which are the main subject of this paper. The major objectives of the research were to identify fruits and seed taxa present in the occupation floors and to associate food-related activities and domestic areas. This work contributes to the understanding of domestic life and subsistence in Cardonal and other ancient dwelling contexts in the valle del Cajón through a detailed, contextual analysis of food acquisition, processing and consumption practices, providing much-needed comparative data to understand these practices in comparable contexts across the region. A house in a village Cardonal is located on a somewhat steep slope at 3,000 m a.s.l. It consists of ~ 100 circular or sub circular structures arranged in groups, which are thought to have been resi- dential compounds. A number of larger structures possibly used as barnyards could be seen in the upper part of the village, while crop fields and irrigation systems could be observed in the nearby slopes and hills. Two cemetery areas were detected to the north and east of Cardonal (Fig. 2). The residential compound CI is a very well preserved archaeological context where several domestic activities have been identified, many of which are related to food processing and consumption. It consists of five adjacent and interconnected structures (SI, S2, S3, S4 and S5).

The bedrock was excavated to enclose each room, while large stones were used to build up the walls on the perimeter. Smaller stones were placed in between the larger stones and adobe bricks probably completed the walls up to the roof. The latter was supported by wooden posts fitted into post-holes which were present in all room floors. Some pits of yet unclear specific function were found all over the house, two of them containing white lime-sandy sedi- ments, ashes and polished stones (Fig. 3). Statistically identical radiocarbon dates from each room suggest that the Cardonal house was inhabited during the first two centuries of the Christian era (Table 1; Scattolin et al. 2009a). Recovered objects and materials include fine and ordinary ceramic fragments (Bugliani et al. 2010; Scattolin et al. 2009a, b, projectile points and lithic knapping debris (Cattaneo and Oliva Bustamante 2008), grinding stones, charred seeds and fruits (Calo 2010), camelid (llama), deer (taruca) and armadillo (quirquincho) bones and some bone instruments (Izeta 2007) and basketry imprints (Calo 2008). Finds in SI provided clear evidence of an ancient food cooking context or "kitchen". A well-preserved hearth consisting of three round stones linked by an annular ring of baked clay containing abundant charcoal remains was sit- uated next to the entrance. The floor of the room was completely impregnated with soot and contained a great number of bone fragments and some charred beans.

Two cortarias, passive grinding tools, one of them of large dimensions, a flat grinding stone and eight manos , active grinding tools, were found next to the wall, this being the most defined milling area in CI. Finally, a fragmented ceramic pipe, which contained vestiges of a psychotropic substance, indicates that the CI context would have combined food related activities with other practices (Calo et al. 2012). Charcoal and soot in S2 seemed to belong to a disused hearth beside the door. There were two large jars, probably used for cooking or storage, as well as other vessels with finer finishes. Lithic material included knapping debris and a good number of tools, such as six obsidian projectile points. Faunai remains included a great number of fragmented bones, some of which showed signs of having been burnt or worked in some way. There were some manos scattered on the floor of this room. Several mud fragments with coiled basketry base imprints and a probable coarse blanket were also found. The particular composition and arrangement of artefacts allowed interpretation of S2 as a store room for various objects and products and possibly a place for making stone tools. Room S3 together with Dw were proposed as "transit areas", because walking through them was unavoidable to reach the other rooms. Indeed, several active and passive milling stones were found in the S3 floor, many of which were arranged next to the wall, worn-out and probably discarded. An obsidian projectile point and a fragmented pot were also recovered in S3. The smallest room of the compound, S4, contained a small number of manos , a projectile point and a bone instrument. Finally, S5 was defined as a semi-thatched "patio" where food preparation and cooking activities also took place. A dispersed hearth area was identified at the end of &amp; Springer</page><page sequence="4">580 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2014) 23:577-590 an inner semi-circular, concentric wall or "bench" (Fig. 3). Moreover, charcoal and burned camelid bones were recovered from the greasy sediments around the hearth. An anthropomorphic ceramic vessel was also found next to it. A conana and a flat grinding stone with several manos were organized in a second milling area, next to the hearth. The plant world around Cardonal The valle del Cajón is a wide valley basin, extending for 90 km in a northwest to southeast direction, and ranging from 4,200 to 2,200 m a.s.l. It has a temperate-warm semiarid climate with scarce summer rains. The vegetation cover can be described in four successive phytogeographic units known as Altoandina (&gt;3,700 m a.s.l.), Puna (3,700-3,000 ma.s.1.), Prepuna (3,000-2,000 m a.s.l.) and Monte (&lt;2,000 m a.s.l.) vegetational provinces (Fig. 4; Morlans 1995). The Altoandina vegetation province is a rough yellowish grass steppe present on high summits and slopes. It gradually changes to the Puna, where spiny shrubs and grasses are abundant. In its highest portion, the Puna landscape is sprinkled by well-delimited damp areas of soil known as vegas or ciénagos , with a dense carpet of green Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Caryophyllaceae (Morlans 1995). The ancient village of Cardonal is positioned in the first portion of the Prepuna province. Big columnar Cactaceae and Brome- liaceae populations are characteristic of this environment, Fig. 4 Phytogeographical provinces in valle del Cajón. White circles represent relevant reference localities while large areas are covered by grasses and shrubs of open land (Cabrera 1976). Certainly, several shrubs such as Flourensia DC., Baccharis L., Cyclolepis D. Don, Chuquiraga Juss. and Senecio L. are plentiful in the La Quebrada and Cardonal areas (Calo and Pereyra Domingorena 2013). Towards the southeast, Monte province includes the lower land bordering the rivers Totoral and Cerro Colorado and extending into the Campo del Arenal plains, in which there is a wooded area where Prosopis spp. and G. decorticans grow together with other trees and bushes (Morlans 1995). Materials and methods In order to recover plant remains, sediments were sampled from each room, including excavation units in occupation floors, fill levels and architectural features. In all, 171 (1,026 1) "scatter samples" (sensu Lennstrom and Hastorf 1992, pp 302-303) were floated using a non-mechanized flotation system (Table 2). Some units in the southern and eastern sectors of SI were not included in this study, as they had been previously excavated. For each sample, light and heavy fractions were separated, using two Macotest ASTM E- 1 1 sieves with meshes of 2.0 and 0.8 mm. The sieved sub- fractions were examined separately with a Wild M5 binoc- ular microscope with a lOx eyepiece and 6x, 12x, 25x, 50 X objective lenses. Finally, recovered remains were drawn using a drawing tube attached to the microscope. Plant specimens gathered in situ were also considered for analysis. For taxonomical identification purposes, the plant remains were examined in accordance with the following variables: state (complete, semi-complete or fragmented), plant organ or tissue present (fruit, stone, endocarp, mesocarp, epicarp, grain, seed, cotyledon or stem), dia- gnostic morphological and morphometric characters (for variables used, see below under taxa descriptions). Derived values were compared with modern and archaeological reference specimens and others were referred to in biblio- graphic illustrated works (for citations, see below in taxa descriptions). Additionally, taxa descriptions were com- plemented with botanical, ecological and ethnographic information from specialized literature.

Absolute quantities and relative percentages of each taxon were used to estimate their relative representation in CI. Then, density values for the plant remains were estimated for the rooms and features in order to compare their presence and distribution in the house. This method enabled the differentiation of areas where food related activities could have occurred, as well as the integration of systematic archaeobotanical data relevant to past daily practices at the Cardonal site. Taxonomie identifications A total of 10,632 charred plant remains were obtained from the floated samples. This collection includes seed remains (n - 215) and wood (n = 10,382), as well as a further 35 seeds and fruits recovered in situ. Summarizing, a total of 250 charred plant remains represented by seeds, cotyledons, grains, peri- carps and endocarps were identified from the Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Solanaceae and Poaceae families. Chenopodiaceae A first group includes five complete lenticular shaped seeds. The smooth testa can be seen in four of them, but a reticulate pericarp covers the fifth example. Margins are either truncate or rounded but never wavy. Sizes range between 1 .0-1 .2 mm length and 0.8-1 . 1 mm width. The radicle protrudes from the edge. These characters are compatible with descriptions of Chenopodium L. by Bruno (2005, 2006), Bruno and Whitehead (2003), Gallardo et al. (1997) and Planchuelo (1975), and they are also comparable to modern reference seeds. Archaeological seeds share attributes with Chenopo- dium quinoa Willd. (quinoa) and C. pallidicaule Aellen ( cañigua ) specimens described by Bruno (2005) in Bolivia, as well as with C. pallidicaule studied by Planchuelo (1975) in northwest Argentina. However, the profusion of wild Chenopodium spp. plants growing in a large area around Cardonal made species identification very difficult in the archaeological examples (Fig. 5a, b). A second group of 12 seeds whose sizes range between 1.4 and 0.7 mm length shows porous and shining surfaces, fractures and loss of material. Size and circular contour can be associated with small seeds of Chenopodiaceae, but their spherical shape with noticeable concave margins can be compared with experimentally modified Chenopodium sp. seeds. Indeed, as modern examples are boiled and then charred, they become globose and with grooves, making them comparable to the archaeobotanical specimens men- tioned above (Fig. 5c). Fabaceae Caesalpinioideae: Two cotyledons and a complete seed, 1.5 and 1.1 mm in length and 1.0 mm in width, were exam- ined. They have an oval flattened shape, smooth and glossy surfaces and apical hilum. No fissure line was observed. According to these characteristics, seeds were assigned to Caesalpinioideae based on Boelcke' s Fabaceae Sub-fami- lies differentiation (Boelcke 1946). Mimosoideae: Six fragmented specimens less than 3.5 mm in length show a portion of fissure line next to the seed's margin. Although their poor preservation state does not allow other characteristic features to be seen, the fissure line allows identification of these seeds as being within the Mimosoideae sub-family, as characterized by Boelcke (1946). Mimosoideae; Prosopis sp.: The single example was oval to oblong in shape with a rounded chalaza and radicle extremities. Seed dimensions were 3.9 mm length and 2.5 mm width, although most probably these measurements underestimate the real size, as margins and most of the internal structures are absent. In frontal view, a wide horse- shoe shaped fissure line could be observed. It was centred and occupied more than three-quarters of the surface. Based on this last trait and general morphology, the specimen could be attributed to Prosopis chilensis (Molina) Stuntz ( Chilean algarrobo) or P. alba Griseb. (white algarrobo) as described in Boelcke (1946) and Burkart (1952) respectively (Fig. 5d). Papilionoideae; Geoffroea decorticans : Two complete fusiform-navicular shaped seeds with noticeably grooved surfaces were examined. Their measurements are 9.5 mm length, 4.0 mm width and 10.5 mm length, 5.0 mm width, respectively, with a lateral hilum. Both examples were identified as G. decorticans (chañar) seeds according to the features described by Burkart (1952). Another 15 frag- mented endocarps with an average length of 7.0 mm were assigned to the same taxon. They are flattened and curved structures with a grooved internal surface (Fig. 5f). Papilionoideae; Phaseolus sp.: A total of 25 fragmented specimens are included in this group, with sizes ranging between 6.0-3.0 mm length, 7.2-2.5 mm width and 2.0-3.5 mm thickness. Some of them are elliptical and reniform in shape. Most of them are flat and oblong or semi- oval in transverse section. All surfaces are smooth and no hilum or radicle mark was observed in apical fragments. The features of the fragments are similar to those mentioned by Burkart (1952) and Babot et al. (2007) for Phaseolus genera. Papilionoideae; Phaseolus vulgaris L ; P. v. var. vulgaris ; P. v. var. aborigineus (Burkart) Baudet: In all, 23 cotyle- dons with laterally positioned hilum and smooth surface were examined.

The length/width indices (L/W) range from 1 .47 to 1 .86 mm corresponding to elliptical, spherical and oblong shapes (sensu Lema 2009). The L/W index is used to describe archaeological bean shapes in northwest Argentina: elliptical (1.43-1.65), spherical (1.16-1.42) and oblong (short: 1.66-1.85; medium: 1.86-2; long: 2 or more) (Lema 2009). A few examples have angular contours but most of them are rounded. All mentioned features are characteristic of P . vulgaris (common bean) as described by Burkart (1952). Simultaneously, two groups of cotyledons based on size ranges were distinguished. The first one mainly comprises oblong specimens smaller than 8.0 mm length and 5.0 mm width. A second group includes cotyledons greater than 9.0 mm length and 5.5 mm width and mainly with an elliptic shape. Only one spherical-shaped specimen was identified among the smallest examples of this last group (Fig. 6). Because general shape and size are both variables commonly used to distinguish domesticated and wild forms of beans (Lema 2009; Babot et al. 2007; Oliszewski 2005), the analyzed examples were compared with values from reference specimens (Table 3; Fig. 6). This chart indicates that all the Cardonal specimens fall outside the ranges of modern bean seeds in this area, which were obtained by Lema (2009), Oliszewski (2004) and Babot et al. (2007). By contrast, if we take into account the size ranges of the archaeological beans recovered and identified from Campo del Pucará (Provincia de Catamarca, Argentina) by Oliszewski (2004, 2005), their values are generally lower Springer</page><page sequence="7">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2014) 23:577-590 583 Fig. 6 P. v. var. aborigineus and P. v. var. vulgaris size ranges for NWA specimens and size values obtained from CI beans than those of modern specimens, and more similar to the archaeological examples from Cardonal. The observed size tendency probably correlates with carbonization effects or other chemical, mechanical or cultural agents (Johannessen et al. 1990; Stewart and Robertson 1971). Changes produced by natural hybridisation (Freyre et al. 1996), geographical isolation (Galvan et al. 2010) or domestica- tion processes (Berglund-Brücher and Brücher 1976; Gepts and Debouck 1991) should be also considered. Neverthe- less, when the L/W index is applied to cotyledons studied by Oliszewski (2005), elliptic and oblong shapes correlate to domesticated specimens, while the spherical shape group was seen in wild specimens. These results resemble those expected for the classification of modern material in Lema (2009), but differ from the prevailing oblong forms in the wild bean group from Cardonal. In conclusion, the characteristics mentioned above allow us to distinguish a group of seven examples corresponding to P. v. var. aborigineus (wild beans) and another group consisting of nine cotyledons of P. v. var. vulgaris (domes- ticated beans) (Fig. 5g, h, i). The remaining seven Phaseolus sp. fragments could not be associated with either of them. Malvaceae There is only one complete seed, rounded to kidney- shaped. It measures 1.2 mm length and 1.1 mm width. Its extremes are acute and rounded, respectively. While its outer edge is thick, its internal edge is thin. This particular shape suggests a curved embryo. Its general morphology approximates to that described by Martin and Barkley (2000) for Malvaceae seeds (Fig. 5j). Solanaceae: Solanoideae A semi-complete seed was recovered. It is lenticular in shape, slightly compressed toward its centre and is 1.3 mm in diameter. The testa surface is rough, the edge has an irregular contour and the radicle protrudes from it. The spiral embryo and radicle can be observed inside the seed. All these features are consistent with the descriptions of Solanoideae seeds, especially to those ascribed to Solanum L. or Capsicum L. (Fig. 5 k; Hunziker (1969, 1979, 2001)). Poaceae: Zea mays L.

All speci- mens are longer (3.8-5.0 mm) than they are wide (2.5-3.5 mm) (Fig. 51). Cupules A total of 43 complete, semi-complete and fragmented examples of deep hollow-shaped cupules were analyzed. Their sizes vary between 4.65-3.12 mm (3.85 mm average) length and 5.92-4.5 mm (5.16 mm average) width (Fig. 5m, n, o). Both types of remains are from maize spikes, particularly those characterized by pop and small grains with a hard endosperm, which have been found in pre-Hispanic and modern maize from this area, as mentioned in Oliszewski (2008). Based on such classifications of modern and pre- Hispanic maize from northwest Argentina by Parodi (1959) and Abiusso and Camara Hernandez (1974), Oliszewski (2008) proposes to group them into three large clusters so as to include (a) early ripening maize with hard and popcorn grains, (b) early or late ripening maize with soft and floury grains and (c) late ripening maize with sweet and soft grains. Other remains Type 1 seeds This group includes complete and semi-com- plete seeds less than 2.0 mm in length. They range from inverted cone to pear-shaped with a smooth surface (Fig. 7a). Type 2 seeds It includes nine complete, semi-complete and fragmentary examples. Their sizes range between 3.0-1.9 mm length and 2.6-1.1 mm width. They are ob- conic in shape with a slightly rough surface (Fig. 7b, c, d). Type 3 seeds These are four complete and fragmented lenticular seeds smaller than 2.0 mm. They have a reticu- late seed coat and two of them show humps (Fig. 7e). Type 4 seeds This group includes five elongate to fusi- form (spindle-shaped) seeds, with smooth surfaces. Their size varies from 1.8 to 2.5 mm in length and from 1.0 to 1.1 mm width (Fig. 7f, g). Type 5 pericarps A heterogeneous group of 12 frag- mented stiff pericarps were separated, based on their hol- lowed, concave shape. Sizes vary and include examples from 1.5 to 4.5 mm in length (Fig. 7h, i). Type 6 stems This group consists of eight elongated cylindrical structures. Two of them show internodes and calyx is present in other examples (Fig. 7j, k, 1). Quantitative and distributional analysis of the archaeobotanical collection The absolute quantity and percentage data of all taxa iden- tified in the CI archaeobotanical collection are summarized in ESM 1 and Fig. 8. Bean cotyledons (n = 52; 20.8 %) and maize cupules ( n = 43; 17.2 %) are the most abundant specimens, followed by Chenopodium sp. seeds (n = 17; 6.8 %) and G. decorticans endocarps (n = 16; 6.4 %). Comparatively, the small seeds classified into Types 1-6 are very well represented when considered as a group (n = 26; 10.4 %). On the other hand, poorly preserved plant remains which could not be assigned to any taxa (n = 57; 22.8 %) are included in the CI collection as not identified (NI). Comparison of absolute quantities among rooms showed that most of the archaeological plant remains derive from S 1 and S5, while only a few are from Dw. On the other hand, S2, S3 and S4 have intermediate amounts of archaeobotanical remains, noticeably fewer than the ones mentioned above. Taxa percentage contribution in every room shows that almost 90 % of the archaeobotanical remains in SI are maize cupules and bean cotyledons, whereas Chenopodium sp. seeds (22 %) and G. decorticans endocarps (13 %) are well represented in S5, in a similar proportion to weed seeds, pericarps and stems as a whole. By contrast, small seeds and pericarps (55 %) dominate the group in S2, where G. decorticans is present in a low proportion (10 %). A similar situation can be observed in S3 and S4, although G. decorticans and unidentified remains percentages are higher in S3. Beans (8 %) and maize (8 %) are also repre- sented in S4. Lastly, equal proportions of Z mays and small seeds are present in the Dw sediments (50 %) (Fig. 8). To sum up, all maize cupules come from SI, but a few maize grains are present in S4, S5 and Dw. A number of complete and fragmented wild and domesticated bean cotyledons and other beans came from SI as well. Other bean cotyledons and another corn cupule were scattered in S3, S5 and S4. Fragments of Mimosoideae seeds appear in SI and S2 but Prosopis sp. only appears in S5. Complete seeds of G. decorticans are present in S2. Endocarps of this species are concentrated in S5, yet they also appear in S3 and S2 in smaller proportions. Finally, all Chenopodium sp. seeds come from S5 sediments (Fig. 9). As a whole, CI density is 0.21 plant remains per litre of floated sediment (n/1), which includes only remains recov- ered by flotation. The lowest densities are found in Dw (0.03 n/1) and S4 (0.08 n/1), while intermediate values correspond to S2 (0.13 n/1), S3 (0.16 n/1) and S5 (0.13 n/1). The room with the greatest density of remains is SI (4.94 n/1), but it is of fundamental importance to acknowledge that this result might be affected by the fact that this room was only partially excavated by our team and the analyzed samples might not be representative of the entire structure (see methods and techniques). In this sense, the delimitation and analysis of material from small spatial areas in each room can help minimize this bias, while revealing distributional variability of botanical remains in every room. Indeed, ESM 2/Fig. 10 considers hearths, post-holes, pits, floors, blackened sediments in floors and fill sediments as spatial units to compare densities of plant remains. It shows that the SI blackened floor area has the highest Springer</page><page sequence="9">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2014) 23:577-590 585 Fig. 7 Seeds (a), Type 1 (b-d), Type 2 (e), Type 3 (f-g), Type 4 (h-i), pericarps (j-1), stems Fig. 8 Absolute quantities and relative percentages of plant remains density when compared to blackened floor areas in S2, S3 and S4 or the hearth area in S5. Nevertheless, the SI floor area and S5 hearth also include notable amounts of remains in situ (the highest of the compound). The occupation floor in S5 has the greatest density (0.19 n/1), followed by S4 (0. 14 n/1), S2 (0. 1 1 n/1), S3 (0. 1 1 n/1) and the Dw (0.08 n/1). Except the Dw, pits in general contain plant remains, and their density values are slightly higher than those from room floors. Moreover, remains from the 'bench' which internally contours S5 are present, although at a lower density (0.06 n/1). Finally, archaeobotanical specimens were also identified from within fill levels, notably in S2 (0.23 n/1) (Fig. 10).

Domesticated and wild beans, maize, algar- robo and chañar have been found in several Formative sites in northwest Argentina, most of which were associ- ated with food production, preparation and consumption contexts. These plants still continue to have relevance for local communities at present, as numerous ethnographic and ethnobotanical studies have shown. Both varieties of common beans are present in the area. Wild beans naturally grow in the humid eastern Andean valleys below 2,800 m a.s.l. They are particularly abundant on the eastern slope of the Aconquija mountain range, Provincia de Tucumán, Argentina (Berglund-Briicher and Brücher 1976). On the other hand, the best conditions for domesticated bean crops can be found between 0 and 2,000 m a.s.1., but they can also grow in some sheltered places up to 3,500 m a.s.l. (Tapia 1990). Wild bean plants have been found alongside domesticated beans in crop fields (Freyre et al. 1996; Lema 2009), a situation that enables natural hybridisation (Gepts and Debouck 1991). Seeds and immature pods of both bean varieties are used in soups today (Burkart 1952; Horkheimer 1990). Maize is considered to be a domesticated plant in northwest Argentina, since no wild ancestor has been identified in the area to date. Nevertheless, a good number of authors argue that maize was the main crop in pre- Hispanic Andean agriculture as well as an essential com- ponent of meals (Gonzalez and Pérez 1968; Oliszewski 2005; Parodi 1959; Tarrago 1980). At present, maize grows best in areas located below 2,000 m a.s.l., but archaeo- botanical remains found in various pre-Hispanic agrarian villages suggest that it could have been grown at over 3,000 m a.s.l. (Babot 2006; Haber 1999; Rodríguez 2004). These high altitude resistant plants might correspond to an early ripening maize characterized by small and pop grains with hard endosperm, similar to those identified in CI. Ground, toasted, boiled, popped or fermented maize grains can be used to prepare various traditional Andean dishes and drinks such as mazamorra , humita and chicha and they are sometimes eaten without a second procedure being required (popcorn, choclo etc.). Algarrobo and chañar are two widely distributed trees in lower areas and both continue to be appreciated as a wild resource by local people. Nowadays, therapeutic sub- stances, dye, fuel, wood and food products are obtained from Prosopis spp. and G. decorticans . Fermented and soft drinks (aloja and añapa , respectively), jams and syrups (arropé), and flour for bread and cakes (patay ) are made using the fleshy parts (mesocarp) of algarrobo pods and chañar fruits (Burkart 1952; Capparelli 2007; Figueroa and Dantas 2006; Ragonese and Martinez Crovetto 1947).

As for quinoa or cañigua seeds, they were identified in a few Formative sites in northwest Argentina (Korstanje 2001; Oliszewski and Olivera 2009; Tarrago 1980). Chenopodium spp. seeds can be eaten boiled in potages and soups, toasted and ground to obtain flour which is used to prepare bread, and also fermented in various Andean drinks. At present, several wild Chenopodium spp. grow in the area and many of them are highly appreciated by the local population because of their therapeutic and aromatic properties. Also, cañigua (possibly present in CI) has been registered as a ruderal and spontaneous plant while grow- ing under cultivation in Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador (Plan- chuelo 1975; Bruno 2006). Unlike in other Andean countries, cultivation and consumption of all domesticated Chenopodium spp. practically disappeared from Argentina by early in the 20th century (Hunziker 1952; Parodi 1966). The latter author suggests that well before this date, quinoa crops must have been conspicuous in the Atacama Puna, the Calchaqui valleys area, and in most of the northwest Argentine pre-Andean ravines, especially in high altitude zones where maize cannot grow. Conclusions The distribution of seeds and fruits in CI suggests that preparation and also probably food consumption occurred in specific areas of the house. Traces of these activities were mostly found near the hearths in both SI and S5, where the density and variability of plant remains increased. On the other hand, activities like sweeping or circulation could have dispersed charred seeds to other rooms or out of the house. In the case of maize, for example, no grains appeared in association with hearths, while very small quantities of them were found in other rooms where this feature was absent. Sweeping as well as other domestic tasks make the estimation of the relative importance of maize in the diet of the people living at Cardonal difficult, on the basis of the evidence available to date. At the same time, activities related to food preparation and cooking might have modified the amount of archaeo- botanical evidence at the site. For example, maize grains might have had fewer opportunities to become exposed to fire in hearths (and thus preserved) because they were most probably ground or/and fermented before consumption as flour or alcoholic drinks, without being previously popped or toasted. Meanwhile, charred bean cotyledons are represen- tative of discarded or accidentally non-consumed examples, Springer</page><page sequence="12">588 Veget Hist Archaeobot (2014) 23:577-590 presumably because they fell into the hearth while being boiled. On the other hand, since endocarps and seeds of chañar and algarrobo in S5 represent the non-edible parts of fruits, they probably were intentionally discarded. Maize cupules, the disposable part of the ear, might also have been used as fuel in a more or less systematic way. In addition, maize, common beans and maybe Cheno- podium sp. remains do account for the growing practices. According to this, a number of stone-walled canchones de cultivo (crop fields) and a simple irrigation system con- sisting of acequias (irrigation ditches) detected close to the site might have helped with the cultivation of these crops in the high pre-Puna environment. Furthermore, gathering activities are well represented in CI archaeological contexts by recovered chañar and algarrobo seeds and fruits. Both of these plants could have been obtained from the margins of Rio Cerro Colorado and Rio Totoral, in the Monte areas (see Fig. 4). Similarly, the nearest source of wild beans for the Cardonal people would have been the eastern slope of the sierra del Aconquija (Yungas), where it grows pro- fusely. Wild beans could have been gathered or, taking into account the model of ancient network and trading system, they could have been exchanged for some other Puna and valley products such as salt or meat. Indeed, the relationship with communities set in rainforest environments is also suggested by the presence of materials like hallucinogenic substances (Bugliani et al. 2010), and the similarities of some elements of ceramic style in the studied contexts (Scattolin et al. 2007). In terms of subsistence and economy, the taxonomie provenance of archaeobotanical evidence shows that people living at Cardonal complemented domestic plant cultivation with gathering wild plants, combining them with animal breeding and hunting activi- ties in a mixed system, as proposed for Formative com- munities in general in this area. However, charred plant remains also suggest that the Cardonal results show how these communities had access to an extensive resource base, integrated by ecologically dissimilar and complementary territories (valleys, Monte, Yungas), requiring diverse social, economic and practical strategies. The variability and complementarity of territories and practices seem to be expressed in the residential component of CI when both areas associated with food preparation, the SI and S5 hearth areas, are compared. Although they differ in density and quantities of plant remains, the most significant differences can be observed in the taxonomical composition of each set of plant remains. The sediments surrounding the hearth area in SI almost exclusively con- tained remains of maize and domesticated beans, as well as wild beans. In contrast, the seed remains found in the S5 hearth area represent the use of wild plant resources, such as algarrobo and chañar fruits, and possibly Chenopodium sp. seeds. The domesticated or wild character of all of these specimens could not be securely determined. No food plant recovered in SI was present in S5, or vice versa. Maize and common beans from the crop fields of Card- onal might have been available during the whole year, not only because they could be produced in good quantities, but also because they could be stored. Storage practices at CI have been indicated by large sized ordinary jars, pots, vessels and coiled baskets. These practices were not only devoted to food products but also to other materials, as indicated by one camelid bone tool and one obsidian pro- jectile point stored within S2 and S4. Then it is not difficult to think that corn and beans were the basic ingredients of daily meals prepared exclusively in SI. However, it should be noted that wild beans, brought in from a relatively distant territory, seem to have been included with food in a similar frequency to crops. This poses the question of whether the privileged geographical setting of Cardonal along the pre- Hispanic network of economic and social interaction pro- vided a considerable supply of exotic items such as wild beans. This possibility needs to be evaluated alongside the capacity provided by storage practices, which could have made wild beans available at levels comparable with the more commonly available maize and other seeds. These questions may also shed some light on the less structured hearth configuration of S5. As usual for wild resources, ripe fruits of algarrobo and chañar have a cyclical annual availability. Currently, flour, drinks and syrups made from them are produced by local people mainly in the season when fruits are ripe, although algarrobo pods can also be stored for some time (Capparelli 2007; Figueroa and Dantas 2006). They are also used in ceremonial and ritual activities, as we have observed in the valle del Cajón. These peculiari- ties suggest intermittent consumption and preparation activ- ities in the past, noticeable in the S5 archaeological hearth area. At the same time, the cyclical culinary practices related to chañar and algarrobo products could imply a more col- lective social character and consequently the "patio" at S5 provided a bigger and more open space than the "kitchen" at SI. Although they can be stored for a long time, Chenopo- dium sp. seeds associated with this group might be suggesting their seasonal availability and wild provenance. Conse- quently, they may have been involved in annually repeated activities, maybe with a ceremonial and community charac- ter, rather than with daily tasks of meal preparation. On the other hand, if Chenopodium sp. was a non-local domesticated or wild resource, obtaining it could have presented some difficulties. This apparently limited availability of Cheno- podium sp. at Cardonal could be explained by some form of geographical, ecological or cultural restrictions. In this sense, the study of domestic life and activities can help to pose new questions about variability and complexity of social interac- tions and subsistence practices in Formative Period com- munities of northwest Argentina. £) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Veget Hist Archaeobot (2014) 23:577-590 589 Acknowledgments This article is a part of a doctoral thesis, sup- ported by the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET-PIP 6553 and Doctoral fellowship), the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT-PICT 00-09575, PICT 04-20194 and Initial Research Fellowship), and the Universidad Nacional de La Plata (Project NI 1-436).
