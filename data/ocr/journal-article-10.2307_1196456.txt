New York: Macmillan, 1935. xv+354 pages. $2.50. This book will serve as a suggestive commentary on many of our present-day notions about the principles underlying law and government. The reviewer's interest in this subject was first awakened several years ago when he heard a locally distinguished member of the judiciary oracularly announce to a graduating class at his Alma Mater that law is discovered, not made. Clearly the implication was that laws merely ex- press in codes for society's guidance the rationality of the natural order, which for that particular spokesman meant also the divine order of the universe. Thus law had validity in its own right, once it had been properly discovered and enacted into legislation. To break the law was to sin against nature and reason; or, to state the thesis from a religious point of view, disobedience was a sin against God. Is this a valid philosophy of law, whether it is thought of as either natural or divine? Dr. Robson's treatise, while at the outset it sets up no theory to be proved, does issue in a very definite conclusion.

The story of men's thinking about law from the dawn of history to the present time is rapidly but acutely surveyed in the first two parts of the book, and on the basis of this survey Part III offers a constructive interpretation of "The Nature of Law." The history of thinking on the subject shows how closely men's religious beliefs, customs, and emotions have generally been bound up with, and have influenced the shaping of, their legal codes. Even when rationalism had dethroned the anthropomorphic deity, it proceeded without hesitation to deify nature as the ground of legal inerrancy, or-what amounted to the same thing--to demand unquestioning obedience to established codes sanctified by custom. Turning to the modern scientific age, our author asks what relation subsists between the laws of nature and the laws of man. His conclusion is that in the last analysis human thinking is responsible for giving the legal aspect to phenomena in both of these spheres. In human society laws are rules made by men for the guidance of conduct or the regulation of thinking. Thus they need to be grounded in intelligence and shaped in accordance with the most adequate knowledge available. "The old- fashioned idea of law as a menacing system of threats and punishments is," we are told, "as obsolete today as the Victorian theology which taught religion in terms of a fire-and-brimstone Hell." On the contrary, the es- sential purpose of law is to indicate a direction for valuable action or to make a declaration of consequences, and not to superimpose an infallible command. It is only a pragmatic creed. As such, it is of necessity always in process of becoming and is ultimately a product of human intelligence and human will. The result of this interpretation is both a new freedom and a new responsibility--a freedom from bondage to supernaturalism and tradition, and an obligation to establish a social order that will not dis- figure human lives and pervert human values. Education and intelligence must be made to prevail over narrow prejudices and rampant emotions. The author, who is Reader in Administrative Law at the University of London, is chiefly interested in the secular aspects of his subject, but his work is also very immediately valuable for religious thinking. The entire treatment makes thought-provoking and stimulating reading, whether one's concern is with secular or religious institutions. SHIRLEY JACKSON CASE University of Chicago</page></plain_text>
