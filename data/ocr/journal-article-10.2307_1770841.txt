<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARIANNE SHAPIRO From Atlas to Atlante T HE GENERAL aim of this paper is to probe the means by which Atlas became Atlante in Orlando furioso and to show that Ariosto's classical antecedents lie at the very heart of that poem's world. By examining some myths and metaphors of Atlas (Titan, astrologer, ocean, mountain, world) which are repeatedly evoked in the Furioso, my study focuses on the following interrelated issues: (1) the conflu- ence (or conflation) of different versions of the Atlas myth in the com- posite "Atlante"; (2) the idea of "function" as it pertains to Atlante among the other characters of the Furioso, most of whose functions are transferable; (3) Ariosto's cognizance of this relativity of function and possible concomitant interest in a contextually relevant aspect of Pe- trarch's poetry.' I explore some of the ways in which Ariosto imple- ments the spirit of Virgil and Ovid, and the use he makes not only of specific works but of already composite types bequeathed to the Renais- sance poet through medieval readings of the classics. I hope that my study may carry some of the import of iconographic studies in the visual arts.2 "Influences" are not only causes for "anxiety" but, for Ariosto, fair game for rewriting. But it is more appropriate to speak here of "in- fluences" than of "sources"; the best work on Ariosto's "sources" to date barely glances at the classical material, and not at all with respect to Atlante.3 Recent scholarship has entered into Ariosto's radical cri- 1 Commentators at least since Walter Binni have recognized the Petrarchan elements in the Furioso. See, for example, Nino Capellani, La sintassi narrativa dell'Ariosto: "nel Furioso c'e anche un altro petrarchismo: c'ei la trascrizione in ritmo narrativo del piui vero e grande mondo lirico del Petrarca" (Florence, 1952, p. 50). See also the references in Roberto Fedi's "Petrarchismo prebembesco in alcuni testi lirici dell'Ariosto," in L'Ariosto: lingua, stile e tradizione, ed. Cesare Segre (Milan, 1974), pp. 283-302. 2 I have in mind the tradition implementing source study as a means toward epistemological information, established by such books as Edgar Wind's Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance (New York, 1969) and Erwin Panofsky's Studies in Iconology (1939; rpt. New York, 1962). 3 The indispensable source study remains Pio Rajna, Le fonti dell'Orlando 323</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE tique of allegorisnm4 and documented the more readily recuperable of his tireless decontextualized citations, for instance from Dante.5 There is renewed interest in Ariosto's readings of Ovid" and in his demonstra- tions of his mastery over the imposing body of classical literature. But at this relatively early stage in the study of Ariosto's interplay with classical literary figures, it seems important to me to attempt the re- covery of both literal and less literal modes of thought suggested to Ariosto by his readings. To my knowledge, the figure of "Atlante" has not been studied before in this way. First among the things to be recovered is Atlante's real name, Atlas. This is not an attempt to rehabilitate some original Atlas. Any type once taken up by Ariosto is beyond rehabilitation, so inclusive is his ability to reorder and rescramble whatever he finds, and to raise baffling new obstacles that block meaning and deny any finality of interpretation. At the same time, it is evident that even this demurrer has to grasp at a provisional degree of meaning; at some arbitrary point of closure the destruction of meaning must stop short to preserve its communicability. This is how various senses of "Atlas" come to coexist in a composite type. Orlando furioso is the single text that sets the precedent of demystify- ing romance even as it adheres to its conventions-of demystifying, in fact, every other text that comes its way. That is probably why it was rescued from the bonfire of Don Quixote's discarded books as well as why many poets and playwrights accepted Ariosto's invitation to decide furioso (Florence, 1900), which focuses largely on Ariosto's more recent antece- dents. Among those aspects of the poem that have been discussed in detail, see Eduardo Saccone, "Cloridano e Medoro," in his II soggetto del Furioso (Naples, 1973), pp. 161-200. In this essay Saccone shows how the two pagans are assimi- lated to parallels in Virgil's Aeneid IX and Statius' Thebaid X. He also examines Pagna's view that the poem's title was suggested by Seneca's Hercules furens (pp. 214-22). 4 See, for example, David Quint, "Astolfo's Voyage to the Moon," YItS, 1 (1977), 398-408, and "The Figure of Atlante: Ariosto and Boiardo's Poem," MLN, 94 (1979), 77-91. In the latter, Quint argues that Atlante provides closure for the poem as epic. I would qualify in two ways the author's statement that "the impetus towards closure of the Furioso narrative reveals an authentic human temporality" (p. 84) : first, this closure is of a chiefly formal, as opposed to seman- tic, nature; second, it functions almost exclusively with respect to the Ruggiero- Bradamante pair, leaving untouched such open characters as Alcina and Angelica.

It suggests the tautological act of killing literature with literature. Ariosto's readings of Ovid, for example, do not produce a renovated, purified Ovid although they recognize the playful side of an oft-interpreted poet. Rather, they demonstrate that no text is safe from contamination through rereading. Let us assume that Atlante derives in large part from Ariosto's pon- dering on the Ovidian Atlas and on subsequent interpretations of that Atlas. If this is so, then Ariosto's departures from the composite tradi- tion become clear but they do not produce a general cleaning of the overlaid, varnished picture. Rather, the new Atlante becomes under- stood as a kind of "character-function," overlapping with confreres in the poem but independent of any direct relationship to other Atlases, including Ovid's. Still, the numerous Atlantean elements attested in other fabulae known to Ariosto clarify the literary consistency and con- tinued power of signification contained in the classical heritage. Knowingly or not, Ovid's medieval allegorizers used structural ho- mologies that were historically and culturally quite distant from one another, in order to define their coherences and to perceive shared pat- terns. Recognizing this relationship, Ariosto injects so much confusion into it as to display its conceptual limitations. From the allegorizers he retains not only a wealth of literal detail (for the precise purpose of parody) but the freedom to use Ovid and other classical writers in the same way that speakers use their mother tongues. So crowded with references and allusions is the world of the Furioso that piecing them out is like reconstructing an unknown language, and one may well doubt the utility of rebuilding a language that is turned solely to the purpose of destruction. The doubt is aggravated by the appearance of this effort in a literary climate that finds deconstructive criticism and pedantic source-hunting ideologically opposed to one another but concurrent in their lack of hospitality to structural ap- proaches. The problem may reside in determining the value of non- exegetical criticism, or criticism of nonallegorical literature (I use these terms in a quantitative, not a qualitative, sense). To the extent that critical approaches to such literature can illuminate both literary worlds and the worlds outside them, to the extent that reference and allusion become not only dialectical means for writers such as Ariosto but the key both to pleasure in the work and to insight into the society that produced it, the understanding of structure is nearly synonymous with literary analysis. 7 Ludovico Ariosto, Orlando furioso xxx.16.8, ed. Nicola Zingarelli (Milan, 1959); hereafter cited in the text as Of, followed by canto, strophe, and line numbers. 325</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Orlando furioso's structure reflects the generic needs of a nuptial poem (although it was not written for a wedding and is not an epitha- lamiurm). For Ariosto to accomplish the double feat of fulfilling the encomiastic purpose regarding Ruggiero and Bradamante and simul- taneously providing an epic exaggeration of their personalities and vicissitudes, it was necessary for them to possess markedly "divine" traits along with their human fallibilities. Ariosto effected a rapproche- ment of the human and divine poles. His poem cannot be thought of simply as a transformation of myth into literature that gives a concrete example of a decline in value. Even as Ariosto toys with the legends of gods, he exalts a man and woman whom he makes fabulous. Orlando himself retains the quasi-titanic capacity for obstinacy and physical con- flict that the Roland of the Chanson turns to his own discomfiture; from a structural standpoint it is really only when he is cured of his madness (not when he falls in love) that Orlando takes leave of Roland. In other words, although Ariosto, through many textual filters, transforms or alters a previous meaning, a semantic connection remains between that meaning when first encountered and the transformation it undergoes. Ariosto is not encomiastic about literature in his practice and no re- specter of its authority. At the same time he is generous in his praise of poets who shaped destinies, such as St. John the Evangelist (Of xxxv- .28.7-8). Under no condition could it be alleged that he restrains his powers of invention on account of some literary taboo. Ariosto's work thus acquires a tropological relationship to preceding works on similar subjects, a relation which may be compared to that of the terms in an overarching metaphor. But there can be no trope unless both the literal and the figural senses are present.8 By analogy with the trope, Ariosto's transformations would cease to exist as such without that moment when the "figure" that is the Furioso still had its two terms: the "literal"- the types and modes assimilated by Ariosto-and the "figural"-his reading of them. Thus do gods and men meet on new ground. When Atlas is trans- formed into a mystery-knight (Canto ii), a wizard of fairy legend (Cantos vi, xii, xxii), or an ailing old man (Canto iv), he may be under- stood as a trope-to be sure, one that runs downward, unlike Ruggiero and Bradamante, who move upward.9 Much of what happens to the titan Atlas in the Furioso corresponds to a movement long ago noted by Auerbach: in the world of cortesia, feudal elements lost the political 8 For the theory of tropes followed in this brief section, see Michael and Mari- anne Shapiro, Hierarchy and the Structure of Tropes (Bloomington, Ind., 1976). 9 Among contemporary critical works, C.

Brand's Ariosto: A Preface to the Orlando furioso (Edinburgh, 1973) contains the most thoughtful discussion of the encomiastic theme in the Furioso. 326</page><page sequence="5">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE function that had governed their usage in heroic epic.10 But for Atlas the change is not covered by different phases or aspects of medieval thought; its arc is far longer, encompassing early classical antecedents to the allegorism of medieval times, to the destruction of exegesis and its demotion to the status of a museum culture. For Ariosto, Atlante clearly controls a world unto himself. He al- ready exists in Orlando innamorato in the character of an old man, a profeta, incantator, and nigromante whose abode is on the Monte di Carena, or one of the Atlas Mountains." He has built a garden atop this mountain (Oi II.iii.27-28) which is walled in glass, and the wall is encircled with stone. Atlante's function as a pagan and a wizard con- sists, as later in Ariosto, of protecting Ruggiero and keeping him from conversion and war. Since he appears only in Book II it cannot be claimed that he bears the main weight of retarding Ruggiero's destiny, but he is already "Atlante, che giamai non lassa" (II.xxix.49.4). In Ariosto, Atlante remains the bearded necromancer who has reared Ruggiero and jealously guards him, first in a stable fortress and then by segregating others from him in the "palace of illusions." As an astrol- oger and the recipient of prophecy he has long ago learned from his stars that Ruggiero will die a Christian. Atlante's purpose is to keep Ruggiero as his ward, and to keep him a pagan. Neither the castle nor the richer, even more seductive palace of illusions provides centrality of location. Both can be destroyed by Atlante and instantly recon- structed.12 Atlante can put on any disguise; at different times he trans- forms himself into Angelica for Orlando and into Bradamante for Rug- giero. He lures into his realm of desire and illusion everyone whose efforts will (we learn) subsequently end up as residue on the moon. Into that world of credulity and hope and delight enter all those engaged in avid pursuit of some single object. But Atlante is subject to deter- rents (such as the horn whose sound chases everyone away) and ulti- mately to illness and death. His last appearance (Of xxxvi.59-66) is as a voice from his tomb, concurring in and abetting the disentanglement of relations between Ruggiero and his twin sister Marfisa, and thus 10 Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Litera- ture, trans.

Giuseppe An- ceschi (Milan, 1968) ; hereafter cited in the text as Oi, followed by book, canto, strophe, and line numbers. 12 Lanfranco Caretti notes in his essay "La poesia del Furioso" that the poem as a whole is uncentered: "Tutti i luoghi del Furioso ... tutti i luoghi dell'ine- sauribile geografia ariostesca divengono infatti, di volta in volta, temporanei centri della vicenda, punti vitali di confluenza o di intersezione di alcune delle sue diret- trici. Per tal modo l'Ariosto alla cosmogonia teocentrica medievale sostituiva definitivamente una cosmogonia antropomorfica nella quale il centro era, in ogni momento, liberamente variabile" (in his Ariosto e Tasso, Turin, 1961, p. 35). 327</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE putting the finishing touches on the union of the royal couple. This brief outline shows that Atlante is no mere "retarding device" for the action of the poem, though he does carry on the plot function that Boiardo in the Innamorato had allotted to the two "fairies," Grifone and Aquilante-that of keeping the heroes from their fated deaths in France.13 Atlante is a world, the Atlas of a moral geography that the poem embodies on every level. Like King Arthur's court when away from Camelot, Atlante's realm is the center of a domain whose circum- ference is nowhere, the focus of a centripetal movement rivaling that toward Christian and Saracen capitals alike, a prison often beloved and always comfortable for its (distinguished) inhabitants. Even when freed from it, some never want to leave. The patrimony of functions inherited from Boiardo is expanded and enriched in the Furioso so much as to divest itself of anything more than a simple contiguity- relationship to the Innamorato. Within the plot-structure of the Furioso itself, Atlante constitutes something of an exception: he is not doubled. The whole poem is marked by doubling and even multiplying characters and retelling stories (an obvious example is the two novelle embedded in different cantos, xxviii and xliii). Whereas Ruggiero and Orlando often double one another's plot-functions as they pass through similar adventures, and knights and ladies live so analogously that the labyrinth of the Furioso becomes frightening in its very sameness, there is only one Atlante, just as there is only one hippogryph. Atlante is the only magus and necromancer, the only old guardian, the only father-figure of any note (aside from the nonspeaking figureheads of Bradamante's father toward the end of the poem). Although the life of man is curtailed, and Atlante dies with his palace, we know that his work will go on in other quarters outside the poem: how else could the moon be so densely piled with residue? The destruction of the palace in Canto xxii hurls the prisoners back into the world of time and death, but it and they must have been preceded by likenesses, and are perhaps so at the moment of writing. These furnish the moon not only with what is lost by bad for- tune on earth (Of xxxiv.73.7) but also with desired fame and riches never won, promises and vows and engagements of devotion, treaties and pacts never kept, prayers to God and the saints, gifts and even adulatory poems to princes whose composition remained unrewarded- all the reified paraphernalia of desire and delusion, with more to come. And the vials of Sanity awaiting their future or forever lost owners prompt us to recall the perpetual "otherness" of the desired thing: Altri in amar lo perde, altri in onori, 13 Quint, in MLN, pp. 78-79. 328</page><page sequence="7">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE Altri in cercar, scorrendo il mar, ricchezze, Altri ne le speranze de Signori, Altri dietro alle magiche sciocchezze; Altri in gemme, altri in opre di pittori, Et altri in altro che piui d'altro aprezze; Di sofisti e d'astrologi raccolto E di poeti ancor ve n'era molto. (Of xxxiv.85) In theory it would be possible for Atlante to end on the moon with the other astrologhi, who give rise in this stanza to the recollection of poets. But this poem has only one poet and one astrologer. Although Ariosto puts rather severe limits on his supernatural powers (which do not extend to immortality or to keeping the plot going forever), Atlante while he lives is the custodian of a world of immortal deceptions. I might more accurately have said "two worlds": for although At- lante himself is not doubled, he first builds the castle on the Pyrenees in which Ruggiero spends an enclosed youth, then a limited converse of it, the palace of illusions (Of xii.21) into which knights and ladies gladly stream, the better for Atlante to keep them from Ruggiero. The first location is a sort of "castle in Spain" for Atlante (though Ariosto does not say so). The second is the more generalized and dominant place, its geographical location unspecified. And so, whereas the first castle may be the locus of A tlante's illusion (of being able to segregate Rug- giero permanently), the second is for everyone but Atlante and po- tentially all-inclusive, permitting the infinite proliferation of its deluded inhabitants. It is only after his death (Of xxxvi.59) that Atlante comes to repro- duce the plot-function of other prophets such as Merlin and Melissa, who throughout the poem have been oracles of a positive ending for the Ruggiero-Bradamante alliance. Only then does he speak freely of his past machinations and subterfuges regarding Ruggiero-when he is re- duced to a voice in a stone. Atlante's first and second appearances, described in detail in the same canto, show him on his hippogryph in flight. On the winged animal he can fly as high as an eagle (Of ii.49.8) and he tears through the air with his spear (ii.50.6), subsequently fighting Gradasso and Ruggiero simul- taneously from above. He is a volator (ii.52.11) and a cavalier celeste (ii.55.2) ; finally he brandishes the shield in Pinabello's face and stuns him, so that no one sees his enchanted flight. The castello Atlante builds for Ruggiero is impregnable (Of iii.67- .2, and ii.41.8). Ariosto emphasizes its extreme height (iii.67.2) and walls of steel (iv.12.2 and 6.3, and ii.43), as well as the mountain on which it stands: 329</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Vi sorge in mezo un sasso, che la cima D'un bel muro d'acciar tutta si fascia; E quella tanto inverso il ciel sublima, Che quanto ha intorno, inferior si lascia. Non faccia (chi non vola) andarvi stima; Che spesa indarno vi saria ogni ambascia. (iv.12.1-6) When Bradamante challenges him, Atlante materializes on the hippo- gryph, with his book of magic in hand. But Bradamante unhorses him, and he instantly metamorphoses into a pleading old astrologer. But he can still make himself and the castle disappear (iv.38-39), and he re- mains a "mago di somma dottrina" (vii.44.3). His second palace en- compasses the world of human desire and illusion: A tutti par, l'incantator mirando, Mirar quel che per se brama ciascuno, Donna, scudier, compagno, amico, quando II desiderio uman non e tutto uno. (xiii.50.1-4) Atlante's final strategem is to make Astolfo seem to every pursuer the one each is seeking to destroy, be he giant, peasant, or knight (xxii.19- 20). And since no one needs to be forced to stay in the palace, a host of warriors streams out of it to chase Astolfo. But as he lifts a great stone under which lies a "spirto" responsible for carrying out the spells of the palace, Astolfo destroys it with all its enchantments. By that time Ruggerio has spent ten cantos there, and Orlando is about to go mad. And yet Ariosto endows Atlante with magical powers only to have them confront other, decisive astrological influences whose prediction is at last fulfilled. Atlante can dominate only half of the Furioso (through Canto xxii) ; at the last he vanishes into the great stone out of which he later doubles and amplifies the Ruggiero-Bradamante prophecy. Atlante is a prime example of Ariosto's functional representation of classical allusion in romance guise. In the transfer of certain functions from the realm of divine to that of human energy, Atlas' character- function, drawn from classical mythology, is turned to the service of a genre and the heroic myth becomes a romance convention. Similarly the Age of Gold is remembered in the lightly mocking idyll of Angelica and Medoro. The conflict between divine power and human arrogance passes through many a genre to end in Rodomonte; and Atlas, all- seeing astronomer and supporter of the universe, becomes Atlante, the custodian of an illusory world and opponent of stellar prophecies. Although Ariosto does restore Ovid's sense of play, liberating him from the burden of moralizing precedent, he does not deprive himself 330</page><page sequence="9">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE of the pleasure of scanning the Ovidian myths through other texts and commentaries upon them. His rewriting through the welter of other texts, in fact, mirrors the labyrinthine paths of his characters, their crossings and recrossings, and the whole de-moralized map of their errare. The Furioso is not a work of restoration but of simultaneity and inclusion, a varia tela that "shows" more than it "tells," and for that reason is both hospitable to "iconographic" examination and inimical to the exegete. Ariosto went beyond the stage of the mere episode in his acceptance of suggestions from Ovid. The Metamorphoses, especially the fourth book, not only dominate the fabula of Ruggiero/Orlando and Angelica, as has been noted since the sixteenth century,'4 but penetrate far into the plot-structure of the entire poem.15 Therefore Ovid's Atlas pro- vides a logical point of departure for a reader who seeks to compare meanings and shades of meaning, to perceive unstated relations and implicit ideas, and to place them in at least a provisional context. Ovid conceives Atlas both as a man and as a mountain. The task of each is to support the world. The transformation of man into mountain occupies part of Book IV of the Metamorphoses and represents a con- siderable elaboration of Ovid's predecessors. Virgil had described Atlas as a giant who had assumed the likeness of a huge, snowy mountain commanding the western region of North Africa. Mercury, in flight to Aeneas, sights the mountain: iamque volans apicem et latera ardua cernit Atlantis duri, caelum qui vertice fulcit, Atlantis, cinctum adsidue cui nubibus atris piniferum caput et vento pulsatur et imbri ; nix umeros infusa tegit; tum flumina mento praecipitant senis, et glacie riget horrida barba. (And now in flight he descries the peak and steep sides of toiling Atlas, who props heaven on his peak-Atlas, whose pine-wreathed head is ever girt with black clouds, and beaten with wind and rain; fallen snow mantles his shoulders, while rivers plunge down the aged chin and his rough beard is stiff with ice.)16 Profiting from this amalgam of the toiling giant and the mountain, Ovid draws on the connection between Atlas and Perseus. He imagines that Perseus, returning across Libya with the head of Medusa, is swept here and there by violent and contrary winds which at last drive him 14 For example, by Simon Fornari, Spositione sopra l'Orlando furioso di M. Ludovico Ariosto (Florence, 1549-50), p. 233, as cited by Javitch, p. 85. 15 Frequent references to Ariosto's filiation with classical texts occur in Cesare Segre's edition of the Furioso (Milan, 1964). 16 Virgil, Aeneid IV.246-51, trans.

At this point Atlas is still a giant, in human form, ruling over this ex- treme edge of the West and over the sea, but alarmed by Themis' prophecy that one day his famous garden will be robbed by a son of Jove. Perseus, in requesting Atlas' hospitality, describes himself as a son of Jove, and Atlas, taking him for the robber, violently attempts to drive him away. Ovid tells of the massive walls Atlas had built to en- close his orchard and to keep all strangers from it. But his violence is of no avail against Perseus, who at last transforms him into the Moun- tain with the Medusa head: quantus erat, mons factus Atlas; nam barba comaeque in silvas abeunt, iuga sunt umerique manusque, quod caput ante fuit, summo est in monte cacumen, ossa lapis fiunt; tum partes altus in omnes credit in inmensum (sic di statuistis) et omne cum tot sideribus caelum requievit in illo. (Straightway Atlas became a mountain huge as the giant had been; his beard and hair were changed to trees, his shoulders and arms to spreading ridges; what had been his head was now the mountain's top, and his bones were changed to stones. Then he grew to monstrous size in all his parts-for so, 0 gods, ye had willed it- and the whole heaven with all its stars rested upon his head.)17 In a subsequent reference Perseus refers to Atlas only as a mountain, as if this had been so before he procured the Gorgon's head: narrat Agenorides gelido sub Atlante iacentem esse locum solidae tutum munimine molis. (Met. IV.772-73) ([The descendant of Agenor] told how beneath cold Atlas there was a place safe under the protection of the rocky mass.) The last reference to Atlas in the Metamorphoses, in Book XV, is of peculiar relevance to the study of Ariosto. The speaker is Pythagoras ("Samius" or "man of Samos"), and what he has to say precedes the exposition of Pythagoras' doctrine of transmogrification. He will sing, he announces, of hidden, great things from the vantage point of moun- tain heights: iuvat ire per alta astra, iuvat terris et inerti sede relicta nube vehi validique umeris insistere Atlantis palantesque homines passim et rationis egentes despectare procul trepidosque obitumque timentes sic exhortari seriemque evolvere fati!

The passage strongly evokes not only the rides on the hippogryph that at different times provide Atlante, Ruggiero, and Astolfo with an aerial perspective on the world, but the very stance taken by Ariosto as the poet of the Furioso. I need not emphasize, of course, that the philoso- pher unfolding the secrets of fate is replaced by the poet with his in- finite mobility and capriciousness. The only possible ascent above the world of unreason and folly is on the hippogryph (which first appears as an attribute of Atlante). Superimposed images of Atlas the giant and Atlas the mountain do occur in the Furioso: one instance is embedded in the same fourth canto that first presents the castle on the Pyrenees and the winged knight. But like the titanic size evoked by references to the mountain in both Virgil and Ovid, these images set topographic limits or convey the notion of hyperbolic space. The King of Scotland promises to Gi- nevra's champion "il fior di quante belle donne / Da l'Indo sono all'At- lantee colonne" (Of iv.61.7-8). Astolfo's tour on the hippogryph in- cludes every "province" that lies "tra la marina e la silvosa schiena / Del fiero Atlante" (Of xxxiii.100.5-6). The "unsayability" topos de- scribes Agramante's army as innumerable; the only possible description would be by one who "Dira quante onde, quando e il mar piu grosso, / Bagnano il piede al Mauritano Atlante" (Of xiv.99.3-4). The vast ex- tent of the desert from "I'Atlante ai liti Rubri" (the Dead Sea, viii.67) is mentioned as the habitat of serpents, and Astolfo travels "dal mar d'Atlante ai termini d'Egitto" (xxxiii.98.4). All of these allusions con- cur with Ovid's depiction of Atlas as the paragon of height and breadth, and as the expression of immense boundaries. Among far earlier poets than Ovid, Atlas stands at the border be- tween heaven and earth, and between night and day. Hesiod's Theog- ony (line 507) had already named him as one of the Titans (hence a brother of Prometheus). The Titans collectively and individually per- sonified the agonistic aspect of human nature, and it is likely that Atlas as the epitome of struggle and endurance subsists from Hesiod's char- acterization. Oppressed by powerful force on the very limits of the world, he upholds the heavens with tireless arms and head (lines 517- 20). Hesiod locates the home of Atlas in the westernmost part of the world, just before the Hesperides ("western maidens") and the House of Night (lines 746-49). "Prudent Zeus" (line 520) placed him there, 333</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE it is understood, as a direct result of the misuse of his strength in the rebellion of the Titans. In Hesiod, Atlas clearly marks a boundary between east and west, day and night. Homer saw Atlas as the overseer and caretaker of the columns rooted in the earth which support the heavens (Odyssey 1.52; III.486).18 Homer also seems to recognize in Atlas the buoyant power of the ocean, for he names Atlas the father of Calypso, whose home is the western Atlantic, and says that Atlas knows all the depths of the sea (Od. IV.385). For some readers of Homer the pillars upheld by Atlas were embedded in the bottom of the ocean, arising out of it to support the clouds. Whereas Homer gave no indication of the connection be- tween Atlas and a mountain, Herodotus (IV.84) mentions an ex- tremely high mountain in northwestern Africa called "Atlas" and "Pil- lar of Heaven." Like the columns of a great hall and circling the earth on all sides, the chain of mountains seemed to support the clouds and to maintain the tension and separation obtaining between heaven and earth. The rich and powerful king who in Homer knows the mysteries of Ocean was developed by others into a seer, and even a mathematician and philosopher as well as an astronomer. Virgil says that the singer lopas, with his golden lyre, had been taught by Atlas; and he has lopas sing of the voyages of Sun and Moon (Aen. 1.740). Although Ovid himself does not develop this aspect of Atlas, it survives in his allego- rizers. Servius' commentary on the Aeneid contributes to the tradition of Atlas as polymath and singer.'" Before turning to this important legacy of the astronomer Atlas, I shall briefly follow a final line of inquiry relating to the classical con- 18 Some commentators glossed Homer's lines to mean that the columns sup- ported the earth also. An inventory of these is provided in the invaluable reference work by Wilhelm H. Roscher, Ausfiihrliches Lexikon der griechischen und r6- mischen Mythologie (Leipzig, 1884-1919), p. 706. 1i Servius writes that Atlas was Hercules' teacher in philosophy and, in one version, that of Mercury also: "Hic Atlas, lapeti filius, in Africa natus dicitur. hic, quod annum in tempora diviserit et primus stellarum cursus vel circulorum vel siderum transitus naturasque descripserit, caelum dictus est sustinere, qui nepotem suum Mercurium et Herculem docuisse dicitur, unde et Hercules caelum ab Atlante susceptum sustinuisse narratur, propter caeli scientiam traditam." ("It is said that Atlas, son of Iapetus, was born in Africa. He, who divided the year temporally and first described the course of the planets and the circuits of the stars and the nature of their travel, is said to uphold the heavens. He is said to have instructed his descendant Mercury and Hercules, wherefore it is told that Hercules assumed the support of the heavens from him-on account of the knowl- edge of the skies which was conveyed.")

It deals with the fabled isle of Atlantis, which Plato discusses in the Timaeus and at considerable length in the Critias. Plato tells of an unusually fertile and rich land beyond the Pillars of Hercules, separated by a chain of islands from a further continent. Atlas' people dug canals and cultivated the land, but the Timaeus emphasizes their warlike nature and the vastness of the empire they accumulated, which included Libya, within the Pillars of Hercules, as far as Egypt, and Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This people eventually became audacious enough to attack the Athenians, an enterprise which quickly resulted in an Athenian triumph. Next, a series of natural disasters caused At- lantis to disappear into the depths of the sea. As a result, Plato con- cludes in the Timaeus, the Atlantic Ocean ceased to be navigable, for the sinking of the island raised shoals of mud that could not be passed. It was only then that the Pillars formed a limit to exploration in a practical sense. In the Critias Plato elaborates a description of Atlantis.20 Certain aspects of his account coincide with the later story of King Atlas, so jealous of his orchards. The very existence of Atlantis, Plato explains, arises from the enclosure of its land by Poseidon, who loved Atlas' mother, Cleito,21 so jealously that he surrounded the hill on which she lived with alternate zones of sea and land (sec. 114). Plato then details the greatness of the ensuing empire, of its natural resources, trade, mili- tary strength, and the height of its civilization. The city lay in a plain surrounded by mountains which descended abruptly into the sea, moun- tains "celebrated for their number and size and beauty, far beyond any which still exist" (sec. 118). The Atlanteans began as a virtuous people obedient to the divine side of their dual nature (secs. 119-21), caring little for the wealth that accrued to them and given to simplicity and friendship, "but when the divine portion began to fade away, and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture, and the human nature got the upper hand, they ... grew visibly debased" (sec. 121). The Critias ends with a council of the gods called by Zeus (which appears to preface the de- struction of Atlantis) and breaks off as he begins his sentence. Up to this point Plato's description has expanded on the extreme richness of the kingdom-the palaces, baths, racecourses, and temples-and the cultivation of the vast central plain fed by water from the hills which ringed it completely. If the Atlanteans had not extended their empire 20 Critias, secs. 110-21. For Plato I have used the edition and translation by Benjamin Jowett, 10th ed. (New York, 1920), pp. 3-84; hereafter cited in the text by sections only. 21 In a number of other accounts the mother of Atlas was Clymene or Ge; see Roscher, p. 707. These versions offer no explanation of the rise and fall of Atlantis. 335</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE beyond the Pillars of Hercules, Atlantis proper would have consisted of this territory, entirely surrounded by land, except for the seaward gap with its harbor works. It is noteworthy that Atlas is associated with a people who, besides being simply "eastern," are inimical to the Athenians. The idea of a realm belonging to Atlas appears in the Meta- morphoses, where it is also described as unusually prosperous and fer- tile. But in the myth of Atlantis the kingdom expands into a small world, and its location near North Africa argues for the possibility that Atlantis contributes to the aggregate of suggestions to Ariosto about a fabled, though not always virtuous, enclosed "universe" of pleasure and eventual delusion, and one that is "Moorish" in conception. Neither Plato's Atlas nor Ovid's has much to do with the Titan, as- tronomer, and habitue of the ocean who eventually gives rise to the mago Atlante. This side of Atlante was bequeathed to Ariosto in all probability by the allegorizations of Ovid which are present through- out the intricately woven fabric of the Orlando furioso. Allegorizations of Ovid such as that by Petrarch's good friend Petrus Berchorius (Pierre Bersuire), among the last in a long medieval tradition of myth- ological exegesis, were often reprinted in Ariosto's time.22 Their pur- pose was to show how myths could be interpreted for moral purposes and the exposition of Christian doctrine and historical truth. Berchorius' text is representative of allegorized readings of Ovid and was followed by others well into the sixteenth century. Among the myths that best display the success of his method he adduces that of Atlas and Perseus. Quod etiam in fabulis aliquando lateat veritas historica patet in fabula Atlantis. Perseus enim dicitur Gorgoniam occidisse et cum (capite) eius Atlantem maxi- mum gigantem in montem qui Atlas dicitur convertisse quia s. Perseus miles strenuus orti regis, qui in insulis meridionalibus que Gorgone dicuntur regnabat, occidit et vicit Gorgonii filiam, et caput eius i. divicias, regnum et substanciam tulit, cum quo exercitum congregavit, ita quod Atlantem regem Affrice superavit ipsumque in montem fugere coegit. Et quia postea non comparuit, in montem muta- tum poetica garrulitas ipsum dicit. (Ghisalberti, p. 88) (That historical truth is sometimes hidden in fables is shown by the fable of Atlas. It is said that Perseus killed the Gorgon and transformed the great giant Atlas with it into the mountain called Atlas, because the sturdy soldier Perseus killed "Gorgon," the king of the orchard, who reigned over the southern isles; and con- quered and killed the Gorgon's daughter; and by taking her head is meant that he took the kingdom and wealth with which he called together an army that triumphed over Atlas the African king and forced him to flee to a mountain. And since Atlas -2 The fundamental work on the Ovidius Moralizatus is Fausto Ghisalberti, "L'Ovidius Moralizatus di Pierre Bersuire," Studi romanzi, 13 (1933), 5-132.

Vel dic quod Athlas signat altos et subtiles theologos et philosophos qui s. celum videntur attingere in quan- tum de celestibus consueverunt sciencialiter disputare ... Vel di quod iste Athlas est Dei filius. (Ghisalberti, p. 119) (Atlas was the great king of outermost Spain ... Or say that Atlas denotes high and subtle theologians and philosophers who are seen to attain to heaven in that they were accustomed to dispute celestial things scientifically ... Or say that Atlas is God's own son.) Berchorius draws substantially from Fulgentius in his narrative of the myth.24 Other interpreters, including the poet of the Ovide moralise, combine Atlas the king with the philosopher and astronomer: - Athlas fu rois de grant noblesce Et sorabondans en richesce. Mestres fu de philozophie. Tant sot de l'art d'astronomie, Qu'il sot de tout le firmament L'ordenance et le mouvement Et des estoiles la nature Et la chalour et la froidure Et la cause dont ce venoit: Por ce dist 1'en qu'il soustenoit Le firmament desor sa teste.25 Note the displacement of Atlas from upholder of the heavens to con- server of knowledge about them. The Ovide moralise poet goes on to explain the allegorical meaning of the orchard: it is the cuer of Atlas, wherein is cultivated the art of philozophie, signified also by the golden tree. Perseus and Hercules (whose myths are conflated) are thus recog- nized as having important features in common, for Atlas feared Perseus as the robber of his golden fruit (although the thief was to be Hercules). Both Perseus and Hercules, the author says, are above all devoted learners and imitators of Atlas, and the serpent Atlas set to guard the apples seems to represent the difficulties of study. But both triumph over it and take the fruit: 23 Note the appearance of Medusa as a king's daughter, which reverts to ver- sions older than Ovid's in which Medusa is a rich and powerful queen.

(Om, lines 6322-35) Boccaccio, in the .Genealogia deorum gentilium, follows Fulgentius as far as does Berchorius, but adds to Fulgentius' analysis of Atlas Augustine's acknowledgment of the Titan's astrological powers (De civitate Dei, XVIII.viii). He also points out that Pliny attributes the invention of astrology to Atlas, "et hinc, ob sudores ex arte susceptos, celum humeris tolerasse dictum est."26 ("And so because of the sweat drawn by the practice of his art, he is said to carry the world on his shoulders.") Boccaccio's account, then, conjoins the aspects of kingship, arcane wisdom, and forbearance that compose the figure of Atlas in varying degrees throughout the Ovidian allegorizations. It is not far to the gloss of Atlas as a Christ-figure in Berchorius and as God the Father in the Ovide moralisd. I cite from the Ovide moralise the lines which agree with the characterization of Atlas as a wise man: Cil cria ciel et mer et terre, Si fist le soleil et la lune Et les estoiles. De chascune Sot le nombre et quel force elle a, Et per lor nons les apela. Cil porte tout le firmament, Et done a tous soustenement Par la vertu de sa parole.

(lines 6423-33) The master of clergie who composed these lines returns naturally to the old metaphor of the book of the universe. And here the strength of the Word upholds the world, reinforcing the idea of Atlas as the repository of knowledge. 26 Giovanni Boccaccio, De genealogie deorum gentilium, ed. V. Romano (Bari, 1951), IV.xxxi. 338</page><page sequence="17">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE Whether as Creator, sage, or powerful king of a fabled domain, Atlas remains the sumnnnation of a world throughout these medieval character- izations. He is a composite type whose single outstanding trait is that he can include everything. This all-inclusiveness is retained as a feature when the ocean and mountain named for him are mentioned in classical and post-medieval writings. But it is a domain tinged in medieval accounts with a certain negative (or at best, ambiguous) value. As guardian of the golden tree Atlas placed a wall around the garden (Met. IV); as a mountain range he shut it in. If in several allegorical readings that tree symbolizes philozo- phie, then the surrounding walls variously represent study, with its attendant obstacles, or in another late reading (that of the Spanish scholar Enrique de Villena, cited by Aldo Bernardo) "the order and principles within which wisdom is enclosed."27 But the fruit is also reminiscent of the other, forbidden tree of knowledge. And the location of Atlas at either end of the Atlas Mountains, and/or near the fabled Lake Tritonis in Libya, should make it unnecessary for Ariosto to have to emphasize the "paganness" of Atlante; he is "Mauretanian" or "Af- rican" partly because that is the location of his mountain. In the com- posite of allegorizations, whether a king, sage, or magus, Atlas repre- sents a world that only borders the known world. Beyond the limits of the Pillars of Hercules (or Atlas Mountains) he enjoys a ubiquity based on the unknown, ultima tellus. Embodying a power that straddles accustomed boundaries and medi- ates between heaven and earth (as between night and day), Atlas is a brilliant choice for Atlante's forebear. No longer a symbol of physical force or tension, Ariosto's elegant magus travels easily between earth and sky on the wings of the hippogryph. Of course he is able to read prophecies in the stars, due to his reputation as an astronomer-astrolo- ger; and like his namesake in Ovid, he opposes the prophecy of what will be taken from him. Ovid's Atlas mistook Perseus, while Atlante makes no mistake about the source of his eventual deprivation. But each stands uselessly against the gods or the people of the gods. Al- though Atlante has absorbed the arcane knowledge Atlas possessed, it seems equally available to anyone who captures his magic book (as Ruggiero does, and later Astolfo). Atlante's knowledge of stellar and marine mysteries; his jealousy of Ruggiero, which corresponds to Atlas' concerning the golden apples; his mediating power between heaven and earth as expressed in his flight on the hippogryph (which enables Atlante to fight from a lofty 27 Aldo Bernardo, Petrarch, Scipio and the Africa (Baltimore, Md., 1962), pp. 147-48. My discussion of the Africa leans on this invaluable work. 339</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE position in the guise of an armed knight) ; and his beautiful, wealthy, and "African" domain of illusions, so like the fabled realm of Atlas, clearly recall the anterior composite type. But two of these features are transferable-the knowledge, portable in his book, and the hippogryph. They atrophy to little more than functions that temporarily define Atlas by opposition to other characters, who are "personnages-signes,''"8 act- ing in relay as vectors of a single message. Ariosto's reassignment of these functions-riding the hippogryph, reading the magic book, cross- ing and recrossing the same labyrinthine paths-underscores the illu- sory aspect of all of his geographical and concrete paraphernalia, all the props that, rather than being moved about, come to move the char- acters. If I am correct in supposing that the characters are "plot-func- tions," largely present in order to be pushed and pulled about by the mischief inherent in their reified natures, it is also true that they are assigned natures and objects of desire just as some get horses (often runaway ones)29 while others get veils and skirts. Atlante's desire to remain a world unto himself also ends up exposed as a delusion, for his world not only can be moved but can also be collapsed-and not just by Atlante but by any reader of his magic book. How better can one show the malleability of all poetic matter? The giant turned forever to stone and the magician sent to live under his tombstone as a voice are in this respect one; the medievalized "fairy"-model faithfully echoes his petrified antecedent. It is appropriate, therefore, for Atlante the Moor to meet the punishment suffered still by Atlas the giant. The ubiquitousness of the character-sign in the Furioso is one of Ariosto's means of setting texts free from anterior contexts and chal- lenging the possibility of any kind of final textual authority."a His own, he says, is partially an open book, too. Ariosto's catholic treatment of the composite types assembled from classical myths and their medieval and Renaissance allegorizers provides yet another means. I have shown that Ariosto does not strip the layers of "later" exegesis but uses them; 28 The term is borowed from Ferdinand de Saussure in D'Arco Silvio Avalle's essay, "La Semiologie de la narrativite chez Saussure," Essais de la theorie du texte (Paris, 1973), pp. 19-49. The article consists chiefly of Saussure manuscript notes with some analysis. See Saussure's discussion of characters: "Chacun des personnages est un symbole dont on peut varier ... a. le nom, b. la position ..., c. le caractere, d. la fonction, les actes" (p. 29). Saussure is referring to char- acters from the Nibelungenlied, Avalle to characters from Dante's Commedia. The adaptation to Ariosto is my own. -21 For a penetrating analysis of the symbolism of horses and their connections with aspects of human nature in the Furioso, see A.

He shows that the state of blinding desire and pursuit is common to human beings at any time. Ariosto's implementation of suggestions from classi- cal literature is itself eclectic, and it might not be excessive to suggest that he perceived-as would anyone working with the contradictory, episodic, syncopated, partial renderings of classical myth-that these too present a tangled, mysterious picture. Given the difficulties of sepa- rating out any strand of this skein one might ask whether it is possible to detach the "classical" from the "medieval" aspects of his retelling. This can be done only through careful philological study and point-by- point comparison of all the "authorized versions" of his stories. Such work may be the only way out of the realm of illusion Ariosto created for his readers. Like that realm, Atlante's lies on the boundary of the known world, not beyond it. The very invention of a palace of illusions may have taken wing from a precedent in Petrarch's poetry. How does the kingdom of Atlas become transformed into a palace of illusions ? I suggest that a kinship exists between Ariosto's brilliant innovation and the presence of a possible realm of Truth in Petrarch's Africa. Although this epic poem was largely neglected in its own time, it was published and republished in Venice early in the sixteenth century (in 1501 and 1503). It is not far-fetched to suppose that Ariosto might have known Africa. A (now missing) Mantuan codex has been indicated by its most thorough editor, Nicola Festa, in addition to the Codex Ur- binate in the Vatican Library. Africa recounts the victories of Scipio (Africanus), following closely the account in Livy. Petrarch's return to Roman history for the substance and inspiration of his epic, his Her- culean efforts to revive classical Latin language and style, and his per- ception of the spirit of Romanitas distinguish this work from major efforts of other medieval poets and prompt Morris Bishop's apt obser- vation that "Africa should rightfully be seen as the earliest Renaissance epic rather than as a medieval artifact.""' In his important book Petrarch, Scipio and the Africa, Aldo Ber- nardo analyzes the meanings of Scipio Africanus in Petrarch's poetry.32 His analysis emphasizes the portrayal of Scipio as the embodiment of "the humanistic ideal of the supreme man of action" and Petrarch's concomitant self-designation as the poet "who will sing so worthily of Scipio that, like Scipio, he will merit the laurel crown" (B, p. 47). Thus by celebrating the victor over Hannibal and the savior of Rome, Pe- trarch fuses the images of poetry and glory, "and this fusion, encom- 31 Petrarch and His World (Blomington, Ind., 1963), p. 177. 32 See note 27; hereafter cited in the text as B.

In addition to this work of renovation Pe- trarch's Scipio was to exemplify a reconciliation of classical and Chris- tian ethical ideals. Scipio could easily be upheld as an exemplar of both warlike and civilized traits, as he had been by a succession of authorities from Cicero to Macrobius and on into the Middle Ages. In any event it is within that tradition that the maga Melissa designates Scipio to Ruggiero as one of the models he should emulate together with Alex- ander and Caesar (Of vii.59.3). Long before the creation of Ruggiero in Boiardo's Innamorato Scipio had been viewed as a figura (according to Auerbach's definition) 33 and as an instrument of historical fulfillment in time. The Africa goes so far in the depiction of fulfilled prophecy, and its chief character so clearly exemplifies the intrinsic superiority of the conquering Romans, that the poem provides an apt comparison for subsequent Italian epics. In Africa the titanic aspect of Atlas the man-mountain emerges at several points. Two of these are connected with exhortatory purposes. When Scipio's father meditates on his imminent death and the African iniquities and urges Scipio to a life of combat, he hopes that the Africans will be punished in an adynaton or "impossibility-figure" :4 Num periure denissimus Atlas Telluris clipeus, mundi tutela nefandi, Cedet sponte loco radice revulsus ab imo, Serpentumque acies montesque immittet harene Ardentis, facietque viam spirantibus Austris ?as Affronted by such sins shall not great Atlas, shield and guardian of an abominable world, uproot itself from out of the depths of earth and so make way for swarming vipers, hills of burning sand, and yield free passage to the scorching blasts borne from the south ?36 33 Erich Auerbach, "Figura," in his Scenes from the Drama of European Liter- ature: Six Essays (New York, 1959), pp. 11-76. 34 For a discussion of the adynaton as a figure frequently appearing in Pe- trarch's poetry to connote or denote a realm of possibility beyond nature, see Marianne Shapiro, Hieroglyph of Time: The Petrarchan Sestina (Minneapolis, Minn., 1980), pp. 70-90. 35 Africa 111.58-62.

Wilson, Petrarch's Africa (New Haven, Conn., 1977). 342</page><page sequence="21">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE Again, the image of Atlas juxtaposes the two views in a sweeping period: Huc olim Argolici finxere poete Convenisse deos, potuque ciboque refectos Ethiopum cum rege gravis duxisse sub umbra Athlantis placidam tranquillo numine noctem: Quod fictum est ideo quia numina magna putabant Sidera, que liquidis primum vescuntur in undis, Ethiopum quas litus habet, mox fessa videntur Vergere ad occasus, ubi maximums eminet Athlas, Ultima terrarum qui possidet: ille paratus Excipit ac magno venentia contegit antro. ( 1I.377-86) There once the gods convened (so feign the Argolian bards) and took their rest refreshed with meat and drink, and passed a night of tranquil ease beneath the shade of Atlas in converse with an Ethiopian king. So might they fable because they believed the stars were great divinities who first rose from their dwelling in the waves that beat on Ethiopia's shores and then, grown weary, seemed to turn westward where great Atlas strains bearing aloft the last of lands. He waits to take them as they come and shelter them in his vast cave. (lines 487-99) This is again Ovid's ultima tellus, and Petrarch follows the boundary of that outer world from a beginning in "Ethiopia" in East Africa to the extreme west. Atlas the astronomer comprehends both the setting and rising of the stars through the allegorization of geography. In Pe- trarch's characteristically anthropomorphic reading of nature, the stars themselves become weary of their journey, and here he links this kind of reading to the prisci poetae 'first poets.' Even closer to the Petrarch of the Canooniere is his version of Atlas' transformation into a moun- tain. With reference to Scipio a minstrel sings to him and his men of one who has dared to pass the Pillars of Hercules: sed nuper ab Ortu Vesanus veniens iuvenis convollere metam Est ausus, nomenque ideo mutare nequivit Herculis auctoris, Libie cui rara tenenti Longevus nimioque Atlas sub pondere fessus Deposuit celum ac stellas ; sic ipse quievit.

(Africa 111.400-12) But newly, from the east, a savage youth has dared to spurn such limits, yet has failed to change the name they bear since Hercules defined the frontier, he to whom old Atlas, lord of all Libya's kingdoms, wearying of his great burden, gave in trust the stars and lofty heavens while he took his ease. Nor did the wretch repose for long; bewitched, he burned to look upon Medusa's face and so was turned to stone. Behold him now: darkening the world with his vast shade he stands, far reaching into space and with his head touching the highest stars. Eternal snow enshrouds him and he towers for all time, harassed by thunder, wind and cloud and storm. (lines 501-15) The final lines of this evocation are derived from Virgil's description. Ovid alludes briefly to the episode in which Hercules assumed the sup- port of the heavens from Atlas ("hac caelum cervice tuli"; "Upon this neck I upheld the sky"; 1Met. IX.198). But the narrative emphasis falls upon the transformation of Atlas by Medusa, which Bernardo desig- nates as the Medusan transformation most frequently mentioned in Pe- trarch's poetry as a whole (p. 138). In the sequence of Ovid's account it is clear that by the time Perseus displays the Medusa-head to Atlas it is already wreathed with serpents. But in the end of the fourth book Perseus explains why Medusa, alone among her Gorgon sisters, has snaky hair; once beautiful, she was loved and ravished by Neptune, and to punish this deed Athena changed Medusa's hair into serpents (Met. IV.794-801)."I The double aspect of Medusa, beautiful and terrible, was recognized in medieval allegori- zations." Petrarch's allusions to Medusa in the Can.oniere are bound up with the idea of restlessness. His desire, in addition to being "folle," "fero," and "vago," is "fermo," and since this aspect of it could find its .7 In other versions of the myth Medusa is punished for having challenged the beauty of Athena's hair. See Fontenrose, pp. 284-85. 38 The Ovide moralise contains allusions to Medusa's former beauty (IV.5666), following Fulgentius, who also mentions her great wealth, increased by cultivation and husbandry (Whitbread, p. 61). In his important article on Dante's Furies, "Dante's Medusa: The Letter and the Spirit," YItS, 4 (1972), 1-18, John Freccero discusses the symbolism of Medusa as it was transmitted to Dante, with reference also to Boccaccio, De genealogie X.9. 344</page><page sequence="23">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE appropriate symbol in the face of Medusa (CLXXIX.10), she becomes the image whose appearance in "Vergine bella" (CCCLXVI) is the extreme expression of Petrarch's revulsion at his own desire. Petrarch begins one poem by comparing Laura to Daphne and her dazzling power. This leads into his regret that he cannot transform himself into his beloved or into stone: for Laura's eyes have narrowly missed doing so: E s' io non posso transformarmi in lei piii ch'i' mi sia (non ch'a merce mi vaglia), di qual petra piui rigida s'intaglia, pensoso ne la vista oggi sarei, o di diamante, o d'un bel marmo bianco per la paura forse.39 Following through the Medusan subtext, Petrarch seems to concur with the gloss (derived from Fulgentius40) that the Ovide moralise provides for Medusa, which is fear: Gorgon l'orible signifie Paor, qui fet home enfredir De sa pensee et enredir, Et met en orrible freor. (Om, lines 5777-80) The link with Atlas penetrates deep into the fabric of the poems. Laura has the same power over him as "nel vecchio mauro / Medusa, quando in selce transformollo" (CXCVII.6-7). That fear and fixity are deeply fused together in the mountain itself is substantiated by Bernardo's observation that even the previously cited description of Atlas in the Aeneid (the most direct antecedent of Petrarch's in Africa) is itself an extension of that image, a "projection of Aeneas' fixation on Dido" (p. 49). And Petrarch's evocation of serpents and the burning sands of Libya actually describes the Libyan terrain wet with Medusa's blood. As Perseus flew over the sands bearing the head, those drops on the earth changed into serpents (Met. IV.617-20). Orlando furioso contains no overtly presented Medusa-figure. Yet Orlando's obsession with Angelica constitutes an outstanding example of a Medusan love-fixation, freezing the lover out of his function as a warrior and expressed in terms of Petrarchesque devotion. While it is difficult to denote precisely those stylistic peculiarities in Orlando's 39 Canzioniere, LI.5-10. I quote from the edition by Giovanni Ponte (Milan, 1968), hereafter cited in the text. 40 "The first terror is indeed that which weakens the mind; the second, that which fills the mind with terror; the third, that which not only enforces its pur- pose upon the mind but also its gloom upon the face" (Whitbread, p. 62). Each of these is represented by a Gorgon sister, the third by Medusa. 345</page><page sequence="24">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE love-laments that derive from Petrarch directly (without the overlay of his less distinguished successors), the presence of another subtext insinuates itself more directly. It is composed of a nexus of Virgilian- Ovidian-Petrarchan plot elements and concepts, and is hospitable to their glosses. The Ovide mioralist, for example, goes on characterizing Medusa as fear so as to explain that it is divided into three kinds; one weakens the heart, the second makes it sink, and the third hardens it: "Si qu'il ne peut apercevoir / Qui soit menqonge ne qui voir" (lines 5784-85). Enfredir, enredir, and endurcir: these three verbs character- ize the effect of the third kind of fear. They result in a loss of judgment, that is, in the lack of just that feature needed in Orlando furioso for the negotiation of the labyrinthine world. Yet when the lover in Petrarch expresses the wish that he too had been petrified, he sees that trans- formation as freedom from the state of eternal desire: e sarei fuor del grave giogo et aspro. per cu' i' ho invidia di quel vecchio stanco che fa co le sue spalle ombra a Marrocco. (LI.12-14) The resonance of this weary Atlas in that other of the Africa, "sub pondere . . . fessus," and in the very stars as described in that work, conveys the notion of a tired world dutifully supporting the heavens. May we not also perceive some wordplay in that giogo (yoke), a word also applied to a chain of mountains ? At any rate, Petrarch deploys in these lines a yoke comparable to that of the giant, once again a salient example of Atlas doubled as mountain and man. It seems as if the plurality of references to Atlas in the Cansoniere could account alone for any direct Petrarchan influence up)on Atlante in the Furioso. As we continue to examine the readings of Atlas available to Ariosto from Iletrarch, however, the explanatory force of Africa potentially exceeds anything available in the Italian poems. I refer to the detailed depiction of a palace and its surrounding domain, accepted by a number of scholars as the palace of Syphax, a Libyan king to whom Scipio sends Laelius for the purpose of an alliance.41 The passages occur in the third book of Africa following a brief textual lacuna, and chiefly concern the wealth and ornamentation of the palace and the sculptures disposed throughout it that figure the gods. The creator of the palace was Atlas, 41 For a synopsis of earlier views on the identity of this palace, see Nicola Festa, "Il palazzo della Veritai e le lacune dell'Africa," Giornale dantesco, 27 (1924), 197-201. E. H. Wilkins, who did not fully accept the idea of a misplaced passage suggested by Festa, observes nevertheless that "it is probable that [the passage in question] occurred originally in a description . . . of a Palace of Truth built by Atlas" ("Descriptions of Pagan Divinities from Petrarch to Chaucer," Speculum, 32, 1957, p. 515). 346</page><page sequence="25">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE and his work reproduces the physical and moral universe of man. Not only are the heavens themselves represented but the life-controlling forces of the constellations and the planets are also outlined in precious stones: Ibi ceu lumina septem Que vaga mundus habet, septem faber ordine gemmas Clauserat ingenio, nondum lapis, optimus Athlas. (Africa III1.115-17) And there with craft, ere he was turned to stone, had Atlas set seven gems to ape the seven spinning stars. (lines 116-18) Although this is a description in pagan terms, the dazzling montage contained in the golden palace constitutes an attempt to sum up the entire gamut of moral and intellectual virtues with which the epic hero was to be imbued. The orbis formed by the precious stones represents the heavenly orders, and at its very center stands a huge carbuncle, representing the Sun, while two other bright lights represent Venus and the Moon (lines 113-15). Beyond these appear the twelve pagan constellations (lines 111-36), followed by fourteen pagan divinities to whom Petrarch alludes as gods and heroes (lines 138-39) ; then a series of mythological creatures such as Pegasus, the Gorgons, and Perseus. These descriptions occupy some 105 lines (lines 138-242) and are fol- lowed by a representation of the underworld. Finally, two more lines explain that what Scipio has seen so far represents earth, heaven, and hell. Bernardo argues persuasively for the symbolic value of this repre- sentation. He concurs with Festa's theory that the passages represent a misplacement of lines which originally belonged in another section of the poem and constituted a representation of a Palace of Truth. Bernardo finds the journey to this realm of Truth complementary to Scipio's earlier dream. According to this symmetry Petrarch intended to have Scipio travel to the palace in order "to come in contact with human and divine wisdom (just as in the first books the dream transports him directly to heaven and makes him understand the moral order of the world)" (B, p. 130). Three arguments (first presented by Festa) to the effect that this is indeed a realm of Truth refer to matters contained within the text: that the descriptions of the astronomical bodies have moral force, that they are misplaced in a purely decorative context, and that the creator of the palace is Atlas. The fourth argument advanced by Festa concerns a reference Pe- trarch made elsewhere to such a realm. In the Secretumr, the lady Truth introduces herself to Franciscus as follows: 347</page><page sequence="26">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Illa ego sum--inquit-quamtu in Africa nostra curiosa quadam elegantia descrip- sisti; cui, non segnius quam Amphyon ille dirceus, in extreme quidem occidentis summoque Atlantis vertice habitationem clarissimam atque pulcerrimam mirabili artificio ac poeticis, ut proprie dicam, manibus erexisti.4l (I am the one whom in your Africa you depicted with loving elegance; the one for whom with wonderful art and, as it were, with poetic hands, you built, no differently than Theban Amphion of old, a most splendid and beautiful abode, in the extreme west, on the loftiest peak of Mount Atlas.) Nowhere else in Petrarch's epic poem is such a description to be found. Festa concludes therefore that since it is natural to expect the creation of Atlas to be replete with wisdom, and since the truth value of its parts is affirmed in a number of features (such as the carbuncle which is a medieval symbol of truth), this palace is where the Secretum locates the realm of Truth.43 Bernardo notes that Scipio's forced land- ing, described by Livy, on an island off the coast of Carthage, harmon- izes not only with the location of the domain in Africa but also with the distinct references both in the Secretum and in the description itself, and with the facts that the palace was to be found on the highest peak of Mount Atlas and that Atlas had made its wonders. Such a journey to Truth would echo similar journeys by ancient epic heroes and cohere at the same time with Christian symbolism (possibly entering into a dialectical relation with Ulysses' journey in Dante's Commedia). It fuses in turn with classical legend as inherited by medie- val readers and with the idea of Mount Atlas as the place where prisci poetae imagined a resort of the gods, with the entire conception of its privileged height and depth, and with the conception of Atlas the as- tronomer. These aspects of the realm of truth would not conflict with the geographical belief in Atlas as the westernmost boundary of the known world; indeed, they would carry out the idea that he signifies the limitations set on knowledge. The arguments of Festa and Bernardo establish convincingly that the realm of Atlas described in Africa is indeed that of Truth. The other mythological representations contained in the palace are not allegorized, and Bernardo points out that Petrarch successfully avoids the euhemer- istic interpretation of the gods which had enjoyed so considerable a vogue throughout the Middle Ages.44 It is arguable that since here 42 Petrarch, De secreto conflictu curarum mearum, Bk. I, pars. 3-4; in Ponte, p. 433. 43 Festa, Africa, pp. lxvii-viii. 44 This kind of interpretation originated in a Latin translation by Ennius of Euhemerus (ca. 300 B.C.), who had maintained that the gods were ordinary mor- tals excelling in unusual prowess and pursuits. The doctrine reached its culmina- tion in Lactantius and Isidore. See John D. Cooke, "Euhemerism: A Medieval Interpretation of Classical Paganism," Speculum, 2 (1927), 396-410. 348</page><page sequence="27">ARIOSTO'S ATLANTE Petrarch saves the pagan divinities from possible demotion to mere mythologized human beings, the palace of Truth (if such it is) also offers a purified philology that is worthy of its classical predecessors. And the marriage of Mercury and Philology celebrated in that passage of Africa, seems a persuasive echo of that effort. Petrarch does not seem to draw any moral effects directly from con- sideration of the pagan myths. In that connection Bernardo remarks on the double focus provided by pagan and Christian viewpoints, that "while in his dream Scipio sees Truth as willed by an Almighty Creator, in the palace he sees Truth as conceived by the pagan mind" (p. 148). A dual view of Truth is implied, though Petrarch does not refer to internal contradictions. Is it not possible that the Truth Scipio sees in the palace, which reinstates the pagan gods in roles divested of medieval allegoriz- ing, is of a chiefly philological kind? Then the lady Truth of the Secre- tumn would remember it as incomplete and the Franciscus of the Secre- turn would have more reason to wonder whether he should continue the Africa to its end. Not only Truth appears doubled here. Curiously, Petrarch seems to have produced the same kind of overlapping representation of Atlas that Ovid had produced in the Metamorphoses. On his way to Atlas' domain Perseus already rested in the shade of the Mountain. And in the realm of Truth, Atlas, who created it, is already represented as a marmoreus senex among the various figures, including the Gorgons and Pegasus. Ariosto continues the doubling process by representing At- lante the magician and Mount Atlas with the same simultaneity. It is tempting to conjecture a realm of illusion constructed in Orlando furioso in express opposition to the realm of truth in Africa. The idea of a fabled domain distinguished by riches and an isolated location furnished by Plato's extended account of Atlantis seems complicated by the fact that Plato expresses belief in its actuality. Plato does not question the previous existence of Atlantis; its truth in Timaeus and Critias is to be taken at face value. This is not the case with Petrarch's invention, which stresses its cosmological importance and makes claims for comprehensive knowledge. If Festa and Bernardo are correct (as I believe they are) in assuming that Petrarch built a realm of Truth on Mount Atlas and at that textual locus, then the suggestive potential of such a creation for Ariosto's palazzo of illusions would be self- explanatory. But Ariosto's reading of the mythological Atlas seems to differ in at least one major respect from Petrarch's. Whereas Petrarch does indeed restore the pagan giant to something resembling his grandeur in Ovid, Ariosto returns instead, and with renewed vigor, to the medieval alle- 349</page><page sequence="28">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE gorizations. To say that he debunks these readings is only part of the story; it is more accurate to say that he deconstructs them only so far as is necessary for him to create meaning, for deconstruction alone is a negative which by itself has nothing to do with the creation of new meaning. Atlante contains many old euhemerized meanings of Atlas that have to coexist with the Atlases of Homer, of Virgil, and of Ovid. Ariosto really seems to add-in addition to the sadly comical trans- formation of Atlas into a fairy-wizard and then an ailing old soul- little more than the fact that Atlante dies. And what could be more "euhemeristic" than the death of Atlante ? His end extends and expands the old Petrarchan awareness of the transitoriness of all things, their fluctuations and inevitable metamor- phoses. It coheres perfectly with the idea that the gods themselves are impermanent by nature-or with the idea that literature can claim for itself the ability to destroy them. In the context of literature gods can also be no more than mortal. So if Atlante in Orlando furioso can be viewed as a degenerate trope, according to the downward trajectory taken from Atlas to Atlante, remember that Ruggiero and Bradamante are taking the opposite, upward course, buoyed up to their human limitations by their poet. Somewhere on their contrary journeys they meet on neutral ground. Atlas the mountain and ocean, the marker of outermost limits, the giant, the astronomer and seer, the king, the "Moor," and the ad hoc allegory of God the Father, Atlas' orchard with its golden trees of philosophie-all find their place somewhere in the nexus of interpreta- tion that truly constitutes an atlas of meanings. Ariosto decided that the female of the sorcerer's kind, Alcina, was to live forever against even her own will (Of X.49-55), in accordance, perhaps, with precedents which affirm that Medusa, or the Eternal Feminine, or its negative effects will perdure in the world. But Atlante although exceptional is only a man, and stands as such for his own illusionary world. That world will survive him, re-creatable in other places and times, void of center or circumference, at the pleasure of other demiurges. The prece- dents do not foresee his demise, and by breaking from them Ariosto shows the autonomy and ubiquity, in the mind of the builder, of worlds of delusion where happiness is exclusively pursued. Far from destroying Atlas, the new poetic context reinterprets his totality as a literary sign with painstaking literalness. Finally, Ariosto reads into the simultaneity of the giant and the mountain a tribute to literary petrification, Medusa's tallest monument. New York University 350</page></plain_text>
