<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME RECENT TRENDS IN SWEDISH FOLK STUDIES R. U. SAYCE (Paper read before the Society at a Meeting held at Exeter College, Oxford, on Yune 23rd, 1943) DURING recent years, there has arisen in Sweden a new school of folk- lorists, of which Professor C. W. von Sydow may be taken as a dis- tinguished representative. Much discussion of a fundamental kind has taken place concerning the nature and origin of folklore. Some of the points at issue are dealt with in the pages of Folkminnen och Folktankar, and Professor von Sydow has recently discussed others at some length 1 in the first two volumes of the new publication, Folk-Kultur, which is published by Lunds Universitets Folkminnesarkiv. It is not possible to review in one paper all the problems that are being raised, but I shall try to trace one or two threads of the argument, in order to indicate the general trend of the new criticism. Some of the recommendations made by the new school may not be entirely new, but they have received new emphasis. I will refer to four of them. (I) It is as important for the folklorist as for the historian that he shall examine his sources with the greatest care. He must consider writers' qualifications, their training, their ability to weigh evidence, and the opportunities they have had to acquire an intimate knowledge of what they have described. We must give to the study of European cultures the same seriousness and careful preparation that we give to the study of African or Melanesian cultures. (2) We must be careful with our terminology and use words, as far as possible, with definite and constant connotations. (3) It is particularly necessary to apply the principle of classification to folklore as we do to other sciences. (4) The new school attaches the greatest importance to the necessity of knowing intimately the people we are studying, whether these are pre- literate peoples in Africa or " folk " in Europe. Items 2 and 3 may be taken together, quite briefly. No one will deny the desirability of classification ; " the progress of knowledge is largely a matter of making distinctions." 2 In 900oo, Marett 3 stressed the need for subdivision and classification in folklore, when he called attention to a phase of early religion that " only needs clearly marking off by the aid of a few technical designations, to serve as a rallying point for a quantity of facts that have hitherto largely ' gone about loose '." Though, as he said, " definitions of words are always troublesome," our studies have benefited 1 C.

Marett: Pre-animistic Religion: Folk-Lore. 19oo. 378</page><page sequence="2">Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies 379 by his distinction between animatism and animism. Professor von Sydow, who was trained in the Natural Sciences, wishes to carry further this process of subdivision, and to introduce several new terms with clearly defined meanings. This he thinks is necessary because there are different kinds of traditions, which follow their own laws in connection with origin, diffusion, and survival. Malinowski,4 speaking of the school of Nature-Mythology, said that it confused " several clearly distinguishable types of story, the fairy-tale, the legend, the saga, and the sacred tale or myth." The older workers used categories that were too wide and grouped together dissimilar traditions. This, von Sydow thinks, was one of the causes of the confusion that fell upon mythology and led scholars to turn away to the study of rites, in the hope that these might be more tangible and less subject to change. Unless we take care, however, we may be led into similar errors. Rites are nearly as liable to change as are myths. For instance, the rites of the first-fruits in Natal vary in detail from tribe to tribe, and even from year to year within one tribe. In fact, it is known that in recent times the military element has come to preponderate over the agricultural.5 Moreover, Professor von Sydow claims that we must distinguish between several elements that have sometimes been grouped together under the term, rite. The essential kernel of a rite can receive accretions of various kinds, such as elements due to the whims of individuals, to pure festiveness without any deeper meaning, and even to youthful prank. Many festive customs are intended mainly for the amusement of young people, at least nowadays. An informant who grew up in Norfolk told me that the last sheaf from every farm in the parish was placed in church near the altar, and presumably formed part of the harvest offer- ings or decorations. In one part of Yorkshire the grain from the last sheaf was made into Communion bread. In both these cases we are dealing with Christian modifications of, or accretions about, an earlier kernel. Professor von Sydow deals in some detail with several varieties of tradition, which he claims should be distinguished from real myths.6 These include a number of pure fictions, which are told for various reasons. For them he suggests the term, fikt, which is simple, is not handicapped by pre-existing shades of meaning, and can be easily under- stood internationally. I will quote a few of his examples. (a) The Handworterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubns records that in Biel (Switzerland) people say that, when the sky is red in the evening, God the Father is frying small children. The German writer interprets this as a survival, but von Sydow says it is simply a irreverent jest, associated with the red sky, and told with the intention of shocking people a little. In Swabia, on similar occasions, they say that the Mother of God is cooking chickens. A white cloud in western Bohemia is said to indicate 4 B. Malinowski: Myth in Primitive Psychology, p. 15. 5 E.

No one really believes statements like these, and they should not be regarded as decayed myths. (b) Jesting fikts may be associated with beings in which people really believe. When a storm has thrown up masses of foam along the coast of Sweden, they say that the sea-woman (havsfru) is washing clothes. There is no doubt in the popular mind about the existence of the havsfru, but no one believes that the foam was caused by her washing; the two traditions are of different kinds. In Skane, if a countryman hears a crash in the woods or the screech of a bird, he says that the forest-man (skogsman) is beating his wife.7 (c) When there is mist in the forest, it is said that the hares, or the foxes, are brewing, though no one accepts this as a statement of fact. Mist or fog arising from a bog is caused by the moss-hag brewing, or firing her kiln. Here the moss-hag is herself an invention. No one believes in her existence and there are no stories about her appearance or doings. She is female because brewing is women's work, though this does not apply to the firing of kilns. (d) The foregoing fictions are told mainly for amusement, but there are others that serve a more or less useful purpose. For instance, to satisfy children's curiosity in England we tell them that babies come with the post-man, or were found under a gooseberry bush; in Sweden a stork brings them from a spring or well. No adults, not even men, believe this. The statements serve an obvious purpose, though some folklorists, von Sydow says, have considered the bird to be a fertility spirit ; it would be still more difficult to connect a post-man with a fertility cult. (e) One of the pedagogic fikts has practically become a test case between the two schools in Sweden. Children are told not to go near the well lest the old man of the well (brunnsgubbe) should take them. The orthodox school is inclined to compare the well-man with the river-horse and to regard him as an illegitimate birth among the tribe of water-spirits -a sort of back formation. Against Professor von Sydow's opinion that he is a pure fiction, designed to keep children away from the well where they might come to harm, Professor M. P. Nilsson argues that, if this were true, the river-horse would have still greater reason for being con- sidered a fikt, since the rivers drown more children than do the wells. Von Sydow denies this; the river-horse is a well established belief, and is recorded in south-west Sweden, Denmark, the Shetlands, and Iceland; he also occurs in Eire. He is usually a white horse who lives in the rivers and grazes in the evenings on the banks. He entices people to get on his back when he rushes off with them into the river. Icelanders cross these mares with the river-horse; the progeny are grand field workers, but are of no use for riding because one could not cross a river on them. The river-horse can be controlled and put to ploughing if an iron bit is put in his mouth. There are no such stories about the well-man who is just a fiction for children; von Sydow says he belongs to the same class as the window-man (finstergubbe) in Stockholm, who was invented to prevent children from climbing into the windows and falling out. Moreover, I C. W. von Sydow: Overnaturliga Visen : Nordisk Kultur. XIX.</page><page sequence="4">Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies 381 people do not joke about the river-horse lest they offend him and come to harm. The parallel between the well-man and the window-man em- phasises von Sydow's opinion that we should not confine our studies to one group of beliefs or rites. The foregoing argument appears to be quite reasonable. There is, however, one question I should like to ask our Swedish colleagues. Is there any possibility of the well-man being a much faded survival? In Britain and other parts of Europe there have been many supernatural associates of wells and springs in the way of saints, fairies, supernatural fish or frogs, etc. Two instances will suffice. Tobar-fuar-m6r, a well in Aberdeenshire,8 is fed by three springs about a yard apart. They were guarded by a spirit that lived under a stone between two of them. The well would effect no cure unless the patient presented gold to the spirit. In Rumania a spirit is said to preside over every well. When a woman draws water, she spills a few drops in homage to the spirit.9 Professor von Sydow's fourth point is not a new one, but it is well that attention should be drawn to it from time to time. It is clear that we should know intimately the people we are studying. Recent develop- ments suggest that the barrier between urban professional people and those who live in the more crowded parts of our cities or the men and women of the countryside is not negligible. We must know peoples' occupations, the stresses and trials they endure, and their whole manner of feeling, thinking, and speaking. To illustrate this subject von Sydow discusses the skogsrd (waldgeist, forest spirit). The skogsra, skogsfru, or skogsnuva is a solitary spirit that men sometimes meet in the forest. She generally appears as a beautiful young woman, though, seen from behind, she is foul and her back is hollow or appears to resemble a stump of rotting wood. She is a temptress and lures men to love, but such as succumb to her allurements are liable to become mentally deranged. A case is reported where a man who was prevented from going to meet her threw himself into a hole in the ice, but was eventually pulled out cured. There are many records of judiciary proceedings against men who had inter- course with the skogsnuva, and severe punishments were inflicted. The orthodox school in Sweden appears to regard the skogsnuva as a personification of the forest, a vegetation spirit, and as having something to do with fertility. She might be compared with the havsfru (sea- woman) and the bergfru (hill-woman). The Finnish school is inclined to connect her with the spirits of the dead.10 Professor von Sydow suggests another explanation. He points out that the skogsnuva occurs mostly in the southern third of Sweden where it is most usual for men to be engaged for considerable lengths of time in solitary work in the forest, such as charcoal-burning and tar-burning; here women only go into the forest for short periods to pick berries. He considers that the belief in question originates in erotic hallucinations which have formed a nucleus about which other beliefs have collected, 8 Gregor : Guardian Spirits of Wells and Lochs : Folk-Lore, I892. 9 Gregor : op cit., quoting from E. Gerard : The Land Beyond the Forest, I888. 10 Gunnar Grannberg : Skogsrdet i yngre Norsk Folktradition.</page><page sequence="5">382 Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies such as those concerned with her power over wild animals, her control of hunting-luck, and her tendency to pixy-lead men. This latter attribute is transferred to the river-horse in Skine. The skogsnuva is not so well known in Dalarna, where it is the girls who spend long periods at the cattle-posts. A more characteristic experience for a herd-girl is suddenly to hear the sounds of horns and cow-bells and to see another girl driving a herd of cattle. When she goes to meet and welcome the newcomer, everything disappears-an example of expect- ance-hallucination. It would be interesting to consider what part hallucinatory experiences have played in British folklore and their connection with the local ways of life; for example, in the stories of Llangorse Lake and of Llyn y Fan in Wales. Andrew Lang, the first President of this Society, attributed much importance to hallucinations. " One clear waking hallucination . . would tell more with the early philosopher than a score of dreams, for to be easily forgotten is the essence of a dream.""1 We must recognise that hallucinations can occur to apparently normal people. In the past, when food shortages were common, and when people were subjected more frequently to extremes of cold, fatigue, or loneliness, such experiences may have been more common. The present war has produced many instances of shipwrecked sailors exposed in open boats to physical hardships seeing visionary ships coming to their relief, and one man says that he distinctly saw a glass of beer floating by and stretched out his hand to grasp it. It appears that some of the visions can be com- municated, that, when one man says he sees a ship, others will see it. Gadelius 12 describes an interesting case of a woman who believed she was persecuted by a " lover-spirit " which a citizen of the same town set on to her by means of a miraculous power which she compared with witch- craft. This spirit " made what she experienced on this and many following nights as distinct and natural as if X in person had been in bed with her. It was not a dream, for she was wide awake, and she both heard and saw." It was later decided that the woman was suffering from schizophrenia. Perhaps many of the mediaeval incubi and succubi have similar explana- tions. The question at issue between the two schools of folklore in Sweden is not whether hallucinations occur, but about their frequence and their importance for the folklorist. The orthodox school, of course, admits the fact of hallucinations, but tends to claim that their contents are determined by the accepted beliefs. Protestants and Roman Catholics would have different hallucinations; so would American Indians and Europeans. One would not have, they would say, a hallucination of the skogsra unless one believed in her. I feel that this is a forcible argument, and Professor von Sydow does not deny that beliefs condition hallucina- tions, but he asks us to give more study to these phenomena and also to pay closer attention to the actual life of the people. A man passing a joiner's shop in the evening may think that he hears 11 The Making of Religion. 12 Bror Gadelius: Human Mentality, pp. 142-3.</page><page sequence="6">Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies 383 the sound of hammering. This may happen irrespective of any belief in spirits and may be an illusion or hallucination associated with custom or expectance. On entering the shop, he finds that all is still; no one visible has gone out, so the mind may turn to spirits. Nightmares and bad dreams do not depend on a belief in a nightmare. Von Sydow claims, therefore, that the skogsra originated in erotic hallucinations that have happened to men living in solitude. The beautiful vision was obviously not a normal creature, and, since the experience took place in the forest, she naturally becomes the forest-woman or wood-wife. The writer just mentioned has elsewhere l3 dealt at some length with the basis in experi- ence of many other supernatural beings. There will probably be differences of opinion about some of the new theories, but there is little doubt that we have had a timely reminder to seek an intimate knowledge of the folk, of their manner of thought and speech, of the ways in which ideas and motives intertwine, and of the mingling of the light and the serious. Every activity must be studied in detail, but we must never allow one aspect of culture or one group of customs to interfere with our vision of the whole culture. We shall now turn to consider the attitude of the new school toward some of the beliefs and practices associated with the corn-spirit and the last sheaf. Space will only allow reference to a few of these, and it will not be possible to discuss any one at length. The corn-spirit When Tylor published his great work, Primitive Culture, Mannhardt was collecting and investigating rural customs in Germany, and he was strongly influenced by Tylor's theories of animism and survivals. Later, Frazer made much use of the German researches. Although Marett struck a cautionary note in I900oo,14 and warned us that we might overdo animis- tic interpretations and be too prone to detect survivals and fading rudimen- tary forms, animism figures largely in British folklore. The living corn is commonly said to be animated by a spirit which could appear separately in human or animal form. When the corn was being cut this spirit retreated before the reapers to its final refuge in the last clump of corn left standing in the field. The spirit was then driven away to seek a dwelling in the standing corn on another farm or it was thought to be slain when the last corn was cut-or when the last sheaf was threshed- or apparently it was preserved in the corn-maiden, corn old wife, corn- dolly, etc., which was made from the last sheaf and kept in the farm until it was finally disposed of, which was done at various dates and in different ways. Let us see what explanations the new school offers of these prac- tices. When the wind waves the corn, people say the goats are chasing each other, the steer is running through the corn, there runs the horse, the 18 Overnaturliga VAsen : Nordisk Kultur, XIX, pp. 95-159. 14 Folk-Lore, 19oo.</page><page sequence="7">384 Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies boar is rushing through the corn,15 the wolf is hunting through the corn. Frazer claimed that there are other manifestations of the corn-spirit, as well as those mentioned, but von Sydow says that no adult believes in these animals, not even when some one dresses up as a corn-hag to give visible proof to children. We are probably right in believing-although one critic is inclined to deny it-that children have at all times been tempted to stray into stand- ing corn either for concealment and play, or to pluck the ears of corn or gather the blue corn-flowers and red poppies. To discourage them from doing this and trampling the corn, they have been told in many parts of Scandinavia, Central Europe, Russia, etc. that the corn wolf would tear them, the corn-cock would peck out their eyes, the rye-goat or bean-goat is sitting there and would carry them away' ; or the corn-mother, corn- hag, old man of the field (dkergubbe), etc. would take them away in a basket, or a sack, blind them, or kill them with a stick."' The new school says that these statements are partly jests, partly fictions intended to prevent children from doing damage to the crops. In the Golden Bough we read (p. 448) that when a wolf ran through a cornfield in East Prussia, dragging its tail on the ground. the peasants thanked him for a blessing and laid tit-bits before him ; but if he carried his tail high they cursed him and tried to kill him. Frazer says the wolf's fertilising power was in his tail. Might this practice be interpreted merely as an example of omen taking, without considering the wolf as being in any way related to the corn-spirit? The last sheaf (a) Rivalry. There is no need to remind readers of the customs, and their many variations, associated with the last sheaf. It is, however, very helpful if we have clear pictures of the harvest scenes. Are we dealing with open, common fields, or with separate enclosures? Are the reapers at work on adjacent rigs or is a group reaping one enclosed field? It is not easy to construct accurate pictures from many of the descriptions which we read. The love of a competition is latent in nearly everyone, and, if we may follow MacDougall,1s is probably associated with the instinct of pugnacity and self-display. Examples easily come to mind of rivalry between individuals, between farms, and between parishes. When men and women are working together, especially if they are young, there may very naturally be competition to be the first to finish, or, perhaps quite as often, to avoid being the last. This might be merely an expression of joy in one's strength and skill. Jung 19 has pointed out, too; that where the people working together are all experts in the same craft, every one will 15 Golden Bough (Abridged Edition) : Chapter XLVIII. 16 Golden Bough. 17 C. W. von Sydow in Folk-Kultur, quoting from Mannhardt: Mythologische Forschungen. 18 Social Psychology. 19 J. Jacobi: The Psychology of Jung.</page><page sequence="8">Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies 385 have a special desire to excel in the opinions of the others. He suggests that much indifferent work nowadays is due to men working without having the eyes of equally expert workers constantly on them. The new school claims that this desire to excel is sufficient to explain much of the striving to be first to finish the reaping, and of the shout of triumph which lets the neighbours know that work is finished. Professor von Sydow says that there are similar triumphant shouts in Sweden when the hay has been mown. It is recorded that in Aberdeenshire reapers used to throw their hooks into the air to frighten the invisible hare or corn-spirit away into the nearest uncut corn.20 I think the new school would consider this, too, as simply an expression of joy. Mr. T. Hennell seems to provide support for such an interpretation.21 He tells us how the sheep-shearers move from farm to farm in the neighbourhood; " ... at the end of the last day's work they throw up their hats as a sign that the season's work is ended ... " " This throwing-up of the cap is a last vestige of a custom in use at the old sheep-shearing festivals, at which an empty drinking-horn was thrown into the air in the cap and caught as it came down." It would be possible to interpret in a similar way the desire to avoid being last and showing oneself a feeble or unskilful worker. This applies to individuals and to teams on the several farms. Some of our British records could be taken as supporting this view. In Skye, in 1795, the first farm to finish reaping sent a bundle of corn to a neighbour. This was a brag and an affront.22 The sending of the Lame Goat to another farm in Skye and in parts of the Highlands carried, not an implication of bad luck, but one of humiliation.23 In North Cardiganshire the tuft was always sent towards the sea, i.e. downhill, and it was a disgrace for a lowland farm to be behind an upland neighbour.24 The feeling of humiliation might explain the resentment shown by the people of a farm on which a cailleach had been thrown. There are several records that the thrower had to run away quickly because the infuriated reapers flung their sickles after him.25 In the days when people in Skye gave the landlord boon service, if a lame goat was put on a neighbouring landlord's field a free fight generally followed.26 (b) Festivity. After the last standing corn had been cut, it was made into a maiden, dolly, old wife, wolf, goat, etc. In Perthshire it was sometimes allowed to fall to one of the finest girls in the field and borne in triumph to the music of fiddles and bagpipes to the farm.27 The corn- dolly was put in the house above the mantle, on the Harvest Supper table, in the Grange, etc. All this is interpreted as a manifestation of 20 M.

Banks : op. cit., p. 73- 2B</page><page sequence="9">386 Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies the feeling of joy which is natural at the conclusion of a period of very hard work, and at 'the prospect of a well-earned feast. Probably, too, there would be thankfulness that the period of scarcity which often preceded harvest was over. Professor von Sydow points out also that much routine work on the farms is by custom allotted separately to men and women. In harvest the two sexes came together in the sunshine, and this might contribute another element of jollity and even give opportun- ity for some kissing, not all of a ritualist character. (c) Omens. Many, if not most, festivities are occasions for observing omens, and it is not strange that the practice should be associated with harvest and harvest-home, which represent such an important stage in the economic and emotional life. It is often said that some misfortune-poverty, sickness, or death in the family or among the stock-will befall the reaper of the last corn. Now the first and the last in many connections attract particular atten- tion,28 e.g. first-foot, first cuckoo, first moon, first lamb, etc. Mrs. Banks records that misfortune is believed to fall on him who is the last to finish any kind of work,29 and that people in North Uist say, " We put the Cailleach on them " when they have beaten their neighbours in any task. In Aberdeenshire he who took home the last load or sheaf was afraid of falling into the hands of the Devil.30 Swedish country people often give the last reaper a nickname that was derogatory-lus, krdklort, rdgkodd- and seemed to have no necessary connection with fertility. It is perhaps natural that people who are so laggard or weak as to be the last to finish harvest will be late or inefficient with other work, and so are not likely to prosper. Is " the dearth of the township " a concrete expression of their lack of success? If not, what does this term mean? Mrs. Banks mentions that in Glencoe people said that he who got the cailleach was doomed to poverty for his lack of energy. There was, too, a materialistic reason why a peasant who was behind- hand with his work might experience misfortune. When the grain had been reaped in the old open-fields, the stubble became common pasture and the cattle of the village or township were turned on to it ; they would not respect any part of the field on which the harvest still stood. At Lax~ton " To prevent a general hold-up in the interest of a few laggards, it was a custom that the fields might be broken, if necessary, before the last two farmers had finished carrying their corn."31 Much of the divination associated with cutting the corn-maiden has to do with marriage, but has this any connection with a fertility-cult or the corn-spirit? Professor von Sydow reminds us that many of those engaged in the harvest-fields are young, and that their phantasy-life turns largely on the subject of husbands or wives. It is, therefore, quite easy to understand that they should look for signs indicating who shall be married within the year and what kind of partners they will obtain. We 28 C.

Orwin : The Open Fields.</page><page sequence="10">Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies 387 can also see why the last to finish should make a poor marriage. In Sweden they say that the last man at the reaping will marry an old hag or a harlot, and the last girl will have illegitimate children or her husband will be a widower or a beggarman. There are many other occasions on which young people try to foresee their future marriage. Omens are also observed at the reaping to see who shall die during the year, and to discover the direction of the farm on which the man will reap the following year. (d) Jest. We have seen that the new school considers some of the statements about animals (or spirits) in the corn to be fictions for children, told partly in jest. By extension, it is claimed, some of these jests may be applied to adults. Reaping was very hard work and might often cause fatigue and strained muscles. If a reaper gets a pain in the back, this is not a punishment sent by the corn-spirit, though it is said jocularly that the " (corn) wolf has bitten him." Could this argument be applied to some British customs? In parts of Scotland the driver of the last load was roughed; in some cases dirty water was thrown over him.32 The use of water might be interpreted by some as rain-magic, but does not the use of dirty water suggest a " ragging " element? At a Mummers' Festival-the Hunting of the Earl of Rome-the fool and hobby-horse took money from the onlookers, and spattered dirty water over anyone who refused to give.33 Mrs. Banks also records 34 that in some places in Scotland the last carter has his face blacked. The last load was pelted with rotten eggs in north-east Scot- land.35 The latter custom, too, might be associated with fertility, but this can hardly have been the idea behind the use of eggs in connection with the pillory, nor is it likely to have been intended to increase the number of votes of a political opponent. The foregoing notes touch briefly on only a few points, but I hope that they will indicate, not unfairly, the general nature of some recent thought in Sweden. This deserves our consideration because it is based on many years' careful study of the information which has accumulated so copi- ously in the Swedish archives. It is, of course, possible that British folklorists will not agree with everything that has been put forward, but it seems to me clear that Professor von Sydow has done good service in calling for more careful study of the several elements interwoven in folk- customs. It would be extremely interesting if we could re-examine the old harvest customs-and many others as well. What did the people feel and think about each practice? Westermarck 36 said that experience in Morocco brought home to him " the great lesson, which no field-anthropologist should forget, not to rest content with recording mere external modes of 32 M. M. Banks : op. cit., p. 85. 33 British Calendar Customs (England), p. 144. 34 M. M. Banks: op. cit., p. 85. 35 M. M.

Unfortunately most of the customs have disappeared from Britain. Is there any hope that some- thing may have survived in Eire? Some of our European colleagues may have better opportunities. When we consider peoples' mental reactions we must bear in mind the possibility that there may be considerable regional differences, due to racial and historical factors. Mrs. M. M. Banks pointed out in 1934 that harvest customs in Scotland were " always remembered as of extreme importance and with seriousness.""37 Does the spirit reflected in Carmina Gadelica, saturated as it is with deep religious feeling, find a counterpart in Sweden? What effects have the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches had on peoples' attitude to nature? Historical changes require more attention than they have received of late years in this country. A jest or a fikt is, of course, not necessarily modern. Our ancestors could enjoy a laugh, and their children could stray into cornfields or tumble into wells. We must enquire, however, whether the popular conception of the universe has changed. What has been the effect on folk-thought of Christian doctrines of the soul, of angels, and of one omnipresent God? Would these render unnecessary postulates about vegetation-spirits? The idea of mana would probably survive much more generally. Gr"nbech,38 dealing with early scientific beliefs, writes " the science of' Greece and Rome has filtered into popular belief through the monks to such an extent that all inferences are vain...", until the botany'and zoology of Hellenism have been thoroughly examined. It is clear that some folk-customs, as they have occurred in recent times in Sweden and elsewhere, do include a considerable element of jests and festive pranks. The modern countryman may see in the hare that bolts from the last clump of standing corn, not the embodiment of the corn spirit, but something useful for the pot, as I remember reapers in Montgomeryshire doing with the rabbits. Did the harvest ceremonies, however, contain nothing more for our pagan ancestors? Did these hold no animistic beliefs about trees and plants? Professor von Sydow is inclined to answer the latter question in the negative. He says, " Mannhardt's material must be interpreted orendisti- cally, not animistically." 39 Marett emphasised the emotional as opposed to the ideational side of religion, and Frazer himself pointed out that most of the old agricultural practices are magical rather than religious; the corn-spirit has no name and nothing is told about its origin and character, nor are there any priests or temples. According to Professor Uno Harva, whom von Sydow quotes, Finnish marriage customs are not intended to woo a. spirit of fertility but are entirely directed to warding off witchcraft. Is Gr6nbech right, then, to warn us against the danger of being unduly influenced by the anthropomorphic tendencies of Hellenistic philosophy? Vilhelm Grinbech, who was professor of the History of Religion at the "7 International Congress of Anthropology and Ethnology: London 1934, p. 299. 38 Culture of the Old Teutons, Part III, p. 83. 39 International Congress of Anthropology and Archaeology : London 1934, p. 298-</page><page sequence="12">Some Recent Trends in Swedish Folk Studies 389 University of K6benhavn, offers us a picture of the old Teutons, which is of considerable interest.40 Our rigid dualism, he says, distorts primitive psychology. To the Teutons, soul implied power, will, influence, energy, life, existence itself; " to take life from a stone is the same as making it vanish into absolute nothingness." The idea of a thing being dead would not occur to them. We are further deluded by our propensity to use the singular abstract noun. The life of different things is not a common essence, bringing them together; it is specific and keeps them apart. Human appearance " enters as a quality among other qualities into the soul of the earth, wind and sea, but it does not in the least interfere with the impersonal workings of the forces of nature." There is one other point that may be mentioned. For the old Teutons, as Gr6nbech depicts them, identity has a deeper foundation than mere continuance. Every new appearance of a bear is a creation from bear-soul; a bear is a new creation every time it appears. Similarly, every day the appearing sun is born afresh. " The ' Winter-cold ' who is winter's father and' Summer- breeze ' who is summer's father are nothing but the everlasting soul that bursts into appearance at the proper time." Grdnbech quotes Professor Jan de Vries 41 as saying that for the heathen Germans there was no dead and living nature; they knew only " eine beseelte Natur." In this view of the universe the distinction between animatism and animism become rather blurred. If, however, the Swedish, Danish, and Dutch professors are all correct in their views, meditation on them should lead us on to some enthralling studies of the history of folklore, and this essay can conclude very appropriately with a quotation from Andrew Lang's preface to his book, The Making of Religion-" . .. no harm can come of trying how facts look from a new point of view. ..
