<plain_text><page sequence="1">Voania Muba: Contributions to the History of Central African Pottery For more than half a century, Voania's figural pottery, signed with his name, has been exhibited outside Africa as part of both private and museum collections. To date, however, there are no historical data on Voania himself. Even his ethnic background as assumed by the literature is incorrect; Voania was not a Kwakongo (Kakongo) potter but a Woyo personality. This paper is meant to be a tribute to this unknown artist as well as a more systematic study of Kongo pottery, whose historical depth and high esthetic quality remain over- shadowed by the interest in the Kongo magic objects (minkisi). Anthony Forge has outlined the shortcomings of both streams of cultural anthropology from the 1920s to the 1960s, the one practiced mainly at the universities and oriented to fieldwork, the other in the museums (1973: xii-xiv). The latter stream was mainly engaged in the identification of the indi- vidual features of works of art constituting various styles, and it abstained from any wider theoretical concerns. The former, on the other hand, drew theoretical conclusions about multifac- eted cultural phenomena, omitting one of the most significant parts of the culture: the art. While Forge found the cause of this disjunction in the diffusionist studies emphasized by the Austrian school of ethnography, which have made fieldwork an accessory if not a redundance, it is rather interesting to note that the "Viennese" school of art history (which was not limited to Vienna alone) at the same time played the opposite role in art historiography. Its scepticism and criticism of the sources, of which the work of art is the primary one, bound the student to the museum. Its historical relativism, on the other hand, committed the scholar to the study in depth of the milieu of origin and usage (be the milieu most remote in time or space), since it is its Kunstwollen and Geist to which the work of art relates and which it reflects. "The art does not only solve and develop formal tasks and problems. It is an expression of the ideas directing the men as well and, indeed, primarily so, and the history of art is part of the general spiritual history (Geistesgeschichte) no less than the history of religion, philosophy or poetry" (Dvorik 1924: x). This credo of Max Dvorak, which created the background for his own numerous superb papers, defined in an innovative way the scope of art historical study. The work of the potter Voania is, from a methodological point of view, a rather amusing case to study. First, it exemplifies the rigorous indivisibility of museum research and of work in situ as a sine qua non of historical work in African art. Having studied in the westernmost point of Zaire, where Voania had lived and worked, and in the southern part of Cabinda, I know that one may live there without having the slightest idea that the potter existed; his work is never found in the hands of African users, and the oral tradition, except for one little village, does not mention him. On the other hand, when working in museums outside of Africa, one gets the impression that Voania was one of the most prolific artists in Africa. Museums in Tervuren, Antwerp, London, Zurich and Amsterdam, for example, abound in his figural pottery, which is signed mostly in large, incised block letters VOANIA MUBA. Secondly, the study of Voania's work and its testing in the field offer certain new perspectives in viewing African art, thus contributing to the definition of the authenticity of African art as a historical (that is, changeable in time and space) notion. Muba, where Voania lived and died, is a village on the road from Lukula in Mayumbe to Moanda on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The village is situated some five kilometers from the Cabinda border, between Kai Ndunda in Kwakongo and Tshikai in Ngoyo. Its inhabitants are the Bawoyo, who consider themselves as belonging to the old Ngoyo kingdom. The north-south border between the land of the Bawoyo and that of the Bakwakongo is close to the eastern edge of the village. The area around Muba resembles the not easily accessible Kwakongo land, which is hilly, wooded and has a great number of little streams, and differs from the sandy, flat :j,j mEe S * 0 59</page><page sequence="2">MUSEE ROYAL DE L'AFRIQUE CENTRALE. 36.5cm.

Muba is a village of average size, with some thirty houses, and is built along the road, as many Woyo villages are. Voania, or more correctly, Voanya, was the chief of Muba, referred to by the people of the village as mfumu ma kanda, the customary chief. The elders today insist that he started making pottery as an adult, when he was already chief, and practiced it until he was an old man. He died, according to the informants, in the year that the present chief of Muba, ntinu Dumu, who was Voanya's youngest nephew, was born, which would be 1928 or so. Thus the oral data correspond with the dates obtainable from the records on the collection of his early pottery. Dr. Elie J. Etienne, who started his Belgian colonial career in 1888, shipped some of Voanya's pottery to the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale in Tervuren in 1910, as recorded by H. Schouteden, the former museum director.1 According to both the oral tradition and the present findings, Muba evidently has never been a center of pottery. Voanya appears to have been its first and last potter. Indeed, pottery is not a Woyo specialty at all, and Muba is, to my knowledge, the only Woyo village where it was ever made. The sandy soil, which in the southeast exceeds the eastern Woyo border up to the village of Nzadi Kongo, and in the northeast starts approximately at the border between Ngoyo and Kwakongo, undoubtedly does not yield clay (tuma or ntuma). Clay is available in abundance, however, in Kwakongo, where major centers of pottery supplying the adjoining Woyo country are concentrated, and Muba's natural environment is like Kwakongo. My informants indicated to me the place in the forest, close to a stream, where Voanya derived his material; it was only some few hundred meters from the eastern edge of the village. Despite the availability of clay, Muba has con- formed to the traditional cultural patterns of the rest of the Woyo country, and has remained dependent for their ceramics upon the Bakwakongo.2 When working in Muba, I was able to find that all used terracotta objects in the village can be attributed to the potters of either Pwela or Lele Sikila, Kwakongo villages situated northeast of Muba. How does one, then, in view of the recent findings as well as the lack of an old tradition of Ngoyo pottery, interpret historically the appearance of the only Woyo potter Voanya? How does one explain why even his own village did not further develop or maintain the artistic tradition that he had intro- duced? Voanya, as the village elders kept repeating, had no teacher, no formal training. He also supposedly did not leave Muba, but simply started making pottery. Voanya, I was told, had lieya liambu, a term, as it became clear from the context, designat- ing talent (liambu = diambu or "message"). When he became a potter, Voanya worked in seclusion inside his chiefs house and did not wish to be observed. He died with his professional secrets, leaving no disciple. As he grew old, he used only one helper, his nephew Dumu Dioko, who was a very young boy at that time, and who is now an elder of Muba.3 The helper provided Voanya with potting clay and sand; the mixing process and the preparation of the potter's material were some of Voanya's jealously guarded secrets. To prove that he had not learned anything from his uncle, Mr. Dumu Dioko showed me three little pots that he once tried to make for his own use from the clay used by Voanya; they indeed testified to the truth of his statement. The major part of the nephew's share in Voanya's artistic activities, however, involved communication between the potter and the market. The helper walked for three days on a 61 I</page><page sequence="4">mum- * US U U U * U~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * -U-'- U regular basis to the markets at Boma and Banana, transporting Voanya's pottery. (The Bakongo pack pottery in palm leaves so ingeniously that it is never broken.) That Chief Voanya, as his village tradition depicts him, did not go to Boma and Banana, and that he never sold his pottery himself correspond to the custom that has survived to the present in Kongo country. Pottery in the centers in Kwakongo or in Manyanga is usually bought in bulk in the village of origin by a middleman (male or female), who then takes it to markets. Boma (Mboma in Kikongo) is an old Kongo marketplace that has been mentioned in the literature since the seventeenth century.4 After the beginning of the twentieth century, besides the traditional marketplace, which is now inside the town, several smaller markets developed closer to the port carrying merchandise for foreigners traveling on the boats. Some of these smaller trading places now survive in the neighborhood of the hotels. On the other hand, Banana, which in KiWoyo denotes a small palm tree that grows there in the sandy soil on the northern side of the mouth of the Congo River, was never a traditional Woyo marketplace. For almost five centuries it was a stopping place for boats from Europe and South America, and in the nineteenth century it was the location for a large Dutch, a French and two Portuguese trading houses (Giussfeldt 1879:36). The records of the end of the last century describe Banana as a cosmopolitan place with a prevalent European atmosphere (Giussfeldt 1879:37-38; Weeks 1969:17-18). Thus the market and the foreign trade houses, which no longer exist, undoubtedly also served the foreigners. Muba oral tradition confirms it by stating that Voanya made his pottery solely for the mundele, the white man, and not for the African clientele. Voanya's works do not show traces of usage. The damage present in some of them (cracks, broken bowl or figure, pieces knocked off) occurred presumably during transportation to Europe. Also, during all these years, I have not found a single piece made by Voanya in the hands or on the grave of a Bakongo. The quantity of his pottery was so surprising that the suggestion was raised that they were the work not only of Voanya but also of his helpers and followers, who were believed to have used his trademark. This conjecture was rightly opposed by A. Maesen, who attributed the set of Voanya's pottery to one person only, basing his argument on a formal analysis of the pieces (1951:8). My recent findings about Voanya also throw light on the disproportion between the high number of his works and the sculptures identifiable as works of another, anonymous Kongo potter or carver. The quantity of his preserved pottery does not reflect a predominant position within the history of Kongo art, nor does it qualify him as the most prolific Kongo sculptor. It is a logical consequence of his supplying European, rather than indigen- ous, demand. According to the former director of the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Dr. Elie J. Etienne, already mentioned as a collector of Voanya's clay sculptures, was a sort of promoter of the artist's work. It was also suggested that it might have been Dr. Etienne who had written out Voanya's name and the name of his village for him, thus encouraging the artist to sign his works.5 While the latter story is quite possible, Voanya does not seem to be the only artist at the turn of the century who marked his works with his name. Some foreigners who bought Kongo art objects in Banana or Boma probably considered the artist's name a proper complement to the souvenirs. The Reverend T. Hope Morgan, for instance, who stayed in Central Africa as a Protestant missionary from 1890 to 1912, bought a number of engraved gourds in Banana. Some SHANGO GALLERIES 2606 FAIRMOUNT DALLAS, TEXAS 75201 (214) 744-4891 FANG 62 I</page><page sequence="5">of them were signed, in a distorted way, with the engraver's name using English spelling.6 Both the stimulus and origin of Voanya's artistic production seem to have convincingly indigenous characteristics, with no persuading European intervention. The fact that Voanya as a male became involved with pottery testifies to the authenticity of its provenance. In the entire Kwakongo, as well as in the strip of land on the right bank of the river inhabited by the Bakongo, which goes to the east of Boma, pottery-making is explicitly and solely a male profession. The older and the more deep-rooted the potting tradition in a village of this area, the more strictly this rule seems to be applied. In some cases, I recorded the oral tradition defining a woman working with potting clay as committing a serious offense. Although the tradition is not specific about why it is an offense, one can conjecture that the reason may reside in the close tie between the earth, considered to be female and a mother, and the woman potter. In this region, the interaction and accumulation of female elements, which is desirable in the cultivation of the land, since harvest and pregnancy are Kongo semantic cog- nates, are presumably believed, in the case of pottery, to cause a disturbance of the male-female balance. As I was able to observe in the course of my field trips, the border in the northern part of the Kongo country between the area where pottery is made by males and where it is produced by women seems to go through Mayumbe southward to Matadi. East of Mayumbe, in Manyanga, as well as among the Bateke, potting is the work of women (Demetz 1951:260-271). Changing patterns in the sex of the potters may prove to have rather important historical implications. Recently, D. W. Phillipson tentatively suggested their possible interrelation with the tradition of the Early and later Iron Age in Zambia. He proposed that female potters have been the rule in the later Iron Age, while men might have been engaged with pottery in all currently recognized groups of the said area in the Early Iron Age (1974:21-25). As pottery is now commonly practiced by men, for instance also in the Ndembu, Lunda and Lovale clusters in western Zambia, and considering Phillipson's tempting suggestion, Voanya, as a male potter, appears to be no exception within the context of various Central African societies. Voanya's scrupulosity in staying away from the village inhabitants during his working process is also related to certain traditional prohibitions attached to potting (see Drost 1964:103-111). In Luangu, for instance, which is one of the centers of Manyanga non-figural pottery, M. J. Maquet ob- served, in the 1930s, that all female potters had to forego intercourse with men when working on the pots (1938:8). In 1975, I found that potting in Luangu was practiced only by older women who no longer have relations with their hus- bands. Also, the Zande male potters, as recorded by E. E. Evans-Pritchard, abstained from sexual intercourse the night before digging out their clay to prevent the pots from cracking during firing (1937:67). J. Roscoe observed that the Ganda male potters, who were a special social caste and lived with their families apart from the commoners, took rigorous care to prevent women from touching the pots before they were fired (1966:399-402). Kongo and Kwakongo male potters were even more strict, taking much precaution that women be absent during my inquiries and their demonstrations. (My own pre- sence never seems to trouble Kongo male potters, presumably because, as a mundele, I have a different status anyway). P. H. G. Powell-Cotton also described a case among the Lango in the Imatong Mountains in Sudan where, in the villages of male bamun, cameroons / brass, 14" high 06 galerie berman limited/221 west 82 st., nyc by appointment/212 362-0669 63 From our world-wide collections Matrimonial ancestor figure 6^^^k iAshanti, Ghana.

The fact that the oral tradition in Muba emphasizes Voa- nya's seclusion during potting does not thus indicate that his behavior was exceptional but rather proves the lack of experi- ence of the Muba inhabitants with potters. Also, by linking the professional practice with Voanya's personal habits, the tradi- tion suggests his character. He is described as having been very rich but lacking generosity. Selfishness and lack of generosity are perhaps the worst characteristics that Kongo maxims can attribute to a chief. The sign for such a chiefs misconduct is the palm of the hand turned down. Voanya's selfishness was such, the elders declare, that Muba's present chief inherited only the ngonge, an iron double gong, as the chiefs regalia. To my knowledge, Voanya did not produce utilitarian pots. Both the oral tradition and the works preserved testify to this. In this regard, he differed from the Kwakongo potters who have been supplying the Kongo clientele with pots, and whose figural terracottas occupy only a minor part of their activity. Voanya specialized in figural pottery, but he always combined a bowl with one or two standing, sitting, and in rare cases, kneeling human figures; with a human head; or with a rider. The bowl shape creates the pedestal, and the hat or headdress of the human head is usually removable, functioning as a little lid. Both the figures and the bowls are hollow, although the objects would hardly be serviceable as containers. Like all Kwakongo pottery, both non-figural and figural, Voanya's pieces were made by a process of building up the clay. This procedure separates them from the clay figures of central Kongo country made from molds, a slight incidence of which I was able to trace mainly in the graveyards. Voanya's repertoire, as far as it is known, was not too broad, consisting of variations on the above themes. The iconography incorporates numerous European features in dress and hair styles as well as in the equestrian motif. However, it would be erroneous to consider him an imitator of European earthenware or porcelain imported from England, Holland, and Germany. Even considering the iconographic borrowings from Europe, where Voanya is once again congruent with the Kwakongo potters, there is not one case providing evidence of a direct copy or even inspiration from European prototypes.7 Imported earthenware and porcelain, both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, some of which was probably made explicitly for the African market (lions, elephants), were incorporated by the Bakongo as ready-mades.8 They always remained mundele objects, clearly discernible from the objects locally produced. These imports became status symbols because of their price and can be found on the graves of the headmen and also, rarely, in the chief's lumbu, that part of his house where regalia are kept. Only very sporadically were these European importa- tions imitated.9 As I mentioned before, Kwakongo and Kongo potters also produce some figural pottery to this day. Part of this produc- tion reached markets in Boma and Banana, accessible to Europeans, together with their non-figural ware. However, this figural pottery is purchased predominantly by the Bakongo themselves. Anthropomorphic, cephalomorphic and even zoomorphic sculptures in clay are not used by the Bakongo as decorative objects, nor are they status symbols like the imported earthen- ware. They are constituents of the complex Kongo system of non-verbal communication. Every Kwakongo and Kongo figurative terracotta sculpture conveys a distinct message that Ancestor figure Ibo, Nigeria 56" Sclcatu New York City 10012 * (212) 925-0683 New York City 10012 - (212) 92540683 64 I</page><page sequence="7">is understandable to everyone by a set of certain composi- tional, postural, gestural and iconographic features. The fact that the message always refers to Kongo maxims of social behavior would explain why the key to the comprehension of the code is, in principle, commonly available.10 One sculpture may be appropriate to a variety of situations depending on the interpretation of the maxim; however, all these situations have a common denominator to which the maxim applies. The person who is supposed to receive a certain communication can be presented with a terracotta that carries the appropriate memento. For four years I have been exposing Bakongo of various professional, age and social strata to photographs of several of Voanya's potteries. The testing, also conducted in villages close to Muba, results in one unambiguous conclusion: they are not able to read the objects shown in the photographs. Sometimes this conclusion was reached simply because the person or community did not express any reaction. Sometimes the reaction was clearly expressed by the refusal, "That's not ours." In some cases, after hesitating and passing the photo- graphs to each other, they said that the pottery seemed to have been made by a white person. It should be mentioned that the majority of the very same people who refused Voanya's sculptures did not have any difficulty in identifying the figural pottery made in Kwakongo, some of which was also shown in photographs. From these results one can draw a noteworthy observation about the perception of the art object. Not only was Voanya's pottery unknown to the Bawoyo, Bakwakongo, Bandibu or Bamanyanga, but its themes were not understood by them. An eloquent example is Voanya's sculpture of a man and a woman, now in the Museum Rietberg in Zurich, a photograph of which has been used in my tests for several years.1l The theme undoubtedly was one of Voanya's favorites, one variant being, for instance, in the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale in Tervuren,12 and two versions in the Museum of Mankind (British Museum).13 After the piece was rejected as not made by a Mukongo, I asked what the object was. The answer was usually tumba (figural sculpture). In most cases (and in the village context), this response ended the inquiry. A further question on what the sculpture represented would be im- mediately disdained by a gesture informing me that the interviewee did not know, despite the obvious fact that the sculpture depicts a man and a woman. This observation leads me to the conclusion that the people I interviewed do not read an image by its appearance, but rather by its meaning. The image is a mere carrier of the message and not a primary stimulus for its perception and understanding. On other occa- sions, when working with a different type of art, I learned that the notions of theme and subject matter have a different definition for the Kongo. Although presumably not formally trained, Voanya seems to have acquired his knowledge of potting in one of the neighbor- ing traditional Kwakongo centers. In one of them, Lele Sikila, the response of the potters to the pots shown in the photographs suggested familiarity with the formal and technical traits of his sculptures. While they also designated them as not being theirs, they added with no hesitation, "We would be able to make them, if you wished." Despite this rather positive response and the fact that Voanya's professional habits and prohibitions were consistent with custom, his terracottas di- verge from the iconographic, proportional and postural codes of traditional pottery. This is not to imply that the departure from the tradition was esthetically negative. Voanya's clay sculptures are sculpturally 65</page><page sequence="8">more robust than most of the figural sculpture used by the Bakongo that was produced in various Kongo centers that complied with the traditional code. His pottery, free of symbolism attached to certain gestures, seems to be more genre-like, and his figures have the vitality that is so suited to the clay medium. Although Voanya's sculptures do not excel in the canonic precision, they have an impressive volumetric presence, and certain accidental features provide them with directness and sincerity. There are sufficient historical grounds on which to conjec- ture that the absence of an elaborated system of symbols and signs in Voanya's works is not the result of the sculptor's ignorance but rather of his intention. Having been mfumu ma kanda, he not only shared with the community familiarity with the codes, but he undoubtedly had access to the knowledge of the elite. Since Voanya worked for foreign clients, to avoid profaning the traditional symbolic system, he seems to have chosen to elaborate his own visual, non-symbolic vocabulary. Voanya therefore did not make any effort to reach clients of his own culture and concentrated during his entire artistic career on the production of secular objects, which proved to be quite efficient in the cross-cultural visual dialogue to which he committed himself. The absence of symbolic structure seems to ensue from a mind concerned with the incompatibility of the Kongo symbolic value system and the European consumer. Thus Voanya's art offers a negative, yet a most eloquent, piece of evidence for the existence, strength, vitality, and coherence of what Max Dvorak would call Kongo Geist, a term that includes religion and philosophy as well as art. Its consistency is such that an effort at compromise would result in a pseudomorph, and Voanya's sculpture is not pseudomorphic. It is an art that remained morphologically and technically African, even though it responded to the presence of Euro- peans in the country, a historical fact for four centuries. The response is not manifested merely in European elements in dress or hairdo but mainly intervenes with the substance of Kongo art, with its semantic stratum. All terracottas that remained in Voanya's house at his death were buried with him. With utmost deference and dignity, his nephew Dumu Dioko pays respect to his uncle by offering a libation and prayers at his grave in a nearby forest. The late chief of Muba, remembered with all his human weaknesses, receives high esteer. as an ancestor. O Bibliography, page 92 All-Ngwa Cultural Festival Continued from page 37 join the high priest in paying respect to Ngwa ancestors as well as to sacrifice to ancestral gods. During the Mkpe, which can be interpreted as ritual confession, these traditional religious leaders ask for favors for all Ngwa people who are lovers of their fellow men. They also wish death to all those who harbor evil intentions that could cause the death of innocent people and to the enemies of Ngwa progress and prosperity. The last Mkpe I attended was in June 1972. At the time of this particular ceremony there was division in Ngwa leadership, which caused some leaders to refuse to come to Okpuala-Ngwa. In his prayer, Chief Ama wished death to those who did not recognize the cultural centrality of the town. As a mark of solidarity toward the festival, the religious leaders put their ofo (symbol of justice and priestly authority) in one heap and joined hands to lift the sacrificial cock. They asked that their educated sons would gain rapid promotions in the civil service, and that those who envied their progress would die. 66 KARL-FERDINAND SCHADLER AFRICAN ART IN PRIVATE GERMAN COLLECTIONS A new book on hitherto unpublished treasures of African art. 370 pages, over 500 illustrations, 30 color plates.

The Canada Council and Sam Sarick Limited provided the necessary funds for the research of Kongo art. I also thank l'Institut de Re- cherche Scientifique du Zaire for their efficient cooperation with my studies in the field. 1. I thank Miss Huguette Van Geluwe, Chef de travaux a la Section d'Ethnographie, Muste Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, for this infor- mation. 2. Migration and fluctuation of various Kongo art objects within the area of the old Kongo kingdom were studied in Specific Aspects of the History of Kongo Art (Volavka 1973). 3. I am obliged with my thanks to Mr. Dumu Dioko and other elders of Muba for their patient attention to my inquiries and for their abundant information. I also thank Mr. Dioko for the ceremony of libation in the forest of the Muba graveyard (nziami) and mainly on the grave of Voanya, at which I was able to be present. 4. See Volavka (1973) on fluctuation of art objects infra limes of the old Kongo kingdom. 5. See note 1. 6. The gourds are in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto (HA 2561, HA 2562). 7. See, for instance, clay figures in the Musee Royal de 1'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren (Annales du Musee du Congo, Ethnographie et anthropologie, Serie III. Notes analytiques sur les collections ethnographiques du Musee du Congo. T. II. Les industries indi- genes. Fasc. I. La Ciramique, Bruxelles, s.a., Pl. IV, nos. 55, 56, 57). 8. Institut des Musees Nationaux du Zaire (Kinshasa) has an exten- sive collection of these European importations collected by the museum staff and suppliers in the Kongo graveyards. 9. See some contemporary works of the potter Mayivangwa of Mbanza Manteke (MacGaffey 1975:25-31, 92). The Muste Royal de l'Afrique Centrale has in its collections a very awkward imitation of a Toby jug. It arrived at the museum in 1917 (no. RG 19959). 10. It is true that the ability to read these messages is now decreasing in some communities proportionally to various moder social factors such as the urban affiliations of the younger generation or the flux of the population because of political reasons since the late 1950s. 11. Museum Rietberg, Zurich, no. RAC 754. The piece was pub- lished by Elsy Leuzinger (1963:190-91) as a pottery from Kwakongo. I thank the Museum Rietberg for providing me with the photograph. 12. Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, nos. RG 20241, RG 5112.2. I thank H. Van Geluwe for providing me with the photo- graphs. 13.
