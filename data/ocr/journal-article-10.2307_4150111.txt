Mainz am Rhein: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 2002. XI + 206 pp., 56 figures, 102 black- and-white plates, 8 color plates. Cloth. 4128.00. This is the long-awaited second volume of small finds from Norguntepe, appearing six years after Norquntepe, Kleinfunde I: Die Lithische Industrie, which was pub- lished by the same author in 1996. Reading through this most comprehensive final report on small finds, one can better understand the delay in its publication and appreci- ate the results of the time-consuming multidisciplinary</page><page sequence="2">2004 BOOK REVIEWS 79 and comparative research carried out by Klaus Schmidt and others. The small finds presented in this volume were re- covered during the seven seasons of excavations (1968- 1974) at Norguntepe carried out under the direction of Harald Hauptmann, on behalf of the German Institute of Archaeology in Istanbul and within the framework of the Keban Project rescue excavations. Some of the stone, bone, horn, clay, metal, and glass objects from this site briefly appeared in the preliminary reports of the Keban Project Publications published by the Middle East Techni- cal University. Norguntepe understandably retains its prominent place as one of the thoroughly excavated and best-recorded major multiperiod sites in the Elazig province of eastern Anatolia. Its occupational history, which culminated in 40 architectural levels, started with the Late Chalcolithic pe- riod (Levels 40-31) and was followed by Early Bronze Age (Levels 30-6), Middle Bronze Age (Levels 5-4), Late Bronze Age (Level 3), and Iron Age (Levels 2-1) occupations. This volume consists of chapters A-D and a five-part appendix. Chapter A provides a detailed and compara- tive description of weapons and tools recovered from all the occupational levels of Norguntepe, including from the surface of the mound. This chapter is divided into six sections in accordance with the material used in the pro- duction of weapons and tools from the Late Chalcolithic period to the Iron Age: I: Ground Stone; II: Bone and Horns/Antler; III: Clay; IV: Copper and Bronze; V: Iron; and VI Lead and Wood. The weapons and tools made of ground stone range from simple choppers/cleavers mainly from the Late Chalcolithic levels, to flat hammers and adzes; and from shaft-hole battle and tool axes, shaft-hole hammers, mace heads, and whetstones to numerous other tools and receptacles including bowls, pestles, grinding stones and slabs, and perforated weights. Generally speak- ing, the range of weapons and tools, including many of the miscellaneous stone articles, are not unique to this site but are found in many of the neighboring and more distant sites as well. What is unique, however, is the detailed way that these have been published in this volume. In Chapter B the author describes the ornamental ob- jects in sections, according to a material classification, and each section is treated in considerable detail. These sec- tions consist of I: Stone; II: Bone, Horn/Antler and Shell; III: Copper and Bronze; IV: Precious Metals, Lead and Iron; V: Glass and Fritte. In each section the ornamental objects are subdivided according to their basic forms. In Section I, the Ground Stone category of ornaments, the subdivision based on forms is restricted to various decora- tive attachments, namely, beads, rings, and diverse. In the Bone, Horn/Antler and Shell category of decorative ob- jects, the forms are naturally more varied and include an impressive selection of decorated and undecorated pins probably used to fasten clothes. It is obvious that from the typological point of view, the chronological value of such pins is no less important than their metal counterparts in establishing the time span of their diffusion within Anato- lia and beyond in the third millennium B.C. This is espe- cially so in view of the fact that a good proportion of these derived from Level 8 (EBA IIIB), while the remainder was recovered from earlier and later EBA levels, and from Level 0. Chapter C deals with Figurative Objects that include human-shaped figurines, animal figurines, and zoomorphic vessels. The author classified them according to forms rather than materials used in their production. The human- shaped figurines include stone, bone, clay, and frit made into simple flat idols, stylized anthropomorphic figurines, and the game stone type figurines. The zoomorphic vessels show a wide variety of species and body forms, from trough-shaped bodies (nos. 1283, 1285-1286) to bull-shaped, ram-shaped, and dove-shaped rhytons, and other types of animal-shaped vessels, includ- ing one with a duck head (no. 1282), of the so-called Tepecik type (p. 103, Abb. 40). Together with a rich selec- tion of animals figurines recovered mainly from the EBA levels, and from Level 0, these represent an important por- tion of the food and draft animals in the local fauna of Norguntepe. Chapter D presents the glyptic material recovered from all levels of Norguntepe in three groups: "bread seals," stamp seals, and cylinder seals. At this site, "bread seals" appear to have been produced in the second half of the third millennium and continued to be used in the early second millennium B.C. Of a total of 16 seals, some with a second smaller stamp on the handle (nos. 1314, 1316, 1317), half were found in Level 0. These seals, apparently used to mark the soft surfaces of bread or cakes prior to baking, have a wide geographical distribution extending from Transcaucasia in the east to the Balkans in the west. In Anatolia the densest concentration seems to be in the Upper Euphrates valley. One must find it significant that their appearance in Norguntepe coincides with the gradual transformation of the settlement into an administrative and commercial center. In other words, such seals should per- haps be considered another of the material culture signs pointing to the centralization of production, consumption, and redistribution. The author divided the stamp seals and the few seal impressions into eight groups according to their forms. Of these the first four groups-bow-shaped, round, rectangu- lar and bead-shaped seals (nos. 1318-1337)-were recov- ered from the Late Chalcolithic levels of the settlement. Stylistic comparisons with some of the key sites in the Euphrates basin (e.g., Degirmentepe) and Upper Tigris (e.g., Tepe Gawra) where Ubaid-type seals and sealings have been found in large quantities suggest that most of the material could be dated to the fourth phase of this culture, although indications are that this cultural horizon infil- trated this region slightly earlier. Of the remaining four</page><page sequence="3">80 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 334 groups-stamp seals with handles, and button-shaped, cone- shaped, and bell-shaped stamp seals-the most significant two are the button-shaped biconvex seals and seal impres- sions (nos. 1340-1344). Although only one of them came from Level 3, and the rest from the topsoil Level 0, on the strength of their hieroglyphic inscriptions they all seem to belong to the late phase of the Late Bronze Age. This glyp- tic material helps us realize that while Korucutepe may have been the political center or one of the major centers of the kingdom of Isuwa, Norguntepe was by no means an insignificant town in this kingdom. The cone-shaped and bell-shaped seal groups come from the Second Iron Age Level (1) and from Level 0. Some of these are reminiscent of the Urartian-type seals farther east. Among the cylinder seals, the earliest group is re- presented by the Jemdet Nasr style (nos. 1354-1356) of the early third millennium B.C. The second group consists of three seals of Mitanni or Kerkuk style recovered from Level 3 (Late Bronze Age) and contemporary with those from Korucutepe and Tepecik. Finally, the third group consists of varia. With the exception of specimen no. 1353, which was found in Level 3 but was probably a clay imitation of an EBA I seal, the rest, which includes three seal impressions, derives from Level 0. Among this group no. 1358 may have originally derived from an LBA II context. A seemingly Cypriot origin makes its presence at Norguntepe interesting. In terms of Isuwa's political, cul- tural, and trade interactions, it may point not only toward the great Hittite centers of central Anatolia but toward north Syria as well. The appendix of this book contains important infor- mation on metalwork, archaeometallurgical analysis of slag remains, and burials. E. Pernicka, K. Schmidt, and S. Schmidt-Strecker's presentation of the metalwork in nine parts is quite comprehensive. Quantitative, typologi- cal, and comparative details are well emphasized, and the reader is presented with the interesting results of neutron activation and lead isotope analyses. The earliest finds are from the Late Chalcolithic levels. The EBA IB/IIA finds are treated together; after all, they represent the early part of the third millennium B.C. These two subsections are fol- lowed by a very brief reference to arsenical bronzes. The following subsections 4 and 5 deal with EBA IIB/IIIA metallurgy and subsections 6 and 7 with tin bronze and lead metallurgy. Finally, subsections 8 and 9 very briefly touch on the metallurgy of the Middle Bronze Age-Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. The second part of the appen- dix, the archaeometallurgical analyses of the slag remains by Istvin Baranyi, complements the first part. Summing up, it may be said that Norguntepe's metal finds and indus- trial residue contribute significantly to the history of the metal industry in the Upper Euphrates region. Fragments of ceramic ladles for pouring molten metal, crucibles, and fire pits or furnaces used for smelting and melting, as well as small quantities of slag in Levels 36-35, point to the existence of metal workshops already in the Late Chalco- lithic settlement. The ore samples recovered from the Late Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age levels of Norguntepe ap- parently derived from oxidized polymetallic deposits. The most common group of mineral used by the fourth-millen- nium smiths and smelted by a multistep operation con- tained a high percentage of arsenic and antimony, and it may have been used as a raw material for an alloying reaction with copper. The presence of crucible and ladle fragments in the EBA IB levels (starting with Level 26), including similar finds and copper slag residue in refuse pits (under Level 23), indicates that metal workshops con- tinued their activities unabated. Continued production of metal objects did not decrease the quantitative edge of the stone, flint, obsidian, and bone assemblages of tools and weapons such as points, long triangular arrowheads, harpoons, pins, and awls. Strangely enough, such assem- blages became richer from Level 23 onward when the gradual arrival of Transcaucasian groups is reflected in the ceramic assemblage and wooden-house architecture. Smelting/melting installations in a Level 21 house (Abb. 47) and melting pots, ladles, and copper slag residue in the nearby houses and street are among the clear indications for the intensification of metal production at this time. The continued existence of a local metal industry in this settle- ment is corroborated in a single-room workshop in Level 19 (Abb. 49) that produced metal tools and weapons cast in molds (e.g., axes). The third part of the appendix presents the data on various forms of burials including the rich variety of mor- tuary finds throughout the occupation history at Nor- ?untepe, starting with the Medieval-period cemetery on the Acropolis (Abb. 55). This is followed by Middle Iron Age burials (Abb. 55). The third group covers the pithos burials and inhumations of the Iron Age found in the vi- cinity of the settlement. The fourth group consists mainly of Late Chalcolithic and EBA IB/IIA pithos graves and in- humations found in the occupation layers of 23, 26, and 33-35. In my opinion the most interesting grave found in the cemetery on the Acropolis is that of a horse (Abb. 55). The likely date and provenance of this Scythian-type burial is discussed at some length with reference to other examples in the Caucasus and northeast Iraq (pp. 150-51). The sixth group of burials is presented under the headings "Square Chamber" and the "Large Group" (Abb. 55, pp. 151-53). The finds in the "Square Chamber" tomb, which include a bronze tweezers (no. 673) of the type seen in the Hallstattkultur of Central Europe, suggest a date in the Iron Age. The fourth part of the appendix consists of an inventory of characteristic finds from periods represented at this site. Finally, the fifth part of the appendix lists and cate- gorizes the raw materials used in the manufacture of all the small objects found at Norguntepe. The second list provides the types of tools, weapons, ornaments, and group of artifacts with their corresponding correlations and references. The cultural significance of the geographical distri- bution of various categories and types of small finds in</page><page sequence="4">2004 BOOK REVIEWS 81 the Upper Euphrates valley naturally needs to be evaluated within reliable chronological frameworks that exist for eastern Anatolia and Transcaucasia. Radiocarbon estimates from Norguntepe, combined with those from Arslantepe- Malatya, continue to provide important guidelines espe- cially for the EBA chronology of east Anatolia. However, regarding the advisability of total reliance on all C-14 measurements from Norguntepe, some caution is advis- able. This prudence is not out of place in view of striking discrepancies with relative dates derived through its mate- rial culture correlations with neighboring sites. For in- stance, while a few radiocarbon readings from the Early Bronze Age levels of Norguntepe suggest that this period may have started ca. 3300 B.C., material culture correla- tions with Arslantepe VIB 1 and Hassek H6ytik forced the excavators to place the beginning of this period no earlier than ca. 3000 B.C. (Hauptmann 2000: 421-22; Abb. 1, 2). When a rather similar problem was encountered with the dating of the EBA II levels, it was decided not to take the four C-14 dates that overlapped with the interval of 2881- 2614 B.C. (Di Nocera 2000: 75-76, 83, fig. 5a) at their face value. Instead, this phase of the Early Bronze Age was placed within the time frame of 2700-2500 B.C. (Haupt- mann 2000: 422-23, Abb. 2). As for the five C-14 read- ings from the EBA IIIA levels, these cover the interval 2458-2324 B.C. and therefore their reliability is not doubted. The same level of confidence is applied to the 15 of 17 readings that derive from the EBA IIIB strata. The well-stratified material culture records of Nor- guntepe indicate that in the second half of the third millen- nium B.C. this settlement was likely one of the important economic and political centers in the Upper Euphrates region. Culturally, this period is characterized by a re- newal of intensive interaction with the urban centers in the Lower Euphrates basin of Turkey. In studying the socio- economic and cultural significance of various tool assem- blages within the small finds, one gets the impression that by Level 13 Norguntepe was no longer a simple rural settlement but rather on the way to becoming a town-like settlement. In fact, by Levels 8-7 an imposing architec- tural complex consisting of various industrial, storage, and production units occupied the central area (the so-called Acropolis) of the settlement. This can be taken as the re- flection of the emergence or consolidation of a central economy, as is often the case with state-level societies. As for the political status of this site in the early second mil- lennium B.C., this is difficult to define. In this case the small finds, or for that matter the architectural and other remains, are not of much help. Nevertheless, it is impor- tant to point out that during the Middle Bronze Age some settlements in the Elazig province, especially those that participated in the organized trade activities between the Assyrian trade colonies in Anatolia and in major political and economic centers in northern Syria and Mesopotamia, succeeded in developing into important urban agglomera- tions (e.g., Korucutepe). In the Late Bronze Age increased Hittite political and cultural influence is reflected by the more conspicuous presence of central Anatolian cultural characteristics in this Isuwan town. This is seen not only in the pottery corpus of Level 3, but in the assemblages of small finds as well. After the destruction of the Late Bronze Age Isuwan town, this settlement was quickly resettled in the Early Iron Age (Level 2). The new settlement was of rural char- acter with no monumental buildings to speak of. Here, too, when examining the historical and cultural context of the material culture evidence, one should take into considera- tion that between Levels 2 and 3 there could have been only a brief interruption. This stratigraphic observation is further confirmed by the presence of central Anatolian- type LBA II pottery together with handmade, dark-colored corrugated ceramics in the houses of Level 2 on the south- ern terrace (Bartl 1995: 209). Norquntepe continued to be occupied for an unspecific duration following Level 2. In the assemblages from Levels 1 and 0, signs of contact with Urartu are reflected in the typology of some of the small finds. Finally, the author has to be warmly congratulated not only for producing a book of this magnitude, but also for presenting the material in a way that makes it appealing to read and relatively easy for the reader to cope with. Need- less to say, this volume is an important addition to the ever-growing list of literature on Anatolian archaeology.
