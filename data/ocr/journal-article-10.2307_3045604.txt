<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELEMENTS OF BUDDHIST ICONOGRAPHY. By Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. 95 Pp.; 15 Pis.; 4to. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1935. $ 3.50. Dr. Coomaraswamy's three recent books, A New Approach to the Vedas, The Transformation of Nature in Art, and Elements of Buddhist Iconography, constitute, I believe, the most significant contribution yet made in a Western language toward a true understanding of Oriental thought and art. The first named takes back even to the Rg-Veda the essential basis of Indian thought which underlies all the later developments of philosophy, literature, drama and art. The second clearly states from sources mainly Indian and partially Chinese a theory valid for all phases of Asiatic art. Moreover, in one chapter devoted to Eckhart's theory of art, Dr. Coomaraswamy shows that mediaeval European art was based on these same principles and thus indicates an indirect route toward the comprehension of the art of the East. In the Elements of Buddhist Iconography, our author explains clearly the literal, allegorical, and anagogic meaning of certain fundamental aniconic symbols, the Tree of Life, the Earth Lotus, the Word Wheel, the Lotus Throne, and the Fiery Pillar, which he shows go back into the mists of time, although, so far as we know, they were first used in works of art by the Buddhists. They have continued in use by the Buddhists of various countries and have been used also by Hindus, side by side with the anthropomorphic images which developed in connect- ion with the bhakti-v-da, or devotional theism pre- dominant in mediaeval India. A New Approach to the Vedas has but little bearing upon art and that little is also covered in the two other books. The Transformation of Nature in Art (reviewed by Thomas Munro in The Art Bulletin, XVI (1934), PP. 397-8) gives the reader a very clear idea of the purpose and use of images, aniconic, theriomorphic, and anthropomorphic, as well as of the Indian theory of aesthetics. We learn that the image maker goes through a process of yoga, or concentration, which is of the order of personal devotion, with the aim of having an immediate experience of identification with the ideally determined form of the divinity or other being he is about to make. He visualizes the image in the" immanent space in the heart." These art forms are ideally determined by racial consciousness and represent to our mentality the operative principles by which we explain phenomena. For example, the concept of universal life or cosmic activity as the Dance of Siva may be compared to the scientific explanation of a perceptible straight line as the shortest distance between two points. Art is by definition conventional and does not compete with nature but relies on its own criteria</page><page sequence="2">514 THE ART BULLETIN imitating nature not in appearance, but in operation (quoted from St. Thomas by Dr. Coomaraswamy.in explanation of the Indian theory and practice). All art tends toward perfection, where the pictorial and formal elements are one. The anthropomorphic image is essentially the same as the aniconic symbol and is not intended to function biologically or to deceive the eye. It is to the worshipper what diagrams are to the geometrician (a statement quoted by Dr. Coomar- aswamy from Rao, the author of Elements of Hindu Iconography). Thus, the icon is a visual symbol, ideal in the mathematical sense and not a deceptive replica of any objective cause of sensation. The whole is a unity the relation of whose parts is mental rather than functional. The image represents, not a moment of time, but a continuous condition, for instance, the Enlightenment of the Buddha, the Dance of Siva, the play of Krsna with the milkmaids, realizable in the heart and mind of man. Art is defined as expression informed by ideal beauty. Art is by nature a wellspring of delight. " Pure aesthetic experience is theirs in whom the knowledge of ideal beauty is innate; it is known intuitively, in intellectual ecstasy without accom- paniment of ideation, at the highest level of conscious being; born of one mother with the vision of God, its life is as it were a flash of blinding light of trans- mundane origin, impossible to analyze, and yet in the image of our very being." In spite of this definition of aesthetic experience, translated by Dr. Coomaraswamy from the Siihitya darpana, we are warned that the experience arises in relation to a specific representation, and that we must possess an a priori knowledge of the matter, the subject, before we are competent to criticize, a process which repeats that of creation. Styles are idioms of know- ledge and communication which are understood as our native language is understood, but which, when they are foreign to us, must be learned "with industry and patience," "just as one learns to write." In the Elements of Buddhist Iconography, Dr. Coomaraswamy cites passages from the Upanisads and other works, both pre-Buddhist and Buddhist, which explain the metaphysical significance of the Tree of Life-in Buddhism, the Bodhi Tree-and of other symbols, showing that Buddhist symbolism is proper to the one great tradition which has persisted from the Vedic or a pre-Vedic period until now. The tree is the supreme fiery energy which awakens, springs up, and expands. The waters from which the lotus rises are the " possibilities of existence, " and the lotus itself denotes ontologically a firm establish- ment amongst these possibilities, a birth or manifest- ation primarily in the intelligible, or also and conse- quently in the sensible, world. The Buddha rests on a lotus because Enlightenment is possible only in a phenomenal world. The wheel is regarded from two points of view, as principial (Dharmacakra) or as phenomenal (Sains-~racakra), hence from the stand- point of the Wayfarer is either to be turned or stayed, but from that of the Comprehensor is one and the same uninterrupted form, his own intrinsic form. The Buddha is at once the Sovereign Mover of the Wheel and the Wheel itself, the Word as set in motion. The Buddha seat is at the navel of the world wheel, the center of the universe, and this seat is no determinable spot, but a psychological center and point of consciousness where "every where and every when is focussed." This is not to say that there was no historical Buddha, just as the conception of Christ as Logos does not preclude the historicity of Jesus. Indeed, "by whatever name, personal or essential, the Spoken Word, the Wheel in Revolution, the Tree of Life, or Fiery Pillar, he may be called, in whatever forms he may be imagined, who surely takes the forms imagined by his wor- shippers," he, Buddha or BrahmN or Christ or Muham- mad, " is one and the same, his throne is single." In these books, Dr. Coomaraswamy shows an understanding not only of Indian but also of Chinese and Japanese, not to speak of mediaeval Christian, thought and art which is profound. Take, for example, his discussion of the Six Canons of Hsieh Ho, Transformation....., pp. 19-21, and especially his treatment of Ch'an (Zen), ibid., pp. 39-44. To his work in these three books, I have only one slight emendation to make. The divinity illustrated in Elements of Buddhist Iconography, pl. XV, described as Padmapdni--the Lotus-holder, one of Avalo- kitesvara's many names-may be more specifically designated as Cint-mani-cakra Avalokitesvara. The importance of the three books by Dr. Coomar- aswamy can hardly be overestimated, for, not only do they throw into clear relief the essential signifi- cance of all phases of the art of the Orient, but they are a call to the West to cease its preoccupation with surfaces and return to reality, albeit by the path primarily of its own scientific concepts which art and religion must come to embody, thus achieving an understanding not only of the art of the East but also of itself. I may add only that I fully believe that forces in this direction are already at work. HELEN B. CHAPIN</page></plain_text>
