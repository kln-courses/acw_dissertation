<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE  ETHICS DERRIDA, ALICE, AND ANIMALS JEROME BUMP In view of recent research can we continue to argue for a superiority  over other animals that justifies dominating and exploiting them? This  question, now “in the center of ethical discussion,” invites us to “radi- cally reconsider the terms of ethical inquiry” (Rolston 1993, 382). Those  terms now include the feelings biophilia and biophobia as well as com- passion, sympathy, and empathy. Are we prepared to value not only rea- son but also emotions that connect us to other animals? If we are to  save ourselves and our planet, we need a more interdisciplinary model of  ethics that includes “emotive” as well as analytic ethics. Derrida’s “L’An- imal que donc je suis (ti suivre)” (1997) combines them, citing literature  to demonstrate the role of feelings in situation-specific ethics. Though  he does not use E.O Wilson’s terminology, Derrida suggests that what  blocks biophilia is an apparently instinctive, superstitious fear of animals  that has expanded into what we now call biophobia. Ultimately, Derrida  focuses on a new experience of compassion that can bring about the  political change needed to save our planet. Exclusively analytical environmental ethics is being challenged by  posthumanist, Continental, and feminist philosophy (Aaltola 2010; Plum- wood 2002, Grosz 1993, Haraway 2007), but the biggest possible change  may be a move toward a truly interdisciplinary model like that of animal  studies.1 There the biological sciences are setting the pace.

Orr 1993, 430–31). Will we replace “our human  reproductive instincts” with “biophilia and concern for environmental in- tegrity” (Rolston 1993, 412)? To do that we will have to overcome our  biophobia, which originated in our apparently instinctive, “superstitious  fear of animals” (Oxford English Dictionary 1992) and has now ex- panded into an “active scorn for whatever is not man-made, managed,  or air-conditioned” (Orr 1993, 416) that threatens ecosystemic and land  ethics as well as animal ethics. The “emotional spectra” of this biophil- ia-biophobia conflict ranges “from attraction to aversion, from awe to  indifference, from peacefulness to fear-driven anxiety” (Wilson 1993, 31).  Is analytic ethics, as we know it, prepared to discuss such feelings?  The answer, in current Anglo-American moral philosophy, is usually “No.”  Even Singer and Regan convey their “masculinst contempt” for emotions  such as “love and friendship that are appropriate and necessary to animal  ethics” (Slicer 2007, 113–14; cf. McCance 2013, 94). Yet if we are to save  ourselves and our planet, we need a more interdisciplinary model that in- cludes “emotive”4 as well as analytic ethics, one more aligned with eight- eenth-century British moral philosophers of the sympathetic imagination  such as David Hume (Treatise on Human Nature 1738) and Adam Smith  (Theory of Moral Sentiments 1789), with Darwin’s theory of the emo- tional origin of ethics (The Descent of Man 1871), and also with modern  philosophers of “quasicognitive,” “enlightened” sympathy such as John  Fisher 1987 who argued that “almost any moral theory will have to find  some place for our moral feelings, connected as they are to our moral  intuitions” (204, 206, 198n2). More important than any theory perhaps,  as Ulrich has observed, are “the public’s emotion-laden attitudes toward  different natural environments [that] play a role in motivating political  58 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="3"> and other support”—hence we must understand and promulgate “posi- tive emotion-saturated attitudes with respect to the environment” (1993,  117–18; cf. Heerwagen and Orians 1993, 164). Fortunately, because of the growing academic research on feelings  and the increasing recognition that “emotional intelligence” is essential  to many fields, it is now more intellectually acceptable to admit the need  for thought and emotion to be in harmony (Damasio 1996; Gruen 1991,  351). This research, summarized by Goleman (1995), subsumes Howard  Gardner’s earlier theory of multiple intelligences, including the interper- sonal, intrapsychic, spatial, kinesthetic, and musical. In 2002 Zembylas  cited new research on emotion “in virtually all of the disciplines, with phi- losophy, sociology, psychology, history, and anthropology taking the lead”  (187). Scott McLemee’s 2003 cover story in The Chronicle of Higher Edu- cation, “Getting Emotional,” showed how the “study of feelings...is now  spreading to...literature, and other fields...producing a body of work that  regularly crosses the line between the humanities and the social sciences”  (McLemee 2002, 1).  A Sand County Almanac (Leopold 1949; cf. Meine 2002; McCance  2013, 35) reminds us that the “philia” in biophilia is a feeling often com- municated best by literature. E. O. Wilson, another great science writer,  defines us as “the poetic species,” stressing that “the symbols of art, music,  and language freight power beyond their outward and literal meanings”  (1984, 74, 62–64; cf. Rohman 2009). Hence literature can become a cal- isthenics of that “sympathetic imagination” that is the basis of ethical  behavior, according to many eighteenth-century British philosophers of  ethics. They valued literature’s capacity to transcend “the barrier between  us and another living being and, by actually entering into the other, so to  speak, to secure a momentary but complete identification with the other  being” (Bate 1945, 144).  Derrida conceded that this experience can seem arational, paradox- ical, even paralinguistic: a syncopated beat of “continuity and interrup- tion,” an “extreme paradox” at the limit of “distance and contact,” a  “sharing out without fusion,” a “being-with without confusion” (Derrida  2000, 199, 195). No matter how brief or incomplete the identification, the  effort to connect is the crucial ethical exercise. Nobel-Prize winner Coet- zee showed how literature helps us “imagine our way into that way of  moving [of an animal], to inhabit that body” (2003, 95–96). The “becom- ing animal” philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari (1987) inspired Meloy’s  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 59 </page> <page sequence="4"> (2005) and Chisholm’s (2010) entrance “into the other’s bodily orbit,”  synchronizing with the other’s biorhythms “through the conduit of af- fective proximity” (Chisholm, 361–62). Haraway calls this “otherworld- ing”—glimpses into what the Other is “doing, feeling, thinking” (2007,  21). Rokotnitz 2007 defined this emotional intelligence as but one aspect  of what might be called the knowledge of the body, “a primal form of  understanding” (283). This emotional knowledge has generated many abstractions. Weil in- cludes Agamben’s “Shabbat of both animal and man” (2002); Acampo- ra’s “transpecific conviviality” (1999) and Heidigger’s “attunement”—if it  could be extended to other species (Weil 2012 xviii, 69, xvi, 34). However,  Bennett’s “critical empathy” (2005),” Shapiro’s “kinesthetic empathy”  (1990) and Gruen’s “engaged empathy” (2009) are moving to the fore  now because new research in biology on mirror neurons and cognitive  ethology proves that our actions, our perceptions of others, and our emo- tions are intimately linked with the those of other animals (Weil 2012,  19–20, 69, 164n). Of course “love,” as vague a term as it is English, is  still a popular term for one set of emotions. For some, the simplest envi- ronmental ethic would be to extend Augustine’s “love and do what you  will”5 to all species and to the planet itself. Donovan specifies “attentive  love” (2011, 291–94; cf. Warkentin 2010). Weil cites the “real love” both  for and from pets explored by Thomas Mann and Virginia Wolf, and the  “true love—love worthy of its name” between man and dog in Coetzee’s  Disgrace (Weil 2012, xxi, xviii).  Derrida’s translators use the traditional term “compassion.”6 His  “L’Animal que donc je suis (ti suivre)” (1997),7 integrating ethics, litera- ture, and religious studies, is famous for its comparison of industrialized  livestock production to the Holocaust.8 However, we fail to notice how  his compassion for animals supports emotive ethics in general and the  feminist ethic of care in particular.9 We also often fail to recognize the  role of literature in his essay. Though he is himself a philosopher, at times  he assigns as much value to the heart as to the head, to imagination as to  reason, to poetry as to philosophy. Most of Derrida’s readers have focused  on his abstract reasoning, overlooking his belief that “thinking concerning  the animal, if there is such a thing, derives from poetry” (Derrida 2002,  377). For Derrida a poem is “that very thing that teaches the heart, invents  the heart, that which, finally, the word heart seems to mean” (1988, 223,  231).10 60 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="5"> Ultimately if, while reading Derrida’s philosophy and his literary al- lusions, we pay attention to our memories of childhood emotional ex- periences and our current personal feelings, our family-sized “emotional  fields” (Kerr 1988),11 and our larger, collective, sometimes political “struc- tures of feelings” (Williams 1961, 74; cf. Zembylas 2002, Matthews 2001,  Cvetkovich 2010, 2012), we may begin to define “attentive love” (Dono- van 2011, 291–94), the kind of biophilia that some say is the ultimate  goal of all ethics. Most of the time, however, we will become more fully  conscious of the biophobia that blocks this feeling and drives our need for  domination and what may be a uniquely human form of sadism.12 Hence,  though it is less familiar word, what we may need most at this time is an  awareness of how deep and extensive biophobia is, and to what extent it  is instinctive and to what extent it is a product of language, literature, and  culture.  EMOTIVE ETHICS AND LITERATURE In his essay Derrida cites Rilke’s “Schwarze Katze” and “Der Panther”  but his most extensive literary allusions are not to lyrics but to Lewis  Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking Glass  (1872). Indeed, he said, “although time prevents it, I would of course have  liked to inscribe my whole talk within a reading of Lewis Carroll” (Der- rida 2002, 376–77). Why? Admittedly, we will never know for sure, but  Carroll’s preface leads us to expect a “friendly chat with bird and beast”  (7).13 This is an important ethical goal because, as Kant put it, “we can  judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals” (1775–81, 241).14  Secondly, the Alice books illustrate very well the biophobia that sabotages  that goal. Third, Derrida was probably aware that his own high level of  abstraction needed exemplification (Grosz 1997), and the Alice books  provide a narrative context that calls for situation-specific ethics, instanti- ating biophilia and biophobia as only narratives can.15 Fourth, written by  an Oxford lecturer on logic, they have been popular with a variety of phi- losophers.16 Fifth, the Alice books revolve around the basic posthumanist  questions, “Who Are You?” and “What Are You?” Sixth, they exemplify  Derrida’s belief that poetry “precedes cognition,” is “beyond languages,  even if it sometimes happens that it recalls itself in language” (1991, 227).  For him poetry is the “learned unconscious of Verdichtung”17 (1991, 225)  and Alice in Wonderland, of course, is represented as a dream. Seventh,  the Alice books were addressed to a child who had emotional, experien- JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 61 </page> <page sequence="6"> tial knowledge but was unaware of most symbolic meanings of animals  and thus illustrate the challenge of teaching the need for biophilia and  the danger of biophobia to future generations.18 Eighth, as famous exam- ples of popular culture, 19 they reach a more global audience than poetry  or academic philosophy. Ninth, because they invoke canonical Western  texts such as the Bible, they also invite cultural criticism. Finally, the Alice  books in their own right can advance our understanding of the tensions in  ethics between biophilia and biophobia, compassion and fear, the group  and the individual, and the power and limits of language and reason.  Unfortunately, as Derrida’s definition of poetry implies, an academic  essay such as this cannot fully convey the Alice books’ appeal to “the  whole self “(Moustakas 1969; Brand 1980 and 1989). Their illustrations  and their invitations to performance obviously invite an interdisciplinary  approach to “reading.” As Alice puts it, “what is the use of a book without  pictures or conversations?’ ” (11). Carroll’s book originated in a dreamy,  highly imaginative “conversation” performed for an audience as a boat  drifted down the Thames. In his time “poetry was originally meant for  either singing or reciting...till it is spoken, it is not performed, it does not  perform, it is not itself” (Hopkins [1885] 1980, 137). The most we can do  here is point out a few stories in the Alice books that instantiate Derrida’s  arguments, invite the reader to perform them, and explore some reader-re- sponse emotions. ETHICS AND LANGUAGE We may start, as Derrida did, with Adam’s response to the other an- imals in Genesis (Derrida 2002, 369), a source of many primary Western  structures of feeling. The key questions are both “do we have something in  common with other animals?” and “can we open ourselves to, and value,  their radically different modes of being?” In this regard, Adam’s naming  the animals epitomizes what Derrida calls “carnophallogocentrism,” the  domination of the carnivorous, male human over other animals, often  by “the symbolic and real mouth,” especially its “ ‘eat-speak-interiorize’  way of relating to the other,” that is, eating the Other’s “difference” be- fore, finally, consuming its corpse (Derrida 1991, 114; cf. McCance 2013,  148-9.) According to Derrida, Adam’s naming symbolizes “the historical  exclusion of animals because they lack words,” but this should remind “us  that ethics itself is caught up in language, and therefore cannot lay claim  to the kind of self-presence or mastery that it often denies to living oth- 62 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="7"> ers” (Derrida 2008, 23, 41; cf. McCance, 66–67). Hence uses of language  that appeal to the whole self and ultimately point beyond language itself  become essential. Take, for instance, Carroll’s stories of the Gnat and the Fawn (Look- ing Glass, Ch. 3). The power of names is often conceptualized, but is  more easily felt as the Gnat suggests to Alice the freedom of being name- less: when “the governess wanted to call you to your lessons,...she would  have to leave off,...and of course you wouldn’t have to go’ ” (175). A  reader may wonder: if I could free myself momentarily from the net of  language, would I feel as free as a child who need not obey the dictates of  civilization and its irrational fears? Later, when Alice enters the Wood of  No Names, we encounter Derrida’s scene of unknowing: a vulnerability,  a paralinguistic openness to the life of the Other (2002, 125). In his cat’s  eye, for example, Derrida sees “a bottomlessness’, an alterity that is finally  ‘uninterpretable, unreadable, undecidable” by reason alone (2008, 12; cf.  McCance 2013, 147; Pedersen 2010, 9–10). Acknowledgment of the im- possibility of ever fully “knowing” the other animal intellectually forces us  to call on all our senses, our emotions and our sympathetic imagination.  In the Wood of No Names, for example, successful communication is  not by “chat” but by the eye and by feelings. Derrida argued that the key  to ethics is not your “eye/I” but the eye of the Other, looking at you, invit- ing you to adopt an ethics in which you are the addressee of the animal,  rather than its addressor. Consider the Fawn: “it looked at Alice with its  large gentle eyes, but didn’t seem at all frightened.... So they walked on  together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the  soft neck of the Fawn” (177). When this story is performed, some readers  can more easily feel “lovingly” toward an animal: that Edenic biophilia  they may have felt more strongly before they knew language. Derrida is  “speaking depuis ce temps. My passion for the animal is awakened at that  age” (2002, 390).  Carroll helps us feel the Adamic shift from gaze to language, from  biophilia to biophobia. When they leave the Wood of No Names, Fawn  recalls that she is named “Fawn” and that Alice is called “human” and “a  sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another  moment it had darted away at full speed” (178). By representing a Fall  into the net of language as well as into time (Derrida 2002, 386) Carroll  anticipates Lacan (1964) and Jameson (1975) as well as Derrida.  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 63 </page> <page sequence="8"> THE ETHICS OF EATING  In Eden, according to Derrida, originally all were vegetarians. Adam’s  mouth devoured the other animals’ “difference,” but not their corpses  (2008, 110). Hence, in some stories of origin, meat is a forbidden food.  To prefigure the Fall, Milton, for example, associates Satan with wolves,  lions, and tigers stalking animals to devour (Paradise Lost 4:183–87;  400–08). In Kipling’s “How Fear Came” (1895) and Richard Adams’s The  Plague Dogs (1977) “the Fall” is clearly from vegetarianism to what Mel- anie Joy calls “carnism” (2010, 30). Whatever the forbidden substance,  when the humans eat it the killing begins, first of other animals, then of  each other. According to Derrida, Cain “had been more faithful to God’s  arch-primary commandment” to be a gatherer rather than a hunter, but  after the Flood, God preferred the killer of animals, as if “the naming of  the animals was only a stage between their taming and their sacrifice....  The fratricide that results from it is marked as a sort of second original  sin, in this case twice linked to blood, since the murder of Abel follows— as its consequence—the sacrifice of the animal” (2008, 112–13). 20  Some of the results of this sacrifice are dramatized in chapter five of  Wonderland, “Advice from a Caterpillar.” When Alice eats from the left  side of the mushroom her neck grows so fast that her head emerges above  the forest. At first she seems to experience biophilia: she is “delighted” that  her neck is “like a serpent” (54), but as it extends up into the trees, Pigeon  shouts the word “Serpent” to scare her away from her eggs. Now, caught  in the net of language, she feels biophobia: afraid of being the “Serpent,”  Alice keeps trying to find some other “name” for her self. “ ‘I—I’m a little  girl,’ said Alice, rather doubtfully,” but she is struck dumb by Pigeon’s  repeated insistence that “there’s no use denying” that you eat eggs and are  therefore “a kind of serpent’.”21 While most readers of this chapter focus  on Caterpillar’s key question, “Who are YOU?” Pigeon asks the ultimate  question of posthumanism, “WHAT are you?’ ” Alice can’t answer this  question (in Derrida’s view there can be no definitive answer because one  can never fully “know” one’s own animality). With the Pigeon’s conclu- sion, “ ‘I can see you’re trying to invent something!’ ” (55), Carroll enacts  a fundamental question of animal ethics as well as posthumanism: can  we “invent” important, radical discontinuities between ourselves and the  other animals that justify treating them as inferiors?  64 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="9"> BIOPHILIA VS. BIOPHOBIA WITHIN THE SELF After Pigeon forces Alice to bring to the surface the denial that makes  possible devouring the corpse of the Other, we are not surprised that  Alice is determined to eat from the other side of the mushroom to get  small enough to escape “into the “beautiful garden” she saw soon after  she fell into the Rabbit Hole. However, as “Serpent,” Alice is not just a  carnivorous animal, but also, according to Genesis, the evil invader of  Eden. Alice/Serpent is but one of thousands of examples of the great Vic- torian archetype of the divided self. From the beginning, “this curious  child [Alice] was very fond of pretending to be two people” (18). As was  her creator: “even in official life, he became more and more two men,  Lewis Carroll and Charles Dodgson, sometimes with an imperative need  to keep them apart” (Greenacre 1955, 256). Of course “the divided self”  is a dangerous binary grossly oversimplifying our many subpersonalities,  but it focuses our attention on two basic feelings of emotive ethics evident  in the Fawn episode and throughout the Alice books: biophilia and bio- phobia. They are obviously “both/and” rather than “either/or” binaries:  for most people there will always be some fear even when love takes over  and some love even when fear dominates. However, Alice’s zoophobia, her  fears of the animal inside and outside her, remind us that Derrida’s goal  here, and often the primary work of emotive ethics, is to reveal the blocks  to the ideal, in this case the biophobia sabotaging the “friendly” chat with  bird and beast. Long before the word “biophobia” was in use, Carroll,  pretending that he forgot the story of Alice, wrote, “I think it was about  ‘malice” (1867, 48–49; cf. Auerbach 1973, 33).  Admittedly, Alice’s malice is rarely acknowledged. She remains a  popular character throughout the world partly because she is unusually  considerate, steadily developing her sympathetic imagination and her  compassion, not only for other humans, but also for the anthropomorphic  Dodo, the Caterpillar, and even for the Frog Footman, whose eyes are on  the top of his head. She even sympathizes with Bill the Lizard—after she  kicks him as hard as she could. As we have seen, at times she feels zoo- philia, love of animals, as in the Wood of No Names. However, Derrida  is more interested in her biophobia, which often overwhelms her, partly  because as a seven-year old she had a very limited ability to think for  herself, and is thus a good mouthpiece for her society and species. That is  to say, she is clearly caught in the net of language, in her case especially  “several nice little histories about children who had got...eaten up by wild  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 65 </page> <page sequence="10"> beasts” (17).22 This totally irrational paranoia (for the daughter of the  Dean of Oxford’s Christ Church in the nineteenth century), carries over  into the next chapter, “The Pool of Tears.” Here too Alice is preoccupied  with the question, “ ‘Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’ ”  (23). As so much of Alice’s identity is based on knowing human language  better than others her age, she tries to recite from memory one of the  most famous children’s poems of the time, Isaac Watts’s “Against Idleness  and Mischief.” However, apparently still preoccupied by wild beasts, her  “voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same  as they used to do.” Now she answers the subterranean question, “What  Am I?” rather differently: she replaces Watts’s busy bee with a lazy croco- dile who “cheerfully” grins and welcomes little fishes into his mouth “with  gently smiling jaws!’ ” (23).  One way for a child to deal with fear of crocodile jaws when playing  with others is to pretend to be the predator rather than the prey. Car- roll usually reserved such roles for boys like Bruno in Sylvia and Bruno  (1889). However, in the Alice books there is only one hero, so she must  oscillate between the stereotypically gendered roles. Throughout the Alice  books, instead of pretending to be a big, fierce male, Alice uses fear of  one animal (crocodile, cat, or dog) to dominate the rest of the animals.23  There are more answers to the question “What Am I?” as she and the  predator seem to merge, especially when the animal is a cat. Of course  most of Carroll’s readers, and presumably Alice herself, were aware of  popular ideals of morality such as “love thy neighbor as thyself” (KJV  Leviticus 19:18), but when she calls on cats and other predators to instill  fear in her prey, she reverts to an apparently more fundamental structure  of feeling, God’s promise that “the fear of you and the dread of you shall  be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all  that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea” (KJV Gen- esis 9:1–2). Alice’s crocodile smile foreshadows the gleeful deception and  devouring of the oysters by the walrus and the carpenter and the jovial  physical abuse of animals for entertainment throughout the books, from  the kicking of Bill the Lizard to the use of flamingos to hit hedgehogs, to  the smothering of the guinea pigs, to the shaking of the kitten.  66 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="11"> BIOIPHOBIA AND SADISM This kind of biophobia may well be the ultimate reason for Derri- da’s preoccupation with the Alice books. He concedes that “for Freud,  the death drive, the destruction drive, the originary ‘cruelty’ of ‘sadism’ or  ‘masochism,’ cannot be uprooted,” but Derrida insists that we oppose it  (2004, 123, 47), as does Carroll (1875a, 1875b). To resist this temptation  we must first admit its attraction. Carroll’s parodies tempt us to enjoy the  sadism, implicating us in the plot. The lazy crocodile replacing Watts’s  busy bee is in Carroll’s favorite genre, parody, a “counter-ode or satyr  play put on by the same actors—now in grotesque costume—who had  just appeared in a more serious drama” (Meckier 1987, 76). In the croco- dile poem, as so often in the Alice books, Carroll is “devastatingly sadis- tic but in so veiled and hidden a form as to produce tickling sensations  rather than clear awareness of attack...he furnishes an unconscious outlet  through humor for...primary destructive pressures without a provocation  to action. Readers are charmed and comforted rather than stimulated”  (Greenacre 1955, 145, 257).  Alice’s “primary destructive pressure” escalates in proportion to her  biophobia. For example, because the entrance to the garden is “not much  larger than a rat-hole” (15), to get in Alice must give up domination by  size and species and reduce herself to the lowly status of a prey animal  that would be grabbed, shaken, and devoured by her cat Dinah or the  neighbor’s rat terrier. Now not much larger than a mouse, Alice is far  more susceptible to paranoia. Because the door to the garden remains  locked, she cries until she slips into a pool of her own tears. “Up to her  chin in salt water,” Alice sees in the distance “a walrus or hippopotamus”  (25). Eventually she realizes it is a mouse, but the momentum of her fear,  no doubt combined with her society’s fear of rodents, drives her repeat- edly to call upon other predators to kill and eat him. As she does so the  predators become her alter egos. For instance, when Rabbit orders her  about, Alice supposes “Dinah will be sending me on messages next!” and  replies to a summons from her nurse: “Coming in a minute, nurse! But  I’ve got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back, and see that  the mouse doesn’t get out’ ” (38). As Dinah, she reveals the “cannibalistic  hunger” which Auerbach 1973 identified as the Original Sin for which  Alice is put on trial with the Knave of Hearts (36-41). According to Auer- bach 1973, the Cheshire cat’ symbolizes “Carroll’s focus on the organ of  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 67 </page> <page sequence="12"> the mouth, [one that] seems to have been consistent throughout his life”;  hence Auerbach argues that Alice’s mouth is the “ultimate symbol” of  her animality (1973, 39n, 46). From this perspective perhaps we need to  replace Derrida’s term “carnophallogocentrism” with a term that includes  female oral aggression as well. That aggression is quite striking when Alice asks Mouse if he knows  the way out of the Pool of Tears. He responds, as the Fawn will later, with  the eyes: “The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her  to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing” (26). In this first  scene of unknowing in the Alice books, Mouse’s eyes invite a wordless  openness to the being of the Other, a willingness to be the addressee of the  animal, rather than the addressor. How do we usually respond to such an  invitation? In this case, as in so many others, personal fear of the animal  merges with collective, historical biophobia to extinguish any possibil- ity of biophilia. Afraid that he was an enemy, “ ‘a French mouse, come  over with William the Conqueror’,” Alice asked him a very scary ques- tion: “ ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ ” He does indeed seem to understand French:  “Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over  with fright” (26).  Alice told him she “quite forgot you didn’t like cats,” but only to  toy with him, the way her cat Dinah might, but more sadistically, enjoy- ing Mouse’s fear as “sport,” as only a human could?24 Carroll now lets  Mouse speak human language: “ ‘Would you like cats if you were me?’ ”  Mouse asks a key ethical question: you are now my size; can you see  from my point of view? In other words, are you capable of extending the  sympathetic imagination, the basic requirement of morality, to animals?  The answer is more aggression: Alice tells Mouse that her cat Dinah is “a  capital one for catching mice’ ” (26). When Mouse is again traumatized,  Alice ostensibly promises that “we won’t talk about her any more if you’d  would rather not,” but she simply changes assault animal and attacks  again: “ ‘There is such a nice little dog near our house... it kills all the  rats.” Soon “Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go”  (27). In this parody a little English girl becomes “the Conqueror” and  the alien animal invader is defeated and sent swimming back across the  English channel. Nevertheless, once they all emerge from the Pool of Tears, the return  of Mouse and the expansion of the “friendly chat” to include birds and  68 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="13"> other small animals seems to succeed: “after a few minutes it seemed quite  natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had  known them all her life” (29). However, when Mouse gives a lecture on  the successful invasion of William the Conqueror (30) and tries to explain  his fear of cats and dogs; Alice once more ignores him. He flees, never to  return, again leaving the field to Alice the Conqueror. Alice has another  chance at a “friendly chat” with the birds, but, still overwhelmed with bio- phobia, she tells them “I wish I had our Dinah here...she’ll eat a little bird  as soon as look at it!’ ” (35). Needless to say, “Alice was soon left alone”  (36), in the human condition: alienated from all other animals. Biophobia also dominates chapter eight as Alice escalates from ver- bal sadism to physical abuse in the croquet game. Derrida notes that  his “poor hedgehogs will be badly treated,” presumably because “Alice  wanted to give the hedgehog a blow with the head of the flamingo she  held under her arm, [but] ‘it would twist itself round and look up in her  face.’ How can an animal look you in the face? That will be one of our  concerns’ ” (Derrida 2002, 377–78). It is also one of Levinas’s—the face  of the other, pleading, “Don’t kill me” (Levinas 1979, 198–99; cf. Doni- ger 1999, 104)—but Derrida argues that Levinas’s critique does not go  far enough (2008, 108). On the other hand, neither Derrida nor Levinas  comments on Alice’s apparently distinctively human version of sadism:  she “could not help bursting out laughing” (84). BIOPHOBIA AND THE HOLOCAUST ANALOGY  We can hear similar amusement now in the documentary Earthlings  (Monson 2005) when the desperate pigs are clearly trying to say the  equivalent of “don’t kill me,” but the slaughterhouse worker is laugh- ingly playing a game with them, killing as many as he can, as fast as he  can.25 The scale of slaughterhouse murder now is, of course, much, much  greater than in Carroll’s day. Derrida claims that “no one can deny [its]  unprecedented proportions” (2002, 394). But almost everyone does deny  the fact that we have organized “on a global scale the forgetting or misun- derstanding of this violence that some would compare to the worst cases  of genocide” (Derrida 2002, 394). Derrida reminds us how many whole  species have been annihilated as well as the holocaust of the food animals:  “as if, for example, instead of throwing people into ovens or gas cham- bers (let’s say Nazi) doctors and geneticists had decided to organize the  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 69 </page> <page sequence="14"> overproduction and overgeneration of Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals by  means of artificial insemination, so that, being more numerous and better  fed, they could be destined in always increasing numbers for the same hell,  that of the imposition of genetic experimentation or extermination by gas  or by fire” (2002, 395). How would Derrida have inscribed this horrific sadism in the Alice  books? Presumably, Carroll would have been shocked at the scale of the  current animal holocaust. However, knowledge of links between cruelty  to animals and cruelty to humans had been increasing since Hogarth’s  Four Stages of Cruelty (1751), Kant’s “Lectures on Ethics” (1775–81),  Trimmer’s History of the Robins (1786) and Schopenhauer’s “The Basis  for Morality” (1839). Carroll himself made the connection in “Some Pop- ular Fallacies About Vivisection” (1875b): “The hapless animal suffers,  dies, and there an end...but the man whose sympathies have been dead- ened, and whose selfishness has been fostered, by the contemplation of  pain deliberately inflicted, may be the parent of others equally brutalized,  and so, bequeath a curse to future ages” (online). In “Vivisection as a  Sign of the Times,” Carroll cited the Bible: “ ‘the whole creation groaneth  and travaileth in pain together,” adding, “travail it undoubtedly does still  (more than ever so far as brute creation is concerned)” (1875a, 170).  Looking ahead to increasing use of vivisection, Carroll anticipated “a cry  of anguish from the brute creation that will ring through the length and  breadth of the land” and predicted a time when the scientist “shall exult  in the thought that he has made of this fair green earth, if not a heaven for  man, at least a hell for animals” (1875a, 170).  Though making cruelty to animals amusing was banned almost by  definition from “children’s literature,” Carroll surpassed the Brothers  Grimm in this regard. For instance, after Alice’s threats of violence de- stroyed the family that seemed to coalesce after the Pool of Tears, she  encountered a family composed of a cook and a Duchess nursing a baby.  Abuse of the baby human leads to abandonment of a baby pig as the  distinction between human and animal dissolves. The baby “was sneez- ing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause” (60). Alice tried  to intervene, only to feel the horror of again being named “animal.” Pi- geon called her “Serpent” but the Duchess screamed the name “Pig!” with  “such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped” (61), presumably because  Alice was not just named “animal” but, even worse, identified with the  70 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="15"> slum-dwellers who, apparently breeding as rapidly as pigs, were threat- ening to overthrow the upper classes. However, when Alice realized the  animal name “was addressed to the baby, and not to her, she took cour- age” (61). The abuse quickly became physical: the cook started “throwing  everything within her reach at the Duchess” and at the baby named “Pig”;  Alice was soon “jumping up and down in an agony of terror” (61). This  conspicuous, emotional “witnessing” of the cruelty soon made Alice her- self a target of abuse: the Duchess, acting as if she had a guillotine or a  butcher at her command, yelled “ ‘chop off her head!’ ” Then the Duchess  “began shaking the baby violently” and threw it to Alice (62). Alice soon  realized her ethical dilemma: “ ‘If I don’t take this child away with me....  they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it be- hind?’ ” Just as she decides to save it, the baby’s animality is revealed and  Alice says, “ ‘If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear.... I’ll have nothing  more to do with you’.” On some level Alice knew that it was still murder  to leave the pig-baby behind. Admittedly, Alice did not kill plan on killing  the pig-baby herself, or even seeing it butchered, but there could be little  doubt what would become of it if it was captured. In Alice’s day, industrial  slaughter had already begun in large cities. Yet as a member of “the rich  and refined classes [who] shut these things out of sight and hearing,” as a  contemporary put it (Kingsford 1884, 64), Alice “felt quite relieved to see  it trot away quietly” (Carroll 2000, 63).  MUTINY OF THE OPPRESSED But what if the animal doesn’t go quietly to its death? Domination  and carnism are necessarily accompanied by fear of mutiny. Carroll was  aware of the parallels between animals and other suppressed groups in  this regard, protesting man’s “enslavement of his weaker brethren...the  labor of those who do not enjoy, for the enjoyment of those who do not  labor—the degradation of woman [and the] torture of the animal world— these are the steps of the ladder by which man is ascending to his higher  civilization” (1875a, 170). Earlier in the century one of Thackeray’s char- acters also said of women: “let us be thankful that the darlings are like  the beasts of the field, and don’t know their own power. They would over- come us entirely if they did.”26 In fact, a female instigates a mutiny against  Queen Alice at the royal banquet attended by the animals at the end of  Looking Glass. Like Pigeon, the Red Queen made Alice face the shock and  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 71 </page> <page sequence="16"> shame of the carnism that Derrida and others would identify as Original  Sin. The Red Queen boldly brought to the surface the dinner-table secret  that everyone knows but wants to keep hidden: “ ‘You look a little shy;  let me introduce you to that leg of mutton’.... The leg of mutton got up in  the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned the bow, not  knowing whether to be frightened or amused” (261). As the Red Queen  made Alice admit the fact that the “leg of mutton” was an animal mur- dered for her, Alice’s fear soon triumphed over her fun. She threatened it  with her knife, but the Red Queen granted it the same status as a human:  “ ‘Certainly not,’ the Red Queen said, very decidedly: ‘it isn’t etiquette to  cut any one you’ve been introduced to.’” To “cut” was a pun, of course,  also meaning to insult by pretending not to see people whom you know,  ignoring them as if they don’t exist. It was obvious to all the animals at  the banquet that Alice pretended not to know that the “mutton” was still  alive as she prepared to cut and eat it. Because of Alice’s poor etiquette,  if not ethics, the Red Queen replaced the mutton with a plum pudding  (made with animal fat). This time Alice quickly proceeded to “cut a slice  and handed it to the Red Queen” (262). Then comes the biggest surprise so far. The leg of mutton communi- cated only by movement, but Pudding speaks human language: “ ‘What  impertinence!...I wonder how you’d like it, if I were to cut a slice out of  YOU, you creature!’” Alice’s biophobia grew as the pudding “spoke in a  thick, suety sort of voice...Alice hadn’t a word to say in reply: she could  only sit and look at it and gasp” (263). The previous threat of cutting a  live sheep tapped into the powerful political feelings at the time gener- ated by vivisection of animals, but Pudding’s threat of slicing Alice herself  drew upon the fears, later articulated by Carroll himself, that vivisection  research would be extended to humans (Carroll 1875a, 1875b, 1885).  Alice came up with a Final Solution. She pulled the tablecloth out  from under them, and they were all “disappeared,” with one exception.  The instigator of the mutiny, the Red Queen, “dwindled down to the size  of a little doll” was “merrily running” on the table: “ ‘As for YOU,’ she  repeated.... ‘I’ll shake you into a kitten, that I will!’” (2000, 266). A whole  chapter is then devoted to this “Shaking.” We recall the Duchess shaking  the pig-baby, but this time it is newly crowned Alice who deliberately  shakes the queen-kitten hybrid “backwards and forwards with all her  might” until the transformation from human to animal is complete (267).  72 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="17"> For some readers, no doubt, the afterimage is that of a rat terrier shaking  a kitten with enough force to kill it. What would be the response be today  if a video of such a performance appeared on YouTube?  No doubt Derrida’s audience was grateful that he did not show videos  of cruelty to animals. “Instead of thrusting these images in your faces or  awakening them in your memory,” he focused on “the sharing of this suf- fering.” He identified “a new experience of this compassion . . . voices are  raised—minority, weak, marginal voices, little assured of their discourse,  to awaken us” (2002, 395). Derrida’s essay thus moves farther beyond a  Benthamite calculus of rights and values, to one that supplements analytic  philosophy with Bentham’s famous statement, the “question is not, Can  they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?” (1789, XVII).  COMPASSIONATE GRIEF The compassion (“suffering with”) that Bentham called for can also  be detected in the Alice books. After the croquet game, for example, Alice  “saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely...sighing as  if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply.” Alice thus seemed to  be making progress. In the beginning, she said to herself, rather sharply,  “ ‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!... I advise you to leave off this  minute!’” (18). Now, however, in addition to all her fears, she also feels  what Aristotle called pity, thus experiencing both of the emotions that  Aristotle ascribed to the reader/viewer of tragedy. However, Aristotle’s  “eleos” is more accurately translated as “compassionate grief” (Stanford  1983, 23–24). “Pity” is too ambiguous because “in modern use” it some- times implies “disdain or mild contempt for a person as intellectually or  morally inferior” (Oxford English Dictionary 1992) Alice doesn’t dismiss  the Mock Turtle’s sadness in this way perhaps because she is beginning  to recognize the inferiority of her own emotional intelligence: she almost  drowned in her own pool of tears.  In any case, the Mock Turtle’s grief becomes a chance for another  “friendly chat” with an animal. “ ‘What is his sorrow?’ she asked his com- panion, the Gryphon,” who gave the stereotypical male answer: “ ‘it’s all  his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!’ ” (95). In  this context, the Gryphon represents the fear and “denial” 27 of emotion  that is the foundation of “rational” civilization and, some feminists say,  of analytic moral philosophy (Grosz 1993, Sanbonmatsu 2011, Adams,  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 73 </page> <page sequence="18"> 2011, Plumwood 2000). Alice enforces this rule against the male in her  little family drama in the opening of Looking Glass: when the King tries  to write down his feelings she immediately distracts him. Stereotypically, males must repress sorrow, yet it pervades Carroll’s  writing, partly because he could not return fully to what he thought was  the innocence of Eden and early childhood. His contemporary, Dickens,  suggested that if we all had the hearts of children “what a heaven this  earth would be!“ but concluded that “the faint image of Eden which is  stamped upon [us] in childhood, chafes and rubs in our rough struggles  with the world, and soon wears away: too often to leave nothing but a  mournful blank”(Nicholas Nickleby, Ch. 6, “The Five Sisters of York,”  online) Derrida would add that those who are not entirely “blank” can  feel at times our collective alienation from our animal past and from our  own animality, as well as grief for habitually killing and eating members  of our own extended family. For many, this grief just below the surface  must not be acknowledged, much less tapped, lest they drown in their  own Pool of Tears. In this regard, Derrida cites a “tradition [that] assigns  to nature and to the animality named by Adam a sort of ‘deep sadness  (Traurigkeit)’...the great sorrow of nature” which gives rise to a “mute  but audible lament through the sensuous breath and rustling of plants”  (2002, 388). A similar feeling can be detected at the end of Wonderland  when “the lowing of the cattle in the distance [takes] the place of the  Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs” (126). The book’s professional illustrator, John  Tenniel, made this connection clear from the beginning when he drew the  Mock Turtle with a calf’s head and hind hooves, reminding the reader that  in Mock Turtle soup, brains and organ meats, often from cattle, are sub- stituted for turtle. Today, sadness is inevitably associated with veal calves  because they are now “tenderized” on the hoof in industrial agriculture  by being put in tiny crates and tethered by the neck so they can’t move for  the rest of their lives. Carroll’s calf-turtle, apparently has another sadness:  he is consciously aware that his fate is to be killed and devoured, perhaps  in a few months. This aspect of the plot certainly poses possibilities for an  Aristotelian sense of tragedy and “compassionate grief.” TOWARD A NEW ETHICS OF COMPASSION Emotional appeals like this, according to Derrida, are weapons in “a  war being waged” between those who appeal to compassion and “those  74 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="19"> who violate not only animal life but even and also this sentiment.” He  insists that we are all “obliged to become soldiers in this war” (2002,  397).28 Derrida’s talk of “thinking” this war would no doubt be dismissed  by an activist as typical of a philosopher, one who produces only abstract  documents ignored by the common people. But Derrida also stresses ver- bal emotional appeals and bearing witness, the first steps toward political  action. Consider the final chapter of Joy’s popular activist book, titled  “Seeing with the Heart: The Power of Witnessing” (2010, 137). In her  definition of the word, “when we bear witness, we are not merely acting  as observers: we emotionally connect with the experience of those we are  witnessing. We empathize. And in so doing, we close the gap in our con- sciousness, the gap that enables the violence of carnism to endure” (Joy  2000, 138). But we must take sides: “as Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and  Holocaust survivor Eli Wiesel points out, ‘Neutrality helps the oppressor,  never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented’’’  (Joy 2000, 150). “Witnessing the Zeitgeist,” as well as acknowledging our  own denial, can lead to the collective witnessing of boycotts, “demonstra- tions, vigils.... lectures, and artistic creations.” As one of those creations,  literature has a vital role to play: “the power of speaking the unspeakable  lifts the barriers of denial and repression” (139; cf. Herman 1997, 1). An interview with Derrida recalls Alice‘s “witnessing” the abuse of  the pig-baby as well as her refusal to think about the pig’s fate.29 Der- rida is asked, “how is it possible to reconcile this desire to reduce ani- mal suffering with the necessity for industrial organization in raising and  slaughtering animals?” (2004, 70). Derrida answers, “the consumption  of meat has never been a biological necessity,”30 and then he interrogates  the interviewer as aggressively as the Pigeon cross-examined Alice. First,  he asks the interviewer to climb down the ladder of abstraction to be an  “eye” witness: “when one sees an incalculable number of calves, raised on  hormones and stuffed into a truck, on their way from the stable straight  to the slaughterhouse, how can we not imagine that they suffer? We know  what animal suffering is, we feel it ourselves. Moreover, with industrial  slaughter, these animals are suffering in much larger numbers than be- fore” (2004, 70–71). The interviewer ignores this example, seeming to  “cut” the calves, by pretending not to see them. Derrida insists that if she  sees the “spectacle man creates for himself in his treatment of animals  [it] will become intolerable.... If you were actually placed every day be- JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 75 </page> <page sequence="20"> fore the spectacle of this industrial slaughter, what would you do?” The  interviewer finally responds, “I wouldn’t eat meat anymore, or I would  live somewhere else. But I prefer not to see it, even though I know that  this intolerable thing exists. I don’t think that the visibility of a situation  allows one to know it better. Knowing is not the same as looking.” Indeed,  it isn’t. Derrida refuses to let her “cut” the calves by the usual intellectual  denial of substituting abstractions for seeing and feeling: “But if every  day, there passed before your eyes, slowly, without giving you time to be  distracted, a truck filled with calves leaving the stable on the way to the  slaughterhouse, would you be unable to eat meat for a long time?” (2004,  71). The interviewer’s denial becomes more obvious: “I would move away.  But really, sometimes I believe that, in order to understand a situation bet- ter and to have the necessary distance, it is best not to be an eyewitness to  it” (2004, 72). Nevertheless, by forcing another to witness her own denial,  however briefly, as the Pigeon did to Alice, Derrida too has shown us how  to raise consciousness of the need for a new environmental ethic. But what happened after Pigeon forced Alice to witness her own de- nial? What effect did that and her other interactions with animals have on  Alice’s compassion? At the end of Looking Glass she says to her real kit- ten, “To-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you’re  eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’ to you;  and then you can make believe it’s oysters, dear!’ ” (271). The most fa- mous account of ethics in the Alice books is the deception that leads the  young oysters to be eaten alive. It is the animal, not the human, who  feels disgrace: “ ‘It seems a shame’, the Walrus said, / To play them such a  trick”; the animal, not the human feels sympathy: “ ‘I weep for you’, the  Walrus said: / ‘I deeply sympathize’.” Hence Alice prefers the Walrus be- cause he “was a little sorry for the poor oysters” (187). When Tweedledee  points out that the Walrus, “with sobs and tears,” ate the largest ones,  Alice prefers the Carpenter, until she is informed that he ate as many as  he could—one of the best examples of the situation-specific ethics in the  Alice books. The editor of the Alice books adds this note: “This was a puz- zler” for her: “the ethical dilemma of having to choose between judging a  person in terms of acts or in terms of intentions” (188n). Alice concludes  that they “were both unpleasant characters” (188). Carroll’s operetta ver- sion of the Alice books confirms this judgment: both unpleasant charac- ters sob, but when “they laid them down to sleep — / And of their craft  76 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="21"> and cruelty / The punishment to reap, [oyster ghosts punished them both]  by stamping on their chests” (187n). What did Alice learn from the Walrus  and the Carpenter? Not much. Derrida presumably would point out she  emerges from the underground as the most “unpleasant character of all,”  with less sympathy for oysters than either the Walrus or the Carpenter.  Indeed, as she “treats” the kitten to a performance of the story no doubt  Alice vicariously enjoys again the subtle sadism of the betrayal and the  eating of the live oysters.  Of course in this case the animals are already dead, and the kitten,  like the walrus, has no choice: it cannot survive without meat. However,  the challenges of the leg of mutton, the Pudding, and the Pigeon raise  our awareness that for most humans eating meat is a decision, one to  be made consciously. As Tolstoy put it, “ ‘A man can live and be healthy  without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates  in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite. And to act so is  immoral. It is so simple and indubitable that it is impossible to not agree  with it” (1896, 170–71). Hence the answer to Pigeon’s question “What  are You?” seems to be, “I am the cruelest animal: the one who chooses to  kill and devour the other animals even though I need not do so.”  What are the alternatives to Alice’s recalcitrance? How does Derrida  react to his own cat? In the opening scene of his essay he faces the gaze  of his cat, eyes that seems to haunt him throughout the rest of the essay:  “a real cat, truly, believe me, a little cat. It isn’t the figure of a cat” (2002,  375). After listing many literary cats he concludes, “it is not even the one  who speaks in Alice in Wonderland” (the Cheshire cat); but then he adds,  “ ‘really a little cat’ was a quote from Carroll’s penultimate chapter con- sisting of a single sentence: ‘it really was a kitten, after all’ ” (2002, 376).  Nevertheless, Derrida objects to the ease with which Alice switches be- tween literary and “real” animals, and especially to her Cartesian com- plaint that because animals do not respond in our terms they do not  respond at all. Alice’s Dinah was also a real cat observed by Carroll and  members of the Liddell household, and presumably her kittens were real  cats (they certainly ignored Alice when she told them what to do). Derrida  evaluates Alice’s speech to one of these “real” kittens: “You can speak to  an animal, to the cat said to be real inasmuch as it is an animal, but it  doesn’t reply, not really, not ever, that is what Alice concludes. Exactly like  Descartes” (2002, 378).  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 77 </page> <page sequence="22"> CONCLUSION Derrida, on the other hand, stresses that his cat is a mystery rather  than a machine, an “irreplaceable living being that one day enters my  space. Nothing can ever take away from me the certainty that what we  have here is an existence that refuses to be conceptualized” (2002, 377– 78). Derrida’s rejection of an ethics composed only of linguistic abstrac- tions is based on his belief that “ethics itself is caught up in language, and  therefore cannot lay claim to the kind of self-presence or mastery that it  often denies to living others” (Derrida 2008, 23, 41). Hence Derrida adds  a feeling—compassion—to abstraction, focusing on the ultimate connec- tion between himself and his cat, the ineluctable suffering of “mortal ex- istence”: “for from the moment that it has a name, its name survives it. It  signs its potential disappearance. Mine also, and this disappearance, from  that moment to this, fort/da, is announced each time...one of us leaves the  room” (2002, 377–78). Haraway’s complaint that this is but abstract musing (Haraway 2007,  22; cf. Warkentin 2009, 101) ignores Derrida’s integration of literary ci- tations into his philosophy. In this instance Derrida soon invokes many  more deaths over a longer stretch of time: the perspective of the cat in  Rilke’s “Schwarze Katze” (1907) who turns her face to yours;  and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny,  inside the golden amber of her eyeballs suspended, like a prehistoric fly.  This is a concise illustration of how the verbal imagination invites  us to “see” with our mind’s eye. While Carroll pointed beyond words to  the visual communication of the eyes of a mouse, a flamingo, and a fawn,  Derrida’s focus on the eye of a cat reminds us that we have only begun to  explore what we can learn about ourselves and the Other when we look  “through the looking glass” that is the eye of animal. That eye embodies a  history of all species, of all life, of the complete environment, the universe.  The attentive reader is emotionally “moved by a single, surprising image”  of biophilia, of “unity in a search back through time” (Wilson 1984, 63),  awakening the feeling of oneness with all species that can replace the bio- phobia that drives environmental destruction, anthropocentrism and sad- 78 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="23"> ism. Promoting such “positive emotion-saturated attitudes with respect to  the environment” (Ulrich 1993, 117–18) will increase the probability that  philosophical ethics can change the world. Consider Carroll’s citation of  Herbert Spencer: “ ‘Not by precept, though heard daily; not by example,  unless it is followed; but only by action, often caused by the related feel- ing, can a moral habit be formed” (Carroll 1875a, 169, italics added). NOTES  1 Animal studies must be interdisciplinary because “none of our extant dis- courses is adequate for thinking and describing animal life and rethinking  animal-human relations” (Colarco 2008, 5–6; cf. McCance 2013, 77). See  also Gorman 2012; Rohman 2009, 160; McCance 2013, 136. McCance pro- vides an excellent overview of the field as a whole, Weil 2012 of the philoso- phy. For literary animal studies see Rhoman 2009 and the twelve articles on  literature and animal studies in PMLA 2009 124(2): 472–563. An animal  studies teaching agenda has been initiated in “more than 143 universities in  the U.S., and 48 more in” other countries, integrating “philosophy, English,  criminology, history, sociology, religion, anthropology, women’s studies, so- cial work, psychology, and counseling” (Arkow 2012, xiv); see also Pedersen  2010, 1–14, and Ambruster 2008, 72–80. DeMello 2012 is an excellent ex- ample of a graduate textbook in this new field and Gruen 2011 and Waldau  2013 of undergraduate textbooks.   2 Smuts (1999): “ ‘Open your heart to the animals around you and find out  for yourself what it’s like to befriend a nonhuman person’ ” (120; McCance  2013, 134).   3 “Biophilia” Oxford English Dictionary: “3. A love of or empathy with the nat- ural world, esp. when seen as a human instinct”; “philia” is defined as “amity,  affection, friendship; fondness, liking.” Versus “Biophobia”: “(b) avoidance of  contact with animals, plants, or organic materials; strong aversion to aspects  of the natural world”; “phobia”: “fear, horror, strong dislike, or aversion.”   4 The usual term is “affective” (Weil 2012, 7). However, “affect” for some  readers connotes abstract psychological theory instead of feeling. The word  “feeling,” on the other hand, suggests bodily sensations, especially touch; in  psychology the word sometimes explicitly excludes thought. Because “emo- tion” has come to mean an agitation of mind or feeling, “emotive” may be the  best name for an approach to ethics that integrates thought and feeling.   5 Homilies On The First Epistle of John 7:8, presumably a permutation of “per- fect love casts out fear” (KJV 1 John 4). However, English is so impoverished  in words for “love” that it is almost impossible to translate Augustine’s cari- tas. In the East apparently the ideal would be Buddhist “loving-kindness,”  but an older and more widespread oriental ideal is ahimsa: nonviolence  JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 79 </page> <page sequence="24"> in thought, word, and deed, something more akin to Derrida’s “passivity”  (2008, 27; McCance 2013, 68). In Jainism, on the other hand, the emphasis  is on being with those who are suffering, more like Derrida’s “compassion.”   6 Cf. Schopenhauer 1839, “Compassion is the true moral incentive” (209). Also  consider Kundera’s explanation of “compassion” in Eastern European and  other languages as “feeling with” rather than just “suffering with” (1984, 30).  7 “This was the first part of a ten-hour address Derrida gave at the third Ceri- sy-la-Salle conference devoted to his work, in July 1997. The title of the con- ference was ‘L’Animal autobiographique’ Later segments of the address dealt  with Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas” (Derrida, 2002, 369n).   8 An analogy made in the sixties by Isaac Bashevis Singer and more recently by  Coetzee, Derrida, and others. Sztybel 2006 argued for thirty-nine similarities.  Derrida, in his next talk in the series (“But as for me, who am I?”) cites Ador- no’s assertion that in an idealist system “animals play virtually the same role  as Jews did for a fascist system” and suggests that “one could easily extend  [this], according to the now familiar outlines of the same logic, to a certain  hatred of femininity, even childhood” (Derrida 2008, 103–04 ).   9 A feminist endorsement: “Derrida asserts that the mistreatment of animals is  a scandal that is worth getting hysterical about and defends the emotional ap- proach to animal ethics” (Donovan and Adams 2007, 15). However, there are  many feminist objections to Derrida. His high level of abstraction has been  critiqued by Grosz 1997, for example, and Haraway 2007 complained that  “philosophers like Derrida are unlikely to read, cite, or recognize as philos- ophy the large feminist literature on animal studies that was often both first  and also less entrammeled in the traps of misrecognizing animals as singular”  (334n.)   10 Literature also has the advantage for emotive ethics of being associated with  a long tradition of reader-response literary criticism that focuses on emotion.  Aristotle’s discussion of pity and fear in the viewer/reader of tragedy and  Wordsworth’s defense of a poetry of feeling are two of the more famous  examples. In the last forty years some feminists, reader-response critics, and  composition theorists have also stressed that truth is emotional as well as in- tellectual. Christian (1987) resurrected the traditional definition of literature  as that which is written to evoke feeling as well as to express thought” (51),  offering “the possibility of the integration of feeling/knowledge, rather than  the split between the abstract and the emotional in which Western philoso- phy inevitably indulged” (56). The importance of student emotions in college  literature and composition classrooms was explored (Bleich 1975; Tompkins  1977, 1987; Brand 1980, 1989; Steig 1989, Berman 1994, Bump 2000), and  some literary critics reminded us that knowledge is produced by reader iden- tification with characters’ feelings (Novitz 1980, 1987; Feagin 1988, 1996).  By the end of the century the momentum shifted to other studies of emotion  80 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="25"> (Hjort and Laver, 1997). Now, in the twenty-first century, the rising popu- larity of queer studies and of Raymond William’s sense of emotions as cul- tural “structures of feeling” supports a new focus on feelings. In 2004, Dawes  noted that “an interest in the . . . emotions that shake us when reading has  in recent years come increasingly to the fore in literary and cultural studies”  (437). In 2010 Bump called for an “ ‘emotive’ literary criticism focusing on  the feelings, moods, and emotional fields in readers as well as texts” (148).   11 Take, for example, the family emotional atmosphere “that, in turn, influences  the emotional functioning of each person. It is analogous to the gravitational  field of the solar system, where each planet and the sun, by virtue of their  mass, contribute gravity to the field and are, in turn, regulated by the field  they help create. One cannot `see’ gravity, nor can one `see’ the emotional  field. The presence of gravity and the emotional field can be inferred, how- ever, by the predictable ways planets and people behave in reaction to one  another” (Kerr 1988, 54–5).  12 Instead of a common phrase such as “casual cruelty” or a more controversial  term such as “cannibalism” (Auerbach 1973, 37), “sadism” may be the best  term here in the general sense of “enthusiasm for inflicting pain, suffering, or  humiliation on others” (OED). This is the sense of the word as used by Der- rida 2002 and Greenacre 1955, not the specialized sense of “a psychological  disorder characterized by sexual fantasies” (OED). Martin Gardner, the edi- tor of The Annotated Alice (2002), admitted that there are “sadistic elements  in Alice” (xv). Carroll certainly knew the meaning of the word. In his vivisec- tion letters he concluded that “It is a humiliating but an undeniable truth, that  man has something of the wild beast [sic] in him, that a thirst for blood can  be aroused in him by witnessing a scene of carnage, and that the infliction of  torture, when the first instincts of horror have been deadened by familiarity,  may become, first, a matter of indifference, then a subject of morbid interest,  then a positive pleasure, then a ghastly and ferocious delight” (1875b). Car- roll denounced “all infliction of death or suffering for the purpose of mere  sport...mere pleasure” (1875b). His examples included the case of medical  students at a vivisection of “living dogs. When the unfortunate creatures cried  and moaned under the operations, many of the students actually mimicked  their cries in derision “(1875b).   13 The word “friendly” conveys the meaning of the Greek philia in biophilia,  distinguishing that kind of love from eros, agape, and storge; see Santas 2014.  All quotations from the Alice books are from the Annotated Alice (2000).  Incidentally, obsession with the Alice books is not unique: Joyce Carol Oates  2014 said, they “changed my life...made me yearn to be a writer as well as  inspired me to ‘write’ ” (12).  14 Cf. Auerbach 1973: “Alice’s essential nature is revealed by her attitude to- ward animals” (43). JEROME BUMP BIOPHILIA AND EMOTIVE ETHICS 81 </page> <page sequence="26">  15 Slicer asks, “Should environmental philosophers pay attention to narratives  because they contain certain truths that are only possible through story and  because stories elicit practical wisdom? Should philosophers be writing such  narratives?” (2003, 1).  16 See, for example, the bibliography in Heath’s The Philosopher’s Alice 1974,  pp. 244–46.  17 Freud’s word for the condensation that occurs in dreams.  18 “The capacity for biophilia can be “snuffed out” or promulgated by edu- cation: “like the capacity to love,” it requires “instruction, example, and  validation by a caring adult...active participation of parents, grandparents,  teachers” (Orr 1993, 433, 428). Emotive ethics is best taught to children by  example rather than precepts. As Claudia put it in Toni Morrison’s The Bluest  Eye (1970), when she listens to adults “the edge, the curl, the thrust of their  emotions is always clear to Frieda and me. We do not, cannot, know the  meanings of all the words, for we are nine and ten years old. So we watch  their faces, their hands, their feet, and listen for truth in timbre” (15).   19 For examples of the role of popular culture see Caputi 2007 and Brooker  2004.   20 Cf. Kundera 1984. Animals “were never expelled from Paradise.” “Humani- ty’s true moral test, its fundamental test, consists of its attitude towards those  who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect human kind has suffered a  fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it”  (289, 297).   21 Cognitive ethology research has discovered an apparently instinctive associa- tion of humans with serpents: vervets have a distinctive sound to warn others  of the approach of a serpent; the only other use of that sound is to warn of  the approach of humans.   22 This kind of paranoia is much greater today thanks to the power of multime- dia, whether children’s cartoons or “documentaries” about fearful predators.  Fortunately, multimedia can also be used to combat these phobias: see, for  example, Mooallem 2014. On the other hand, this kind of phobia reminds  us that literature can be a cause of the problem as well as a solution. In other  words, if literature can be bibliotherapy (Bump 1989, 1990), it can also be  what I would call “bibliopathology.”  23 For some Victorian readers this may well have recalled how another female,  Queen Victoria, used Sikhs to control the other natives of India during the  mutiny of 1857, source of one of the greatest Victorian political fears (Her- bert 2008, 2).   24 Cats, of course, if well fed, do seem to play with mice, but one could argue  that they are only developing their hunting skills and/or that they have a kind  of innocence no longer available to humans. Carroll’s Sylvie asserts that God  “loves every living thing. Even sinful men. How much more the animals that  82 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(2) 2014 </page> <page sequence="27"> cannot sin” (1889, 154). Mark Twain provided a more secular explanation:  “Of all the animals, man is the only one that is cruel. He is the only one that  inflicts pain for the pleasure of doing it. It is a trait that is not known to the  higher animals.... Cats are loose in their morals, but not consciously so. Man,  in his descent from the cat, has brought the cat’s looseness with him but has  left the unconsciousness behind (the saving grace which excuses the cat). The  cat is innocent, man is not” (Twain 2010, 119–20).  25 “A WORKER SHOOTS A PIG WITH A CAPTIVE BOLT GUN, BUT MISSES.  WE HEAR HIM SING: ‘Oh, I missed. I missed you, honey. But I’ll get you  again!’ HE FIRES ONCE MORE AND THE PIG GOES INTO CONVUL- SIONS. THE WORKER SAYS: ‘I got you! Good boy!’ ” Earthlings screenplay  (Monson 2005, caps in transcript).   26 Vanity Fair, 1848, Ch. 4. In the following century Orwell’s Animal Farm is an  obvious representation of the parallels between fear of mutiny of animals and  fear of mutiny of the lower classes.  27 “Denial” is being used here not only in the Freudian but also the ecofeminist  sense of “denial of human animality and of ecological embeddedness” (Wark- entin 2010, 103).  28 Derrida’s imagery of a war in which we are called to be soldiers and do our  duty against “those who violate not only animal life but even and also this  sentiment” of compassion (2002, 397) is obviously a masculinist metaphor.  Nevertheless, Adams accepts Derrida’s terminology without qualification,  perhaps because she insists on the political dimension of a feminist ethic of  care (2007, 33; cf. McCance 2013, 94–95).  29 This interview seems to have been ignored by those, such as David Clark  (1997, 177; cf. McCance 2013, 148), who do not believe that Derrida sup- ported vegetarianism.  30 An arguable point, especially for people who have little or no access to vege- tation. See Sturgeon 2009.
