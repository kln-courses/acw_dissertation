BRINKMAN* Abstract From the fourteenth to the seventh centuries B.C., Babylonian royal land grants and related documents were often engraved on stone stelae, which were decorated with divine symbols, inscribed with elaborate curses against offenders, and placed in a temple. These stone memo rials (traditionally called kudurrus) throw light on contemporary legal and economic practices with individual cases involving property rights, royal patronage, family disputes, overzealous functionaries, temple offices and income, and taxation woes. This article assesses a new book which discusses the form and function of these stelae. Du XIVe au VIIe s. av.

Introduction The history of independent Babylonia is framed between two eras of politi cal prominence, that of the founding Old Babylonian dynasty (1894-1595 B.C.), typified by Hammurabi the conqueror and lawgiver, and that of the culminating imperial Neo-BabyIonian dynasty (626-539 B.C.), epitomized by Nebuchad nezzar II of biblical fame. Between these two well-known periods lies almost a millennium of relative obscurity, spanned by a series of dynasties without charismatic rulers of comparable stature. The political, social, and economic his tory of these intervening centuries, which could be termed the Babylonian "Middle Ages," must be pieced together slowly and painstakingly from a var iegated mix of sources, textual and archeological. One of the more promising source types known from this intermediate period is the so-called kudurru. These are Babylonian documents?often written on stone and sometimes embellished with symbols in relief?which deal with finan cial concerns: real estate, tax exemptions, temple offices, and personal property. More than 160 of these texts, dating from a range of at least seven centuries (from the mid-fourteenth century to the mid-seventh century B.C.) are presently known. From these documents, historians have reconstructed a substantial part of what is known about contemporary Babylonian province structure, land tenure, taxation systems, temple finances, and tribal and extended family rela tionships during these poorly understood Middle Ages. The book under review here is a revised version of a doctoral dissertation submitted to Harvard University in 1997.1 It is the first large-scale treatment in more than eighty years to deal with the kudurrus as documents, and to this it adds an archeological dimension. The author promises a fresh look at the mate rial and new perspectives based on a holistic interpretation?viewing the "inte grated textual, visual, and artifactual features of the kudurrus" together in order to appreciate "their indigenous function within their original ancient setting" (p. 13). As a result of her investigations, Slanski advances a series of theses:2 1. these stone artifacts are designated in their own inscriptions as nar?, i.e., "(stone) monument" (pp. 19, 180); kudurru, the term traditionally used by scholars, is a misnomer (pp. 19, 59, 247); 2. the inscriptions on these artifacts commemorate the acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement to an ongoing source of income (pp. 180, 234); 1 Under the slightly different title "A Study in the Form and Function of the Babylonian kudurrus." A simplified summary of the main points of the dissertation was published in Slanki 2000. 2 Page references in the following list are illustrative, not exhaustive.</page><page sequence="3">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 3 3. hence a more appropriate designation for these objects is "Entitlement nar?" (pp. 151, 288); 4. the inscriptions have a uniform structure (pp. 65, 100-1, 167, 288); 5. the inscriptions take pains to ensure that the entitlement is permanent, i.e., hereditary (pp. 115-6, 143, 180); 6. these artifacts were deposited in temples; they were not placed on fields as boundary markers (pp. 55-9, 305-7); 7. these artifacts were decorated with symbols of gods or with cultic or mun dane scenes and properly belong to the category of monument rather than that of legal document (pp. 160-6, 235, 269, 288); 8. the development of this genre shows the usurpation of a former royal pre rogative by non-royal officials or institutions (pp. 269-70, 289), indicating a lessening of central authority and exemplifying a "series of broader social changes taking place in Babylonia and throughout the ancient Near East" (pp. 281-4). To avoid prejudgment on the relative suitability of the words nar? versus kudurru to designate the items under discussion, I will in the following pages refer to these pieces mostly by neutral terms such as "artifact" or "object." In this review, after brief remarks on a definition of this source type (and its rel evance to clarifying the extent of the corpus of objects under consideration), I will examine each of the author's theses in turn.3 I will then continue with a reconsideration of the corpus, remark on the quality of the author's overall pre sentation, and offer a few general conclusions. Finally, I will append a brief excursus on the historical development of the genre. 2. Formal Definition of the Genre Early in the book, the author stresses the need to establish a formal definition for the genre. "Studying the kudurrus without a formal definition is comparable to building a house without a plan" (p. 12). Yet she nowhere presents such a definition. Even chapter 5, entitled "A Formal Definition for the Babylonian Entitlement nar?s" (pp. 149-82), offers no definition, though one could boil down one of its concluding paragraphs to mark some essential characteristics 3 During the final stages of preparation of this review, I have benefitted from the obser vations in Charpin 2002 (actually published in November 2004), a critical appraisal of Slanski's book which adds useful comparisons with Old Babylonian practices. It should not be presumed, however, that titles or expressions used in Old Babylonian necessarily have the same meaning in the Kassite period (e.g., mu-?s-sa, cited by Charpin 2002: 180 n. 73, but see Brinkman 1976: 403, 448-51). In so far as possible here, I have tried to avoid duplicat ing points made in Charpin's review.</page><page sequence="4">4 J.A. BRINKMAN of the genre: "stone artifacts in the shape of stelae, tablets, or plaques . . . designated in their inscriptions as nar?s, that is '(stone) stelae' or '(stone) monuments'... describe the acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement to an ongoing source of income, and take pains to ensure that the entitlement be permanent, that is, hereditary . . . sculpted with symbols of the gods and occasionally also with cultic or mundane scenes" (p. 180). But perhaps the most succinct statement may be found in a later chapter, on p. 234: Fashioned out of stone, inscribed with text according to a set pattern, sculpted with a distinctive repertoire of visual imagery, and placed in temples, these artifacts performed a unique and consistent function: the commemoration and perpetuation of entitlement to a [sic] on-going source of income. Yet even these approximations to definitions are not followed by the author in practice. In chapter 6, "Debatable Members of the Corpus," she explicitly includes within the genre artifacts of two additional physical types: stone tablets without reliefs and clay cones (also without reliefs).4 These she adduces pri marily because of their texts, which fit a documentary typology deduced earlier from 65 "datable inscriptions,"5 which she takes as her basic textual corpus for analysis.6 By "datable" she means assignable to the reign of a specific king because the text either mentions the name of a monarch or alludes to a person or persons who can be dated to a particular reign. In fact these 65 datable texts, which are listed in Appendix 1, are used not only to establish the literary pat tern for the genre, but also as the principal body of evidence from which she draws conclusions on other matters (e.g., ancient terminology for the objects themselves, types of legal actions represented, artistic imagery). She imposes this restriction on the focus of her study in order to "enable evaluation of chronological developments" within the genre (p. 66). 4 Slanski in her chapter on Formal Definition mentions the clay objects on pp. 152-3, and she refers to stone tablets without reliefs on pp. 155 and 158. But she does not mention either type in her summary on p. 180 or in the quasi-definition given on p. 234. 5 There is a discrepancy in numbers here. Twice on p. 67, the author refers to "63" dat able artifacts listed in Appendix 1. On p. 159, she refers to "65 known datable examples" in Appendix 1. Appendix 1 actually contains 65 listings, though?for some reason never explained? it omits MDP 4 163-5 (Meli-Sipak) while including the other three artifacts argued to be members of the corpus in chapter 6. I will follow her number "65" here when referring to the corpus, though this is admittedly arbitrary. There is similar confusion with the number of artifacts classified by the subject of their inscriptions: p. 68 lists their total as "55" referring to Appendix 3, the summary list lower on p. 68 contains a total of 56 items; Appendix 3 itself (pp. 309-17) contains 57 entries (with VAS 1 35 listed twice). 6 The argumentation here is to some extent circular, since three of the four debatable members of the corpus were already included in the list of the 65 datable objects (Appen dix 1) from which the documentary typology was deduced.</page><page sequence="5">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 5 But this restriction means in effect that approximately 100 other items, which she refers to as "non-datable artifacts" and for which she does not provide an inventory,7 are generally left out of consideration, even though they are techni cally part of the genre. This streamlines the author's method of procedure, but inevitably results in distortion. Some artifacts with complete inscriptions are undated;8 and, if these do not mention a king's name or the name of a person who can be linked with a dated text, they fall out of her evidentiary base. Distortion arises, for example, when the presence of a date in the document is portrayed as part of the essential textual pattern (because only texts which are "datable" have been used to establish the pattern).9 And other features, such as the documentation of personal property other than real estate, e.g., slaves not attached to the land,10 may go unremarked. We will return to this question of the corpus later in the review. A final prefatory note. Since these artifacts appear in a variety of physical forms11 ?not only the classical stone stelae (with reliefs), but also stone plaques,12 stone tablets with reliefs, stone tablets without reliefs, and undecorated clay cones?, we will in the following pages occasionally examine explicitly whether each of these physical types exemplifies Slanski's theses enumerated above. Since the book's title promises a study in the "form and function" of the artifacts, it is important to see that different physical forms on occasion seem to signal different functions and that the various forms are not necessarily designated by the same names (e.g., nar? or kudurru) in their own inscriptions. 7 Ten are mentioned on pp. 306-7 (part of Appendix 2). But, since there has been a lack of unanimity over the years among scholars about which texts should be considered as part of the genre (p. 7), an inventory of the texts the author considers acceptable would have been helpful. This lack can, to some extent, be remedied by careful consultation of Seidl 1989, which includes many artifacts which do not bear an explicit date or lack sufficient prosopo graphical evidence to link them with datable texts. 8 E.g., BBSt 11 (c. Enlil-n?din-apli) and the Caillou Michaux (c. Marduk-n?din-ahhe). 9 Yet even here there is some inconsistency because some of the "datable" texts them selves do not contain a date or even mention a king's name (e.g., the two texts mentioned in the preceding note); so they themselves diverge from the uniform pattern. 10 BBSt 33, an "undatable" artifact mentioned by Slanski (p. 307). Note that inhabitants of villages are sometimes reckoned as part of granted estates (e.g., MDP 2 102 ii 36, Meli Sipak) and that a ninth-century grant of real estate also included a resident family of five (Thureau-Dangin 1919: 125 i 18, Marduk-z?kir-sumi I). 11 The physical types have been labelled and subdivided differently by various authors. For a concise description of the physical varieties, see Seidl 1968: 67-68; note further the obser vations by B?rker-Kl?hn 1982: 52. 12 Seidl 1968 described such objects as "plattenf?rmig" and included them under stelae. Slanski (pp. 154, 156) prefers to classify them as "plaques" and to separate them from ste lae. For the purposes of this review, to avoid confusion, I will keep the types separate; but Seidl's classification system in this respect seems to me to be preferable.</page><page sequence="6">6 JA. BRINKMAN 3. Babylonian Terms for These Artifacts The Babylonians used various words to designate artifacts in Slanski's cor pus. This is perhaps clearest in the names employed in the artifactual inscrip tions themselves to refer to the object on which they are written (hereafter termed "self-referent" usages, inscriptions, etc.). These artifacts in their classi cal form?stone stelae with reliefs?contain a variety of self-referent passages in which they describe themselves as nar?, kudurru, asumittu, or abnu. Of these, nar? ("stele," "monument," or "memorial") is the most frequently used term, kudurru (exact translation under review)13 occurs in at least four unambiguous passages, one of them overlooked by the author;14 it is also found several more times in contexts that could?but need not?be interpreted as referring to the artifact itself.15 asumittu ("inscribed slab") occurs once as a self-referent to a stele on which a text is written,16 as does the generic word abnu (simply "stone").17 Stone plaques also refer to themselves as nar?; but a clay reproduc tion made in antiquity from one of the plaques and found together with the original refers to the original plaque as an asumittu.n Stone tablets with reliefs contain no appropriate self-referent terminology. One stone tablet without reliefs has a self-referent designation; but the writing there is ambiguous and yet to be satisfactorily explained: the signs can be interpreted as either MU N?G.NA an-ni-i ("the name of this N?G.NA") or MU s? NA an-ni-i ("the name of this 13 This will be discussed further below, pp. 38-39. 14 The author deals with three passages on pp. 37-40. She implies that these occurrences of kudurru may be a strictly local usage, since the two artifacts she discusses (BBSt 3 and 4) came from the same city, i.e., Sippar (pp. 54, 60, 61, 151). But this is not the case, accord ing to research on their probable findspots done from records at the British Museum. BBSt 4 was probably excavated at Sippar (Walker and Coll?n 1980: 101) and deals with events in the province of Bit-Piri'-Amurru in northern Babylonia, while BBSt 3 was probably found at the Marduk temple in Babylon (Reade 1987: 48) and concerns property in the province of Nippur in central Babylonia. Slanski's own Appendix 3 cites these two texts as coming from Sippar and Babylon respectively (pp. 305, 307). The fourth passage is in VAS 1 58 ii 1-2 (undated) [= BE 1 150], where kudurru replaces nar? in the customary formulary dealing with possible future mistreatment of the artifact: [sa] . .. mi-is-ra in-nu-? ku-dur-ra ?-na-ka ru a-na ID i-na-du-iP "(whoever) shall change the border or remove the kudurru (and) throw (it) into a river/canal." This text was supposedly found by the nineteenth-century excavators at Nippur, though such information from the early excavations is not always reliable. 15 E.g., Caillou Michaux ii 8 (which refers to the removal or uprooting, i.e., nas?h, of "this kudurru"), similarly Hinke 1911: 26 iv 19 and al-Ad(a)mi 1982: 125 v 15; compare Rashid 1980: 144 v 1-2 (a-na re-su-ut NA4.NA.R?.A u ku-d?r-ri an-ni-i, "for the protection of this kudurru and nar?"). 16 BBSt 3 vi 26 (Meli-Sipak), written syllabically. 17 BBSt 4 iii 2 (Meli-Sipak), written NA4. 18 BBSt p. 127 BM 91002:18, written a-su-?-mi-it.</page><page sequence="7">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 7 NA").19 The two duplicate clay cones accepted by Slanski as part of her corpus have no clear self-referent designations.20 The picture is further complicated by the fact that many of the stone artifacts bear inscriptions that were copied more or less verbatim from legal documents written on clay. These texts bear headings or descriptions of themselves such as tuppultuppi "tablet/tablet of or kangulkunukku "sealed document" and mention that the documents were sealed or impressed with fingernail marks (thereby obviously referring to a clay original, not to the stone artifact itself).21 Some of these texts are marked clearly as copies (GABA.RI = gabarit) of sealed clay originals,22 but others bear no such explicit indication.23 Because of their word ing, it seems likely that texts of the latter type simply took over the terminol ogy of the clay documents without alteration; hence self-references in them to the artifact being a "tablet" or "sealed document" are presumably to the origi nal clay tablet, not to its copy on stone. Passages of this kind, which occur on all four types of stone artifacts, are excluded from consideration here. Nonetheless several clear patterns emerge from this tangle of information. First, nar? is the most commonly used self-referent for classical stone stelae with reliefs and for stone plaques. It is not as yet attested in a self-reference to any artifact among the three remaining physical types: stone tablets with reliefs, stone tablets without reliefs,24 or clay cones.25 Second, kudurru is used several times to refer to classical stone stelae with reliefs; it is not unambiguously 19 BE 1 83 rev. 21 (Enlil-n?din-apli). Slanski (pp. 42-53) prefers the reading N?G.NA and equates this with a N?G.NA that occurs twice in another kudurru, MDP 10 87-94 (Meli Sipak); this she proposes to interpret, somewhat improbably, as nignakku, "censer." Note also the puzzling NA4 na a (self referent?) on the stone slab MDP 2 95:7 (Kastiliasu IV); this perhaps defective writing could be emended to either NA4 &lt;an&gt;-na-a or NA4.NA.&lt;R?&gt;.A and so is not used in evidence here. 20 But it would be possible to interpret the statement in BBSt 1 ii 6-7 (sa kuJdur^-ra an na-a ?-na-ak-ka-ra-ma, "whoever removes this kudurru") as referring to the artifact itself. 21 The logogram NA4.KISIB (standing for kunukku), originally referring to a seal, is some times later used for a sealed tablet as well. In such cases, the NA4 has obviously lost its func tion of designating an object made of stone. 22 Al-Ad(a)mi 1982: 123 ii 21; BBSt 25:40 (both Marduk-n?din-ahhe); Reschid and Wilcke 1975: 54 i 27 (Marduk-sapik-z?ri). 23 E.g., Lambert 1981: 179 ii 19 (Marduk-n?din-ahhe); Frame 1986 207 rev. 8' (Adad apla-iddina); BBSt 28 rev. 27 (Nab?-apla-iddina). 24 Slanski (p. 228) states that the tablet-shaped artifacts of this genre were designated as nar? by the Babylonians, but this is not the case. Nar? as a self-referent occurs only in the texts on stone stelae and stone plaques. This usage distribution has ramifications for any modern genre classification terminology proposed. 25 The designation nar? sa hasbi, literally "stele of clay," is used in one of the artifactual inscriptions (MDP 2 91, premier m?daillon, line 3), but in reference to an earlier object which had been broken.</page><page sequence="8">8 JA. BRINKMAN attested as a self-reference designating objects of other physical types. Third, asumittu is used clearly twice to refer to these artifacts, once to a classical stone stele (self-reference) and once to a stone plaque, the Sippar Shamash memorial (reference in a clay copy impressed from the original). Finally, abnu is used once as a self-referent in a classical stele. So, with regard to Slanski's thesis, it may be seen?as Hinke pointed out already in 190726?that nar? is the term most commonly used for at least some artifacts of this type. It may also be con cluded that kudurru?a term used for the classical form of these artifacts by Assyriologists and historians since at least 189427?is not a "misnomer," since the Babylonians themselves employed the word in this sense.28 One may cor rectly conform to Babylonian usage by referring to these artifacts, at least in some of their physical manifestations, as nar?, kudurru, asumittu, or abnu. But none of these Babylonian terms is as yet attested for all the principal physical forms of object. It is likewise important to reflect that discussions in this book and elsewhere are imposing on these artifacts modern typology and classifications based loosely on ancient nomenclature. It is hardly clear that the Babylonians themselves would have viewed all these varied artifactual types as comprising a single genre or that they would have privileged one term over another in refer ring to individual examples. 4. The action Commemorated by the Artifact According to the author, the inscriptions on these artifacts commemorate the acquisition or affirmation of an entitlement to an ongoing source of income. As noted above, the inscriptions themselves are not legal documents and hence do not constitute or confer a title; they merely attempt to present in more durable form the memory of a legal action. Over the years, the legal actions address a range of matters of financial interest, principally titles to real estate, revenue 26 Hinke 1907: 2 n. 1; see also Steinmetzer 1922: 100; Brinkman 1981: 270. 27 Belser 1894 ("Babylonische Kudurru-Inschriften"). Note Flemming's characterization eleven years earlier of one meaning of kudurru as "Grenzpfahl" (Flemming 1883: 23), with citations of previous bibliography. Jastrow (1888: xcv-xcviii) suggested that the word "kud?ru," in addition to its uses as "circle" and "boundary," also referred to the ring in the Sun-god's hand on the Samas Sippar artifact (BBSt 36, Nab?-apla-iddina); but he did not call the arti fact itself a "kud?ru." 28 Most strikingly in the opening sentence of BBSt 4: "The name of this kudurru is 'O Adad, heroic lord, grant me a canal of plenty'" (sum kudurrfi] annt Adad b?lu qardu patti nuhsi surka). But the word also occurs?in contexts usually occupied by nar??in contin gency clauses referring to possible future mistreatment of the artifact (BBSt 3 v 39, VAS 1 58 ii 1) and in the phrase "all gods whose name(s) are invoked on this kudurru" (BBSt 3 vi 21-22).</page><page sequence="9">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 9 from temple offices, tax exemptions, and ownership of personal property. Whe ther each of these may appropriately be categorized as an "ongoing source of income" is debatable.29 Assigned revenue from temple offices is clearly congru ent with such a description. Real estate and personal property, however, though they can produce income, are not necessarily structured to do so on a regular basis. Tax exemptions lighten financial or other burdens, but grouping them with sources of income does not seem particularly appropriate. And the term "entitlement" itself is perhaps not the most felicitous choice for this generic classification. At least in modern American parlance, the term has come to be more commonly used in the context of institutional programs, especially of the government, which provide guaranteed financial benefits (e.g., social security and medicare); and entitlement is clearly not used in that sense here. Here, except in the case of prebends, the concern is with legal "title" (to real prop erty or the like), not with a guaranteed stream of revenue. It is also worth observing that some of the early artifacts of the genre do not seem primarily to commemorate an event, such as the acquisition or affirmation of a financial title. They focus explicitly on the description of the land granted, with the act of bestowal relegated to a relative clause, for example: "60 (kurru), of agricultural land, measured at the rate of 3 sutu to the ik? according to the great cubit, on the bank of the Euphrates . . . which Kurigalzu . .. gave to Enlil-bani. . . and (for which) Kadasman-Enlil confirmed the boundary from X to Y."30 While one does not wish to overemphasize what may be a purely syntactic or stylistic feature, it seems that such texts call attention to and cele brate the property (through foregrounding)?not the event of conferral or acqui sition (which is left in the background). This may merit further study or analysis, especially from a linguistic or institutional perspective.31 Other artifacts commemorate disparate acquisitions by a single individual, with the emphasis on personal accumulation of property or temple income. VAS 1 70 (Sargon II), for example, records six transactions spread over four teen years by which Nab?-l?'i acquired various real properties. VAS 1 35 (Marduk-z?kir-sumi I) describes how Kidinnu was given real estate and prebend 29 The author herself sometimes makes this distinction by referring to property or other items as "a source of potential income" (p. 114). 30 BBSt 1 with its duplicate BM 135743 (Kadasman-Enlil). Slanski edits the two texts on pp. 183-90. The following comments may be made on her edition of BM 135743 (text B). More likely i 1 begins 1 rSU\ i 2 probably begins ana rK?S? GAL?1, i 3: only MAR.TU is assured, ii 1-2 lists the boundaries of the territory affected (istu X adi Y) with neither geo graphical name sufficiently preserved. 31 I am grateful to Christopher Woods for discussing with me the circumstances of such usage and the terminology involved here.</page><page sequence="10">10 J.A. BRINKMAN rights by his father and then, approximately fifteen years later, purchased addi tional land. In such texts, the unifying focus is on the individual owner and his property, in a sense providing an inventory of assets and the basis for the under lying legal titles.32 5. An Appropriate Modern Name for the Genre If one is willing to accept the author's broad understanding of "entitlement" in the sense of "title" and further extend the meaning to cover such diverse mat ters as tax exemptions, one can agree that "entitlement nar?" would be a pos sible designation for at least some of these artifacts. But, since the Babylonians themselves on occasion clearly used the word kudurru in a similar sense, modern scholars can hardly be faulted if they choose to continue using the tra ditional terminology. This is a question of preference. One could also avoid Babylonian terms altogether and refer to members of the genre as "memori als/monuments of financial interest"; but this does not seem particularly dis tinctive or enlightening. A further word of caution, nar? itself is a generic term with a wide range of meanings, beginning with its original sense of "erected stele" (at first only of stone). In time, its usage spread from stone stelae and monuments (often royal) to inscribed memorials made of other materials (silver, gold, copper, bronze, lapis lazuli, alabaster, clay, etc.).33 The term also has been and is still widely employed to designate specific text types, e.g., nar? literature for literary-his torical compositions, official royal inscriptions, and similar texts.34 In selecting appropriate terminology for the genre under consideration here, one should not disregard these broader and better-known contexts of both ancient and modern usage and should take care to guard against potential confusion. 6. Uniform Structure of the Inscriptions Slanski concludes from her study that inscriptions on these artifacts share the same basic structure, which can be outlined with four major sectional headings and thirteen constituent elements:35 32 A somewhat similar focus on various properties and exemptions severally conferred on the princess Hunnubat-Nanaya may be seen in MDP 10 87-94 (Meli-Sipak); most if not all of these benefits were bestowed by her father, the king. 33 CAD N/l (1980) 364-7. A useful historical survey is provided in Pongratz-Leisten 1999. 34 G?terbock 1934: 19-22; Pongratz-Leisten 1999. 35 P. 101; a similar list, with slightly different groupings and phraseology, appears on p. 167.</page><page sequence="11">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 11 A.

The author indicates that the only significant exceptions to this structure are five records of purchase inscribed on tablet-shaped stones: these inscriptions do not contain curses (element 10 above). Otherwise she notes only minor variations to the pattern, occasioned mostly by circumstances specific to the transaction recorded, by the physical shape of the artifact, or by diachronic developments within the corpus. Slanski lays great emphasis on this structural pattern, referring to "the com pelling uniformity of the inscriptions" (p. 105) and the "same over-riding struc ture" shared by the inscription of each artifact (p. 288).37 She invokes this as a principal argument for including some "debatable members" in her corpus of artifacts (chapter 6). This pattern then merits closer examination. In the follow ing paragraphs, I will survey several aspects of the proposed structure?some of which indeed show significant variation over time. When one examines patterns of occurrence of Slanski's thirteen constituent elements of basic structure, one is struck by the relative rarity and narrow 36 Or, perhaps more accurately, contingency clause(s): a statement of a possible future occurrence or occurrences for which a curse?or, much more rarely, a blessing?is invoked. The genre contains relatively few real prohibitions as such. 37 Some of her discussions especially in chapter 3 (pp. 65-104) take a less categorical view of the content of individual inscriptions.</page><page sequence="12">12 J.A. BRINKMAN chronological limits of some of these elements across her corpus of 65 datable inscriptions. For instance, only 10 of these artifacts?i.e., 15% of the corpus? are attested with proper names of their own; four texts have a name only at the beginning (element 1), five only at the end (element 13), and only one text of the corpus has elements 1 and 13 together. Yet the occurrence of both these ele ments is listed as part of the basic structure, even with only a single attested co-occurrence! In addition, over the seven-century range of Slanski's corpus, such names are attested for less than 240 years (1307-1069 at the outside). Similarly with statements of surveying (element 5): these are attested in less than 25% of the inscriptions and occur only in texts dating between the reigns of Meli-Sipak and Marduk-ahh?-er?ba, i.e., 1186-1046, covering less than a cen tury and a half of the long period.38 Narratives (element 2) and paeans (element 3) are also relatively uncommon, occurring in less than 30% and less than 15% of the corpus respectively; but they are spread over a greater chronological range than some of the other features. Perhaps more tellingly, one can readily find examples of complete inscrip tions that have fewer than half of these thirteen elements. BBSt 1 and its dupli cate (Kurigalzu) and BE 1 149 (Marduk-ahh?-er?ba) have only five elements each (nos. 4-6, 9-10); MDP 2 86-92 (Nazi-Maruttas) in its original state had the same five elements, to which a colophon (no. 12) was added when the text was recopied over a century later. The Caillou Michaux (c. Marduk-n?din-ahhe) has only four elements (nos. 4, 6, 9-10);39 and AfO 23 1-11 (Marduk-apla-iddina I) probably has only these elements as well.40 If complete or nearly complete inscriptions can freely omit eight or nine of the thirteen elements that are sup posed to be part of the uniform basic structure, one can only conclude that the analysis leaves something to be desired. In fact, the text structure of these artifacts is widely variable. For instance, inscriptions modelled on clay legal texts usually have a precise date (at least month and regnal year), witnesses, and some mention of sealing. But this inscriptional pattern among the artifacts develops only slowly: with the excep tion of a text dated to 1303 (Nazi-Maruttas year 5), which contains witnesses, 38 At least one probable earlier occurrence could be adduced if Slanski's corpus were expanded according to suggestions made below (pp. 24-6). 39 Note, however, that this text?in the place normally reserved for mention of a sealing? inserts a statement that the donor swore an oath by the gods on the artifact (ana paqri la rase n?s ill rab?ti u Nirah ina nar? su?tu izkur, i 20-22). Slanski fails to note this significant difference in custom, as well as in the documentary pattern. 40 Though the clause in i 8-17 still needs to be satisfactorily interpreted, it seems to be part of the main event as well. Should this prove otherwise, it would nonetheless add only a single additional element.</page><page sequence="13">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 13 mention of sealing, and a date,41 witnesses otherwise begin to appear only in the early twelfth century in the reign of Meli-Sipak and dates are attested only from the Isin II dynasty on (earliest attestation slightly after 1140). Thereafter, this type of text is attested until the end of the genre. On the other hand, many artifactual inscriptions are not based on clay legal texts. These list no witnesses or date; and this type of text flourishes especially under the Kassite dynasty (attested from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-twelfth century) and continues under the Isin II dynasty until at least 1046.42 In fact, this list of thirteen elements could more accurately be said to repre sent a possible maximum repertoire of features that occur across the range of Slanski's corpus. To compose individual artifactual inscriptions, scribes select from among these features in various combinations according to the require ments of the particular situation. Most members of the corpus, at least before the eighth century (toward the end of the genre's chronological range), have nine elements of this listing or often fewer.43 Thus it is misleading to speak of a uniform pattern followed by these inscriptions, and it is better to characterize these features as a limited range of compositional elements in use by the scribes.44 7. Permanency of the Legal Action, Heritability of Financial Interests The legal actions described in these texts were designed to have permanent effect. Transfers of title or grants of income, at least those recorded on these 41 This text (IM 49991) is not mentioned by Slanski on p. 102, where she states that the earliest accounts of sealing and witnesses appear in the time of Meli-Sipak (1186-1172). But on p. 175 she points out that a list of personal names occurs in this Nazi-Maruttas text and that "the best explanation for these names would be that they constitute the earliest attested witness list." The case is much clearer than that. From the published photographs (Iraq, Supplement 1944, fig. 21; Seidl 1989: pi. la), one can easily distinguish the names of two men (each preceded by IGI, marking them as witnesses) and their patronyms. The names are followed by the phrase kangu kanik: "the document was sealed," the date, and the name and title of the scribe. 42 The relationship between genre documents and legal texts will be further discussed in the excursus at the end of this article. 43 No text contains all 13 elements or even 12 of them. Only four texts, i.e. about 6% of the datable corpus, have 10 or more elements (the maximum being 11). Does the number of features tend imperceptibly to grow over time? Or is this because some features of the reper toire are derived from legal texts and more of the later inscriptions seem to share this type of characteristic? 44 One obtains similar results if one calculates only in terms of the four major sections (A-D) of the pattern. Sections A and D are lacking in many artifacts.</page><page sequence="14">14 JA. BRINKMAN artifacts, were not considered to be transitory or temporary;45 and the property, income, and tax exemptions were also seen as heritable.46 Injunctions against the claims of false heirs are attested as early as the end of the fourteenth century,47 and explicit statements that the legal action had lasting effect (ana urn s?ti) are found from the early twelfth century on.48 Adjudications of con tested claims among putative heirs are sometimes recorded at length in these documents. Though almost all these transactions were to the direct benefit of a single person and reasons behind gifts or awards are sometimes explicitly stated, W.G. Lambert (1981: 180) called attention to two artifacts whose inscriptions hint at institutional practices underlying the granting of land holdings, at least under the Isin II dynasty. He pointed out that, in these cases, specific parcels of agricultural land were successively held by unrelated persons exercising the same office or occupation and that the land was transferred by royal interven tion rather than by a traditional pattern of inheritance. In one instance, a sa b?b ekalli (a title perhaps originally referring to a palace gatekeeper?) was removed from office for misconduct; and his land was then handed over to another sa b?b ekalli.49 In the other instance, the land-holding of a craftsman who made leather armor (ask?p siriam) was temporarily taken over by another craftsman with the same title; and the king intervened to restore the land to the first crafts man.50 These cases, though isolated, at least suggest that some land plots were assigned to individuals on the basis of services they were expected to render to the crown.51 Whether such practices were more widespread than we are cur rently able to detect must remain undecided. 45 Except perhaps for the land granted to the daughter of Arad-Sibitti by her father in BBSt 9 i 1-17 (I am indebted to John Nielsen for this analysis). The text then states that this same land was granted once more twenty years later by Mar-biti-suma-ibni (i 18-29), this time in perpetuity (ana um s?ti). Was this land held in common, since on each occasion the grant was made in a location described as "the city of his (var.: my) brothers" (ill, 22) and the brothers are specified by name? 46 This can be seen from the numerous contingency clauses looking to an indefinite future (ana ark?t ?me) and aimed at officials or heirs of previous owners of a property who might presume to impugn the legal title or to act prejudiciously against either the property/exemp tions or the memorial of their legal conferral. 47 In two artifacts from the reign of Nazi-Maruttas, IM 49991 (Iraq, supplement 1944, fig. 21) and L. 7072 (Arnaud 1972: 164-9). 48 E.g., BBSt 3 v 26; cf. an ahmt ?ml MDP 10 88 i 18 (both texts from the reign of Meli Sipak). 49 Reschid and Wilcke 1975: 54. 50 Lambert 1981: 178. 51 The same is undoubtedly true in this period for many grants to temple personnel, which were made to them in virtue of their office and would be handed down to their successors (not necessarily the grantee's biological or legal heirs).</page><page sequence="15">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 15 8. Placement and Purpose of the Artifacts The fashioning of these artifacts seems generally to have been commissioned by the persons who benefited from the legal act (or acts) commemorated on them.52 The legal event may not always have taken place in the same town where the artifact was made or displayed.53 The proceedings were sometimes witnessed by a small college of traveling central officials rather than by local inhabitants who would have been personally familiar with the property in ques tion.54 There may also on occasion have been a significant lapse of time between the legal act and the fashioning of the artifact; this may be seen, for example, from BBSt 30 (Itti-Marduk-bal?tu) where the month name on the clay original had broken away before the stone copy was made.55 Direct evidence, both textual and archeological, for the original placement of these artifacts is relatively scarce. The best textual evidence comes from two early-twelfth-century texts (one a copy of an earlier document) that indicate that the artifacts in question were placed before a god, presumably in a temple.56 One apparently dissenting piece of evidence, not mentioned by Slanski, is on an artifact whose date is not preserved, but which has a passage referring to a "stele which is set up on that field" (Scheil: "na-ra-a sa i-na eqli sa-su sa-ak (nu)";57 this requires further verification.58 Scientific archeological evidence for 52 Were there possible exceptions when the donor and recipient were members of the same family, e.g., when Meli-Sipak gave lands to his son and daughter? 53 For example, the Sippar Samas plaque (BBSt 36) was based on a legal document drawn up in Babylon, as was the gift of land, income, and other items at Uruk presented to the multi-beneficed scribe of the Eanna temple (Thureau-Dangin 1919). Was it pure coincidence that both these documents were drawn up in the capital on the twentieth day of Nisan in the month of the New Year's Festival, though several years apart? 54 There was a committee of seven such officials, headed by the governor of Isin, who witnessed legal actions recorded in these texts at various locations in Babylonia between 1100 and 850. The seven officials are always listed in the same order. (Brinkman 1968: 301 3; two new documents have since been published which show the same grouping of officials: Reschid and Wilcke 1975: 54 i 18-25 and al-Ad(a)mi 1982: 123 ii 6-17). 55 Reading ITI he-pi in BBSt 30 rev. 24 (collation).

Note a similar gap in time postulated between the two uses of the stone on which BBSt 9 is engraved (Seidl 1989: 44-5 no. 74 and 54-5 no. 74'). 56 MDP 10 89 ii 13-15 (Meli-Sipak); MDP 2 91 premier m?daillon, line 5 (Meli-Sipak; colophon to the copy of an earlier text). The other two passages cited by Slanski on pp. 56-7 involve a mistranslation (BBSt 11, explained below on pp. 32-3) and a heavily broken passage where the reference is uncertain (Arnaud 1972, text of Nazi-Maruttas). 57 MDP 6 45 v 9'-10'. This passage has been noted in the literature (e.g., Steinmetzer 1922: 101, Brinkman 1981: 270). 58 The text has not been published in copy; nor has a photograph of the pertinent section of the inscription been made available.</page><page sequence="16">16 JA. BRINKMAN where these artifacts were positioned within temples is negligible; though a sub stantial number of them were excavated in sacred precincts, these were gener ally found in later levels and perhaps in secondary context.59 The other exca vated artifacts were found either unfinished in a contemporary workshop in a private house, in clearly secondary context in later levels (sometimes in or near temples), in excavations that were haphazardly recorded by modern standards, or as booty taken to Assyria or Elam.60 Thus while current evidence?as has been pointed out in earlier studies61?favors temples as the original location of these artifacts, we should still like to know where and in what manner within a temple such objects were positioned. For this we need better archeological context or more explicit textual evidence. Why were artifacts of this type put in temples? If they were erected in the presence of a god, they were presumably being placed under the god's protec tion. In textual references on the artifacts themselves, divine protection is fre quently invoked by pleas to "all the gods whose names/images are recorded on this memorial" (and similar phrases). This protection is requested both for the financial interests (the subject of the legal action recorded) and for the object itself (the memorial of the legal action). Invocation of the divine is one of the principal stated motivations behind the creation of these artifacts: to secure last ing supernatural favor for the person who has the artifact made as well as for his heirs in respect to their real or personal property, tax exemptions, or temple emoluments. Fears of the owner or exempt?e regarding potential future ill treat ment of the memorial itself are often spelled out in concrete detail: e.g., removal or defacing of the artifact, its reuse by someone else, its destruction by fire, its immersion in water, its hiding in a place where it could not be seen, and so forth. Such descriptions seem to postulate that the artifacts would gen erally be placed on display and that there were many real threats to their effec tive survival as memorials.62 The number of artifacts of this type that have been found rubbed down and reused is a testimony both to the value of these stones 59 Seidl 1989: 72-3, 221-9. By later levels here, I include instances in which these arti facts were found together with objects dating from a later time. This would hardly be sur prising, if these artifacts were designed for permanent display and so continued in use over several generations. 60 Seidl 1989: 69-73, 221-9. 61 E.g., Seidl 1968: 72-3, Brinkman 1981: 270; cf. Scheil 1900: 104 n. 1 and Thureau Dangin 1919: 119. 62 Though if these artifacts were made for display, the question arises why, in the case of BBSt 1 and BM 135743 (Slanski, pp. 183-90), which were found together at Sippar, it would have been deemed advisable to make two copies of the same text. Was more than one put on display? Was one placed in storage as a back-up, in case the display object disappeared or was broken?</page><page sequence="17">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 17 even as raw material and to the probability that the fears of the memorials' owners as to their future inviolability were not groundless.63 Christopher Woods has recently published a detailed study of the Sippar Shamash artifact, reconstructing the circumstances under which it was excavated in 1881, reediting its inscription and those on the accompanying objects, analyzing the iconography of its relief, and placing the whole ancient deposit in Mesopo tamian cultural context.64 He points out that the four objects now in the British Museum?the Shamash artifact itself (BM 91000), the coffer in which it was found (BM 91004), and the two clay reproductions of the relief (BM 91001, 91002)65?were probably not the only items found in the same locus by Rassam's workmen. There was at least one more clay reproduction, currently in the Istanbul Arkeoloji M?zeleri, which was clearly not made from the main arti fact since it shows a slightly different placing of the caption within the Shamash shrine on the relief as well as an orthographic variant in its legend.66 It has sometimes been posited that there may have been a second principal artifact as well, from which the Istanbul reproduction was made.67 Woods points out that the main artifact (BM 91000) was repaired in antiquity, and he makes a con vincing case that the coffer and its contents were reburied in the time of Nabonidus when the Shamash temple was rebuilt. This circumstance in turn suggests that the main artifact itself may originally have been buried for safe keeping and as a record for posterity68?rather than put on display?in the time of Nab?-apla-iddina. Charpin (2002: 190) arrives at a somewhat similar con clusion, though from a different perspective on the evidence.69 It should be noted 63 E.g., Seidl 1989: nos. 43, 60, 74, 87, 102; see also Slanski, p. 62 n. 3 and p. 286 n. 12. Elamite plunderers were not the only persons who removed texts from these stones. 64 Woods 2004. Earlier literature includes an extensive treatment by Slanski in the volume under review on pp. 196-221, incorporating a transliteration and translation of the full text, a discussion of its meaning, and an interpretation of the iconography. Seidl (2001: 121-31) gives a more nuanced analysis of the iconography. Charpin (2002: 189-90) presents a detailed study of the provenance and use of the artifact, as well as the coflFer and two clay impres sions found with it; his conclusions will be mentioned below. 65 BM 91002 has an independent inscription on the back, probably not written in the time of Nab?-apla-iddina (Woods 2004: 34-9, 101). The poor quality of most of these reproduc tions was noted by Jastrow (1898-99: 85); see also Woods 2004: 38. 66 Woods 2004: 28-30. 67 Woods 2004: 30-31, 39. It is uncertain whether the second principal artifact?if it existed?would have been a duplicate of the Nab?-apla-iddina stone or a similarly structured inscription of the later restorer of the temple, though the latter alternative seems more likely (see Woods 2004: 39). 68 As a foundation deposit and/or in case of possible future disruptions to the Shamash cult or another disappearance of the image in unsettled times, such as are sketched in the preamble to the inscription. See further the remarks of Woods 2004: 35. 69 He proposes that all four objects currently in the British Museum were placed together</page><page sequence="18">18 JA. BRINKMAN that in this text the future contingency clauses preceding the curses refer only to the possibility of someone destroying the stele, not to someone burying it or hiding it from view, in contrast to some other texts of this genre where the clear implication is that the object was meant for display. In this case, despite some uncertainties in the reconstruction, one may well have to reckon with an origi nal purpose for the principal artifact other than public exhibition.70 Thus there is no archeological evidence that these artifacts were used as boundary markers, and the single piece of textual evidence for placement on a field requires further confirmation. On the other hand, as has been recognized in earlier studies, these objects were more likely installed in temples, though we do not as yet know how or where they may have been displayed in the sacred precincts. 9. Relief Sculptures and the Monumentality of the Artifacts Sculpture on these artifacts depicts symbols of the gods, cultic scenes, and secular views, including portrayals of kings, officials, and private persons. These artistic embellishments are attested on three of the five physical forms men tioned above; tablets without reliefs and the few known clay objects bear no such decorations. These symbols and representations have been comprehen sively studied by Seidl,71 and nothing of significance has been added to her treatment.72 Slanski stresses that these artifacts should be categorized as monuments rather than as legal documents. The objects are clearly not legal documents, since they could not be sealed; however, some of the texts on these objects are copies of legal documents and can profitably be analyzed as such and compared with similar texts. But the primary purpose of the artifacts is to perpetuate the memory of the transactions that they represent, and thus they are indeed more properly classified as memorials or monuments.73 already in the time of Nab?-apla-iddina and buried to preserve a protected record of the appearance of the Shamash cult statue. 70 In some respects, this agrees with the original interpretation of King 1912: 120 n. 1, though he was reading the name on the impression as Nabopolassar rather than Nab?-apla iddina and placing the burial two centuries after the latter's reign. Note that this burial of a commemorative nar? in a box within a temple affords an interesting parallel to the practice mentioned in an Old Babylonian literary text, the "Cuthean Legend," where a nar? is said to have been kept in a chest serving as a treasure repository among the temple furniture (Westenholz 1993: 213). 71 Seidl 1968, 1989. 72 Note however the reservations of B?rker-Kl?hn (1982: 51-2) on the validity of some of the stylistic groupings proposed by Seidl, which often overlap chronologically. 73 As has been noted earlier, e.g., Brinkman 1981: 269-70.</page><page sequence="19">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 19 Jutta B?rker-Kl?hn, in her detailed study of the sculptured stelae of ancient Western Asia, surveyed a broad range of material and concluded that an essen tial distinction should be made between stelae proper and the artifacts under consideration here. For these artifacts, she pointed out such characteristics as the irregular shape of the stones, the poor quality of the relief carving, the haphaz ard arrangement of the designs, and the stones' small size and argued that these qualities underscored the lack of relationship between the two groups. She fur ther judged that these artifacts are totally lacking in monumentality.74 Slanski, in her brief survey of nar? monuments in early Mesopotamia (pp. 240-5), dis agrees with B?rker-Kl?hn's analysis and comments on the deliberate shaping? or at least remodelling?of some raw materials to produce the artifacts, the highly polished surfaces of most of these objects, and their selection of decora tive symbols and other subjects that she believes would have "generated... a positive aesthetic response when viewed by their audience" (p. 245). In any case, she concludes, regardless of what qualities would have constituted "mon umentality" in an ancient Mesopotamian setting, these artifacts "belong, by ancient Mesopotamian definition, to the typology of monuments" because they are members of a category designated as nar?/na-ru-a, which is to be translated "(stone) monument." (p. 245) Thus the arguments for or against the monumentality of these objects turn on differing modern aesthetic appraisals of the corpus and its placement within the tradition of Mesopotamian relief sculpture on the one hand and on the empha sis of a philological link by means of the term nar? or na-ru-a, which can be translated as "(stone) monument," on the other. The modern appraisals involve judgments of taste, which are inevitably conditioned by present-day Western culture and cannot with confidence be represented as reflecting ancient Meso potamian perspectives. The philological connection also offers no iron-clad argu ment. Not all pre-Middle-BabyIonian stone stelae are labeled nar?; and "nar?" was also used in the Old Babylonian period to designate less monumental objects made of clay (IM na-r?-a)75 or copper (URUDU na-r?-a).76 In addition, Alster published a Neo-BabyIonian text said in its colophon to be derived from an Old Babylonian incantation carved on a diorite nar?, which does not seem to have been a royal monument.77 As we have noted above, literary-historical 74 B?rker-Kl?hn 1982: 51-2. Note her statement "Was Kudurru grunds?tzlich von Stelen unterscheidet, ist der absolute Mangel an innerer und ?usserer Monumentalit?t" (ibid., p. 51). 75 RIME 4 p. 379 E4.3.7.4 ii 10'. 76 Mentioned in the name for Rim-Sin I year 5 (Sigrist 1990: 38-9); see also Ludwig 1990: 62 IsD Za 5 (Isme-Dagan hymn). 77 ki-i KA IM.G?D.DA GABA.RI NA4.NA.R?.A NA4.G?R.TAB (Alster 1972: 350 line</page><page sequence="20">20 JA. BRINKMAN texts were also referred to as nar?s. Thus the word nar? developed a more nuanced meaning than simply "(stone) monument," and this wider usage must inevitably inform our philological perspective.78 Furthermore, not all physical forms of our artifacts are explicitly designated as nar?s: only the classical decorated stone stelae and plaques are so named. Hence the result of the investigation in regard to monumentality (here our modern label) must be regarded as incon clusive and subject to further study. Nonetheless, as has been recognized previ ously,79 these artifacts are not themselves legal documents and should more properly be categorized as objects made either for display or as memorials. 10. Broader Implications for Babylonian Political and Social History The author concludes her survey of the early nar? or monumental tradition down through the Old Babylonian period with special emphasis on three royal representatives of the genre: the Stele of the Vultures, the Ur-Namma Stele, and the best-preserved of the Hammurabi law stelae. She then argues that the appearance of "entitlement nar?s" in the Kassite period represents the appropri ation by private persons of what had previously been a royal prerogative, namely the commissioning of nar? monuments. She asserts that this appropria tion, plus the dearth of royal monumental stelae over the next several centuries, reflects a period of weakness of central political authority in Babylonia. She adduces supporting evidence in coeval texts that mention limitations on royal power: a statement about the rights of the citizenry in an artifactual inscription and sim ilar privileges described in the literary composition "Advice to a Prince." Finally she places these developments in wider historical perspective: the inno vations embodied in this genre of artifacts should be contextualized among con temporary "signs of broader social changes taking place in Babylonia and throughout the ancient Near East." (p. 281) 22). For other comments on Old Babylonian nar?s which might not fit into the category of monuments, see Westenholz 1993: 213-4. Pongratz-Leisten 1999: 79. 78 It is unfortunate that the author did not delve more deeply into the use of the word nar? / na-r?-a in the Old Babylonian period and earlier, since this could have helped to pre sent a more critical view of the term's history to parallel the aesthetic analysis of some steles of this time. A more developed philological as well as archeological perspective for these earlier periods would have provided a more revealing background for the author's later attempts to interpret the origin of these artifacts in the early Middle Babylonian period as a private intrusion into what had formerly been exclusively royal territory. 79 E.g., Brinkman 1981: 269-70; Steinmetzer 1922: 111 made the same point about these texts not being legal documents.</page><page sequence="21">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 21 We shall begin by examining the texts cited to illustrate limitations on royal power. The first of these is an artifactual inscription dating from the time of Meli-Sipak (1186-1172), recording the king's gift of land to his son and heir, Marduk-apla-iddina (MDP 2 99-111). The king grants to the new owner of this land and to his successors generous tax exemptions, which are described in detail. These exemptions are not "an extraordinary statement about the rights of the citizenry" (p. 280), but an illustration of the power of a monarch to release one of his subjects (and that subject's heirs) from normal tax obligations and to specify?or at least express a hope?that no future king would reverse these exemp tions. If these injunctions were in fact observed, the pronouncement would reflect the comparative strength of a king, not his weakness; and this is a specific adjustment intended for one person, not a general statement of rights for a class of people. The second text is the "Advice to a Prince" (F?rsten spiegel), composed perhaps sometime in the early first millennium B.C., cer tainly no later than c. 735, when its earlier copy is known. It is a literary piece, warning a monarch not to transgress against rights of citizens of the cult cen ters Sippar, Nippur, and Babylon. Whether this admonition was intended for a specific monarch or whether all the enumerated rights actually existed outside this literary appeal has been debated. It is possible to interpret the text as a latter-day attempt to provide an enumeration of rights?some of which may be spurious?which benefit the financial interests of a privileged minority.80 In any case, its relevance either to the history of the later second millennium B.C. or to actual decentralization of political power is hardly clear.81 It is also worth observing that the present lack of known royal monumental stelae in the Kassite period may be due more to the accidents of archeological discovery than to the diminution of royal power. Besides the artifacts under consideration here, there are private stelae known from the period.82 Many other inscribed stone objects such as door sockets, tablets, vases, and knobs are attested at this time, as are inscriptions on semi-precious stone (e.g., seals, disks, amulets, and beads, made of material such as lapis lazuli, agate, and car nelian).83 There is also evidence for stone statuary of Kurigalzu (presumably I), 80 See most recently the remarks of Biggs 2004, which also provides extensive bibliogra phy. It may be questioned whether a literary text of this type may appropriately be described as a "forgery." 81 It is known that the citizens of at least some Babylonian cities enjoyed privileges and exemptions in the first millennium, but the source and extent of such favors require further clarification. 82 E.g., those of Assal-Ban from Uruk in the time of Nazi-Maruttas. 83 Brinkman 1976: 72 n. 290.</page><page sequence="22">22 J.A. BRINKMAN though it is known at present only in surviving fragments.84 Architectural mas terworks such as Kara-indas's temple of Istar at Uruk decorated with reliefs in the form of sculpted bricks are also in evidence, as are palace wall paintings from D?r-Kurigalzu. So, regardless of the present distribution of known (royal) stelae, the Kassite period is not devoid of distinctive stone work or art; and pre sent lack of attestation of examples in a particular artistic category need not be viewed as having broader political, economic, or social significance.85 In support of her conclusions about the declining power of the Babylonian monarchy and its exemplification of broader social changes taking place across the ancient Near East, Slanski refers to an article by Liverani (1984) setting up interpretive models for land tenure and inheritance patterns (pp. 282-4). This succinct presentation, published without documentation, obviously relied in part on Liverani's prior studies on the society and economy of Ugarit in the late sec ond millennium; it focused on the interaction between those divisions of soci ety which he termed the "palace" and "family" sectors. Both Liverani and Slanski opine that royal land grants and tax exemptions represent a weakening of the palace's position by strengthening the independent financial status of the private or family sector. It is difficult to reconcile this model with what is known of the history of Babylonia during the Kassite period. Babylonia was the seat of one of the Great Kings,86 i.e., a major power, in the ancient Near East during the Amarna Age (fifteenth to mid-fourteenth centuries B.C.),87 was powerful enough to wage wars against Elam and Assyria from the fourteenth to the early twelfth cen turies, maintained diplomatic relations with the Hittites well into the thirteenth century,88 and?judging from evidence of the abundant administrative records at Nippur dating from c. 1360 to 1225 B.C.?managed a highly profitable econ omy based at least in part on powerful centralized institutions. Royal grants of 84 For references, see Brinkman 1976: 209-11 Q.2.2-Q.2.4. 85 It is probably better to temper one's enthusiasm for drawing conclusions from the numerical incidence or scarcity of objects such as tablets or stelae of a particular date. Having succumbed to temptations of this sort myself, in a search for often sparse evidence to evaluate long- and short-term trends (in the name of the longue dur?e), I recognize its per ils and sometimes misleading results, often dependent on non-representative happenstance of finds. 86 I.e., a land whose ruler was entitled to be called sarru rab?, "great king." 87 Though this international age is usually referred to as the Amarna age because the bulk of the pertinent diplomatic court correspondence was found at Amarna, the period was actu ally ushered in while Dynasty XVIII of Egypt still had its capital in Thebes. Kara-indas (c. 1413) is the earliest Babylonian ruler mentioned as taking part in these international diplo matic exchanges. 88 E.g., KBo 1 10.</page><page sequence="23">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 23 land and of tax exemptions do not appear as a regular undertaking within the state apparatus, but seem to have been bestowed individually and in exceptional circumstances.89 These grants seem more likely to illustrate the power of the monarch to dispose of lands and revenue as he saw fit. An essential part of the same Liverani model, which Slanski omits from her discussion, is his charac terization of the years 1500-1000 as a time marked by the "end of automatic inheritance" and the years 1000-500 as engendering "access to land based on merit. . . instead of birth right."90 Such trends enshrined in his model are contra indicated by Slanski's conclusions from the artifacts under consideration, which evidence a strong continuing pattern of family inheritance of land and other property rights.91 Thus the Liverani and Slanski models do not seem to mesh well with the available Babylonian data (nor always with each other).92 Finally, should the innovation represented by these artifacts in Kassite Babylonia be viewed as an appropriation of royal privilege by private persons? This is a complex question to answer, and it is not facilitated by the author's emphasis on three earlier examples of royal monumental stelae in stone?the Stele of the Vultures, the Ur-Namma Stele, and the Hammurabi Law Stele. These three are magnificent pieces, notable for their size and artistic merit and also, as indicated above, not necessarily representative even for Old Babylonian (and earlier?) nar?s, some of which were hardly monumental. By contrast, the six earliest known Kassite artifacts of our genre93 (down through the time of Nazi-Maruttas, 1307-1282) are much smaller?the tallest of them is 59 cm high, as opposed to the 225 cm of the Hammurabi Stele.94 Three of the six, including the two oldest, were made of clay.95 If the genre developed from pieces similar 89 See most recently the observations in this respect by Sommerfeld 1995: 481-8. 90 Liverani 1984: 40-3. 91 E.g., pp. 115-6, 143, 180. 92 Yet one should not view the status of the Babylonian monarch over the period repre sented by these artifacts (from at least the fourteenth to the seventh century) as essentially unchanging. Within these centuries, several sub-periods can be distinguished; and the power of the central government was clearly at times much weaker, e.g., during most of the tenth century and especially for the period from about 812 to 780. 93 I here count the two duplicates (BBSt 1 and BM 135743) as a single example, but include UM 55-21-62 (Sassmannshausen 1994) in the tally, as explained below in the fol lowing section. 94 The dimensions are not altogether comparable, since the Kassite period artifacts are usu ally not fully preserved. The surviving height of the tallest kudurru/nar? of the period is 91 cm or 3 feet (BBSt 5). But the dimensions of the width also show the Kassite memorials are on a smaller scale. 95 For one of these inscriptions, we possess only a later stone copy, but the colophon to the copy states that the original text from the time of Nazi-Maruttas (1307-1282) was on a clay nar? (na-ra-a sa ha-as-bi, MDP 2 91, premier m?daillon, line 3).</page><page sequence="24">24 J.A. BRINKMAN to the surviving clay forerunners, which are small cones or prisms without decoration,96 it is difficult to see how contemporary Babylonians would have perceived the private commissioning of such undistinguished objects as an arro gation of royal privilege. 11. The Corpus Reconsidered Chapter 6, "Debatable Members of the Corpus" (pp. 183-232), presents detailed arguments why five datable artifacts?two of which contain duplicate texts?should be considered members of this genre. All but one of these arti facts were already included among the 65 datable objects from which the pro posed textual pattern of the inscriptions was derived.97 A further problem arises at this point. As mentioned earlier, though the author gives a detailed catalogue in Appendix 1 of what she considers datable artifacts of this type, she nowhere gives a comprehensive list of the undatable artifacts that she considers part of the genre. She mentions some of them in passing,98 but for the most part draws her conclusions in the book from the dat able objects, which constitute approximately 40% of the corpus.99 This method of procedure has its limitations. If one wishes to proceed sys tematically, one is hampered by two factors: (a) the lack of a formal definition of the genre, which was deemed basic to the study, but never in fact formu lated; and (b) no clear idea of which undated or non-datable artifacts the author considers to be members of the corpus. Here it would have helped even if the author had discussed comparable material sometimes associated with the genre that she would wish to exclude from the corpus. In the absence of a definition, functional operating criteria for inclusion in or exclusion from the genre could have aided in clarifying the status quaestionis. Despite these methodological problems, I would like to call attention to several artifacts which would at least merit comparison or contrast with known members of the corpus?in the hope that further discussion may shed more light on key issues. To begin, I present five examples of other texts (four of them classifiable as "datable"), which might be considered for inclusion in the genre. (1) First, there 96 For further remarks on the disparity in size between our artifacts and earlier well-known royal stelae, see Slanski, p. 244. There are other pre-Kassite stelae which are more compa rable in dimensions. 97 The sole exception is MDP 4 163-5 (Meli-Sipak), Artifact B, which is accepted as a member of the corpus in chapter 6 (pp. 190-6), but omitted from the catalogue of artifacts with datable inscriptions in Appendix 1. 98 E.g., pp. 306-7, where she lists 10 "non-datable artifacts." 99 I.e., 65 out of the approximately 160 objects she refers to on p. 7.</page><page sequence="25">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 25 is the thirteenth-century stone slab inscribed with a land donation on behalf of king Kastiliasu IV:100 it was found in Susa with a large number of other arti facts that form a substantial part of this corpus (more than 50 objects), and it records a gift of agricultural land to a leather-worker (ask?pu) for service ren dered to the king. It meets the author's criteria for an acceptable physical form (stone tablet/slab without reliefs), contains several of her constituent elements (narrative, location of land, statement of the event, and divine curses against anyone who undertakes prohibited action), and is datable to a specific reign. It is difficult to see why this text was omitted from her corpus.101 (2) The stone artifact Th. 1932-12-10,18, mentioned by the author as non-datable (p. 306), can in fact be plausibly assigned a date. The date formula is partially preserved (ITI.DU6 U4.r21.[KAM] / [MU.x.KAM DN-DUMU].rUS-SUM-nan) and the mention of B?t-S?n-seme (obv. 4'), which is otherwise attested in published Babylonian texts only under the Second Dynasty of Isin,102 makes it likely that the artifact is to be dated in the reign of Adad-apla-iddina, the only Isin king whose name fits the traces. It is another text found in a temple and had been taken to Assyria presumably as booty.103 (3) Another early Middle Babylonian artifact in the form of a damaged clay cone or cylinder104 may be relevant.105 Though it con tains no explicit date, its paleography, orthography, and style mark it as com ing from the fifteenth century or earlier. One passage clearly deals with land surveying, mentioning an agricultural land registrar (SAG.D?N A.S?.GA), a surveying rope (wa-as-lam), and a measuring rod (GLDIS.NINDA-?ara);106 and the name in i' 5' could?though need not?be restored as [Bur-na-b]u-ri-ia-as (i.e., Burna-Burias I). While the inscription is insufficiently well preserved to be classified as "datable" to a particular reign and its principal clauses are heavily damaged, this artifact is worth consideration as possibly the oldest representative of the genre currently known.107 (4) Sommerfeld in his study 100 MDP 2 95-6 and pi. 20. This would also rank as the earliest known example of a stone artifact of the genre without reliefs, moving the date back by approximately a century. 101 The form is unusual, since the stone is inscribed on only one side and lacks reliefs. Steinmetzer 1922 listed it as no. 63 = P28; Seidl 1968 omitted it from her catalogue (though she listed it in her concordance on p. 67). But the text style and its provenance (Susa, where approximately a third of the presently known artifacts of this genre were found) favor its con sideration here. 102 Nashef 1982: 70. 103 Another Adad-apla-iddina artifact taken to Assyria as booty is published in Frame 1986. 104 UM 55-21-62 (2 NT 356), published in Sassmannshausen 1994. 105 Its publication is cited by the author in her bibliography on p. 340. 106 iii' 5'-6\ 107 If indeed it referred to Burna-Burias I, it could date to either the sixteenth or fifteenth century. Note that Sassmannshausen himself (1999: 55 n. 13) classifies it as a "Tonkudurru."</page><page sequence="26">26 J.A. BRINKMAN concerning feudalism in the Kassite period added one further text to the genre: an inscription existing in two first-millennium copies, on a clay prism and a clay cylinder, which tells of a substantial grant of territory (including towns and settlements) made by Kurigalzu I to the goddess Ishtar of Uruk together with an endowment of temple offerings.108 (5) Charpin (2002: 187) has proposed adding AQi 1, a stone tablet from the time of Nebuchadnezzar II found at Ab? Qub?r, to the corpus.109 The inscription deals with an exchange of property between Nebuchadnezzar II and a private individual and appears to be a stone copy made of a legal transaction on clay.110 If one admits the stone tablet BM 130827 (Weidner 1952-3: 43-45) into the genre as Slanski suggests,111 it is difficult to see why one should not also include this similar stone copy of a standard Neo-BabyIonian legal text.112 If it is accepted, this would be the latest known member of the genre; and, if nos. 3 and 5 are both accepted, the chrono logical range of these artifacts would be extended to at least the fifteenth cen tury down to 599 B.C.113 108 Sommerfeld 1995: 472-3. The text is CT 36 6-7 (duplicate: BIN 2 33). Powell 1982: 111-2 expresses doubts about the authenticity of the text on metrological grounds. This doc ument and the Agum-kakrime text, which is also concerned with property titles, could be interpreted as pseudo-historical. Whether one should include texts composed in the first per son in the same genre as the artifacts under consideration in this article is at least debatable. 109 Published by Bruschweiler 1989a, 1989b. 110 To judge from the surviving phraseology of rev. 24'-26'. 111 Slanski states that this artifact "has heretofore not been considered among the so-called kudurrus" (p. 222). Yet Julian Reade listed it among a group of texts referred to as "Babylonian Boundary-Stones and Comparable Monuments in the British Museum" (1987: 50). Gadd (1951-2: 44) also described it as belonging to "the class of memorial tablets, dat ing from Late Babylonian times." 112 Slanski (pp. 227, 229) calls particular attention to the occurrence of prohibitions and curses in BM 130827 and states that these features are characteristic of the "entitlement nar?." In contrast, one may observe that all other stone tablets without reliefs in her corpus lack such curses (duly noted p. 228), while on the other hand some legal documents on clay contain curses: e.g., Lackenbacher 1983: 145 rev. 3-10 (Nab?-sumu-lib?r, year 1 [1033]); 4 NT 3 (= A 33600) lines 22'-39' (Marduk-bal?ssu-iqbi, year not preserved [c. 818/813]); TuM 2/3 8:22-29 (Marduk-apla-iddina II, year broken away [721/710]); OECT 10 392:23-26 (B?l ibni, year 2 [701]); TuM 2/3 9:24-26 (Esarhaddon, year 6 [675]), BM 113927:19-30 (Samas sumu-ukin, year 10 [658]); BE 8/1 159:17-20 (Ashurbanipal, year 1(+) [647/631]). Thus the presence of curses, sometimes of considerable length, is hardly an infallible diagnostic for texts of this genre. 113 Charpin (2002: 186-7) also suggests that BM 139424, a clay tablet recording a land sale, should be included in the genre. This raises another issue concerning form: should clay tablets be included, or did they merely provide the legal texts from which memorial docu ments in other physical shapes could be copied? An interesting question, but one which seems to involve modern classification more than ancient categories. If one accepts clay tablets containing legal documents, one could in effect expand the genre many times over for the Middle Babylonian and Neo-BabyIonian periods.</page><page sequence="27">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 27 There is also evidence that comparable artifacts originated outside the king dom of Babylonia.114 Of course, one recognized member of the corpus, VAS 1 70 (reigns of Shalmaneser V and S argon II), records legal transactions at Der after that city had been incorporated into Assyria; but this territory seems still to have been following Babylonian traditions at the time. There is also BM 132255, a damaged stele from the Middle Euphrates region around Ra'il, which mentions the private transfer of a field and house from one person to another; even in its present incomplete state, it contains an anthropomorphic figure in relief and a text with historical narrative, a description of the original act of transfer of title, the later conferral of a sealed document, a section dealing with potential future transgressors (beginning mannu ark? sa ill?mma), and curses.115 The stele of B?l-Harran-b?lu-usur from Tell Abta, decorated with several divine symbols and a depiction of the donor, presents in its text an historical narrative, a notice of establishing offerings for the gods and tax exemptions for the peo ple of a city, injunctions against removal of the stele (called a nar?), blessings, and curses; it also describes the erection of the stele in a temple.116 A stone tablet of Adad-nirari III, containing divine symbols including a long represen tation of a snake draped across the surface (reminiscent of similar decorations common on the Babylonian classical stelae of this type),117 records a royal con veyance of land to a governor, including an invocation of curses against any one who would in the future mistreat or remove the artifact.118 It has also been suggested that the Black Stone of Esarhaddon bears some similarities to Babylonian artifacts of this genre.119 Should any of these objects be considered as potential 114 Slanski in her discussion of the geographical range of these artifacts (e.g., p. 160) deals only with Babylonia. Here, in the interests of better defining the subject, we consider other possibilities. 115 The text is mentioned by Reade 1987: 50, and a picture of it appears in the British Museum Quarterly 26 (1962-63) pi. XXXVb. Note also from the Middle Euphrates a stone stele of Ninurta-kudurr?-usur (RIMB 2 S.O. 1002.10), governor of Suhu, relating a cult restora tion with some similarities to the Sippar Samas artifact; the reliefs portray a deity, a wor shipper (the dedicator?), and divine symbols. 116 Picture: SAA 12 p. 90 (and frequently elsewhere).

B?rker-Kl?hn (1982: 51 n. 177) suggests this stele could be considered a "kudurru." 119 See most recently Porter 1993, with fuller discussion. The symbols on this stele are not similar to the usual divine symbols attested elsewhere on objects of the genre under consid eration, and it has been suggested that they represent Assyrian hieroglyphs (Finkel and Reade 1996).</page><page sequence="28">28 J.A. BRINKMAN members of the genre? Could they at least have been used for comparative purposes in helping to define the distinctiveness of the artifactual group under consideration? There are other Babylonian stelae with sculptures, which have sometimes been loosely associated with the genre. BM 90837 (BBSt 37), though most of its text is now missing, contains divine and other symbols and mentions finan cial statistics, perhaps by way of narrative. BM 90834 (BBSt 34) describes itself as a nar? (NA4.RU.A an-na-a), is designed to be permanent (a-na sa-at u4-me), contains blessings and curses, and depicts in relief two anthropomorphic figures and divine symbols. Since these artifacts are not "datable" in Slanski's sense, in the absence of either a formal definition of the genre or a list of the non-dat able objects within the corpus, it is not always clear whether objects such as these should merit discussion even by way of contrast.120 Clarification of the boundaries of the genre might also be helped by com parisons with other contemporary texts recording official land grants or tax exemptions on other media, such as the land grant by Kass?-b?l-z?ri, governor of the Sealand, to the goddess Usur-amassa (copy on a clay tablet, original on a seal)121 and B?l-ibni's rescript of tax exemptions bestowed on the town of Sa usur-Adad with an account of reestablishing a local cult (copy on a clay tablet).122 Comparison as well with early Neo-BabyIonian legal texts on clay dealing with such topics as real estate transactions, prebends, and inheritance123 could also aid in sharpening the focus of the investigation. Such considerations could help to establish more about the structure of the artifactual texts (and whether it differs significantly from that of similar texts on clay) and how the several physical forms ?in clay as well as stone?served various utilitarian functions. It is obvious that not all the objects described above in this section would be judged?by anyone's standards?to fall within the genre under discussion in this article. Greater definition of the corpus and its boundaries continues to remain a prime desideratum. 120 BBSt 37 is damaged, with little text now left; the statistics on current commodity prices and other phraseology can be paralleled in royal inscriptions. BBSt 34 is clearly a memor ial, but seems unrelated to financial interests or titles. 121 RIMB 2 B.4.0.2001. See also Beaulieu 2000a: 29-32. 122 RIMB 2 B.6.26.1.

Quality of the Presentation Scholars appreciate that many of the most important inscriptions on these artifacts were superbly published by their early editors. In particular, V. Scheil (especially in MDP 2, 4, 6, and 10, appearing between 1900 and 1908) and L.W. King (BBSt, 1912) produced editions of significant numbers of texts that set a high standard in their day and continue to be used with profit after approx imately a century. W.J. Hinke (1907, 1911) edited fewer texts, but offered pio neering analyses of philological and archeological aspects of these objects.124 Steinmetzer (1922) studied the documentary types and iconography of the arti facts. Seidl (1968, 1989) dealt comprehensively with their symbols and other reliefs. Decades of philological advance in the field of Assyriology now in evitably necessitate updating?mostly minor?of the earliest text editions. The volume under review here attempts to bring new insights to bear on this well-studied material. The book itself is marred by obvious deficiencies, not all of which can be attributed to the author. A significant number of pages have gaps in the text or missing words, sometimes in key passages, such as the definition of "entitlement."125 There are an inordinate number of typographical errors126 and misspellings127 and even occasional solecisms128 and grammatical errors.129 There are cross-references to non-existent passages130 as well as mis citations in the indexes themselves: for instance, in the index of "Texts Cited" (pp. 360-2), more than 95% of the page references to Appendixes 1, 2, and 4 are wrong. Also, in a book with so many overlapping sections and repetition of material between chapters, lack of a subject index is a significant drawback. And there are numerous inconsistencies where statements made in one part of the book are contradicted in other places.131 124 Ungnad also published the texts of several artifacts in copy in these early years (VAS 1 35-37, 57-58, 70). 125 P. 114. Other pages with missing sections or words include pp. 11, 13, 27, 52, 70, 83, 106, 112, 117, 130, 179, 209, 211, 216, 233, 249, 269, 293, 303 (the gaps on pp. 334 and 338 seem to be spacing anomalies rather than omissions). 126 E.g., "inlcuded" (p. 63), "Bablyonia" (p. 274), "foriegn" (pp. 287, 289), "follwed" (p. 305), "govenor" and "perfomed" (p. 320). 127 E.g., "existance" (p. 9), "comemmorating" (p. 66). These are especially noticeable for foreign titles and proper names in the bibliography (pp. 327-46). 128 E.g., the use of "patrimony" (p. 175), where "patronym" is meant; "capitols" for "cap itals" (p. 190); "levy" for "levee" (pp. 222-3); "principle" for "principal" (p. 321). 129 E.g., "two century's worth" (p. 16), "a on-going source" (p. 234), "the practice of com memorating ... date back" (p. 269). 130 E.g., the translation of 48 lines from a Meli-Sipak document on pp. 277-8 is said to be repeated from a passage citation in the second chapter (which does not exist) or the refer ence on p. 304 n. 19 to Seidl 1989: 277 (there is no such page). 131 For examples, see n. 5 above and pp. 33-4 below. Note also that the gods whose names</page><page sequence="30">30 JA. BRINKMAN One major advantage of the presentation is that the author often cites the pas sages?sometimes lengthy?on which she bases her interpretations, usually both in Akkadian transcription and in translation. This facilitates the review of doc umentary evidence and greatly assists the reader. We have discussed in preced ing sections of this review various deficiencies in the argumentation: e.g., lack of a formal definition of the genre, failure to establish a consistent documentary pattern for the texts, and unsupported inferences about the decentralization of the Babylonian monarchy in the Late Bronze Age. But there are other problems as well. For instance, on pp. 27-32, the frequent association and pairing of misru (border) and kudurru in texts are used to support the argument that kudurru belongs to the genus "boundary" or "boundary marker"; but, on pp. 32-7, similar pairing and association of nar? and kudurru are adduced as "clear and unambiguous textual evidence" that these two words signify fundamentally different things ("boundary" or "boundary marker" vs. "sculpted stone artifact"). The author shows insufficient acquaintance with standard reference works and with previous literature (even when the latter is cited in her bibliography). Her discussion of the writing DIS-w (pp. 78-9) had long before been obviated by Sommerfeld's observation (1984: 304) that this is actually 1.K?S and to be read ammatu.132 Her assumption that the term isqu designates simply "prebend" are listed as Namma and Nuska in the index on p. 349 are usually referred to as Nammu (as in Ur-Nammu) and Nusku elsewhere in the book. YOS 1 37 is titled "Marduk-s?pik-zeri YOS I 37" on p. 299, but "Marduk-n?din-ahhe YOS I 37" on p. 315. BBSt 36 (Nab?-apla iddina) is classified among the plaques (p. 156), but usually referred to as a tablet elsewhere, including the section especially dedicated to it (pp. 196-222). 132 See also Charpin 2002: 178-80, who convincingly links this ammatu with Old Babylonian ummatu, the original tablet in a chain of transmission of property titles (with cita tion of earlier literature, including the basic study of Wilcke 1982: 450-83). It is not clear whether ammatu in Middle and early Neo-BabyIonian always has the same nuance as in Old Babylonian. The word occurs in seven passages in six texts (Slanski, p. 78, states that there are three occurrences in her datable corpus, even though Sommerfeld 1984: 304 had listed all the passages, including six "datable"). Four of these occurrences are linked closely with tuppu, in such phrases as tup-pa-am u am-ma-tam sa A.SA su-a-ti (Sommerfeld 1984: 301 ii 3-5, undated), i-na ka-nak 1.K?S u IM.DUB (BBSt 4 ii 1, before the witness list, Meli Sipak), l.K?S ? tup-pi A.S? (MDP 6 34 iii 11 and 15, as a description of the document(s) sealed by the king and before the witness list, Marduk-apla-iddina I); whether ammatu and tuppu refer to separate documents in such passages or whether these words should be taken as hendiadys is not clear. In another passage, where the word occurs alone, it is also in the heading of a witness list: i-na ka-nak l.KUS su-a-tu (Hinke 1911: 27 v 8, Nebuchadnezzar I). In the sixth instance, the text breaks immediately after the phrase i-na ka-na-ak 1.K?S (Page 1967: 63 i 20, Marduk-apla-iddina I); so it is impossible to tell whether ? tup-pi might have followed or not, but this is almost certainly the prelude to a witness list. In the seventh attestation, the word is written as a plural: T.K?S.MES bi-rim NA4.KISIB-sw (he sealed for her for all time), literally "documents affixed with his seal" (MDP 10 88 i 17, Meli-Sipak); the documents (or perhaps document) in question here were drawn up for the transmission</page><page sequence="31">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 31 even in Middle Babylonian texts does not note that both CAD and AHw dis tinguish "prebend" as an exclusively first-millennium usage, with other mean ings attributed to second-millennium occurrences.133 She does not reference the CAD treatment of sipr?tu (S/3 [1992] 72-3), which is surely relevant to her dis cussion of royal sealing practices (pp. 121-2 and passim). Her treatment of "Advice to a Prince" (pp. 279-80) cites no literature after 1960, though there have been new texts and commentary published that are pertinent.134 The sec tion dealing with her key term nar? does not embody much relevant philologi cal literature on the subject. She fails to mention Seidl's observations on the later re-use of BBSt 9 (Nab?-muk?n-apli), with the addition at that time of two further human figures and a reworking of the background (1968: 95), which could have assisted her interpretation of the iconography of this stele. The difficulty still remains that the woman most prominently portrayed in the reliefs (identified as H-rfa-iC-se-ri in the caption) is not mentioned in the final version of the text on the artifact. Other difficulties discussed below, such as her mis translations or misinterpretations of common words or writings such as ahu, ersetu, and MU.MES, could have been avoided simply by consulting the stan dard dictionaries. Text editions or citations are not particularly accurate. A few examples will suffice. In the new edition of BM 130827 (pp. 222-4) based on collation of the of land being granted, the tax exemptions bestowed for the same parcel were said to be recorded on a tuppu (MDP 10 89 ii 9), as already pointed out by Charpin (2002: 179). Note that two of these ammatu documents dealt with land newly brought under cultivation (MDP 10 87-94, Meli-Sipak; Hinke 1911 no. 5, Nebuchadnezzar I); and so the texts could have been original documents in the chain of transmission in the Old Babylonian sense. In other instances, the pertinent section is either insufficiently preserved (Sommerfeld 1984, Page 1967); or there is no indication that the land in question had not previously been part of the agricultural system (e.g., BBSt 4, MDP 6 32-39). Except for the "undatable" document (Sommerfeld 1984), which is probably to be assigned to the fourteenth century or earlier, all these texts date to the twelfth century, the latest being from 1110 B.C. The reading 1.K?S = (1) ammatu was first proposed by Borger 1956: 31, then again in Borger 1978: 129 no. 318. CAD L 157a (1973) interpreted the word as Ux(DlS)-?, following an older tradition, but marked the reading as uncertain. Sommerfeld 1984: 304-5 pointed out that the syllabic writing am-ma-tam favored Borger's interpretation; and Charpin 2002: 178 80 provided the Old Babylonian link (with ummatum) which clarified the meaning of ammatu in context. It should be noted that a related word ummu is used in a similar sense ("original document") in later Neo-BabyIonian in the sixth century (IM.DUB-iw AMA A.S?, YOS 19 92:10; see Beaulieu 2000a: 37-9). 133 E.g., the Nazi-Maruttas kudurru treated on pp. 70-4, where GIS.SUB ? in the opening line is translated simply "prebend," when it is more likely to mean something like "temple share." The meaning of isqu in second-millennium texts deserves further study. 134 A survey of literature over the intervening years may now be conveniently found in Biggs 2004.</page><page sequence="32">32 JA.

Obv. 3 is not to be translated "land (along) the canal Kanisurra, which (is) within Uruk" but "the city quarter of Kanisurra in Uruk." MU.MES (not MU.?MES?) is the correct reading in obv. 20; it is a common rebus or para nomastic writing for su(w)?ti in the Neo-BabyIonian period.137 In other texts, MU.SAG RN LUGAL (p. 120) is not the "first year RN (was) king," but the "accession year of king RN." dDIN on p. 119 is actually AN.S?R, a common writing for the god Ashur. The titles ka-su (p. 75) and ka-lu (p. 203) are both misreadings for kartappu (KIR4.DAB).138 GAR.KUR (pp. 75, 77 A 16) is sakin m?ti not s?kin t?mi. On pp. 206-7 (BBSt 36 v 7, 35), ahu is not "payout" but "half" (of the king's portion); in the same text (p. 203), the final word in vi 16 is to be read SUM-^??1 (not SUM-/7z7&lt;2).139 In a notation on a Marduk-apla iddina I text (Page 1967), the editor objects to the phrase ku-d[ur] da-ra-a-ti on the grounds that kudur is incorrect and a plural would be expected with d?r?ti (p. 32), apparently unaware that d?r?ti in such cases is a plural substantive and the preceding word is expected to be a noun in the construct.140 For BBSt 11 ii 16 (p. 56): i-na \G\-su means "on its (i.e., the artifact's) face," not "before" (the 135 I have rechecked the original text in the British Museum (April 2005) to verify the fol lowing corrections.

Except for a missing diacritic on -s?-, Weidner (1952-53) had read these signs correctly, whereas Slanski introduces three new errors, omitting the final sign of the personal name, reading KU as KUR in the title, and reading UN[UG] as URU in the geographical name. 137 This is widely attested in Neo-Babylonian legal texts, and it is noted in standard ref erence books: CAD, AHw, Borger 1978. The writing MU.MES, standing for the plural of sumu, "name," would have been pronounced suw?ti in Neo-Babylonian (when intervocalic -m- was sounded as -w-); the same writing was then accepted as a transference for the homonymous demonstrative su(w)?ti. 138 This occupation is cited in her glossary on p. 321. 139 The damaged space is too small for -na here (compare the sign at the end of vi 18); and parallel passages with ana ?m(?) s?ti nadanu in ninth- through seventh-century texts of this type uniformly have SUM-su (e.g., BBSt 29 ii 6, VAS 1 36 ii 15, VAS 1 37 iv 55) or a syllabically written id-din-s?

The end of the Kassite dynasty is placed in the "10th century" on p. 8 and "the middle of the 12th century" on the following page. The text VAS 1 70 (Sargon II) is said to contain six transactions in one place (pp. 96-7) and seven in another (p. 316); its earliest event is reported as occurring in the second year of Shalmaneser V and in the same king's third year (both on p. 96, seven lines apart).146 The unidentified "king list" referred to on p. 275 is actually one of her own texts, the Sitti-Marduk artifact (BBSt 6). Sitti-Marduk himself was neither the "bel p?h?ti 'governor' of the province Bit-Piri'-Amurru" (p. 170) nor the "valiant sakin m?ti" (p. 214); his title was bel b?ti, and he presided over Bit Karziabku. The earliest example of an artifact used to commemorate a non royal event is not in the time of Enlil-n?din-apli (p. 102), but several decades earlier in the reign of Itti-Marduk-bal?tu (BBSt 30). BBSt 27 is not about "the apprenticing of three boys," but about paying for the release or ransom of three sons of Bel-us?tu.147 The last Kassite king, Enlil-n?din-ahi, is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Enlil-n?din-ahhe (e.g., pp. 163, 310) and even as 141 There are also an unusual number of misspellings of Akkadian words, e.g., satukku, sukallu, and satammmu on pp. 324-5 alone.

For items not found there, examples may be seen as follows: Atrattas (above n. 142), Iqissa-Ba5u (p. 77), Ina-isi-itir (p. 123), Kidini (p. 350), Husardu (p. 79). Several of these names are read in different ways in various places in the book, sometimes on the same page. 146 This year is identified as "726" (p. 96); it is actually 724. 147 The operative verb here is ip-tur (line 6).</page><page sequence="34">34 J.A.

The earliest stone plaque, as defined by Slanski, does not date from the reign of Marduk-z?kir-sumi I (p. 156), but from the reign of his father, Nab?-apla-iddina.149 Both laputtu (p. 322) and sakkanakku (p. 325) were not obsolete titles under the Kassite dy nasty, but were borne by living men in artifactual inscriptions.150 bel p?hati (p. 320) does not have the meaning "provincial governor" in Babylonia in the mid eighth century,151 while the s?kin t?mi (p. 325) has gubernatorial status from approximately the mid-ninth century on (not the eleventh century), "ittiqu" (glossary, p. 321) is not a word meaning "border line," but the G present tense of the verb et?qu, "to cross, transgress." There are no such texts as "Adad-apla-iddina BBSt 25" (p. 158)152 and "Marduk-n?din-ahh? BBSt 9" (p. 171). Unfortunately, errors of this sort are sprinkled liberally throughout the volume and may cause prob lems for readers who are relatively unacquainted with the period.153 The author suggests other topics for consideration by future researchers. Among such desiderata are study of the paleography and orthography of these documents (p. 179). These subjects deserve careful investigation and should dis tinguish carefully between sign forms on stone vs. clay texts and apprentice vs. trained hands (even among stone engravers). The paleography of these inscrip tions is not uniformly archaizing, and the development of the Babylonian syllabary between the Middle Babylonian and Neo-Babylonian phases of the language can be illustrated at least in part from these texts.154 More careful 148 And, conversely, Enlil-n?din-apli is once mistakenly referred to as Enlil-n?din-ahhe (p. 314).

Both titles are also attested in contemporary administrative texts. 151 The reference in ABL 989 is now known to be to the governor of Khorsabad during the time of S argon II, not to a Babylonian official. The Hofkalendar references are from the early sixth century. 152 The text that is meant here is presumably BBSt 13, which contains part of a map. 153 Many of the errors cited in the preceding paragraphs appear already in the author's dissertation. 154 Study of post-OB Babylonian dialects is an exceedingly complex subject, not helped by divergent usage of basic classifications (Middle Babylonian, Neo-BabyIonian, Late Babylonian, Standard Babylonian; mittelbabylonisch, neubabylonisch, sp?tbabylonisch, jungbabylonisch) by various authorities. Even chronological boundaries between dialects are not agreed on: thus the Isin II and Sealand II artifactual texts are classified as (early) Neo-Baby Ionian by the CAD and by Hyatt (1941), but as mittelbabylonisch by von Soden (GAG, AHw). Synchronie variations are often overlooked: e.g., in the MB Archives from D?r-Kurigalzu, at least four different types of scribal hands may be distinguished among administrative texts, domestic letters, international letters, and scholarly texts. Contemporary sign forms on clay</page><page sequence="35">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 35 study would also be welcome on other topics, a few of which are raised only incidentally and sometimes settled impressionistically. For instance, the asser tion that the verb r?mu (ri?mu) is not widely attested outside this corpus (p. 172) is inaccurate; the verb is also used in Middle Babylonian letters, Neo Assyrian land grants and letters, various Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions and letters), and legal texts as late as the Seleucid period.155 Another statement that these texts provide the "overwhelming majority" of the writings of L?.?.MAS/BAR for sangu (p. 226) is not borne out by the data; this can be seen simply by con sulting Sassmannshausen 2001: 64-6 and by noting the many uses of sang? in Neo-Babylonian family names.156 13. Conclusions Slanski's book raises important questions about a significant historical source type. The answers that she provides for these questions, i.e., her eight theses (pp. 2-3 of this article), are of uneven quality; and not all are likely to com mand universal assent. In general, it may be agreed that nar? is the most common self-referent for some types of these artifacts, that the legal actions commemo rated on the artifacts were designed to have permanent effect, that the artifacts were not themselves legal documents, that they were most often meant for dis play,157 and that the present balance of evidence?archeological as well as tex tual?favors their initial placement in temples. It is much less likely that these artifactual documents may be fittingly characterized as concerned with "an and stone can differ significantly. Many legal texts from the eighth and seventh centuries seem to be neat scholarly copies, not always marked as such; and their script is quite differ ent from contemporary cursive, which occurs occasionally on legal documents, but more often on administrative texts. The degree of education or competence of the scribe plus regional and scholarly traditions and the formality of the document must also be taken into account. And from time to time, our neatly reconstructed scenarios are shattered by such rude intruders as the eighth-century epistolary archive from Nippur (Cole 1996), whose scribes obviously did not consult our standard works on Neo-Baby Ionian grammar and wrote with a lively script, morphology, and syntax that were all their own. Dialectal differentiation is not just a matter of comparing LUGAL and SUHUS signs, patterns of U vs. ? and SU vs. S? usage, and vagaries of CVC signs across sundry texts; and longtime students of first-millen nium documents will be surprised to find how many "late" features are attested already in Middle Babylonian in colloquial texts (sometimes with sandhi writings) as well as in sur prisingly formal context. Further study of evolving syntactic patterns is also a must. 155 CAD R (1999) 146; approximately half of the r?mu references in this volume and in the CAD card files (including instances not cited in the R volume) are from texts outside this genre. 156 E.g., those listed in Bongenaar 1997: 541. Neo-Baby Ionian writings with E.BAR may be found in CAD S/l (1989) 378b, 381b. 157 At least before the gods, if perhaps not on view to the general public.</page><page sequence="36">36 JA. BRINKMAN ongoing source of income," that their inscriptions share a basic textual pattern, and that the objects were viewed as a private usurpation of a former royal pre rogative (with the attendant conclusions about the weakening of central author ity in Babylonia as part of a trend taking place across the Near East). As to the assertion that the designation "kudurru" must be abandoned in favor of "entitlement nar?," the argument is not convincing. First, "kudurru" cannot be termed inaccurate or a misnomer, since the Babylonians clearly used it themselves in such contexts as "the name of this kudurru is ..." at the very start of an artifactual inscription and in curses against persons who would tam per with the memorial (i.e., kudurru) itself. Second, kudurru is a distinctive label; and, when applied to inscribed materials, it has been restricted to artifacts of this genre.158 Third, nar? is a generic term, applied to a wide variety of inscribed stone stelae, to memorials made from materials other than stone, and to texts of other literary genres. Fourth, "entitlement," the qualifying modifier proposed for nar? and redefined in a broad sense as title to an ongoing source of income, is not a particularly apt designation because many of these texts are not concerned with income (much less entitlement income in the narrow sense?now common in the U.S.?of a claim to a stream of financial assistance, particularly from an institutional source). "Entitlement nar?" and "financial memorial" are, of course, possible designations; but one can hardly insist on the exclusion of the traditional term kudurru. Finally, we must be aware that neither nar? nor kudurru is attested as referring to each of the five physical types of these artifacts; thus each has its limitations. As to the claimed originality or freshness of the author's perspectives and conclusions, again one must distinguish carefully. Several of Slanski's theses, including most of those that are likely to be generally accepted, had previously been proposed by other scholars, sometimes many decades ago.159 It was 158 Though the term has occasionally been applied by analogy to the third-millennium "ancient kudurrus," with which our texts are not likely to be confused. 159 One of the weakest points of the author's article summarizing her dissertation is her opening survey of current scholarly opinion?without documentation?, which verges on car icature (Slanski 2000: 95-7). There she claims that the artifacts in question had been viewed almost uniformly as actual boundary markers defining the limits of granted land; she fails to mention that previous authors had noted that nar? was the most common term used in antiq uity to refer to the artifacts and that these artifacts had most likely been placed in temples. In the same article (p. 95) and in the book under review (pp. 65-6, 276-7, 287, 289), the author uncritically employs the term "feudal" to characterize royal land grant systems as classified by modern scholars. In so far as I have been able to ascertain, her characterization derives principally from a short, largely undocumented article published by Kemal Balkan in 1943 (now available in translation as Balkan 1986) and the acceptance of its terminology in a later semi-popular cultural history by von Soden (published in 1985, with an English translation</page><page sequence="37">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 37 pointed out by Hinke almost a century ago that nar? is the self-referent term most commonly used to designate these artifacts.160 It has been also been gen erally accepted that these objects are not legal documents, were meant for dis play purposes, and were usually deposited in temples (rather than used as boundary markers).161 It is self-evident from the inscriptions that the commem orated conferral of property or exemptions was meant to be permanent and equally apparent that many of the objects are decorated with divine symbols and other scenes. Slanski's new observations are basically: (1) that the desig nation kudurru is a misnomer; (2) that these artifacts commemorate title to an ongoing source of income; (3) that the texts have a uniform structure; (4) that the artifacts should henceforth be termed "entitlement nar?s"; (5) that the genre is evidence of the usurpation of a former royal prerogative by non-royal offi cials or institutions; and (6) that this usurpation indicated a lessening of central authority and exemplifies a wave of broader social changes occurring throughout the Near East at that time. We have reviewed each of these assertions in turn and have concluded: (1) that kudurru was used by the Babylonians to designate artifacts of this type and so can hardly be called a misnomer; (2) that "ongo ing source of income" is not a particularly appropriate label especially when applied to such items as land ownership or tax exemptions; (3) that these texts do not have a uniform, but instead a widely varying, structure; (4) that the phrase "entitlement nar?" is hardly an improvement in nomenclature, as opposed to the traditional term kudurru;162 (5) that use of nar?s before the Kassite period may not necessarily have been a royal prerogative; and (6) that present historical evi dence does not support an interpretation of the weakening of Babylonian cen tral authority in the heyday of this genre under the Kassite rulers (much less other aspects of the Liverani or Slanski models, such as decreasing heritability of land). Thus, while several of Slanski's theses which agree with previous available as von Soden 1994), at least according to Slanski's book, p. 276. Balkan's recon struction has long been seen as defective on other grounds and is now viewed as more of an historical curiosity. Most serious studies recently devoted to the subject of land tenure ac cording to the artifacts have carefully avoided using terms such as "feudal" to describe Babylonian society (see, for example, the explicit discussion of the topic, with literature, in Sommerfeld 1995, especially pp. 467-9). 160 Hinke 1907: 2 n. 1. 161 E.g., Seidl 1968: 72-3, Brinkman 1981: 269-70. 162 If the genre were newly discovered today, we might well select a designation other than kudurru or entitlement nar? for it, since neither of these seems an ideal choice. But, as with the traditional terms "Assyriology" and "Assyrian Dictionary," which no longer aptly de scribe their subject fields, there is often little point in tinkering with long-used terminology unless there is clear consensus that the term needs to be changed and a replacement has been overwhelmingly agreed on.</page><page sequence="38">38 JA. BRINKMAN research are also borne out by her work, most of her new conclusions either are based on inadequate assessment of the data or advocate questionable new ter minology which is not really needed. Two other express aims of the book call for further comment: (a) the attempt to provide a holistic interpretation of the objects with an integrated view of their "textual, visual, and artifactual features" (p. 13), and (b) the establishment of a datable selection of objects to "enable evaluation of chronological develop ments" within the genre (p. 65). The author provides wide-ranging discussion of archeological, artistic, and textual properties of the material, though sometimes without much integration between the archeological and philological discus sions. Perhaps the most noticeable failing here is the lack of serious investiga tion of the philological evidence for the use of na-ru-a and nar?(m) in the Old Babylonian period and before. The archeological assessment, concentrating on a few exceptional royal stelae from these times, provides only a limited view of the material. It is also essential to determine how the Sumerian and Akkadian terms were actually used in context, and especially to gauge their gradual dis sociation from linkage with both "stone" and "monument" and their declin ing status from being a strictly royal prerogative before the end of the Old Babylonian dynasty. For the second topic, very little attention is paid by the author to fundamental chronological developments within the genre; and here is an opportunity missed. For one can trace in broad terms the evolution of the genre: from the common royal land grant163 on classical engraved stone stelae in Kassite times (principally 1375-1155 B.C.), through the broadening of both text type (to include various legal transactions of officials and private persons) and physical form (expanding to cover stone tablets, with or without reliefs) under the Second Dynasty of Isin (1157-1026), and then a subsequent partial narrowing of the genre to conform generally to contemporary legal patterns, dis carding the old royal grant form without witnesses or mention of sealing (1025 650).164 This chronological development and possible political parallels are discussed more fully in the excursus below. The word kudurru itself deserves further study. Both standard dictionaries, the CAD and AHw, agree on two basic meanings, namely "boundary" and "boundary stone," but list them in inverse order, without discussing explicitly which meaning they consider primary. CAD adds a further meaning, "region, territory," which could easily arise by synecdoche from "boundary."165 Use of 163 Or the affirmation of a previous land grant or the grant of tax exemptions. 164 The "plaque" form is introduced in the middle of this last phase, in the ninth century; but whether one should accept this as a separate physical type is open to debate. 165 The same transference occurs between meanings of misru, also "boundary."</page><page sequence="39">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 39 kudurru and of its denominative verb kad?ru are both first attested in the Middle Babylonian and Middle Assyrian periods, roughly about the same time as the earliest appearance of the artifacts under study. Neither the noun nor the verb is used in sufficiently distinctive contexts to determine much about the original significance of the noun or whether it clearly referred to an object that was placed outside temple precincts. We should bear this in mind when using such translations as "boundary stone" or "boundary marker," which may have more to do with recording a description of real property than with a benchmark standing on the land itself, kudurru has at least two older homonyms: kudurru "basket/container" (known from the Old Babylonian period on) and kudurru "son, heir" (attested first in Old Assyrian personal names and continuing there after). Finally, in this book, the author calls attention once again to an underutilized body of material, which is significant from a textual as well as an archeologi cal point of view. In her interesting but flawed study, she addresses important issues; and it is clear that the subject is ripe for more serious and systematic consideration, not only of the artifacts themselves, but of their broader signi ficance across a poorly understood span of history. These objects deserve further analysis, not least for what they reveal about political, social, and religious institutions and about individuals across a range of situations, in good times as well as bad. Placing these artifacts in historical context is a continuing task that will reward the dedicated researcher. Excursus Kassite Royal land grants and the Historical Development of the Kudurru/Nar? Genre: A Brief Introduction Seidl (1968, 1989) has traced the evolution of the major archeological styles of reliefs on these artifacts and set up a scheme for their periodization. This we can also do briefly and in broad terms for the historical development of the major documentary forms of this genre. The picture, admittedly, is impression istic and subject to revision as more material emerges. The royal land grant,166 which is by far the predominant type of document in the opening centuries of this genre during the Kassite period, apparently begins 166 jjere referring both to original grants and to affirmations/restorations of earlier grants. Many of these grants bestow not just land, but tax exemptions or other favors.</page><page sequence="40">40 JA. BRINKMAN as a statement of royal largesse167?in a form quite different from contemporary legal documents. Almost all legal documents of this time, beginning with Kadasman Harbe I (c. 1400), include witnesses, a notation of sealing,168 and in most cases a date, usually by month, day, and regnal year of a monarch.169 The earliest of our land grants contain none of these elements. Over the years, some mention of royal sealing is introduced into the genre, indicating the existence of a par allel document on clay, which provided the legal basis for the grant.170 Toward the very end of the Kassite period, during the reigns of Meli-Sipak (1186-1172) and Marduk-apla-iddina I (1171-1159), witnesses begin to be listed on some of these documents, preceded by a statement such as "at the sealing of this docu ment (were present)," but still without a date.171 Thus the earliest royal land grants were not in the form of contemporary legal documents, though they over time introduced some elements found in such texts. It is also noteworthy that during this period almost all artifacts of this genre were classical stone stelae embellished with divine symbols, rarely with cultic or other scenes.172 The prin cipal exception seems to be the early forerunners in the form of clay cones,173 which date to the fourteenth century and earlier.174 167 E.g., BBSt 1-2, 4-5; MDP 2 86-94, 97-111 (four texts); MDP 6 31-9, 42-3 (two texts); Arnaud 1972: 164-76 (two texts); MDP 10 87-94 (one text, multiple grants). 168 Or impression of fingernail marks (supru) or garment hems (sissiktu) in place of a seal, presumably in the case of less wealthy individuals. 169 Exceptions are not common, though there are undated legal texts (e.g., UET 7 17, Ni. 1646), texts without either a date or sealing (e.g., UET 7 6), and texts with an incomplete date (e.g., UM 29-16-99, which has a regnal year, but no king's name). Some of the earlier dated kudurrus men tion only month and regnal year (e.g., IM 49991, BBSt 25, and Lambert 1981) or just regnal year (Hinke 1911 no. 5); most later texts have a full date: month-day-year-name of king. 170 E.g., Arnaud 1972: 172:77 (Kudur-Enlil), MDP 10 88 i 17-18 (Meli-Sipak). The restored verb (with an atypical grammatical form) in Arnaud 1972: 167 ii 49+x (Nazi Maruttas) makes this context less certain. Sealing is also mentioned in IM 49991 (Nazi Maruttas; ka-an-gu ka-nik occurs in ii' 5, Iraq, Supplement 1944, fig. 21); but insufficient context is preserved to determine whether a royal act was being described. 171 E.g., BBSt 4 (Meli-Sipak), BBSt 5 (Marduk-apla-iddina I), MDP 6 31-9 (the original grant by Meli-Sipak was unsealed?this was renewed and sealed by Marduk-apla-iddina I). Page 1967 preserves the heading of the witness list (ina kan?k ammati, i 20), but the list itself is broken away (Marduk-apla-iddina I). Note that IM 49991 (unpublished except in photo in Iraq, Supplement 1944, fig. 21 and elsewhere), by way of exception and at an ear lier date (1303) than these other Kassite period texts with witnesses, has a date (VHI-year 5, Nazi-Maruttas), a witness list, and mention of sealing (see n. 41 above); but the transaction itself is not sufficiently preserved for us to ascertain whether it dealt with a royal grant. 172 The only stone text of this type from the Kassite period not on a classical stele is MDP 2 95-6 (Kastiliasu IV), which was produced apparently by local officials in a remote province, by royal authorization, and is on a stone slab. 173 The precise physical form of some other items on clay, such as that published in Sassmannshausen 1994 or the nar? sa hasbi mentioned in the following footnote, has yet to be determined. 174 BBSt 1 and its duplicate (Kurigalzu); Sassmannshausen 1994 (probably 15th century or</page><page sequence="41">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 41 Under the Isin II dynasty (1157-1026), the scope of the genre begins to expand, as it appears in various physical forms and is used for different types of transactions. Royal land grants continue, but they are no longer the almost exclusive subject. Instead, land grants by officials, private land transactions, and tax exemptions without bestowal of land join the genre.175 Some royal grants of land are not in the form of legal documents, lacking witnesses and date;176 and a royal grant of tax exemption has witnesses but no reference to date or seal ing.177 A private land grant and a private land purchase also lack witnesses, date, and reference to sealing.178 But the majority of transactions now are becoming much closer in form to legal documents, with witnesses, mention of sealing, and date;179 and even royal grants, especially in and after the time of Marduk-n?din-ahhe (1099-1082), take on the same characteristics.180 The same reign also sees the last attestation of a private land purchase without witnesses, sealing, or date181 and the earliest example of the phrase later in common use: (gabar?) kunuk sarri sa sipr?ti, calling attention specifically to the clay legal document at the basis of the transaction.182 Also under this dynasty, physical types other than the classical stone stelae begin to appear: the oldest known examples of stone tablets without reliefs, beginning in the time of Itti-Marduk bal?tu (1139-1132),183 and of stone tablets with reliefs, first attested under Adad apla-iddina (1068-1047).184 Thus the old genre continues under Isin II rule, but undergoes a fundamental shift: it is no longer restricted to royal grants or to the form of the classical stelae. After the Isin dynasty till the end of the genre, all texts?in so far as one can judge from well-preserved examples?conform to the pattern of legal documents, earlier); MDP 2 91 premier m?daillon line 3 (mention of an earlier document from the time of Nazi-Maruttas as a nar? sa hasbi, "clay stele"). How such clay objects may have devel oped into the later classical form of the stone stele is unclear. 175 E.g., BBSt 7 (c. Marduk-n?din-ahhe), 11 (c. Enlil-n?din-apli), 25 (Marduk-n?din-ahhe); Caillou Michaux (c. Marduk-n?din-ahhe). 176 E.g., BBSt 24 (Nebuchadnezzar I). BE 1 149 (Marduk-ahh?-er?ba) lacks witnesses, ref erence to sealing, and date. 177 BBSt 6 (Nebuchadnezzar I). 178 Caillou Michaux; BBSt 7 (both from approximately the time of Marduk-n?din-ahhe). 179 E.g., Hinke 1911: no. 5 (Nebuchadnezzar I); BBSt 8, 25; YOS 1 37 rev. (theTatter three documents date to the time of Marduk-n?din-ahhe). 180 BBSt 8, Lambert 1981, Rashid 1980. The slightly earlier Hinke kudurru (Hinke 1911: no. 5, Nebuchadnezzar I) also has witnesses, mention of sealing, and a regnal year date. The most noteworthy later exception is BE 1 149 from the time of Marduk-ahh?-er?ba, which lacks witnesses, date, and sealing notation. 181 BBSt 7. 182 BBSt 25. 183 BBSt 30. The older MDP 2 95-96 (Kastiliasu IV), without reliefs, is rather in the form of a slab than a tablet and is engraved on only one side. 184 Frame 1986.</page><page sequence="42">42 J.A. BRINKMAN as sketched above. Royal land grants are attested as late as the eighth century,185 but non-royal or private transactions assume an increased prominence. The only new physical form to appear is the stone plaque, beginning in the middle of the ninth century and continuing down till almost the middle of the seventh century.186 We can try to match this picture of documentary evolution with what is known of the political history of the period, though such an attempt is in evitably speculative and undoubtedly premature. The end of the long-lived Kassite dynasty in the middle of the twelfth century closed a phase of strong central authority, which could grant land by royal fiat. The new Isin II Dynasty struggled for years to obtain a secure political footing; and, though it gained power in its champion Nebuchadnezzar I (1125-1104), who vanquished Elam, the monarchy and its authority eventually no longer seemed so strongly en trenched. Grantees now preferred their documentation of royal land grants backed not just by the authority of kingship, but also by the panoply of the law?transactions witnessed, sealed, and dated, drawing sanction from a source additional to the king. And beginning in the time of Marduk-n?din-ahh? (1099 1081), with the menace of Aramean invasions and other external threats to the land, almost all royal land grants began to follow the legal documentary tradi tion.187 This reliance on due form, added to the royal assent, continued until the end of the genre. And private or non-royal transactions came eventually to fol low the same pattern as well. 185 VAS 1 37 (Marduk-apla-iddina II). There is also a royal restoration of land in the sev enth century (BBSt 10, Samas-sumu-ukin) and another damaged text whose full subject mat ter is impossible to determine (Brinkman and Dalley 1988, Assur-n?din-sumi). 186 Earliest example: BBSt 36, Nab?-apla-iddina (contra Slanski, p. 156); latest example: BBSt 10, Samas-sumu-ukin. As noted above, Seidl does not accept "plaques" as a separate category. 187 The sole fully preserved exception of which I am aware is BE 1 149 (Marduk-ahh? er?ba, 1046 B.C.), for which see n. 180 above. About the time of Marduk-n?din-ahh?, BBSt 7 and the Caillou Michaux, both dealing with private transactions, similarly lack witnesses, sealing, and date; yet BBSt 8, BBSt 25, Lambert 1981, and al-Ad(a)mi 1982, all royal grants from the same reign, have both witnesses and date. It is also interesting that royal grants of tax exemption (zak?tu) recorded in this genre, which had begun in the time of Nazi-Maruttas (1307-1282), also ceased in the reign of Marduk-n?din-ahhe, just as the monarchy began to wane under increasing pressure from outside the land. But the evaluation of zak?tu at this time (studied in detail in Kraus 1968 for texts of this genre) must eventually include con sideration of other types of texts, such as the legal document Ni. 2885 (mentioning the zak?t nippur?ti, "freeing of the women of Nippur," promulgated by Sagarakti-Surias), Marduk z?kir-sumi I's grant of privileges to the citizens of Borsippa (RIMB 2 B.6.7.2), and B?l-ibni's favors bestowed on the inhabitants of the town of Sa-usur-Adad (RIMB 2 B.6.26.1); all three of these texts are concerned with zak?tu granted to large groups, not simply to individuals or workers in certain occupations, as is usually the case in kudurru/nar? texts.</page><page sequence="43">BABYLONIAN ROYAL LAND GRANTS 43 Though this is a rather myopic and superficial glance at a few aspects of this complex form of documentation, it attempts to view developments in chrono logical perspective. But we are inevitably aware of the thinness of our mater ial?the relatively small number of artifacts with complete or almost complete inscriptions?and our fleeting grasp of the political and social history of the age.
