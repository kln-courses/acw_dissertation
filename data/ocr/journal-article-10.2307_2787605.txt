When revising the proof-sheets of The Secret of the Totem in September 1905 I observed a statement by Mr. Howitt (Native Tribes of South-East Australia, pp. 499, 500) which appeared to me to be contradicted by his own evidence. Often as I read his pages I could understand them only in one way. I took him to mean that the belief in what he styles an "All-Father" only occurs among tribes in a forward stage of what we regard as social advance. But Mr. Howitt's own testimony proved that the belief exists among tribes who have not arrived at that stage. I therefore, in The Secret of the Totem and elsewhere, pointed out and criticised the apparent inconsistency. When I learned, from a paper by Mr. Howitt in Folk- Lore (July 1906), that he did not mean what to me (and to others) he seemed to mean, I publicly and privately apologised to Mr. Howitt for my misunderstanding, and I withdrew all my criticism based upon my error of apprehension. Mr. Howitt remains unsatisfied. He "would much like to be able to think that "I merely misunderstood his meaning as expressed in his summary." This implies that, when he wrote, Mr. Howitt did not regard my mistake as unconscious and involuntary. If that is, or was, or is to be, his opinion (I can never more feel sure that I understand what Mr. Howitt means), so be it. But I proceed to quote the entire passage which Mr. Howitt accuses me of garbling. I shall next try to show that the passage is, first, misleading in style, and, secondly, is erroneous, or shall I say inadequate ? in statement of facts. Mr. Howitt's remarks I copy, beginning at the last paragraph of Native Tribes of South-East Australia, p. 499: "It seems quite clear that Nurrundere, Nurelli, "Bunjil, Mungan-ngaua, Daramulun, and Baiame, all represent the same being under "different names. To this may be reasonably added Koin of the Lake Macquarie "tribes, Maamba, Birral, and Kohin of those on the Herbert River, thus extending "the range of this belief certainly over the whole of Victoria and of New South "Wales, up to the eastern boundaries of the tribes of the Darling River. If the "Queensland coast tribes are included, then the western boundaries might be indicated "by a line drawn from the mouth of the Murray River to Cardwell, including the "Great Dividing Range, with some of the fall inland (sic) in [New South Wales. "This would define the part of Australia in which a belief exists in an anthropo- "morphic supernatural being, who lives in the sky, and who is supposed to have "some kind of influence on the morals of the natives. No such belief seems to "obtain in the remainder of Australia, although there are indications of a belief in "anthropomorphic beings inhabiting the skyland. That part of Australia which I "have indicated as the habitat of tribes having that belief" [I take Mr. Howitt to mean the belief in a supernatural being with supposed moral influence], "is also the "area where there has been the advance from group marriage to individual marriage, "from descent in the female line to that in the male line; where the primitive "organisation under the class system has been more or less replaced by an organisation "based on locality; in fact, where those advances have been made to which I have "more than once drawn attention in this work." [ 102 ]</page><page sequence="2">1907.) MAN. [No. 62. This, I think, is the entire of the passage which, in The Secret of the Totem, pp. 197, 198, I treated in the following ternms: "I quote a passage from Mr. Howitt, " which Mr. Frazer restates in his own words (namely, in The Fortnightly Revietv, September 1905). " He defines 'the part of Auistralia in which a belief exists in an 'anthropomorphic supernatural being, who lives in the sky, and who is supposed to " 'have some kind of influence on the morals of the natives. That part " 'of Auistralia which I have indicated as the habitat of tribes having that belief' (namely, "certainly the whole of Victoria and of New South Wales up to the eastern bouindaries of the Darling ol River ") " is also the area where there has been the " 'advance from group marriage to individual marriage, from descent in the female "' line to that in the male line; where the primitive organisation under the class " 'system has been more or less replaced by an organisation based on locality-in fact, w'where those advances have been inade to which I have more than once drawn " ' attenitioni in this work."' The reader may now compare Mr. Howitt's twenty-seven lines with my attempt to condense them. If in that attempt I have wronged him it was done unwittingly. What I wanted to get at was the last sentence in his twenty-seven lines, beginnling " That part," and ending " in this work." It was here that (as I later learned with much regret) I misunderstood and misrepresented Mr. Howitt's ideas. I understood him to mean that all the tribes who, in the region defined, have- the All-Father belief, have also all advanced "from group marriage " to individual marriage, from descent in the female line to that in the male line; that the primitive organisation under the class system has been more or less replaced by an organisation based on locality, and so on, as above. If Mr. Howitt meant that (as I firmly believed he did), then his statement was contradicted by his evidence, which proves that tribes with female descent, and "primitive organisation under the class system," have the All-Father belief as much as the advanced tribes with male descent and local organisation. But Mr. Howitt did not meani that, and he has explained that the south-east natives without the All- Father belief are mainly those who practise what he calls " group marriages"; what I call Pirrauru and Pira?ungaru. As soon as I learned Mr. Howitt's real meaning I apologised, and withdrew all criticisms based on my error of apprehension. But, without his own explanation I could only understand his words as I did. I quote, for the first time, another passage of his which, without his explanation, would be to me equally misleading. Native Tribes, &amp;c., p. 506: " In the tribes of South-East Australia the ancestors appear in the guise of totems or theriomorphic human beings, in some respects resembling both " the Alcheringa ancestors and the Mura-Muras. But it must be remembered that in " these tribes there has been a clearly marked advance in the status of society, from " group nmarriage to a form of individual marriage, from descent in the female to " the male line, and from a society organised on the class systems to one based on " locality."* Mr. Howitt does not here really mean that among all these tribes there has been the advance to reckoning in the male line and to an organisation of society based on locality. He means that in some of these tribes the advances have been made. But he does not say that the advances have been made " in some of these tribes," he says that they have been made "in these tribes." Am I wrong in thinking this phrase misleading.? Again, Mr. Howitt writes: "; that part of Australia "-where the All-Father belief exists-" is also the area" where the social advances have been made. Now certain parts of "' that part of Australia" make one of the areas in which the social advances have been made; they are not the area of the advances. These advances have been M My italics.

The statement, therefore, of Mr. Howitt seems to me if not erroneous, at least quite inadequate. It also gives the impression that the All-Fatber belief co-exists with the social advances, whereas the advances are found in very large regions without the belief, and the belief is found in regions where two, at least, of the advances have not been made. With regard to Mr. Frazer, if he did not misunderstand Mr. Howitt's meaning in the same way as I did (and as a distinguished reviewer did, who "paraphrased Howitt, pp. 500-506 "), then I must regret haviing misunderstood him in precisely the same way as I misapprehended the ideas of Mr. Howitt. I find that 1 quoted Mr. Frazer thus (Secret of the Totem, p. 199-citing The Fortnightly Review, September 1905, p. 552), " Mr. Frazer puts the case thus, 'it can " ' hardly be an accidental coincidence that, as Dr. Howitt has well pointe(d out, the " 'same regions in which the germs of religion begin to appear have also made some 'progress towards a higher form of social and family life."' Now in Australia from the central Arunta to the northern sea, the advances to "individual marriage," to male descents, and to local organisation, have been made, but-where are the "germs of religion"? On the other hand, among many south-east tribes the advances to male descent and to local organisation have not been made, yet "'the germs of religion " (the All- Father belief) are flourishing there. There is a want of coincidence, whether accidental or essential, betweein the germs of religion anid the social advances. I am much honoured by Mr. Hlowitt's promised criticism upon numerouis passages in my book. I hope to profit greatly by his censures, and will gladly ackiiowledge ainy changes in my opinions which he may produce. But if he is not more successful in apprehending and stating my ideas than he was in a recent critique published by him elsewhere, I may take silence for the better part.
