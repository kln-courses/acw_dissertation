<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMERGING SCHOLARSHIP IN AFRICAN ART Challenges to Rural Festivals with the Return to * e Democratic Rule in Southeastern Nigeria ELI BENTOR he last fifteen years have seen a major shift in the study of African art. Beginning as a dis cipline largely devoted to the study of rural art forms in their reli gious and social con texts, it is now mainly focused on urban artists working as part of an increasingly globalized art world. This can be demon strated simply by looking at the program of the Triennial Symposium on African Art, the content of articles in African Arts, or the themes of research of most recent and current graduate students. At recent conferences, such as the 2004 Triennial Symposium on African Arts, there has been an increasing gulf between those scholars studying the recent urban arts and those who deal with rural artistic practices. More than a thematic or tempo ral division, it is a methodological one. While it seems natural to study urban arts in their political and global dimen sions, rural arts are still seen mainly as the products of a world that is insulated from national and international political and economic factors. The case can be made, however, for viewing rural artis tic practices not as part of the traditional past, but as part of the present. The re sponse of a contemporary rural festival in southeastern Nigeria to changes in the national scene provides an example. For the last 250 years, the Ikeji or New Yam festival, ostensibly a celebration of the yam harvest, has served as a com munal event bringing together the Aro people of southeastern Nigeria while al lowing for the renegotiation of status and access to political power by its subgroups (Bentor 1995). The Aro people, an amal gam of several Igbo, Jbibio, and Cross Riv er ethnic elements, first came together in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century to fight a war against a group of Ibibio people. They relied on the pow er of their famed oracle, the ibiniukpabi (or "Long Juju" as it was called by the British), located at the Aro base of Arochu kwu, to build a trading network through out the region. With the increasing demand for slaves, the Aro became the main slave dealers of the interior, exchanging slaves for imported commodities with coast al communities including Calabar, Bon ny, and later Opobo (Dike and Ekejiuba 1990:118-23). With the demise of the slave trade, the Aro used their slave-trading con tacts to establish a network of settlements throughout southeastern Nigeria special izing in the cultivation and trade of palm oil. As the nineteen villages that comprised Arochukwu built different spheres of trad ing partners and settlements, each village has had a distinct set of encounters with the different cultural and artistic zones of the very heterogenous cultural land scape of southeastern Nigeria (Cole and Aniakor 1984). In most Aro settlements, the Ikeji festi val serves to foster ties with Arochukwu and to distinguish the Aro from the in digenous peoples among whom they set tled. Arondizuogu in central Igboland is the largest Aro settlement. It comprises a small number of descendants of the original Aro settlers and a large number of their so-called dependents, who were brought here from the Anambra area to the north. Together the two groups ad justed the Aro Ikeji to reflect these new realities. While at Arochukwu the Ikeji is a harvest festival celebrating the new crop of yams around September, at Aron dizuogu the festival is held at the begin 38 african arts winter 2005</page><page sequence="2">ning of the farming season in April, the same season as the major festivals in i both central Igboland and the region to the north where the dependents came from. The prevailing genre of masking at Arondizuogu is the Mmanwu of the Anambra region (Fig. 2). Mmainwu is not found at Arochukwu. At Arochukwu, the original center of the Aro, the Ikeji is a complex event lasting twenty-three days. Each day of the Ikeji brings together different segments of the community in reenactments of different events of Aro history. On the culminating day of the festival, each of the nineteen vil lages that make up the polity of Arochu kwu performs a masquerade or a women's dance at the communal square. The inter nal administrative structure of Arochu kwu divides the community into four segments based on their respective areas of origin: two Igbo sections, one Ibibio, and the Akpa, whose origin is on the other side of the Cross River. Some of the mask ing genres at Arochukwu reflect these di verse origins. Additionally, each of the nineteen villages adopted different mask ing genres based on its trading contacts and its specific settlement area (Fig. 3). Standing at the communal square on that day, one can see masking genres from throughout southeastern Nigeria. The var ious genres of masks each village uses serve as markers of its specific historical experience (Fig. 1). Thus, the Aro come to celebrate their unity by demonstrating their diversity (Bentor 1995:169-206). In my earlier research, I demonstrated that the festival is more than just the arena for the reaffirmation of communal bonds. By foregrounding ties that hold the community together, the Aro Ikeji festival provides an opportunity for the different segments of Aro society to ad just their relative status and access to pow er (Bentor 1995:283-312). These precarious mechanisms are under severe stress as a result of the current political situation in Nigeria. Since independence, successive civil and military governments in Nigeria have 1.

Mma is typical of the north eastern part of Igboland and the neighboring Idoma people. The Arochukwu village of Amuvi has settlements in that area. Amuvi people adopted Mma masquerade. As many Aro set tlers in that area were displaces during the Nigerian Civil War, they brought Mma with them when they returned to Arochukwu.

Today there are thirty-six states and a Federal Capital Territory. Local Gov ernment Areas (LGAs, the equivalent of counties in the United States) often mul tiply and sometimes reunite with each passing regime. Yet, with all of Nigeria's volatility, the basic units of rural resi dence, known as Autonomous Com munities, remained relatively stable. In southeastem Nigeria, these are the obodo or village-groups, numbering from three to thirty villages with a combined pop ulation of several tens of thousands (Uzoigwe 2004). The obodo are the basic units of association in terms of person al identity, the answer to the question, "Where are you from?" While the claim of descent from a putative primordial an cestor of the entire community is often fictional and the sense of belonging to a local community and pattem of leader ship has evolved considerably during the colonial and postcolonial periods, the roots of these communities precede colo nial times (Harneit-Sievers in press:17-20). They were first recognized by the colo nial government based on intelligence reports compiled by District Officers in the 1930s (Jones 1988) and were later af firmed by colonial and later national and regional legislations governing tradi tional rulers and the formation of local governments (Stevens 1953; Harris 1957; Odenigwe 1971; Aborisade 1985). In east ern Nigeria, traditional festivals marking the harvest or the beginning of the farm ing season are often community-wide events that provide an opportunity for the reaffirmation of a sense of affiliation 40</page><page sequence="4">Opposite page Top: 2.

Following a succession of relatively sta ble military regimes, Nigeria retumed to democratic rule in May 1999. The Nigerian economy is heavily dependent on oil rev enues and the rural economy is largely stagnant. In the past, the federal govern ment would send some of its oil revenue to the states, who would in turn forward a little of it to LGAs-most of it dissipating along the way. One of the first steps of the democratically elected federal govern ment was to send monthly allocations di rectly to the elected chair of each LGA. This has changed, and since April 2003 local governments' allocations are depos ited into shared accounts with state gov ernments, which again withhold much of it. However, the amounts allocated to local governments have increased substantial ly. While in terms of the national budget the amounts are relatively small, in the impoverished rural areas, most Local Governments are dependent on these federal allocations (Ugwu 2000:9-10). As a result, control of local government and its budget has become more advantageous than ever before. Since decisions at the local government level are based on rep resentation by Autonomous Communities, for the first time there is strong pressure on Autonomous Communities to split, thereby multiplying and increasing their vote at the Local Government Council.' State governments in eastem Nigeria have approved the splitting of most Auton omous Communities into anywhere be | tween two and ten new Autonomous Communities, each with a recognized traditional ruler. While, by law, new Au tonomous Communities should reflect geographic and demographic realities, the ' power politics that underlie the style of Nigeria democracy often result in those splits reflecting the ability of communities and their leading citizens to gather their winter 2005 * african arts 41</page><page sequence="5">resources and gain influence with their state government. The pressure for the splitting of existing communities by cre ating new Autonomous Communities is done in the name of development and closer local control of resource allocations. However, the splitting is often the result of a desire on the part of economically successful members of the community to convert wealth into a "traditional" source of prestige and local political influence by acquiring titles as "traditional rulers" with their own Autonomous Communities. If, as I have argued, festivals often express and cultivate the tenuous binds that hold communities together, splitting an Auton omous Community puts a tremendous pressure on the communal celebration of the festival by the entire obodo. Arondizuogu, the largest Aro settle ment, was split into eight communities,2 separating for the first time the descen dants of the original Aro settlers from the descendants of their "dependents" who hail from the Anambra area to the north. Although there was a consensus that cre ating new communities could bring in development, the process of splitting up created some acrimony. As a result, the festival was scaled down for several years and was celebrated more at the village level, with fewer expressions of com munity-wide celebration. However, Ikeji Arondizuogu enjoys a great regional reputation for its vigorous masquerade performances and attracts visitors from throughout the region. Masquerade is the focus of attention of youth, who are the ones who could overcome those political differences, and after few years, the festi val seems to have resumed its grand scale as a celebration of the entire former obodo. A split in preferred masking genres, however, may begin to appear. The Aron dizuogu Ikeji festival is known through out the region as a bastion of Mmanwu, the masking genre of north central Igbo land (Figs. 5-6). This genre was brought in by the "dependents," whose main lead er, Iheme, came from Nise in present-day Anambra State. The newly established Au tonomous Communities of the dependents (Ndi-Iheme), now champion Mmanwu as representing their own "Anambra identi ty." Some descendants of the Aro settlers, Ndi-Izuogu, for their part have revived a dormant genre called Nwekpe (Ekpe),3 which they now advance as an original Aro genre rather than an introduced one (see Fig. 5 left). They have begun to refer to Nwekpe as the true "traditional dance" of the Aro-a claim never made before. This split of masking genres following the par tition of the community is only beginning to emerge and it remains to be seen how far it will go. At Arochukwu, the original Aro cen ter, pressures are mounting to split the community along the historical fissure lines dividing Igbo, Ibibio, and Akpa seg ments. The two other communities with whom Arochukwu shares their LGA (Ihechiowa and Ututu) have already split into eight Autonomous Communities each. Many people at Arochukwu are convinced that the community does not receive its share of government allo cations because they lack appropriate representation at the Local Government Council. Others are concerned about the social and cultural effects of a split. In an article titled "The Autonomous Com munity Blues" published in the internal Aro publication Aro News, Ndionyen ma Nwankwo warns about the conse quences of dividing the community and the loss of common identity. "What would happen to those cultural ties that span through different villages of Aro chukwu Kingdom?" (Nwankwo 2000:2). His prime example for such ties is the Ikeji festival. Thanks to Arochukwu's important place in the region's history, the tradition al ruler (the Eze Aro) has enjoyed a prominent position in the eyes of both colonial and postcolonial governments (Jones 1956:45; Ijoma 1986). So far, the Eze Aro has successfully resisted this pressure to split and the community is still nom inally united. However, tensions around the question of new Autonomous Com munities are mounting and the Ikeji festi val has become a very contentious time in recent years. While other aspects of the communal celebrations appear to contin ue, in the last several years several vil lages have limited their participation in the communal celebration on the culmi nating day. Many people at Arochukwu are lamenting the fact that Eke Ekpe, the culminating day that used to be a spec tacular display of unity through the ex hibition of a great variety of masking and dance genres of the various villages, has lost its brilliance. The struggle for control of Arochukwu led to some loss of control of the delicate orchestration of different masquerade genres and dances from dif ferent villages, which in turn led to some violent incidents at the peak of the festi val. One of the most favorite genres, the Ibibio Ekpo, known for its very virile and aggressive behavior, was even banned for several years (Figs. 6-7).4 Here again, the acrimony associated with the internal struggle to split the community to gain access to federal financial resources has posed a serious challenge for the celebra tion of the local festival. It appears that although Arondizuogu no longer exists as a unified Autonomous Community while Arochukwu has main tained its formal administrative unity, the impact on the two communities is perhaps the reverse of what might be expected. After a period of tension, Arondizuogu citizens seem to have overcome their dif ferences and the festival continues to be celebrated at the former obodo level. On the other hand, at Arochukwu, the con tinuous and prolonged struggle between those who favor division and those who attempt to preserve unity has led to the festival's relative decline. It remains to be seen how the changing political and eco nomic conditions in Nigeria will further contribute to the shaping of these rural festivals; however, this sketch should serve as an illustration of the importance of such factors not only for urban art but also to rural and "traditional" artis tic production. The reasons for the recent shift in scholarly interest to contemporary art, which I noted at the beginning of this essay, are not difficult to figure out. The sheer presence, aesthetic quality, and in ventiveness of contemporary artistic pro duction in Africa demanded scholarly attention. The move from "area studies" to "global studies" has turned scholar ly attention toward artists working with an awareness of the global art world. However, the shift also provided a solu tion to a growing discomfort about the state of the discipline. By the 1980s, many scholars voiced mounting criticism about the prevailing ahistorical mode of study ing African art (Kasfir 1984; Vansina 1984). These critics called for greater historical specificity in the study of African art as the study of change through time.5 However, given the nature of his torical evidence in sub-Saharan Africa, which is largely derived from oral tra ditions, attempts to reconstruct the pre colonial history of sub-Saharan African art proved a difficult task. My early stud ies of the Aro Ikeji festival in south eastern Nigeria, in which I attempted a reconstruction of the history of the festi val from at least the eighteenth century, attest to this (Bentor 1995). One way of getting at the right kind of documenta tion was to advance the justifiable claim for the inclusion of all parts of the conti nent, including North Africa and Egypt, in the study of African art and to use the much more conventional historical evi dence available there for such nuanced historical studies. However, this strategy does not provide a method for the study of precolonial history of Sub-Saharan Africa where conventional documenta tion is largely lacking.The other solution was to focus on the more recent colonial and postcolonial periods, where rich evi dence is more readily available. A few of these studies look at rural artistic tra ditions (Amoldi 1995; Strother 1997), but the majority focus on urban arts. While this new trend is beginning to yield ex 5.

The terms used for the other side of the equation are just as troublesome. With a century of what we call "modern art" (Art with a capital A) in Africa for us to study, to classify it all as "contemporary" certainly would not do. In a very real sense, the term "contemporary" is not valid since by the time we can talk about it as Art, it is already in the past. Outside Africa, "modernism" is juxtaposed with the "postmodern." A persuasive argument can be advanced that most recent art in Africa shares more with the Westem post modern than it does with the modern. However, can we have a Postmodem with out the Modem? I have largely opted to use here the terms "rural" and "urban" to emphasize that we are talking about two parallel | and interconnected realms linked in time but separated by space. However, even the terms "rural" and "urban" may not work in all situations. Freetown Ode-Lay urban masquerade (Nunley 1987) is a good illustration of the problematic of such a division, as are the gelede gangs terrorizing Lagos drivers today. Converse ly, the leading modem artistic movement in Nigeria known as the Nsukka School is based at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in a rural setting. Yet the Nsukka rural environment is clearly manifested in the characteristics of the Nsukka art school and clearly distinguishes it from other artistic centers in Nigeria. For in stance, the Yabba College of Technology in Lagos is associated with artists like Ulo Amoda, whose art has much more of an urban characteristic. "Rural" and "urban"' should thus be seen as Webberian ideal types.

Representation is actually by administrative wards that are based on autonomous communities. In addition to maneu vers to increase representation in the existing local govern ment, there is also a strong pressure to split LGAs and bring "democracy closer to the people." 2. A long-standing dispute within the family of Izuogu, the Aro founder of Arondizuogu, resulted in an earlier split formalized during a previous period of civilian rule. As a result, Ndiuche was carved out as an autonomous community in 1981. 3. Nw?kp? (literally son of ?kp?) is a different genre of mask ing from those used by the Ekpe secret society or the Ibibio Ekpo. See Nicklin and Salmons 1982. 4. These observations are preliminary. The impact of the cur rent political situation on the Ikeji of Arochukwu is the topic of my current (2005) research. 5. They, however, failed to provide clear examples of how such historical inquiry should proceed given the nature of oral evi dence and documentation common in the study of the African past. Vansina's ultimate example of the proper historical study of an African monument is the much more conventionally doc umented Great Mosque of Qairawan in Tunisia rather than his own studies of the Kuba people. Examples of a more sophisti cated historical inquiry in sub-Saharan Africa are largely limit ed to highly centralized societies where it is more common to find the kind of historical specificity that can shed light on artistic changes as part of larger social, political, demographic, or religious processes of change. Girshick Ben-Amos 1999, while somewhat speculative, offers a nuanced and detailed attempt at historicizing the study of the visual art of an African kingdom during the precolonial period. In noncentralized societies there does not seem to be the same degree of specific historical consciousness that would allow for similar detailed reconstruction of precolonial art history. 6. However, this terminology does demand the painful realiza tion that most of what we used to call "traditional African art" is in fact the product of the colonial and postcolonial periods.
