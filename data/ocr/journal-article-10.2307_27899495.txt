<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GOD OF SCIENCE. in reply to rev. henry collin minton. Among recent reviews of my works, a criticism of Fundamental Problems and The Surd of Metaphysics by Rev. Henry Collin Minton of Trenton, which appeared in The Princeton Theological Review, is distinguished by fairness and gives upon the whole a correct statement of my views ; yet it con tains at the same time a vigorous denunciation of my philosophy as atheistic and hostile to Christianity, if not to religion in general, I wish to submit the case to all who are inclined to agree with Mr. Minton for reconsideration, and, in order to let readers of The Monist judge for them selves, I take pleasure in reprinting his review in its entirety, and will limit my answer only to the most important point at issue?the objection of atheism. Mr. Minton overlooks the distinction made by me, between Determinism and Fatalism; he claims that I say "Man is dust and only dust; unto dust he need not return, for only dust he ever was." Obviously, Mr. Minton mixes me up (strange though it may seem) wTith Yahveh, the God of the</page><page sequence="2">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 459 ancient Hebrews, who utters a verdict to that purpose in Genesis iii, 19. Yahveh' says: "Dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return." Yahveh does not use the word "only," but he means it, and Ecclesiastes agrees with Yahveh's materialistic philosophy, which he states in shocking crudity (iii, 18-22), saying that "man hath no pre-eminence above a beast." I object to this one-sided view. I say that man, the human of man, is his soul, and man's soul is not of the earth earthy; while the body will turn to dust, the soul is not subject to decay.1 I have much to say on this subject, but I will drop all points of minor importance and limit my answer to our difference concerning the idea of God. Mr. Minton says: "The touchstone of any system of thought is to be "found in its attitude toward theism. Its teachings must have either a direct "or an indirect theological reference. Not that the philosopher must wait "with a 'By your leave' for the theologian ; but the theologian must find room "for himself within the pale of a philosophy, or he forthwith declines to "abide there." I agree with Mr. Minton that the God question is the touchstone of any system of thought. I further agree with him that the philosopher need not ask for a "By your leave" from the theologian, and I even agree that the theologian has the right to decline to "abide" within the pale of a philosophy which leaves no room for his God. He calls my philosophy "pretentious," and I will not quarrel with him on points of etiquette, for theologians have the advantage. They can afford to be modest and yet be positive, because they proclaim, not their own private views, but the truth of God. Mr. Minton should consider that I can turn the tables on him. The case can be viewed from the opposite standpoint. The philosopher investigates theologies, and he tries whether he can find room in any one of them for his philosophy. When I compare notes with a theologian I am above all inter ested in his God-conception, and, if his God-conception gives to science what is of science, I shall be glad to abide with him. Judging from Mr. Minton's comments, I fear that his God belongs to the old-fashioned circle of deities whose dwelling-place is in darkness and who cannot stand the light of science. If he worship the God who needs nescience in order to have at all a right to existence, I am not specially pained if he prefers to part company. But we may, after all, find some common ground, if his God be (as I am convinced he is) the God of Protestantism, a God that lives in light, a God of truth, not only of the truth of sentiment, but also of the truth of science ; further, of righteousness, of good will and lovingkindness, not only in questions of charity, in taking care of the sick, and preaching the doctrine of love, but also in our actual *Sec my article, "The Ascent of Man," in the March number of The Open Court.</page><page sequence="3">460 THE MONIST. intercourse with the people who differ from us in opinion, even if they are infidel philosophers. The fact is that more than thirty years ago I was in exactly the same place in which Mr. Minton is now. I can understand him, but he does not understand me. I know his God-conception in all details, for it was my own belief when I was either at his age or at least at his stage of mental develop ment. I have given up that God-conception not by any perversity of heart or any objection to Christianity. Nor did I surrender my faith rashly. On the contrary, I gave it up reluctantly and against my will. When I gave up my belief in God, in that individual divine monarch who performed miracles and listened to the prayers of his humble worshipers, all my hopes and moral convictions were so intimately intertwined with my lost belief that my entire religious world broke to pieces and I felt all the horrors of perdition on account of the unbelief to which I had fallen a prey. It was only after years of groping after the truth that I regained my mental equilibrium and that I found again truth in the faith of my childhood if I were only permitted to interpret the dogmas in a symbolical sense. I have ever since tried to see how religious convictions might be adapted to scientific truth, not by compromise, but by a frank surrender of error, and the result was that I formulated a God-conception that is unequivocally tenable on scientific grounds. If Mr. Minton, for the sake of his religion, extends no welcome to my philosophy (or, more correctly stated, to the philosophy of science, for personalities have nothing to do with the case) it is certainly not the latter (the philosophy of science), but only the former (his religion) which in the long run will have to suffer ; for (to repeat a sentence of mine, which Mr. Minton disapprovingly quotes), "The religion which opposes science is doomed." I have lost the God of my childhood and I have become, in the opinion of those who still believe as I did then, an atheist, but the more I think about the God-problem, the surer grows my conviction that the God of science is the true God, and the God of mediaeval theologians is a mere makeshift, a substitution for the true God, a temporary surrogate of God, a surrogate which at the time, was good enough for immature minds, but too often only led people astray. The God of heresy trials and witch persecutions is not the true God, and the theology of the inquisition is a sad aberration, whatever its pretensions and claims of Catholicity may be. Gods will be tried as much as mortals, and they should be judged according to their deeds. Compare the God of miracle and special revelation with the superpersonal God of science whose cause is identical with truth, with righteousness and justice, and then make your choice. Mr. Minton claims that in my philosophy "every impulse of the modern philosophical spirit crying out for the ultimate personality is ignored and</page><page sequence="4">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 461 repulsed." The term "ultimate personality" is not fortunate, but I will not haggle about words, whenever I have good reasons to know the meaning ; and so I answer that his statement is not true, in so far as I have myself decidedly advocated the justice of speaking of God as a person, only I insist that God's personality is not human, but divine. God's thoughts are not transient successive representations, but eternal verities, some of which are formulated by naturalists as laws of nature. God's thoughts are everlasting and omnipresent, being all-efficient in every instant. When we consider that actual events in the world shape themselves according to their regulations, we must grant that they prove omnipotent. In so far as they are perfect in every respect, they may be called all-wise, although the term implies a gross anthropomorphism. They are not wise in a human sense; they are all-wise, being the standard of all wisdom. Since nothing escapes the omnipresence of God, they may be characterized as omniscient. Yet here, again, they are not omniscient in a human sense, but in a higher sense, penetrating into the most secret recesses of existence. Finally, in so far as they justify truth, goodness and right, if not at once, yet in the long run, we may call them all-good, omni-benevolent, omni-beneficent, and, at any rate, they are the ultimate standard of morality. Such has been the nature of God, since in the evolution of religion God was identified with justice and righteousness. I am far from denying or ignoring the desire to think of God under the allegory of a person. I only remain conscious of the fact that it is a simile. Further, it is important to stand in a personal relation to God, to bear in mind that He is the God of the whole world and also of me individually; but I am at the same time aware of the child like confusion which frequently prevails in the God-conceptions of pious souls. If their piety keeps in proper limits and does not ascend the tribunal of the inquisition, their erroneous views are not only harmless, but may be regarded as a surrogate of the genuine piety which has grasped the true nature of a truly divine God. It is not fair to say that I propose to "smash the shrines of all creeds" or "to throttle the very instinct of religion in man;" for, on the contrary, I see in religion the deepest and most important impulse of man's humanity. My criticism of the errors of religion in its lower phases does not blind me to the enormous significance of all religious aspiration, and I am glad to recognize the goodness of the religious instinct even where it is still obscured by superstitions and idolatrous practices. In my opinion, it is the duty of the philosopher to judge every religion according to the best interpretation that its best representatives have given it. Aberrations should not be con cealed, but the motive of the aberration should be explained without personal disparagement. Mr. Minton characterizes my God-conception as "pantheism robbed of</page><page sequence="5">462 THE MONIST. its mystical adornments and its confessedly somewhat redeeming features." Pantheism identifies God and the world to such an extent that God is the sum-total of all being. I object to pantheism because God is not the sum total of all things in the world; God is the cosmic order, the entirety of the factors that shape the world. Accordingly, God is not the All, the totality of nature, but a definite feature of the world. God as the cosmic order, it is true, is everywhere in the world, but he is not the material world itself. God is not the whole, but a part of the world, and here the old paradox becomes true, that the part is more than the whole. The determinate factors of the world, the eternal norm of being, the divine in the real, is so much more real, so much better, so much more powerful, than any and all single realities, that it exists independently of nature and would remain, even if the whole world did not exist?a truth which justifies the term "super natural." God is the super-real in the real, the hyperphysical in the physical, and the supernatural in the natural. Yet the supernatural is not anti-natural, nor is it extra-natural ; it is present in the natural ; it lies latent in the lower spheres of the inorganic world and becomes apparent in the soul of man. The fundamental difference between Mr. Minton and myself is this : He believes in a personal and I in a superpersonal God, and to him the super personal God is impersonal. Mr. Minton does not call me an atheist, but other theologians have done so, and I will freely grant that in so far (but in so far only) as a truly superpersonal God makes the personal God redundant, my philosophy will naturally appear to many as atheism, because it antagonizes or renders antiquated the old-fashioned theology of a personal (i. e., an individual) God. But the man of science will understand that the idea of a superpersonal God is tenable before the tribunal of the severest critique, and so my God conception will finally be considered as a higher theism, truer, more scientific, and more genuine than the old belief, if only we agree to be serious in the purification of the God idea, if only we mean to think of God as a truly divine being, if only we are serious in looking upon him as truly eternal, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipo tent, etc. The theologians of the past have never been serious in think ing out these qualities of God to their very last conclusion. They have illustrated them with a childlike na?vet? and made of God, instead of a divine person, an enormously huge human person, a deified individual, an Ego entity, with all its weaknesses, retaining the most human features of the simile and rejecting its truly religious meaning. Now, I will confess to Mr. Minton and to all theologians who may care to know, that in my theological development I actually passed through an era of unequivocal and avowed atheism. I turned atheist, when I understood that law is supreme and must be supreme, that the highest authority in matters of truth and morality are not verdicts of an individual being, be</page><page sequence="6">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 463 it ever so huge and powerful, but that they are eternal and unalterable norms. Nothing can be more eternal than eternal law. Principle is above any deity, truth is higher than any God, and if there is anything divine at all, truth constitutes the very essence of divinity. Says Esdras (1 Esdras, iv, 35) : "Great is the truth and stronger than all things." The book is apocryphal, but the glorification of the truth which it contains is worthy of being quoted in full. Esdras says (1 Esdras, iv, 38-40) : "As for the truth, it endureth, and is always strong; it liveth and con "quereth for-evermore. "With her there is no acceptance of persons or rewards; but she doeth 'the things that are just, and refraineth from all unjust and wicked things; "and all men do well like of her works. "Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, "kingdom, power and majesty- of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth." The question is not whether or not my God is a personal being, but whether or not my God is the God of Truth. I will boil down the God problem to the simplest possible statement, and if Mr. M?nton will be kind enough to criticise my atheism and correct me where I am wrong, I will be glad to revert to the old theological anthropo morphism. Uniformities of our experience which naturalists formulate as natural laws are ultimately reduced to principles of the formal sciences, logic, arithmetic, mathematics, etc. We will select the simplest of all, arithmetic, and take as an instance the simplest statement, 2X2 = 4. This statement is typical of all other purely formal statements in all the purely formal sciences. We might as well take any complicated equation, for instance, the formula of the Newtonian law of attraction or the result of calculations by which we predict with great precision the movements of the celestial bodies, or events in physics, or the result of any natural process. All formulas of scientific certainty, if correctly stated, are finally just as intrinsically necessary as the equation 2X2 = 4. Now this statement is intrinsically true, and so are all the conclusions of all the purely formal sciences, and since the purely formal features are the determining factors in the laws of nature, the laws of nature themselves are of the same intrinsic necessity. Such as they are, they are immutable ; they must be so, and cannot be otherwise, and we can understand that if certain features of reality are given, the consequences are definitely determined, and cannot be otherwise. Scientific comprehension really con sists in formulating experiences as uniformities and pointing out their necessity. Now the question is?Has this equation, 2X2 = 4, been made such as it is by a God or is it intrinsically necessary? If it (and with it the entire cosmic order) has been made by a God, then God is superior to the formula.</page><page sequence="7">464 THE MONIST. If, however, God, the Creator, when about to create the world, considered the intrinsic necessity of formal laws and like a master-inventor adapted His plans of construction to eternal and immutable norms, He is no longer supreme, but is subject to some higher power, the eternal necessity of law. Plato's God is not God in our sense. Plato speaks of necessity as above God. Plato's God is the Demiurgos, the master-builder of the world. Further, Brahma, the God of the Brahmans, is the world-soul; and the world-soul, too, is subject to eternal law. The world-soul (as conceived by the Brahmans) is a great and noble creature. It is as much bigger and higher, and, perhaps, also, as much better, than man as perhaps man is superior to an ant, or even to a microbe, or to a white blood corpuscle that courses in his veins ; but, after all, the world-soul is not truly God, but an individual being, a creature of the true God ; and the principles of truth and goodness and justice are his norms as much, and not a whit less, than they are the norms of man. I for one cannot conceive that God made 2X2 = 4, or any other purely formal statement. The harmony of mathe matics is not extraneous, but intrinsic, and there is no room for an individual lawgiver who made the laws, such as they are, eternal and necessary. Having been told from my childhood that all other God-conceptions save the traditional interpretation of Biblical theology are atheistic, I jumped to the conclusion that theism is wrong and that atheism is right and, pre ferring truth even to the faith of my childhood, which was very dear to me, I discarded religion and turned infidel. I thought at the time that I was irreligious, but I know now, from expe rience, that all infidelity is only a phase in our religious development. Ingersoll was the son of a clergyman, and there was more of his father in him than he knew himself. He was a born clergyman, and all his scoffing, his blasphemy, and flippant jokes about things sacred are evidences of his deep interest in theological questions. The disappointment of our expecta tions naturally turns our love into hatred, our infatuation into spite, our disappointed hopes into bitter denunciations. The historians of a later age will give Ingersoll a place in the development of theology, and will give him more credit and more honor as a theologian than the leaders of our orthodox churches of the present day are inclined to allow. I remained an atheist so long as I felt merely the need for a negation of errors; but very soon I began to yearn for a positive statement of my con victions, and I tried to construct a new world conception out of the d?bris of the shipwreck which my religion had suffered. When I inquired into the scientific explanations of the universe, and when I investigated the nature of the moral problem, I found that what I had attributed formerly to an individual being, a great cosmic monarch, or a purpose-endowed world-scul, was actually accomplished in a much grander and a more unfailing way</page><page sequence="8">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. by natural law ; and natural law is not the mere formula of the naturalist, but a living factor, an omnipresent power that although unmaterial, rules supreme everywhere in exactly the same manner which must be attributed to God if the conception of God's nature be freed from gross anthropomorphism. Moreover, all the natural laws form one great system of an intrinsic and organic unity?a kind of spiritual organism, and we may in this sense call it a person, only we must understand that this person is not an individual, not a person in the human sense, but the omnipresence of efficient law. It is the norm of being, which, when it illumines the consciousness of sentient beings, through the development of reason, constitutes their per sonality. There is a standard of right and wrong, of good and evil, of truth and falsehood there is an objective condition in the constitution of the world that makes man possible as a rational and a moral being. What ever it may be, that is God. Thus I had found God again, yet God is to me no longer a particular and concrete reality, but the super-reality of universal and eternal efficiency. Here is an undeniable factor possessed of all the qualities formerly attributed to God, doing all the functions of God and serving at the same time in the broadest way as the ultimate authority in the field of conduct. Here is the prototype of man's personality; for human reason is nothing but the reflex of the cosmic order?the rationality of the universe. Here alone is the standard of truth and untruth, of right and wrong, of goodness and badness ; and when I became confronted with the claims of wrong liberalism rejecting all authority in science as well as ethics; when I considered the claims of Mr. Spencer's agnosticism, that the ultimate mystery of the world is absolutely inscrutable, that accordingly in ethics hedonism rules supreme; that there is no good and evil in the moral sense of the word, but that good is merely that which yields most pleasure, I found that in these essential points?in points relating to conduct?agnosticism is wrong and that the traditional religion is right. We have only to mind that the traditional view is expressed in poetical terms. Mr. Minton calls me a pagan, but whether or not he is right depends upon the meaning of the name. The word, according to its etymology, means "villagers," "country folks," or "people that live in the heath." Hence, the Saxon term, "heathen." The pagan is contrasted to the inhabitant of the city, the "urban." The latter is supposed to be urbane and progressive, but the former is considered a boor, a hayseed, a reactionary conservative. While the urban population had adopted the new faith (Christianity) the pagan still clung to his belief in the ancient gods, and thus pagan came to mean a worshiper of any one of the pre-Christian religions. To-day the word "pagan" is used in different senses. Some Christians (especially those that are inclined to be dogmatic) call pagans all non</page><page sequence="9">466 THE MONIST. Christians, fetich-worshipers as well as philosophers. This makes not only the cannibals pagans, but also the ancient Greeks and Romans, the large masses of the Chinese, the Japanese, the Siamese, and the Hindus, including all non-Christian sages, Socrates and Plato, and Buddha. It seems unfair to use the word "pagan" promiscuously for Plato as well as the idolator, and I propose to use the word "pagan" for all those who are so backward in their religious development that they still believe in the letter of their religious myth instead of accepting the spirit of it. If Plato speaks of Zeus, he does not mean merely the personification of the sky, but God, almost in a Christian sense. However, the idolator who kneels before a Zeus statue and believes that it is the residing place of a spirit called Zeus, is a pagan, and it becomes apparent that if the word "pagan" is used in this sense, that while Socrates and Plato cannot be called pagans, there is much paganism still left in Christianity, not only in Italy and other Catholic countries, where saint-worship bears a strong resemblance to the ancient polytheism, but sometimes even in Protestant countries, where the God-conception in many minds is by no means free from crude anthro pomorphic conceptions. It is pagan to think of God as a great benevolent man seated on a throne in the heavens; it is pagan when the dogmas of the symbolical books are believed literally, and not in a symbolical sense; it is pagan to kneel before an icon and expect help through a worship of it. The dogmatic Christian looks with contempt upon pagan mythology, without being aware that there is also a Christian mythology, and, as a rule, those Christians who call dissenters infidels and pagans are pagans themselves; the Christian pagan, however, is more ingenuous than the pagans of Greek and Roman antiquity, for the latter were mostly con scious of the mythological nature of their gods, while the dogmatic Christian of to-day is still a believer in the letter of his mythology. When I became aware of the truth that the essential part of a religion, a philosophy, a world-conception, is that feature which determines its ethics, which finds practical application in conduct, I found myself necessitated to revise my atheism, and now I discovered that the very arguments which had upset my belief in an anthropomorphic deity, furnish the most solid foundation for a truer and nobler and better God-conception. Having regained a positive ground, I learned to judge the situation objectively, and I came to the conclusion that my views are the legitimate outcome of a consistent further development of the faith of my childhood, and I have no doubt that Mr. Minton himself, or his sons and his disciples, will by and by reach the position in which I stand to-day. I am fully aware of my kinship to former stages of my religious development, and since then whenever I feel an Ingersollian irony come over me, I am con scious of its being the criticism of my own prior self.</page><page sequence="10">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 467 Far from being averse to religion, I love it, and am deeply interested in it. Other religions that are kin to Christianity, especially the old original Buddhism, and the pure teachings of Lao-Tze, are naturally sympathetic to me, but Evangelical theology takes the place of a direct spiritual ancestry. It seems as if Mr. Minton had noticed the special regard I pay to it, but he views my consideration of it not without distrust, for he says of my philosophy that: "It regards with patient and patronizing complacency the crude anthro pomorphisms and excrescences of mankind's present religious state, remem bering that mythology is ever an indispensable ladder to be climbed in "making the difficult ascent to truth." Replace the words "patient and patronizing complacency" by "sympathy" and I will make no objection to Mr. Minton's statement. There is a peculiar charm in the God-conception. These three letters, G-O-D, are a treasure of uncommon riches. They embody all that is great, and noble, and good, and right, and true. It is one of my greatest efforts in life to preserve this grand idea from the shipwreck which Christian paganism (the dogmatic belief in the letter) is bound to incur. To those who call me an atheist, I answer that I am not a common atheist; I am an atheist who loves God. But, after a careful inquiry into the problems of the nature of God and the history of the God-conception, I have come to the conclusion that my philosophy is not atheistic. A German scholar writes in a German encyclopedia: "The conceptions concerning God are very different, and there are many "who denounce as atheism every view which differs from their own." How true is this statement ! It may be applied to both my opponents and myself. Mr. Minton calls me "a twentieth century pagan" because I do not believe as he does, and I call him "a Christian pagan" because he believes in the letter of a dogma which was originally not meant to be taken literally, for it was proclaimed as "a symbol," being contained in the collection of Christian credos, officially called "symbolical books." The more I ponder oh the God-problem, the surer grows my conviction that the God of science, the God whose existence no atheist could deny, whose reality cannot be doubted by anyone who has once understood its significance, is not less in power, and dignity, and divinity, than the old god of dogmatism, but the highest God that any system of thought has ever had any cognizance of, and no one who has grasped the idea of divinity, or ever took it seriously, will deny that the old God is a mere makeshift in default of man's capacity of comprehending the true divinity that sways the universe, gods and god-conceptions, and men, the starry systems, suns and planets, mites and motes, the infinite expanse of the extended milky way, with probably other worlds beyond, and the most intimate commotions in the hearts of sentient beings.</page><page sequence="11">4?8 THE MONIST. Mr. Minton takes me to task that my God does not stand in need of adoration, and that I condemn adoration as a pagan custom. All depends upon the meaning of the word. "Adoration" is derived from the Latin "os" = "mouth," and means throwing a hand-kiss to a person or deity to whom one is devoted. The usual attitude of pre-Christian pagans before their gods, as represented on the monuments, is with the fingers of the right hand on their lips. I have no objection to lip service of any kind, nor to any form of dignified adoration, but we should not encourage self-humiliating ceremonies. Relig ion should elevate man, not degrade him, and so I have no room for any God who enjoys the spectacle of prostrate and kneeling worshipers. Remember that even earthly monarchs, if they become civilized, are dis gusted with the kowtowing of their subjects. My view of worship is, briefly stated, this: If worship is taken in the usual sense as an act of submissive flattery, I do not propose to worship God. However, if worship is to signify, what it does according to its etymology (Anglo-Saxon weordhscipe), "considering and bearing in mind the worth of something or somebody," I do propose to worthship God. All of us should fully appreciate the import of God, for our lives and for those who shall live after us. Such a worship is one "in spirit and in truth," as is commended by Christ. It will keep us in harmony with humanity as well as with the cosmical order of the universe. It will not disparage but elevate man as the first-born son of nature and the legitimate child of God. The same holds good of prayer. Supplication, with kneeling down in abject self-humiliation, should be discontinued. But if prayer is a severe self-criticism, a moral atonement for trespasses committed, and also a vow to do better in the future, a strengthening of our moral sense for avoiding errors, if prayer thus keeps us in unity with God, the eternal standard of morality, prayer is recommendable. There is no sense in praying for rain, or for the abatement of a storm, or for a change in the course of nature. If we do so, our prayer may prove an alleviation to our troubled mind, but it will have no effect upon nature, for the laws of nature are immutable. Nor is there any sense in trying to alter God's will; but there is sense in praying for a change in our own will, a change of our attitude in life, of our own mental and moral disposition, and this is not only recommendable, but highly desirable even from the standpoint of science. Man can only gain by the establish ment of a personal relation to the divine will, meaning by it the moral demands made of man by the cosmic order. Our hearts are sanctified by a devotional attitude toward that all-presence which we have defined as true divinity. If this personal relation finds expression in words it will assume the form of vows, of self-exhortation, of praying for the power of</page><page sequence="12">CRITICISMS AND DISCUSSIONS. 469 resistance in temptation, for strength and energy when great tasks confront us, for fortitude in misfortune, for patience and submission to the inevitable ills of life. There is but one true worship, which consists, as Christ declares, in doing the will of God, and there is but one prayer that is not heathenish, the Lord's Prayer, "Thy will be done," for it is not a beggar's petition but a vow of self-discipline. Finally, there is but one religion ; it is the spread of good will upon earth, yet it cannot be realized without an uncompromising sub mission to truth. Let us by all means respect the symbols in, with, and under which religious truths are taught; but the significance of a creed is more than its symbols; the meaning is greater than the dogma; the spirit is higher than the letter.
