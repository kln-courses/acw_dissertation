<plain_text><page sequence="1">Re-Writing America: Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's The Professor's House IAN F. A. BELL University of Keele On Christmas Day, the beginning of Christian history, Godfrey St Peter, himself born near the northern border of the United States of mixed stock ('Canadian-French on one side, and American farmers on the other'), who looks like a Spaniard and creates a French garden on land he rents from a German landlord, asks an odd question about origin of Augusta, German in genealogy and venerably Latin in name, on her return from Mass: 'That passage in the service about the Mystical Rose, Lily of Zion, Tower of Ivory - is that the Magnificat?'.1 St Peter, professionally engaged in deciphering beginnings, emotionally committed to ideas of originatory purity, ought to know better. Not only does he seem unaware of the Magnificat as the first writing of the nativity, but he misapplies his passage from another text, the 'Litany of the Blessed Virgin', better known as the 'Litany of Loreto', and he seems to misremember its main catalogue of symbols (the Litany has the 'Tower of David,' not the 'Lily of Zion'). Nevertheless, he remains fascinated by the idea of the Magnificat as a celebration of a vital beginning which is composed by a female (PH, p. Ioo). The oddity and the errors of St Peter's question resonate throughout this novel powerfully concerned with con- temporary interests in origins, and represented within a complex apprehen- sion of the female. In keeping with Williams's In the American Grain (1925) and Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1926), The Professor's House vividly engages the period's concern with the political control of what were perceived as the 'alien' communities in America: immigrants and native Indians. Cather wrote The Professor's House in 1924, the year of the Johnson Immigration Act (which established a strict quota for foreign entry) and the Indian Citizenship Act (which, following on from the Dawes Act of 1887, granted full citizenship to the Indian population). As Lesley J. Vaughan has noted in the most up-to-date commentary on the issue, 'at stake in the debates over immigra- tion and assimilation was the centrality of ethnicity to American identity itself',2 and in a recent, dazzling, reading of the novel through the immigra- tion debate, Walter Benn Michaels sees how the concern with immigration 1 Willa Cather, The Professor's House (London: Virago, 1981), pp. 12-14, 99 (hereafter cited as PH). 2 'Cosmopolitanism, Ethnicity and American Identity: Randolph Bourne's "Trans-National America"', Journal of American Studies, 25 (I991), 443-59 (P- 444) The standard study of American immigration and its relations with issues of ethnicity remains John Higham, Strangers in the Land: Patterns ofAmerican Nativism 1860-1925 (New York: Atheneum, I97i).</page><page sequence="2">IAN F.

BELL 13 reinvigorates that perennial question 'What is an American?' and notates 'the newly official interest in everybody's ancestors'.3 During the period following the Civil War, and in particular after the turn of the century, the extraordinary increase in immigration became one of the major issues of domestic politics.4 Although in the main an issue for the large eastern seaboard cities, Willa Cather's Nebraska was not immune to the influx. By 1883 when the Cather family moved to Red Cloud, 'native-born Americans were in the minority',s and Cather herself chose to recall its ethnic diversity in an article of 1923, immediately prior to the composition of The Professor's House.6 The problems of diversity and assimilation applied also to that other group of American 'aliens', the Indians. Here, the I92Os marked important shifts in attitude. The Indians presented a different sort of threat to native white stock in that they were organized as communities and held land as tribes: a double threat of collectivity and ownership which has been well summarized by David Murray as a harmony between the land and its inhabitants .7 Such harmony is a principal feature of the culture of the Mesa Verde for both Tom Outland and Cather herself (in her record of her visit in 1916), and provides a telling site for the novel's negotiations of community and individualism, of public and private responsibilities, through the urge for the purity of origin. The Dawes Act strove to assimilate the Indians within the hegemony of white Anglo-American conformity, and depended upon the need to fragment communal consciousness: Theodore Roosevelt, in his 1901 State of the Union message, saw the Act as a 'mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass'.8 But the ascendancy of interest in the possibilities of cultural pluralism amongst intellectuals after the turn of the century occasioned a revaluation of Indian cultural life which admired rather than despised the collectivity of its harmony. This organicist approach found its official voice in the Meriam Report of 1928 which substantially revised cultural perceptions of the Indians. In the thinking of figures such as John Collier (an active supporter of Indian groups during the I92os, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1934), the harmony of Indian culture provided the ameliatory antidote to, in Murray's words, 'the atomized and commercial society he saw around him', and as a model for integrating public and private spheres, 'an example of how to survive by community rather than be destroyed by individualist competition'.9 In his 3 'The Vanishing American', American Literary History, 2 (1990), 220-41 (P. 221). 4 Vaughan, p. 447. 5 Philip Gerber, Willa Cather (Boston: Twayne, 1975), P. 21. 6 Quoted in Hermione Lee, Willa Cather: A Life Saved Up (London: Virago, 1989), P- 33. 7 David Murray, Modern Indians (Durham: British Assocition for American Studies, 1982), p. 12.

Crevecoeur had answered his famous question of I782 along similar integra- tive lines,11 and five years later, the more constitutionalist bent ofJohnJay in The Federalist repressed the ethnic diversity acknowledged by Crivecoeur to assert the political unity of the new republic on the grounds that 'this country and this people seem to have been made for each other'.12 Despite their differences in impulse, the play by both Crivecoeur and Jay of place and social life, of soil and institutions at these key moments in the formation of America itself, establishes the terms of the debate which continued well into the twentieth century, and display the contradictions of the debate which so concern Cather's text: that is, while the social definitions of identity (through religion, institutions, and principles of government) depend upon a sense of active choice, of re-making the world, the argument for place, for natural harmony, is essentially inactive, and may be seen as anaesthetizing the effort towards choice. Place rather than societal structures seems to be of more immediate interest to Cather in her diagnosis of the urge towards origin and identity in The Professor's House. She met D. H. Lawrence in 1924, the year of its composition and the year after Studies in Classic American Literature was published.13 In an earlier essay of 1920, 'America, Listen to Your Own', Lawrence had already established 'the aboriginal life of the continent' as the proper concern for American history and its role in establishing national identity.14 William Carlos Williams's In the American Grain of 1925 attempted to excavate the authentic language of that identity,15 and Lawrence's review of 1926 was sensitive to the newly figured 'spirit of place' in Williams's enterprise. American history here becomes a history of 'Americanization'. This new history is above all a history of process rather than achievement where 'a man, in America, can only begin to be American'. In clear distinction to the definitions which echo from Crivecoeur and Jay onwards, Lawrence recognizes the 'spirit of place' as part of the adventure, of the process of creating and becoming at a time when 'all America is now going hundred per cent American'. His qualification here strikes at a major 10 Quoted in Murray, p. 15. '1J.

BELL 15 anxiety of The Professor's House: 'But the only hundred per cent American is the Red Indian, and he can only be canonized when he is finally dead.'16 Purity is available only at the expense of death - the wiping out of the original inhabitants of the cliff city or the demise of Tom Outland: St Peter is obliged to experience the death of loss in his surrender of what Lawrence called 'the unexpressed spirit of America' in 1923.17 It is their extinction which renders the cliff dwellers as a site for origin within the mythologizing idealism of Outland and St Peter. The Indians matter not so much as figures for an indigenous and authentic America (although such features are inevitably invoked): they matter because they are wholly beyond the reach (and infection) of contemporaneity18- the stubborn blindness of the Smith- sonian, the supersession of 'purely cultural studies' by 'commercial studies' as the university becomes directed towards the function of a 'trade school' (PH, p. I40), or what is percieved as the mess of foreignness imaged through that other house, the European furnishings of Louie Marsellus. Tom Outland's 'Story' is about origin and about the impulse for origin. The terms of that story and of St Peter's need for its telling are what preoccupy The Professor's House. The dream of origin is what simultaneously fascinates and repels the novel. Textually, the sheer force of Outland's 'Story' tends to suppress 'The Family' and 'The Professor' sections, and the potency of its idealistic imaginativeness encourages a forgetfulness of the conditions which prompted its shape in the first place. Such suppression is more clearly seen in that other product of Outland's mind: the theory for the engine developed by Marsellus, the patent which Kathleen, who has already appropriated 'Tom's mesa' as 'entirely my own' (PH, p. 131), sees as turning Outland into a figure for others, a figure of'chemicals and dollars and cents' (PH, p. I32). While 'chemicals and dollars and cents' are seen to have no significance for the removed and preserved world of the mesa, they are extremely important for the material world which constitutes the rest of the novel, a world which, although possessive and greedy, is the one in which people suffer. Robert Crane shares the removed idealism of Outland and St Peter, resisting the 'new commercialism' that was 'undermining and vul- garizing education' (PH, p. 140) and engaged in theoretical rather than applied research 'determining the extent of space' (PH, p. 141). He contrib- uted substantially to the working out of Outland's theory which remained as 'a formula written out on paper' for two years (PH, p. 138), well removed from its practical and commercial development. All the plainness, dreari- ness, and impecunity of the Crane family (PH, pp. 134-42) registers that which is left behind by the beauty of Outland's imagination. While Crane's abstractions lead to poverty and ugliness, Outland's produce wealth and 16 D. H. Lawrence, 'American Heroes,' repr. in Phoenix, pp. 92-93- 17 D. H.

And glamour is the feature that is insisted upon here: the grotesque character of Crane's mouth, his 'most conspicuous feature' (PH, p. 144) is allowed a greater force than the cavalierly 'careless procedure' of Outland's laboratory technique (PH, p. 146). St Peter is understandably depressed by Crane's material discomfort, but he chooses to engage in a further act of suppression in accommodating himself to it. He chooses to ignore the fact that it is indeed a matter of 'chemicals and dollars and cents', preferring instead to see it as an expres- sion of a pecuniary corruption of integrity having already refused the 'social' bond of the Outland money on his own behalf (PH, p. 62) and securing solace in the axiomatic phrasing of an earlier text formed through the mouth of Outland: 'If Outland were here tonight, he might say with Mark Antony, My fortunes have corrupted honest men' (PH, p. 150).19 St Peter is fond of earlier texts and, as his conversation with Augusta about the Magnificat shows, he strategically misremembers the precise wording. Shortly after the re-telling of Outland's 'Story', he recalls 'some lines of a translation from the Norse' he used to read in 'one of his mother's few books'. He remembers the physicality of the book, 'a little two-volume Ticknor and Fields edition of Longfellow, in blue and gold, that used to lie on the parlour table', but his memory of the lines themselves contains a telling alteration: For thee a house was built Ere thou wast born; For thee a mould was made Ere thou of woman camest. St Peter is weary, feeling increasingly estranged from the new house, and it is appropriate that the 'house' in these lines is that of the poem's title, 'The Grave', prompting a sense of death which includes a further kind of estrangement, 'a release from every obligation, from every form of effort' (PH, pp. 271-72). His psychological lassitude may explain the minimal changes in word order from the original, but the change to 'woman' from 'mother' in the final line marks a crucial shift from filial loyalty to biology.20 The 'Truth' that St Peter discovers at this point is thus a recognition of that pervasive estrangement which has characterized his entire life and is brought to the fore by his transposition of Longfellow's words, a transposi- tion which suggests the novel's most radical understanding of origin: that of 19 St Peter's encounters with Crane and Crane's wife demonstrate clearly an important aspect of the novel's critique of the originatory idealism it interrogates throughout. St Peter can afford to be generous and to be disdainful of the material world (however grasping that world certainly is), but others, like Crane, cannot afford such luxuries. The novel is not about the corruption of ideals by materialism, but about the corrupting nature of idealism itself. Its prison is such that it reduces alarmingly St Peter's capacity to respond to the generosity of others - of Marsellus, for example, the prime figure of contemporaneity who is also unfailingly and unstintingly giving and considerate. 20 The change was first noticed in E. K. Brown, Willa Cather: A Critical Biography (New York: Knopf, 1953), p. 244.</page><page sequence="6">IAN F. A. BELL 17 origin before birth. Here, birth is conceived as entry into forms of relation- ship which extend beyond the biological into societal structures - those of the family, for example, where St Peter feels continually ill at ease. The appeal of the cliff dwellers belongs to this order of things in that their extinction seals off the locus of orgin from all forms of human process. That is why Outland, the 'perennial wanderer or outcast' who 'reads the myth of the castaway in its various forms - Book ii of the Aeneid, Gulliver's Travels, Robinson Crusoe',21 needs the Indians as 'ancestors' for boys like himself and Roddy Blake 'that have no other ancestors to inherit from' (PH, p. 242). His domestication of this ancestry as 'my poor grandmothers a thousand years ago' (PH, p. 243) serves, by its choice of gender, to point the strain of his efforts because everything else in the novel suggests that his prime need is for a remote genealogy untouched by the biological intimacy of parenthood. For St Peter, Outland thus becomes, in Hermione Lee's wise observation, 'preserved, in memory, as innocent and asexual',22 much as the cliff city itself is preserved. In this sense Outland corresponds to the first term of St Peter's crucial separation between the 'primitive' self of childhood and the 'secondary social man' (PH, pp. 264-65): 'The primitive self is presexual, solitary, and in wordless communication with nature.'23 Nowhere is the estrangement from relationship so clearly focused as in this separation of 'the original, unmodified Godfrey St. Peter' (PH, p. 263) and 'this secondary social man, the lover' (PH, p. 265), between 'the realest of his lives' (PH, p. 264) understood as the first, the primary, the original, and its distortions through social and sexual secondariness. St Peter's notion that this is the 'root' of the matter - 'Desire under all desires, Truth under all truths' (PH, p. 265) - precedes by only a few pages the 'Truth' of'a release from every obligation' (PH, p. 272) he becomes alerted to by the lines from Longfellow. Origin as pre-sexual joins the radicalism of origin before birth to prompt the vision of the 'solitary' (PH, p. 265) St Peter needs so urgently. Here is one of the reasons why the novel leaves St Peter with Augusta, the 'spinster' (PH, p. 16) who, for Susie Thomas, 'is not defined by her sex', whose life is 'not dependent on love, marriage or children',24 and so is largely released from the intimate responsibilities of relationships, from the world of familial mutuality. It is striking that St Peter's imagination is structured so powerfully not only by the historical past, the area of his research, but by memory, and that 21 John N. Swift, 'Memory, Myth, and The Professor's House', Western American Literature, 20 (1986), p. 304. 22 Lee, p. 226. By contrast, St Peter's family represent a 'corrupt, sexualised world' of envy and covetousness (p. 227). Lee's contrast has a clear pertinence, but has also a tendency to over-privilege its first term: Outland, is, under the general aegis of the cliff city and as a projection of St Peter's own needs, so 'preserved', but this preservation is more problematic than she seems to allow. 23 Lee p. 240. The complex of the pre-sexual and the pre-linguistic is most rigorously explored at the end of the decade in William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying (1930), again a novel which takes as its principal theme a journeying back to a point of origin (for a fascinating discussion of the novel's concerns, see Richard Godden, 'William Faulkner, Addie Bundren, and Language', Studies in English, 15 (1980), pp. 101-23). 24 Susie Thomas, Willa Cather (London: Macmillan, 1990), p. 123-</page><page sequence="7">18 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' his memories invariably seem to be bound up with these forms of estrange- ment whereby his conception of origin rests upon notions of the 'solitary'. We are to understand the 'solitary' as indicating not merely St Peter's psychological alienation from the family and from modernity in general, but a view of memory as a manufactured activity that is not reducible to biology.25 Part of the tragedy for St Peter is that memory and origin lack communality, remain 'solitary' indeed: the absence of Tom, of a collective discourse for a collaborative memory, impels the urge for disengagement, ratifies the need for origin as non-relational. The 'Truth' of release from responsibility that St Peter perceives in 'The Grave' after his renewed experience of Outland's 'Story' depends absolutely upon this isolating wrenching of memory and origin from reproduction and community. To seek for origin, the task shared by both men, depends upon the constructivity of memory to retain some primal authenticity, and one of the great lessons the novel recognizes is that such authenticity applies not to the past itself but to the present motives for construction. Nick Carraway, wanting to be 'a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler',26 Will shortly inventJay Gatsby out of a recent past in order to sanctify the glamour of a contemporary bourgeois need for Columbus's originatory exercise. So too does Godfrey St Peter invent Tom Outland by manufacturing a memory of an unchanging, incorruptible, and harmonious past as a means of resisting contemporary change in the university and in the nation at large. St Peter's need is to construct an ideological counter to the present alienations of a matriarchal structure and modern messiness or, rather, to offer a critique of those alienations through the purity of imagined origins. What interest Cather are the mechanics of that critique and its deployments of gender and relationship. St Peter's first substantial act of memory is prompted by the Mignon he hears in Chicago, reminding him of his 'student days in Paris' (PH, p. 92): He hears the opera as 'an expression of youth', but, oddly, the emotions evoked by 'Connais-tu - le pays' are not only 'sweet' but 'impersonal' (PH, p. 93), as if, even at a moment of intimacy, he cannot give himself over to memory's full experience. The youthfulness of the opera becomes reflected in Lillian's face, and as his sense of intimacy deepens, he orchestrates a return to that vanished time which carefully elides the world of responsible mutuality: 'It's been a mistake, our having a family and writing histories and getting middle-aged. We should have been picturesquely shipwrecked together when we were young' (PH, p. 94). We are made aware that this is a knowing gesture, that St Peter is cultivating a stance at one of the rare moments when he and Lillian would seem to be close - his Jamesian 'picturesquely' succinctly displays his artifice. St Peter continues to tend his 25 See David Thelen, 'Memory and American History', The Journal of American History, 75 (1989), pp. 1120-22. 26 F.

BELL 19 'idea of a picturesque shipwreck' that night in bed, and chooses as its 'finale' a scenario which excludes his wife: 'Indeed, nobody was in it but himself, and a weather-dried little sea captain from the Hautes-Pyrenees, half a dozen spry sea-men, and a line of gleaming snow peaks, agonizingly high and sharp, along the southern coast of Spain' (PH, p. 95). The height of those peaks underwrites St Peter's sense of removal, anticipating perhaps the height of the mesa itself where Outland, on his return after Blake's depar- ture, experiences the full vitality of solitary origination: 'That was the first night I was ever really on the mesa at all - the first night that all of me was there. This was the first time I ever saw it as a whole.' And his sensation at this point produces that complex of unity, harmony, clarity, and cleanliness which constitutes the ideal of origin. Those great divisions of post-industrial life, the intellectual and the manual, are brought together: while it was 'the first time I'd ever studied methodically, or intelligently', he was also busy in 'clearing away the mess the German had made in packing' and 'tidying up' the ruins. In the most instructive phrase of the novel, Outland is now able to 'co-ordinate and simplify' - a process whereby he can take 'possession' of the mesa as a result of his new alertness to 'filial piety' (PH, pp. 25-51 ). Outland becomes the son free of biological responsibility, the filial inheritor of origin before birth, on the height of the mesa. For St Peter also, cleanliness and clear shape mould the beginnings of his work on the early Spanish explorers. Aboard L'Espoir, where the crew are 'spare' and 'hard', it is the distant peaks of the Sierra Nevadas, 'high beyond the flight of fancy, gleaming like crystal and topaz', which provide the necessary shape: 'St. Peter lay looking up at them from a little boat riding low in the purple water, and the design of his book unfolded in the air above him, just as definitely as the mountain ranges themselves.' The design is 'sound' and 'inevitable', its definiteness shoring it against the mess of being 'meddled' with (PH, p. io6), not unlike the edifice presiding over the houses in the cliff city, 'a rude tower rising in their midst, rising strong, with calmness and courage - behind it a dark grotto, in its depths a crystal spring' (PH, p. 253). The maleness of the tower remains, while 'Mother Eve' is lost during the earlier period of Outland's birth, comparable to the male instigators (the peaks and the seamen) of the birth of St Peter's 'design' which exclude Lillian. Both are characterized by solitariness.27 Tom is an orphan and out of the land, and St Peter re-invents his own name to discard his ancestry: At the font he had been christened Napoleon Godfrey St. Peter. There had always been a Napoleon in the family, since a remote grandfather got his discharge from the Grand Armee. Godfrey had abbreviated his name in Kansas, and even his daugh- ters didn't know what it had been originally. 27 BothJohnJ. Murphy ('Willa Cather: The Widening Gyre' in Five Essays on Willa Cather: The Merrimack Symposium, ed. John J. Murphy (North Andover, MA: Merrimack College, 1974), pp. 69-70) and Susie Thomas (p. 139) provide useful summaries of aspects of the male-centred 'solitary,' but Murphy ignores St Peter's construction of Outland, and Thomas seems insufficiently alert to the tensions involved in the notion of the male family.</page><page sequence="9">20 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' With some irony, the text offers this as 'the Professor's darkest secret' (PH, p. I63), but it is a secret which not only emphasizes the privacy accompanying the 'solitary', it also wrenches both past and immediate family out of parentage. Rather like Carraway's re-invention whereby Gatsby is figured as having sprung 'from his Plantonic conception of himself' (p. 105), St Peter 'refusing the patrilineal name consciously rejects filiation and romantically attempts self-genesis'.28 Unlike Carraway, how- ever, for whom the myth of origin is understood in predominately female terms (an 'incarnation' where 'he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder' on 'a fresh, green breast of the new world' (pp. i18, 187)), St Peter's myth, programmed by Outland's 'Story', tends towards the masculine, as RobertJ. Nelson has observed.29 St Peter is able to associate 'Outland's country' ('those long, rugged, untamed vistas dear to the American heart') with his patrilineal ancestry (PH, p. 270) at the end only because he has already removed that ancestry from his own history. St Peter's memory of that other beginning, Outland's arrival in his garden, invests it with mystique. He appears from nowhere, and even before he has learned much about him, St Peter senses that his name 'seemed to suit the boy exactly' (PH, p. I 14). Even his clothing, 'a heavy winter suit' is out of place for the time of year (PH, p. I 12), and his mystique is enhanced by domestic versions of his release from rule: his parents were 'mover people' who died during his infancy (PH, p. I 15), his first job was as a 'call boy' dealing with the irregularities of schedules and behaviour (PH, p. I 16), he is panicked by the interior female domesticity of Lillian's invitation to lunch, is 'not much used to stairs, living mostly in 'dobe houses' (PH, p. I 17), and eats with his knife (PH, p. i18). The mystique is cultivated here through the iconography.of the roughneck, and calculated further in Outland's romance of Rodney Blake. Blake, too, resists rule. We see him first at a poker game, and he is contrasted with the other railway men by refusing the custom of 'cleaning up' after work: he continues to carry the marks of his toil, much to the annoyance of his 'clean and freshly shaven' companions (PH, p. I8o). His aloofness further separates him out (PH, pp. 18i, 184), yet at the same time Outland is eager to see him as a type of the worker - the phrase 'among working-men' is used three times within a short span to place his typological characteristics of disregard and selflessness (PH, pp. 181, 182, I85). Blake succeeds in the poker game by taking the jack-pot (PH, p. I8o) and is supremely indifferent to his large winnings (PH, pp. 182, 184); it is Outland who assumes the bourgeois role of persuading him to put the money in the bank (PH, p. I85). Outland is attracted by Blake's distance 28 Swift, p. 308. 29 Robert J. Nelson, Willa Cather and France: In Search of the Lost Language (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988), p. 97. We might add that St Peter's other 'house' - the house of patrilineal descent - is also to be denied him by the gender of his offspring.</page><page sequence="10">IAN F. A. BELL 21 (PH, pp. 181-82), but responds equally strongly to a special tenderness whereby 'he was the sort of fellow who can do anything for somebody else, and nothing for himself' and was not 'trained by success to a sort of systematic selfishness' (PH, p. 185). Blake's tenderness nurses Outland through pneumonia, assuming a paternal role (PH, pp. 185-86), and Out- land acknowledges the paradox of both a natural rightness and a gendered strangeness in his ministrations: 'He ought to have had boys of his own to look after. Nature's full of such substitutions, but they always seem to me sad, even in botany' (PH, p. 186). It is an odd comment. Outland appre- ciates that female tenderness of the male, the service Wordsworth's Michael had afforded his son,30 but he recognizes that the 'substitutions' of such gentleness are 'sad'; lacking a primal parentage, secondariness, even within 'acts of tenderness', is difficult for him in its recalling unspecifiable images of imagined loss. The sadness of 'substitutions' suggests also the situation of St Peter's own family where the estrangement from his biological children orchestrates the further substitution of Outland's 'Story' itself. Blake's tenderness extends to Outland's education, making sure that he keeps to his promise to Father Duchene to translate a hundred lines of Caesar a day, and here again Outland expresses Blake's efforts in typological terms: He said if I once knew Latin, I wouldn't have to work with my back all my life like a burro. He had great respect for education, but he believed it was some kind of hocus-pocus that enabled a man to live without work. (PH, p. 188) Outland's idealizing of the artisanal Blake persists through to his final sight of him, 'the stubborn, crouching set of his shoulders that I used to notice when he first came to Pardee and was drinking all the time' (PH, p. 247): he remains caught by a type of origin and authenticity even at this moment when he experiences the loss of comradeship. And Blake's final lesson is again one of resistance - here, against the illusory comfort and inauthentic feeling of 'common expressions' which are 'painted on signboards all over the world' as a last reminder of the secondariness which always prompts a need for the 'real'. The idealizing of Blake (paralleled by St Peter's idealizing of Outland) once more reveals its distance - for Outland, the mesa is always felt as 'a world above the world' (PH, p. 240) - its fissures through 'common' expressions which are versions of a public world that, for all its secondariness, remains the world we inevitably share. The novel's shape collaborates in this crisis of the secondary: St Peter needs to reconstruct Outland as Outland, to a lesser extent, needs to reconstruct Blake. The novel is alert to the design of reconstruction, just as it is alert to the design of memory. Outland's dirty and tender Blake who offers 'female service' is recognizably Whitmanian, the 'optimistic vagabond' in Cather's 30 William Wordsworth, 'Michael', Poetical Works, ed. by Thomas Hutchinson, rev. by Ernest de Selincourt (London: Oxford University Press, 1966), p. io6.</page><page sequence="11">22 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' fine phrase for the poet in her essay of 1896. Cather was scathing about the failures of discipline and discrimination in Whitman's 'reckless rhapsodies over creation in general', but she responded powerfully to his emotional generosity and his 'primitive elemental force' which 'looks at all nature in the delighted, admiring way in which the old Greeks and the primitive poets did'.31 Outland's Blake bears strong echoes of this primitiveness not only to recuperate a set of vanishing values but to demonstrate the designed structure of both Outland's and St Peter's reverting gaze. And The Professor's House in its querying of origin recognizes both the attractiveness and the dangers of the Whitmanian 'primitive' as it simultaneously celebrates and worries about the essentially non-relational features of the enterprise shared by Outland and St Peter. Blake's 'common expressions' are perhaps not too far removed from the 'generalization' and 'universalization' Whitman was accused of by Lawrence in 1923.32 For Outland and St Peter, the structure of origin is one which is, at best, hesitant towards the female, and it is striking that the Whitmanian 'pudding of one Identity' for Lawrence is, in the early poetry, a matter of female process, of merging. With Calamus, however, the emphasis changes to 'manly love': 'The strange calamus has its pink-tinged root by the pond, and it sends up its leaves of comradeship, comrades from one root, without the interven- tion of woman, the female.' It is here that Lawrence finds the 'great' Whitman, the 'one pioneer', because it is this male 'comradeship' which assumes the 'responsibility' of facing death, the condition so ambiguously confronted by St Peter at the end of the novel. Death for the Lawrentian Whitman is necessary but 'is not the goal.' The goal is 'the open road' which has 'no human direction even', only 'the soul remaining true to herself in her going'. And the 'open road' is adventure, is exploration, is Outland's journey to the mesa, is the 'democratic' lesson of 'American' art, 'a morality of the soul living her life, not saving herself'. This is a morality of 'living', not 'saving', and it is impelled not by 'love' but by 'sympathy'. Crucially for Lawrence, 'Sympathy means feeling with, not feeling for' where the latter becomes another version of 'merging', of mere 'salvation', a 'sinking of Walt Whitman's soul in the souls of these others'. A sympathy 'with' during the adventure of the 'open road', on the other hand, is 'the soul judging for herself, and preserving her own integrity', and this is the 'American heroic message' in which Whitman exhibits 'the true rhythm of the American continent speaking out in him', whereby he can be seen as 'the first white aboriginal'.33 The 'open road' undertaken by Outland experientially and by St Peter imaginatively seeks the 'integrity' of the soul through its negotia- tions of origin, but the passion of its sympathy invariably becomes a feeling 31 Willa Cather, 'Whitman: "keen senses do not make a poet"', in The World and the Parish: Willa Cather's Articles and Reviews, 1893-1902, ed. by William M.

Both are attracted by the possibilities of 'the first white aboriginal', but both fail its necessary discriminations of sympathy in favour of an image of origin whose non- relational nature is featured by its resistance to the female. By feeling for rather than with, they neglect necessary community. The Professor's House employs Whitman and Lawrence's recuperation not only to display the design of the 'Story' calculated by Outland and repossessed by St Peter, but to analyse the structures of their urge for origin itself.34 Finding a 'good home' for the relics dating from 'before Columbus landed' is important to Outland, saddened by the response of the museums who 'don't care about our things. They want something that came from Crete or Egypt' (PH, p. i 19), but at the same time the glamour associated with mediterranean antiquity is true also of Outland's own perception; the blue turquoises he gives to the girls, for example, are prized as 'just the way they came out of the mine,' prior to modern interference 'before the jewellers have tampered with them and made them look green' (PH, p. 120). Objects from the past become subject to fetishization - even objects of more recent provenance such as the blanket from 'Old Mexico' given by Blake to Outland during his pneumonia. The discovery that St Peter still possesses the blanket delights Kathleen who not only associates its smell with the early labours of Blake and Outland but allows it to prompt recollections of her childhood 'romantic dream', the adventurousness of finding Blake again (PH, pp. 130-31). Kathleen's romance of the blanket is immediately pre- ceded by the real world of material loss, the fate of Augusta's savings in the Kinkoo Copper Company and the family's plans to compensate her (PH, pp. 128-30), and it is against this world that her romance is positioned, against an Outland who has 'all turned out chemicals and dollars and cents' (PH, p. 132). This new version of Outland is that of Louie Marsellus for whom, later, the blanket adds 'a Spanish touch' to the Professor's study and would make a 'very proper dressing-gown' (PH, pp. 165-66). St Peter can only counter this with a view of the blanket as 'a precious possession' (PH, p. 166), but his earlier conversation with Kathleen suggests that it catches a much deeper mystery: 'When she was gone he still stood there, 34 There are moments in the novel where St Peter displays very clearly the self-consciousness of the 'Story' he constructs. As he begins to think about editing Outland's diary (the personal, authentic text we are never shown), he understands of Outland that 'he idealized the people he loved and paid his devoir to the ideal rather than the individual,' and points to the core of Outland's morality: 'One of his sentimental superstitions was that he must never on any account owe any material advantage to his friends, that he must keep affection and advancement far apart, as if they were chemicals that would disintegrate each other.' The sinuous alliteration of the opening phrase with its telling adjectival choice suggests St Peter's awareness of calculation, an awareness which is further emphasized by the way he expresses this 'superstition' as the 'logical result' of Outland's background: 'There is, he knew, this dream of self-sacrificing friendship and disinterested love down among the day-labourers, the men who run the railroad trains and boats and reapers and thrashers and mine-drills of the world' (PH, p. 172). This is an undeniably literary perception, a concision of the lengthy catalogues celebrating labouring comradeship that are so familiar in Whitman. 3</page><page sequence="13">24 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' motionless, as if he were listening intently, or trying to fasten upon some fugitive idea' (PH, p. 132). This 'fugitive idea' is never specified, but I would suggest that it has to do with his reconstruction of the 'original, unmodified Godfrey St. Peter', the 'realest of his lives' in the 'primitive' and 'solitary' Kansas boy (PH, pp. 263-65), through the 'Story' of Tom Outland. Again, the parallel with Fitzgerald's Nick Carraway is clear: the seeking of the 'wonder' of origin through 'an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago' (p. I 18). St Peter writes Outland's 'Story' as Carraway writes Gatsby's; both attempt the romance of the elusive, unwritable other as a means of approaching the beginning of things. While those means of approach are caught in difficulty and contradiction, the achieved image of origin, the mesa itself, seems clear in outline and idea. The remains that Outland finds at the foot of the mesa suggest both permanence and that other form of sympathy which Hawthorne called 'a sort of home-feeling with the past';35 'To people off alone, as we were, there is something stirring about finding evidence of human labour and care in the soil of an empty country. It comes to you as a sort of message, makes you feel differently about the ground you walk over every day' (PH, p. i94). This prolegomenon prepares for the stone city itself where naturalness is trans- posed into artifice: 'It was as still as sculpture - and something like that. It all hung together, seemed to have a kind of composition.' Design is para- mount here on behalf of an aesthetic perception which focuses an intensely masculine principle of order. Entry through the vaginal canyons emerges to confront the 'red' discipline of the tumescent tower standing in the centre of the city and orchestrating everything around it: It was beautifully proportioned, that tower, swelling out to a larger girth a little above the base, then growing slender again. There was something symmetrical and powerful about the swell of the masonry. The tower was the fine thing that held all the jumble of houses together and made them mean something. It is male order which aestheticizes the earlier naturalistic permanence, a 'sculpture' which produces 'immortal repose' and 'the calmness of eternity', transcending 'jumble' (PH, p. 201). Musculature and art work together for Outland: 'I felt that only a strong and aspiring people would have built it, and a people with a feeling for design' (PH, pp. 203-04). We know that Cather's own impression of the stone city parallels Out- land's closely, and her emphasis also stresses its design.36 Like Outland, she is committed to principles of order but, crucially, unlike Outland, her essay 3s Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter, ed. by Thomas E.

A. BELL 25 eschews gendered imagery to express those principles. The terms of her aesthetic are, however, strongly dependent upon the discourse of high modernism, finding that 'no later civilisation blurred the outlines there', that its architecture is 'absolutely harmonious with its site and setting' (my emphases). The city is a 'successful evasion of ugliness' and by its 'color, simplicity, space, and absence of clutter' it contrasts with the 'hundreds of ugly little American towns' she passed through on her journey from New York to the Montezuma valley, standing as 'a reproach to the messiness in which we live' ('MV', p. 84). Here is exactly the modernist preference (I'm thinking of Pound and Lewis in particular) for clean lines and an integrated culture against the 'blurred', 'clutter', and 'messiness'. The 'harmonious' unity of the stone city is placed against the atomized and fragmented nature of contemporary architecture. We remember how the novel opens with a domestic version of the issue where the clarity of St Peter's physical beauty is set against the awkwardness and discomfort of the old house, and how all the houses in the novel provide images of estrangement in one form or another: the furnishing and style of the Marsellus house, achieved through a variety of foreign borrowings, the ugliness of the house belonging to the Head of the Physics Department, and the abiding alienation St Peter feels from the new house. The Poundian predilection for clean lines is manifest also in the economy of style in Outland's own writing which exhibits the scientific clarity, precision, and concision that Pound always argued as the basis for good writing. We are told of Outland's diary: There was a minute description of each tool they found, of every piece of cloth and pottery, frequently accompanied by a very suggestive pencil sketch of the object and a surmise as to its use and the kind of life in which it had played a part. To St. Peter this plain account was almost beautiful, because of the stupidities it avoided and the the things it did not say. If words had cost money, Tom couldn't have used them more sparingly. The adjectives were purely descriptive, relating to form and colour, and were used to present the objects under consideration, not the young explorer's emotions. (PH, p. 262) This 'austerity' is Pound's objectivity in action, the objectivity which guards against 'messiness' and enables order. But St Peter senses some- thing else here: the 'ardour' and 'excitement' of a 'kindling imagination' which he compares to 'the vibration in a voice when the speaker strives to conceal his emotion by using only conventional phrases' (PH, pp. 262-63). St Peter understands the process implied in a 'kindling' imagination but then detracts from the objectivity he has previously been celebrating by a simile which relies upon the immateriality of a 'vibration in a voice'. This immateriality is then seen as a device for control in the form of concealment rather than concision, a concealment which expresses itself in 'conven- tional' phrases which are stridently at odds with the clear sight and particularity of Outland's style. It is a tactic of material and ideational</page><page sequence="15">26 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' dissolution, problematized by what we have already seen of Blake's final lesson to Outland, his stricture against 'common expressions'. But while 'conventional phrases' are anathema to the aesthetic otherwise evinced here, there is a psychological rightness to St Peter's thought at this point in that his habitual aloofness needs to renegotiate the conventionalities of language in order to create a more flexible discourse capable of moving beyond estab- lished positions. St Peter needs to open himself up to a 'kindling' imagination. He confesses to having mocked other 'conventional phrases' - people who talked about 'day-dreams' and who claimed 'naively' to have 'an imagination' - but now, from the experience of Outland's diary, he recognizes the 'late' arrival of a 'new sense' which he describes as a 'twilight stage' where he can cultivate 'a novel mental dissipation'. It is a 'dissipation' which enables him to enjoy a 'new friendship', not with Outland but with that other boy he had left behind in Kansas, 'the original, unmodified Godfrey St. Peter' (PH, p. 263). St Peter's new flexibility sets this 'realest of his lives' against the 'design' of his subsequent self, 'this secondary social man, the lover' (PH, pp. 264-65) where 'design' is no more than a shape 'determined by chance' (PH, p. 257) and where the breach between the two selves is marked by the entry of the female, Lillian. Unlike his 'secondary' life, 'accidental and ordered from the outside' (PH, p. 264), the 'realest' life obeys a different design, one that was authenticated by the naturalism he resisted for so long: it is a 'primitive' life, born of the non-relational 'solitary' apprehension of 'earth and woods and water', a primitivism which responds to nature with the simple assertions of 'That is right', 'That is it', and 'That is true' (PH, pp. 265-66). Such assertions and the feelings they accommodate mark 'the root of the matter; Desire under all desires, Truth under all truths' (PH, p. 265), a primitivism he will shortly apply to the apprehension of death which he anticipates essentially as a release from 'obligation' (PH, p. 272), and which again incorporates a resistance to relation. Within the novel's equation, then, origin approaches death in that both are conceived as 'solitary', as removed from a responsibility to otherness. St Peter's 'Story' of Outland has already recognized how his musclar intellect, 'his fine long hand with the backspringing thumb, which had never handled things that were not the symbols of ideas', had 'made something new in the world' and, by his early death, had 'escaped' its 'duties' (PH, pp. 26o-61). It is the style of Outland's diary which prompts the most sustained notion of personal origin in the novel, a style which, in tune with its allegiance to modernist discourse, tends to valorize the order of ritual. Cather's essay on the mesa follows its diatribe against 'clutter' and 'messiness' with a testi- mony to ritual as the 'ceremonial' expression of 'common actions' ('MV', p. 85). Outland, in the abstract, would appreciate her celebration of communal activity, but the solitariness he shares with St Peter inhibits him from experiential sympathy. Cather sees how the ritualistic life itself of the</page><page sequence="16">IAN F. A. BELL 27 inhabitants led to their demise,37 but still maintains it as a valuable counter to contemporaneity: 'they were absolutely unenterprising in the modern American sense' ('MV', p. 85) and engaged with 'a reality that goes deeper than the bustling business of the world' ('MV', p. 86). The ritualistic life is valuable here because of its naturalistic integration: a matter not of overcom- ing their environment, but of interpretation, supplementation, and 'acceler- ating a natural process' ('MV', p. 85). Cather's image of order founded on the naturalistic integration of ritual is reiterated in Father Duchene's narrative, but with the crucial difference that for Duchene, it is attainable only as a result of the city dwellers' isolation.38 Outland himself will appreciate this form of order later when he realizes that 'the mesa was no longer an adventure but a religious emotion' (PH, p. 251). However, his realization comes only when he is alone - St Peter's world of the 'solitary'. The movement from 'adventure' to 'religious emotion' is precisely the movement from Outland's sexual aesthetics, endowing the ordering prin- ciple of clean lines conceived as phallic energy and emphasizing construc- tivity,39 to the form of naturalism acknowledged by Cather's essay and by the 'truth' of the 'primitive' Kansas boy discovered by St Peter after his recuperation of Outland's 'Story'. Outland's realization, however, is not allowed to be conclusive. It occurs at the end of his 'Story' but is caught by conflicting impulses; he is still 'clearing away the mess' and 'tidying up the ruins,' but at the same time he claims not to feel the 'need' for the 'record' of his diary, his other modernist expression. And his final image of the stone city is prompted by the Aeneid, the chronicle of masculine adventure, and retains the male potency of the tower ordering female fluidity: '37 MV', p. 85; cf. PH, pp. 219-2I. Strategically, the most sustained reading of the stone city and its inhabitants in the novel is given to Father Duchene rather than in the first-person narrative of Outland himself. In part, it is to emphasize Outland's distance from conventional education, but, more importantly, it enables us to see, by comparison with the account given in Cather's essay, a particular strand of repression in St Peter's recuperation of Outland's 'Story'. While the essay maintains the conquerors as 'vulgar and pushing' (and, consequently, 'more energetic'), Duchene, with greater ferocity, has them as 'brutal invaders'. Cather's adjectives apply easily to St Peter's sense of Marsellus (particularly in conjunction with her sense of the city dwellers as 'unenterprising' by comparison with the invaders) but Duchene's 'brutal' clearly will not. Duchene's account is inserted precisely as a dramati- zation of St Peter's real distaste for the contemporaneity he sees in Marsellus, a distaste which he otherwise allows to remain unexpressed. 38 'Your people were cut off here without the influence of example or emulation, with no incentive but some natural yearning for order and security. They built themselves into this mesa and humanized it' (PH, p. 221). 39 The clearest expressions of such order are to be found in Wyndham Lewis and, particularly, Ezra Pound; most notoriously in Pound's 'Introduction' to his translation of Remy de Gourmont's Physique de L'Amour: Essai sur L'Instinct Sexuel of 1922. Pound sought to analyse the correlation between copulation and creative activity by arguing for the brain as a 'great clot of genital fluid' in order to explain 'the enormous content of the brain as a maker or presenter of images': 'There are traces of it in the symbolism of phallic religions, man really the phallus or spermatozoid charging, head-on, the female chaos; integration of the male in the male organ. Even oneself has felt it, driving any new ideas into the great passive vulva of London, a sensation analogous to the male feeling in copulation' (Remy de Gourmont. The Natural Philosophy of Love, trans. with an introduction by Ezra Pound (London: Neville Spearman, 1957), pp. vii, viii).</page><page sequence="17">28 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' blue and purple rocks and yellow-green pinons with flat tops, little clustered houses clinging together for protection, a rude tower rising in their midst, rising strong, with calmness and courage - behind it a dark grotto, in its depths a crystal spring. Certainly this is a more muted image than that urged by his first sighting, but the 'red' tumescence of that sighting remains too strong merely to be replaced by the naturalism of the 'religious emotion'. It is surely telling that Outland's realization of what he has lost in the adventure of the mesa is 'sanguine' indeed: 'Anyone who requites faith and friendship as I did, will have to pay for it. I'm not very sanguine about good fortune for myself. I'll be called to account when I least expect it' (PH, pp. 251-53). The competing discourses within the novel and within the novel's relation to Cather's essay register the therapy of the simultaneous pull and problem of the notion of origin which both attempt to probe.40 The therapeutic urge for origin tells us a good deal about St Peter's need for the adventure of Outland's 'Story', but the novel illustrates at the same time that the urge cannot be allowed to remain intact. The 'preserved' nature of the mesa is what first strikes Outland (PH, pp. 20 1-02) and Cather ('MV', p. 84). And while Outland fails to export its remains to another form of preservation, the Smithsonian, Cather herself is defensive about that very form. Her essay is at pains to set it off against the anthropomorphic naturalism she celebrates throughout: The Mesa Verde is not, as many people think, an inconveniently situated museum. It is the story of an early race, of the social and religious life of a people indigenous to that soil and to its rocky splendors. It is the human expression of that land of sharp contours, brutal contrasts, glorious color and blinding light. ('MV', pp. 85-86) Outland and Cather come together, however, on the agency of preservation itself, the agency of the 'blinding light' expressed through a shared simile: Cather has the city 'preserved in bright dry sunshine, like a fly in amber' ('MV', p. 84) and Outland, who is not given to figurative discourse, has it 'preserved in the dry air and almost perpetual sunlight like a fly in amber' (PH, p. 202). Therapy seems to require that origin be preserved and thus transcendental, nurturing the 'immortal repose' Outland finds on the mesa (PH, p. 201), but, as the domestic narratives of the novel have already demonstrated, it is at the expense of the relational: the mesa is 'hidden away' and 'inaccessible' (PH, p. 202). The problematical nature of preservation is seen in the simile of 'a fly in amber' by which it is imaged. The simile is a familiar figure, but its familiarity incorporates a volatile clash of material: the 1883 edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable defines it as 'An incongruous mixture of natural objects, which cause wonder, like flies in amber. Leaves and insects are often found imbedded in amber.' This yoking of the animate and inanimate is thus both natural and unnatural, and it elicits 'wonder', one of the most crucial terms in the American literary 40 See Swift, pp. 302-03.</page><page sequence="18">IAN F. A. BELL 29 imagination41 which so often accommodates a transcendental vision and which manifests itself strategically in that other major exposition of origin in the mid-I92os, Nick Carraway's therapeutic invention of Jay Gatsby.42 What is more, the OED reminds us of the association of 'amber' with the spermatic affiliations of 'ambergris', which we might wish to ally with the modernist sexual aesthetic through which Outland has just viewed the tower.43 If origin as preservation is essential to the therapy of beginnings, then what Swift calls 'a reassuring originary story of security and love' is exposed not only by the familial violence of the Mother Eve episode (PH, pp. 214, 223), but by the discordance of the simile which provides the main figure for preservation.44 The contradictory entanglement of ideas here is foregrounded by Outland's placing of his diary in the 'Eagle's Nest' (PH, p. 223), the site of his discovery of the mummified body: the first mother whose ravaged exclusion from the community is recapitulated in the acci- dent during Blake's removal of the remains (PH, p. 244). Those remains themselves are contradictory for Outland's gendered perceptions: they belong not only 'to this country, to the State, and to all the people' and 'to boys like you and me, that have no other ancestors to inherit from', but they are also 'the pots and pans that belonged to my poor grandmothers a thousand years ago' (PH, pp. 242-43), and he claims that 'I'd as soon have sold my own grandmother as Mother Eve - I'd have sold any living woman first' (PH, p. 244). In the midst of his distress at what he sees as Blake's betrayal, he maintains a stance that is characterized by the images we have already seen associated with the notion of origin- images of anti-materialism, preservation, and artisanal integrity: There was never any question of money with me, where this mesa and its people were concerned. They were something that had been preserved through the ages by a miracle, and handed on to you and me, two poor cow-punchers, rough and ignorant, but I thought we were men enough to keep a trust. Blake is sensitive to Outland's distress, but also to what he sees as Outland's idealized style in categorizing his diatribe as 'this Fourth of July talk'. Blake's deployment of another discourse of origin as counter to Outland's raises again an echo of the contemporary concern over citizenship, but more 41 It is most admirably documented in Tony Tanner, The Reign of Wonder: Naivety and Reality in American Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965). 42 The Great Gatsby, pp. I I, I 18, I88. 43 See n. 39 above. 44 Swift, p. 303. Swift is especially acute (on models derived from psychoanalysis and myth) in disputing the argument that the return to origin is to a site of harmony and reassurance (pp. 309-1o), and he makes convincing claims for the secondariness that the return involves (p. 31 1). Swift's reading is thus extremely helpful in explaining the therapeutic issues of the novel, but it remains rather confined by its procedures. Cather is engaged in nothing so blunt as a mere negation of origin understood in these terms: her interest is in its potency, in the forces which impel it, and in the competing discourses which construct it. She understands that the urge for origin is an urge for the singular, for the phallocentric modernism of clean lines capable of redesigning the 'messiness' of multiplicity. She recognizes the attractiveness of the urge in the attractiveness of Outland's 'Story', but recognizes also how it is problematized by its contradictory assumptions about gender, and how it operates violently against all relational and societal systems, all acknowledgements of mutuality.</page><page sequence="19">30 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' urgently he displays the dehumanizing consequences of Outland's idealism: 'I see now I was working for you like a hired man, and while you were away I sold your property' (PH, pp. 244-45). The schismatic world of wages and property is exactly that which Outland's 'Story' is designed to resist through its privileging of origin; butjust as his later abstractions in science 'turned out chemicals and dollars and cents' (PH, p. 132), so here we witness the intimate damage to friendship as a direct consequence of the emotional and moral irresponsibility of his other abstraction, his valorizing of non-parental ance- stry. Outland's attitude to the sale of the relics reveals very clearly the extent to which he relies on a specious opposition between public and private concerns. His claim that they belong 'to this country, to the State, and to all the people' (PH, p. 242) is a communal gesture which barely conceals an acquisitiveness whereby ancestry is a matter of inheritance. In his reply to Blake's 'Motives don't count, eh?' he sees 'motives' as applicable solely to the private sphere within an argument which dehumanizes his companion even further: They would in anything of our own, between you and me. [...] If it was my money you'd lost gambling, or my girl you'd made free with, we could fight it out, and maybe be friends again. But this is different. (PH, p. 246) Nowhere is the harmful insularity of the 'solitary' so effectively displayed as in this distortion of the relations between public and private which contributes to the devaluing of Blake. Outland's sense of the communal is a version of the image of harmony invested in the stone city, a permanent coherence which promises a transcendence of private ambition and an antidote to the acquisi- tiveness of the material world, and while he understands eventually that such an image is at the expense of friendship, he does not understand how this sacrifice is on behelf of an abstraction which privatizes the worth of that mutuality.45 Outland's distortion of the public sphere suggests that the novel's concern is not only with the contradictions of the harmoniously ordering principles of origin in a struggle against the 'messiness' of a mat- erialist world, but with the extent to which this view of origin is itselfa reflex of the materialism it despises, it is not seen as offering an alternative or an ameliatory antidote. We can certainly see the novel, along with David Stouck, as 'a critique ofAmerican society and its preoccupation with material wealth' (p. oo00)',46 but we cannot leave it at that. The Professor's House is engaged not 45 Jennifer Bailey has noted how the insularity of both Outland and St Peter is reflected in the isolation of the cliff city and how St Peter's garden serves as a mirror for the rigidity of memory and its resistance to change ('The Dangers of Femininity in Willa Cather's Fiction', Journal of American Studies, I6 (1982), p. 403). Hermione Lee makes a similar case for the isolation of St Peter's domestic interior (p. 236), and David Daiches also attends to domesticity in noticing how 'even his love of fine sherry is out of place in a prohibitionist era' (Willa Cather: A Critical Introduction (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, i95i), p. 104). 46 That such an image provides the centre of value for critics such as David Stouck (in Willa Cather's Imagination (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, i975), pp. 99-I i8) reveals its abiding attractiveness and necessity rather than any real virtue in the social world; Stouck simply ignores the extent to which Cather wants to acknowledge that attractiveness and to display its contradictions in human terms.James Woodress (in Willa Cather: Her Life &amp; Art (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1970), p. 21I) has a good phrase for Outland's 'Story' - 'a magical tale' - which, if I may wrench it out of context, is useful in its suggestion of both the glamour of the 'Story' and its removal from social process and interaction.</page><page sequence="20">IAN F.

The public world in the novel, outside St Peter and Outland, is experi- enced only as one of 'shams' and 'false substitutions'.47 It is proper and necessary, that St Peter is alert to the slippages of 'professor' into 'profession' and 'professionalization' and that he should champion the older system of 'scholarship', the arena of 'purely cultural studies' at a time of its super- vention by 'commercial studies' as the 'State Legislature and the board of regents seemed determined to make a trade school of the university' (PH, p. 140). His position replicates Brooks Adams's warning of 1903 about a bourgeois culture that is parsimonious towards the life of the mind.48 It replicates also the situation of Ursula Brangwen in Lawrence's The Rainbow of 1915. Her move from Cossethay to Willey Green is a move to the new social order of bourgeois suburbia, a site of 'stout inflated prosperity' and '"good and substantial" importance' where the college she attends serves the same bourgeois ends as a 'little, slovenly laboratory for the factory'. Like St Peter, Ursula sees the 'commercial shrine' of the college as not only 'debased' and 'vulgar' but as a world of secondariness, a 'sham workshop' with only a pretence to 'the religious virtue of knowledge'.49 Ursula chooses the adjective 'religious' carefully. It recalls the crisis which besets her throughout the novel of'a passionate confusion between the vision world and the weekday world', a confusion which recognizes that although 'the vision should translate itself into weekday terms', the vision 'can never be more than half interpreted in terms of the relative world' and that such translation 'was a betrayal, a transference of meaning, from the vision world, to the matter-of-fact world' (pp. 286-87, 284, 287). St Peter shares this fear of translation, as in his patrician refusal of Rosamond's offer of the Outland money: 'It would somehow damage my recollections of him, would make that episode in my life commonplace like everything else [.. .] my friendship with Outland is the one thing I will not have translated into the vulgar tongue.' It is also a refusal of the public world which he can envisage only in commercial terms ('Your bond with him was social, and it follows the laws of society, and they are based on property. Mine wasn't, and there was no material clause in it' (PH, pp. 62-63) ) and a refusal which is further encoded by a need to control the female as he thinks back protectively to his other daughter as a student: 'There was something too plucky, too "I can-go-it- alone," about her quick step and jaunty little head; he didn't like it, it gave him a sudden pang. He would always call to her and catch up with her, and make her take his arm and be docile' (PH, p. 64).

This is one of the reasons why St Peter experiences such awkwardness when he begins his editorial work on Outland's diary to create the story of 'a many-sided mind': his hand 'becomes self-conscious, feels itself stiff and clumsy' (PH, pp. 17 1-72). It is the awkwardness of having to 'write' Outland (in the diary 'there was almost nothing about Tom himself', an exemplary cipher of modernist impersonality) in language which employs the discourse of 'scholarship' and the design of origin against the materiality of the 'weekday' and the 'matter-of-fact': the transcendent and apocalyptic vision of the rainbow is not available to him. Adams's critique of education's commercialization concluded by seeing the 'specialized mind' of science as the enemy.50 In St Peter's world, the fate of Robert Crane, 'one of the staunchest' of those who 'made any serious stand for scholarship', exemplifies Adams's position: He had lost the Deanship of the College of Science because of his uncompromising opposition to the degrading influence of politicians in university affairs. The honour went, instead, to a much younger man, head of the department of chemistry, who was willing 'to give the taxpayers what they wanted' (PH, p. 140).51 And St Peter himself delivers a lecture emphasizing the paucity of scientific achievement as a 'phase of human development' by comparison with that of art conceived in both the visionary 'religious' terms urged by Ursula Brangwen and the modernist tenet of 'getting splendid effects by excision' (PH, pp. 67-69), the tenet of Outland's diary which is 'beautiful' because of 'the things it did not say' (PH, p. 262). Science, as a synecdoche for the contemporary valorization of professionalization, also works according to the tenet of 'excision', but for St Peter it produces only the narrowness of the 'specialized' mind, 'ingenious toys' (PH, p. 68), and not the generative intelligence of the Poundian 'luminous detail'. The public proclamation of his lecture romanticizes Adams's position and in so doing succeeds only in removing it from social discourse. By contrast, the integrated harmony of the mesa incorporates what Hermione Lee has aptly called 'pre-commercial' science (p. 246). It is proper that St Peter should oppose these contemporary narrownesses, but the form his opposition takes involves a severe distortion of the 'public': his psychological urge for the non-relational in his own experience is what prompts his romance of the harmony of art and the mesa and produces exactly the narrowing he detects in science. St Peter's narrowing is companion to his valorization of the solitary, his patrician distaste for the social and commercial world, his admiration for clean lines against 'messiness', and his predilection for a notion of origin that is singular and thus not only a barrier of protection against contemporary multiplicity, but a guarantor of the 'realest' of lives, of the 'original, 50 Brooks Adams, p. 217. 5s The role of Horace Langtry provides a further example of such degradation (PH, p. 55).</page><page sequence="22">IAN F. A. BELL 33 unmodified'. His position thus anticipates the critique we find in Theodor Adorno's 'Gold Assay' where the impetus for the 'genuine' is seen as an illusory and damaging reflex of a commodified culture. For Adorno, the self 'grows richer the more freely it develops and reflects' its social relations while 'it is limited, impoverished and reduced by the separation and hardening that it lays claim to as an origin'. The genuineness sought for by such 'separation' reveals its own illusoriness as 'authenticity itself becomes a lie the moment it becomes authentic, that is, in reflecting on itself, in postu- lating itself as genuine, in which it already oversteps the identity that it lays claim to in the same breath.' Consequently, the 'genuine' becomes a 'fetish', a 'separation and hardening' from the nexus of relations.52 Fritz Oehlschlaeger has persuasively seen St Peter's fate as one of ceasing to be 'available' to others, becoming 'self-preoccupied, self-encumbered, self- enclosed',53 immune to social and familial hospitality, private and narrow. The publication of his history of the Spanish explorers is itself a shift from the private to the public sphere, and Oehlschlaeger brilliantly suggests how the completion of the history transforms it from the sphere of'being' to the world of 'having' where 'St. Peter's work has become a piece of property, the new house which the prize has bought and in which he feels profoundly alien' (p. 8I). The subject of St Peter's history shows the movement to another point of American origin as adventure whilst simultaneously revealing it as a means of colonization: thus easily does process as discovery move towards 'separ- ation and hardening'. And it is adventure that is so important to St Peter's imagination, scholarship, and psychological well-being. Having completed his history, having it removed from the private to the public sphere, he is effectively frozen off from all sites of contact and relation, and so has to resort to another imaginative adventure, the editing of Outland's diary and the romance of his discovery of the mesa, in an effort to recuperate the process of adventure, the purity of the unfinished,the generative restlessness of action rather than the 'separation' of the achieved object. These interlinking models of history and of writing again take us back to Lawrence and the idea of 'Americanization', as opposed to the 'complacent record' of'civilisation', which provides 'a glimpse of what the vast America wants men to be' where a man 'can only begin to be American'.54 For Lawrence, the 'spirit of place' encourages a view of the world as unfinished, as being always in a state of preparation for something. This enabling and creative notion of the pro- visory permeates St Peter's imagination at the same time as he feels impelled to more static images of harmony and stability: in an important sense, the novel is rooted in the idea of preparation. Its principal site is St Peter's attic 52 Theodor Adorno, Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life, trans. by E. F. N.

At the other end were many little rolls of patterns, cut out of newspapers and tied with bits of ribbon, gingham, silk, georgette. [...] In the middle of the box, patterns and manuscripts interpenetrated. (PH, p. 22) Despite the textual insistence on gendered difference here, this inter- penetration marks the only moment of male/female mutuality in the novel.56 But for the moment I want to underline the provisory quality of the materials displayed: notebooks and patterns are but designs for the full monograph or the finished dress which will follow. Similarly, the other inhabitants of the attic, the 'forms' (PH, pp. 17-19), are also provisory: neither constructs the full figure, and both belong to a design for some later completion. At the same time, St Peter has completed his Spanish Adventurers in North America and is preparing for what follows, the editing of Outland's diary, while Lillian and Augusta are engaged in preparing the new house. Outland's theory belongs to this arena of preparation: an idea, 'a formula written out on paper' (PH, p. 138), which enables the later development of the engine, and it is at this level that St Peter most appreciates him: 'those first years, before Outland had done anything remarkable, were really the best of all' (PH, p. 125). Both St Peter and Outland express their commitment to this arena through their delight in the girls as children (PH, pp. 124-25), in the promise of youth; and the strength of St Peter's commitment is figured through an unusually violent reference: 'When a man had lovely children in his house, fragrant and happy, full of pretty fancies and generous impluses, why couldn't he keep them? Was there no way but Medea's, he wondered?' (PH, p. 126). His invocation of Medea wrenches his observation out of paternal sentimentality: as an image for the restoration of lost youth through death, Medea displays the urgency of St Peter's continual need for beginning again - the passage is not merely self-indulgent or nostalgic. 55 In Women in Love of 192 1, Lawrence places his argument in Birkin's addresses to Ursula: 'What I want is a strange conjunction with you [...] not meeting and mingling [...] but an equilibrium, a pure balance of two single beings: - as the stars balance each other' (Women in Love (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1968), p. 164). It is the 'merging, the clutching, the mingling of love' that has 'become madly abhorrent to him', the female 'lust for possession' (p. 224) that, thinking back to his views on Whitman, may be seen as a consequence of feeling 'for' rather than feeling 'with'. St Peter's sense of the post-sexual world as one of relational complication is not dissimilar. 56 A little later, we discover that St Peter evades another kind of interpenetration by resisting another kind of male ordering: 'Just in that corner, under Augusta's archaic "forms", he had always meant to put the filing-cabinets he had never spared the time or money to buy. They would have held all his notes and pamphlets, and the spasmodic rough drafts of passages far ahead' (PH, pp. 3 1-32). Here, he evades not only the interpenetrative yoking permitted by the more casual and intimate 'upholstered box,' but also the more stridently male ordering of'messiness'. To place these two moments together is to recognize the struggle of composition for St Peter, a struggle which will involve his renegotiations of male and female images of writing.</page><page sequence="24">IAN F. A. BELL 35 To begin again is to adventure, to engage the provisory, the unfinished, as tactics within the process of 'being' which will postpone the illusory and damaging fixity of 'having'. It is the adventure of multiplicity, of Adams's 'multitude of complex relations', against the commercializing solidity and narrowness of the 'specialized' professional mind. It is an adventure which incorporates specific aesthetic positions, both romantic and modern, draw- ing together Whitman's poetry and prose,57 Lawrence,58 Pound's apprecia- tion of Whistlerian lessons and his own predilection for the uncompleted.59 Romanticism and modernism interweave as St Peter's papers interweave with Augusta's patterns within the attic, the site of their provisory design, to shadow St Peter's psychological crisis as an aesthetic issue, a struggle of writing. St Peter needs continually to renegotiate the stories of origin, the stories of the female, and the stories of style on behalf of an attempted master-'Story'. He needs to explore the attractiveness and the dangers of the modernism to which he feels drawn by temperament in order to construct a more patient form of composition. This new form will depend upon a reconsideration of the female - or, rather, to re-insert a fresh consideration of female possibilities which will outweigh the masculinist thrusts of his and Outland's design of origin: the distance between the phallocentric Tower of Outland's 'Story' and the more neutrally harmonious Tower we find in Cather's essay on the mesa verde is a distance which graphs the terrain St Peter has to confront. Cather herself had a strong complaint against female writing in a newspaper article of 1895: I have not much faith in women in fiction. [...] Women are so horribly subjective and they have such scorn for the healthy commonplace. When a woman writes a story of adventure, a stout sea tale, a manly battle yarn, anything without wine, women and love, then I will begin to hope for something great from them, not before.60 Her insistently male image of fiction as stories of 'adventure' neglects the necessary interpenetration of male/female mutuality which physically struc- tures the attic of the Professor's house but which is only partially understood 57 Walt Whitman, Selected Poems and Prose, ed. by A.

Both he and Cather want the 'adventure' of modernist writing and its accompanying promise of the clean lines of a style which will re-design the 'horribly subjective', but both suffer from a tendency to see the issue in terms that are reductively schismatic. The reader may fall prey to a similar tendency,and seems encouraged to do so by the novel. St Peter's other site of work is his 'walled-in garden', created as a resistance to the incursions of familial beginnings and their subsequent responsibilities. The garden is the site of his 'bachelor' months of the summer, separated from both family and females in Euripidean man- ner,61 and of his conversations with Outland. Above all, it has a neatness that comes from artifice: 'There was not a blade of grass; it was a tidy half-acre of glistening gravel and glistening shrubs and bright flowers.' The garden foreshadows the organizing principle of the stone city in the later narrative, having 'in the middle two symmetrical, round-topped linden- trees', and its neatness extends to the attic which, while otherwise character- ized by decreptiude, reveals the 'consideration' St Peter and Augusta display towards each other in tidying up after their respective activities, just as Outland will tidy up the mesa on behalf of the city which displays 'little rubbish or disorder' (PH, p. 208). The novel encourages us to continue with the gender-base of these schisms by offering its moments of tenderness in Whitmanian/Wordsworthian terms of male affection, whether in Blake's nursing of Outland (PH, pp. 185-86) or in Henry Atkin's familial feminizing of space in the cabin (PH, pp. 197-98), with the implication that such tenderness is not available in female hands. Atkins, another 'castaway', creates a 'happy family' out of a companionship which is not only male but 'solitary' on the model of St Peter's romance of'L'Espoir' (PH, pp. 95, io6). It is the 'good housekeeper' Atkins who names the mummy discovered in the Eagle's Nest as 'Mother Eve' (PH, p. 214) shortly before his death from the snakebite which recalls the other aspect of Eden's originatory tale (PH, p. 217). Her body comes as a considerable shock within the rarified purity of the stone city: her condition is grotesquely rather than harmoniously part of nature's process and the ravage to her body is gruesomely at odds with the city's clean lines: 'There was a great wound in her side, the ribs stuck out through the dried flesh. Her mouth was open as if she were screaming, and her face, through all those years, had kept a look of terrible agony' (PH, p. 214).62 This is not only the murder of the female, or even of the first mother: Father Duchene speculates that her death was the punishment for adultery 61 Exhausted by the 'orgy of acquisition' he witnesses on the shopping trip with Rosamond, where he compares his daughter to the other Napoleon 'looting the Italian palaces' (PH, p. 154), St Peter muses on Euripides and 'how, when he was an old man, he went and lived in a cave by the sea. [...] It seems that houses had become insupportable to him. I wonder whether it was because he had observed women so closely all his life' (PH, p. I56). This gentle equation of family, house, and female points to the dispersal and multiplicity which St Peter's story of origin is calcuated to resist. 62 The ravage to Myrtle Wilson's body, and significantly to her breast and mouth, is comparable (The Great Gatsby, p. 144).</page><page sequence="26">IAN F. A. BELL 37 (PH, p. 223), the most intimate and immediate act of female betrayal. The violence of the narrative's projection here extends St Peter's antipathy to the female beyond notions of materialism and acquisitiveness, beyond even that fraught world of 'accident' and 'chance' which he associates with the effect of the female on his 'unmodified' Kansas self, that fall from the design and order of the 'original'; it portrays the female specifically as the source of danger. The viciousness of the Mother Eve episode dramatizes what had been quietly understated in 'The Family' section of the novel: Lillian, whilst irritated by the lapses in Outland's manners, could accommodate, and even 'seemed to like', such lapses from Marsellus, and we are told 'with her sons-in-law she had begun the game of being a woman all over again' (PH, p. 79). These schismatic dissociations of gender within the world of 'The Family' are, by a different form of violence, accommodated by the other inhabitants of the study sewing-room shared by St Peter and Augusta - the two 'forms' which manifest clear distortions of the female body (PH, pp. 17-19; cf. pp. 21-22, 98, IOI). If the novel encourages these schisms of gender, Margaret Doane's argument that for St Peter 'women are representative of a mundane world that destroys artistic capabilities. [...] petty, materialistic, and a distinct threat to the higher values of males' is misleading.63 This reading can only replicate the fantasy of male order and female chaos focused through the impulse for non-relational origin in St Peter's struggle of writing. Cather is careful to place the possibility for mutuality his struggle requires at the very beginning of the novel, in the interpenetrative structure of the box contain- ing St Peter's manuscripts and Augusta's patterns (PH, p. 22). Augusta 'had been most at the house' during that other moment of beginning for St Peter, the years when his children were small and he was commencing work on his Spanish Adventurers in North America, and the first description of his composi- tion borrows its metaphor from her work: the attic is the place where his 'records and ideas' were 'digested and sorted, and woven into their proper place in his history' (PH, p. 25). The metaphor from weaving recurs during a later moment of recollection, after his conversation with Augusta about the Magnificat, when, in a 'cheerful' mood prompted by Augusta and her use of the 'forms', he recalls those years as a 'holiday' time, again in terms of the youthfulness and freshness of his female family: His mind had played delightedly with all those incidents. Just as, when Queen Mathilde was doing the long tapestry now shown at Bayeux, - working her chronicle of the deeds of knights and heroes, - alongside the big pattern of dramatic 63 Margaret Doane, 'In Defense of Lillian St. Peter: Men's Perceptions of Women in The Profjssor's House', Western American Literature, i8 (1984), 229-302 (pp. 229-300). More pertinent is Allan Lloyd Smith's argument: 'As Mother Eve is incubus or succubus to Tom, so Tom is to the Professor. The outward mark or obsessive symptom of St Peter's preference for the masculine lies in this hysterical objectification of resentment for the feminine, enshrined in the fetish models from which he refuses to be parted' ('The Secret of the Blue Mesa: Willa Cather, The Professor's House and the Lost America' an unpublished lecture delivered to the EAAS Biennial Conference, Seville, 1992).</page><page sequence="27">38 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' action she and her women carried the little playful pattern of birds and beasts that are a story in themselves. St Peter is happy to appropriate the metaphor and Queen Mathilde's model for his own practice: 'So, to him, the most important chapters of his history were interwoven with personal memories' (PH, pp. Ioo-oi). In one sense, this forecasts Outland's quasi-Hawthornesque domestication of history (PH, p. 194), but more urgently it diminishes the metaphor's capacity for mutuality. The connectedness offered here cannot help but privilege the male 'big pattern of dramatic action' against the female 'little playful pattern of birds and beasts'. This is not the generative interpenetration promised by the 'upholstered box' in the attic: it is the sentimentality of 'writing his best' accompanied by 'incidents' which include 'pretty little girls in fresh dresses' and 'a better dinner than usual' (PH, p. Ior). Neverthless, the model of weaving and its association with Augusta remain essential to St Peter's thinking - his playfulness with the tapestry is evidence of the arena he struggles within: it is not to be dismissed merely as the valorizing of male order. St Peter manages a less reductive weaving in the conversation with Augusta about the Magnificat which 'brightened' his mood and encouraged his recollective musings on the 'holiday season' of his history. It is in fact a re-weaving, a literal transposition of originatory and ancient texts, as he substitutes the 'Lily of Zion' for the Litany's 'Tower of David' (PH, p. 99). Gathered here is the nexus of ideas concerning origin and gender which structures the novel's preoccupations. St Peter is 'intensely interested' to discover that the first writing of the nativity comes from a female hand: it is the only moment in the novel to register the conjunction of origin and gender so directly, and the conversation takes place on Christmas Day to recall Outland's discovery of the stone city on Christmas Eve. St Peter's error yields a rich field of play amongst his list of images, 'the Mystical Rose, Lily of Zion, Tower of Ivory'. Initially, the replacing of the 'Tower of David' by the 'Lily of Zion' marks a replacing of a male by a female image, but it is not a complete substitution: Zion is the oldest part of Jerusalem and is also called the City of David, thus enabling the 'Lily of Zion' to partake of both genders (at II Kings 19.21 and Isaiah 37.22, we have 'the virgin, the daughter of Zion'). Mary belonged to the House of David, and the second verse of a familiar nineteenth-century Catholic hymn, John Wyse's 'I'll Sing a Hymn to Mary' (based substantially on the Litany of Loreto), found no awkwardness in celebrating the Virgin through the patrilineal image: O noble Tower of David, of gold and ivory, the Ark of God's own promise, the gate of heav'n to me. The terms of St Peter's list interfere with each other most productively in The Song of Solomon where we find 'I am the rose of Sharon, And the lily of</page><page sequence="28">IAN F. A. BELL 39 the valleys' (2.1), 'Thy neck is like the Tower of David builded for an armoury' (4-4), and 'Thy neck is as a tower of ivory' (7.4). St Peter's 'Lily of Zion' is an invention: it does not exist in any earlier text, and St Peter's weaving of the image amongst the two established images of the Litany of Loreto, the 'Mystical Rose' and the 'Tower of Ivory,' demonstrates the inventiveness and careful construction of his substitution. It is the rose that is traditionally associated with the Virgin, as the Litany testifies, but, as Eithne Wilkins has argued in the most detailed and scholarly account of the subject, it carries a complex iconography of voluptuousness.64 St Peter's weaving of the Lily with the Rose suggests a joining of both the Litany and the Song of Solomon, both purity and eroticism. They share an equal partnership and although they are, in a sense, governed by the final image, the 'Tower of Ivory', it seems appropriate that this Tower recalls the harmonizing order of the Tower in the stone city discerned by Cather in her 1916 essay rather than the phallocentric Tower appropriated by Outland as an aggressively masculine system of design. The Rose also belongs to the preoccupation with origin in that, as Wilkins has shown, 'it is a flower older than the human race' (p. Io8), and it is surely not accidental that St Peter (whose name inevitably carries a large Biblical weight) chooses Rosamond as the name for his first daughter. The play of St Peter's weaving amongst these images and texts is a reflection of the novel's lexical playfulness at this point. St Peter's encounter with Augusta occurs as she is returning from Mass: Mass in Latin is 'missa' which slips easily into 'mesa', a Spanish word meaning 'table' which echoes the tabernacle proposed by the apostle Peter at the Mount of Transfiguration (Mark 9.5) and Moses's tablets of stone which are given literal expression in the readings provided to Outland by the stone city itself.65 It matters that St Peter's re-weaving takes place in the company of Augusta: the real action of the novel begins with her arrival (PH, p. 19), and throughout she is intimately bound up with St Peter's writing. As a 'spinster', she presents none of the sexual dangers and obligations he associates with the female; 'reliable and methodical' she shares the 64 Eithne Wilkins, The Rose-Garden Game: The Symbolic Background to the European Prayer Books (London: Victor Gollancz, 1969), pp. 136-37. 65 This capacity for the weave of lexicography is amenable also to St Peter. His refusal to Rosamond of the Outland money is patrician and highly mannered, a refusal to have his friendship 'translated into the vulgar tongue' (PH, p. 62). His invocation of the two etymological strands of vulgar (vulgus as 'the common people', and vulgare as 'to make public') looks forward to the Mass which provides the occasion for his conversation with Augusta and prompts the idea of the Vulgate itself. St Peter's worry throughout is precisely this issue of translation, of wanting Outland to remain as his story, but acknowledging the need also to edit the private diary for publication and to render the 'Story' public. The tensions between the two locate the nature of the crisis witnessed by the novel. And it is striking that the modernism St Peter leans towards should include Pound's 1909 use of the public strand of this same phrase in praising Whitman: 'Like Dante he wrote in the "vulgar tongue", in a new metric. The first great man to write in the language of his people' ('What I feel About Walt Whitman', Selected Prose I9og-I965, ed. by William Cookson (London: Faber and Faber, 1973), p. 1i6). 4</page><page sequence="29">40 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' modernism of St Peter's tidiness (PH, pp. i6-i 7), and the Catholicism of his absent French-Canadian father. Her reliability is reflected in her solid physicality - 'stiff' is the adjective that is frequently associated with her (PH, pp. 23, 98) - but it is not to be confused with the ordinariness of the stolid.66 Her first entry into the attic is a physical surprise: 'How astonishing that he had not heard her heavy, deliberate tread on the now uncarpeted stair!' a surprise emphasized by her exit as St Peter hears 'her well-known tread as she descended the stairs' (PH, pp. 19, 25). Her non-ordinary reliability is further pointed by her dislike of the contemporary fashion for the 'false hair that's in all the shop windows', matching St Peter's distaste for the sham and the secondary (PH, pp. 23-24). Above all, Augusta is assoc- iated with a new world of mutuality, through her intimacy with St Peter's arena of work. It is a world which offers a possibility for restoring the relational without the complications and obligations of the sexual and the family, removed from 'cruel biological necessities'. Her capacity for nur- turing renders her as the non-biological mother, mediating between the other mothers of the novel: Lillian, whom St Peter sees as wholly caught by the secondary world of acquisitiveness,67 'Mother Eve,' the victim of male fears about sexual infidelity, and Mary who writes the beginning of a new phase in history. These are the features which allow Augusta to be a redemptive figure, someone who, in Oehlschlaeger's summary, offers the 'service' that is given out of independence, not servility, a 'life with others', and a 'commitment to bodily life in time' which contrasts with St Peter's 'transcendent freedom' 66 Augusta's reliability is emphasized by a name which evokes Roman majesty and venerability. We should note also that her Latin name in conjuction with her German ancestry not only salvages the solid from the stolid, but renders her a suitable figure for the shift in immigration patterns (from Germanic and Celtic stock to an increase in Latin and Slavic stock) during the late nineteenth century (George Brown Tindall and David E. Shi, America: A Narrative History (New York: Norton, 1989), p. 522). Augusta thus partakes of both old and new: and it is tempting to suggest that her genealogy combines with St Peter's 'mixed stock' - 'Canadian French on one side, and American farmers on the other' (PH, p. 12) - and with the border territory of the novel's setting on the shore of Lake Michigan, in order to give biological and geographical figuration for the novel's tensile territories in general. It is worth emphasizing also that Augusta's principal activity, weaving, not only provides an important model for St Peter's explorations into composition, but also invokes a type of active female patience together with the virtues of loyalty, devotion, and integrity: that special form of creativity evidenced in the earlier weaving of Odysseus's Penelope. 67 Lillian is most closely associated with the contemporaneity of Marsellus. The Marsellus house is ironically sited on the shore of the Lake Michigan St Peter recalls from his childhood, and it is a model for the distorted harmony of foreign imitativeness that provides another version of the 'messiness' generally despised by St Peter and Outland (PH, p. 39). The house is another of the novel's translations: of the money earned by the development of the Outland engine into naming the house 'Outland' and into creating the house as a 'memorial' by using 'that money as he would have wished' (PH, pp. 40-42). In short, we have the vivid realization of St Peter's fears for translation into 'the vulgar tongue,' where the Marsellus house realizes also the fears of another house, the house constructed by authentic American selfhood in Emerson's 'Self-Reliance'. Emerson associated imitativeness with the secondariness of the social laws regulating property, laws which he contrasted with Lockean notions of 'living property', the form of organic harmony that organizes both the 'house' of the American artist and the design of Outland's stone city ('Self-Reliance', in Selected Writings ofEmerson, ed. by Donald McQuade (New York: Random House, 1981), pp. 149-50.

She thus accommodates the values of the self-reliant, the relational, and the social, values which counter the privatizing, singular, and patrician lines of the St Peter/Outland narrative in its privileging of a site of origin that is solitary, non-relational, aggressively (and at points, violently) masculine, non-female and contemptuous of any translation into the public 'vulgar tongue' of 'chemicals and dollars and cents'. But while the novel may encourage these schisms, it does so only through the attraction and danger of the discourses deployed by St Peter and Outland: it does not allow anything so crude as an ascendancy of one against the other, but, rather, cultivates, through Augusta, processes of modification and mediation, of the weaving St Peter practices on the Litany which, as we have seen, reveals a process of renegotiation in action, alert to both possibilities and limitations without the triumphalism of victory - the novel is much too quiet and too sophisticated for trumpets. Augusta is in the family but not ofit: she is the exemplary figure of the novel's general resistance to the biological and a 'remedial influence' who finally provides a necessary 'comfort' for St Peter (PH, pp. 279-80). Her 'comfort' belongs to another strand of modernist aesthetics, the 'antisepsis' that for Pound, in 1913, derived from 'the art of diagnosis and the art of cure'. The new authenticity which came from such 'antisepsis' was a beauty that was 'not slither, not sentimentalizing', and it resisted the secondariness of 'shams'.68 In Augusta's 'remedial' hands it becomes 'like the taste of bitter herbs' (PH, p. 28o) and her expression shares the unsentimentalizing straight talk that for Pound marked good writing: she 'talked about death as she spoke of a hard winter or a rainy March' (PH, p. 281) in a style which joins the modernist austerity of Outland's diary and offers a 'seasoned' reality to supplant that of the lost Kansas boyhood and to instigate a reconstructed sense of obligation whereby St Peter can become 'outward bound' (PH, p. 281). The solitary, phallocentric fantasy of origin is recon- structed by Augusta's values of the non-biological and the relational - but, the novel instructs us, at the loss of 'delight' (PH, p. 282). However, to maintain that loss, as Nelson, for example, maintains it, is to see Pound's art of 'diagnosis' and 'cure' as self-cancelling rather than complementary, is to remain within the schisms St Peter himself has enforced prior to the final lessons of Augusta.69 St Peter's new 'fortitude' (PH, p. 283) is at a new beginning where 'obligation' may be released from family and re-enter a 68 'The Serious Artist', Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, ed. with an introduction by T. S. Eliot (London: Faber and Faber, 1960), p. 45. 69 See Nelson, pp. 97-98. Similar views on the opposition between a world of 'delight' and one of 'workaday ministrations' are advanced by Murphy (pp. 71-72) and Thomas (pp. 121-22) who are equally concerned to privilege the former over the latter in terms that come close to the patrician idealism of St Peter himself.</page><page sequence="31">42 Origin and Gender in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House' relational world.70 In this context, it is appropriate that the novel's several other losses should include one that is particular to the reader alone: Outland's diary, which we never read but may assume plays a part in St Peter's construction of his 'Story'. The connexion between the two exposes the further inevitability of the non-relational which attends upon an imagin- ary art-object: just as the fetishization of the past by both St Peter and Outland renders origin as 'solitary', so, following Fredric Jameson, the 'system of relationships' which characterizes a true art-object cannot meet its social responsibilities within the art-object that is imagined within another text.71 The novel's adumbration of loss approximates to the idea of death we have found in Lawrence's reading of Whitman where death is simultaneously necessary and a consequence of what Lawrence called 'merging', of feeling for rather than feeling with. The shift from the former to the latter is the lesson of style proposed by the diary and by Augusta: the modernist style of 'austerity', of 'bitter herbs' that would hope to bring together the arts of 'diagnosis' and 'cure' and acknowledge not a sentimentalized beauty but one which leaves artist and reader 'bucked up'. The essential modesty of this aesthetic is what locates the ending of The Professor's House where, after probing the fantasies of origin, St Peter is prepared to begin again after 'death' with re-weaving, with a translation from the private to the public sphere of a text otherwise lost, Outland's diary, in a modernist reworking of Whitmanian sympathy. St Peter's 'future' indicates an Amercian citizenship that will depend not on the singular, the pure, but on a recasting of adventure from conquest to availablity, from the solitary to the 'obligation' of the relational, from the privatizing of the male to the complex multiplicity of the female. The 'future' is the final word of the novel, and its indetermi- nateness emphasizes not only the difficulties that will continue to face St Peter's project, but also the extent to which the terms wielded against each other by the novel's apparent schisms will not be separated out easily - will, in fact, continue to interfere with each other powerfully: for a novel that has debated the discourses of origin so insistently, endings have to posit begin- nings. These beginnings are not sacred places but sites of renewal, sites of 70 Michaels (pp. 235-36, 237-38) has some fascinating observations on the problematical constructions of 'cultural citizenship' through models of the family. Given the novel's interests in various forms of aesthetic control, what is also pertinent here is Hannah Arendt's thesis of the historical drift at the turn of the century from a political to a social view of the world: the 'social' controlling of the public through the private where the incursion of societas into polis through the models of the household or the family registers what is effectively a shift from debate to conformity. Arendt provides an agile equation for the processes of embourgoisement during the period where the values of the political - debate, openness, multiplicity - are in battle with those of the social - conformity, professionalization, specialization, singleness (for a brilliant application of Arendt's thesis to American cultural conditions, see Clive Bush, Halfwiay to Revolution: Investigation and Crisis in the Work of Henry Adams, William James and Gertrude Stein (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991), passim). The extent to which The Professor's House engages with these same terms shows clearly the range of Cather's cultural anxieties. 71 Fredric Jameson, Marxism and Form: Twentieth-Century Dialectical Theories of Literature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1971), pp. 131-32.</page><page sequence="32">IAN F.
