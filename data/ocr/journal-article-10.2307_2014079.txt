My considerations are "limited" to naturalism-one must set a limit somewhere-and I have found naturalism far from limiting. The material I shall use is familiar to every one, but I believe the attempt is seldom made to present impartially the crucial implica- tions of conflicting views. I I can make no objections to Mr. Sellars' system of critical realism, but having a weakness for exact statement I find some fault with his presentation of his system in places. For example, though he always emphasizes the being of the subject self in nature, he usually, at least by implication, leaves subjective factors-i.e., factors in the self such as logical identity, relations, percepts, and universals- outside of nature. "In" expresses a transitive relation. Again, I agree with him that, though a certain branch of mathematical physics may be interested in only external relations of highly abstract en- tities, most science-viz., the rest of physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology-is interested in dynamic systems, systems related in- ternally; but I can not for that reason deny, as he seems to in places, the existence of innumerable external relations in nature, and in nature independently of thought or perception. If, as Russell and Whitehead suggest, every electron is in dynamical relation with every other electron, nevertheless, every electron is in a number of external relations to every other electron, and various dynamic systems are in numerous external relations to various other dynamic systems. The only other fault I find with Mr. Sellars' presentation is the fault present in most philosophical arguments; viz., the failure to consider at least tentatively incompatible systems. Mr. Broad fur- nishes a delightful exception, and (what one is inclined to believe to be due to a concomitant characteristic) indicates a possible em- pirical method of deciding on a realistic epistemological view simply by determining the independent physical causes of perception." Most philosophers as a rule seem not to realize that the epistemo- logical question may some day be settled by crucial experiments. If they realized this, they would assume a more tentative attitude to- ward their own epistemological prejudices. However, because of my naturalistic tendencies my own epis- temological prejudices are, I fear, rather narrow. Besides Mr. Sellars' dualistic epistemology, I entertain a naive view of percep- tion on the order of Professor McGilvary's. But I can not, merely to make all knowledge intuitional, follow the new realists in hypos- tatizing an eternal realm of essences or subsistent entities the va- rious members of which, according to Mr. Holt at least, seem to 1 Scientific Thought, Ch. XIII.</page><page sequence="3">628 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY jump about to meet their subject knowers. And no more appetizing or empirical are Mr. Montague 'S2 memory and forecasting energies which jump out into the now non-existent past or the as yet non- existent future to come in contact with their objects. Knowledge may not be either intuitional (new realism) or symbolic (pragma- tism): it may be, as James showed, a little of each. Furthermore, I do not see how, from a hodgepodge 3 of relatively concrete uni- versals externally related, can be "deduced" dynamic systems in- ternally related. Mr. Holt's view presupposes, besides his mysteri- ous realm of universals, that all sciences are reducible to physics or at least to the elements of physics plus other elements. Now the gestalt psychologists have shown that organization is not necessarily a function of elements. Dr. K6hler says 4: "The starting point [of the gestalt problem] was the observation that sensory fields are re- plete with qualities and properties which one neglects if one takes 'sensations' as their sole content and which, indeed, may have a mysterious aspect when first viewed in this way." (I am anxiously waiting for biologists to shift a little of their interest from genes to configurations.) Thus it seems to me that any theory of analysis which limits itself to an analysis into elements is too narrow to meet empirical demands. Such a theory confuses logical analysis with ontological analysis. The only arguments I know of for a realm of essence, other than Mr. Montague's fatuous claim 5 that it reconciles all epistemological differences, are (1) that it permits knowledge to be intuitional and (2) that it is necessary for logical identity and thought. Mr. Sellars 6 has disposed of the first need as has Professor McGilvary.7 They show that factors in our experience, mean, point to, or symbolize factors outside of our experience. These objects of ideas which may or may not have been in our experience were existing, are existing, shall be existing, or never exist.8 The fact that so many first-rate thinkers do not experience the second need, that eternal essences are necessary for thought, makes the young naturalist hesitant about making such a sweeping assumption. I can not see why indistin- guishable similarities are not as sufficient for thought as are logical identities or why the latter can not be reduced to the former (onto- logically) just as well as the former to the latter (logically).

(1914).</page><page sequence="4">ARGUMENT FOR EPIPHENOMENALISM 629 prejudice to assume a priori that the order of being must correspond to logical order. Logical identity is logically prior to indistinguish- able similarity because the former is logically simpler than the latter. Ontologically, however, logical identity is much more com- plex than indistinguishable similarity because the former demands its eternal realm when given ontological priority. And I prefer ontological simplicity where it is sufficient to meet the empirical demands to the presumption that the order of being corresponds to, or is, logical order. I do not know any more reasons for assuming that the universe corresponds to logical order than for assuming that it corresponds to a Hegelian Dialectic order. The development of Mr. Russell's hint 9 that logical and mathematical proofs are tautol- ogies (nevertheless valuable and indispensable to empirical investi- gation) rather than ontological "activities," such as Mr. Holt be- lieves them to be, might simplify considerably an ontology which, without the eternal realm, is complex enough to satisfy the serious- minded metaphysician. However, as I have hinted, I have no more patience with Mr. Sellars' rejection of a naive view of perception than I have with Mr. Holt's 10 disparaging rejection of epistemological dualism. Mr. Holt,"1 Mr. Broad,'2 and many others have disposed of the Berkeley thesis that variability proves subjectivity. The only argument I know of for rejecting the view that the contents of perception have existence independently of being perceived and when perceived are external in space to the perceiving organism (hereafter called the naYve view) is the fact that psychology has been unable to work under such an assumption. Mr. H. B. English is one of the few psychologists who consider the naive approach. He says 13: " Sensa can not be identified with parts or aspects of physical things, we are told, because of the non-veridical nature of some perceptions. Strictly speaking that is the case. Only we ought to begin our analysis with the perception, illusory or not, rather than with the reflectively abstracted sensa. And then the true statement seems to be, not that percepta are parts or aspects of the physical thing, but that the physical thing is part or aspect of the perceptum." Unfortunately his approach is apparently from an arm-chair only. However, as Mr. Broad has indicated,'4 the question may be settled empirically.

XIII.</page><page sequence="5">630 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY assumption may be due to the immature state of psychology as a science and possibly to the prejudice that it is "impossible" for the mind to be extended in physical space-time outside the physical or- ganism. Mr. Russell says: '15 "We cannot, without a preposterous kind of discontinuity, suppose that the physiologist's percept, which comes at the end of this [causal] series, is anywhere else but in the physiologist's head." Such a discontinuity, however, is "prepos- terous" only in the framework of Mr. Russell's physics. But psy- chology and physics are not identical sciences. Furthermore, Mr. Bridgman has shown ll that causal discontinuity is far from pre- posterous even in physics. Mr. Russell's statement presupposes, too, a narrow theory of continuous causal series. Mr. Broad has clearly shown 17 that independent causes may occur sometime before their results in time and separated from their results in space even though there be dependent or other independent causes intervening to form a continuous series. Whenever Mr. Sellars considers epiphenomenalism in his Evolu- tionary Naturalism, he identifies it with the view that the organism is a mechanical automaton. His book is devoted to the attractive thesis that the organism is a dynamic system rather than a me- chanical conglomeration of elements. Now perhaps in most pres- entations of epiphenomenalism the writer does consider the physical organism as a mechanical automaton, but may not the physical organism be a dynamic system of which consciousness is an epiphe- nomenal decoration? In such a case the human organism would not be an automaton governed by external forces, but a self-deter- mining dynamic system which biology and psychology recognize it to be. The organism would, however, be just as efficient a system and would behave and function without consciousness the same as it does with epiphenomenal consciousness-providing, of course, that consciousness could be removed from it without much changing the dynamic physical organization, as is not the case except as it is approached in some instances of hypnosis. Now the biological inclinations of a naturalist tend to cause him to distrust pure decorations, and this distrust is the only argument I know against epiphenomenalism. Of course, the fact that the only immediate knowledge we have of the stuff of the universe is the stuff revealed in consciousness-e.g., configurations, colors, sounds, tactile qualities, etc.-may indicate that there is no radical differ- ence in substance between physical stuff and conscious stuff. Yet '5 Philosophy, p. 140. 16 The Logic of Modern Physics. 17 Scientific Thought, p. 501 if.</page><page sequence="6">ARGUMENT FOR EPIPHENOMENALISM 631 the fact that hardness is so different from the esthetic pleasure I experience when viewing a lovely sunset suggests, as we shall see in the next paragraph, that the argument between epiphenomenalism and interactionism is not fatuous. Epiphenomenalism must assume that physical stuff can behave under certain conditions of dynamic relatedness in complex enough ways to meet the demands of the biologist and psychologist. I know no reasons against such an as- sumption. Now where we do have fairly precise knowledge of dynamic sys- tems-viz., in chemistry and physics and of lower organisms where the biologist does not assume the efficacy of consciousness-we find that our explanatory concepts are of the nature of hardness and ef- fort; e.g., such concepts as inertia, force, and energy. Configuration, intensity, and extension are about the only concepts we can apply somewhat in common to both our experience of dynamic systems and of esthetic reactions. In other words man's experience falls into two classes which may be called the "higher" and "lower" experiences, and from these "lower" experiences have grown most of the scientific concepts. For this reason configuration and in- tensity have been sadly neglected in the sciences until recently. The concepts which come out of our "lower" experiences have been re- fined and made precise by indirect and sophisticated methods, sci- entific method; but I do not believe science has abolished them. I am enough the naturalist to resent primitive anthropomorphism, but I resent also the superficial rejection of arguments on the ground that they are anthropomorphic. The enthusiastic naturalist often forgets that if man is a product of nature, nature must be " anthropo- morphic " enough to account for man. The fear of anthropo- morphism is largely responsible for the theoretical neglect, until recently, of dynamic systems in nature. I am of the opinion that force and energy are as real unexperienced as they are experienced. Most naturalists hesitate to discard the concept of extension from their explanations, yet surely that is an anthropomorphic concept. The criterion of, the validity of an explanatory concept is not whether or not it is anthropomorphic, but whether it allows of prediction and control. Thus, since most of the scientific explanatory concepts have come from our "lower" experiences, it may be that our ex- periences reveal to us the nature of the stuff of dynamically be- having substance as being different from the stuff of the "higher" experiences. It is because there are various satisfactory naturalistic solutions to the problems of epistemology and substance that I advocate a tentative consideration of various solutions until more empirical de- cisions can be made. The answer to the objection from biology that</page><page sequence="7">632 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY epiphenomenal consciousness is purely decorative and therefore of no biological utility is this: The nature of nature may be such that certain complex dynamic relations can not occur without being ac- companied by decorative features (non-causal features). It is im- possible to give an example of such features from science because science is interested only in causal sequences and as a matter of fact has no means of discovering such features outside of experience fields. Within experience such non-active features are numerous unless we assume that they are epiphenomenal to some kind of phe- nomenon. Mirror images which we barely see as we pass in front of a window and immediately forget, fleeting colors, odors, and sounds which apparently leave us unaffected are a few of the numer- ous examples which could be given. Mr. Sellars quotes 18 the following objection to epiphenomenalism made by Mr. Lovejoy: 19 "Never, surely, did a sillier or more self- stultifying idea enter the human mind, than the idea that thinking as such-that is to say, remembering, planning, reasoning, forecast- ing-is a vast irrelevancy, having no part in the causation of man's behavior or in the shaping of his fortunes-a mysterious redundancy in a cosmos which would follow the same course without it." Such an objection finds no application to an epiphenomenalism which does not belittle the activities of the physical organism, an epiphenome- nalism which does not hesitate to admit that the laws of the physics and chemistry of the living organism are very different from the laws of the physics and chemistry of non-living matter or of dead organisms. Even the interactionist, if Mr. Sellars is a typical rep- resentative,20 admits the difference between the chemistry of dead and living organisms. And epiphenomenalism need not deny the efficacy of thinking as such. It merely denies that thinking is ef- ficacious if it is not a physiological as well as a (partially) conscious process. Professor McGilvary has shown 21 how the application of causal categories to concomitant psychic factors may be consistent with epiphenomenalism. In terms of a dynamic theory of the phys- ical organism, meaning as conscious is the psychic decoration of certain dynamic physical wholes, and meaning as a causal factor in human experience is these certain dynamic physical wholes. I believe there is one argument in favor of epiphenomenalism which satisfies our desire for biological utility. It is as easy to con- ceive of the attainment of survival value through the use of natural 18 Evolutionary Naturalism, p. 312.

(1910).</page><page sequence="8">ARGUMENT FOR EPIPHENOMENALISM 633 processes which involve decorative concomitants as through the use of a unique dynamical substance. It is simpler to look for emergent properties (modes of behavior of physical stuff) from new organiza- tions than from new substances. A new property may emerge from a total organization (a dynamic physical whole) without an emergent dynamic substance. If certain unique emergent properties prove always to be conscious, then those emergent properties may be called "conscious properties"; but the question of substance still remains; for if any naturalistic meaning at all can be found for "substance," I think it is applicable to some of the contents of consciousness; it remains for physics to decide if it is applicable to factors outside of consciousness, and for philosophy to decide how different or sim- ilar the meanings are. The universe may consist of dynamic proc- esses and qualities, some of the latter being contents of consciousness whenever they exist (dual view) or (naive view) part of the time they exist. III I do not see that the choice of a naive or dual theory of percep- tion has, at present, any bearing on the choice of interactionism or epiphenomenalism or vice versa. If the naive view of perception and interactionism furnishes the correct theory, then obviously there is such a thing as a discontinuous causal series in nature-preposterous or not. On the other hand since the naive view supposes the stuff of the physical world to be hardnesses, colors, sounds, etc.-i.e., the stuff of sensa, though not sensations-the interaction would not be between substances of very different natures. If the naive view and epiphenomenalism furnish the correct theory, then there is not necessarily a discontinuous causal series, but there are discontinuous psychic phenomena. If the dual view of perception and interactionism furnish the correct theory, then until we know more about the nature of physical substance we can not know how different the interacting substances are. The weakest point of this theory may seem to be the fact that our "lower" experiences have yielded the concepts of science. Thus they may very likely be closely analogous to the stuff of the physical world, and it is as simple to conceive of nature as making them identical as to conceive something of a Lockian copy theory. The critical realist will insist that percepts are not copies but are very different from the physical object, but he has no proof of this dif- ference. Mr. Pitken shows that some biological phenomena such as the conductive reaction of the stimulus in the flatfish argue an "approximate identity between the stimulus and the conductive re-</page><page sequence="9">634 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY action. " 22 Such evidence is restricted to the functions of the "higher" senses, but I know of no evidence against the assumption of numerical identity in the "lower" senses between stimulus and experienced quality. However, if they are found to be numerically distinct, they may still be closely analogous. The naive view may apply to some of our percepts and the dual view to others. The same weakness and the same compensatory considerations apply to the theory of the dual view and epiphenomenalism. With this theory, however, there is no problem of the origin of a new dynamic substance. We do not know enough about the universe as yet to say definitely whether survival values could be obtained more readily through (1) the development of a psychic substance in the brain to function in interaction with the physical brain to furnish a method of symboliz- ing external reality (dual interactionism), or (2) the development of self-determining processes in the nervous system, some of which involve concomitant psychic factors (dual epiphenomenalism), or (3) the development of physical processes in the nervous system which, in perception, acting in functional harmony with processes outside the organism (in the physical perceived object) involve a concomitant but non-efficacious intuition of the physical world out- side the organism (and within), and, in ideational processes, in- volve psychic "fringes" to physical dynamic wholes (naIve epiphe- nomenalism), or (4) the development of interacting substances in- volving discontinuous causal series, one substance being related to the other at times in the relationship of awareness in perception, and in ideational processes one substance using itself or the other or both to symbolize factors not present to it (naIve interactionism). My appeal is simply that we do not try to prejudice psychological and biological investigation by refusing a tentative consideration to all the various naturalistic theories. Speculative knowledge should be a lead, not a block, to the attainment of tested knowledge. A desire on the part of philosophers to understand rather than to refute the implications of each theory might serve to reveal valuable fields for further scientific exploitation. HORACE S. FRIES.
