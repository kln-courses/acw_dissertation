DOYEL The University of Arizona ABSTRACT A proposed realignment of State Route 88 near Miami, Arizona, necessitated the excavation of eight small prehistoric sites. Material culture representative of Hohokam, Salado, and Apache occupations was recovered. This recent work has contributed to the refinement of the poorly known chronology for the Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin areas. A new phase, the Miami phase, is introduced for the Globe-Miami area, spanning the time period of around A.D. 1150 to 1200. INTRODUCTION In March of 1974, an archaeological survey of a proposed three mile re-alignment of State Route 88 near Miami located eight prehistoric ruins which would be destroyed by the proposed construction (Figure 1). A contract to conduct archaeological excavation was negotiated by the Arizona State Museum and the Arizona Department of Transportation under the Highway Archaeological Salvage Program. Fieldwork under direction of the author began on May 6, 1974, and terminated on August 12, 1974. A locally recruited labor force was utilized for a total of 750 man days. Fortunately, a number of things worked in favor of the Miami Wash project. We were blessed with a mild summer, enabling the excavations to progress rapidly. A capable supervisory staff and an efficient field laboratory were vital factors contributing to the overall success of the project. The sites investigated were small and inconspicuous and had not been vandalized as have the large Salado pueblos in the area. Although the sites were not systematically chosen, the sample universe being defined by a highway realignment, we were able to obtain indications of prehistoric utilization of the area beginning during the Gila Butte phase and continuing up to the time of Salado abandonment, a period of over 900 years. The majority of the sites excavated were small, multi-component sites of from one to six rooms, overlying earlier pit house structures. The sites yielded large quantities of material for such small sites, including over 50,000 Contribution to Highway Salvage Archaeology in Arizona No. 41 241</page><page sequence="2">242 DOYEL to Roosevelt . ./ LEGEND Proposed *A 0 3200 Right of Way ARIZONA Sites "- Excavated Q MAP 59 All Site Phoenix LOCATION Numbers Preceded By ARIZONA-V9: Tucson 0 3 \ . *. o rl 3300 fee to Mam400 0 300 600 900 0010 m o M oi aI0 300 600 900 Figure 1.

This material has been analyzed and a report is on file at the Arizona State Museum awaiting publication (Doyel n.d.). A dissertation on the chipped stone assemblage has recently been completed (Lavine-Lischka 1975), and a second dissertation concerned with ethnobotanical and paleo-environmental data will soon be completed for the Department of Geosciences at The University of Arizona by Jamie Lytle-Webb. One major focus of the project was to refine the poorly known local chronology. Material culture studies were also emphasized, as we know little about the details of Hohokam and Salado culture history in the area. A third focus of the project was to reconstruct the social and functional aspects of the excavated sites, ultimately contributing to the development of a model of the local subsistence and settlement system (Doyel 1974). Prior to developing such a model, it is imperative to refine and update the chronology and culture history. This later topic will be the subject of this discussion. Dated pottery and archaeomagnetic dates obtained from our excavations form the basis for the chronological reconstruction. ENVIRONMENT The Globe-Miami area is located in proximity to a physiographic and biotic transition zone (Wilson 1962; Doyel 1972). Physiography is char- acterized by rugged mountain ranges of high relief, surrounding relatively narrow drainages (Figure 2). Altitudinal variation is marked. The sites are located along the Pinal Creek and Miami Wash drainages at the 3200 foot contour. Located immediately above the sites are a series of foothills which reach altitudes of 3500 and 3800 feet. The Pinal and Apache Mountains are located nearby, both ranges attaining heights of 7000 feet, and the Pinals approaching 8000 feet at Signal Peak. Plant assemblages are localized and variable. Typical Lower Sonoran species include mesquite, palo verde, acacia, creosote, cottonwood, cholla, sahuaro, barrel cactus, and prickly-pear. Upper Sonoran species include juniper, jojoba, manzanita, mountain mahogany, canotia, scrub oak, agave, sotol, and certain yucca species. Pine forests are located in the Pinal Mountains, only several miles to the south of the project area. Vegetational diversity near the excavated sites is marked, and rather mosaic in pattern. Native fauna was diverse, representing both desert adapted and mountain adapted species (Sparling n.d.). Species represented in the bone collected from the sites include squirrel (Citellus variegatus), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), badger (Taxidea taxus), dog (Canis familiaris), fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), mountain lion (Felis concolor), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and pronghorn antelope (Anti- locapra americana). Numerous birds were also recovered, including quail</page><page sequence="4">244 DOYEL (Lophortyx gambelii), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), falcon (Falco mexi- canus), hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), vulture (Cathartes aura), and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). I have previously suggested (Doyel 1972) that the combination of physiographic, hydrologic, and biotic features present in this region were important factors in the development of the Salado settlement system. Ongoing research is concerned with this interesting subject of cultural and environmental relationships in the Tonto Basin and Globe-Miami area. ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND The rugged mountainous zone of central Arizona encompassing the Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin areas has been the subject of little systematic research. Although the area is well known to vandals, professional looters, and to amateur archaeologists, the professional community knows little about this important area and how it figures into the prehistory of the Southwest. What we have to work with then are a few published reports, a sketchy Figure 2. View of Pinal Creek drainage near study area, Arizona V:9:57 can be seen in left-center. View is looking north toward the Tonto Basin.</page><page sequence="5">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 245 chronology, some indications of relationships, and little knowledge of the processes of culture growth, change, movement, and contact. We know that the Tonto Basin was occupied by preceramic people (Huckell 1973). There appears to be a void between the pre-ceramic occupation and the reoccupation of the area by the Hohokam of the Colonial period, A.D. 500 to 900 (Haury 1932). It has traditionally been maintained that the area was not occupied during the Hohokam Sedentary period, A.D. 900 to 1150, although during a survey Brandes (1957) located sites with Sacaton Red-on-buff and plainware pottery. The Gladwins (1935:27) proposed that around A.D. 1100 to 1150, the Tonto Basin and Globe-Miami areas were colonized by a group of Little Colorado related people, whom they referred to as the Salado. This early phase of Salado culture was to be characterized by small cobble masonry sites enclosed by compounds, Cibola White Ware and later Pinto Polychrome pottery, extended inhumation and cremation burial, and numerous smaller items. Harold Gladwin later proposed (1957) that around A.D. 1250 to 1300 the same area witnessed a new and greater influx of proto-Hopi people who were then responsible for the further Salado development. With this background, I will now present an updated version of the chronology, phase by phase, emphasizing the Globe-Miami area, for this is where the most recent work has been accomplished. PRECERAMIC AND PIONEER PERIOD As of this writing, there is no evidence to suggest a preceramic occupation of the Globe-Miami area, while, as previously mentioned, Huckell has documented such an occupation of the upper Tonto Basin. Recent survey work by the Highway Salvage Section of the Arizona State Museum has recorded a large preceramic site near Punkin Center, also located in the upper Tonto area. It will not be surprisiing if future investigations discover additional evidence for the preceramic occupation of both the Tonto Basin and Globe-Miami areas. There is no good evidence suggesting that the area was inhabited by the Pioneer period Hohokam or any other sedentary cultural group of this time period, although Vickery (1945) did find several sherds of Snaketown Red-on-buff at Inspiration I. This is surprising, as the area had much to offer in the way of both native resources and agricultural potential. Perhaps this is due to the somewhat restrictive nature of the physical environment, as canal irrigation has only limited potential in the Globe-Miami area, whereas the Tonto Basin was more suitable. It is possible that the Hohokam and Mogollon had not developed sufficient population levels to the point of requiring out-migration from the core areas to more peripheral areas such as the transition zone.</page><page sequence="6">246 DOYEL COLONIAL PERIOD, A.D. 500 TO 900 The first recognizable occupation of the Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin areas by sedentary agricultural folk occurred during the Gila Butte phase of the Hohokam Colonial period (A.D. 500 to 700). Our evidence from this early phase is not abundant. Vickery (1945:25) found Gila Butte ceramics at Inspiration I and a small quantity of Gila Butte phase material was found at Roosevelt 9:6 (Haury 1932). The bulk of material from these two sites, however, dates to somewhat later in the Santa Cruz phase. During our recent excavations, Gila Butte Red-on-buff was found in small quantities at three different sites. Two of the sites yielded Gila Butte Red-on-buff without Santa Cruz Red-on-buff, supporting the Gila Basin data that these two types are in fact temporally separable. All three sites yielding this early material were multi-component, and this early material was mixed in with later material. No architecture dating to the Gila Butte phase was discovered, but a transitional Gila Butte-Santa Cruz pit house was excavated at Arizona V:9:62. Since the early ceramic material was mixed with later material, it is difficult to ascertain the nature of this early occupation. At Arizona V:9:56, Gila Butte Red-on-buff was associated with an outside firepit. These limited data may suggest that during this phase, the Globe-Miami area, and possibly the Tonto Basin as well, were utilized on a limited basis. This limited activity may have been directed to seasonal hunting and gathering pursuits, or to the collecting of nearby source materials such as turquoise and other minerals which abound in the area. Trading parties may have passed through the area during this early phase, as both Haury (1940:85) and Hammack (1969:79) found Gila Butte Red-on-buff at Forestdale. The Santa Cruz phase of the Colonial period is better documented for the area. Haury's (1932) work at Roosevelt 9:6 in the Tonto Basin has documented the presence of a sizeable village during this phase. Santa Cruz phase sites have recently been found in the northern Tonto Basin (Haas 1971) and even in the wooded country northeast of the Tonto Basin (Morris 1970). At present, Inspiration I represents the only excavated Santa Cruz phase village site in the Globe-Miami area. Our limited survey accomplished during the recent work recorded what may be a small Santa Cruz or Sacaton phase village site located on a terrace above Pinal Creek. A transitional Gila Butte-Santa Cruz phase pit house was excavated at Arizona V:9:62 (Figure 3). Artifactual material associated with this structure was oriented towards plant processing. No domesticated plant remains were found in the flotation samples taken from the floor and features in this structure, and our pollen results are not yet available. It is not known whether the Hohokam were using native plants, domesticated plants, or both during this early time period.</page><page sequence="7">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 247 Other sites in the area have also documented Santa Cruz phase utilization. McGuire (n.d.) found some evidence for Hohokam occupation of the Central Heights site during this phase, underlying a Gila phase Salado component. Windmiller (1972a) excavated a Santa Cruz phase campsite in the nearby Pinto Creek drainage. GILA PHASE "***** ...... .. I .***** * I ..... too, --- ".:'""..:.-." 1300- 1450 I.* .".-..'.

Evidence for village-farming sites in this area is not as good as for the Tonto Basin. However, the data minimally suggest that the Globe-Miami area was utilized seasonally by small family groups. Brandes (1957a) reported a Santa Cruz phase ballcourt from Ranch Creek, located some ten miles east of Globe-Miami. This evidence does suggest that we may eventually find more evidence of late Colonial period occupation of the Globe-Miami area. The above discussion indicates that the Colonial period represented a time of range expansion by the Hohokam, with the attempt to transplant the Hohokam lifeway into more northern and eastern zones. This conclusion agrees well with work accomplished in numerous other localities in the transition zone to the north of the Hohokam core area, documented by the work at the Henderson site (Weed and Ward 1970), at the Beardsley Canal site (Weed 1972), and in the Verde Valley (Breternitz 1960). SACATON PHASE, SEDENTARY PERIOD, A.D. 900 TO 1150 The Miami Wash project contributed substantially to our knowledge of the Sacaton phase in the Globe-Miami area. I am unaware of any Sacaton phase site which has been excavated, except for the Central Heights site, currently unpublished, which appears to have been occupied during the Sacaton phase. Three Sacaton phase structures were excavated during our project, with single structures found at three different sites (Arizona V:9:55, 56, and 57). Architectural variability is apparent, ranging from oval structures with either one or two main beams, to a large sub-circular plan with a single center beam (Figure 3). One oval structure had a front, centered doorway without an entryway passage, while the other had the usual bulbous entryway, but located at a corner of the structure. An archaeomagnetic date of A.D. 1090 (1090 a 25, DuBois #947) was obtained from a hearth in this latter structure. Sacaton Red-on-buff, Sacaton Red, and Gila shouldered Gila Plain, both mica and schist tempered, are the diagnostic pottery types associated with this phase. Snowflake Black-on-white is consistently associated as an intrusive type. At present, the Sacaton phase occupation appears limited to small sites located near the drainages. However, the possibility of a Sacaton phase village site has already been mentioned, and it is possible that these smaller sites represent satellite units associated with a larger village. Plant processing tools represent the bulk of associated items, but again no domesticates were recovered from flotation. Pigweed (Amaranthus sp.), buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima), cheno-ams, and unidentified legumes were recovered (Hall n.d.). The plant remains suggest at least seasonal</page><page sequence="9">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 249 occupation, but whether or not the occupation was permanent remains to be determined. Whatever the Sacaton phase pattern represents, it is now documented through excavation that there was a Sacaton phase occupation of the Globe-Miami area. No sites dating to this phase have been found in the Tonto Basin, but if they were present, they are now under water in Roosevelt lake. The Vosberg district, located to the northeast of the Tonto, did witness a substantial Sacaton phase occupation (A. E. Dittert, Jr., personal communica- tion) and it is likely that the Tonto Basin did as well. MIAMI PHASE, A.D. 1150 TO 1200 Shortly after the end of the Sacaton phase, the Globe-Miami area was occupied for a short time by a little known cultural group. Only a single site which revealed this phase of occupation was excavated (Figure 4), but combined with other work in the area, we can tentatively propose a new phase as an attempt to interpret this new information. Specifically, this new phase extends from around A.D. 1150 to around 1200, and represents a period between the late Hohokam and the early Salado occupations of the Globe-Miami area. Following tradition, the parameters of this new phase as they are now understood are outlined below. Miami Phase Description Area: Known in the vicinity of Globe-Miami, and extending west to the Pinto Creek area, at present. Age: Estimated inclusive dates based on cross-dated pottery and a single archaeomagnetic date (A.D. 1180 + 39, DuBois #948) is A.D. 1150 to-1200, possibly extending somewhat earlier and later. Excavated Sites: Arizona V:9:57, and possibly Arizona V:9:14 (Windmiller 1974). Environment: Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, elevation approximately 3000 to 3500 feet. Architecture: Small sites located on ridges above drainages. Surface and pit room architecture, non-contiguous, but grouped within an enclosing (Arizona V:9:57) or compound wall (Arizona V:9:14). Wall construction either coursed, unshaped masonry reinforced with mortar with wattle-and-daub superstructure, or adobe with stone reinforcing (Figure 5). Corner, side, or end doorways, floors not plastered, with circular clay-lined fire hearths. Storage pits may occur in extramural areas, few floor features. Economy: Combination of agricultural and hunting and gathering pursuits. Pottery: Indigenous: Gila Plain, Gila Red. Intrusive: Snowflake Black-on-white (dominant intrusive type), St. Johns Polychrome, McDonald Corrugated, Little Colorado White Ware, San Carlos Red-on-brown, Reserve-Tularosa Black-on-white (Figure 6). Ground and Pecked Stone: Three-quarter-grooved axe, unifacial and bifacial manos, full trough metate with some basin types, pestles, handstones, hammerstones, stone vessels.</page><page sequence="10">250 DOYEL /hearth 0 firepit a 4m" burial A storage O pit 0 Scale meters z 6m cPB 0 8 o0Room 3 O( 00 0 eC79 o RoomI 2292 0 00* Room o00 0002 4m R 8 00 y~/bedrock A 0 000 N ~ortars 000 oco a ,o Rmom ARIZONA V 9:57 0 Room 2 A s r 000 0088 0 1o /Om COLUMBUS SITE ARIZONA V-9:57 Figure 4.

Pottery, shell, bone, and stone artifacts associated (Figure 8). Remarks: Additional work should refine the phase and possibly add to the material culture inventory. Temporal placement is firm between A.D. 1150 and 1200, but may extend somewhat in either direction. Currently, the phase exists only in the Globe-Miami and Pinto Creek areas. This new phase is introduced in a tentative fashion and may not represent any final solution for the area, but it does appear to best interpret the facts available today. Discussion This new phase does indeed represent a mixed cultural pattern, with numerous puebloan elements combined with a Classic period Hohokam plain and redware ceramic assemblage. Furthermore, this phase possesses a number of elements traditionally thought to be Saladoan, such as extended burials, Figure 5. Room 2, Arizona V:9:57. Circular clay-lined hearth and remnants of a pollen column in center of room. Note enclosing wall behind room. . ... ... 10, /F . . . . . . . . .</page><page sequence="12">252 DOYEL cobble masonry, and enclosing walls, suggesting that we will have to refine what it is that is uniquely Saladoan. The Miami phase offers good evidence for permanent occupation of the Globe-Miami area. This inference is based upon the following evidence found at Arizona V:9:57: a variable ceramic assemblage consisting of large storage and cooking jars as well as the smaller cooking and serving vessels, large storage pits, quantities of trash, numerous burials, substantial architecture, a diverse faunal assemblage consisting of both food and ceremonially utilized species, and a tool kit reflecting a variety of activities. This phase is only documented at one site along a major drainage, and no other sites of this phase were located during our survey. However, such sites would be difficult to identify from surface evidence, especially if they are multi-component as was Arizona V:9:57. A reasonable reconstruction of this phase might be to visualize a sparse population, with permanent sites located along the major drainages and seasonal sites in less favorable areas, such as Windmiller's (1974) Scorpion Ridge ruin located along the Pinto Creek drainage. Subsistence pursuits would include collecting numerous native plants; we found heron-bill (Erodium texanum), acorn (Quercus gambelii), deer-vetch (Lotus sp.), globe-mallow (Sphaeralcea sp.), and hackberry (Celtis reticulata). The hunting of native Figure 6. Sherds of Snowflake Black-on-white associated with Miami phase at Arizona V:9:57. Bottom right is 11 cm in width.</page><page sequence="13">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 253 fauna would have been important, as would farming along the floodplain and arroyos using either floodwater or groundwater farming techniques. The presence of a similar phase in the Tonto Basin is presently unknown. According to the Gladwins, this time period was thought to be the beginning of the Salado occupation, which is at least ceramically quite distinct from the Miami phase. I personally feel that the Gladwinian reconstruction can be seriously questioned on chronological as well as other grounds, at least for the Globe-Miami area. Only additional excavation will clarify the archaeological situation in the Tonto Basin around this time period of A.D. 1150 to 1200. ROOSEVELT PHASE, A.D. 1200 TO 1300 As mentioned, the Gladwins proposed that the earliest, or Roosevelt phase of Salado occupation of the Tonto Basin and Globe-Miami areas began around A.D. 1100 to 1150, initiated by the movement of Little Colorado people into these areas. The Roosevelt phase began with the arrival of the people from the northeast and is defined as possessing the following diagnostic traits: Roosevelt Figure 7. Zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines of the Miami phase. Stylized rams head is made of stone while the human figure is ceramic. Figure on right is 7 cm in height.</page><page sequence="14">254 DOYEL Black-on-white and Pinto Polychrome pottery, compounds with one story building construction with boulder foundations, three-quarters groove axes, trough metates, one-sided manos, well made notched indented base arrow points, copper bells, jewelry of shell, turquoise and bone including bracelets, beads and ornaments, inhumation and cremation burial within the compound (Gladwin and Gladwin 1935:27). It is immediately apparent that many of their "diagnostic" traits are not diagnostic at all. Secondly, one is hard pressed to find a donor area in the Little Colorado area that fits the above description. It does appear that some of the elements mentioned above are of Hohokam origin, probably survivals from the preceding Miami phase populations. Nevertheless, Gladwin later suggested (1957:249) that a pre-polychrome Salado horizon probably does exist in the heartland area, and he mentions the existence of small cobble masonry sites and Cibola White Ware (Roosevelt Black-on-white?) in Six Shooter canyon near Globe. None of these sites have been either recently visited or excavated, indicating that we must withhold judgement on the validity of this pre-polychrome horizon of the Roosevelt phase until more Of 2o W011 ~MEM ON 71OOF4 R a . ... ..... ...

Arrow points north.</page><page sequence="15">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 255 work is done. The bulk of the evidence suggests that the A.D. 1100 to 1150 date may be a little early, especially for the Globe-Miami area, wherein the pre-Salado (as Salado is currently defined) Miami phase is thought to extend until around A.D. 1200. The date of A.D. 1200 is more in accord with recent findings (Johnson 1965:57). It is common knowledge that both the dating of the Roosevelt phase and the type ceramics for the phase are not well understood. Pinto Polychrome, the recognized ceramic criterion for the Roosevelt phase, has been dated by Colton and Hargrave (1937) to fall between A.D. 1150 and 1250, while Breternitz (1966) has suggested a date of A.D. 1200 to 1348. Breternitz states that Gila Pueblo and Tonto National Monument are the type sites for Pinto Polychrome. He then lists sites where Pinto Polychrome is thought to be present as an intrusive type, and these include Kinishba, Showlow ruin, and some of the sites recorded by Haury in the Sierra Ancha. Haury (personal communication) has informed me that there was no Pinto Polychrome at Gila Pueblo, as the site is a pure Gila phase site. Gladwin (1957:321) is in agreement with this, but Shiner (1961) did find a few sherds when he excavated a single room. Haury has also informed me that Pinto Polychrome was not found in the lower level at the Showlow ruin, as Breternitz implies. Pinto Polychrome was found only in small quantity as sherds at Tonto National Monument and in the Sierra Ancha sites (Steen 1962; Haury 1934), and Pinto Polychrome was found at Kinishba and Grasshopper (A.D. 1275 to 1400), but the dominant type was Gila Polychrome. The majority of these sites then represent a later time period from which only a few sherds of Pinto Polychrome are present. Since all of these sites were occupied shortly before or at A.D. 1300, it appears that this is a reasonable end date for Pinto Polychrome. There is no evidence for the presence of Pinto Polychrome at any site with absolute dates falling before A.D. 1200. The end dates for pottery types thought to be ancestral to Pinto Polychrome, such as Tularosa Black-on-white and St. Johns Polychrome, fall around A.D. 1250. Following this outline, the dating of the poorly understood Roosevelt phase appears to fall squarely within the 13th century. If we place an end date on the newly introduced Miami phase at A.D. 1200, the above reconstruction conforms quite well, at least for the Globe-Miami area. We did not find a single component Roosevelt phase site in our recent excavations. However, three sites were excavated which yielded Roosevelt phase ceramics, consisting of Pinto Polychrome, Pinto Black-on-red, Salado Red, St. Johns Polychrome, Pinedale Black-on-red, and small quantities of black-on-white pottery which conforms typologically to Roosevelt Black-on- white. These three sites are small, with one to four crude cobble rooms without enclosing walls, located on terraces overlooking Miami Wash (Figure 9). These sites appear to be oriented toward agricultural and other</page><page sequence="16">256 DOYEL activities, and were utilized during both the Roosevelt and the later Gila phases. At one of these sites, Arizona V:9:56, we found a small quantity of Pinto Polychrome which exhibited a whiteware paste with a thin fugitive exterior red slip. The majority of this early polychrome was, however, made of the local brownware paste and temper. We have then a small amount of evidence which suggests a local transition from a whiteware to a brownware ceramic technology. The Miami Wash project then did gain evidence supporting a Roosevelt phase occupation of the Miami Wash area. Vickery (1939) was able to define a Roosevelt phase component at Besh-ba-gowa, which appears to have been a permanently occupied pueblo during this phase.

Burial goods did reveal a consistent association of Roosevelt Black-on-white and Pinto Polychrome for the Roosevelt phase. This information coupled with the results of the Miami Wash project, suggests that variability in site size and function may be expected for this early phase. Settlement pattern however does appear to consistently favor bottomland or riverine locations, much like the Miami phase, indicating that agriculture was a strong factor in locating settlements. Given that the Roosevelt phase begins as the Miami phase terminates, we can now speculate on the nature of the transition between the two phases. We have seen that the Miami phase contained a number of features thought to be Saladoan hallmarks, including such things as extended burials, cobble masonry architecture, and compound and enclosing walls. It is apparent then that the Miami phase architectural pattern is quite similar in some respects to the later Salado pattern. Ceramic evidence argues for some continuity between the Miami and Roosevelt phases. Some of the plainware from the Miami phase component at Arizona V:9:57 is transitional between typical Gila Plain and the later Salado type Tonto Plain. Several individuals have also noted the similarity between these two pottery types (Shiner 1961; Windmiller 1972). The redware assemblages provide even more evidence of continuity. A lineal relationship has been suggested to exist between the Gila Red of the Miami phase and a later redware type found on all the Salado sites we excavated (Doyel n.d.). Along with these aforementioned shared characteristics, there are also differences between the Miami and Roosevelt phases. Along with certain architectural changes, striking differences reside in the respective ceramic assemblages. The Roosevelt phase ceramic component is characterized by Tonto Plain, Tonto Corrugated (primarily an obliterated corruaged), Salado Red, Pinto Polychrome, Pinto Black-on-red, and a new redware type designated Inspiration Red and by Roosevelt Black-on-white. Along with these changes are numerous small changes in material culture. GILA PHASE, A.D. 1300 TO 1450 The Gladwins recognized two phases of Salado occupation in the homeland area after the Roosevelt phase. They visualized a "Middle Gila Phase", characterized by large pueblos and Gila Polychrome pottery which lasted from after A.D. 1250 to 1400. For the upper Tonto Basin, probably in the vicinity of the Rye Creek ruin, they proposed a later phase, the Tonto phase, which is essentially the same as the Middle Gila phase except for an increase in the percentages of Tonto Polychrome and Jeddito Black-on- yellow. I would concur with Pierson (1962:68) that'a phase should be established on more than an increase in the percentages of selected pottery</page><page sequence="18">258 DOYEL types. It would be more reasonable to recognize that the late Middle Gila phase in the northern sections may possibly be characterized by an increase in these decorated pottery types. Pierson (1962:68) has suggested that the Gladwins' Middle Gila and Tonto phases be redefined. He apparently visualizes a Middle Gila phase dating between A.D. 1250 and 1350, characterized by walled compounds located on the valley floor and by Gila Polychrome pottery. He then introduces a redefinition of the Tonto phase, which dates from between A.D. 1350 and 1400, and is thought to be characterized by a significant increase in Tonto Polychrome pottery and by a change in settlement pattern. It is felt that Pierson's phase modification may be premature as it is based upon little data. It is to my knowledge quite difficult to distinguish a Middle Gila phase from a Tonto phase site using Pierson's criteria. It is probably true that Tonto Polychrome as a type begins somewhat later than Gila Polychrome. This is, as Pierson admits, insufficient data upon which to base a phase distinction. Pierson's discussion implies that a change in settlement pattern occurred between his Middle Gila and Tonto phases, or around A.D. 1350. This change is apparently seen as a change from walled compounds in the valley floor to cliff dwellings and open sites without compound walls located upon ridge or mountain tops. There is presently little evidence to support this conclusion. Not a single systematic survey has been accomplished and reported on from either the Tonto Basin or the Globe-Miami area which encompasses sufficient environmental and cultural diversity to justify Pierson's phase division. On the contrary, data are becoming available which suggest that the entire time period between A.D. 1300 and 1450 was characterized by a diverse settlement pattern. It is therefore suggested that the definition of a Tonto phase for the Salado area has been based upon scanty evidence, while a Gila phase can be confidently documented. This Gila phase could encompass the well known late Salado sites such as Gila Pueblo, Besh-ba-gowa, To-get-zoge, Tonto National Monument, and the Rye Creek Ruin. Placing the late Salado development into a single Gila phase can be typologically defended, as it is Gila Polychrome which remained the dominant pottery type during the late time period. A Gila phase can be easily distinguished from the earlier Roosevelt phase, while at this time a Tonto phase cannot be easily distinguished from the Gila phase. Since we are still operating on limited and insufficient evidence, it is felt that a phase distinction between the Gila and Tonto phases could be considered but is currently based on limited data and should therefore be subject to detailed scrutiny during future research. Gladwin (1957) has attributed the development of the Gila phase to a migration of proto-Hopi people into the Salado area. This is based upon ceramic design styles and architectural evidence. The development of very large pueblos during this phase was, according to Gladwin, due to increased</page><page sequence="19">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 259 harassment by nomadic Athabascan raiders. Although the nomadic raider hypothesis, not necessarily Athabascan, continues to be discussed, it is currently considered to be a weak explanation for the widespread occurrence of aggregation which is documented for a large portion of the Southwest during the early Pueblo III time period. Gladwin was certainly correct in stating that the Gila phase was a time of coming together, and this probably involved an expanding population. Whether this was due to the necessity for more social control, or for cooperation in subsistence pursuits, or for some combination of reasons has yet to be determined, and this applies to a much greater area than just the Salado homeland. Recent research, however, has suggested that the Gila phase, and probably to some extent the Roosevelt phase, is actually characterized by a diverse settlement pattern developed through time by the Salado to more effectively use the wide range of environmental resources available to the people (Doyel 1972:63-84). This includes the location of settlements in various diverse biotic and topographic situations for different purposes, ranging from several different types of agricultural strategies to the collection of a variety of naturally occurring plants and animals. The Miami Wash project was able to define a portion of the Gila phase pattern, and our results demonstrate that large pueblos were not the only settlement type which existed during the Gila phase. The majority of sites we excavated contained Gila phase components, generally characterized by one to two rooms which were non-contiguous and were located on the terrace edge overlooking the floodplain. Our survey data indicates that many more such sites are located along the drainages. Archaeomagnetic dates obtained from the excavated Gila phase components range from A.D. 1350 to 1420 (1350 a 23, DuBois #946; 1420 a 32, DuBois #945). Architecture consisted of wet-laid cobble masonry which was carried up to about 1 m in height. The remainder of the walls were constructed of perishable materials and the roof was usually supported by internal roof support posts, usually of juniper. Artifactual material recovered from these small sites is quite variable, but consists primarily of quantities of ground and chipped stone items and plain and red pottery. Ceramic assemblages consist of small jars and bowls while little evidence of storage vessels is present. Cooking, serving, and limited storage appear to be the main functions of these ceramic assemblages. Decorated pottery usually represents less than three percent of any assemblage, composed primarily of Gila Polychrome, but some sherds of Tonto Polychrome, Gila Black-on-red, San Carlos Red-on-brown, Cibola White Ware, and Four-mile Polychrome were also recovered. It appears that the sites may have been oriented towards the gathering and processing of both domesticated and native flora. Native plants recovered from Gila phase components include: thistle (Cirsium sp.), deer-vetch (Lotus sp.), yucca (Yucca sp.), agave or mescal (Agave sp.), hopbush (Dodonaea</page><page sequence="20">260 DOYEL viscosa), heron-bill (Erodium texanum), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), bristle grass (Setaria sp.), juniper (Juniperis monosperma), hackberry (Celtis reticu- lata), and white fir (Abies cf. concolor). Corn pollen was also recovered from room floors and from metate surfaces. The presence of projectile points, chipped stone tools, and animal bone adds another dimension to the range of subsistence activities carried on at these small sites. Furthermore, the presence of tools such as bone awls, antler flakers, cores, and arrow shaft straighteners suggests that considerable maintenance activity occurred as well. We know that during the Gila phase, there were many large Salado pueblos located in the area in various places, both along and some distance from the primary drainages. A series of these large sites are located on the hills above the sites we excavated. In close proximity then we have large, permanently occupied sites and small, possibly seasonally occupied sites. Undoubtedly, these large and small sites were related somehow, thus presenting some insight into the settlement system which had developed by the Gila phase. Future research will, no doubt, further illuminate the nature of this complex settlement system. The Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin areas were abandoned by A.D. 1450. This conforms to the pattern of many other areas in the Southwest at this time, including the White Mountain area to the east and the Verde River valley to the west. In other areas, some aboriginal groups survived into the historic period. Reed (1955:189) has suggested that the remnants of the Salado may have migrated to Zufii after the abandonment of other areas. Actually, what became of the Salado has been a subject of debate for decades, and will continue to be until archaeologists accomplish more systematic work in a number of areas in the Southwest. APACHE OCCUPATION A small quantity of Apache pottery was recovered from several of the sites we excavated, the majority of it coming from Arizona V:9:57. This material was not associated with any features, nor was it associated with the prehistoric components, indicating some limited use of the area at a late time. Approximately five vessels are represented in the small sherd collection. Grenville Goodwin (1969:25-28) has documented the Apache occupa- tion of the immediate area at a site known as Wheatfields, located to the north of the junction of Pinal Creek and Miami Wash. According to Goodwin, the Pinal band of the San Carlos Apache utilized the floodplain for farming, with fields spread over a distance of six miles along Pinal Creek. The Apache abandoned the area in 1864 due to an Anglo attack. The Pinal band then joined the Arivaipa band and never again occupied the Pinal area until after the reservation period had begun.</page><page sequence="21">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 261 Since Arizona V:9:57 is located near the site of Wheatfields, it is probable that the Apache pottery found on this site is associated with the Wheatfield occupation. Since the vessels are all jar forms, it is likely that the pots were broken during collecting activities in the area. Little is known about the early Apache occupation of the area. Gladwin (1957) feels that the Apache were in the area during prehistoric times and were a principle cause of Salado abandonment of the area. The recent feeling is that the Apache were probably not in the area before A.D. 1500. The Apache pottery found during our excavations can then be roughly dated to between A.D. 1500 and 1864. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Recent highway salvage operations related to the realignment of State Route 88 near Globe-Miami Arizona resulted in the excavation of eight prehistoric sites. The material recovered reflects Hohokam, Salado, and Apache occupation of the area. These excavations have contributed substan- tially to our understanding of the chronology and culture history of this poorly reported portion of Arizona. This recent work in conjunction with past research provides the basis for the accompanying comparative phase chart (Figure 10). This chart is included to graphically outline and to update the Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin chronological sequence in relation to surrounding regions. It appears evident that the Globe-Miami area witnessed Hohokam utilization beginning by the Gila Butte phase of the Colonial period and extending through the Sacaton phase of the Sedentary period. The majority of the decorated pottery associated with these Hohokam components reflects strong ties to the Hohokam core area in the Gila-Salt area. The presence of Snowflake Black-on-white as a consistently associated intrusive type with Sacaton phase material suggests that the local Hohokam were in contact with Western Pueblo people during the late Pueblo II time period. It has been demonstrated that the Tonto Basin was also occupied by the Colonial period Hohokam. No evidence of a Sacaton phase occupation of this region has yet been demonstrated but such evidence will most likely be found in the future. A new phase, the Miami phase, has been introduced which furthers our understanding of a heretofore poorly understood time period. The origin and development of this new phase are not well understood, but will ultimately serve to broaden our understanding of the early Salado development in the Globe-Miami area, and possibly the Tonto Basin as well. It is during this time period that Western Pueblo-like developments occur in a number of localities in the transition zone in central Arizona, the Bylas phase (Johnson and Wasley 1966) as one nearby example.</page><page sequence="22">262 DOYEL COMPARATIVE PHASE CHART VERDE GILA GLOBE TONTO POINT RIVER BASIN MIAMI BASIN OF PINES Point of Pines 1400 Canyon Creek Canyon Creek Tuzigoot Civano Gila Gila Pueblo Viejo 1300 Pinedale Pinedale Roosevelt Roosevelt 1200 Soho Miami Bylas Tularosa, Honanki Linden 1100 Carrizo Reserve 1000 Dry Valley Camp Verde Sacaton Socaton Sacaton Sacaton Nantack 900 Corduroy Cloverleaf 800 Hackberry Santa Cruz Santa Cruz Santa Cruz Santa Cruz Mogollon 3 Forestdale 700 600 Gila Butte Gila Butte Gila Butte 500 Breternitz Gladwin Gladwin Gladwin Johnson and Breternitz Haury and 1960 and others and Gladwin 1957 Wasley 1966 1959 Sayles 1947 1937 1935 Haury Brown Hammock Doyel 1932 1973 1969 n.d. Figure 10. Comparative phase chart for Globe-Miami, Tonto Basin, and adjacent areas.</page><page sequence="23">Revised Phase System, Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin Areas 263 To be somewhat more specific, the cultural connections of the Miami phase appear to be mixed and include both late Hohokam and Western Pueblo characteristics. Hohokam affinities are strongly apparent in the local ceramic assemblage and are allied to the Soho phase of the Hohokam Classic period. Other allied elements include the shell assemblage, projectile point styles, chipped and ground stone assemblages, and other items. Coupled with the above material is the pattern of cobble masonry, enclosing walls, and extended burials, traditionally considered to be Western Pueblo in origin. It is interesting to note here that no locally manufactured decorated pottery is associated with the Miami phase. This is in sharp contrast to the nearby and contemporary Bylas phase wherein a local form of Casa Grande Red-on-buff and San Carlos Red-on-brown were both manufactured. Intrusive ceramics associated with the Miami phase include a predominance of Snowflake Black-on-white, but also include St. Johns Polychrome, McDonald Painted Corrugated, Little Colorado White Ware (probably Walnut Black-on- white), Reserve-Tularosa Black-on-white, and San Carlos Red-on-brown. These intrusives suggest that contacts ranged geographically from the Little Colorado area southeast to the White Mountain district and east to the Bylas-Safford area. It is suspected that contacts were most active with the White Mountain district. No corrugated pottery was locally manufactured during the Miami phase, while a number of Reserve-like corrugated sherds were recovered as intrusives. This indicated another major distinction between the Miami phase and the Bylas phase, wherein the latter phase is partially characterized by locally made textured pottery including indented, plain, pattern, and obliterated corrugated (Johnson and Wasley 1966:241). In the Globe-Miami area texturing of pottery does not appear until the Roosevelt phase, sometime around or shortly after A.D. 1200. Only additional research will clarify the cultural position of the Miami phase portion of the chronology. As of this writing it is not known if a similar transitional phase exists in the Tonto Basin. Archaeological material representative of the Roosevelt and Gila phases of the Salado occupation of Globe-Miami was also recovered during the recent excavations. On the basis of this work and past research it is recommended that the Salado chronology be revised. A Roosevelt phase is the earliest manifestation traditionally referred to as Salado. This phase appears to date within the 13th century. A Gila phase has been documented and may encompass the remainder of the Salado occupation of the area. A Tonto phase has been proposed by other researchers, but it is felt that this late phase is currently based on insufficient evidence. Little is known of the origin, nature, and geographic extent of the Roosevelt phase, but its origins undoubtedly lie in the area between the transition zone encompassing the Globe-Miami and Tonto Basin areas and the</page><page sequence="24">264 DOYEL wooded mountainous country to the northeast. By the Gila phase, the geographic extent of the Salado pattern included the above two areas, east through the Safford valley and into western New Mexico, and possibly the southeastern portion of Arizona.
