Warren, Ml ABSTRACT This paper presents a methodology to link reductions in biomechanical responses due to force-limiting material to projections of injury mitigation in real-world side impact crashes, and to use this approach to evaluate the potential injury reducing benefit for the chest and abdomen of constant crush force material in the side door and armrest. Using a simulation of the human impact response, a range in crush force was determined which effectively reduced a peak biomechanical response from that obtained with a rigid impact. The range in constant crush force depended on the velocity of impact. The higher the velocity of impact, the higher the level of crush force to achieve a reduction in the peak response. NCSS field accident data for car-to-car side impacts provided informa- tion on the occupant exposure and injury as a function of the change in velocity (AV) of the struck vehicle. Based on various experimental studies, the velocity of the side door at contact with the occupant's chest is similar to the AV of the struck vehicle (about 60Ä of the closing speed of the striking vehicle) . The chest impact velocity in the simulation was assumed equal to the observed AV in the NCSS data. This related the simulation data to real-world injury data. Reductions in biomechanical response were related to lower injury risk. This enabled a calculation of a reduction in injured occupants assuming an equivalent reduction in real-world injury risk for the velocity range in which the EA mate- rial was effective. The greatest reductions in seriously injured occupants were found with a relatively soft constant crush force EA material which is effective in low-speed (AV =» 4-8 m/s) crashes, whereas padding of this type was negligibly effective in high-speed crashes (AV &gt; 10 m/s) . THERE HAVE BEEN many judgments and opinions put forth on the injury reducing benefits of force-limiting and energy-absorbing material for occupant protection in side impacts. The objective of this study was to develop a meth- odology to link reductions in biomechanical responses due to force-limiting material to projections of injury mitigation in real-world side impact crashes, and to use this approach to evaluate the potential injury reducing benefits for the chest and abdomen of a 5 or 10 cm thickness of constant crush-force mate- rial in the side door and armrest. METHODOLOGY MODIFIED LUMPED MASS MODEL FOR THE CHEST - In 1073 Lobdell (1) published a lumped-mass model of the anteroposterior thoracic impact response of the human thorax. He developed a mechanical analog of the human chest composed of two masses and connecting springs and dash- pots; and, he matched the model's force- deflection response to blunt impact data from human cadaver tests. The mechanical elements in the simulation (Figure 1) were adjusted until the model response fell within the low velocity and high velocity force-thoracic deflection corridors recommended by Kroell (2) as representative of the human biomechanical response. The mechanical elements in the lumped-mass model relate to physical characteristics of the human chest. The sternal mass (m«) includes a portion of the skeletal structure and thoracic content and is light. It con- trols the magnitude of the applied load for relatively low thoracic deflections, during the early phase of the biomechanical response of the chest. The heavier spinal mass (ma) also includes a portion of the thorax and pàrt of the total body mass that is coupled through the thoracic spine during impact. Skin and other compliant tissues over the sternum are elastically connected to the sternal mass by a spring (k-j), which interfaces with the impac- ting mass '®ļ) or crushable interface in front of the impacting mass in the modified model. 3.1433 0098-738X/88/9803-1 433802.50 Copyright 1988 8oclety of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">The effective viscous and elastic impact behavior of the chest is modeled by parallel Voigt (k9Q . , c9~) and Maxwell (kve9~, cve9~) material models.

Lobdell's original lumped-mass model was modified by Viano (3) in 1978 to include the computation of kinetic energies, power, and momentum of the masses, and energy stored in springs and dissipated in dashpots during deformation of the chest. More recent modifi- cations of the modified Lobdell model include the feature of scaling size of the thorax from the 95th percentile male through the 5th per- centile female to the six year old child. In this application, Lobdell 's original model was further modified to include a thickness of force-limiting and energy-absorbing material between the rigid impactor and the lumped-mass thoracic model. The mechanical response of the thoracic model possesses four degrees of freedom, but the original equations of motion were modified. Two types of compressible interface were modelled in this study, a constant crush force EA material and a constant stiffness (force linearly increases with interface crush) mate- rial.

The impact response of the model is computed by Hamming's modified predictor-corrector method, which incorporates a fourth-order procedure with time-steps varied to satisfy a predeter- mined solution accuracy. The response is sequentially calculated until a tensile force is developed in the sternal tissue spring (k- 2) . In an actual impact, a tensile force in this spring is not possible and thus is representative of separation of the impacting mass (EA interface) from the thorax. The programming features introduced in the 1978 modified version of the model have been fur- ther updated to include the effects of the energy absorbing interface on the cumulative and incremental energy storage and dissipated, instantaneous power associated with energy storage and dissipation, and mass energies and momenta. The kinetic energies (KE.), powers (PM.) and momenta (MM.) associated with system mas- ses (i = 1,2, 3 J have an instantaneous magni- tude given by: KE.(t) = 1/2 m.y.(t)2 (15) PM.(t) = Im.y.OOý.OOl (16) MM.(t) = m.ý.(t) (17) Energy transfer during the mechanical response can be stored by spring compression for subsequent release into the system and can be dissipated by damping elements and the EA interface. Energy associated with spring elements (EST.) depends on the instantaneous relative position (i.e., stretch or compres- sion) between endpoints of the spring. An example calculation for energy storage by the thoracic stiffness element (kooO *s ßiven as a demonstration : 1 EST23.(t) = 1/2 k23. [y2(t) - y3(t)]2 (18) The power (PS.) or rate of energy change associated with energy storage or release from elastic spring elements depends on the force developed across the spring element and the relative velocity between the endpoints. An example of power developed in energy storage in the thoracic stiffness element O^g^) *s: psi(t) = ik23i [ý2(t) - ý3(t)] [y2(ť) - *3 00] I (19) Energy is dissipated (i.e., physically lost in heat) in damping elements due to for- ces across the dashpot and the relative motion between its endpoints. Since energy dissipa- tion (EDS.) is an integrated effect over the entire moèion of the system, the statement of work can be written, 872212 y(t) EDS. (t) = J F dy = (20) i ♦ t to / (F dy/dt) dt = J cý dt For the purpose of numerical approximation of the incremental energy dissipation (ED^) , Equation (16) can be expressed in the form of an example for the major thoracic damping element (c23) as: ED2g(t) = 1/2 c23 {[y (t - At) - y3(t - At)] + (21) - *3(t)]2 &gt;At which leads to a simple summation for the cumulative dissipation of energy: t EDS23(t) = E ED23(t) (22) Energy dissipated by crush (EDc(t)) of the EA material is given by the product of the crush force (F ) which depends on the level of EA interface crush from Equation (1) at that time-step and the incremental crush (Acc) summed to the current time: t EDS (t) ' = E ED (t) (23) cN ' » cx where, EDc(t) = FcAcc (24) Acc(t) = cc(t) - cc(t - At) (25) Instantaneous powers (PD.) associated with energy dissipation by damping elements depend on the velocity across the element.

Using the standard calibration procedure for the blunt frontal impact response of the Hybrid III dummy chest, a 23.4 kg impacting mass was swung into contact with the chest at an impact velocity of 6.7 m/s. In these tests, a crush- able interface of Hexcell was used in front of the rigid impactor. The crush force of the Hexcell was 1.78, 2.34, 2.67, 2.89, 3.45, and 4.45 kN and the crush thickness of the mate- rial was 5 cm. As in the standard calibration procedure, a 15.24 cm (6 in.) diameter impact interface was used. 3.1435</page><page sequence="4">The dummy was instrumented with the fol- lowing transducers to measure responses typi- cal of those simulated by the analytical model. A uniaxial accelerometer was attached to the sternum and a triaxial accelerometer to the thoracic spine of the dummy. The standard chest deflection measurement was recorded during impact and was used to compute the viscous response (4) . In addition, an accel- erometer was attached to the impacting mass to compute impact force. The final crush of the interface material was measured to determine the energy absorbed by the interface. A total of ten tests were conducted with an energy- absorbing interface of 5 cm thickness. A series of tests was attempted with a 10 cm thickness but due to an instability in the crush characteristics of the Hexcell and buck- ling of the material during crush, the data from those tests is not included in this report . PARAMETER STUDY CONDUCTED - A wide range of impact parameters and crushable materials were simulated using the modified lumped-mass model of the human thorax to determine the influence of crushable material on the bio- mechanical responses of the thorax. In order to increase the severity of the impact while maintaining control over the parameters selec- ted, an impact mass of 20 kg was fixed for the parameter study and the velocity of impact was increased so that there was a doubling of kinetic energy between each velocity of impact selected for the study. The 20kg impactor mass was selected as representative of the impact to a near-side occupant in a side crash. It produces an energy transfer and impact duration that strikes a balance between a lighter impactor which slows too quickly on chest contact and a heavier impactor that remains in contact with the chest too long and produces too great of a momentum transfer and final velocity of the occupant. Using a 20kg impactor, the velocity of the chest at separ- ation is about 60% of the initial impactor velocity. Implications of this assumption are discussed in the companion paper. The lowest velocity of impact was 5 m/s and a doubling of energy was achieved by the second impact severity of 7 m/s. These impacts are representative of the low and high velocity impact condition used to define the biomechanical response corridors for the human cadaver chest (2,3). Two higher severity impacts were selected to broaden the range of impact exposure and assess the effects of energy-absorbing interfaces on biomechanical responses . The high severity impacts were at 10 m/s and 12.2 m/s. In this paper only the constant crush force interface was investi- gated. The constant crush force of the energy-absorbing interface was incremented by 0.5 kN and varied from a low of 1.0 kN to a high of 8.0 kN, which covered the range of very soft and very stiff interfaces. Two thicknesses of the energy-absorbing interface were simulated, a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness. Each simulation produces a set of biomech- anical responses and includes such responses as contact force, chest deflection (compres- sion), viscous response, sternal and spinal acceleration, crush of the energy-absorbing material, and energies and powers of chest deformation. The most sensitive measure of injury potential for the thorax is the viscous response (4) , which is the instantaneous prod- uct of the velocity of deformation and com- pression of the thorax during impact. A second measure of potential injury is the maximum chest compression. RANGE OF BENEFITS FROM AN EA INTERFACE - Crush forces producing a reduction of either 10% or 20% in the peak viscous response from that obtained in the rigid impact were deter- mined for a particular severity of impact. This approach defined a range of crushable interfaces which reduced the biomechanical response. A 10% or 20% window of benefit was defined for each velocity of impact, repre- senting an increasing severity of blunt loading. In addition to the benefits window, a range in crush force was determined where the peak viscous response was reduced by an energy-absorbing interface below a currently accepted tolerance level for serious injury risk. The crushable interfaces that reduced the viscous response below VC = 1.0 m/s (4) were determined and superimposed on the win- dows (or corridors) of 10% and 20% benefit for both the 5 cm and 10 cm thickness of energy- absorbing interface material. REAL-WORLD SIDE IMPACT INJURIES - Using the NCSS field accident data for car-to-car side impacts analyzed by Rouhana and Foster (5), occupant exposures and injury risks were determined as a function of the computed change in velocity (AV) of the struck vehicle. The injury risk function (the probability of injury as a function of the change in velocity of the struck vehicle) was computed from the available information on the number of occu- pants exposed and the number injured of sever- ity AIS 3+ for each 1.35 m/s (3 mph) increment of AV. This resulted in 15 increments in AV for the field accident data covering the full range of crashes observed in real-world side impacts. In addition to the injury risk func- tion it was possible to plot the occupant exposure and occupant injury functions for the range of accident severities. These functions define the range of AV which has the greatest exposure of occupants and the AV range which results in the greatest number of seriously injured occupants. The number of injured occupants was verified by multiplying the injury risk and occupant exposure for each increment of crash severity and comparing with the actual numbers from the NCSS data. BIOMECHANICAL MODELING LINKED TO REAL- WORLD ACCIDENTS - It was possible to link the range of reduced thoracic responses obtained with energy-absorbing material to the real- world field accident injury data by relating the AV of the struck vehicle in the NCSS data 3.1436</page><page sequence="5">to the velocity of impact in the simulation. The French recently published data (6) on car- to-car side impacts, where the deformation characteristics of the struck vehicle were measured. These 14 m/s (30 mph) side impacts demonstrated (Table 1) that the AV of the struck vehicle closely approximates the maxi- mum (intrusion) velocity of the side door at contact with the occupant. This data provides the link between the simulation and real-world accidents, and allows a one-to-one correspon- dence between impact velocity in the simula- tion and AY from field accident data. A number of other experimental studies have been conducted simulating car-to-car side-impacts in which the deformation (veloc- ity) of the intruding side-door has been mea- sured. Table 1 summarizes the recent French study and shows the maximum intrusion velocity of the striking vehicle. Other experimental studies (7,8) have found maximum intrusion velocities in the range of 80-100% of the velocity of the striking vehicle. Since impact velocity is such an important parameter in this study, both in setting the violence of the impact and in linking the simulation and field accident data, the contact velocity and time history of the door on the chest should be considered a high-priority measurement in laboratory tests. Hardy and Suthurst (7) reported a chest impact velocity of 8.0 m/s in 14 m/s car-to-car side impacts. In these tests the maximum intrusion velocity of the side-door was 12.5 m/s. The maximum door velocity happened very early in the crash and the door velocity was lower at occupant con- tact. PROJECTION OF BENEFITS FROM EA PADDING - The injury reducing benefits from a force- limiting and energy-absorbing interface in side impacts were assessed by selecting a crush force for the EA material and identi- fying the range of velocities where the vis- cous (or compression) response was reduced by 10% or 20% from the value obtain with the rigid impact. The probability of injury decreases with reductions in the viscous response (4) . In the mid-region of the injury probability function, the viscous response is linearly related to injury risk and has a Table 1 CAR-CAR SIDE IMPACTS (From (6)) Impact Speed 13. 02 * .28 m/s Delta V (Struck Vehicle) 8.28 * .02 m/s Delta V (B-Pillar) 8.03 * .04 m/s Maximum Door Velocity 8.58 * 1.40 m/s 872212 slope of approximately 1.5 unit decrease in viscous response producing a 1.0 unit decrease in injury risk. For the EA materials that produced a 10-20% reduction in viscous response, an average 15% reduction in viscous response was assumed and would lead to an average 10% reduction in injury risk. In the velocity range producing greater than a 20% reduction in viscous response, an average 30% reduction in viscous response was assumed and would result in an averaged 20% reduction in injury risk. A reduction in injured occupants was com- puted by lowering the value of injury risk from the NCSS data in the range of velocities where the EA material provides benefit. By reducing the injury risk by 10% or 20% in the effective range of the padding, the lower value of injury risk was multiplied by the actual number of exposed occupants to compute a new reduced number of injured occupants. The difference between the actual number injured and the reduced injured represents a difference or savings in injured people for a particular 1.35 m/s increment of AV. The reduced number of injured occupants for the AV increment was divided by the total number of injured in the original NCSS data set to obtain a fraction of injury reduction for the velocity increment. Summing the injury redu- cing fractions over the effective velocity range of the energy-absorbing material gave a projection for the overall benefit (reduction in AIS 3+ injuries) for a particular thickness and crush force of an interface material. This exercise was conducted for two types of energy-absorbing material. The first mate- rial selected had a 6.5 kN (50 psi) crush force which is representative of the candidate materials recently tested as side-door padding in side-impacted vehicles. This crush force is typical of some high-density closed-cell foams (53 psi) and ensolites (48-65 psi) . The second material selected had a crushed force of 3.5 kN (28 psi) and produced reductions in the viscous response more closely related to the velocity range where the greatest number of occupant injuries occur and where a greater possible benefits may be realized. RESULTS BIOMECHANICAL RESPONSES OBTAINED WITH A MODIFIED LOBDELL MODEL - Figures 2 and 3 are examples of the biomechanical responses obtained with the modified Lobdell model and a rigid or constant crush force interface. The energy-absorbing interface crushes and limits force during a portion of the impact. In the example with EA padding, the full thickness of the energy-absorbing interface is crushed and there remains sufficient energy in the impact to increase the impact force after crush. With a crushable interface, there are essen- tially two impacts occurring during the simu- lation. The first is associated with the initial contact of the energy-absorbing inter- 3.1437</page><page sequence="6">face with the chest and the response of the chest during crush of the energy- absorbing material. A second impact may occur when the full crush of the energy-absorbing interface occurs and there is sufficient energy to cause increases in the biomechanical responses of the chest. This second impact after full crush of the material can produce the greatest biomechanical responses in some cases and in others the maximum severity occurs during the first impact. In this example, a 3.5 kN crush force interface was selected with a 5 cm thickness. The impact severity is 10 m/s. Figure 3 shows that force develops rapidly after contact with the chest and within several milliseconds is limited by crush of the energy-absorbing interface. Full crush of the interface occurs at 15 ms. After crush of the material, force on the chest increases and causes more chest deflection. Peak force occurs at 21 ms and is at a level of 5.8 kN. It results in a maximum chest deflection of 8.6 cm at 28 ms. The viscous response of the chest is sensitive to the events occurring during impact. The viscous response (VC) rises to a peak during crush of the energy absorbing material and falls during mid-crush due to a reduction in the velocity of compression of the chest by interface crush. This causes a reduction in the viscous response in spite of increasing compression levels. After full crush of the EA material, the relative velocity of chest compression increases and because of the higher levels of chest compression, the viscous response reaches a maximum value of 1.4 m/s during the second impact. In this case the maximum viscous response occurs during the second impact, but the EA interface limits the viscous response during crush. By selecting a different crush force or different thickness of material, it is possible to shift the peak viscous response to the crushing phase (first impact) or to the post-crush phase (second impact) .

Energy dissipated by chest defor- mation (DIS-th) and by crush of the interface (DIS-cr) are shown with crush of the EA interface. The acceleration of the sternum and spine demonstrate more of the dynamics of the chest response with an EA interface. In this exam- ple, the maximum sternal acceleration occurs during the initial contact with the EA mate- rial, just about the time that crush is initi- ated. During crush of the material, the ster- nal acceleration is controlled by the force- limiting interface until the material has bottomed and a second impact causes another spike in the sternal acceleration. In this case, the second spike is a broad duration but slightly lower magnitude pulse than occurred from the first peak. The spinal acceleration response is removed from the sternal dynamics and demonstrates a much smoother response. During crush of the EA interface, the peak spinal acceleration plateaus at about 13 g's; however, during the second impact after the crush of the interface, the spinal acceler- ation increases with the increasing contact force and reaches a peak acceleration of 22 g's at 21 ms. Energy absorbed and dissipated are also shown along with the other forms of energy associated with the impact response of the chest. The viscous responses shown in Figure 4 for the 10 m/s impact severity and 5 cm thick- ness are for a range of constant crush-force EA interfaces. This superposition of viscous responses demonstrates the shift in peak value from the first to second impact as the crush force of the material is reduced. The optimum viscous response was obtained with a crush force that just completely uses the available crush space, and where the first and second peak are equal. In this case, the minimum value in viscous response is obtained with a crush force of 4 kN. 3.1439</page><page sequence="8">2 j- - Legend / 1 kW - /'A ' / Y A ' - L™__.

The superposition of viscous responses in Figure 4 demonstrates an additional feature occurring with an energy-absorbing interface. For very stiff materials, those above 6 kN, the interface is so stiff that it acts as a rigid interface. That is, there is no crush of the energy-absorbing interface occurring during impact because the contact force is below the crush force of 6 kN. However, as the EA interface is reduced in crush force, there is a reduction in viscous response from crush and energy absorption by the interface. At the minimum value of 4 kN, the full crush of the interface occurs. If the crush force is further reduced in value, less energy is absorbed by crush of the interface and thus the greater remaining energy in the impactor causes an increase in the viscous response. In this case, the increase in viscous response is later in the impact and is associated with the after crush response. As the crush force is further reduced, the peak viscous response increases until it reaches the level obtained with a rigid impact. For a 5 cm thickness of very soft crushable material, virtually no energy is absorbed by crush, and the impact closely approximates a rigid impact. For this example, a crush force below 1 kN produces essentially a rigid impact viscous responses. Figure 5 summarizes the peak viscous response obtained in the 10 m/s impact simula- tions with crushable interfaces. This plot summarizes the first and second peak values shown in the responses in Figure 4 and demon- strates the rigid impact response for crush- able interfaces greater than 6 kN crush force and the reduction in viscous response with softer material. The minimum in viscous response with 5 cm thickness of EA material occurs at 4 kN and results in a 40% reduction in peak viscous response. The curve to the left that crosses and is marked as a 5 cm thickness represents the effects of second impact after crush with lower crush force materials. It shows an increase in viscous response with a softening interface due to the increasing severity of the second impact. With a 10 cm thickness of EA material, there was a broader range of crush force which reduces the viscous response. The increase in range of crush force occurs at the lower crush force levels because the larger thickness of crushable material allows lower crush forces to reduce the viscous response before the second impact approaches the rigid response after bottoming of the energy-absorbing material. In this case the minimum viscous response is obtained with a 3.2 kN crushable interface and results in a 60% reduction in the peak viscous response. ** t T 1.2 - ' ' c 5 /l' cm w / ' c 5 cm w ^ "" 10 Cm ' A - J ' **T^m/s, 20 kg .2 - I I I I I I I I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Crush Force (kN) 50 5 cm ?» 5 10 m/s r- 10 - I I 1 I I I I I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Crush Forot (kN) Figure 5: Peak viscous responses and maximum chest compression with 5 cm and 10 cm of crushable interface showing the magnitude of the first peak during crush and second peak after crush in the viscous response at 10 m/s. 3.1440</page><page sequence="9">A similar profile in reduction of chest compression (Figure 5) was found for the energy-absorbing interface. However, the chest compression response is not as robust as the viscous response and is less sensitive to the effects of the first and second impact. The insensitivity is, in part, due to the fact that chest compression is essentially the sum or overall effect of the entire impact loading. With a 5 cm thickness of EA mate- rial, there is a maximum 14% reduction in chest compression, with the 10 cm thickness of material there is a 31% reduction in compres- sion. Figure 6 shows the maximum crush of the energy-absorbing interface as a function of the crush force for the 10 m/s impact. For crushable interfaces of &gt;6.4 kN, no crush of the material occurs and the qjiest response is essentially as if it were impacted with the rigid interface. For softer crushable mate- rials, there is an increase in crush of the material to its maximum of 5 or 10 cm depen- ding on the thickness of the interface simula- ted. These curves demonstrate that the mini- mum in viscous response occurs just as the interface fully crushes and is at 4 kN with the 5 cm material and 3.2 kN with 10 cm mate- rial. If the crush response is overlayed with the biomechanical viscous response for the .ange of EA interfaces (Figure 6 overlayed on Figure 5) , it is possible to see that the increase in viscous response associated with second impact occurs gradually as less and less energy is absorbed by a fully crushed interface. However, there is a relatively broad range of EA materials that effectively reduce the viscous response even though the material has fully crushed during impact. The maximum reduction in viscous response with 5 cm thickness occurs with the 4 kN crush-force interface, where 200 J (4.0 kN x 5 cm) of the initial 1,000 J (20 kg at 10 m/s) is dissipated by the interface. Here, 20% of the kinetic energy of the impact is dissipated 10 - O ^ 8 - 10 cm ' E ' ' o ' c ' S Q ' O ' 10 m/s, 20 kg * - 5 cm ' 2 ' I I I I I I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Crush Force (kN) Figure 6: Maximum crush of the interfaces associated with the responses in Figure 5. 872212 by crush of the EA material and produces a 40% reduction in viscous response from the rigid impact response. Using the 10 cm thickness of EA material, the optimum crush force of 3.2 kN absorbs 320 J or 32 percent of the initial impact kinetic energy, and results in a 60% reduction in peak viscous response from that occurring with a rigid interface. The range of crush forces for the EA interface where reductions in viscous response are derived after full crush is quite large. In this case, greater than 10% reduc- tion in viscous response occurs for crushable materials with a yield force of 2.8-4.0 kN even though the material has fully crushed for the lower force-limiting materials. The range of effectiveness with 10 cm thickness of EA material is 1.8-3.2 kN. If we were to identify the range in crush- able interfaces where the peak viscous re- sponse is reduced below a tolerance level of [YQ] = 1.0 m/s (4), a 5 cm thickness of ior cedimi ting material of any choice cannot reduce the viscous response below the toler- ance level (see Figure 5). In contrast, with a 10 cm thickness of crushable interface, a crush force of 2.9-3.8 kN will achieve a reduction in peak viscous response below tolerance . Figure 7 and 8 show the biomechanical responses for a 7 m/s impact severity which has 50% lower kinetic energy than in the 10 m/s impact example. The viscous and chest compression response demonstrate a shift in the effective range of force-limiting to a softer material. In this case, the minimum viscous response with a 5 cm thickness of material occurs at 2.4 kN and is further reduced to 2.0 kN with 10 cm thickness of material. Here however, there is a greater reduction in viscous response from the rigid response achieved with the energy-absorbing interface. In this case there is a 54% reduc- tion in peak viscous response with 5 cm thickness of material and nearly a 75% reduction with 10 cm thickness. In contrast to these larger reductions in viscous response over that obtained in the 10 m/s impact, there is a proportionately smaller reduction in chest compression. In this case, the maximum reduction in chest compression with 5 cm interface thickness is 13% and a 27% reduction with 10 cm thickness of material. Peak viscous responses are plotted for the range of crush forces evaluated in this study with a 5 cm thickness of EA material. The responses for the four severities of impact are shown in Figure 9 and 10 and demonstrate that the maximum realizable reductions in viscous response are achieved at the lowest levels of impact severity. For the cases simulated here, a maximum of 70% was found for the 5 m/s impact at a crush force of 1.7 kN. In contrast, the maximum realizable reduction in viscous response for the 12.2 m/s impact was 30% at a crush force of 5.2 kN. Another observation from Figure 9 is that the portions 3.1441</page><page sequence="10">1.2 1.0 - y e e e » § 6 /' A / 8 6 ~ 10 cm ^ 5 cm / i ' /L 7 m/s 20 k9 I » I I I I I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Crush Force (kN) 40 ^ y 5 cm #30 1 20 - / 2 10 m/s E 5 io - i i i i i i i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Crush Force (kN) Figure 7: Peak viscous response and maximum chest compression for a 7.0 m/s impact. 10 i t - k 8 - 10 cm ' eT ' Ä6 - ' £ ' « » » » « 7 m/Si 20 kg Õ4 - / ' 5 cm ' 2 - ' I I I J I I I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Crush Force (kN) of the curves showing a reduction in viscous response with a crushable EA material at the various severities of impact follow a line of increasing crush force with increasing severity. The asymptotic line is defined by the equation VC = .46 (F - 1.38), where crush force is in kN and the viscous response is in m/s. This figure does not include the after- crush benefit curves which reduce the viscous response with various thicknesses of energy- absorbing material. In Figure 10, the effects of 5 cm thick- ness of material are added to the responses for the four severities of impact exposure shown in Figure 9. Adding the second impact effects of energy-absorbing interface to the family of curves demonstrates an additional feature of an EA interface. The range of effective energy-absorbing padding is narrower for low-velocity impacts (for example a 10 % reduction is achieved in the range of crush force of 1.0-2.4 kN, which has a spread of 1.4 kN) than for the higher speed impacts (the range of effective EA interface is 3.8-6.4 kN with a spread of 2.6 kN for the 12.2 m/s impact) .

In contrast, impact severities &gt;10 m/s indicate that there is no choice for energy-absorbing interface that can reduce the peak viscous response below tolerance. It is possible to use the responses plot- ted in Figure 10 to define ranges of crush force which achieve either a 10% or 20% reduc- tion in peak viscous response for the 5 cm thickness of crushable interface. This type of analysis provides a range of crush force for which the peak viscous response is below the maximum value obtained with the rigid interface by &gt;10% or &gt;20% and allows a replot- ting of the data where the severity of impact is the controlling parameter (Figure 11) . Figure 11 provides a summary of the crush- force corridors which reduce the peak viscous response as a function of the severity of impact. For a given velocity of impact or severity, the upper limit is defined as the maximum crush force achieving either a 10% or 20% reduction of peak viscous response. Selecting a crush force that is greater gives a material that is too rigid to produce at least a 10% reduction in viscous response. The lower limit at each severity of impact is controlled by the thickness of the crushable material and minimum crush force to achieve a 2.6 - 24 o„ V"" -v X ~ 24 o„ - 12.2 m/s ' / 12.2 m/s ' / ' / 2.2 - ' / ' / ' / 2.0 - ' / ' / ' / 1.8 - y 10 m/s X X . s / 10 m/s . 1.6 - ' / f 1.6 - ' ' / / 3 14 * ' / I ' &gt; 1.2 - V 2C « £L 10 X ' 7 m/s ' / 7 8 " 7 m/s ' ^ / / ' ' / 6 - ' T,' m/s / y 4 _5 m/s / 5 m/s ° - V 1 I I » » » I I I 12345 6789 10 Crush Force (kN) Figure 10: Addition of the second impact peak to the data in Figure 9 for a 5 cm thick interface. 872212 10% reduction in viscous response. Selection of a softer material can provide effective reductions in peak viscous response only if it is thicker such as is demonstrated by the lower crush force corridor for the 10 cm thickness material. Another way to use Figure 11 is to deter- mine the range of impact severities where a particular crushable material provides at least a 10% reduction in viscous response. For example, a 3.5 kN crush force material reduces the peak viscous response from that obtained in a rigid impact by &gt;10% for impacts of severity &gt;6.8 m/s but less than 11.3 m/s. This indicates an effective range for the energy-absorbing interface of 4.5 m/s (10.1 mph) if 5 cm thickness of material is avail- able. A greater severity of impact can be withstood with reductions in viscous response if there is a thicker EA interface. This is demonstrated by the increase in acceptable exposure to &gt;15.3 m/s if 10 cm thickness of material of 3.5 kN crush force is used. Returning to the 5 cm thickness crushable material with the 3.5 kN crush force, for impacts lower in severity than 6.8 m/s, the energy-absorbing material is too stiff to crush and produce &gt;10% reduction at peak viscous response, and thus it approaches the rigid impact response. In contrast, for impacts of severity &gt;11.3 m/s the interface fully crushes and the viscous response caused by the second impact falls outside of the 10% reduction corridor because the second impact is too severe for this thickness of EA interface to significantly reduce the biomechanical response . Figure 11: Corridors of &gt;10% and &gt;20% reduc- tion in peak viscous response for a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness crushable interface. 3.1443</page><page sequence="12">It is possible to superimpose the range of crushable materials and impact severity that allow the peak viscous response to be reduced below the tolerance level of [VC] = 1.0 m/s. Figure 12 shows the shaded zone for which the viscous response is below tolerance due to an EA interface. This zone for the 5 cm thickness EA material encompasses crush forces from 2.5-4.2 kN and velocities of impact above 7 m/s (recall that the VC response for rigid impact at 7 m/s was just at the threshold of the viscous tolerance so impacts of lower severity will produce below- tolerance viscous responses) . With 5 cm thickness of properly selected EA material, impacts below 9.8 m/s can control the viscous response below tolerance. Impact severities above this velocity have too great an energy to be controlled by a force-limiting interface. A larger zone of tolerance control is obtained with 10 cm thickness of crushable material. The zone is larger to the right for more severe impacts because the greater thick- ness of material can control the viscous response and is larger below because the sof- ter crush force material show benefit. MODEL VALIDATION - The modified Lobdell model was validated by a series of chest impacts to the Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy. In these tests, an energy-absorbing interface was placed behind a light-weight (&lt;.2 kg) wooden interface with a 15.2 cm dia- meter. The results from the Hybrid III dummy tests demonstrate responses and trends identi- cal to those obtained with the model. In particular, the viscous response in the dummy showed the first and second impact responses during and after crush of the EA interface Figure 12: Shade zones on the data of Figure 11 where the crushable interface reduces the peak viscous response below a tolerance level with a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness interface. just as predicted by the analytical simulation. In these tests at 6.7 m/s with a 23.4 kg impacting mass, the rigid impact viscous response approached the tolerance level of 1.0 m/s. Figure 13 shows the reduction in viscous response and chest compression obtained with an energy-absorbing interface in the dummy tests. Superimposed on these curves are the responses obtained from simulations. It is obvious from these curves, that the results obtained for the viscous and compression responses are virtually identical. The average difference between the predicted and experimentally obtained peak viscous response is below 10Ä for the range of crushable interfaces investigated and adds credence to the predictions obtained from the analytical model. FIELD ACCIDENT INJURIES - Table 2 gives the occupant exposure, AIS 3+ injured, and injury risks obtained from the NCSS car-to-car side impact crash data analyzed by Rouhana and Foster (5). The tabulation is done for 1.35 m/s (3 mph) increments in computed AV from the crash data. The first cell at 1.35 m/s indi- cates the range of 2-4 mph AV accidents.

The number of injuries with severity AIS 3+ can be verified by multiplying the injury rate and possible exposures for each crash severity. A drop in injury rate in any velocity cell would result in a reduction of the total number of in- juries. Figure 14 shows the pattern of exposure and AIS3+ injuries as a fraction of the total number of possible injury exposures. The maximum exposure occurs at the lower speeds of impact, between 1.5-6.2 m/s. Because the injury rate increases with the severity of the side impact, the peak in injuries is shifted to a higher crash severity. The peak in injured occupants occurs at 7 m/s. As might be expected, the maximum injury rate occurs for the highest severity crashes and peaks at about 70% risk of AIS 3+ for a 18.9 m/s AY crash, above which no cases occurred. INJURY REDUCING BENEFITS OF FORCE-LIMITING PADDING - Figure 15 shows the relationship between the analysis of the 10% and 20% reduc- tion in viscous response with EA material and field accident injury data from car-to-car side impacts. Remember that the AY of the struck vehicle closely approximates the veloc- ity of the side door at occupant contact and is assumed to equal to the velocity of impact in the blunt impact simulations with the load- limiting materials. The equivalence of impact velocity and AY of the crash provides the link between the analytical simulation and real- world accident injuries. With these curves related, it is possible to project reductions in injury risk for a particular crush-force EA material .

The high crush-force sug- gests that the material can significantly reduce the peak viscous response for impact severities above 13 m/s. For the purpose of projecting a reduction in injury, an average 15% reduction in peak viscous response is assumed for the corridor between the 10% and 20% curves. This average reduction in viscous response is equivalent to a 10% reduction in injury risk. Similarly, between the corridors of the 20% viscous response reduction lines, an averaged 30% reduction in peak viscous response is assumed to result in an average 20% reduction in injury risk. To compute the injury reducing benefits of the energy-absorbing interface, the actually observed injury risk from the field accident data was reduced between the 10% and 20% cor- ridors by 10% and within the 20% corridor by 20%. A reduced number of injured occupants was obtained by multiplying the lowered injury risk and the actual number of exposed occu- pants in each velocity interval where the EA material is effective. This resulted in a lower number of injured occupants which was subtracted from the actual number injured and the difference divided by the overall number of injured occupants to produce a fractional reduction in injured occupants with AIS 3+ trauma. This was done for each of the corri- dors of 10% and 20% benefit for the actual velocity intervals in which injury reduction was projected for a 5 cm thickness of EA mate- rial (see Appendix) . For this particular level of crush łorce and for the 5 cm thick- ness of material, an overall reduction of 3.11% in total injury in side impact crashes is projected. Assuming a 10 cm thickness of material with the 6.25 kN (50 psi) crush force, and recomputing the reduction in injured occupants resulted in an overall 3.93% reduction in total injured. Figure 16 shows a similar exercise using a lower crush-force energy-absorbing material. Figure 15: Velocity range of effectiveness and injury reducing benefits of a load- limiting interface with a crush force of 6.25 kN (50 psi) . Figure 16: Velocity range of effectiveness and injury reducing benefits of a 3.5 kN (28 psi) interface. 3.1446</page><page sequence="15">In this example , the crush force of 3.5 kN (28 psi) is selected to more closely cover the range in which the greatest number of occu- pants are injured in side-impact crashes. It is also a material that more closely aligns with the region in which the peak viscous response can be reduced below its tolerance level. In this example, a 5 cm thickness of energy-absorbing material produces a 6.39% reduction in total injured in side impact crashes and a 10 cm thickness produces a 9.33% reduction in total injured. The range of effectiveness for the lower crush force mate- rial of 5 cm thickness is for impacts above 6.8 m/s but below 11.3 m/s. The range of control in viscous response is much greater with a 10 cm thickness in material and includes velocities of impact from 6.8 m/s to 15.3 m/s. However, even with the greater range of effectiveness with the thicker mate- rial, the maximum projected reduction in injured occupants is &lt;10%. Note that there is a greater reduction in peak viscous response for the lower crush force material which is effective in lower severity crashes. However, the mean reduction of 15% and 30% in the viscous response was not adjusted within the 10-20% and &gt;20% corridors in the analysis. This may underestimate the overall effectiveness of this EÁ interface. Malliaris (9) studied total occupant Harm in automobile crashes and found that 12% of total Harm is related to side interior and arm rest contacts. Since these are the surfaces where EA and force-limiting material could influence injuries in side impact crashes, the maximum Harm reduction with the introduction of padding must be less than 12%. In fact, the overall reduction in total Harm achieved by padding is the product of the projected reductions in injured occupants and the frac- tion of Harm due to side interior and armrest contact (in this case even if the padding were 100% effective, it would result in a 12% reduction in total Harm) . 872212 Table 3 shows the overall reduction in Harm achievable by energy-absorbing padding with a crush force of 6.25 kN (50 psi) or 3.50 kN (28 psi) . With 5 cm thickness of the higher crush-force material, the 3.11% reduc- tion in total injured relates to a 0.37% reduction in total crash injury Harm. À greater reduction in injury occurs with the lower crush force material of 10 cm thickness and results in a projected 1.12% reduction in total Harm in automobile crashes. DISCUSSION The modified Lobdell model of the chest includes a load-limiting interface on the impact mass and was shown to be valid by com- parison with Hybrid III dummy experiments. It is useful for the evaluation of changes in biomechanical response with a range of load- limiting materials and severities of impact. Although this model is for frontal impact, it is one of the few analytical simulations of the chest that has been thoroughly studied in a wide range of applications and has stood the test of time within the biomechanics commun- ity. This model has been used as a represen- tative simulation of the side impact response of the human thorax. Analyses of the forced- deflection response of the human chest by Melvin (10) indicates that although the side impact thoracic response is slightly stiff er, the characteristic response and plateaus are very similar to that of the frontal impact response. In more recent analyses of side impact biofidelity, Viano (11) has shown that the Hybrid III dummy frontal chest réponse is the closest simulation of the lateral human response and that the lateral chest compliance of the human has a lower force plateau and higher compression than in frontal impact. These two analyses indicate that the modified Lobdell model is an appropriate model for side impact simulations until an equivalent lumped- mass model of the lateral thoracic impact Table 3 BENEFITS OF EA PADDING IN SIDE IMPACTS Force Limiting Material Thickness of EA 5cm 10 cm 6.25 kN (50 psi) Fewer Injured - 3.11% - 3.93% Harm Reduction - .37% - .47% 3.50 kN (28 psi) Fewer Injured - 6.39% - 9.33% Harm Reduction - .77% - 1.12% 3.1447</page><page sequence="16">response is available as a substitute. One of the interesting features of this type of analytical simulation is that it is possible to look at a series of questions which are relevant to the side-impact protec- tion efforts currently underway. One question would be whether the effect of stiffness of the anthropomorphic test device used in side- impact testing has an influence on the per- ceived optimum material for s ide- impact pro- tection. This is a pertinent question since the candidate materials for s ide- impact pad- ding, such as some closed-cell foams, have a relatively high crush-force. This leads to injury reducing benefits of the EA interface at the higher severity crashes, where there is the highest risk of injury but the relative rareness of occurrence. This analysis would indicate that the selection of the stiff er foam (possibly driven by a stiff dummy) can lead to a lower effectiveness in s ide- impact protection. By a similar type of analysis where the stiffness parameters in the chest model are increased, the influence of the test device can be evaluated as it might direct the safety community to a particular side-impact padding material . This study also provides the impetus for other investigations of the benefits of energy-absorbing materials in side-impact protection (Table 4). The corridors of reduc- tion in peak viscous response with energy- absorbing material shown in Figure 11 indicate that a rate sensitive material that increases in stiffness with the velocity of deformation would provide a wider range of benefits over a larger velocity range. It is possible to identify the crush force of an EA material as a function of the velocity of impact which achieves the maximum reduction in viscous response. Based on this analysis, a rate- sensitive crush force of Fc = .50(V-2.0) for 5 cm thickness, (for 10 cm thickness, F = .42 (V-2 . 5) ) , where the force is in kN and impact velocity is in m/s, is the most effective over the range of real -world accident exposures. Table 4 INCREASING THE BENEFITS OF EA IN SIDE IMPACT • Rate Sensitive Material F = .50 (Y - 2.0), for 6 cm thickness ss .42 (V - 2.6), for 10 cm thickness • Non-Linear Crush Force • Reduce Velocity of Side-Door • Emphasise High-Exposure Accidents This simulation assumed a constant crush force over the thickness of the material, however, it may be possible to increase the benefits derivable by a non-linear crush char- acteristic of the material. It would be a very interesting exercise to link an optimizer routine with the analytical simulation to determine the most effective crush character- istic of an EA material to achieve benefit over the widest range of crash severities. The analysis also points specifically to the benefit of reducing the velocity of the side door since this is equivalent to reducing the severity of the impact exposure. Although this analysis has not looked at the comparable benefits for reducing side door intrusion velocity versus the use of EA crush material, it would be a natural extension of an overall evaluation of side-impact protection. The relative weighting of these two important factors in side-impact protection is thus far undetermined. It may be possible that greater benefits can be derived from reducing intru- sion velocity. If the chest contact velocity were greater in the NCSS accidents than the AV of the struck vehicle (i.e., greater than 60% of the striking vehicle's velocity), the connection of the NCSS field accident data with the simu- lation results would require a shift in the NCSS data to the right (the AY of the struck vehicle would be lower than the chest impact speed). For example, if the contact velocity were 80% of the velocity of the striking vehi- cle and the AY of the struck vehicle were still 60% (8 m/s) of the striking vehicle's velocity, the occupant contact velocity would be 10.7 m/s and the link would be 10.7 m/s in the simulation to 8 m/s in AY for the real- world accidents. This would slightly increase the projection of Harm reducing benefit for the 3.5 kN and 6.25 kN interface materials since their velocity range of effectiveness would involve a greater percentage of the field accident injury. The analysis also indicates that emphasis should be placed on accidents where the grea- test number of occupants are injured, rather than on the more severe crashes which have very low rates of accident occurrence but high injury rates. This analysis indicates nearly a ten fold increase in injury reducing bene- fits and Harm reduction with a lower crush- force material which is effective in the lower severity crashes but where the highest injury exposure is currently occurring. This sug- gests emphasis on low-severity crashes. The overall objective of this study was to develop a methodology to investigate the effectiveness of load-limiting padding in reducing side-impact injury. This analysis strove to link results from analytical simula- tions of chest impact response to real-world accident injury risks in car-to-car side impact crashes. In the case of the near-side occupant, a side impact crash results in a reasonably predictive intrusion velocity of 3.1448</page><page sequence="17">the side door, so that the results of the blunt impact simulation of the human chest compare reasonably to the impact environment for the near-side occupant. It must be recog- nised, however, that the analytical simulation is based on a 15.2 cm (6 in.) interface of 20 kg mass contacting the chest and that the actual loading of the side thorax is much more complicated in the real -world impacts. The crush force of the material used throughout the analysis can be related to a crush pres- sure for the 15.2 cm diameter area of contact so that the results are presented on the basis of a particular limit pressure on the body. This analysis was conducted to answer a question on the Harm reducing benefit of side- impact padding. The author is aware of studies that have looked at individual pieces of this type of study but has not found a reference where laboratory test data or analy- tical simulations are directly linked to pro- jected injury reductions in real-world crashes. In addition, this study should be judged as a preliminary effort to formulate a methodology for other such evaluations with more refinement in each step of the process. This study does, however, try to provide a scientific basis for the evaluation of occu- pant protection systems, where the range of real-world accident exposures is a principal factor in the strategy for optimum protection. CONCLUSIONS 1. Lobdell's lumped-mass model of the chest was successfully modified to include a force-limiting material interface between the impactor and the chest. Two new parameters were added to the simulation, the crush force of the interface (F ) and the thickness of the crushable material ^C ) . The effect of crush- able material on the Siomechanical response of the chest was simulated for impact velocities of 5.0, 7.0, 10.0 and 12.2 m/s and crushable interfaces with a yield varying in 0.5 kN increments from 1.0-8.0 kN and a thickness of 5 or 10 cm. Experiments with the Hybrid III dummy were conducted to validate the modified Lobdell model. They verified that the predic- ted variations in biomechanical responses are within 10% of those observed in experiments with a crushable Hexcell interface. 2. Based on the results of the simula- tion, a range of crush forces was determined which reduced the peak viscous response (or peak chest compression) by more than either 10% or 20% from that obtained with a rigid impact. The range in crush force depended on the velocity (severity) of impact. The higher the velocity of impact, the higher the level of crush force to achieve a reduction in the peak viscous response. The rate sensitivity is related to the rate-dependent resistance of the human chest which increases in stiffness for higher velocities of impact and thus requires a higher crush-force interface to control the biomechanical response. 872212 3. Viewing the results in another way, a material of a specific crush force produces &gt;10% reduction in peak viscous response from a rigid impact in a relatively narrow range of impact velocities. The velocity range of benefit was about 4.5 m/s (10.1 mph) for a 5 cm thickness EA interface and 8.5 m/s (10.1 mph) for a 10 cm thickness irrespective of crush force. However, the velocity range shifted to higher speeds for a higher crush force interface and is between 8-12 m/s for a 4 kN crush force of 5 cm thickness and 12-16 m/s for a 6 kN interface of similar thickness. For impact velocities above the range of bene- fit, the depth of the interface controlled the high-end cut-off velocity and the peak viscous response was associated with loadings after full crush of the interface. For impact velocities below the low-end cut-off range of benefit, the material was too stiff (the crush force is higher than the load developed by the impact) to crush and significantly reduce the peak viscous response. 4. Field accident data from the NCSS file for car-to-car side impacts provided information on the occupant exposure and injury of severity AIS 3+ as a function of the change in velocity (AV) of the struck vehicle. Based on various experimental studies, the velocity of the side door at contact with the occupant's chest is similar to the AV of the struck vehicle (and is about 60% of the clo- sing speed of the striking vehicle) . The chest impact velocity in the simulation was assumed equal to the observed AV in the NCSS data. This allowed a direct relationship or link between the analytical simulation results and real -world crash injuries. However, bet- ter data on the time history of door motion is needed over a range of impact velocities. 5. If a particular crush force is selec- ted for the energy-absorbing (EA) material, a velocity range where the peak viscous response is reduced by either 10% or 20% can be identified from the simulation and projected on to the real-world accident injury data. By assuming an equivalent reduction in injury risk to the reduction in peak viscous response, a reduction in injured occupants was calculated for the effective velocity range of the EA material. By noting that 12% of the total crash injury Harm is due to occupant contacts with the side interior or arm rest, a projection of benefits was made in Table 3 for two crushable materials. A 6.25 kN crush- force material is typical of candidate side impact energy-absorbing materials for the side interior. It would result in a smaller (3-4%) reduction in injury than would be obtained with a 3.50 kN crush-force material. The lower crush-force material was selected because its effective range of injury reduc- tion matches more closely the maximum injury range in real-world side-impact crashes and resulted in more injury reduction (6-0%). 3.1449</page><page sequence="18">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Many people provided help on this project.
