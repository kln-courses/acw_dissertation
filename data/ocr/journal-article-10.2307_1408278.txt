<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bible Made Me Do It: Christianity, Science, and the Environment Ernest L. Fortin The blame for the environmental disaster that threatens to overtake us unless something is done to avert it is often laid at the door of the Bible and the tradition that comes out of it. Typical of this trend is Lynn White's landmark essay, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis" (1967), which traces the West's ruthless exploitation of nature to the biblical injunction that human beings are to "subdue" the earth and exercise "dominion" over all other living things. Ironically, White's indictment all but coincided with the triumph of an older theory the object of which was to demonstrate against the Enlightenment that, far from being hostile to modem science, the glory of our civilization and the instrument of its conquest of nature, the Christian tradition was the principal agent of its emergence. Christianity would thus be simultaneously and for the same reason responsible for what is best and what is worst in the modem world. The article challenges the premise that these two theories share, namely, that modem science is a child of premodem Christian thought. It begins with a restatement of what was once the commonly accepted view of our relationship to nonhuman nature and ends with a brief account of the essential limitations of modem natural science. The task of assessing the Christian tradition's understanding of our relationship to the natural environment, never an easy one, has not been made easier by the proliferation of ecological studies in our time. For one thing, environmentalism as a special discipline is barely more than thirty years old. Hence the prob- lems on which it focuses were not dealt with thematically or with the same sense of urgency by any of our predecessors, Christian or otherwise. I refer to such highly publicized and politicized issues as air, water, and ground pollution, the depletion the planet's natural resources, the accumulation of toxic waste, the deterioration of the biosphere or the world's great ecosystems through deforestation and urbanization, the extinction of spe- cies, the hole in the sky, acid rain, global warming, and various other threats to our physical well-being about which until re- cently little was known or being said. For another thing, the new discipline began to take shape just as Christian theology was entering a period of seemingly endless fragmentation.</page><page sequence="2">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS The trouble is not that theologians need to be awakened to the gravity of the situation-many of them have been only too eager to jump into the fray-but that they have yet to agree on the appropriate response to it. What we find instead is a wide range of positions that claim to be Christian but mostly reflect the confusion that prevails in the larger academic community. This much is evident from the titles of two well-known books on the subject: Cry of the Environment: Rebuilding the Christian Creation Tradition, edited by P. N. Joranson and K. Butigan,l which sug- gests that the tradition in question has suffered severe damage, for otherwise it would not have to be "rebuilt," and The Travail of Nature: The Ambiguous Ecological Promise of Christian Theology, by P. Santmire,2 which suggests that the notion of nature, the other pivot of the once standard Christian approach to these matters, is likewise in trouble. My aim is not to propose a new solution to the problem-I have none to offer-but to lay out as briefly and as clearly as possible the general principles by which classical Christianity would have been guided had it been confronted with issues of the kind we face today. These principles were derived from two distinct and originally independent sources: the Bible, which supplies us with the notion of creation, and Greek philosophy, to which we are indebted for the notion of nature. It so happens that on the question at hand, these sources, different as they may be in other respects, are more convergent than divergent. The Bible and Creation The key biblical text relating to our subject is Chapter 1 of Genesis, which tells us that heaven and earth and all they contain come from God, who, having completed his work, declared the whole of it to be not only good but "very good" (v. 31). Each part taken separately had already been pronounced good, with two notable exceptions, the sky and the man Adam. What Genesis means by "good" is not spelled out, but the reference appears to be to the fact that each of the elements so described is perfect in the etymological sense of the term, that is to say, complete and fit 1. Santa Fe: Bear &amp; Co., 1984. 2. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985. 198</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE to do its work. To express the same thought in philosophic rather than biblical terms, a thing is good to the extent that it possesses all that belongs to it by reason of its nature. Goodness is whole- ness: bonum ex integra causa, as the Schoolmen used to say. "Good" in that sense adds nothing to the noun that it qualifies. A chair is good if it has what it requires to fulfill its function. To say that it has even the slightest defect is to imply that it is already less than a chair. There is ultimately no difference between a chair and a good chair. If the sky, conceived as a solid vault stretched like a tent over the earth, is not individually called good at the moment of its creation, it is because, with the earth still uncreated, it has not yet demonstrated its capacity to carry out its assigned task, that of separating the waters above the vault, which occasionally come down to us in the form of rain, from the waters here below, such as those found in rivers, lakes, and oceans.3 We further learn that Adam, the only being made in the image and likeness of God, is the peak of creation and the being for whose sake all other material beings exist. Adam is to have dominion over them and be served by them. His superiority to them is corroborated by the fact that he is the one to give to each its name. The habitat prepared for him by God is not a desert but a garden capable of satisfying all his needs without his having to compete with anybody else for his livelihood, engage in violence, or do any hard work. The original plan thus calls for perfect harmony among human beings and between human beings and God. It also calls for perfect harmony between man and irrational animals, a condition highlighted by the vegetarianism of the early humans. Needless to say, the Bible, which frowns on disinterested knowledge and discourages its pursuit-as the deuterocanonical Book of Sirach puts it, "Seek not what is above you or hidden from you" (3:22)-does not offer anything that comes close to a scientific account of nature. Its concerns are strictly religious. In accordance with these concerns, the chapters that follow the creation narrative in Genesis concentrate on the origin and spread of evil in the world. We soon realize that the insistence on the perfection of the prelapsarian state has as its purpose to absolve 3. Cf. U. Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis, Part I: From Adam to Noah, trans. I. Abrahams (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1978), p. 34. 199</page><page sequence="4">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS God of any responsibility for this worsening state of affairs. Had material goods been in short supply from the start, human beings would have been caught up in a life and death struggle for survival and injustice could have been viewed as a natural neces- sity, calling God's goodness into question. As matters stand, Adam and his descendants have themselves to blame for the evils they commit or from which they suffer. Adam is not called "good" apart from the rest of creation precisely because he was capable of going astray and, as the rest of the narrative shows, did in fact go astray. Once introduced into the world, human wickedness will increase as time goes on, until God, noticing that "every imagination of the thoughts of [man's] heart was evil continually," decides to "blot him out" (6:5-7), sparing only Noah and his family, along with a male and female of every species of animals. Shortly thereafter, God establishes an explicit covenant with all living creatures, vowing never again to destroy them by means of a flood and reconfirming the human being as master of the earth, but this time under less than ideal conditions. An attempt is nevertheless made to approximate the original conditions by promoting a strong sense of reverence for life. For the first time, murder is expressly forbidden and provisions are made for the punishment of the murderer. No doubt, man's relations with the animal kingdom have become less peaceful inasmuch as the rule of vegetarianism is allowed to lapse (9:3); but, unlike the myths of the Golden Age with which it shares this rule, the Bible specifies that with the arrival of the messianic era vegetarianism will be restored not only for human beings but for carnivorous beasts as well. In Isaiah's words, "the lion shall eat straw like the ox" (11:7). A similar concern for dumb animals and the rest of nature reappears in various other biblical books. Exodus 23:12 sets the seventh day of the week aside as a day of rest for one's asses and oxen. Leviticus declares that each seventh year is to be a sabbath or year of solemn rest during which one's field is not to be sown (25:2-5). Deuteronomy 20:19-20 stipulates that, when a siege is laid to a city, care should be taken not to destroy fruit-bearing trees; only trees that bear no fruit are to be used to build siegeworks. Such ordinances are motivated neither by a belief in the sacredness of nature nor by a sentimental attachment to it. 200</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE The Bible's outlook is rather more down to earth. Animals and plants are to be kept in good health lest their utility to human beings should be lost or diminished. Less evident but by no means absent is a desire on the part of the sacred writers to inculcate habits of gentleness among human beings by discour- aging cruelty to animals. Also to be noted is the Bible's profound admiration for the splendor and orderliness of nature. Nowhere is this more evident than in the so-called creation psalms. Psalm 8 speaks of the heavens not simply as the work of God's hands but as the work of his "fingers," thereby stressing its surpassing delicacy. Psalm 104 dwells on the solicitude of a loving God who looks after all his creatures, both human and subhuman, providing for each its shelter and its food in due season: trees for birds to nest in, high mountains for wild goats, rocks as a refuge for badgers, bread to strengthen our hearts and wine to gladden them. None of this adds up to a full-blown ecotheology, nor, since Sacred Scripture is not long on speculations of this kind, can any such theology be expected of it. Still, if these few texts and others like them signify anything, it is that there is ample biblical sup- port for the reasonable demands of the present-day ecological movement. Human beings are not to worship nature, but neither have they been given a blank check to do whatever they please with it. As the stewards or custodians rather than the owners of creation, they are to care for it and "guard" it (Gen. 2:15). Besides, if human beings are urged to respect life in general and forbid- den unjustly to take any human life, their own or anyone else's, it follows that they are not to destroy or inflict unnecessary damage on the physical environment needed to sustain that life. The Greeks and Nature By and large, the same perspective was shared by the tradition of philosophy that came to dominate in the West and that traces its origin to Plato and Aristotle. I limit myself to a few remarks about Aristotle, the first philosopher to come up with a bonafide science of nature and the author of a book on the subject, the Physics, to which, in an essay that did much at the time to rekindle interest in Aristotelian philosophy, Heidegger refers as "the 201</page><page sequence="6">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS hidden, and therefore never adequately studied, foundational book of Western philosophy."4 Heidegger's statement is all the more pertinent as Aristotelian physics was long thought to have been dealt a fatal blow by the stupendous advances of modern physical science. Certainly, much of what Aristotle says about nature needs to be reformulated in the light of more recent scientific discoveries. The question is whether the same is true of his highest principles as laid out in the Physics, a work less dependent on a detailed observation of natural phenomena than the ones that follow it in methodical order in the Aristotelian corpus, or, more generally, whether the whole Aristotle's natural science has been superseded and rendered obsolete by modern science. The heart of the Aristotelian enterprise is the well-known and now almost universally contested thesis that nature acts for an end. This principle applies to inanimate as well as animate beings, all of which are said to be ordered to a determinate end or ends and endowed with a constitution suited to the attainment of these ends, along with an inclination to pursue them and rest in them once they have been attained. As used in the Physics, nature is defined as the primary and intrinsic principle of motion and rest in beings that are subject to change (2. 192b22), that is, beings composed of matter and form and thus capable of motion of one kind or another: local, quantitative, or qualitative. It is remark- able, for instance, that plants, animals, and human beings grow until they reach a certain size and then just as mysteriously stop growing. Mobility, the most universal characteristic of such be- ings, is the formality under which all of them can and must be studied. If everything around us were perfectly stationary, there would be no natural science. Only in the light of the end to which this mobility is ostensibly directed can we make sense of the regularities that we observe in the operations of nature. As distinguished from, say, mathematics, which involves neither common matter nor motion and limits itself to formal and efficient causes, physics carries out its demonstrations by means of arguments based of all four causes, of which the final cause is not only the highest but the one that commands the other 4. "On the Being and Conception of Phusis in Aristotle's Physics B,1," Man and World 9 (August 1976): 224. - 202</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE three. To use Aristotle's example, taken from the more familiar realm of art, a saw is made of metal and given a serrated form because its purpose is to cut wood, something it would not be able to do if it lacked teeth or were itself made of wood. The end is what dictates the form and the matter, and not vice versa (2. 199b34f). These commonsensical remarks should not blind us to the fact that, of Aristotle's four determinate causes, the final cause is the one that is hardest to understand and most vulnerable to attack, as is clear from the ridicule that has been heaped upon it in modern times. Although the principle that all of nature acts for an end is taken by Aristotle to be self-evident and hence uninferable from prior premises, it still demands the most careful examination. We know that nature acts for an end not because it always succeeds but because it sometimes fails. If the result of its operations were identical in every single instance, it could be attributed to the necessity of matter. There would be no reason to think, for example, that rain falls from the clouds because it is needed to make corn grow and not simply as a consequence of the interplay of the mechanical laws of condensation, gravity, and the like (2. 198b17ff). The appeal to any other kind of agency to explain its occurrence would be superfluous. Likewise, if na- ture exhibited no regularity whatever, if anything could come about at any time as in fairy tales, if acorns gave birth to oaks one day and to elephants the next, if all events were chance events (in which case we could not identify them as chance events), in short, if there were no "natures," the question of finality would not arise. The clue to the existence of this finality is that nature sometimes falls short of the mark. But it also hits it, accomplish- ing for the most part what is manifestly good for the individual or the species. It is "better" for human beings to be born with eyes that see and feet that enable them to walk, as a majority of them are, than to be born blind or with a club foot. The habitual though not infallible recurrence of something that redounds to the good of a particular being or kind of being is what compels us to speak of it as intended by nature. From these sketchy remarks one begins to glimpse the chasm that separates classical science from modern science. For classical science, all natural beings tend toward a specified end, regardless of whether they attain it or not. Their behavior may differ on 203</page><page sequence="8">204 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS occasion, but the end remains the same. For modern science, there is typically no preordained end, but the behavior is univer- sally the same. All that counts is the regularity and unfailing predictability with which it occurs. The difference between these opposing views is well brought out by two texts from the early modern period, one by Hooker, which reflects the old view, and the other by Spinoza, which reflects the new. The first occurs in Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, I,ii: All things that are have some operation not violent or casual. Neither does anything ever begin to exercise the same without some fore- conceived end for which it works. And the end which it works for is not obtained unless the work be also fit to obtain it by. For unto every end every operation will not serve. That which assigns to each thing the kind, that which moderates the force and power, that which appoints the form and measure of working, the same we term a Law. It matters little in this instance that the end is not always achieved. What does matter is that all things, whether they be human beings or stones, have such an end, and it is with a view to this end that we are able to grasp their nature. The second text makes no reference whatever to a possible end and stresses only the universal sameness of the operations. Such is the view that underlies the whole of modern science. What it ultimately entails is the absence of any essential differ- ence between animate and inanimate or between rational and nonrational beings. If there is no end, there is no nature that corresponds to it. In Spinoza's words: The term law, taken in the abstract, means that by which an individual, or all things, or as many things as belong to a particular species, act in one and the same fixed and definite manner, which manner depends either on natural necessity or on human decree.5 Let us assume that nature is ordered to an end. What end? Upon analysis, that end can be shown to be twofold. There is, 5. Theologico-Political Treatise, chap. 4, init. Cf. Descartres, Discourse on Method, Part 5, init.: ".... I have also discovered certain laws, which God has so established in nature, and the notion of which he has so fixed in our minds, that after sufficient reflection we cannot doubt that they are exactly observed in all which exists or which happens in the world" (trans. L. J. Lafleur [Indianapolis, 1960], p. 31).</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE first of all, the end that is intrinsic to the being itself and which is none other than its perfection or full development, both physical and, in the case of human beings, moral and intellectual. This much is implied in the definition of nature as a principle of motion and rest inherent in all natural beings. The end to which in the first instance the process is ordered is the form of the whole, a being that is complete insofar as it is endowed with all the powers, properties, or characteristics of its species. It is in this sense that Aristotle is able to say in the Politics that "what each thing is when fully developed we call its nature" (1. 1252b32), and, in the Poetics, that "having gone through many changes, tragedy stopped when it attained its nature" (4. 1449a5). Beyond this intrinsic end, there is the extrinsic end to which all nonhuman species are ordered, namely, the human or rational being, who is the measure of all things in the material universe. From an Aristotelian perspective, the human being cannot be a mere accident on the face of the earth, an aberrant primate spe- cies, or the product of a blind evolutionary process; for without the presence of such a being the world in which we live becomes unintelligible. Since mind is clearly at work in nature, under- stood as an extrinsic participation in reason on the part of nonrational beings, the material universe requires for its perfec- tion that it contain within itself that by means of which it is able to attain its end or return to its principle. At least one of its parts must be gifted with reason and hence essentially different from all the other parts in that it is the only one capable of knowing the whole. Thus, from the principle that nature does nothing in vain, Aristotle infers that plants exist for the sake of animals and nonrational animals for the sake of rational animals.6 What human beings can appropriately do in their dealings with subrational nature is determined either by nature itself or by reason guided by nature. An example of this is hunting, a species of the natural art of acquisition, which, as Aristotle is careful to point out, is not unlimited but limited by human need.7 One final remark on this subject. If nature is indeed permeated with mind or reason, we can study it with the expectation that, 6. Cf. Politics 1. 1256b15f. Aristotle's notion of extraspecific finality is proper to the Politics. It is not mentioned in the Physics, which deals only with things that are common to all of nature, both animate and inanimate. 7. Politics 1.1256b28f. 205</page><page sequence="10">206 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS even though its material component rules out the possibility of our ever attaining an exhaustive knowledge of it, nothing a priori prevents our being able to learn more and more about it. Given the manifest presence of finality in some of its parts, it is hard to see why it would not be present in other parts as well (cf. Physics 2. 196a25f). I know of no text that gives us a better feel for the spirit of Aristotle's natural science than the passage from Book I, chapter 5 of the treatise On the Parts of Animals, where one reads: Of the things that exist by nature some are ungenerated, imperish- able, and eternal, while others are subject to generation and decay. The former are excellent beyond compare and divine, but less accessible to knowledge. The evidence that might throw light on them, and on the problem that we long to solve respecting them, is furnished but scantily by sensation; whereas respecting perishable plants and animals we have abundant information, living as we do in their midst, and ample data may be collected concerning all their various kinds, if only we are willing to take sufficient pains. Both departments, however, have their special charm. The scanty conceptions to which we can attain of celestial things give us, from their excellence, more pleasure than all our knowledge of the world in which we live; just as a half glimpse of persons whom we love is more delightful than a leisurely view of other things, whatever their number and dimensions. On the other hand, in certitude and in completeness our knowledge of terrestrial things has the advantage. Moreover, their greater nearness and affinity to us balances somewhat the loftier interest of the heavenly things that constitute the object of the higher philosophy. Having already treated of the celestial world, as far as our conjec- tures could reach, we proceed to treat of animals, without omitting, to the best of our ability, any member of the kingdom, however ignoble. For if some have no graces to charm the senses, yet even these, by disclosing to intellectual perception the artistic spirit that designed them, give immense pleasure to all who can trace links of causation and are inclined to philosophy. Indeed, it would be strange if artistic representations of them were attractive because they disclose the mimetic skill of the painter or sculptor, and the original realities themselves were not more interesting, to all at any rate who have eyes to discern the reasons that determined their formation. We must therefore not recoil with childish aversion from the ex- amination of the humbler animals. Every realm of nature is marvelous; and, as Heraclitus, when the strangers who came for a visit found him warming himself at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, is reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even in that kitchen divinities were present, so we should venture on the study of every kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal to us</page><page sequence="11">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE something natural and something beautiful. Absence of randomness and conduciveness of everything to an end are to be found in nature's works in the highest degree, and the resultant end of her generations and combinations is a form of the beautiful." Medieval theologians may have been uneasy with some of Aristotle's assumptions about nature, but they could not fail to be struck by the affinity between his views on this matter and the teachings of their faith. What Aristotle saw as the work of an eternal nature they could and did attribute to the wisdom of the divine artisan of Chapter 1 of Genesis. Western Christianity and the Ecological Crisis: Lynn White's Bombshell In view of the enormous respect shown for nature by both the theological and the philosophic traditions, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that the blame for the ecological catastrophe for which we appear to be headed is now being laid at the door of Western Christianity. Yet this is exactly what assorted philosophers and historians of science have been doing for the past twenty-five years or so. The landmark document in this regard is Lynn White's celebrated essay, "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis," originally delivered as an address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1966, published as an article in the 10 March 1967 issue of Science, and reprinted over and over again in the years that followed.9 The success of White's essay was due in large part to the bluntness with which it makes its point, namely, that Christianity "bears a huge burden of guilt" for the devastation of nature in which the West has been engaged for centuries. By not only allowing but commanding human beings to "subdue the earth" and "exercise dominion over every living thing" (Gen. 1:26-28), 8. R. P. Hardie and R. K.

As the chief purveyor of this mentality, Christianity declared open season on nature, to which it denies any intrinsic worth and which it subordinates entirely to the fulfillment of human purposes. No religion, we are told, was ever more "anthropocentric." Moreover, by teaching that time takes its course along a straight line rather than in cycles, Christianity laid the groundwork for the idea of progress, thus accrediting one of the main presuppositions of modern science, the tool par excellence of man's subjugation of nature. The disenchantment of nature effected on a popular level by the triumph of biblical monotheism led to the same dire consequences. For centuries, pagan "animism," which looked upon trees, rivers, fountains, and various other natural sites as the dwelling places of divinities, had functioned as a curb on the human propensity to ravage nature. With the removal of these taboos, the old inhibitions crumbled. The "sacred grove" vanished and for the first time human beings felt free to "exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural objects."10 This prompts White to describe Christianity's victory over paganism as the "greatest psychic revolution in the history of our culture." Nor does it make any difference to White that we now live in a post-Christian age, for even though many in the West have rejected Christianity, their daily habits continue to be tacitly informed by it. The faith in perpetual progress that supports them is "rooted in, and indefensible apart from, Judeo-Christian teleology."" Marxism, for all its open hostility to religion, is a Christian heresy. Galileo was more of a theologian than a scien- tist, condemned not because of his "errors" but because the theologians of his time objected to his poaching on their grounds- further proof that the whole of "modern Western science was cast in a matrix of Christian theology."12 White's stinging diatribe imparted an ironic twist to a story that had been unfolding since the beginning of the nineteenth century. In an effort to counter the Enlightenment slogan that religious belief was an obstacle to scientific progress, a number of 10. Machina ex Deo, p. 86. 11. Ibid., p. 85. 12. Ibid.. p. 89. 208</page><page sequence="13">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE apologists for the Christian faith had embarked on a project the aim of which was to demonstrate that Christianity was not only open to modem science but had actually given birth to it. Joining their ranks toward the end of the century was the eminent French physicist and philosopher of science, Pierre Duhem, whose pio- neering research on John Buridan and Nicholas Oresme, two hitherto little known fourteenth-century Aristotelians, seemed to have uncovered the source of Newton's first law of motion. A devout Christian, Duhem ran into stiff resistance on the part of the anticlerical establishment of his day. His work attracted little attention in his own lifetime and was virtually ignored for many years after his death in 1916 at the age of fifty-six. Official opposition to him was such that the last five volumes of his major work, Le Systeme du monde, were not published until the 1950s, some forty years later.'3 The overall accomplishment was nonetheless impressive, especially in view of that fact that the information contained in this work as well as in the three hefty volumes of his Etudes sur Leonard de Vinci and several other important studies had to be painstakingly dug out of unedited manuscripts to which Duhem, stranded as it were in a provincial university (Bordeaux) where he taught for the last twenty-one years of his life, did not have ready access. Duhem's thesis, which is also part of White's argument, is that the old cyclical notion of time had to be jettisoned before modem science could come into its own and that Christianity is the religion that had finally "laid it to rest." Duhem went so far as to identify the moment of its birth with the famous condemna- tion of what is now called Latin Averroism by the bishop of Paris, Etienne Tempier, in 1277. Modern science, he wrote, "was born, one may say, on March 7, 1277, from a decree issued by Monsi- gnor Tempier, bishop of Paris. A principal objective of the present work will be the justification of this assertion."'4 The meaning of 13. For a lively account of this strange story, cf. S.

In volume 2 of the same work, he writes with considerable eloquence: We hear it said that the very slow changes of the earth are linked to the almost imperceptible movement of the fixed stars, whose revolution is supposed to measure the Great Year. To the building of this system, all the adepts of Greek philosophy-Aristotelians, Stoics, Neoplatonists- have contributed one after another. To it Abou Masar offered the tribute of the Arabs. Such is the system that, from Philo of Alexandria to Maimonides, the most illustrious rabbis have adopted. To condemn it as a monstrous superstition and lay it to rest, Christianity was needed.'5 The problem to which Duhem adverts was the central theo- logical problem of the Middle Ages, namely, the conflict that pitted Aristotelian necessitarianism against divine freedom, or, differently stated, Aristotle's eternal world against the created world of biblical revelation. In point of fact, the notion of the Great Year had been discarded by important thinkers long before the advent of Christianity. Aristotle disposed of it with the obser- vation that people believe in the cyclical nature of time because of the circular motion of the heavenly bodies by which we mea- sure it.16 Yet Duhem's argument was not without force. By ascrib- ing the origin of the universe to the will of an omnipotent God, medieval theology demanded that it be studied, not as it reveals itself to us in the light of nature's own immutable principles, but as it actually is by divinefiat. For this, a much greater reliance on Science and Creation: From Eternal Cycles to an Oscillating Universe (Edinburgh/ London: Scottish Academy Press, 1974), pp. 229-30.

Vol. 3 of Duhem's Etudes sur LIonard de Vinci is dedicated "To the glory of the Faculty of Arts of Paris, the true mother of our experimental science." Buridan had taught at the University of Paris and Oresme spent some time there as a younger man. 15. Ibid., vol. 2 (reprinted, 1954), p. 390.

As for Plato, it is hard to draw any definite conclusion from the discussion of the "perfect year" in the Timaeus (38b-39e) and the parallel discussions in Statesman (269c-273e) and Epinomis (991c).

It is in this sense that modem experimental science can be said to rest squarely on a foundation of theological voluntarism and nominalism. The thesis to which Duhem was committed-let us call it the "continuity thesis"17-later received indirect support from no less a figure than Alfred North Whitehead, who defended it on slightly different philosophical grounds. The new argument, which is set forth in Chapter 1 of Science and the Modern World, entitled "The Origins of Modern Science," is that any attempt to apply the criteria of reason to the study of nature is based on the prior assumption that nature is governed by rational principles and hence amenable to scientific treatment. Were it not for the belief in the orderliness, inner consistency, and predictability of nature, the "incredible labours of scientists would be without hope" and probably would never have been undertaken in the first place. What motivates scientific research is the "instinctive conviction" that there is in nature "a secret that can be unveiled."18 As the precondition rather than the product of science, this conviction cannot have originated in science itself. It has one and only one source, namely, "the medieval insistence on the rationality of God, conceived as with the personal energy of Jehovah and with the rationality of the Greek philosopher." This, according to Whitehead, is the greatest contribution of medievalism to the formation of the scientific movement. Faith and science, those two great antagonists of the modern world, have more in common than the age-old rivalry between them would lead us to believe, to such an extent that the former must be seen as the necessary condition of the latter. Simply put, "faith in the possibility of science, generated antecedently to the development of scientific theory, is an unconscious derivative from medieval theology."19 Although Whitehead was probably unaware of it-he was not an avid reader of nineteenth-century German philosophy- 17. On the highest philosophic level, that thesis can be traced back to Hegel, for whom "modernity originated in an historical development out of Christianity," as is rightly noted by R. Faulkner, Francis Bacon and the Project of Progress (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 1993), p. 12. 18. A. N. Whitehead, Science in the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1931), p. 18. 19. Ibid., p. 19. 211</page><page sequence="16">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS the same point had already been made by Nietzsche, who argued that science, long looked upon as Christianity's mortal enemy, is not a genuine alternative to it but a parasite that lives off of it. "Strictly speaking," he wrote, "there is no such thing as science 'without any presuppositions'... a philosophy, a 'faith,' must always be there first, so that science can acquire from it a direc- tion, a meaning, a limit, a method, a right to exist. ... It is still a metaphysicalfaith that underlies our faith in science" (Nietzsche's underscorings).20 By attacking Christianity, science was not de- stroying an adversary, it was merely cutting itself off from its roots. Nietzsche's analysis is particularly valuable insofar as it brings to light the hidden premise of Whitehead's position: in a world that considers reason to be superficial, denies that there is any part of the human being that is not intrinsically dependent on matter, and claims to have replaced the "will to truth" with the "will to power," the foundations of everything become by defini- tion nonrational or "religious" in the Nietzschean sense. All "values," science included, originate in the mysterious or godlike recesses of the creative self. Both approaches, Duhem's and Whitehead's, were later rolled into one by the British scholar and Oxford fellow, Michael B. Foster, in a series of widely read articles the most important of which appeared in Mind between 1934 and 1936.21 Like many of his predecessors, Foster endorses the continuity thesis but limits it to the impact of "a certain form of Christian theology" on the "methods of the moder a priori sciences," such as those of Bacon and Descartes. His overarching principle is that any change in one's natural theology entails a corresponding change in one's understanding of nature. More sensitive than either Duhem or Whitehead to the difference between the premoder and the moder conceptions of nature, Foster finds in the advent of 20. Nietzsche, Genealogy of Morals, III. 23-24. Also, along the same lines, The Gay Science, Aph. 344. 21. M. B.

The three articles are reprinted in Creation, Nature, and Political Order in the Philosophy of Michael Foster (1903-1959): The Classic Mind Articles and Others, with Modern Critical Essays, ed. C. Wybrow (Lewiston, NY, 1992). 212</page><page sequence="17">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE 213 Christianity, with its radical monotheism and its notion of divine omnipotence, the only factor capable of accounting for this difference. If I refer to Foster's provocative but not unproblematic articles,22 it is only to indicate that the continuity thesis had gradually become a common staple of twentieth-century scholarly literature.23 Duhem was vindicated at last. Posthumously, anonymously, and in circuitous ways, his zeal had paid off. I say "anonymously" because he is not mentioned by either Whitehead or Foster and appears to have been kept at a safe distance by most historians of science.24 The conspiracy of silence around him was not officially broken until 1974 when, in its fifteenth edition, the Encyclopedia Britannica devoted a brief twenty-five- line biographical notice to him. 22. There is some question as to whether on its own terms Foster's argument is entirely consistent. It holds that the modem scientific view of nature is "more truly Christian" than the Aristotelian view and, almost in the same breath, that modem natural science was designed as an instrument for the domination of nature and hence destructive of the respect owed to nature as the work of God. See Foster's later article, "Some Remarks on the Relations of Science and Religion," The Christian Newsletter, Supplement to No. 299, 26 November 1947, pp. 5-16; reprinted in Wybrow, Creation, Nature, and Political Order, pp. 149-60. 23. By 1934, Lynn Thomdike was ready to concede Duhem's point about some of the medieval antecedents of modem science, although he was careful to dissociate himself from any of the larger conclusions that one might be tempted to draw from that fact; cf. A History of Magic and Experimental Science, Vol. 4: Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries (New York: Columbia University Press), p. 615: "Then presently seeds that had lain dormant since the fourteenth century were, as Duhem has shown, to sprout and fructify in modem philosophy and science. Frankly, it is not for this contribution towards modernity that we most prize these writings of two remote centuries which we have been at some pains to decipher and to set forth. We have taken them as we have found them and we esteem them for what they are in their totality, their fourteenth and fifteenth century complexio-a chapter in the history of human thought. Read it and smile or read it and weep, as you please. We would not credit it with the least particle of modem science that does not belong to it, nor would we deprive it of any of that magic which constitutes in no small measure its peculiar charm." 24. On Duhem's treatment at the hands of George Sarton and other historians of science, cf. S. Jaki, The Origin of Science and the Science of Its Origins (South Bend, IN: Regnery, 1978), pp. 74-79; The Road of Science and the Ways to God (Chicago/London: University of Chicago Press, 1978), pp. 12-14. According to Sarton, Duhem was "carried away by his enthusiasm and by his desire to magnify the Schoolmen and belittle Galileo," Introduction to the History of Science, III, Part 1, p. 146n.</page><page sequence="18">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS By that time, the ecological wars touched off by White's bomb had been raging for several years and both Christianity and modem science were under fire for the part they allegedly played in provoking the crisis. The attack left Duhem's major premise untouched-Christianity is the mother of modem sci- ence-but not the rest of the syllogism, which now ran as follows: But modern science is bad; therefore, Christianity, too, must be bad. It is providential that Duhem was not alive to witness the paradoxical triumph of the proposition to the defense of which he had dedicated his life.25 In fairness to White, himself an avowed Christian, it should be added that the target of his broadside was not Christianity as such but the form it began to take on when Aristotle was introduced into the fold in the course of the thirteenth century. Hence his plea for the return to an earlier form of Christianity, the one exemplified by St. Francis and the Franciscan movement. For some reason, few people were ready to second White's nomination of St. Francis as the patron saint of ecologists. Other factors, such as Francis's alleged antifeminism, may have intervened to block it. The Crisis of Modern Science and the Integration of Man into Nature This is not the place to engage in a point-by-point discussion of the skewed argument by which White sought to nail down his thesis, especially since it has frequently been criticized by competent scholars from the standpoint of both its logic and its historical accuracy.26 One is surely entitled to ask whether Galileo 25. Duhem was not the only one to fall into the trap. To mention only one other name, the same thing seems to have happened to the well-known Protestant theologian Langdon Gilkey. See, for example, Maker of Heaven and Earth: A Study of the Christian Doctrine of Creation (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1959). 26. For a survey of the abundant literature spawned by White's thesis, cf. R. A. Gray, "Theological Responses to Environmental Decline: An Annotated Bibliography," Reference Services Review 22 (November 1994): 69-94. Also, on this general subject, J. Passmore, Man's Responsibility for Nature: Ecological Problems and Western Traditions, 2nd ed. (New York, 1980); and, for a balanced, penetrating, and up-to-date assessment of the ecological movement as a whole, Ch. T. Rubin, The Green Crusade: Rethinking the Roots of Environmentalism (New York: The Free Press, 1994). I 214</page><page sequence="19">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE was taken to task more for his unauthorized forays into the domain of theology than for his scientific theories.27 I, for one, find more fruitful Jacques Monod's astute remark that the Catholic church was right to condemn Galileo but that it condemned him for the wrong reason, namely, for his heliocentrism rather than for his rejection of Aristotelian teleology.28 The same goes for the theory that, by ridding us of animism, biblical monotheism unleashed a campaign of destruction against nature. Refurbishing G. E. Stahl's early eighteenth-century animistic speculations at this late date and attributing feelings to inanimate nature, as White does, is not likely to advance the cause of either science or the ecological movement. Unless one reads the myth of the Timaeus as a scientific treatise, one cannot possibly impute to Plato the notion that the whole of nature is a huge animal.29 Timaeus's fanciful account of the origins of the cosmos (29d-33c) appears to be nothing but a protracted metaphor for the unity, beauty, and intelligibility of the universe, problematic as these may ultimately be. Finally, one is at a loss to explain how the biblical and medieval conception of the visible world as an elaborate system of symbols all pointing to the existence of an invisible and infinitely more beautiful reality could have been construed by Christians as a signal to embark upon a systematic desecration of nature. The image of creation as God's handiwork calls for the exact opposite, to wit, a much higher regard for nature than one might otherwise have for it.30 White's argument not only gravely distorts premodern thought, it obscures the true nature of modern science. The latter, 27. On Galileo's relations with the theologians of the Roman College, cf. Wm. Wallace, Galileo and His Sources: The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984). Wallace's book, like so many others, stresses the kinship rather than the break between Galileo and premodem science. 28. "On Values in the Age of Science," Aspen Institute Readings, ed. M. Krasney (New York: Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, 1978), p. 86. 29. The charge of animism leveled at Plato by Foster in the abovementioned articles is based on just such a fundamentalist interpretation of the Platonic myth. 30. On this score, one does well to remember that the Bible attributes the discovery of the arts and sciences, according to White the instruments of man's callous treatment of nature, to the progeny of the reprobate Cain; cf. Gen. 4:17-22. 215</page><page sequence="20">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS properly understood, is not a product of the Christian tradition, however hard its promoters may have tried for political reasons to give that impression. It arose by way of a reaction against it and was militantly opposed to it from the start as regards both its goals and its method of procedure. Unlike Aristotelian and Scho- lastic science, which Bacon compares to a sterile virgin, it was ordered to the production of results, that is, inventions that would contribute to the relief of man's estate.31 Its ambition was not to contemplate nature but to conquer it as one conquers an enemy; to enlarge our power over it;32 to establish human beings, not indeed as its "guardians" or stewards, as the Bible had done, but as its "masters and possessors."33 Therein lies the ambiguity of White's essay, which confuses the two meanings of "mastery" or "dominion." When the Bible uses the word, it is always in its primary sense, the dominus or "master" being the one who rules his subordinates for the good of the whole rather than for his own private good. Baconian mastery is different. It is achieved by observing nature under conditions other than those under which it habitually finds itself, doing violence to it, and "putting it to the question," an expression meant to evoke the horrors of the Inquisition. The real difference between premodern and modern science is not, as is often said, that one is deductive and the other inductive, that is to say, based on experience, but that modern science relies on a new kind of experience, one that takes nature out of its normal state and subjects it to the "constraints" and 31. See, for example, Bacon, New Organon, I. 129, where inventors are ranked above statesmen as humanity's greatest benefactors. 32. Cf. New Organon, II. 52, end. 33. Cf. Descartes, Discourse on Method, Part VI, init. To glimpse the antibiblical thrust of Cartesian philosophy, one has only to look at Descartes's reworking of Genesis 1 in Part 5 of the Discourse on Method. The main elements of the original story are clearly present: the chaos with which it begins, followed by the creation of the sky, light, the sun and the stars, and the earth. At that moment, the story is interrupted by a lyrical account of the miraculous properties of fire and how it can be used to turn ashes into glass, for Descartes a phenomenon as admirable as any that occurs in nature and which he confesses to have taken untold pleasure in describing. Inserting a purple patch such as this one just prior to the creation of animals and the human being is Descartes's way of insinuating that science can do a better job of explaining the origin of the human soul than does the Bible, which has God breathe the breath of life into the nostrils of the man He had formed from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7). - 216</page><page sequence="21">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE "vexations" of an endless series of artificially devised experi- ments.34 The Moders, not Ancients, are the ones who put nature on the rack and thereby set up an adversarial relationship be- tween the investigator and the object of his investigation. My point is well illustrated by an incident that occurred when, for the first time (on 28 May 1953), Sir Edmund Hilary and his associate, Tenzing Norkay, reached the summit of Mount Everest, a feat that made headlines throughout the world. A prominent London daily ran an account of it under the title EVEREST CONQUERED, printed in bold letters across the top of its front page; to which an Indian student living in England at the time responded spontaneously: "Why 'Conquered'? Why not say instead, Everest 'Befriended'?" Underlying the new outlook is the view that nature is inimical or at least indifferent to human purposes and hence something to be beaten into submission and forced to yield to the will of a shrewder opponent. Human beings cannot take their bearings from it and are not directed by it to any good in the attainment of which they might find their perfection. As Hobbes puts it with characteristic bluntness in Leviathan, chapter 11, "There is no suchfinis ultimus, utmost aim, nor summum bonum, greatest good, as is spoken of in the books of the old moral philosophers." There is only a supreme evil, which we have no choice but to leave as far behind us as possible. The same negative attitude toward nature shows up again, among other places, in Hegel, about whom Emile Meyerson has written: ...[H]is contempt for nature is absolute. We do not believe that in the entire immense Hegelian corpus, although it pretends to embrace the 34. Cf. F. Bacon, "Plan of the Great Instauration," toward the middle. The difference between the two forms of induction is stressed by Bacon himself, who writes: "But the greatest change I introduce is in the form itself of induction and the judgment made thereby. For the induction of which the logicians speak, which proceeds by simple enumeration, is a puerile thing, concludes at hazard, is always liable to be upset by a contradictory instance, takes into account only what is known and ordinary, and leads to no result" (ibid., beginning). My interpretation of Bacon's relationship to Christianity accords in the main with that of R. Faulkner, Bacon, pp. 61-65 et passim. For a more "pious" interpretation within the context of the contemporary ecological debate, see.Wm. Leiss, The Domination of Nature (Boston: Beacon Press, 1972).

That was, surely, an innate predisposition, and his correspondence reveals that already, at the age of twenty-five, when he visited the Bernese Alps, the spectacle left him indifferent. The sight of the glaciers "has nothing of interest about it," it offers "nothing great or pleasing." The traveler finds in it "no satisfaction except that of having approached such a glacier" and judges that the bottom of the glacier resembles a very muddy street. In general, he observes that "neither the eye nor the imagination discovers in these shapeless masses any point whatever where the former could alight with pleasure and the latter find a subject of occupation or play." Reason perceives in them "nothing awe inspiring, nothing that imposes astonishment or admiration." The sight of those eternally dead masses, he adds, gave me "nothing more than the monotonous and, in the long run, boring impression: it is so [es ist so]." But perhaps even more characteristic of his attitude is the way he speaks of the starry sky. He finds the admiration Kant professed for this sublime spectacle to be foolish; it is a subject of constant derision for him, one to which he returns on several occasions. The immensity of the celestial spaces is an example of "bad infinity"; one must beware of any admiration or even surprise on its account, and as for the stars, they are quite simply comparable to an eruption on the skin.35 So much for the wonderful harmony that was once thought to exist between human and nonhuman nature. Little wonder that Hegel, a major contributor to the development of modern aes- thetics, should have seen fit to deny the imitative character of art and proclaim its independence from nature. If the preceding analysis is correct, the problem with which the ecological movement concerns itself is symptomatic of a deeper issue affecting the overall status of science in our society. Edmund Husserl argued fifty years ago that what we are wit- nessing today is not just a crisis in the sciences but a crisis of the sciences.36 Few thoughtful people still believe down deep that the answer to the problems generated by science is more science. At the same time, not too many of us are prepared to renounce the benefits of modem science, not only because we have been spoiled by them but because we are no longer able to survive without them. The only feasible alternative, it seems, is to look for a way 35. E. Meyerson, Explanation in the Sciences, trans. M.-A. and D. A. Siple (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991), pp. 357-58. 36.

This would require among other things a reconsideration of its metaphysical foundations on the one hand and of the fundamen- tal principles of Aristotelian science on the other. Specifically, it would force us to reopen, on the basis of our vastly increased knowledge of the physical world, the key issue of teleology to which reference was made in an earlier part of this article. It is reasonable to suppose that, were he to come back, Aristotle himself would be the first to revise some of his hypotheses regarding the structure of the universe, the laws of physics, the nature of matter, and any number of similar issues. Even the axiom that nature acts for an end has to be reformulated in a manner that takes into account the astronomical and other discoveries of more recent centuries. This is not to say, however, that it has been disproved by these discoveries. Spinoza was content to dismiss it as a pure and simple anthropomorphism without making the slightest effort to come to grips with Aristotle's argument in favor of it, so certain was he that the achievements of modern science had consigned it to the dustbin of history. True, one would never begin to look for final causes in nature if one were not acquainted with them from one's own experience, but this alone says nothing about whether or not they exist independently of one's experience. To this must be added the fact that Aristotelian teleology is often grossly oversimplified by his modern interpreters. Nature as Aristotle sees it operates on many levels and displays charac- teristics that vary greatly when we pass from one to another. The clearest example of its directedness to an end is the fall of a heavy body, which always takes place in the same way unless it is impeded by some obstacle. If I let go of the stone I am holding in my hand, it invariably and uniformly falls to the ground. The same is not true of plants, which send off shoots or limbs in various directions, and it is even less true of animals and human beings, whose patterns of behavior are subject to even greater variations. From this standpoint, plants are less natural than inanimate objects, animals less natural than plants, and human beings less natural than animals.37 37. A similar distinction can be made among man's spiritual activities. In the Ethics, Aristotle refers to moral habit as something that does not change easily 219</page><page sequence="24">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Further complications arise when one considers Aristotle's teaching concerning the fixity of the species, another point on which his thought is frequently misconstrued. Because of its relatively high degree of indeterminacy, nature is capable of all sorts of false starts, mistakes, failures, and monstrosities.38 The evolutionary process, if that is the right word for it, is not reversible after the manner of a mathematical equation. We have no way of deducing the various species one from the other, but neither is it necessary that we be able to do so. All that is required to guarantee the intelligibility of the natural order is that it have the capacity to sustain rational life. For all I know, we could get along without cockroaches and hippopotamuses, but we do need other things- food from plants and animals, water, air, heat, wood, and so forth-without which human life would be impossible or greatly impoverished. The amazing thing is not that there are useless or contingent species around39 but that the human being is more highly determined in his physical make-up than all other natural beings. We have multiple subspecies of dogs, snakes, spiders, or whatever it may be; to my knowledge no biologist has yet spoken convincingly of a subspecies of man. The reason for the greater determination in this instance is that, although the human being is less "natural" than all other natural beings, the exercise of his intellectual powers requires a certain bodily disposition that nature, which "never fails in what is necessary" (De Anima 3. 432b21), could not neglect to provide for him.40 The further implication of this whole doctrine is that even in their most spiritual activities human beings remain dependent "because it is like nature" (7. 1152b31), a "second nature," as was later said, thereby implying that moral virtue is more natural than intellectual virtue. 38. Cf. Physics 2. 199a34f. 39. Paleontologists calculate that, of the billions of species that have populated the earth at one time or another over the past three or four billion years, fully 99.9% have disappeared, sometimes as a result of the mass extinctions that have occurred at periodic intervals. See on this subject the recent books by N. Eldredge, The Miner's Canary: Unraveling the Mysteries of Extinction (New York, 1992), and D. M. Raup, Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck? (New York, 1992). 40. This much is suggested by Aristotle De Anima 2. 421b16-25, which stresses the greater perfection of the sense of touch in human beings and its peculiar relation to the life of the mind.

Not that the higher is reducible to the lower-nothing could be more contrary to Aristotle's thought-but only that it is so rooted in it as never to be able to emancipate itself totally from it. Approaching the issue in this manner would help to reintegrate the human being into nature and overcome the radical mind-matter dualism to which modem thought since Descartes, for whom animals were noth- ing but "machines," has accustomed us. It is significant that the liveliest intellectual debates of our time have not been between rival schools of modern thought- rationalists and empiricists, Kantians and Hegelians, Realists and Idealists, and so on-but between Ancients and Moderns. The impetus came from Martin Heidegger, who, in an attempt to "uproot" a philosophic tradition that had supposedly gone astray from the beginning and was ultimately responsible for the crisis we now face, was led to study Aristotle with a thoroughness that had not been seen since the thirteenth century. The project yielded unexpected results. To a good number of his students, the exhumed Aristotle proved more persuasive than Heidegger's critique of him. A plausible alternative had been uncovered in the light of which all of the fundamental problems could be reexamined. Enter the ecological movement, which, inconsistent or mis- guided as it may be at times, lent further credence to the notion that nature itself has something to teach us about our relation- ship to it. Our most urgent need is what I am tempted to call a new "Socratic turn" that, like the original Socratic turn, would both preserve science and restore it to its native human context. Modern science has explained many things and will no doubt explain many more as time goes on, although there is reason to think that it will never be able to explain everything.41 Natural beings are unfathomable, if only because one of their principles is matter, which is refractory to mind. There will always be more to them than we are capable of knowing. If one were to eat carrots as a biologist defines them, one would probably end up with a 41. Unlike Kant, Aristotle and his followers did not think it possible to draw in advance a firm line between what the human intellect can or cannot do. All virtue, including intellectual virtue, is demonstrated in its employment. One discovers what reason can do when it does it. 221</page><page sequence="26">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS terrible indigestion. Above all, modern science has yet to tell us how a mindless universe gave rise to mind. It can neither explain the scientist nor make room for him in its own universe. I hope scientists will forgive me if, in support of my modest proposal, I quote from a novel by the late Walker Percy, who writes in The Moviegoer, the book that made his reputation: Until recent years, I read only "fundamental" books, that is key books on key subjects.... Schroedinger's What Is Life?, Einstein's The Universe as I See It, and such. During those years, I stood outside the universe and tried to understand it. I lived in my room as an Anyone living Any- where and read fundamental books and only for diversion took walks around the neighborhood and saw an occasional movie. Certainly it did not matter to me where I was when I read such a book as The Expanding Universe. The greatest success of this enterprise, which I call my vertical search, came one night when I sat in a hotel room in Birmingham and read a book called The Chemistry of Life. When I finished it, it seemed to me that the main goals of my search were reached or were in principle reachable.... The only difficulty was that though the universe had been disposed of, I myself was left over. There I lay in my hotel room with my search over yet still obliged to draw one breath and then the next. But now I have undertaken a different kind of search, a horizontal search. As a consequence, what takes place in my room is less impor- tant. What is important is what I shall find when I leave my room and wander in the neighborhood. Before, I wandered as a diversion. Now I wander seriously and sit and read as a diversion. This is as good a recapitulation of the Socratic turn as one is likely to come across anywhere today. Socrates' turn toward human things did not necessitate the abandonment of his quest for the knowledge of nature. The two must somehow go hand in hand. Our task is to find a way of bringing them together again. The issue may be formulated more pointedly by means of an- other quotation from Percy's book: A regular young Rupert Brooke was I, "- full of expectancy." Oh the crap that lies lurking in the English soul. Somewhere it, the English soul, received an injection of romanticism which nearly killed it. That's what killed my father, English romanticism, that and 1930 science. A line from my notebook: 'Explore connection between romanticism and scientific objectivity. Does a scientifically minded person become a romantic because he is a left-over from his own science?' It took a novelist trained as a physician and a natural scientist to bring home to us in such vivid fashion the full import of the I 222</page><page sequence="27">CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE 223 divorce between our dehumanized natural science and our con- cerns as human beings. Percy was not thinking of the ecological movement, which was still in its infancy when The Moviegoer was written, but the question that his book raises about the typical modern scientist's lack of self-knowledge sheds far more light on the roots of our ecological crisis than does either the Bible or medieval theology.</page></plain_text>
