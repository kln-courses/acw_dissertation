<plain_text><page sequence="1">T'OUNG PAO LXXX (1994) CHINA'S SENSE OF UNITY AS SEEN IN THE EARLY EMPIRES BY MICHAEL LOEWE* By no means all those peoples who can justly claim to have founded an independent culture leave an account, or even a series of sug- gestions from which it may be inferred how they have viewed them- selves, their characteristics and their achievements. Nor can it necessarily be taken for granted that a people's view of their own qualities will be identical with such characteristics, if these can in fact be studied objectively. There are indeed cases in which an ethnic or a national pride has prompted the creation of a broadly acclaimed myth that accounts for a people's origin; in other instances the overt practices, policies and behaviour of a people disclose beyond doubt either a conscious sense of mission or an unconscious basis for self-confidence. In certain instances it may thus be safe to identify some of the characteristics that appear in different guises, informing a people's religious practices and artistic products, underlying their institutions and suffusing their literatures and traditions with elements that are active and irre- pressible. In this way the children of Israel reveal their view of themselves as the servants of God, chosen to spread his word; the free men of Athens as the devotees of man-created values in face of the jeal- ousy of the gods; or the citizens of Rome as the stern imposers of law, order and discipline among all humanity. More recently, the Japanese have sometimes seen themselves as a chosen people, su- perior in quality, and perhaps deriving from a separate act of cre- ation, from all others. There have been protagonists of a German claim to be the Herrenvolk; and the English have been said by one writer to have admired one of their own statesmen, of the nine- teenth century, because he embodied the qualities that they most * I wish to acknowledge with thanks the generous help and valuable comments kindly given by Professor Shils in the preparation of this paper.</page><page sequence="2">CHINA'S SENSE OF UNITY 7 esteemed, i.e. those of impartiality, solidity and common sense.' It would need a bold scholar who would venture to generalise in respect of the view that the Chinese took of themselves in the early stages of their empires. For the diversities between the different parts of the land, the degrees of intellectual advance and the extent of independent artistic creation are often too wide to permit more than the formulation of certain questions. In addition the way to chart a correspondence between the various evidences of literature, religious observance and institutional framework is perhaps more hazardous than it may be for the cultural beginnings of Europe. It may perhaps nonetheless be possible to identify certain character- istic elements and to note occasions of conflict between pretence and hard reality. The following pages will attempt to show the context within which the Chinese of the early empires saw them- selves as existing; attention will then fasten on the ways in which a concept of China's unity was fostered and how far it could be regarded as valid. It is likely that most of those whose views were expressed in the literature of the early empires2 would have agreed that man occu- pies the central position between heaven and earth. By man they conveyed the idea of human beings irrespective of sex, and in some contexts they may even have thought of man as being representa- tive of other living creatures. Some of the references to heaven in this way may have implied an abstract concept; some may have had in mind all the members of the heavenly host, with the influence that they exerted on mankind; and the term earth may at times have been taken as comprising not only the crust and fabric of the globe but also its natural products of vegetation. In so far as man lay midway between heaven and earth, he was subject to the force of destiny (mingp,,), however that was con- ceived, whether as something imparted to him at birth, or decreed by an arbitrary heaven or the result of chance encounter with other objects or phenomena.3 Human beings were capable of acknowl- edging their inferiority in comparison with heaven and other powers 1 See Lytton Strachey on Lord Hartington, in Eminent Victorians (London: Chatto and Windus, new ed., 1921), p. 278. 2 The primary sources for this study will be found in works such as the Huainanzi; the three memorials of Dong Zhongshu; texts such as the Lunheng, Yantie lun or Qianfu lun; and in imperial decrees, and tracts and memorials of officials from Jia Yi to Cui Shi, as incorporated in the Standard Histories.

How far this relationship depended on rational thought and how far it de- rived from primaeval fears or urges may not be determined with certainty. The attitude to the world of nature varied. Some asserted that human beings were nothing more and nothing less than the other creatures found upon the earth; and in line with this view it could be assumed that all such creatures, including man, were capable of being transformed from one physical guise or shape to another, such as clam to bird, or man to tiger. Others would have insisted that man is superior to all animals by virtue of his intellectual powers and his ability to discriminate between right and wrong. Some perhaps would have stressed that alone of all creatures man possesses the skills of mastering the problems presented by the natural world, and that he is therefore obliged to apply those skills so as to ensure man's safety from disaster and to improve the con- ditions of life. Comparison and contrast between the Chinese and other peoples are to be found in historical and philosophical writing; here the Chinese regularly see themselves as being superior to all others; these are often described in highly pejorative terms, being com- pared with wild animals given to violence; or they are assumed to share none of the features of the civilised way of life enjoyed by the inhabitants of the Zhong guo 4MF and the heirs to the tradi- tion of Xia Xi, Shang M0 and Zhou ) . Such superiority obtrudes in various forms. It is stressed in the Chinese acknowledgment of li as a way of life; it is claimed by the attainment of sophisticated ways of living, inherited thanks to the gifts of the culture heroes of old and ennobled by the exercise of the arts; and it was part of Chinese pride to believe that their own intellectual attainments could not be matched by other peoples. Chinese writers see their practice of the art of sovereignty as being far more advanced than that of others such as the Xiongnu, who lacked formal organs of govern- ment and fixed territorial boundaries. Such peoples had no trained and literate civil service on which they could rely; above all, they had no belief in their destiny to rule mankind. Whatever the truth of such a view may be, it long remained part of the Chinese claim. It may be observed in this connection that the Chinese writers of the Qin and Han periods had no first hand knowledge of any of "Ming yi W"), 41f. (Forke, vol. I, pp. 136f.); and 3 (10 "Ou hui1%*"), 91f. (Forke, vol. II, pp. Ilf.).</page><page sequence="4">CHINA'S SENSE OF UNITY 9 the major civilised ways of life of the world other than their own. Had the Saka invasion of Northern India taken place after rather than before Zhang Qian's KW epic journey to Central Asia (c. 125 B.C.), he might well have brought back to Chang'an some account of a culture that worshipped its own gods, portrayed in anthropomorphic guise, with their prescribed formulae and rituals; of a city state whose government was based on the odd idea of popular assembly and the practice of rhetoric; of books written in a strange hand; or of a set of buildings planned on the principles of Pythagorean proportion and embellished with Hellenistic sculp- ture. Few Chinese observers who had witnessed such a way of life could, in all conscience, have denied that it included features of wen IC . The scorn expressed by writers and officials of the Han period for the alien comprised moral and material considerations. At the outset of the empire (200 B.C.) Lou Jing Yi pointed to the wick- edness of Modun , leader of the Xiongnu, who had killed his father and married his mother, being quite impervious to all con- cepts of ethical ideals, i.e. ren ii and yi d .4 At a later stage one of those who participated in the major debate of 81 B.C. is re- ported as reaffirming the view of Kong Zi that rnoral qualities, backed by a display of gifts that represented the fruits of Chinese culture, was the right way to impress the alien and to win the loyalty of the non-assimilated peoples.5 Li, seen perhaps as the symbolical expression of those values and the style of life that they engendered, thus featured as an important element in the ar- rangements for the visit that Huhanye o@@o1S, leader of the Xiongnu, was to pay to Chang'an in 51 B.C., and its importance is seen again in an incident that took place at Shanshan I# in A.D. 73.6 On a number of occasions the histories show the Chinese as being highly conscious of the contrast between themselves as farmers settled on the land or as inhabitants of the highly sophisticated cities, and the foreigners who led a mobile way of life without roots and without the benefit of a cultured society. How far this opinion was justified may perhaps be brought into question in the light of what is known now, but was perhaps unknown by the Chi- nese of Han times, of the people of the steppe.

Religious rites of those regions included human sacrifice; as compared with the use of iron tools in some of the Han commanderies, agricultural techniques may have been primitive. Chinese observers or reporters may well have fastened on such features in their reports, perhaps by way of flattery of their emperor's dispensation; they would perhaps have allowed little credit to the active practice of animal husbandry, in a manner not seen in the metropolitan north, and signified by the totem of the oxhead that adorned the roofs of the inhabitants' houses.8 Some time before 165 B.C. we hear of Chao Cuo AM, the states- man who served Wendi and Jingdi, describing the terrain of the north as "an area where Yin has accumulated, with trees whose bark is three inches thick and ice as deep as six feet; where the inhabitants eat meat and drink kumiss, without the benefit of a settled domicile".9 Later on, in Wei times, the same general con- trast is re-iterated;'0 but another instance, still in Han times, shows some measure of discrimination. In a context where matters of foreign policy were concerned, a writer contrasts the way of life of both the Xiongnu and the people of Wusun,%* , which is that of the mobile nomad, with the settled nature of some other, rather small states. These commanded the oases on the route around the Taklamakan desert; their friendship was essential if China's trade routes were not to be severed; they are therefore painted in more 7 For an account of the archaeological evidence for this statement, see N. di Cosmo, "The Economic Basis of the Ancient Inner Asian Nomads and its Rela- tionship to China" (Journal of Asian Studies, forthcoming). 8 Examples of these may be seen in the bronze models fitted to drumheads or other objects, found at Shizhaishan EXOtb; see The Chinese Bronzes from Yunnan (foreword by Jessica Rawson; London: Sidgwick and Jackson Ltd., and Beijing: Cultural Relics Publishing House, 1983), Plates 186, 190. 9 HS 49.12b (p. 2284). 10 Wei shu (Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1974) 54, p. 1201.</page><page sequence="6">CHINA'S SENSE OF UNITY 1 1 favourable terms than those which usually describe the potential enemies of the north.1` Chinese pride at their own higher standard of living and its material benefits is seen again in connection with foreign relations; e.g., in references to a display of wealth with which to impress the aliens and the provision of spectacles or games with which to entertain foreign dignitaries and win their loyalties.12 In more general terms, Han writers saw themselves as forming a link between the past and the future. As heirs of the past they recognised their duty of preserving the noble traditions of their predecessors and transmitting their principal lessons to their suc- cessors, at the cost of the modifications or compromise that time demanded. Some may have seen themselves as enacting an episode that lay along the path to the moral improvement and more general happiness of mankind; others may have regretted that their times were no more than yet another stage along the path that led away from the golden age in which such ideals had in fact been achieved. Those whose bent of mind is somewhat loosely termed "Confu- cian" saw themselves as being responsive to teaching and obliged to take positive steps to improve moral standards; others, who were content to follow the dao of the universe, saw themselves as awaiting a lead rather than initiating steps that would interfere with the natural evolutionary processes of the world and its inhabitants. At the other extreme were those who saw their prime duty as that of organizing the men and women of China so as to increase the power and wealth of their rulers to the greatest extent that would be possible. Chinese ideas of their own purpose and mission owed much to a mythology that placed them within the context of their past. It was as the heirs of the culture heroes of long ago that they possessed, or saw themselves possessing, the skills with which to control the forces of nature and to master practical skills. Mythology also told of the golden ages of the past when a succession of just monarchs had ruled the people of the earth and provided them with happi- ness, security and plenty. Some writers, such as the author of one of the later parts of the Zhuangzi,l3 rejected such a tale as false, being based on values that could not be sustained; but many of the writers and officials of Qin and Han looked to such examples as models that the kings and emperors of historical times would do well to emulate. 11 HS 96A.5b (p. 3872); CICA p. 73. 12 HS 96B.38a (p. 3928); CICA p. 201. 13 Zhuangzi 5B (14 "Tian yun iX "); Guo Qingfan WOM, Zhuangzi ji shi H+ffiw: Taipei: Hua sheng, 1991, p. 527.</page><page sequence="7">12 MICHAEL LOEWE Other highly important elements in the Chinese attitude towards themselves and their institutions lay in a unitary view of the uni- verse, a sense of hierarchy and a striving towards centrality. As participant members of the universe they occupied an acknowl- edged position whereby their lives and affairs formed an organic whole that should be in harmony with other parts of the cosmos. Systems of social distinctions, institutions of official posts and grades and ceremonies of worship or mourning alike depended on a sense of distinction and the acceptance of the privileges and duties that attended the different ranks. As compared with others who were less fortunate, the emperor's subjects saw themselves as superior by virtue of the cultural lead that they imparted, almost as part of a mission. This was manifest in their literature and artistic prod- ucts; in the organized control that they exercised over human be- ings; and in the moral purposes that they had inherited from their forbears and that they enjoined on their descendants. Such hierarchies depended alike on an insistence on the central position of the Chinese and their rulers and on the hope of estab- lishing a way of life that would place all mankind in harmony with their surroundings. Perhaps these ideals rested on myth rather than reality; possibly conflict and contradiction would be unavoidable in a search to implement them. The assumption that a Chinese dispensation formed a centre within a periphery is inherent in a number of concepts. It is seen in the stress laid on the Yellow River valley as the cradle of civilization, and in the scorn poured on the ways of life of the unlettered tribes who lived beyond the mountains that cut off the south, or even on the far bank of the Yangzi River itself. Arguments, by no means wholly acceptable, that China was in no way dependent on the products of elsewhere but was entitled to receive these as luxurious adjuncts to a self- sufficient way of life perhaps reflect the same belief.'4 The ideal of hierarchies and certrality is also basic to the scheme of inner and outer zones whereby a Chinese king or emperor's authority was seen to extend in decreasing strength as the distance from his seat of government grew progressively longer.1` It may perhaps also be detected in a symbolic device that features in a 14 For an exchange of views, see YTL 1 (3 "Tong youS "), pp. 19f.; Gale, pp. 18f. 15 E.g., see the traditional concepts if jiufu ASK , jiu ji A)t and wu fu EMU , e.g., in HS 96A.27a, CICA, p. 111.

This is that of the circle that encompasses the square, seen in the plan of at least one religious building of the Han age and frequently enough in the design of that highly power- ful talisman, the bronze mirror, buried to bring felicity to the rela- tive in whose tomb it was buried. On a more mundane and practical level coins were likewise shaped with a circle and square, doubt- less to allow the insertion of a leader thong; but coins were also used to leave an impression on the wet clay of the bricks and plaster-work of tombs; it is open to question how far they were chosen to do so in order to stress the idea of the centre and the periphery. 16 It is within this context that it may be asked to what extent the Chinese of the early empires saw themselves as a unity, and by what means they tried to express such a sense, and reference to other cultures suggests some criteria that may be excluded. Unity could not depend, as it might have done in Israel, on a faith in one God that was shared by all members of the community, all enjoy- ing the right and opportunity of worship; nor could there be a com- monly held conviction that a Chinese Jahweh would save his people from all ills and provide protection in return for their exclusive service. As yet there had been little attempt to analyse political concepts and their mode of achievement with a view to forming what would, on intellectual terms, be the most just and effective method of government. In this way Qin and Han China could not compare with Athens. Despite the long years spent by the pre- imperial kingdoms in fighting one another, there would be little compulsion to close the ranks and form a unity such as is engen- dered by oppression or persecution. Nor are there signs of a will- ingness to accept a rigorous discipline, applied universally, as the only means of ensuring survival in the face of natural disaster or military threat, as had been witnessed in Sparta and as would be seen in a number of the nations of the twentieth century. None of these conditions could apply to the China of the early empires, where the majority had no call or opportunity to worship a su- preme deity; where institutions were not subjected to public dis- as so termed by the men of learning, extend to no more than one of the 81 parts of the world beneath the skies...." 16 For the reconstruction of the building, identified as the PiyongW9, at a site south of Chang'an, see KGXB 1959.2, pp. 45-54; KG 1963.9, p. 501, and Michael Loewe, Ways to Paradise: the Chinese Quest for Immortality (London: George Allen and Unwin, Ltd, 1979), p. 14, fig. 1; for the circle and square in TLV mirrors, see Loewe, ibid., chapter 3.</page><page sequence="9">14 MICHAEL LOEWE cussion; and where no central policy could be implemented with sufficient cogency to enforce a discipline over so wide a territory. The Qin and Han empires comprised areas of different climates and terrain, inhabited by men of different ethnic origins, where different languages were spoken, and different types of occupation were practised. The population was spread anything but evenly over the land whose different regions, largely north of the Yangzi River, were subject to government of varying degrees of intensity and whose cultural standards were widely divergent (e.g. as between Shu M, Chu Q and the Metropolitan area). The style of living differed between the one extreme of the wealthy families, settled in their villas, and the other of a peasantry that scratched a living from the soil. The population worshipped a variety of gods, in ways that may have been sublime, cruel or barbaric. In the shel- tered academies of the north, scholars were explaining China's traditions and expounding their theories of living with a host of divergent interpretations. From time to time dynastic squabbles disclosed the lack of stability of the ruling house. In such circumstances a claim for unity must rest on a univer- sally acknowledged culture, enjoyed thanks to a universally ac- cepted political authority. In ideal terms, this was said to have been the achievement of the kings of Western Zhou, whose power had been brought to an end over five hundred years before empire had been established by the king of Qin in 221 B.C. In the mean- time, however, ideas had been voiced and experiments had been tried that were leading towards such a culmination. Some of the kings of the pre-imperial states had set themselves up to exercise the leadership of an overlord (ba 'U,) claiming the fealty of the other contemporaneous kings or rulers. Such arrangements, that lacked a religious or intellectual backing, had not stood the test of time."7 Later, in 288 B.C., an important innovation occurred when, for a period of less than a year, two of the most powerful kings of the day adopted titles that implied agreement to divide the rule of the world between them; in this way the king of Qin i would be known as the di of the west, and the king of Qi I* as the di of the east. 18 17 See Henri Maspero, China in Antiquity, translated by Frank A.

As is well known, it was rein- troduced, for a monarch who claimed powers on an entirely new scale, with the unification of 221 B.C. and the adoption of the new title of Huangdi , - .19 But as yet its implication of a single, united rule of the peoples of the earth had not gained full accep- tance. In 206 B.C. Xiang Yu &amp;M had envisaged a situation that drew on some of the characteristics of the pre-imperial age, with himself acting as overlord (ba) and no less than eighteen kings established in different areas, in a capacity that was regarded as inferior.20 The decrees of the Qin and Han emperors reveal various atti- tudes to united rule. In his initial discussion with his ministers the First Qin emperor told the tale of how unity had been achieved by the conquest of the other kingdoms. His attendants referred to the imposition of administrative organs (i.e. jun M and xian . ) uni- formly; and they added the telling sentence "The institutions and ordinances derive from a unified system (yitong -i), in a man- ner that has never been known before and was never attained by the Five Sovereigns (Wu di 3E ) of old". The emperor's inscrip- tions recorded the proud boast that he was the first to have held sway over the world, to the extent that there was not one person who had not submitted.21 In 196 Gaodi claimed that all the world formed a single family (yi jia -s), with the expectation that there would be no interruption in the services to the ancestral shrines 22 In 184 B.C. the Empress Lu suggested that the exercise of impe- rial rule was in the interests of humanity; she proclaimed "Those who hold possession of the world and keep its all too numerous inhabitants in order act as a protective cover like the skies and as a containing vessel like the earth".23 But perhaps the most cogent reference to the idea may be seen in one of the memorials of Dong Zhongshu *fPg{'. (c. 179-c. 104 B.C.), when he invoked the authority of the Chunqiu. "The great united scheme of the Chunqiu", he wrote, "is the everlasting warp that runs through heaven and earth and the principle that underlies to be di of the east. For the suggestion made much later to the Sui court that two "Sons of Heaven" could co-exist, see Sui shu 81, pp. 1827-28 (Peking: Zhonghua, 1973) and CHOC vol.

Proceeding to the Ming tang MR he conferred small par- cels of soil, bound fast with thatch, on his noblemen; and the ceremony was repeated in A.D. 17.28 The act had already been explained in one of Chu Shaosun's t'J/'&gt; (?10&gt;?30 B.C.) supple- mentary passages to the Shiji, and it is seen later in the Duduan X of Cai Yong E (133-92).29 It is traced to an emperor's own construction of his shrine to the soil, or the altar in that shrine, by drawing on earth of the "five colours", thus symbolizing that he was in possession of the five areas of the world. In conferring soil on noblemen, a careful choice was made of that of the colour that was appropriate to the region where the nobility was to be situated. Wang Mang was evidently determined that the message should be lost on no-one, stating explicitly that he was conferring the soil in his "capacity of lord of the ten thousand lands". References to a system of united rule are not so frequent in the decrees of Later Han. Following a solar eclipse and a number of natural disasters, a decree of 154 observed that those commanderies which had not been afflicted by such troubles should act as a store 24 HS 56.19a (p. 2523); see Gongyang zhuan 9+* (Shi san jing zhushu t ERZ ed.) 1.8b. 25 HS 6.12b (p. 173), HFHD vol.

The necessity for a system of rulership in order to ensure human survival in the face of natural threat and in order to prevent discord had long since been argued forcefully; e.g., see Liang Qixiong WX, Xunzi jianshi EifMW (Beijing: Guji, 1956) 9 ("Wang zhi E%IJ "), pp. lO9f.; Chen Qiyou W*M, Lu shi chunqiu jiaoshi MAaKW (Taipei: Hua sheng, 1988) 20 (8 "Shi jun lan 1wt5t "), pp. 1321f. 27 HS 99A.16a (p. 4065), HFHD vol.

As the legitimate rulers of man and the organizers of human effort within a single established framework, the emperors and their officials could expect that their statutes and ordinances would be applied universally to all inhabitants of the land. Such indeed had been the intention of Shang Yang fi (c.385-338 B.C.), in the institutions that he had set up in the kingdom of Qin.33 It may however be argued that the ideal of a system that would be oper- ated on equal terms universally had been vitiated even from the days of Qin onwards; for the marks of social distinction (jue X ) that were conferred by imperial grace and favour, carried with them provisions for favourable treatment and mitigation of punishments.34 It is open to question how far such privileges contradicted the con- cept of yitong, though it is suggested below that they could be exploited so as to add support to the idea. In the closing decades of the Han dynasty, we hear of one critic of the times, Wang Fu FEf (c.90-165), making a strong case for the impartial operation of the laws in the interests of social and administrative stability.35 30 HHS 7.7a (p. 299). 31 HHS 71.8b (p. 2309). 32 See CHOC vol.

How- ever strong the practical motives may have been, the adoption of a standardized script, which reached its highest point under Qin, paved the way towards the promotion of a commonly accepted literature and the highly respected teachings to be found therein. The whole process of imposing such a cultural unity is seen in the different stages whereby the study of those writings was handled, i.e., from the multiplicity of the pre-imperial schools of thought, to the adoption of the five texts for specially favoured treatment in public life (136 and 124 B.C.) and the moves to impose a standard, orthodox set of interpretations of the first and second centuries.36 These works, with their officially sponsored interpretation, carried with them the universal messages of the texts on li and the Zuo zhuan, to name but two. These included the recognition of certain basic qualities and ethical values that distinguished human beings from other crea- tures and called for conformity in a civilized community; they also comprised the rules for variations of behaviour within a single frame- work. Enactment of the idea of unified rule could not be achieved without compromise. Under the dispensation of the Qin emperors China had been divided into provincial units, whose governors were ap- pointed on individual terms and were subject to dismissal accord- ing to the same terms as other officials. This system had been introduced as a deliberate act of policy, in preference for the king- doms that were held on an hereditary basis; and as has been ob- served above the establishment of this "provincial" system had featured in the first Qin emperor's claim to have set up a system of united rule. A different situation prevailed at the start of the Han empire. The dynasty had been founded after some years of civil warfare and following Xiang Yu's abortive attempt to found an hegemony; and the founding fathers of Han may well have thought it wise to show that, despite their adoption of many of Qin's imperial institutions, they were in no sense the slavish imita- tors of that dynasty's ways. Qin may already have attracted criti- cism of a bitter sort, though it is possible that the strength of such protest was exaggerated by the historians of the later dynasties. If possible, while actual adopting many of its predecessor's methods of government, Han must be seen to be avoiding its excesses.

They adopted a compromise solution to the problem of how to impose effective government over a wide area, by setting up two types of administrative unit. For the inte- rior areas that could be kept immediately under their control, they retained the provincial system; but simultaneously they established hereditary kingdoms, made over to relatives of the emperor with the title of Zhuhouwang Mf3E , over to large outlying areas of the perimeter. This arrangement courted danger by inviting those of the kings who were of an ambitious nature to make a bid for indepen- dence. As might well have been foretold, before long such a division of authority gave rise to conflict, affording opportunity for separatist activities; and it took a number of decades before these threats to an unified system of administration would be scotched.37 In the meantime, however, the Han institution of kingdoms and its adoption of the Qin system of orders of aristocratic rank (jue) had acted partly as a cohesive force. While their inherent privi- leges and social distinctions displayed the hierarchical nature of the Chinese communities, they lent strength to a feeling of identity and membership of a single Chinese oikoumene. In a sense the practice of conferring the titles of hou R. with their attendant rights over land, or those of the lesser nineteen orders may be interpreted as a conscious measure designed to support social cohesion.38 Ever since the time of Shang Yang, the government of Qin had initiated steps towards a co-ordination of some of China's eco- nomic activities. The introduction of a regulated coinage and of the recognized dual system of weights and measures are obvious examples of policies which were maintained thereafter, on a uni- versal system throughout the empires. During Former Han some attempts were made to impose controls that would direct the work of the production and distribution of material goods by a central authority. While such measures were far from being wholly effec- tive, and gave rise to considerable controversy, they carried some weight in much later discussions, when they could be cited as a precedent.39 ` See CHOC vol. I, pp. 124, 139f., 473. 38 For further details of the conferment of these orders, see Nishijima Sadao flAC ChaQgoku kodai teikoku no keisei to kOzO : ; c'j jjW 8 tW*(Tokyo: TOkyo Daigaku shuppankai, 1961), pp. 55f.; and Michael Loewe, "The Orders of Aristocratic Rank of Han China" (T'oung Pao 48, 1-3 (1960), pp. 97-174). 39 See Michael Loewe, "Attempts at economic co-ordination during the Western</page><page sequence="15">20 MICHAEL LOEWE With whatever strength the ideal of yitong may have been held, the existence of alien peoples beyond the pale could not be denied. It may be suggested that, while the idea or ideal of unity drew strength from the attitudes expressed towards non-Chinese peoples, it was vitiated in part by Chinese practice; and that while the sense of hierarchies and centrality helped the Chinese to place others suitably within the unity, pride in cultural values prevented their complete acceptance on terms of equality. However much the Chinese may have wished to see themselves as being capable of governing mankind they were repeatedly faced by the stark evidence that such a claim could not be substantiated; for raids or attacks on the settled inhabitants of the farms and the cities could not be ignored. As the lives and property of registered members of the Chinese population were at stake, so too was the authority of the imperial government and its degree of efficacy, and it is hardly surprising that this problem gave rise to discussion throughout the days of the Han empire. The use at times of the same terms to describe revolts or uprisings in respect of both Chi- nese and non-Chinese need not necessarily signify that they were seen in the same light.40 Such discussions usually concerned the correct use of force and the most suitable way of doing so, with due attention to terrain and climate; but it is in connection with the major strategic impli- cations that a Chinese view of themselves emerges. In general two distinct types of policy were advocated; either that of retaining or that of abandoning the extended territories to which the imperial presence had been brought. Retention involved imposing hardship and expense on the Chinese people; withdrawal involved a loss of dignity and prestige. Of perhaps greater importance in intellectual terms, abandonment could also lead to a recognition of the author- ity of other, non-Chinese, leaders, as was seen in early days under the heqin -' arrangements; for these required China to render payment of material goods to non-Chinese groups, together some- times with the gift of a Chinese princess in marriage.41 Han dynasty", in S.R.

In later years discussions of policy also accompanied the ventures into the Western regions, of Central Asia, when Han policy varied between appeasement, defensive warfare, aggression or the establishment of colonies. In the resulting memorials and decrees there is little sense of a mis- sion of which the Chinese were conscious for imposing law and order on peoples not yet accustomed to such rules, bringing the benefits of a superior Chinese culture to those who lacked them, or acquiring benefits for the Chinese people from outside the pale. In one particular case at least few inhibitions prevented the prac- tice of deceit or violence against non-Chinese peoples and their leaders.43 The principles of li and the ethics preached by Kong Zi were apparently not always operative when dealing with unassimi- lated peoples; the question remains of whether the Chinese saw themselves as bound by these concepts only in internal dealings, without the obligation of extending them to other peoples. It does not seem that Han governments would necessarily claim an entitlement to possess or rule over all known territories; nor would they think it wise to attempt to occupy all the lands with which they came into contact. The Discourses on Salt and Iron, supposedly of 81 B.C., includes a speech made by one of the crit- ics of the government, which brings out the idea of the concentric zones; while the Son of Heaven stands at the centre, the intensity of imperial authority decreases, and the demands on the population are reduced as the far-lying areas succeed one another.44 Others who took part in that debate would perhaps have seen reason to question a policy that would countenance a limit to Chi- nese territory. The compromise that was achieved in at least three ways owed much to a sense of hierarchy; it was also the means of solving the complex problems that usually arise when a sovereign power assumes authority over newly won lands. These included the difficulty of securing the loyal support of the dispossessed leaders, whose familiarity with local conditions was far more intimate than Angeles: University of California Press, 1967), pp. lOf, 36f., and in CHOC vol. I, p. 386. 42 HS 48.16a (p. 2240). 43 See CICA, pp. 46, 49. 44 YTL 4 (16 "Di guang'ft*"), p. 114; Gale, p. 100.</page><page sequence="17">22 MICHAEL LOEWE that of the occupying forces; imposing a stable administration, at a time when there were few Chinese officials trained to face the local problems of the steppe, and few who could be spared for this task; and precluding the growth of a leadership that could mount sufficient force to challenge that of the central government of China. Han governments faced these problems by integrating some of the surrendered leaders of the Xiongnu and others within the so- cial structure of the empire. By nominating some of them as hou {ki, they conferred upon them the highest of the orders of aristo- cratic rank, which carried with it the privilege of raising taxation over a specified number of households within a particular area; they were also responsible for presenting an annual report on their areas, thus demonstrating their fealty. In this way a Chinese gov- ernment was in fact welcoming non-Chinese as participants in the imperial dispensation, at a recognised and honourable place in the social structure. While the foreign leaders surrendered control of their territories, they received confirmation of their authority from the imperial government; and the Chinese were willing to treat them as loyal subjects of their emperor.45 The second method of compromise is seen in the creation of special types of administrative unit to control the outlying territo- ries. These are seen in the shuguo JF- E, or dependent kingdoms, that were set up in the north-west and south-west, and in one case in the north-east.46 A Chinese commissioner and other officials were posted to such regions which, however, were not subject to the usual statutory obligations of tax and service that were demanded throughout other parts of the empire. In another form, units known as bao ? were established in other areas, and these likewise seem to have derived from the compromise that was necessary. The bao, or protectorate, may have included the administrative organs of the prefectures (xian a ) without subordination to a superior unit such as the commanderies (jun 9 ) of other parts of the empire.47 A third, and perhaps most extreme way of including non-Chinese with- in Han territory is seen in the enclaves of Xiongnu and other set- ` For examples of kings or other Xiongnu leaders who received marquisates (hou f ) on surrender, see HS 17, 1 lb et seq.

Integrated within the institutions of empire, there were now some groups whose way of life was in many ways different from their own, whose language may well have not been that of the Han peoples, whose racial origins may have been markedly different from those of the inhabitants of the interior, and who had yet to be exposed to the intellectual and moral training of which those in Chang'an were so proud. It must however be observed that these arrangements were by no means conspicuous. Clear as they were to the officials who suggested their adoption, they may well have escaped the attention of others, ex- cept in the areas where they were being put into effect. The foregoing considerations suggest a number of ways in which the Chinese view of themselves may have been subject to conflict. In the dilemma between seeing themselves as the victims of des- tiny or as masters of their own affairs they perhaps sought refuge in divination, to find guidance how to order their lives. If they saw a system or reason behind the workings of the universe, they had nonetheless to accept the conditions imposed by the order of nature. If they saw themselves as the passive recipients of her gifts, along with being the victims of her outrages, they thereby accepted a limitation on their ability to organise human effort. Such a mis- sion could in itself involve difficulties, in a choice between seek- ing material strength and safety for the whole community or promoting the greater benefits of cultural enrichment for its select members. Difficulties could also arise in a claim to be upholding the moral order and in fulfilling religious requirements. For the traditional precepts and rites had been framed at a time when intellectual ad- vance and political and social conditions were very different from what they had become by the Qin and Han dynasties. Were the Chinese of Han to see themselves as the heirs of the three ideal- ized periods of Xia, Shang and Zhou, who were obliged to follow their precedents without change, or were they entitled to compro- mise, or even introduce innovations, so as to meet contemporary circumstances? Thus while the principles of the sages must be re- garded as permanent, their application must necessarily be open to 48 CHOC vol. I, pp. 404-05.</page><page sequence="19">24 MICHAEL LOEWE change; arguments about such change could arise easily enough.49 Pride in the unity, integrity and self-sufficiently of empire, a hope of devotion to civil and cultural aims, and a fiction that re- course to armed force should not be necessary were subject to compromise in the course of foreign relations. Two methods could be seen with which to woo the friendship of some of the peoples of Central Asia, scorned for their inability to live up to the cul- tural standards of the empire; either they could be won by a dis- play of a superior style of living, seen in material forms; or they could be taught the value of appreciating and practising moral prin- ciples; the choice could give rise to controversy.50 Should it be determined that military means were necessary to uphold the dig- nity of the emperor, secure the safety of the Chinese realm or safe- guard the pursuit of a civilized way of life, it would be necessary to call up men as servicemen, to man the permanent defence lines and to provide the necessary expenses; such an imposition of bur- dens on the individual could run counter to an ideal of government that sought to reduce such imposts to a minimum.51 Other argu- ments concerned the value of importing goods from outside China, some seeing these as necessities for the peace of the realm, others as the dispensable baubles of luxury.52 Attention has been drawn above to the major divergences that were apparent in China at the start of the imperial period and which were seemingly sufficient to obviate a meaningful idea of unity. But despite the manifest failure of the last decades of the Han dynasty to live up to the ideals of the Confucian ethic,53 a major 49 See the question raised by Wudi and Dong Zhongshu's reply (HS 56.13b et seq. (pp. 2513f.); for discussion of the principle in Later Han, see Zhongchang Tong's fAC essay "Sunyi' e , in HHS 49.15a (pp. 1650f). A particular case, which involved practical decisions, concerned the question of how long it was proper and justifiable to maintain the expensive offerings and services at shrines dedicated to some of the more remote ancestors of some of the emper- ors; see Michael Loewe, "The Imperial Tombs of the Former Han Dynasty and their Shrines" (T'oung Pao 78 (1992), pp. 302f.; rpt. in Divination, Mythology and Monarchy in Han China, chapter 13).

A sense of unity had been asserted; the Chinese could see themselves as members of a single political entity, and even in the dynastic divisions of the next few centuries, few statesmen or officials would have thought in terms of an hegemony. The state cults centered on heaven rather than on a multiplicity of divine powers; men of learning were accustomed to accept the need to conform with the approved interpretation of ancient texts; there was developing a single attitude towards China's past, drawn ei- ther from mythology or from history. Scholars and teachers saw themselves as in duty bound to transmit the teachings of the Con- fucian masters and their trust to li; officials saw their duty as serv- ing the acknowledged Son of Heaven. Such was the debt owed to Han Confucianism, which allowed the Chinese to see themselves as part of the universal order, as followers of the precepts of Confucius and as participant members of the heaven blest order of empire. The question remains of how far the Chinese of the early em- pires had consciously formulated a concept of China as a unity in which all elements combined to create a single whole. Certainly it is possible to isolate certain significant elements, e.g. of religious duties, institutional practices or social relationships that were al- ready essential to any attempt to organise mankind under a single aegis. Some of these elements, that would indeed contribute to- wards the formation of a unity both at that time and later, were already some centuries old, as seen in the task of transmitting the arts and ways of cultured living of the sage kings; the force of the tradition of kingship ascribed to Zhou; and the respect paid to the moral values and precepts of the recognized masters. The retention and re-inforcement of these and other elements in the early em- pires contributed in no small way to the survival of a sense of unity after Han, in a land rent by dynastic discord, subject to the impact of a foreign faith and open to ethnic admixture on a new scale.
