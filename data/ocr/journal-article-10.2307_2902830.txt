<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Character of God: Recovering the Lost Literary Power of American Protes- tantism. By Thomas E. Jenkins. New York: Oxford Univ. Press. 1997. x, 272 pp. $45.00. Jenkins's elegant, succinct study sheds light on a theme infrequently treated these days: depictions of God in American literature. Evaluating the thought of "cosmopolitan theologians" from the mid-ninteenth century through the 1960s, Jenkins observes that as notions of God became increasingly vague,</page><page sequence="2">382 American Literature theological writing became dry and dull. Torn between two established aesthetic styles - sentimental/neoclassical and romantic - liberal theologians generally favored the former, while conservatives opted for the latter. Ironi- cally, it is modern conservatives who now eschew their historical links to romanticism, just as neoclassical theologians once ignored the audience appeal of an anthropomorphic God. The angry Old Testament God of the Puritans was unpopular by the 1850s, when sentimental theologian-writers (Channing, Park, the Hodges, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Henry Ward Beecher) served up a serene and neutral God. Bushnell's dissenting vision of a bloodthirsty avenger remained a mi- nority view, which receives deserved attention here in the careers of lesser lights such as Shedd, Thornwell, Griffin, and Baird. The Social Gospel of Walter Rauschenbusch as well as its opponents, led by Reinhold Niebuhr and J. Gresham Machen, are well treated. Jenkins contends that while liberal Protestantism represents a twentieth- century innovation, its God was still a neoclassical being, whether deployed by social gospelers or by champions of neoorthodoxy. If God and Jesus are credited with being serene, unchanging idealists, then what more is there for theologians to say? Even fundamentalists relied upon this image of an orderly methodical God, although divinity's plans in their view included the earthly catastrophes basic to dispensational theology. As for ordinary Protestant conservatives, it was hard to describe or love this amorphous, predictable God. Liberal modernists like Theodore Munger, who wanted Americans to tran- scend the Christian family unit for a larger humanitarian vision, were in the minority. Similarly, Amos Wilder argued, presumably to a small audience, that " [t] he cross of Christ should be a fountain of health and not of morbidity. " Jenkins suggests that we now deserve images of an emotionally complex God to match the complexity of the post-Darwinian world. American interest in Protestantism has declined in the present century, perhaps due to the decline of theological authority overall as much as to liberals' wide-eyed optimism, untarnished by two world wars, atomic bomb- ings, and race riots. Jenkins concludes with a judicious assessment of the limitations of political theology in the careers of Carl Henry, Harvey Cox, and Martin Luther King Jr. King represents an interesting synthesis of his two idols, Rauschenbusch and Niebuhr, while Cox's lightweight liberalism sounds absurd at times. Can Americans really do without the notion of a God of Thunder? By limit- ing the book to cosmopolitan elites, Jenkins does not consider what average believers desired in their notion of God, yet the issue remains an important one for those who study the intersections between highbrow and lowbrow cul- ture. Furthermore, there is no hint of the psychological dynamics underlying the human desire to be punished or rewarded by an omnipotent being.
