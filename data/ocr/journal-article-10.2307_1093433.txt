<plain_text><page sequence="1">FUNDAMENTALISM IN CONTRACT Now that some of the dust has settled, it is proposed to attempt to evaluate the impact of the House of Lords decision in Suisse Atlantique 1 both from the point of view of the " little man " hope- lessly at odds with the standardised contracts of the big legions and also from the point of view of " the ordinary law of contract," which, according to revanchist academic opinion, has been vindi- cated in full measure. Undoubtedly one likely result is greater emphasis in the future on the rules surrounding breach of contract as opposed to those rules dealing with formation. Williston noted that English, and, to a lesser extent, American courts have groped somewhat uncertainly for fundamental principles concerning breach of contract and its effects.2 Suisse Atlantique has helped to clarify some of the issues involved in this area. To review the facts briefly,3 the appellants, who had been unsuc- cessful in their claim for damages over and above the demurrage payments provided for in their two years' consecutive charter for the carriage of coal from the United States to ports in Europe, appealed to the House of Lords. In so doing they fell back upon a supplementary case, the gravamen of which was that the respon- dents (the charterers) were precluded from relying solely on the demurrage clause in the charterparty because by deliberately per- forming fewer voyages than could ordinarily have been accomplished they were guilty of a fundamental breach or deviation which, as a matter of law, incapacitated them from relying on the clause. The decision itself went off on comparatively narrow grounds, namely, that no contractual term, express or implied, governed the number of voyages, that the demurrage clause in question was not an exemption clause stricto sensu and that, in any case, the appel- lants had not sailed the ship away, i.e., they had affirmed the charter and its terms on the assumption that the breach was fundamental. Although their Lordships were not therefore called upon to apply the principles which they discussed to the instant case, the views expressed are of broad interest on a number of general contractual questions such as the fundamental term itself, the relationship between breach of such a term and fundamental breach, the nature of exemption clauses and their availability where a breach has occurred, the effect of breach and the relevance of "deliberateness." 1 [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944; [1966] 2 All E.R. 61; [1967] A.C. 361, H.L. 2 Williston on Contract, 2nd ed., s. 895. 3 See Treitel (1966) 29 M.L.R. 546. 531</page><page sequence="2">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW FUNDAMENTAL TERM Two of their Lordships 4 were clearly inclined to perpetuate the concept of the fundamental term defined as a " stipulation which the parties have agreed either expressly or by necessary implication or which the general law regards as a condition which goes to the root of the contract so that any breach of that term may at once and without further reference to the facts and circumstances be regarded by the innocent party as a fundamental breach." 5 The remaining judgments omitted discussion of the fundamental term, preferring a discussion of fundamental breach itself, although Lord Wilberforce treated fundamental breach as a genus comprising two types of breach, viz., (i) breach in the form of performance " totally different " from that which the contract envisaged, and (ii) breach more serious in nature than one attracting merely a right to damages.6 There is much to be said in favour of jettisoning the concept of the fundamental term from our law. Whatever it is- ' something . . . narrower than a condition," 7 the " core " of the contract, something identificatory 8 or definitive 9 of the subject- matter-the doctrine has not escaped criticism.10 A seemingly neat classification of terms into condition, warranty, warranty ex post facto and fundamental term may, as a conceptual framework, help the expositor of law, but as Lord Devlin points out in a recent article of great interest,"1 lawyers have tended to fasten upon certain identifiable markings from previous cases-" once a con- dition always a condition." Although Lord Devlin endorses the recent concentration upon breach and calls for a synthesis which would unite differing forms of discharge such as breach and frustra- tion, he does give us some further conceptualism in " the funda- mental term " (constituting the hard core of the contract) and " a fundamental term " (affecting the substance of the adventure). One can only echo the recent call for a more practical level of discussion in place of the " vague and obscure conceptualism of the present time." 12 Conditions as described by an imposing array of judicial synonyms-" foundation," " substratum," " essence " and " root " are typical-are difficult to accommodate alongside 4 Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Upjohn. 5 Per Lord Upjohn [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944 at p. 979. 6 [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944 at p. 986. 7 Per Devlin J. in Smeaton Hanscomb v.

Admit- tedly, the exercise has been undertaken as a mode of countering the increasing use of exemption clauses in ominously wide terms but in attempting to distinguish between the immutable, fundamental obligation (non-excludable) and the variable, fundamental obliga- tion which is subsidiary to the main core without ranking as a warranty (excludable) 13 we have been driven into the type of philosophical inquiry concerning essence and attributes which has disfigured the law relating to mistake. Perhaps over-enthusiastic application of the idea to strike at defects which might be considered qualitative had done much to weaken it. In Charterhouse Credit Co. v. Tolly,14 the car was capable of locomotion but the defective back axle rendered it unroadworthy, thereby constituting a funda- mental breach. Likewise in Yeoman Credit Ltd. v. Apps,15 the " congeries of defects " 16 militated against the fundamental obliga- tion, namely, to supply a car which could be used on the roads. Recognising that the parties are at liberty to elevate a qualitative feature to something which forms the basis of the contract, or that the surrounding circumstances indicate such an intention, e.g., when an unroadworthy car is hired for a day, there were signs that further progress along the lines indicated by these two cases would have brought the concept perilously close to section 14 (1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893. Fortunately doubt was expressed whether the right result had been reached on the facts of the former case. Whilst, as Lord Devlin agrees,17 there are terms of which it can be predicated in advance that breach of them necessarily frustrates the purpose of the contract, Suisse Atlantique continues a trend manifested in Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co. v. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha 18 whereby the courts seem to be moving away from a system of a priori categorisation of terms in favour of a more flexible " wait and see" attitude. Lord Devlin confirms the scepticism of those who doubted the post hoc propter hoc approach whereby certain results are supposed to flow automatically from previously categorised terms. He points out that "A judge does not make up his mind exactly what the term means before he turns to consider the breach." 19 The main objection to the fundamental term is that it is superfluous in that " chalk and cheese " dilemmas 1i L.

One hesitates to assert that the quietus has been administered to any doctrine which has received its imprimatur from Lord Denning, but it would now appear that there is no rule of law that a party who commits a fundamental breach cannot rely on the provisions of an exemption clause drawn in his favour. Lord Reid felt unable to support such a doctrine, first, on the ground that judicial creativity based upon public policy ought to be sparingly exercised (a view which is in line with the judicial disinclination to adjudicate upon canons of reasonableness in contract). No doubt his Lordship felt that in recent years there has been a preference for legislative solutions to the problems inherent in a modern, mixed economy subject to autarchic pressures, such as that of economic inequality.20 Secondly, the indiscriminate nature of the legal rule which failed to distinguish between cases of inequality and cases where the parties have roughly equal bargaining strength, together with the complexity of a problem affecting millions of people, were factors influencing his Lordship. Now that a Working Party under the Law Commission is looking into the problem of exemption clauses we may expect some specific proposals, but apart from this the consumer is not left entirely defenceless since, despite the demotion of the " rule " to one of construction, there is still considerable room for manoeuvre.21 It is noteworthy that many of the cases considered by the House of Lords proved to be consonant with a rule of construction which is based on the intention of the parties. First, by applying the contra proferentem rule it may be possible to hold that a particular clause or term, considered in isolation, is inapplicable in the situation which has occurred. In Hollins v. Davy (J.), Sachs J., confronted with the word " misdelivery," was prepared to distinguish between "deliberate deliveries to a wrong person and a misdelivery by mistake or inadvertence." 21a To some extent overlapping with this, the main purpose rule, when applied, may enable an exceptions clause to be harmonised with the main object of the contract. The following situations may appear. First, an exemption clause of wide effect may be explicitly reconcilable with the main purpose. Thus in Frenkel v. Mac- Anidrews 22 the resources of the English language were adequate to validate a deviation clause which allowed the vessel " to touch at 20 One wonders if the withdrawal of House of Lords support may stimulate legislation, e.g., Adams v. Naylor and the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. 21 See 29 M.L.R. 546 at p. 551. 21a [1963] 1 Q.B. 844 at 856, adopting Devlin J.'s distinction in Alexander v. Railway Executive [1951] 2 K.B. 882. 22 [1929] A.C. 545, at p. 564. In Morris v. C. W. Martin t Sons Ltd. [19651 2 All E.R. 725 at p. 734, Lord Denning M.R. gave an exemption clause a strict construction. Thus, " goods belonging to customers " did not include goods belonging to customers of the customer, whilst " loss or damage to the goods during processing" did not include theft by a servant of the cleaners which occurred before or after processing. 534 VOL. 30</page><page sequence="5">FUNDAMENTALISM IN CONTRACT any ports whatsoever, although they may be outside the route, without it being considered a deviation." Whilst such a clause permits of some deviation, presumably a call at Hong Kong on a voyage between Calais and Dover could hardly be termed a "deviation " at all. In G. H. Renton v. Palmyra Trading Cor- poration,23 it was held that delivery at Hamburg was permissible under the terms of a strike clause which was not repugnant to the main object. Jenkins L.J., in the Court of Appeal,24 had adverted to the distinction " between a power given to one of the parties which, if construed literally, would in effect enable that party to nullify the contract at will, and a special provision stating what the rights and obligations of the parties are to be in the event of obstacles beyond the control of either arising to prevent or impede the performance of the contract in accordance with its primary terms." Both of these cases show that it is not always necessary to consider every exemption clause as being pro tanto inconsistent with the primary obligation-the effect may be to delimit the ambit of the contract. Professor K. W. Wedderburn 25 has suggested the intriguing possibility that draftsmen might shrink the purpose of the contract to minute proportions so that a breach becomes difficult to establish, but the courts have been able in a few cases to arrive at such a result by construing two or more terms and arriving at a composite view of the contractual scope. Secondly, where there is, prima facie, incompatibility between the main purpose and the exemption clause, the latter will be construed so as to harmonise with and effectuate the main object, whether this involves limiting the meaning of the exceptions clause, or, in extreme cases, rejecting the clause. In Leduc v. Ward,26 a deviation clause granting "liberty to call at any ports in any order " was held inapt to cover a deviation to Glasgow in relation to a voyage from Fiume to Dunkirk, because " the ports must be ports substantially on the course of the voyage." Here, as in the leading case of Glynn v. Margetson &amp;S Co.,27 the construction of the contract determines the " four corners" of the contract outside which the exceptions clause has no effect. The scope of the clause is cut down so as to subordinate it to the main purpose. Finally, bearing in mind that the court cannot construct (as opposed to construe) a contract,28 how is the antinomy to be resolved where neither of the two foregoing techniques is applied? Since a contract must concern something in re or in spe, could the contract be construed as having the latter as subject-matter, i.e., 23 [1957] A.C. 149. 24 [19561 1 Q.B. 462, at p. 502. 25 [1957] C.L.J. 17 at p. 20; B.

One would hope, to digress, that proposals will be forthcoming to modify the rules concerning notice of contractual terms which frequently operate to the disadvantage of the weaker, contracting party. Notice aside, it is submitted that the courts should be extremely reluctant to find, in such cases, that one of the parties has entered into what Lord Justice Diplock has termed an " if " contract, the unilateral contract of French law, which binds one party without any engage- ment being made on the part of the other party (Art. 1103, Code Civile). To find so would violate the expectations of fair-minded, reasonable persons who buy things or services rather than the chance of things or services. The sanction of nullity, whether arising from uncertainty or lack of consideration, is something which, it is hoped, will temper the enthusiasm of the over- ambitious draftsman anxious to display his mastery of the " resour- ces of the English language." Lord Wilberforce adverted to this possibility in Suisse Atlantique, as has Lord Devlin in his recent article when dealing with exemptive provisions which purport to " annihilate " the promise.29 THE EFFECT OF FUNDAMENTAL BREACH AND EXEMPTION CLAUSES Before discussing its effect it is necessary to say something of fundamental breach itself, a term which, according to Lord Hodson, is of comparatively recent origin and which seems to have attained " some mystical meaning in the law of contract." 30 To those who cling to the fundamental term it is natural that breach of such a term must necessarily be fundamental, although no one would claim that breach of a fundamental term and fundamental breach are coterminous. Leaving aside this a priori class, there is authority for the view that fundamental breach is a breach (or an event consequent thereon) which destroys the basis of the contract in the way that frustration does. It is, as Diplock L.J. puts it, "a total failure by one party to perform a contract of the kind entered into." 31 The court, having ascertained the contractual intention of the parties, must look at the events resulting from the breach to see if they deprive the party not in default of sub- stantially the whole benefit which it was intended he should obtain. Article 10 of the Uniform Law on International Sales Bill (which will, if enacted, have the force of law in this country, subject, how- ever, to the choice of parties) adopts what might loosely be termed the frustration view or the " contract of a different kind " view when it states that " a breach of contract shall be regarded as fundamental wherever the party in breach knew, or ought to have 29 [1966] C.L.J. 192 at p. 212. 30 [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944 at p. 968. 31 Hardwicke Game Farm v.

On the other hand, to Lord Reid, fundamental breach is the " well-known type of breach " entitling the innocent party to repudiate his own obligations.2 The circu- larity in this definition, also apparent in the definitions of total breach given by Corbin 83 and the Restatement,84 must be broken, as it is, for example, in the latter, by the requirement that such a breach must constitute a " material failure of performance." 35 At this stage no one can safely predict which view will prevail, since each reflects basically different attitudes. To turn to the effect of fundamental breach on the contract, including any exemption clause which it may contain (assuming that such a clause has survived the application of the main purpose rule), it is clear that such a breach, whilst it may share a bed with frustration, differs in that, unlike the latter, its effect on the contract is dependent upon the responses of the party not in default. In Suisse Atlantique there was no discharge because the appellant had affirmed the charterparty with the result that the contract continued alive, including the demurrage clause, quite apart from the preliminary questions as to whether the demurrage clause was an exemption clause at all and whether the breach in question was fundamental. One of the chief drawbacks of the fundamental term was the way in which it complicated the law relating to breach of contract. Thus, to revert to Tolly again, it will be recollected that the defendant in that case did not reject the car, i.e., on the facts he had approbated the contract. Had he, by so doing, approbated the whole contract, including the exemption clause? The Court of Appeal, with some hesitation, felt impelled to say that there could be affirmation less the exemption clause. Such a view follows naturally from acceptance as a matter of law of a supposed rule that a party who commits a fundamental breach cannot rely on such clauses-indeed, if this were so it matters little whether the injured party accepts the repudiation or waives it.36 Any doubt on this score is removed by Suisse Atlantique, which restores the law to the position expressed with typical pungency by Lord Atkin 82 [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944 at p. 958. 33 Contracts, s. 946. &amp;4 Contracts, s. 313. 85 Ibid. s. 274. American and Scots law show a more realistic emphasis upon the " materiality " of the breach than English law. 86 For example, see the obiter dictum of Lord Denning M.R. in U.G.S. Finance Ltd. v. National Bank of Greece [1964] L1.L.Rep. 446 at p. 450-" The doctrine does not depend on the customer electing to disaffirm the contract," following the Tolly case. His Lordship felt that whilst a time-bar clause might rank as an exemption clause " when it exempts a party from liability," this was not the case here (claim for overdue interest on Greek bonds), nor had there been a fundamental breach. Cf. the orthodox position d la Hain taken by Pearson L.J. (p. 454) and Harman L.J. (p. 458). SEPT. 1967 537</page><page sequence="8">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW in Hain Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Tate &amp; Lyle Ltd.37 when he dis- couraged language suggesting that deviation " displaces " the contract, or, alternatively, the exemption clause. The correct view is that deviation constitutes a breach going to the root of the contract which enables the innocent party to declare that he is no longer bound by its terms. Breach by deviation " does not automatically cancel the express contract, otherwise the shipowner by his own wrong can get rid of his own contract. Nor does it affect alone merely the exceptions clause. This would make those clauses alone subject to a condition of no deviation. . . ." Lord Atkin confined his remarks to contracts of carriage by sea, in which the dangers of deviation had long been recognised, not least being the possibility that marine insurances might be invalidated. Both Lords Maugham and Wright referred to the " fundamental con- dition " that, in the absence of express liberties, the ship should proceed by the ordinary and customary route. If, as seems likely, this view represents the " ordinary law of contract," it was certainly applied in Chandris v. Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. Inc.,38 where the motion that the contract had been displaced by the loading of an unlawful cargo of turpentine was dispelled-the contract is not discharged " unless there is either a rescission of it or evidence from which a new contract can be inferred." Lord Reid was clear that once acceptance of fundamental breach occurs the " whole contract has ceased to exist." 39 This unequi- vocal assertion is at variance with the more usual, elliptical state- ment that the injured party may treat the contract as ended which in effect draws a distinction between the contract and a party's obligation of further performance thereunder. It is the latter which is discharged and not the former. This reluctance to discuss " discharge of contract " is conspicuous in Roman law, which, apart from the lex commissioria in enptio venditio, omitted major discussion of breach as a form of solutio.40 Modern continental systems have not managed so well and have been constrained to admit of some form of rescission. Article 1184 of the Code Civile provides an implied resolutive condition in synallagmatic contracts 37 [1936] 2 All E.R. 597 at p. 601. The crucial nature of the innocent party's election is typified in White &amp; Carter (Councils) Ltd. v. McGregor [1962] A.C. 413. Lord Reid stressed that thep contract remains in full effect if the innocent party chooses to disregard or refuses to accept the repudiation of the contract: cf. Cunard S.S. Co. Ltd. v. Buerger [1927] A.C. 1, where Lord Sumner (p. 8), dealing with the overcarriage of goods, said that this would, apart from special provisions in the bill of lading, "constitute a fundamental departure from the course of the agreed transit, after which such a clause of exceptions utould cease to apply " (italics mine). 38 [1951] 1 K.B. 240: if there has been an election to affirm the whole contract, there cannot be a further option to rescind in part (p. 250). 89 [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944 at p. 958. 40 Charles Szladits, " Discharge of Contract by Breach in Civil Law," American Journal of Comparatire Latc, Vol. 2, p. 334 et seq. 538 VOL. 30</page><page sequence="9">FUNDAMENTALISM IN CONTRACT in the event of non-performance, with the qualification that rescis- sion is a judicial act. Swiss law 41 admits of a limited degree of extra-judicial rescission attended by a surprising degree of forma- lism, the purpose of which is to bring home to the contract-breaker that the contract is about to end. American law suffers the same doubts as English law in this respect. The Restatement, apropos total breach, states that " remedial rights provided by law are substituted by the injured party." 42 At the practical level, doubts have arisen as to the operation of secondary, contractual provisions such as arbitration clauses, liquidated damages clauses and so forth. To take the dilemma posed in Heyman v. Darwins Ltd.,43 if the repudiation of the contract (including an arbitration clause) is accepted by the party not in default so as to terminate the contract, then is not the arbitration provision useless? To avoid such a result, Lords Macmillan and Porter drew a distinction between termination of contract and the right of one party to treat the contract as ended, discussed above. Lord Macmillan considered that the contract continues notwithstanding an accepted repudiation because the contract provides the measure of damages, whilst the guilty party does not repudiate the contract but only his own obligations thereunder. Lord Wright suggested that the arbitration clause is " collateral to the substantial stipulations of the contract " and being of purely procedural and ancillary effect is unaffected by an accepted repudiation.44 A recent example of the distinction is Lord Justice Diplock's division of contractual obligations into primary obligations (discharged by performance) and secondary obligations (arising upon non-performance of primary obligations by one of the parties).45 Such a division allows of termination of primary obligations in the event of an accepted repudiation, whilst admitting of the continuance of collateral or secondary obligations, e.g., arbitration.46 Where do exemption clauses fit into such a scheme of things? Lord Reid was clear that an accepted repudia- tion disables the contract-breaker from enforcing the exemption clause. Such a view has the merit of simplicity in that it treats the contract as an entity, or, perhaps, at a more modest level, views the matter from the familiar standpoint of dependency of promises, i.e., a party who commits a fundamental breach cannot enforce a promise by the other party to forgo rights which would otherwise arise. But, as Lord Reid himself warned, this is too simple. 41 Art. 167, Riicktritt, limited to cases where the debtor is in mora; Art. 97, dealing with non-performance of a permanent character, gives only damages. 42 Contracts, p. 313.

Here one might add a few words to Mr. Treitel's treatment of this point, when he deals with the problem of whether the right to repudiate can itself be excluded by an appro- priate clause.47 Dr. Coote 48 has brought out the essential difference between those clauses which delimit the scope of the contractual promise and those which provide shields to accrued rights. If the court, by applying the rule in Glynn v. Margetson, manages to reconcile the clause with the primary object of the contract (as a last resort, pruning it), then one has a composite determination of contractual scope in which it becomes pointless to speak of the effect of the exemption clause considered per se. For example, assuming a deviation clause to rank as an exemption clause, if damages and rescission are claimed because of a deviation autho- rised by the clause (i.e., construing the contract as a whole), it is misleading to say that the right to repudiate (or claim damages) has been excluded. The "right" to repudiate for breach of contract can only arise upon breach and here there has been none; an explanation of the self-evident! If, however, the exemption clause is treated apart from the primary obligations in the contract (and the undesirability of this has been pointed out), then its effect is a straight question of construction; a clause limiting or agreeing damages could only with difficulty be said to affect rescission. In this respect an exemption clause would receive the same treatment as other secondary provisions, e.g., time-limits upon claims and so forth. One must admit that Suisse Atlantique does create difficulty if one views the effect of the breach on the contract when such breach is accepted by the party not in default; the merit of the main purpose approach is that it starts from the other end and considers the extent to which the exemption clause can be recon- ciled with the scope of the primary obligation. The demurrage clause in Suisse Atlantique was held to be an agreed damages clause and not a clause excluding or limiting damages.49 This finding alone sufficed to dispose of the appeal, but Lord Upjohn went on to say that an exemption clause is " inserted for the purpose only of protecting one contracting party from the legal consequences of other express terms of the contract or from terms which would otherwise be implied by law or from the terms of the contract regarded as a whole " (my italics). Such a definition supports that view which sees such a clause as a shield to accrued rights. It does, however, draw attention to the " one-sided " characteristic of such clauses, a feature which occasioned some 47 29 M.L.R. 546 at pp. 552-553. 48 Exemption Clauses. 49 Immaterial that the demurrage payments amounted to considerably less than the net loss. 50 [1966] 2 W.L.R. 944 at p. 977. 540 VOL. 30</page><page sequence="11">FUNDAMENTALISM IN CONTRACT difficulty in Woolf v. Collis Removal Services,5" where the arbitra- tion clause required the customer as opposed to the carrier to go to arbitration. Asquith L.J., who read the court's judgment, ruled that the one-sided nature of the arbitration clause did not make it an exceptions clause because arbitration is in essence "&lt; mere machinery," even if it be one-sided machinery, and was, in any event, distinguishable from exceptions clauses proper in that these do not survive an accepted repudiation. Lord Devlin suggests a three-fold classification of exemption clauses into (i) " exceptions" providing for unexpected events outside the control of the parties, e.g., force majeure, (ii) 6" exclusions " which qualify obligations falling upon a party under the contract, and (iii) " ancillary benefits " comprising liberties, benefits and other advantages of an ancillary nature which a party may seek to obtain under the contract, e.g., deviation clauses and clauses dealing with time-limits upon claims.52 Such a division, no doubt drawn from the maritime law of carriage and insurance, reflects Lord Devlin's preference for fault (and the idea of operative causes) as the basis of contract. One may doubt whether the courts can draw such distinctions outside maritime law in the absence of such clearly established usages. To do so would involve passing value judgments in new areas of contract. DELIBERATENESS AND FAULT Exemption clauses, aside from the manner in which they have attracted attention to the fundamental term and fundamental breach, have produced another " rule" in that a breach of a fundamental nature is wilful and deliberate. In Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd. v. Rambler Cycle Co., Lord Denning referred to the " self-same distinction " which " runs through all the cases where a fundamental breach has disentitled a party from relying on an exemption clause. In each of them there will be found a breach which evinces a deliberate disregard of his bounden obligations." 5s Much of the judicial emphasis on negligence in breach of contract has been a by-product of those cases in which the contra proferentem rule has been employed in order to determine the extent of a party's liability, whether contractual or imposed by common law. Thus a common carrier is subject to a two-tier duty-strict liability 51 [1948] 1 K.B. 11, C.A. at p. 17. The layman, impatient of the allusive language of the lawyer, would like the " supplier" to state in simple terms exactly what it is that he is undertaking to provide-this occurred to Sellers L.J., dissenting, in John Carter (Fine Worsteds) Ltd. v. Hanson Haulage [1965] 2 W.L.R. 553 at p. 565, when, having translated the contentions into positive prose, he went on to doubt " if any carrier would advance such a contract so boldly stated and I doubt still more whether any prospective consigner would accept it." Lack of notice of onerous terms is often as great a problem as the terms themselves. 52 [1966] C.L.J. 192 at p. 208. 53 [1959] A.C. 576 at p. 588. 541 SEPT. 1967</page><page sequence="12">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW (with exceptions) and negligence so that the courts, where ambi- guity existed, could construe the exemptive provision in the contract as applicable solely to the strict liability. Where no such strict liability exists, for example, the obligations of a laundry in the matter of returning laundered goods, or the obligation of a private carrier, an exemptive clause will be construed so as to extend to that head of damage, viz., negligence, " because it would otherwise lack subject matter." 54 Having conceded a degree of validity to exemptive provisions in relation to negligence, it was perhaps natural that the courts would then put deliberate wrongdoing beyond the pale of those provisions. Thus the vanman who leaves his van unattended for one hour whilst goods are stolen from it,55 the discontented storeman who knocks out the bung of a barrel so that orange juice escapes from it,56 and the carrier who delivers goods to a consignee who fails to produce the bill of lading 57 all alike exemplify this deliberate disregard of bounden obligations. The appellants in Suisse Atlantique claimed that the element of wilfulness exhibited by the respondents (i.e., deliberately performing fewer voyages) lent to the breach a fundamental character. The view that funda- mental breaches are invariably deliberate was rejected. Lord Wilberforce was clear that the deliberate character of the breach could not, of itself, attract the label " fundamental," although he, in common with most of the House of Lords, was prepared to concede that wilfulness might well be relevant in colouring a breach so as to give it repudiatory proportions.58 It is submitted, with respect, that this refusal to compartmentalise breach into deliberate, reckless and negligent categories is welcome. Lord Denning was not prepared to rule out the possibility that negligence may well go to the root of the contract,59 a view which Professor A. G. Guest has taken up, and upon which he does not share Lord 54 Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd. [1945] 1 K.B. 189 at p. 192, per Lord Greene M.R. 55 Bontex Knitting Works v.

A recent example is Garnham, Harris &amp; Eltott Ltd. v. Alfred Ellis (Transport) Ltd. [1967] 1 W.L.R. 940, where Paull J. held that a carrier was liable for the loss of goods which had been entrusted to a man who gave the name of a non- existent firm. Although the claim was out of time under the Road Haulage Conditions of Carriage (which included subcontractors in the term contractor), it was held that the oral contract envisaged personal performance in view of the " gold of thieves " (copper wire) which was to be carried and that in any case the manner of subcontracting, viz., without checking on the suitability of the subcontractor " amounted to a deliberate interference without justifica- tion, in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the plaintiff " (p. 948): cf. the Carter case (note 51 supra) where the act of the driver, whatever its effect as regards vicarious liability, did not amount to a deliberate breach of the contract imputable to the contracting party personally, although the latter's negligence in eligendo a driver without checking his suitability was such a personal breach of contract albeit not fundamental. 58 [1966] 1 W.L.R. 944 at p. 990. 59 In Spurling (J.) v. Bradshaw, supra. 542 VOL. 30</page><page sequence="13">FUNDAMENTALISM IN CONTRACT Denning's doubts.60 In any case, the main purpose rule, with its corollary, the " four corners rule," is adequate to deal with the problems posed by each exemption clause. Many cases of deliberate conduct have been and are likely to be held to be outside the corners of the contract, so that it is tempting to say, as a matter of law, that deliberate breaches are necessarily fundamental-this is to seize on a factor comnion to a number of cases and to erect it into a rule. In Quinn v. Burch Brothers (Builders) Ltd.,6' sub- contractors claimed that the main contractors had, in breach of contract, failed to supply proper step-ladders and that they were entitled to damages, despite their own contributory negligence. Dealing with the submission that there had been a negligent breach of contract by the contractors, Paull J. declared-" I confess that I do not myself understand the phrase 'a negligent breach of contract.' Such a phrase seems to import that liability in contract depends on the manner of the breach. I cannot think that in contract it matters whether the breach is brought about deliberately or negligently or per incuriam." 62 Lord Wright's statement 63 in Joseph Constantine Steamship Ltd. v. Imperial Smelting Cor- poration Ltd., that a contract absolute in terms is not necessarily absolute in effect, only qualifies the rule as to absolute contracts to the extent that the presumed intention of the parties is para- mount. There is an absolute duty to perform your contractual obligation; by contrast, the duty not to cause loss by negligence has been properly criticised as an example of " circular " or meaningless " reference and can be stated without reference to "duty " at all.64 In this conflict between the autonomic and heteronomic view of contract pointed out by the late Professor J. L. Montrose,65 Lord Devlin has recently welcomed a move to the latter view.66 In pursuance of a synthesis between tort and contract, he brings powerful advocacy to the adoption of fault (the exercise of due diligence and the concept of effective causes) rather than risk as the basis of English contract. This is in line with Lord Radcliffe's views concerning the basis of frustration, namely, that the parties to the contract should be left in peace and recourse had to " the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice " and who is " the court itself." 67 To extend " an objective rule of the law of contract " 68 to breach itself would mark a radical 60 26 M.L.R. 301-303. 61 [1963] 3 All E.R. 801, affirmed [1966] 2 All E.R. 283, C.A., mainly on the ground that the breach did not cause the accident but merely provided the plaintiff with the opportunity to injure himself. 62 [19651 3 All E.R. 801 at p. 806. 63 [1942] A.C. 154 at p. 184. 64 Julius Stone, Legal System and Lawyers' Reasonings (1964), pp. 258-260. 65 See for a full discussion [1964] C.L.J. 60 and 654. 66 [1966] C.L.J. 192 at p. 209. 67 Davis Contractors Ltd. v.

The evidence is that the Law Commissioners in dealing with interference with the " autonomy " of the contract are anxious to see that legally desirable reform reflects the feelings of fair-minded business men. SOME CONCLUSIONS 1. Although the distinction has been drawn between the funda- mental term and other terms, it is suggested that the time has now come to lay the concept quietly to rest. 2. Although liberty of contract has apparently been vindicated, the main purpose rule of construction is likely to haunt the drafts- man in the foreseeable future. His dilemma is well expressed by Diplock L.J. in Hardwicke Game Farm v. Sugolk Agricultural Poultry Producers Association, where, having defined a fundamental breach as a total failure by one party to perform a contract of the kind entered into, he states that-" So far as it appears from the words and conduct of the parties that they intended to enter into a contract of that kind an exceptions clause cannot be drafted in wide enough terms to cover this kind of event without either destroying the contract altogether or changing its character." 70 3. The return to Lord Atkin's views as expressed in Hain is welcome. Suggestions that a party in fundamental breach could not rely on exemptive provisions were leading to a situation in which fundamental breach was being treated differently according to whether it fell to be considered in relation to exemption clauses or apart from such clauses. In the former, the breach " displaced " the exemption clause, whereas for breaches without the complica- tion of an exemption clause it was the election of the injured party which determined the discharge or continuance of the contract. Suisse Atlantique makes it clear that the question of discharge depends solely on the election of the injured party--the Tolly device of partial affirmation is now dubious. Nevertheless, the effect of fundamental breach accepted by the party not in default upon conditions affected by an exemption clause still remains obscure. 4. It is respectfully submitted that their Lordships were right to reject deliberate breaches of contract as a separate species, although its relevance was conceded. To have compartmentalised breach into different types according to intention would have under- mined the basic premise of contract law, viz., that a breach of contract is non-performance of obligation. 69 Per Lord Loreburn in F. A. Tamplin Steamship Co. Ltd. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co. Ltd. [1916] 2 A.C. 397 at 403, expressing the implied term view of frustration which Lord Radcliffe sees as creating a logical difficulty (Davis case, supra). 70 [1966] 1 W.L.R. 287 at p. 343. 544 VOL. 30</page><page sequence="15">FUNDAMENTALISM IN CONTRACT THE FUTURE It is possible that the labours of the Working Party may result in that " urgent legislative action " which Lord Reid predicted would be necessary and it would be unwise to anticipate likely reforms. Certainly the complexity of the problem would seem to exclude any sweeping statutory amendment which would be as unselective as the old " doctrine " was said to be-one doubts if anything on the lines of the Israeli Law of Standard Contracts 1964 would work in a bigger and older country already partially covered by a patch-work quilt of " protective " legislation. Indeed, as is recognised, this is not purely a question of lawyers' law. At a time when price stability is recommended, the effect of imposing bigger liabilities upon " suppliers " would need to be borne in mind, whilst evidence of abuse of superior bargaining power would be required not only as regards the existence of unfair contracts but also of the extent to which advantage is taken of them. Perhaps the first task is the implementation of the recommendation of the Molony Committee on Consumer Protection to restrict the freedom to " contract out " of the conditions and warranties implied by the Sale of Goods Act 1893; the complexity of section 17 and 18 of the Hire-Purchase Act 1965 reflects that exclusions of liability can be quite fair. The Misrepresentation Act which came into force on April 22, 1967, provides that an agreement to exclude or restrict liability for negligent misrepresentation before the making of a contract shall be void unless the person making the misrepresenta- tion had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time of the contract that the facts represented were true (s. 4). Once enshrined in the contract, a false statement (provided it is not fraudulent) may be covered by an exemption clause excluding or restricting liability for such statement. Interference with liberty of contract stops short of misrepresentations incorporated into the contract. That the "excludability " of liability for negligent misrepresentation should depend upon whether or not such mis- representation is or is not incorporated into the contract contrasts with the desire of the Law Reform Committee that " the same remedies should be available to a purchaser whether or not the false statement is incorporated in the contract " (para. 16, 10th Report, Cmnd. 1782). Perhaps the source of the problem is the apathy of consumers and the severe limitations on the scope of the Consumer Council, which requires to be reconstituted in some way that will enable services (at present excluded, unless linked to the supply or treatment of goods) to be included in its terms of reference-bank guarantees and insurance are two obvious candidates. Its impotence in relation to individual cases and its tiny budget condemn it to a harmless anonymity. Business, at present reeling under an unusual spate of regulatory legislation (particularly in the last two years), can hardly relish 545 SEPT. 1967</page><page sequence="16">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW the idea of further encroachments on its contractual liberty. No doubt many in the business world feel that domestic machinery, perhaps through trade associations, could deal better with the policing of fair practices codes, as has been done in advertising, rather than by " tribunalising " yet another area of conflict. Domestic settlement, blanket prohibition or administrative tribunal, one thing appears likely-if by fundamentalism one means a return to the old orthodoxy, it is by no means certain that the individualist tradition of the common law will abandon its concern for com- mutative justice in the face of the standardised contract.
