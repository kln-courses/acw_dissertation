<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY Theologians have always distinguished between piety and idola- try, or sound and unsound, appropriate and inappropriate, forms or objects of worship. The question, however, arises: how can this distinction be justified? Is there not a danger that the harsh term "idol" will be used for what the other fellow worships and "God" for what the theologian worships? Is the criterion merely a deliverance of revelation (and there are competing revelations), or can reason have something to say in the matter? The term "reason", like the term "idolatry" is capable of question- begging usage. I hold with Popper that the essential method of reason is free criticism .The rational man is he who facilitates rather than obstructs criticism of his views. He is trying to think with other people's minds as well as his own, and also to offer his mind for the use of others. The pedant thinks only with the minds of others, the ignoramus or fanatic, only with his own mind, or that of some hero; the scholar and rational man thinks in both ways, and tries thus to correct, so far as he can, what is biassed or partial in his own perspective. No one fully and always lives up to this ideal of rationality. But it is the vigorous effort to be guided by it which distinguishes reasoning from "rationalization." That much theological argumentation is rationalization is commonplace ; that much antitheological thinking is equally so has long seemed to me manifest, and this conviction is a principal reason for my almost life-long effort to find new and more effective ways of applying logical analysis to the religious question. For logical thinking is thinking that recognizes impersonal principles and thus facilitates fair criticism. To say that logical principles cannot be used in this matter is to protect oneself against criticism from the outset. (This is equally so, nota bene, whether the pronouncement comes from religious or non- religious persons!) I have tried to proceed on the contrary assump-</page><page sequence="2">4 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION tion. If my discussions are illogical, I hope this will be pointed out; if I do not use sufficiently exact tools of analysis, this will be from lack of skill. Let others do better. I trust I shall be among the first to applaud them. But what do I mean by "the religious question?" One thinks of the vast variety of "religions." In Japan alone there are perhaps two hundred religious sects, many of them modern or recent, but some very old. Is there anything significant which they all have in com- mon? Or shall we set up criteria for the "higher religions," and thus simplify our task by taking these alone into account? Even so, what have the various Buddhisms, Hinduisms, and Christianity, Judaism, and Islam in common? My approach is indeed to concentrate on the higher religions, but also to look to these for that idea which is most susceptible to logical han- dling, by which I mean, the most sharply and consistently definable. For ideas so ambiguous, vague, logically paradoxical, or merely intuitive that only very special experience or insight can give them much meaning at all are not promising candidates for the applica- tion of reason as critical inquiry. Now there is a fundamental idea common at least to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, at their best, and with more or less close analogues in some forms of Hinduism and Buddhism (in spite of what is sometimes said of the latter), and this idea of course, is the idea of "God." To be sure, this may seem less a single idea than a large "family" of ideas, and without doubt some members of the family are "ambiguous, vague, logically pardoxical, or merely intuitive." But it is my proposal that there is an intuitive kernel of these ideas which is capable of a quite sharp and consistent definition, though it is not quite the usual definition of God. The many theologies and religious philosophies can then be seen in part as distortions, in various directions, of this essential content, and in part as accretions of additional elements which, however valuable they may be, are not logically part of the meaning of the "kernel" in question, so that the latter can be criticized inde- pendently. One of the maxims of reason is that what is logically independent should be criticized on its own merits or lack of them, and not made to stand or fall on the merits or demerits of some fur- ther assumption. Thus the validity of the idea of God cannot rea- sonably be made to depend upon, say, the status of some convention- al idea of immortality, or the idea of the class struggle, or of the</page><page sequence="3">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY 5 nature of the man Jesus, until or unless a clear logical relation of the one idea to the other has been shown. Since we have defined our topic as the rational criticism of religious ideas and have now proposed to narrow the latter down to ideas of God, we must obviously agree that, whatever the term "God" is to mean, it should refer to something dealt with, at least ostensibly, in the higher religions - or some of them. The term thus will stand for the object of religious devotion or worship (or, since some persons have a "mental cramp" connected with the word "object", for the One who is worshipped). At once an objection arises to our entire endeavor. How can the object of worship be subjected to rational inquiry? Is not "a God understood" by that very fact turned into an "idol"? Would we not be condescending to the deity instead of worshipping, if we could define and penetrate its nature? I answer: it is not God we are seek- ing to define and penetrate but "God", the name of the object of worship, not that object itself; and though many skeptics hold that the worshipper really has no object but his own idea, this is one of the matters to be calmly inquired into. On any but such a skeptical assumption, the idea of God is not God, and the definition of the former need not be anything remotely like a complete elucidation of the latter. For we have not to distinguish the divine actuality in all possible ways from other entities, but only the term "God" from other terms sufficiently to give the word a clear and reasonable use in our language. We shall see that such clarity concerning "God" will not contradict, but will require abysmal and impenetrable mystery in God. And yet we shall see also that it is even a religious imperative that "God" stand for an eminently rational idea, indeed the eminently rational idea. Among the views which my inquiry has arrived at are the following : (1) Arguments over the religious question have in very substan- tial part been defences or attacks upon belief not in God but in an "idol," either philosophical, such as "the Absolute," or popular, such as the notion of a cosmic moral-legal Bookkeeper and Policeman who sees to it that deeds unrewarded or unpunished in this life re- ceive their due in another - a human, all-too-human notion of cosmic arrangements. Very often both idolatries have occurred together in the same mind. Not the One Worshipped was really under direct discussion, but the imputed object of some deceptive</page><page sequence="4">6 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION substitute for worship. Worship is not the flight from a hellish, or the search for a heavenly, aftermath to death. (2) It is possible to define "worship as such," and therefore the term "God" as name for the One worshipped, so as in principle to draw a reasonable line between idolatry, philosophical or naive, and belief in God. (3) When this is done, it turns out that the idea of deity we arrive at is in important respects more open to rational philosophical treatment and defence than are the ideas which many theologians have had on the subject, and many philosophers as well, whether in Europe or Asia. (4) If there is any sort of truth in the myth of the Fall of Man, and I suspect that there is and that psychiatry is giving us a helpful account of this truth (to be sure, rather far from the account found in Augustine), this truth may perhaps furnish a partial explanation, on a subtle level, of some features in the history of man's thought about God, including professional theological thought. It may well be that even rather standard views about the divine, such as have been held by some high authorities, are tinged with human perver- sity and rebellion against the Most High. At any rate, the concept of Fall seems to imply the possibility. (5) What Pascal called the "God of the Philosophers" is not to be identified with the God of philosophy as such, but only of one stage, which I call the Classical (analogous to Classical Physics, though much older), in the development of that subject. Philosophy has been moving into a new stage, which I term the Neoclassical, and the God of philosophy in the future can hardly be equivalent to the God of philosophy in the past, say in the time of Pascal, who perhaps first referred to it. (6) Similarly, the "God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" is a more or less problematic expression. It is no wholly simple matter to put ourselves in the place of these Biblical characters. And today Biblical scholarship sees these things rather differently than in Pas- cal's time. In any case, the God of the Gospels, and of the greatest rabbis of later Judaism, and some thinkers of Islam, and of still other religions, may be more significant for us now, in our danger- ously One World. Above all, the rational evaluation (positive or negative) of our religious inheritance cannot be attained if we persist in taking stereotypes and cliches for more than they are. There is no</page><page sequence="5">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY J unambiguous, obvious, generally and clearly recognized "God of philosophy", or of "religion", or of "Christianity." The question of idolatry is always relevant. If we worship, we should try to worship God, not "God," i.e., someone's definition of the word; and if we criticize worship, we should try to deal with the best as well as mediocre forms. (7) The chief problem is whether it is possible simultaneously to avoid both naive and philosophical idolatry. The weapon of those intent upon avoiding naive idolatry at all costs is the polemical use of such expressions as "anthropomorphic," "big brother in the sky," "finite God," "God entangled in matter", and the like. If one argues (as I do) that God must be thought of as "receptive," sensitive to all "stimuli" or "influences," "sympathetic," as well as ideally active and powerful, one is accused with some scorn of the naive blunder of regarding God as a mere "magnified nonnatural man" (Matthew Arnold), whereas, on the contrary, it is said, he is "wholly other than man!" And the weapon of those intent upon avoiding philo- sophical idolatry at all costs is to employ vague or ambiguous terms like "pantheism" pejoratively, or to argue from an allegedly revealed doctrine of the entire otherness of God to the impossibility of a philosophical understanding of him. But this is to forget, or take too little into account, the historical evidence that it was Greek philoso- phy which set up a neat, absolute dichotomy between the changing, temporal world and a deity so perfect that (Plato) it could not change for the better (and certainly not for the worse) and so al- together unlike us as to be quite immune to influence from accidental, temporal things (Aristotle), and hence quite incapable of any emo- tions (the Stoics). (8) The simultaneous avoidance of naive and philosophical idolatry is not to be secured by putting all the stress upon the one danger or the other. In life generally evils come in contraries, and while we back violently away from the chasm we see, we may fall into the unseen pit which is at our backs. Any sophisticated person can scorn "anthropomorphism," but as Hume saw, better than some theologians of his age, it is equally ridiculous to suppose that one can worship an empty abstraction like Cause, or Immutable Absolute and the like. I want to quote an historian of our problem whose scholarly authority I incline to rate very highly.</page><page sequence="6">8 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION Now when Aristotle began to apply the term "God" to his impersonal prime mover, and ere he endowed it with thought, he felt a certain impropriety in his identifying it with the god of Greek popular religion, and he asked himself: "If it thinks nothing, what is there here of dignity ? It is just like one who sleeps." He eased his intellectual conscience, however, by endowing his prime mover with thought of itself, and, having done so, he was quite pleased with his performance and believed that he had thereby succeeded in transforming it into a "living being, eternal, most good." Perhaps Spinoza, too, felt some qualms of intellectual conscience when he identified the God of Scriptural tradition with his substance, and perhaps, like Aristotle, he justified himself by endowing his substance with consciousness and believed that thereby his substance was transformed into a "living being, eternal, most good". But still, the life which characterizes the Scriptural concep- tion of God and which theologians, Jewish, Christian, and Mohammedan, who wished to remain true to Scriptural tradition tried to preserve, often in violation of their logic, was not the life of an eternal paralytic, who is conscious and sees all and hears all and knows all, but is helpless to do anything at will; it was the life which, after the analogy of our own life, meant a capacity for change and a consciousness of freedom of action. It is the anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms of the Scriptures, which theologians tried to explain away, just as much as the monotheism, which they were so eager to justify, that constitute, historically, the essential character of the Scriptural God, [my italics] and it was for this reason that theologians throughout the ages tried to save as much of these anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms as possible, even though sometimes what they succeeded in saving was only the empty sounds of words. By depriving God of this kind of life, by exploding even the fiction that such a kind of life was attributed to Him when words to that effect were used, by openly disclaiming the need of maintaining such a fiction, Spinoza broke away from the tradi- tional theology and started a new kind of theology and a new kind of rationalization.1 Of course much depends upon what is meant by "anthropopa- thism" and "anthropomorphism." But one of the essential questions of religious philosophy is bared in this great passage. There is cer- tainly such a thing as the uncritical imputation of human attitudes and feelings to deity, but there is also such a thing as (Peirce) "the latest patent absolute" [or the oldest, what does it matter?] which, in spite of the theorist's proud disdain for the actual content of religious worship, is really but an intellectual anthropomorphism taking the place of the naive and emotional form. The problem is to escape both of these ways in which man worships himself (or his own invention). As Hume saw, more clearly than Kant, the question is not so much, Who is on the right side of the theistic argument (whether this concerns the existence or the knowability of God) ? but rather, What is the argument about? What is the reasonable use of the term "God?" An idol is an inappropriate object of worship. The Greek gods might be objects of wonder and admiration and, if one believed that 1 Harry Austryn Wolfson, The Philosophy of Spinoza (Harvard University Press, 1948), II, 346 f.</page><page sequence="7">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY 9 they had done one a good turn, of gratitude; but worship is incomparably more than wonder, admiration, and gratitude. One can feel in all of these ways toward human beings. But worship imports finding the entire meaning of life, all its value, in relation to the one worshipped. I take this to be implied by the prescription, love God with all one's heart and mind and soul and strength. One can try to do this with a human being, or a human class, or the entire species, but one cannot literally succeed. The nonhuman world is also interesting on its own account, and we cannot be simply indifferent to the possibility of the human species ceasing to exist, although if it did this tragedy would not be an evil humanly suffered as such by man, for no one experiences his own cessation, and no species can do so. In this and other ways we can, I think, see that worship relates us to something transhuman, something genu- inely secure against its own destruction and somehow inclusive of all that we in any way care about. The inappropriately anthropomorphic ideas of God clearly fail to meet these requirements. The God of William James, for example, was not clearly immortal, and was explicitly said to be less than all- inclusive. Whatever was not included must be of no interest what- ever to the worshipper, if our definition of the latter is valid. James gives us no reason to think that the excluded factors are without interest. Indeed it is contradictory to recognize something as real, and deny that one has in this something at least a minimal interest. Referring to something is already such an interest. The worshipful reality cannot be less than all-inclusive. A literally all-inclusive as well as immortal reality is more than any "magnified nonnatural man." It is something in principle exalted above humanity. It is also mysterious ; indeed, it includes all mystery whatever. Can the philosophical or intellectual idols be worshipped? Take the concept of "unmoved mover". Either it fails to include the chan- ges of the world, in which nevertheless we cannot but be interested, or it includes them. The first will not do; the second implies that what seems the becoming of novelty, step by step, is not really that, since every item that becomes is, on the hypothesis, immovably and eternally there as constituent of the unmoved. Events are all included in what is no event, something that happens, but only a being, something that primordially and everlastingly is. Becoming cannot be included in being, for it is the richer concept. As Aristotle put it,</page><page sequence="8">10 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION whereas change or becoming involves potentiality, deity is pure actuality, free from any aspect of internal potentiality. All that his God could be he eternally is; but then our interest in actualizing possibilities must be an interest not in God but only in something external to him. I conclude that the philosophical absolute, largely inherited from the Greeks, is an idol, not the meaning of "God." We cannot limit our interest to being, but must be interested also in becoming, which is more than being. (Even Barth sees this, as did Buber and Berdyaev.) That the divine becoming was often denied has a num- ber of grounds. One is this. The actualization of a possibility is more than the mere possibility, hence, some conclude, the supreme or maximal reality must be sheer actuality, devoid of possibility, hence immutable. The hidden fallacy is, of course, that possibility involves mutual incompatibilities, Leibniz's "incompossibles", so that the idea of the complete actualization of possibility is a pseudo-idea, a contradiction. In rebuttal, traditionalists argue that the sort of possibilities which are incapable of complete joint realization are irrelevant. They concern not what God is or might be but only what worlds he could have as his creations. But this defence fails. For either having a certain world rather than another is simply nothing to God or it is something. If it is something, then God in having world W rather than world W is not entirely the same in quality; also, since he might have had W and might have had whatever contribution this would make to his reality, intrinsic divine possibilities must be admitted after all. If, on the other hand, it is nothing to God that he has the actual creatures he does have, and nothing to him that we do this when we might have done that, then let us hear no more of God's "loving" the world. It is too late to torture or tease human beings with this sort of double talk. And moreover, since we have to care about what happens in the world, whether God cares or not, he cannot be the referent of our entire love, interest, devotion, and yet be indifferent to alternatives in the world. I hold then that the intellectuals have their form of false worship just as the simple-minded have theirs. No reader of the Gospels, or even of Buddhism, should find this surprising. Is there an escape from both forms of false worship? I see, at least as in a glass darkly, such an escape. We can rule out the popular,</page><page sequence="9">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY I I anthropomorphic idols by requiring that deity be not only actually superior to other beings which exist but potentially superior to any which could exist, in the following sense : if there were, or when there is, an actuality superior to what God actually is, it would or will be God himself in a superior state. Or, as dear old Fechner, an unheeded voice in the wilderness, put it, only God can surpass God, and he con- tinually does so. In this increase in content and value, all other chan- ge can be embraced. Bergson's cumulative view of becoming, adopted by Peirce, Montague, and Whitehead, comes in here. We worship God, not because he is complete once for all, immune to becoming, but because his becoming is Eminent in kind and scope, the integration, step by step, of all lesser becoming. For three centuries this idea has in principle been available, since the writings of Fausto Socinus and Johannes Krell. Increasingly, philosophers are taking it into account. It is pleasant to note that not only did the Socinians attribute all- inclusive becoming to deity but they rightly connected this with the idea of freedom. Man has a humble share in the freedom or creativi- ty which in Eminent form is deity. Hence, they argued, divine knowl- edge of our acts cannot be complete in eternity since, until we decide our deeds, there are no such things for God to know. God cannot know our decisions beforehand ; for they do not precede themselves and he would be knowing what is not so. Still less, and herewith the Thomistic solution is rejected, can God know our actions eternally, for if they do not precede themselves in time still less do they exist eternally. (This would be infinite, rather than merely finite, prece- dence.) Lequier, two centuries after Socinus, agreed with his almost forgotten predecessors. His arguments were careful, patient, learned, and deadly. They went unanswered, so far as I know. Hocking, Montague, Hartshorne, Whitehead (temporally in that order) took up the idea, all at a time when they perhaps knew nothing of Socinus or Lequier. There is a new natural theology. It is new not in some trifling emphasis or detail but in principle. Becoming takes the place of being, as Hume, Schelling, Nietzsche, Bergson, Montague, and others have said it should do. God is Eminent becoming, and that includes all the Emient being there is need for since, by Bergson's cumulative conception, becoming is the synthesis of permanence and novelty, leaving no "being" outside itself.</page><page sequence="10">I 2 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION There is a subtle reason why so many great minds could be deceived into thinking that the Greek concept of perfection defined God. They persuaded themselves that what they were doing was modestly to deny the applicability of our human notions to the divine. Unlike us, God does not change; he is not "alive" in the ordinary sense of having successive adventures and experiences. He is not "limited" by any opposing force, he does not have a physical or extended body, he does not consist of parts (which might be torn asunder or drift apart), he is not the victim of influences, nor can anyone act upon or give him anything - for he lacks no positive value. This procedure, the "negative way", seemed modest since it claimed to exalt God above all that we can conceive. But there was deception in this modesty. It was not and could not be consistently applied. God, it was said, is not acted upon; but the negative way should mean that it is equally true that he does not act. Yet who dared to say this? God is not effect. Was it equally asserted that he is not cause? Effect and cause are alike human ideas. God is not evil, but he is, according to theologians generally, good. True, it was held that God is not merely an instance of good but goodnes itself, good- ness in a unique or Eminent sense. But then perhaps God is also Eminently a sufferer of evil, as the heresy of "patripassionism" held, and as the crucified Jesus seems to symbolize. God is Eminently being, why not Eminently becoming? It might be argued that what was negated in the negative theolo- gy was really itself negative, mere privation or limitation. But this defense fails also. To become is not a simple negative of to be. Is it even a partial negative? It is indeed the positive overcoming of a previous partial privation. But since there are incompossible forms of actuality, there are bound, by a priori necessity, to be privations. So the only alternative to becoming as the overcoming of such privations would have to be the total non-realization of any among incompossible values. Thus becoming is as positive as anything can be. It cannot be claimed that the negative way is merely the denial of essentially negative or privative attributes. Rather it is an arbi- trary mixture of assertion and denial. No matter what aspect of the negative theology we consider, we find that the pretended device of not applying human concepts breaks down or is capriciously applied. Consistently applied it would make deity indistinguishable from nonentity. The only consistent</page><page sequence="11">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY I 3 way to relate God to the ultimate polarities, such as actuality and possibility, being and becoming, is to recognize an Eminent form of both. I have argued this in many places. My term for the doctrine is the "principle of dual transcendence." The contention that a rational idea of God cannot be appropriate seems to overlook two relevant considerations. We are to love God with our minds as well as hearts : this implies that, as far as we are intellectual, an "intellectual love" of God must be possible. But then there must be some rational content for the idea we have of him. The other consideration is that, defining "God" as I define the term, that is as suitable object of total devotion, and as surpassable only by himself, Eminent both in being and becoming, both as cause and as effect, both as actual and as potential, both as inde- pendent and as dependent - this definition, while it removes many traditional paradoxes (really, I hold, contradictions), still leaves all sorts of mysteries and some to me troublesome puzzles. Indeed, all the puzzles there are turn up as puzzles about God. As an obvious example, take the puzzle of relativity physics, which according to some physicists implies that there can be no division between a determinate or actual past and an indeterminate or potential future, a contention that contradicts a basic principle of the new view. In any case it has always been clear for those who think a little that an all-knowing being must remain unknown to us in real aspects of his actuality to just the extent that we fall short of omniscience. All things are in God, including all things unknown or puzzling to us. We need have no fear that the divine reality will ever be as an open book to any man. But we might stop talking certain kinds of nonsense about this reality. It will perhaps be apparent to the reader how I have been using the term "eminent." It means, unsurpassable unless by self. I have shown elsewhere that this implies that those properties capable of an absolute or unsurpassable form must in God be unsurpassable even by God himself. In this aspect God is indeed "the absolute." But it is only an aspect, an abstraction, not the full reality of deity. In other aspects God is surpassed only by himself. To the question, what reason have we for believing in Eminent as well as ordinary becoming, I answer here only by referring to what I expect to publish on this subject in The Monist for April, 1970 and in Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method, to appear about that</page><page sequence="12">14 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION time. The question just is whether ordinary becoming is intelligible in its own terms, supposing this to be the only form, or whether instead the more intelligible view of becoming is that it involves an inherent, duality, ordinary-eminent, each side necessary to the other. This does not mean that we are necessary to God, but only that God must have some creatures or other. (Though we are not necessary to God we are valuable to him. We contribute to the degree of his self-surpassing value increase.) I will say one thing here, not about arguments for belief but about one argument against it. The atheistic argument from evil assumes, in my opinion without justification, that the Eminent or worshipful form of power means omnipotence in the conventional sense, or some unjustified approximation thereto, whereas the adequate generalization of the Socinian insight consists in holding that divine power could not possibly deprive a single creature of at least some minimal range of freedom, so that, if X occurs, where X is any con- crete happening, it can never be the case that God decided upon the occurrence of X. Always something was left to the decision of each and every creature involved. The very atoms are not without limit determined by divine action, but have a modicum of self-determi- nation. In this philosophy all any agent can do is to influence, never determine, what other individuals do. Einstein's wonderfully pithy and candid saying, "I cannot believe in a dice-throwing God" denies exactly what a neo-Socinian affirms. God takes chances on what his creatures will do, under certain natu- ral laws divinely decreed for the world. Moreover, this is all any God could do. There can be no such thing as one individual simply determining the actions of other individuals. Hence the supposition that the evils of the world are deliberately inflicted upon the world by God is to be rejected. To argue that at least divine power should but does not, prevent the evils is to imply that if God had set up certain alternative laws, or certain other limitations upon creaturely freedom, there would have been no risk, or less risk, of evil. But any possible divine directives would still leave universal freedom and therefore universal risk. This is all we know in the matter. With other divine actions the risks of evil would indeed have been different, but it does not follow, and we could not possibly know, that the risks of evil, as balanced against the opportunities for good, would have been less. We see every day that with nontrivial opportunities go</page><page sequence="13">TWO FORMS OF IDOLATRY I 5 nontrivial risks, and I hold that we have insight into an a priori principle here. The notion of a harmless Utopia is a pseudoconcept, and generates no legitimate problem of evil. One may object, with Hume, that God might have a world with- out natural laws, such as gravity, which take no account of the good or evil of the particular case. But there are values in having such laws. How is it to be proved that the disvalues outweigh the values? I am not impressed with the insight some claim to have into possible worlds, granted the principle of universal freedom. And if this prin- ciple is not granted, the language game becomes trivial or meaning- less, so far I can see. "God" refers to worshipful freedom, ' 'creature" to lesser forms of freedom. Without both ideas there is no theistic problem. If the best known traditional ideas of God fell into idolatrous anthropomorphism, either of the popular emotional or the intellec- tual variety, or both, then in so far the traditional arguments for these ideas were a menace to religion, which may be grateful to Hume and Kant for their demolition! It is a different question whether arguments for a non-anthropomorphic (or legitimately anthropomorphic) idea are possible, and how they might be con- structed. I wish to repeat what I have said before: this job cannot be put off upon our ancestors. They dealt with their problem concern- ing the rational evidence, or lack of it, for the truth of their religious idea; not with what should be our problem. Let the dead bury their dead.
