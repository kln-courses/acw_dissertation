<plain_text><page sequence="1">p pp pp e Keith N icklin (1946-2002) "Who was that Masked Man?" '' i L o Condition Permanent," "A Great Tree Has Fallen," "A Legend in His Own Time"... Never easy to write an obitu- ary. Perhaps one can for an elder-far harder for a mate. Who was this endearing man who jousted with the world from a coracle and lived his art as much as he wrote it? Keith Nicklin may have enjoyed wearing masks more than he did studying them, but that doesn't mean he was less a scholar for it. His was an infectious madness, and in a crazy world, we need such exuberance. And, no, we shouldn't make more of folks in death than they were in life. Keith could be exasperating and unpredictable, as Jill Salmons (wife, colleague, co-conspirator) eloquently expressed in her wonderful eulogy: Living with Keith was like camping on the slopes of a volcano-much of the time he was dormant, or gently smoldering, but there was always the knowledge, the thrill, yet the dread that soon he was going to erupt into some kind of unexpected, dramatic activity, be it fieldwork, writing or producing another weird and won- derful artwork. Keith's funeral, an appropriate blend of traditional English ceremony, African drum- mers, bamboo coffin, and libations at the grave, served to remind us of the real cycle of life: Keith died of cancer on his birthday, Sep- tember 2, 2002, and the funeral was held on his wedding anniversary. Testimonials flowed in from colleagues in Nigeria, museum cura- tors all over England, and African-art scholars everywhere. All recalled in touching personal words his dedication and dignity, his wisdom and wit. After completing an M.A. in anthropolo- gy at University College, London, in 1970, Keith became an ethnographer for the Nige- rian National Commission for Museums and Monuments. His most important fieldwork began at this time as he surveyed and collect- ed in the Cross River area, later expanding into the whole of southeastern Nigeria. In addition to collecting a vast range of material culture for the National Museum, Oron, he documented and photographed archaeologi- cal sites, local craft industries, individual artists, and village shrines, working inces- santly, often in remote areas, under extreme- ly trying conditions. Without doubt this was 11 Keith's happiest time. He loved his work and the Cross River peoples and was able to pass on his enthusiasm and skills to a number of young Nigerian undergraduates seconded to him to appreciate the importance of ethno- graphic research and the collection of oral history. In his own words: I am a proponent of in-depth ethno- graphic methodology of the observ- er/participant kind, and combine this approach with cross-cultural analysis of key institutions, beliefs and prac- tices. I am primarily interested in African art and material culture from archaeological evidence, through "traditional" village contexts, to con- temporary and urban modes of ex- pression. I am concerned with the concept of art as social commentary, and with the analysis and apprecia- tion of material artworks. Wherever appropriate I have developed new field techniques, e.g., retrieval or res- cue studies, and applied scientific methods, e.g., pyrometry for record- ing pottery firing temperatures, and thermoluminescence (TL) analysis for dating core samples of copper alloy castings discovered in the field. This fairly dry description in no way cap- tures the enthusiasm and love with which Keith engaged "the field," both African and art. Clearly Nigeria gave him room and cause to develop his talents. Cross River Fever? Probably. Whatever, no one worked or played harder while in "the field." And the field really was home for him. Keith and Jill would take off for various parts of the world at the drop of a mask. There is much material from recent trips to Ghana and Brazil still unfinished, as are various notes from southeastern Nigeria. Jill recalls: I loved doing fieldwork with Keith, and I know we were a good duo-me nosy as hell, continually prying into history and rituals, Keith methodically photographing, measuring, recording the technology accurately, albeit in ter- rible handwriting, and spending vast amounts of time getting to the heart of the men's culture through long drink- ing sessions in local palmwine and kaikai bars. Keith and Jill did finally return to Eng- land, and in 1979 Keith became curator of the Powell-Cotton Museum of African and Asian Zoology and Ethnography in Birchington, Kent. He was able to promote the importance of the Powell-Cotton African collection and create a number of new exhibitions. He also set up close academic links with the an- thropology department of the University of Kent. Moving on in 1982 to the Horniman Museum in south London, as Keeper of Eth- nography Keith developed a number of im- portant exhibitions there as well. Again we have Jill's perspective: Nothing gave him greater pleasure than taking the piss out of bureaucrats or those hapless people brought into the museum world to implement stan- dardization and the ghastly govern- ment strictures that have stultified creativity. It was his total dismay at this wave of crass paperisation that led him to leave his beloved Homiman. Keith worked hard and accomplished more than even he realized. Some of us may have pestered him for not writing more, but he did write (see page 90 for a list of his publi- cations). He was a constant critic of himself and always self-effacing, despite a blustery ex- terior in professional company. Keith's careful analyses of the Oron ancestor carvings in his major monograph, Ekpu: The Oron Ancestor Figures of South Eastern Nigeria (1999), and his 12african arts winter 2002 12 african arts - winter 2002</page><page sequence="2">Keith Nicklin in an Igbo costume from Aba market, decorated with Christmas tree lights. detailed studies of skin-covered mask production and Lower Niger bronzes demonstrated his concern with seri- ous scholarship. His many articles on ceramics, metal works, and carvings appeared in a variety of important journals such as African Arts, Ceramic Review, Nyame, Pottery Quarterly, Raw Vision, and World Archaeology, but some of his favorite journals were de- cidedly obscure-his devotion to the hoary Journal of the Nigerian Field Society being a case in point. There were important contributions as well to anthologies on African arts and museology, such as Ways of the Rivers and Collectors: Expressions of Self and Other. In addition to his published scholarship, Keith's museum work-- perhaps even more valuable for communicating about Africa-was exceptional. He rebuilt the museum at Oron in southeaster Nigeria and created or consulted on many im- portant exhibitions throughout Eng- land. Especially memorable at the Horniman were his comprehensive but typically lively and popular Yoruba show ("Yoruba: A Celebration of African Art," 1991-92) and his contributions to the permanent "African Worlds" exhibition. Keith's ingenuity was not exhausted by his excellent museum work but led him to find extraordinary ways to fund further fieldwork, such as the instance when he and colleagues gained support from the Royal Artillery. Still, it is as an exceptionally human indi- vidual that most of us remember him. There was something deliberately, decidedly tradi- tional about Keith's approaches to both his personal and professional life. Marriage was forever, children really were your flesh and blood, home was a man's castle, hospitality was always generous, meals and beverages were meant to be substantial. Whether objects or people, old things were to be treasured for their historical virtues and for the forms of life they represented. In a similar fashion, profes- sionally Keith sought to align himself with a certain historical tradition of expatriate schol- ars of African art whom he considered to be highly professional and culturally liberated- people like Kenneth Murray, Bill Fagg, and Roy Sieber. This is not to say Keith considered himself their equal, or even one of their com- pany. But they were, in a sense, his heroes, his role models. After leaving the Horiman, Keith became an art consultant and gentleman farmer as he and Jill worked to restore a wonderful six- teenth-century farmhouse at Vmesend. Some of us were fortunate enough to share in Keith and Jill's enduring craziness in the English countryside. We will never forget the Glitter Party in Bromyard, where our Camden Mar- ket finery was trumped by their spectacular Cross River fancy hats. Nor will students ever forget "that guy in the African paja- mas." Nor can Jill forget fighting with Keith over who would wear her col- orful coats. Some worried about Keith's clothing habits, but, yes, truth be told, he was a Cross River dresser! And his constant urge to masquerade was displayed not only in Nigeria with his group, Urban Gorilla, but in rural England as well. Our kids still remember an afternoon walk in a properly hoary English woods with Keith lurching out from behind trees in full gorilla costume. Most famous of his costume wardrobe was his Yuletide disguise as a full Christmas tree complete with lights. An old English farmhouse- where else to display a delightfully eclectic personal collection of African art and objects trouves. Keith's office in the tower of the Horniman had a gorilla's head looking out the window over the main entrance. Like all prop- er academic offices, his was a chaotic whirl of books, papers, carvings, "art brut"; one day I kicked something under my chair only to discover a pair of metal tennis shoes, a gift from Sokari Douglas Camp. Indeed, art is everywhere, and Keith seldom missed the diverse and unique expressions of human creativity. Keith did serious fieldwork, pub- lished important research, and con- tributed to excellent exhibitions of African arts; but most important to us was his respect for artists and performers, his delight in sharing that extraordinary joy which people put into their arts. Art is to be savored, handled, consumed, not just studied. Keith gave us that wonderful enthusiasm. If anyone is qualified to dance with the ancestors, it is this man. And in his company we are quite sure that those ancestors will have some riotously good times. A final cele- bration of his transition from this world to that of the ancestors is planned by Jill and their sons, Jon and Keiran: a return to Oron with a small Ghanaian coffin (appropriately in the form of a lion) containing token sym- bolic items. An occasion no doubt for the cre- ation of a memorial cement statue by Sunday Jack Akpan. O Philip M.

SLOGAR: Notes, from page 27 [This article was accepted for publication in July 2002.] 1. Excerpted from the praise poetry (oriki) of the sculptor Ojerinde, called Adugbologe. Quoted in Wolff 1985:104. 2. Ijebu refers to a Yoruba group southeast of Abeokuta. Other Yoruba peoples mentioned in this article include Egba, Egbado, Owu, and Oyo. 3. Major contributions to the study of Ogboni brasses include the following: Morton-Williams 1960, 1964; Williams 1964, 1974; Thompson 1971; Dobbelman 1976; Roach-Selk 1978; Brincard 1982; Witte 1988; Drewal 1989; Drewal, Pemberton III &amp; Abiodun 1989; Gosline 1989, 1992; Lawal 1995. 4. For Osugbo doors from Ijebu, see, for example, Dobbelmann 1976: figs. 156-57 and Drewal, Pemberton III &amp; Abiodun 1989:123. 5. Drewal cites Fagg photographs nos. 49-50/44/12, The Robert Goldwater Library, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. A duplicate set can be found at the Eliot Elisofon Photographic Archives, National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. I should note that I have seen the images; as Fagg indicated that the carvings were from Ila Orangun, they are quite different from the works under consideration here, in terms of not only style but iconography. 6. A related work is 87.R.234, apparently a more recent version of a standing Ogboni official in the style of the Adugbologe workshop in Abeokuta (H. 89cm). 7. This article is the result of research I began during a 1998 project while serving as a graduate curatorial assistant at the Art Gallery, University of Maryland, College Park. I want to thank the university's Department of Art History and Archae- ology for sponsoring that position, and Terry Gips, then the Art Gallery's director, for overseeing it. I am indebted to the many kind individuals who so patiently offered their assis- tance, in particular Nath Mayo Adediran, Letty Bonnell, Timothy Chappel, Liesl Dana, Elizabeth Dell, David Doris, Rotimi Elufioye, Ekpo Eyo, Bryna Freyer, Christraud Geary, Scott Habes, U. Heijs-Voorhuis, Ken Ingels, Victoria James, Jack Keeve, Babatunde Lawal, Lily MacKinnon, Gabriel Oko, Tris Perkins, David Prince, Janet Stanley, Christine Stelzig, Katherine Sthreshley, Holger Stoecker, Hans Witte, Norma Wolff, Dorit Yaron, the African &amp; Related Art Gallery, Amster- dam, and a private collector. I thank you all. 8. The sash is named itagbe in Ijebu and shaki among the Egba. See Aronson 1992:101, n. 29. Such cloths function as emblems of power and rank, particularly for chiefs and Ogboni or Osugbo members (Aronson 1992:53). The bird-surmounted hat is vari- ously called fila, ate, or akete (Babatunde Lawal, personal com- munication, April 5, 2001). Henry Drewal uses the term ege to denote these wide-brimmed hats, which he relates to the head- gear of sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Catholic (Iberian or Italian) clergy (see Drewal 1989:167). 9. Concerning this system of fashioning composite objects, Hans Witte also notes: "Not only were the figure-groups assembled from different statues, but many Egungun masks from Abeokuta are nothing but an assemblage of separate pieces nailed around the main figure. It suggests there was something of an Adugbologe carving factory where separate pieces were carved in advance, so that a mask could be put together according to the client's wishes. In these circum- stances it becomes, of course, difficult to assign a mask to one carver" (personal communication, April 16, 2002). 10. On the Ogboni preference for the left, see Drewal, Pember- ton III &amp; Abiodun 1989:140, 142; Lawal 1995:43-44. 11. Although for the sake of convenience I refer to the "Adugbologe workshop" in the singular, there are in fact sev- eral distinct workshops within Adugbologe Compound. See Wolff 1985:142. 12. For details about the founding and history of the Adugbologe workshop, see Chappel 1972, 1981; Wolff 1985. 13.

Lawal also notes that miniature versions of the same compo- sition, cast in brass, can be found on altars. 17. Also Chappel, personal communication, July 17, 2001: "According to his grandson, Ayoola, Ojerinde established an Ogboni house in Itoko township some time before he finally took refuge in Abeokuta with the people of Aibo in 1851 or thereabouts. Indeed, Ayo went so far as to claim that it was Ojerinde who instructed the Egba in the 'real,' esoteric work- ings of the society." 18.
