<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRED L. BURWICK Holderlin and Arnold: Empedocles on Etna IFTY YEARS before the appearance of Arnold's Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems (1852), Friedrich Holderlin had struggled with the sources on Empedocles,1 trying to forge them into a unified dramatic and poetic form. He failed, and his three attempts, written between 1797 and 1800, were left in fragmentary drafts. Not until 1826 did one of the drafts appear in print,2 and only after his death were all three fragments published together in his Sdimtliche Werke (1846).3 Before Arnold only Holderlin had attempted such a dramatic treatment of Empedocles. Although the first and most complete of his fragments exhibits the same dramatic structure as Arnold's poem, no critic has yet discussed the many similarities between the two poems, and only Louis Bonnerot has mentioned the possibility that Arnold might have been inspired by the Holderlin fragments.4 1 The sources of Empedocles are primarily the fragment (450 lines) of Emped- ocles' philosophical works, the eulogy written by Lucretius, and the biography by Diogenes Laertius. All these sources are discussed by Walter Kranz, EnIpe- dokles, antike Gestalt und romanztische Neuschapfung (Zuirich, 1949). For an English translation of the fragments see John Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy (New York, 1960; first edition, 1897). See also C. D. Yonge's translation of Diog- enes Laertius, The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers (London, 1909). Matthew Arnold drew, in addition, from Simon Karsten, Philosophorum Grae- corum Veterium Reliquiae, I (1830) and II (1838) ; the second volume is de- voted entirely to Empedocles: his life and studies, his works, a textual commen- tary on his works, and a lengthy comparative study on his philosophy. 2 The third draft, "Empedokles auf dem Atna," appeared in Gcdichte (Stutt- gart and Tiibingen, 1826). 3 Hilderlins Siinmtliche Werke (Stuttgart and Tiibingen, 1846), 2 vols., pub- lished with a biography by Christoph Theodor Schwab. 4 Matthew Arnold, Emipedocle sur l'Etna (Empedocles on Etna), Etude critique et traduction (Paris, 1947), p. 77.

But there is more similarity of both structure and poetic emphasis in their dramas than may be easily attributed to common sources. The opening act of H6lderlin's first drama is concerned primarily with the circumstances of Empedocles' departure from Agrigentum; the second act is set, like the whole of Arnold's play, "am Atna."7 Here Arnold and Holderlin present the main philosophical statements in the same dramatic sequence: first Empedocles delivers his long pre- ceptive song to Pausanias; then, as he approaches the crater after Pau- sanias leaves, he explains in monologue his strange mood of exaltation in death. The problem of Empedocles' identity, the nature of his exile, is cen- tral in both dramatic poems. This is the problem that Delia reflects upon as she wanders through Empedocles' garden in the first scene of Holderlin's play: Wie lebt er mit andern? Ich begreife nichts von diesem Manne, Hat er wie wir auch seine leeren Tage, Wo man sich alt und unbedeutend diinkt? Und giebt es auch ein menschlich Laid fur ihn? (I, i, 24-28 ) 8 1846, mais rien ne permet meme de supposer qu'il en ait connu l'existence. Cette ceuvre mele tres heureusement la dialectique a l'interet humain, lequel n'est nulle part sacrifie. Meme dans le troisieme fragment, la Mlort d'Empedocle, qui est le plus pur, Holderlin se prolposait de placer, a c6te du h6ros, de nombreux person- nages, un chceur antique et Pantheia, qui devait figurer dans ce fragment comme la sceur d'Empedocle-alors que dans les deux premiers fragments, elle etait la femme de celui-ci." 5 See note 1 above. 0 Kranz, pp. 86-87. 7 Setting direction for Act II of H6lderlin's first draft. The third draft, which is usually printed under the title "Empedokles auf dem Atna" (the title under which it was originally published), is referred to as "Der Tod des Empedokles- III," by critics who argue that all three drafts were intended to have the same title. 8 Sdiitliche Werke (Stuttgart, 1961), IV-1, 4.

I know not in what mind Empedocles, Whose mules I follow'd, may be coming up, But if, as most men say, he is half mad With exile, and with brooding on his wrongs, Pausanias, his sage friend, who mounts with him, Could scarce have lighted on a lovelier cure. (I, i, 20-26)9 Hoiderlin's Pausanias also seeks such a "cure" for Empedocles on Etna's slopes: Du brauchst der Pflege, lieber! und es nimmt Der heilge Berg, der vaterliche wohl In seine Ruh die umgetriebnen Gaste. (II, i, 1096-98) Arnold and H6lderlin describe Empedocles in the same key terms: he is a philosopher and a poet; he cannot tolerate the loneliness of the poetic heights, nor can he any longer tolerate the crowded world of men, and for this reason his exile is ultimately self-imposed; he con- ceives of himself as pre-eminently mind (Geist); he has lost the "nat- ural joy" (Glick) of youth, and now his principal goal in life, or rather in death, is to experience the more pervasive joy (Freude, Wonne) of transcendent unity and harmony. Since character and situation are introduced indirectly in the open- ing scene (H6lderlin: Delia and Panthea; Arnold: Callicles and Pau- sanias), both poets are able to turn directly to the philosophical issues with the entrance of Empedocles. His opening monologue in H6lder- lin's drama is not in the traditional mode (whereby the hero simply introduces himself ad spectatores), nor is it a psychological deliberation (such as Hamlet's "To be or not to be ... "), but is delivered as a phil- osophical analysis of Empedocles' own conflict (I, iii, 280-348) .10 As a short preparation to Empedocles' long philosophical statement, Arnold has Pausanias pester Empedocles for the secret of Panthea's cure: Let us rest here; and now, Empedocles, Pantheia's history! (I, ii, 7-8) 9 The Poetical Works of Matthew Arnold, ed. C. B. Tinker and H. F. Lowry (London, 1961), p. 407. All quotations from Arnold's Empedocles are documented in the text with the act, scene, and verse numbers given in this edition. 10 Simtliche Werke (1961), IV-1, 339. 26</page><page sequence="4">HOLDERLIN AND ARNOLD Instruct me of Pantheia's story, Master, As I have pray'd thee. (I, ii, 20-21) Holderlin also refers to Panthea's miraculous recovery, borrowing from Diogenes Laertius,"1 through the dialogue of Panthea herself (I, i, 46 if.) and of her father, Kritias (I, vi, 781 ff.); H6lderlin, too, has Pausanias pester Empedocles to reveal his secrets: Warum Verbirgst du mirs, und machst dein Leiden mir Zum Rathsel? glaube! schmerzlicher ist nichts. (I, iv, 463-465) Was ? um eines Wortes willen ? Wie kannst so du verzagen, kiihner Mann? (I, iv, 485-486) Holderlin's Empedocles replies: "O ehre, was du nicht verstehst!" Arnold's Empedocles uses this occasion to give his first definition of mind: Mind is the spell which governs earth and heaven. Man has a mind with which to plan his safety: Know that, and help thyself! (I, ii, 27-29) H6lderlin's Empedocles defines mind in the same terms: "Es ist der Geist wodurch der Mensch sich retten kann"; but he also tells Pau- sanias: Doch als der Geist mir bliihte, wie du selber bliihst, Da kannt' ich dich, da rief ich es: du lebst, Und wie du heiter wandelst um die Sterblichen, Und himmlischjugendlich den holden Schein Von dir auf jedes eigen iiberstralst, DaB alle deines Geistes Farbe tragen, So ward auch mir das Leben zum Gedicht. (I, iv, 382-89) M/ind here for Holderlin, in contrast to Arnold's definition, is the means of attaining sympathetic union. But, despite this philosophical difference, their descriptive approach to mind is remarkably similar. As Arnold compares mind to the power of magic spells, so Holderlin comlpares mind to the power of myth: "der Geist / Sich kraftiger denn alle Sage fiihlt" (II, iv, 1599-1600). Holderlin's concept of mind, of course, affirms those qualities of transcendence which in Arnold's poem are questioned even up to the moment of dramatic climax. Through mind, life could be elevated, for Holderlin's Empedocles, to poetry; for Arnold's Emepocles, mind is severed from life: 11 Yonge, p. 365. 27</page><page sequence="5">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE But no, this heart will glow no more; thou art A living man no more, Empedocles! Nothing but a devouring flame of thought- But a naked, eternally restless mind! To the elements it came from Everything will return- Our bodies to earth, Our blood to water, Heat to fire, Breath to air. They were well born, they will be well entomb'd- But mind? ... (II, 327-38) Empedocles emphasizes this crucial question again: But mind, but thought- If these have been the master part of us- Where will they find their parent element? (II, 345-47) Mind, as Arnold defines it here, always hinders a union with the abso- lute; Empedocles may "clasp and feel the All" only through the "forms, and modes, and stifling veils" of mind (II, 353-54). Empedocles' awareness of this opposition finally leads him to conclude that mind's "ineffable longing" for harmonious joy will be "Baffled for ever," that he will remain "homeless" and repelled by the elements: Over the unallied unopening earth, Over the unrecognising sea; while air Will blow us fiercely back to sea and earth, And fire repel us from its living waves. (II, 360-63) H6lderlin's Empedocles, in the third draft, is certain that the "ineffable longing" ("das geheimere Verlangen") will be ultimately satisfied, that he will find harmony in "die heiligen Elemente": An seinen vesten Ufern wallt und ruht Das alte Meer, und das Gebirge steigt Mit seiner Str6me Klang, es woogt und rauscht Sein griiner Wald von Thai zu Thal hinunter. Und oben weilt das Licht, der Aether stillt Den Geist und das geheimere Verlangen. Hier wohnen ruhig wir! (I, ii, 96-102) Nevertheless, like Arnold, Holderlin has also chosen, in his original concept of the drama, to portray Empedocles as stripped bare and repelled by the elements: 28</page><page sequence="6">HOLDERLIN AND ARNOLD Die Quelle, die uns trankt, gebiihrt dir nicht Und nicht die Feuerflamme, die uns frommt, Und was den Sterblichen das Herz erfreut, Das nehmen die heilgen Racheg6tter von dir. Fur dich ist nicht das heitre Licht hier oben, Nicht dieser Erde Grin und ihre Frucht, Und ihren Seegen giebt die Luft dir nicht, Wenn deine Brust nach Kiihlung seufzt und diirstet. (I, iv, 633-40) 12 Still he is not troubled with Arnoldian doubt; the individual mind does find its parent element in universal mind; the "stifling veil" will be lifted from the divine All: Denn anders ziemt es nicht fiir ihn, vor dem In todesfroher Stund am heilgen Tage Das GSttliche den Schleier abgenworfen- Den Licht und Erde liebten, dem der Geist, Der Geist der Welt den eignen Geist erwekte, In dem sie sind, zu dem ich sterbend kehre. (II, iv, 1770-75)13 A very similar passage also occurs in the final draft of Em pedokles auf dem A'tna; again, as in Arnold, mind is described as restraining man, concealing him from the All: O du mir wohlbekant, du zauberische Furchtbare Flamme! wie so stille wohnst Du da und dort, wie scheuest du dich selbst Und fliehest dich, du Seele des Lebendigen! Lebendig wirst du mir und offenbar, Mir birgst du dich, gebundner Geist, nicht linger, Mir wirst du helle, denn ich ffircht es nicht. (I, i, 52-58) The "helle Geist" of these last lines as well as the exultant "meine Seele gliiht," and the joyous cry: "Aber freudig quilt / Aus muthger Brust die Flamme" (II, vi, 1931-32), seem to be echoed by Arnold's Empedocles in that final moment of resurgent joy: -Ah, boil up, ye vapours! Leap and rear, thou sea of fire! My soul glows to meet you. (II, 410-12) 12 This idea of repulsion by the elements occurs in the fragments of Empedocles: "For the mighty Air drives him into the Sea, and the Sea spews him forth on the dry Earth; Earth tosses him into the beams of the blazing Sun, and he flings him back to the eddies of the Air. One takes him from the other, and all reject him" (Fragment 115), Burnet, p. 222. 13 Siidtliche Werke (1961), IV-1, 352, Holderlin's marginal note in the manu- script labels these lines a "Hauptstelle." 29</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Empedocles, in both dramas, seeks a joy to be gained only in tran- scending the barrier of mind, a joy which he experiences at the brink of death. Prior to this climactic moment of joy, Empedocles has felt himself enslaved. In Arnold's words, he has been a "slave of thought" (II, 391 ),14 but he has always been aware of the nature of his bondage: I have lived in wrath and gloom Fierce, disputatious, ever at war with man, Far from my own soul, far from warmth and light. But I have not grown easy in these bonds- But I have not denied what bonds these were. (II, 394-98) Holderlin's Empedocles also describes this hopeless bondage of mind which is unable to experience joy: ist doch Das Bleiben, gleich dem Strome den der Frost Gefesselt. Thoricht Wesen! schlaft und halt Der heilge Lebensgeist denn irgendwo, Daf3 du ihn binden mochtest, du den Reinen? Es angstiget der Immerfreudige Dir niemals in Gefangnissen sich ab, Und zaudert hoffnungslos auf seiner Stelle. (II, v, 1892-99) The curse of "Das Bleiben," of continuing a life of bondage, is ines- capable; he must remain either in exiled loneliness, or among the oppressing crowds. Holderlin's Empedocles reflects upon this loneli- ness in his opening monologue: Du sollst Zufrieden werden, armer Geist, Gafangener! sollst frei und groB und reich In eigner Welt dich fiihlen- Und wieder einsam, weh! und wieder einsam? Weh! einsam! einsam einsam! (I, ii, 337-42)15 There was a time, Empedocles recalls, when he lived in harmony with a nature which was nourished by air alone ("sate / ... der Aether," I, iii, 291-92), when the breath of "stiller Aether" was a healing balm to a soul oppressed by the confusion of mortals. ("Sterblichen Irrsal," I, iii, 327-29). Now, however, he finds the abusive restraining bonds 14 Cf. Arnold (II, 248-49); Youth had not yet "grown / Thought's slaves." 15 Quoted from the second draft; the whole speech, however, was rewritten from the opening monologue of the first draft, which did not make use of the images of bondage. 30</page><page sequence="8">HOLDERLIN AND ARNOLD ("schmaihlichenge Bande") intolerable, and he cries out for air: "Luft will ich / Mir schaffen, ha!" (I, iii, 317-18).16 Arnold, in the opening monologue of Act II, has Empedocles voice this same dilemma: "Thou canst not live with men nor with thyself" (II, 23). And again the unendurable solitude is expressed in the image of thirst for air: The air is thin, the veins swell, The temples tighten and throb there- Air! Air! (II, 215-17) But should he flee "back to men," there the tormenting confusion, the constant "chatter at his ear," would rob him of his individuality. No escape is possible; if he returns to the heights of solitude, "he will find its air too keen for him," and thus "Be miserably bandied to and fro / . . . and only death / Can cut his oscillations short, and so / Bring to him poise. There is no other way" (II, 226-34). Empedocles had once experienced joy--before "outward things were closed and dead to us" (II, 241). Significantly, as Arnold de- scribes the youthful sense of "poise" or "balance" now recalled by Em- pedocles, he refers to it as "natural joy" (II, 243, 249), distinguished from the mature search for joy as union, harmony, and wholeness. Likewise, Holderlin differentiates between the higher, transcendental joy (Freude, Wonne) and the natural joy (Gluick) of Empedocles' youth: "ihr Garten meiner Jugend / Und meines Gliiks (II, iv, 1482- 83). But this joy of youth is lost, and Empedocles is left "with no minute's breathing space allow'd / To nurse his dwindling faculty of joy." Indeed, Arnold's Empedocles twice laments (II, 274-75, 321-22) that age has made him dead to joy, just as Holderlin's Empedocles laments: "wie aus krakem Korper sehnt der Geist / Von Agrigent sich aus dem alten Gleise" (II, iv, 1535-36). Confronting death as the only possible alternative to the intolerable vacillation between a poet's loneliness and a civic life among the masses, Empedocles ceremoniously renounces the symbols of these two ex- tremes-the poet's laurel and the ruler's crown. The laurel wreath, the garland of the mythical Delphian poet Apollo, who had slain Pytho and usurped his kingdom,'7 is renounced by Arnold's Empedocles after he has listened to Callicles sing of Apollo's triumph over Marsyas: 16 Cf. Holderlin (II, iv, 1782-89): "Denn heilig ist mein End' und schon- o Luft, / Luft... Schon athmet liebender die Brust ihm auf / Und sein gealtert Angesicht verklart / Erinnerung der ersten Wonne wieder !" 17 This story is recounted by Empedocles in Arnold's drama (II, 201 ff.): H6lderlin refers to the legend of Pythia, priestess of Apollo at Delphi (II, iv, 1705 ff.). 31</page><page sequence="9">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE And lie thou there, My laurel bough! Scornful Apollo's ensign, lie thou there! Though thou hast been my shade in the world's heat- Though I have loved thee, lived in honouring thee- Yet lie thou there, My laurel bough! (II, 191-97) Arnold's Empedocles lays his laurel aside with reluctance and weari- ness; H6lderlin's Empedocles performs the same act with a tone of defiance and pride: Und es reif3t Die delphische Krone mir kein BeBrer Denn ich vom Haupt, und nimmt die Loken hinweg Wie es dem kahlen Seher gebuhrt- (I, iii, 345-48) The civic crown is also abandoned in both dramas, but here there are fewer differences in character and mood. Arnold again has Empedocles speak in response to Callicles' song, this time the story of Zeus' tri- umph over Typho. Zeus represents, as Empedocles interprets the myth, the new order of "littleness united"; Typho, the "brave, impetuous heart," representative of the "Great qualities" of the former age, is imprisoned in Etna. Empedocles recognizes in this myth his own plight; he is alienated from the new generation and alone on the edge of the same crater. In despondency, he no longer wishes to bear the obliga- tions of civic responsibility: I am weary of it. -Lie there, ye ensigns Of my unloved preeminence In an age like this! Among a people of children, Who throng'd me in their cities, Who worshipp'd me in their houses, And ask'd, not wisdom, But drugs to charm with, But spells to mutter- All the fool's-armoury of magic!-Lie there, My golden circlets My purple robe! (II, 108-20) The circumstances are the same in Holderlin's drama, not merely in the theme of exile from Agrigentum and seclusion on Etna,18 but also in Empedocles' sense of weariness and his disappointment in the new 18 Yonge, p. 365. 32</page><page sequence="10">HOLDERLIN AND ARNOLD generation. And so he rejects the civic crown: "DiB ist die Zeit der K6nige nicht mehr" (II, iv, 1449). The price of such a crown, Emped- ocles feels, could be paid only with the ultimate sacrifice of his own individuality; "Ihr botet / Mir eine Kron', ihr Manner! nimmt von mir / Dafiir mein Heiligtum" (II, iv, 1498-1500).19 The similarity does not end here; H6lderlin's Empedocles also criticizes his people as children2Â°1 who have foolishly appealed to a power which they have not the wisdom to understand: O Wiinsche! Kinder seid ihr, und doch wollt Ihr wissen, was begreiflich ist und recht, Du irrest! sprecht, ihr Thirigen, zur Macht21 Die machtger ist, denn ihr, doch hilft es nicht. (II, iv, 1647-50) In dramatizing his despondency, both H6lderlin and Arnold have Empedocles reflect upon his own weariness and the weariness of the stars. The star imagery represents, as well, a sort of universal mind- also barren of joy. Empedocles permits himself the fancy that his per- sonal dilemma is shared in the history of the stars. In Holderlin's drama, Emipedocles first recalls former nights of serenity: wenn iiber mir Die schone Welt sich iffnet, und die heilge Luft Mit ihren Sternen alien als ein Geist Voll freudiger Gedanken mich umfieng, Da wurd es oft lebendiger in mir; (II, iv, 1501-05) The stars remain, Empedocles adds, among the noble powers ("edeln Krafte," (II, iv, 1551-52); he then associates, however, the image of the sinking stars with the end of his own life: "mit des Lebens Stern hinab !" (II, iv, 1614).22 But he realizes the fallacy of his own fancy; the stars are deathless and eternal: l9 Sdimliche Werke (1961), IV-1, 349. This great legacy of Empedocles ex- presses Holderlin's own doctrine of the poet's need to sacrifice himself in his effort to communicate to his age. 20 Were it not for the similarity of their criticism of "a people of children," it might seem that Arnold developed the renunciation scenes independently of I-olderlin, for not only do such scenes have an established tradition in Eng- lish as well as German literature, but Diogenes Laertius also includes the re- port that Empedocles "constantly refused sovereign power when it was offered him" and mentions, too, that Empedocles wore "a Delphian garland." See Yonge, pp. 363, 367. 21 Holderlin's syntax is confusing here: for "Du irrest! sprecht, ihr Thorigen, zur Macht," read "Die Torigen sprechen zur Macht: 'Du irrest!'" 22 Sditliche Werke (1961), IV-1, 350. "Hier denkt Empedokles under dem Bilde eines Sternenuntergangs an das nahe bevorstehende Ende seines Lebens." 33</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE und siegend wirkt durch alle Zeiten Beseeligend hinab sein himmlisch Feuer. (II, iv, 1632-33) In H6lderlin's drama, Empedocles' contemplation of the stars is ex- tended intermittently throughout the long speech at the close of Act. II, Scene iv (especially lines 1501-52). Arnold, however, has given the address to the stars a more condensed, more intense form (II, 276-305). First, Empedocles imagines that the stars, like himself, once "moved joyfully / Amongst august companions / In an older world." Ar- nold's Empedocles, as did Holderlin's, also attributes to the stars the qualities of mind: they are the "radiant, rejoicing, intelligent Sois of Heaven,"23 but now their "lonely, cold-shining lights" must shine upon "a younger, ignoble world." The stars, Empedocles imagines, suffer a weariness like his own. But here (line 301) EImpedocles sud- denly breaks forth from his fanciful revery, perhaps recalling his own earlier condemnation of the anthropomorphic fallacy (I, ii, 272-76); the stars, he knows, are not like him at all: No, no, ye stars! there is no death with you, No languor, no decay! languor and death, They are with me, not you! ye are alive- Ye, and the pure dark ether where ye ride Brilliant above me! (II, 301-05) A significant difference between the two plays is apparent in the portrayal of Empedocles' approach to death. Hollderlin's Empedocles accepts unconditionally the doctrine of the original Empedocles, that there is no cessation in death, but "only a mingling and interchange" ;24 thus his Empedocles confidently anticipates, in the return to the ele- ments, a purifying death and a spiritual rebirth: Doch miissen sie zulezt, Die Angstigen, heraus, und sterbend kehrt Ins Element ein jedes, daB es da Zu neurer Jugend, wie im Bade, sich Erfrische. Menschen ist die groBe Lust Gegeben, daB sie selber sich verjuingen. Und aus dem reinigenden Tode, den Sie selber sich zu rechter Zeit gewahlt, Erstehn, wie aus dem Styx Achill, die V6lker. (II, iv, 1524-32)25 23 Cf. Holderlin's images of stars--flowers: "Ihr Blumen / Des Himmels! sch6ne Sterne, werdet ihr / Denn auch verbiiuhn?" (I, ix, 1017-19); "Es sprechen... Des Himmels Blumen, bliihendes Gestirn, / Und die der Erde tau- sendfach entkeimen" (II, iv, 1625-27). 24 Burnet, p. 206. From Fragment 8. 25 This idea of spiritual rebirth is also linked with the phoenix image of 34</page><page sequence="12">HOLDERLIN AND-ARNOLD Arnold's Empedocles finds in this same doctrine not a comfort, but a curse. What if by transmigration he should return to some even worse bondage or peril? It would be curse enough to endure "the sad pro- bation all again," to try once more to achieve balance in life; but worse is the threat that some new bondage might hold "more peril for us than the last," that in the struggle to escape "we shall sink into impossible strife,26 / And be astray forever" (II, 365-89). Both H1olderlin and Arnold relate transmigration of the soul to their description of Empedocles as a wanderer-a relationship which prob- ably stemmed in turn from two sources: the account of Empedocles' travels in Diogenes Laertius' Lives27 and the idea of purgatorial wan- dering in the fragments of Empedocles.28 H6lderlin's Pausanias de- scribes Empedocles as the "ernsten Wanderer" who forever walks the dark path (II, viii, 1982-83).29 In Arnold's drama, too, Empedocles is an eternal wanderer: I have seen many cities in my time, Till mine eyes ache with the long spectacle, And I shall doubtless see them all again; Thou know'st me for a wanderer from of old. (I, ii, 474-77) Despite the doubt that has tormented him, Arnold's Empedocles remains confident that he has been elected to escape the soulless enslave- ment of death: O ye elements! I know- Ye know it too--it hath been granted me Not to die wholly, not to be all enslaved. (II, 404-06) P6olderlin's Empedocles speaks with the same conviction: Stirb du gemeinen Tod, wie sichs gebuihrt, Am seelenlosen Knechtsgefihl, rnir ist Ein ander Loos beschieden, andern Pfad Weissagtet einst, da ich geboren ward, Ihr Gotter mir, die gegenwartig waren- (II, iv, 1350-54) mind: "Und wenn er stirbt, so flammt aus seiner Asche / Mir heller nur der Genius empor" (II, viii, 2026-27). 20 Cf. The theme of love and strife in the fragments of Empedocles, especially Fragment 17, Burnet, pp. 207-08. 27 Yonge, pp. 365-366. 28 Burnet, p. 222, Fragment 15: "One of these I now am, an exile and a wanderer from the gods, for that I put my trust in insensate strife." 29 Cf. Pausanias' address to Empedocles: "mein Wanderer" (third draft, I, ii, 67 ff.); also the lyrical treatment of Empedocles in the poem, "Der Wan- derer," Gesammelte Werke (Giitersloh, 1954), pp. 208-211. 35</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Death, which is merely physical death, has, then, a powerful attraction, for it not only promises Empedocles a release from his weariness, but it also holds no threat of eternal enslavement. In this fact lies a two- fold problem: philosophically, there is an apparent contradiction between the doctrine of life which Empedocles gives to Pausanias and Empedocles' own choice of death; dramatically, if Empedocles greets death as an emotional escape, then the play fails to achieve true pathos and tragic sublimity. Holderlin and Arnold both sought to resolve this problem by emphasizing in the death of Empedocles a moral triumph. The nature of his moral victory may best be seen in Emnpedocles' relation to the other characters and in his role in the dramatic struc- ture as a whole. There are more differences here than similarities- the most evident difference is the lack of structural unity in Holderlin's drama, a fault not too surprising in a work which was left in fragmen- tary form. Further, HoIderlin's first draft not only is indecisive about the names of a few of the major characters, but also employs a variety of insignificant minor figures (sundry citizens and slaves). Arnold, on the other hand, has limited his characters to three-which makes dramatic development extremely difficult, but is well suited to the poetic and philosophical focus on the character of Empedocles himself. Pausanias' role in both plays is based on Diogenes Laertius' descrip- tion of him as a friend and disciple of Empedocles.30 Holderlin's philo- sophical exposition in Act II, Scene iv and Arnold's long ode in Act I, Scene ii are both addressed to Pausanias, in imitation of the philosophi- cal poem on nature in the fragments of the original Empedocles: "And do thou give ear, Pausanias, son of Anchitos the wise."31 Holderlin also casts Kritias, father of Panthea, in a similar role; like Arnold's Pausanias, Kritias is curious about the magical sources of Empedocles' power, and, again like Arnold's Pausanias, must be counseled to con- tent himself in nature.32 Callicles has no close counterpart in Holderlin's Emnpedocles; he must be considered uniquely Arnold's own. It is Callicles' clear, lyric voice that provides the effective contrast and tension in Arnold's drama. A measure of such contrast and tension is presented, but in a less precise and more rudimentary form, through the choric commentary of Panthea and Delia at the beginning, middle, and end of Holderlin's play.33 The one time in the whole of Arnold's Emtpedocles that Calli- 30 Yonge, p. 362. 31 Burnet, p. 204, Fragment 1. 32 Cf.

At the close of the first scene (lines 133-60), Callicles chides Pausanias for believing that Empedocles had revived Panthea from "a cold trance of death." Bah! Thou a doctor! Thou art superstitious. Simple Pausanias, 'twas no miracle! (I, i, 133-34) Callicles provides the rational explanation of Panthea's recovery, and then adds that Empedocles merely "lets the people, whom he scorns, / Gape and cry wizard at him, if they list." Neither the times nor the sophists are to blame for Empedocles' misery, Callicles continues, but only "Some secret and unfollow'd vein of woe, / Which makes the time look black and sad to him." There is nothing of mythic nature here; Callicles speaks, rather, in the skeptical tone of a rationalist, criticizing Pausanias for being "credulous of fables as a girl." A strange accusation to be made by a character who, for the remainder of the play, speaks only in fables, whose fables are, in fact, identified with truth (II, 89). But if such a speech is out of character for Callicles, it is very much in character for Hemokrates, who at the close of the first scene of H6lderlin's second draft speaks in a similar chiding tone. Indeed, several of the phrases are the same, for Hemokrates, too, ridiculed, "die Abergliiubigen" (lines 237 ff.) who believed Empedo- cles a wizard: "Der, wie ein Zauberer, die Menge leitet" (line 209). Further, says Hemokrates, it is not external circumstance but "sein GeheimniB" which estranges Empedocles: Es wandte zur gelegnen Stunde sich Sein Unmuth um, der stolze stillemporte Sinn Befeindet izt sich selber. (I, i, 214-16) Although Holderlin has no harp player on Etna, he does include in his play a great many metaphoric references to the mythic harp player of nature.a4 And, even without the presence of a Callicles to remind him of his once youthful, poetic nature, H6lderlin's Empedocles still laments his lost sensibility in terms of the harp image: ton's emphasis on the importance of Callicles: "Of the conception of Callicles there can only be the highest praise. Indeed, without it the poem would have been seriously impaired: the action too limited, the tone a little monotonous, and the figure-and meaning-of Empedocles less fully realized."

(3rd Draft, I, ii, 196-99) The name Callicles is apparently Arnold's euphonic abbreviation of Callicratides, a brother of Empedocles, who is mentioned by Diogenes Laertius.35 In character, of course, Callicles is not the brother but is more similar to Scythinos, a poet somewhat younger than Empedocles; it was Schythinos who had written of Apollo's song to Harmonia: "Apollo sang ... holding as a lyre plectrum, a shining ray of sunlight in his hand."36 H6lderlin echoes Scythinos' song of Apollo and his lyre: "wie, goldner T6ne / Voll, der entz{ickende Sonnenjiingling / Sein Abendlied auf himmlischer Leier spielt."37 Mythic nature has an equally pervasive importance in both dramas; again, H6lderlin has only failed to provide its unifying exponent-Callicles. The mythical subjects, so intensively developed in Callicles' songs, are merely scat- tered references in 6-Iolderlin's play. They do not have the dramatic effectiveness that Callicles was able to give them; nevertheless, H6lder- lin does draw from the myths of Apollo and Achilles, even of Typho, of Chiron, of Harmonia.38 Only the tale of the cruel Apollo who flays the satyr Marsyas is missing altogether from 1Hlderlin's drama; this myth was given a lyric expression in an earlier poem, "Dichterberuf."39 Holderlin and Arnold drew from a common heritage of mythical tra- dition. Only a few parallels in the plays may possibly be their own. For example, in their stories of Typho's fall, both poets refer to Typho's heart buried in Etna: 3.

Harmonia: first draft, II, iv, 1847; third draft, I, ii, 327. Harmonia, although still considered the daughter of Aphro- dite, was evidently confused with the Muse Urania, H6lderlin's symbol of divine love and harmony, who is praised in his "Hymne an die Gottin der Harmonie," Gesammelte Werke, pp. 42-45. 39 Gesammelte Werke, pp. 163-164. To have been vanquished by Apollo, how- ever, is for Holderlin an heroic martyrdom: "Das gewaltige Element, das Feuer des Himmels und die Stille der Menschen, ihr Leben in der Natur, und ihre Einge- schranktheit und Zufriedenheit, hat mich bestaindig ergriffen, und wie man Helden nachspricht, kann ich wohl sagen, dal3 mich Apollo geschlagen." Quoted in Benno von Wiese, "Holderlins mythische Tragodie 'Der Tod des Empedokles' und ihre Bedeutung im Rahmen seines Zeitalters," in Die deutsche Tragodie von Lessing bis Hebbel (Hamburg, 1955), pp. 372-373. 38</page><page sequence="16">HOLDERLIN AND ARNOLD To Typho only, the rebel o'erthrown, Through whose heart Etna drives her roots of stone.

(I, ii, 240-42) 4 But it is not in these smaller details that one finds the similarity the strongest; rather it is in the larger response to mythical nature.41 If a description of mythical nature is to be more than mere external orna- mentation, if the mythological elements are to have a structural role, two possibilities are open to the poet: either myth will be developed as an anthropomorphization of nature, or myth will describe the forces of primordial nature. As has been pointed out, Empedocles in both dramas renounces the former possibility as a fallacy; through Callicles, however, Arnold makes use of the latter mode in the same manner as Holderlin.42 The conflicts of hunman nature are described in terms of primordial nature-myth is the idyll of passion and pain.43 Thus Arnold's Empedocles defines the myths of Callicles: "He fables, yet speaks the truth!" (II, 89) ; also for H6lderlin's Empedocles, mythic nature holds the answer to humran destiny: "Und zauberisch in seiner Tiefe l6sten / Sich meine Rathsel auf-" (I, iv, 408-09). In both dramas, then, Empedocles is painfully aware of the relevance of mythic 40 Kranz, p. 379, "DaB unter dem 'schneeigen' Atna selbst, 'im schrecklichen Tartaros der G6tterfeind Typhos liegt,' war Holderlin aus dem Ersten Pythischen Gesang Pindars bekannt. DaB aber Empedokles um 'die Titanen' zu 'versohnen' hinabsteigen kSnnte, ist des Dichters eigener Mythos." 41 Gerhard Miiller-Schwefe, Das personliche Menschenbild Matthewz Arnolds in der dichterischen Gestaltung (Tiibingen, 1955), p. 104. Without considering the Empedocles poems, Miiller-Schwefe states that Holderlin is the German poet who has most successfully combined poetry and myth, attaining a deeper insight into "das Wesen von Welt und Mensch." Since he overlooks the mythi- cal lyric of Arnold's Callicles, Miiller-Schwefe denies Arnold this ability: "Fur ihn [Arnold] bleiben die Elemente aus der Mythologie des klassischen Alter- tums und des Christentums poetische Verkleidung theoretischer Einsichten, die nich zusammengeschaut, sondern mit bewul3ter, die Wirkung berechender Pla- nung eingebaut geworden sind." 42 Miiller-Schwefe, p. 247, refers to the similarity of the imagery of "mythische Landschaft" between Arnold's "The River," "On the Rhein," and "Empedocles on Etna" and Holderlin's "Der Rhein," "Ister," and "Quell der Donau." Surprisingly, Miller-Schwefe does not mention H6lderlin's Empedokles in this comparison. 43 Douglas Bush, Mythology and the Romantic Tradition in English Poetry (New York, 1957), p. 255.

The accuracy of this interpretation of Empedocles' response to mythic nature is given further support in the plans which both Arnold and Holderlin had written for a dramatic poem on Empedocles. In his brief outline, Arnold wrote: He sees things as they are-the world as it is-God as he is: in their stern simplicity. The sight is a severe and mind-tasking one: to know the mysteries which are communicated to others by fragments, in parables.44 And in his essay, "Grund zum Empedokles," Holderlin wrote: Er scheint nach allem zum Dichter geboren, scheint also in seiner subjectiven thatigern Natur schon jene ungewohnliche Tendenz zur Allgemeinheit zu haben, die unter andern Umstianden, oder durch Einsicht und Vermeidung ihres zu starken Einflusses, zu jener ruhigen Betrachtung, zu jener Vollstaiidigkeit und durchgangiger Bestimmtheit des BewuBtseyns wird, womit der Dichter auf ein Ganzes blikt.45 It is evident that both Arnold and Holderlin have set Empedocles apart from other men; he sees nature whole, directly and intensely. He is not like Pausanias; therefore the advice that he has given Pausanias cannot pertain to him. The purpose of the second act in Iolderlin's drama has been summarized by Benno von Wiese as Empedocles' attempt to regain purity through death, which he approaches as an affirmation of being.4G The process of Empedocles' tragic destiny is dramatized through his meditation: "Was der Mensch naiv und kind- lich besaB, verliert er auf der Stufe der Reflexion and muB3 es in einer neuen Erkenntnis wiederfinden."47 This, of course, is equally true of the second act of Arnold's Empedocles. The dramatic technique Arnold himself describes as "the dialogue of mind with itself" ;48 Empedocles had possessed "balance" and "natural joy" in youth, but joy has been obscured by the "forms, and modes, and stifling veils" of mind and thought, and at the brink of the crater, he too, seeks a resurgence of joy. For both authors, the dramatic structure and the response to mythic nature are inseparable; nature is present even in the dramatic climax. Etna itself is addressed by Empedocles as a mythic symbol of the union with the "All": it is, in Arnold's words, "mother earth's miraculous womb," (II, 30), or, as Holderlin expresses it, "die dunkle Mutter" (third draft, line 242). Holderlin's Empedocles achieves in death a 44 C. B. Tinker and H. F.

Even as he stands on the brink of the crater, Empedocles feels released by the passing of the homeless clouds: Indel des Himmels heimatlos Gewolk Das immer fliichtige vorfiber wandelt. Wie ist mir ? staunen muB3 ich noch, als fieng Ich erst zu leben an, denn all ists anders, Und jezt erst bin ich, bin- (II, vi, 1917-21) Arnold makes use of this same image of the passing cloud, as his Empedocles, in the corresponding scene at the crater's edge, feels the restoration of joy: I feel it in this hour. The numbing cloud Mounts off my soul; I feel it, I breathe free. (II, 407-08)49 And, in this moment of joy, Empedocles has resolved to leap into the flames "ere the mists / Of despondency and gloom" return.50 There is a note of doubt, even at this climactic moment of death, and the uncertainty of death is expressed in his final cry to the elements: "Receive me! Save me !" Empedocles leaps into the crater, not out of despair, but to capture his moment of joy. His triumph is not for others, but for himself. His victory, as contrasted with H6lderlin's Empedocles, is the affirmation of self, not of being per se; he dies in the exalta- tion of life and joy, thus to escape the undesirable death of contamina- tion5l by the "younger, ignoble world," which would render him for- ever dead to life and joy.52 Hils triumph is that he has overcome the curse of weariness. This is more important to Arnold's Empedocles than a positive resolution of doubt. 49 The image of the passing cloud also introduces the fourth song of Callicles: "As the sky-brightening south-wind clears the day, / And makes the mass'd clouds roll, / The music of the lyre blows away / The clouds which wrap the soul" (II, 121-24). 50 Houghton, p. 331. "The very thing he thought never to experience again sweeps over him, and in the context of the argument-the wisdom of dying be- fore he sinks once more into a despondency that must soon give the intellect and the world mastery over him, and before he becomes unable to return to his mother earth and share her joyful, creative life-provides the immediate impulse to carry out his resolve." 51 B. von Wiese, p. 370. The climax of Holderlin's play also implies an escape from contamination through "Wiederherstellung des reinen Zustandes durch den als Opfer gedeuteten Tod." 52 Houghton, p. 328. "In short, he would rather die now than live to see his soul, which had been 'fed on other food' and 'trained by other rules than are in vogue today,' infected and destroyed by a new environment that is utterly lacking in moral and spiritual quality." 41</page><page sequence="19">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Holderlin attempted to produce an Hesperian tragedy based on the unity and opposition between man and the universe; his difficulty arose from the lack of dramatic action in what was essentially an intro- spective struggle. Arnold saw the limitations of the material as drama, and emphasized, instead, the poetic treatment of the "dialogue of mind with itself." When Arnold revived his Empedocles, after keeping it from publication for fifteen years, he made clear that it was not intended to be staged: "I restored it for reading only--I would never have re- stored it for representation."53 Through the poetic presentation of Empedocles' tragic situation, and with the lyric contrast of Callicles, Arnold was able to overcome the problems which had hindered H6lder- lin's drama. Arnold was in Germany after the publication of Holderlin's Sdnmt- liche Werzke (1846), but he left no notes on H6lderlin. We know that Arnold's familiarity with German literature was extensive; he wrote on Schiller, Jean Paul, Heine, and many others, and he especially ad- mired Goethe, from whom he often borrowed in his philosophical essays as well as in his poetry.54 These few facts are far from decisive; but, together with the numerous verbal echoes, the many parallel themes and images, and the profound similarity in the entire structure of the two dramas, they corroborate the obvious conclusion: however little known HIolderlin might have been in nineteenth-century England, Arnold was certainly one man who knew him well.
