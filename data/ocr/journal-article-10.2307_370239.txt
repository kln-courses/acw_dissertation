<plain_text><page sequence="1">Responses and Replies (continued) Computers and the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge' H. M. Collins Slezak's premise is that BACON makes scientific discoveries; his conclusion is that this disproves the 'strong programme' and its variants (SSK).2 I believe that if the premise is true the conclusion follows. Social Studies of Science (SAGE, London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), Vol. 19 (1989), 613-24</page><page sequence="2">614 Social Studies of Science In the case of most interpretations of the premise, however, the premise is untrue. Thus, Slezak's conclusion is incorrect. The same applies to all future versions of BACON and its ilk that do not involve unforeseen design principles (no-one can predict the unforeseeable). The reason this is not obvious is that the premise is deeply ambiguous. Slezak does not make clear what he means when he says that BACON 'discovers' things.3 The major ambiguity is between the 'encapsulated collectivity' interpre- tation and the 'human mimic' interpretation. The encapsulated collectivity interpretation is that BACON can do everything that sociologists of scientific knowledge (SSKs) claim to be the prerogative of the community. On this interpretation, BACON's discoveries would disprove all collective theories of discovery such as Brannigan's attributional theory,4 or the 'individual proposes, but society disposes' idea typical of, say, 'the empirical programme of relativism'.5 This is because BACON is not a social collectivity. On this interpretation, Slezak's premise is clearly wrong; I will deal with it in the next section. The 'human mimic' interpretation is more interesting. This interpretation takes it that BACON only does what an 'individual "discoverer"' does.6 Showing that Slezak is wrong on this interpretation leads on to much more general arguments about the relationship between computers and social life which I will look at in the second part of this Response. Discovery Programs as Encapsulated Collectivities SSK aside, the most pervasive modem image of the scientist is a solitary one. It is, of course, this presumed solitude that makes the study of science such a fascinatingly 'hard case' for the sociologically inclined. Above all, the scientist-discoverer is thought of as an isolate because he or she needs to avoid mundane influences if novelty is to be achieved. That, presumably, is why the first supposed computer genius is a scientist rather than an artist, composer or writer. Take the idea of an isolated mechanical scientist seriously. Imagine BACON (or a more powerful version of same) alone on a desert island (supplied with a reliable, wave-powered, generator). Could it reproduce modem science? One immediate difficulty is that BACON cannot do experiments, so let us provide it with the 'data' which it asks for. The trouble now is the meaning of 'data'. Many SSK studies have shown the difficulty of filtering what is to count as proper 'data' from the results of badly designed experiments or</page><page sequence="3">Responses &amp; Replies: Collins: Response to Slezak 615 observations, the results of 'preliminary runs', the results of unspecifi- able error, the results of incompetently managed runs, and so forth. Consider this contemporary reminder. School students of mathematics were asked to determine the relationship between the sides of certain geometrical figures. They were asked to draw arbitrarily-sized versions of the figures, then to measure the sides. By combining the raw data, two pairs of columns of numbers were computed, one by the students, and one by their teacher (see Table 1). Each row of numbers shows the results of the students' and teacher's computations for one of the geometrical figures. The pairs of columns can be seen as tests of competing hypotheses about the relationship between the sides of the figures. A numerical match between column 'Al' and column 'Bi' supports the students' hypothesis, a mismatch reduces its credibility. In the case of columns 'A2' and 'B2', it is the teacher's hypothesis that is at stake. TABLE 1 Students' Teacher's Hypothesis Hypothesis Al Bi A2 B2 Figure 1 131.4 128.4 16.1 15.95 Figure 2 74.0 70.6 12.0 11.6 Figure 3 134.7 130.0 16.4 16.1 Figure 4 39.7 37.7 8.8 8.15 Figure 5 126.8 130.8 15.9 16.1 Figure 6 100.0 98.0 14.0 13.85 Figure 7 157.2 159.3 17.7 17.9 Figure 8 192.3 190.3 19.6 19.7 Figure 9 126.7 123.3 15.9 15.65 Figure 10 151.9 150.5 17.4 17.45 Figure 11 242.2 245.5 22.0 22.55 Figure 12 200.3 205.7 20.0 20.45 Figure 13 194.7 190.0 19.7 19.7 Figure 14 87.9 88.0 13.0 13.55 For the reader, the problem of deciding which of the columns best supports the hypothesis is something like a real scientific problem in so far as the numbers themselves are ambiguous. For example, while the results for figure 14 give more support to the students' hypothesis, figure 13 favours the teacher. Statistics might help to determine which row best fits its underlying hypothesis on the assumption of randomly distributed</page><page sequence="4">616 Social Studies of Science error but, given non-random experimental error, it is not possible to determine which is correct from the numbers. Now, the left-hand columns are the outcome of a standard, real-life classroom demonstration of Pythagoras's Theorem. Students were asked to draw triangles, measure their sides, and compute their squares and relevant sums. In the test of the students' hypothesis column 'Al' is the result of calculating 'a2 +b2', while column 'B1' is the result of calculat- ing 'c2'. The correspondence between the numbers in the two columns is taken in the classroom to 'demonstrate' Pythagoras's Theorem. The right-hand columns are also based on the students' measurements but are not usually part of the exercise. The teacher calculated 'a+b' to produce column 'A2', while the figures in column 'B2' are '1.5c- 1'. The crucial point is the difference between a retrospective demonstra- tion, and the same 'experiment' seen as a real-time determination of a mathematical relationship. At best the figures can be taken to demonstrate Pythagoras's Theorem only after the universe of possibilities has been narrowed to the binary choice between Pythagoras and not-Pythagoras - all competitors such as 'a + b =1. 5c -1' must already have been eliminated. In real life and real time, those processes happen within the social collectivity. 7 Now, there are periods when competing collectivities cleave to different interpretations of data. When our imaginary isolated BACON asks for data - on, say, the charge on suspended oil drops,8 the angle by which light-rays are bent by the Sun,9 the flux of cosmic gravitational radiation detectable on the surface of the earth, 0 or the sensitivity of living plants to human emotion,11 whose numbers should be provided? The choice seems to lie between giving it the data which fits best with current thinking, or providing all versions and allowing BACON itself to decide between them (and the many other interpretations of the numbers which are available). In the former case, the machine is not really isolated from society at all. The human social collectivity has made its presence felt in filtering the data - and thus predetermining the results (and this, I presume, is how the actual BACON works). In the latter case it is not at all clear that BACON will reproduce the history of science. It may plump for interpretations of the data which are different to those which we chose. The data and the machine cannot solve these problems by themselves. In the latter case, it is hard to know what criteria BACON would use to choose an interpretation and a solution. In such a case BACON would have to do everything that is involved in bringing a controversy to a close. In this sense, it would come close to reproducing society - the strongest</page><page sequence="5">Responses &amp; Replies: Collins: Response to Slezak 617 claim that Slezak could make for a discovering machine. But in these circumstances we would expect one BACON given a set of data to provide one solution, while another BACON, given the same data, would come up with another solution. Given the same data, one BACON, whose program had reached the early years of this century, would believe in integral electric charges, while another would believe that the unit of charge could be divided indefinitely; one BACON would believe in general relativity, while another would find the Eddington data too ambiguous to be decisive. As for BACONs which had reached the early nineteen-seventies, there would be some that thought that high fluxes of gravity waves could be detected on the surface of the earth, and others that did not; some that believed in ESP and others that were so incensed at the claims that they would ask us to form a 'Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Claims of the Paranormal' in order to root out this unbelievable data. That is what one must expect of a machine that reproduces scientific society - and it is hard to see how it would be programmed. Discovery Programmes as Scientist-Mimics It is because it is so hard to see how to program a machine to reproduce scientific society that we are entitled to claim that future BACONs will do no better than the current BACON as isolated discoverers. Of course, someone may find out how to do it - one cannot prophesy - but they will not do it using the design principles that go into the current genera- tions of discovering machines. Something unforeseeable will have to happen, and there is little point in talking about it. Perhaps it is the very idea of an isolated discovery machine that is incoherent. Perhaps society is integral to the notion of discovery. The more modest claim, that BACON mimics individual scientists' contributions to discovery, is neither incoherent nor obviously false. This is a more difficult proposition altogether, and one that is potentially much more damaging. If it were true, the damage would not only be to versions of SSK, but to any idea of a social science which takes social collectivities as the primary unit of analysis. 12 These approaches take human abilities to exist by virtue of membership of social collectivities. If machines could mimic human action it would disprove the basic tenet because machines are not part of social collectivities. I will start to discuss this issue by considering discovery as a special case, and then move on to the more general problem.</page><page sequence="6">618 Social Studies of Science Let us first go back to claims made for simpler machines than BACON. There are expert systems that do 'machine induction'.13 That is, given a set of observed regularities, they 'induce' a novel relationship to explain them. Engineers have told me that their automated induction programs have given them surprises and taught them new ways of looking at the world. This kind of idea has been with us a long time. In concept it is no different to the statistical technique used by psychologists and known as 'factor analysis'. A factor analysis program takes many statistical relationships and works out how to group them in a way that will give a regular cluster. For example, it is said that there are measures of abstract reasoning, numerical proficiency and verbal ability that cluster together with sufficient regularity to be worth describing by the single factor known as 'intelligence'. Intelligence is, in a sense, a 'discovery' made by a statistical procedure. It might equally well have been made by machine induction or some other type of 'discovering' program. Now, the history of the notion of intelligence tells us that what this program has done cannot be what we mean by discovery; we are still arguing about whether intelligence is a sensible description for the sum of these different measures. We are still arguing about whether intelligence is something like c2 or something like 1.5c -1. We are scornful of the larger claims of BACON not because we do not believe that it can come up with general relationships, but because we do not believe that it could come up with just those relationships that, in the case of human 'discovery', emerged only after long and ugly historical processes (processes that are as yet incomplete in the case of the notion of intelli- gence). But given this, in what way are BACON, automated induction machines, and factor analysis programs (hereafter BACON et al) less good at discovery than isolated scientists stuck away in remote locations? To understand one part of the problem it is important to notice that there is nothing to stop a human being behaving like a well-programmed machine. Given some assistance with the selection of data, BACON et al can take the place of humans who mimic machines. For example, factor analysis programs do just what some psychologists would do themselves if only they were better with a pencil and paper; they 'trawl the data'. This is what most of us think of as unimaginative 'discovery' work. For most individuals, however isolated, there is more to 'discovery' than data-trawling and statistical induction.14 The 'more' is the ability to anticipate the social nexus into which the potential discovery will be cast. For example, human 'discoverers' have to decide how to present their work - as continuous with what already exists, or as a revolutionary breakthrough. 15 To do this the potential 'discoverer' has to be in touch</page><page sequence="7">Responses &amp; Replies: Collins: Response to Slezak 619 with social life - he or she must know what it is to follow a rule and what it is to break a rule in contemporary society. The calculus of risk and ridicule, the calculus of possibility, depends not on what relationships can be extracted from the data, but on how different interpretations of the numbers will be received. In 1912, Millikan's oil drop experiment did not have one-third and two-third charges as presentable results even though they were 'there in the data'. Such results only became a potential discovery much later (with the free quark hypothesis), and only for a short time. No current or foreseeable machine could tell the difference between what might make a sensible discovery, what might make a risky 'discovery', and what would make a non-'discovery'. The answers to these questions are to be found in society, not in the data. The difference between a 'discoverer' and one who 'trawls data' is in the different degree of connectedness with, and anticipation of, scien- tific society. That a program like BACON can work at all has to be explained by the way it is connected into society by its users. BACON does just a very little mechanical part that fits into the complex social process of discovery. Without noticing it, we do all the rest. The same applies to the social interactions of far less 'intelligent' machines. But machines themselves can do that part of discovery that lies at the centre of what is done by humans who confuse science with trawling data. The Future of Intelligent Machines in The Past of Intelligent Machines It is difficult to take the argument much further if we are only to consider BACON and the future of BACON-like programs. So far we have considered early discovery programs. It could be argued that future BACONs will be put in better touch with the social collectivity through their programs. For each potential new BACON there is a potential new Slezak ready to say that even if BACONn -, when subject to close examination, didn't really do more than trawl data, BACONn+I really will anticipate what would count as a potential discovery without too much help from its users. It seems to me that such a program would have to share our forms-of-life, for how else would it know what counts as a creative way to break a rule? But to deal with the question empirically we would have to deal with all new versions of BACON and all new versions of Slezak; this could take a very long time. Fortunately there is no need to wait so long. We can imagine a less timid Slezak who would point out that all variants of social thinking that</page><page sequence="8">620 Social Studies of Science take the social collectivity as the primary location of activity had already been disproved by the existence of the earliest computers long before the advent of BACON; if human action is essentially collective then a computer, which is not part of our social life, should not be able to act. The earliest computers could do arithmetic, yet determined Wittgen- steinians include even arithmetic among essentially social activities. For example, they point out that the rules for continuing a series are not exhaustively stateable - they just have to be known. We just know that in certain circumstances the correct continuation of 2, 4, 6, 8, is '10, 12, 14, 16' while in others it is 'who do we appreciate!'. We just know that when we are told the rule for continuing the sequence within the arithmetical context is 'add two' that means produce '10' for the next term, rather than '82' or '28' or '8 two'. But if all this is true, how does my pocket calculator - which is not a social being - participate in my arithmetical form-of-life? This is a serious problem. If, however, we can solve it for the 'hard case' of arithmetic we will not need to worry too much about discovery programs. The problem of arithmetic (and its equivalents) can be solved. Closely considered, it turns out that computers do not do arithmetic. What they do is related to arithmetic in the same way as data-trawling is related to discovery. Pocket calculators (or mainframe computers) do just that little bit of arithmetic which we would normally do by procedures equivalent to rote learning and rote reproduction.16 Consider this sum: 'If I am 5ft 9in tall, and there are 2.54cm to the inch, how tall am I in centimetres?' The answer, according to my calculator, is 175.26 centimetres (69x2.54). But, if someone says to me, how tall are you in centimetres, I do not reply 'one-hundred-and- seventy-five-point-two-six centimetres', I reply, 'one-hundred-and- seventy-five centimetres'. The un-approximated figure is not the answer to the question. To give the right answer one must know the use of the calculation within the rest of social existence. It involves knowing the social agreements about what constitutes a correct calculation. Thus it involves knowing how exact to make a calculation, knowing when to give a rough answer even if a more exact one is available, and knowing whether, and how, to make a rough calculation when it is not possible to make an exact one even if an exact one would be better. It involves knowing when a slide-rule, a calculator, an abacus, a ready-reckoner, logarithm tables and pencil and paper are counted as doing the 'same' thing and when they are not. 17 One might say that the calculator does the exoskeleton of the act of calculation - I do the rest. Even in what one might think of as the 'straightforward' parts of</page><page sequence="9">Responses &amp; Replies: Collins: Response to Slezak 621 arithmetic, the calculator can make the sort of mistakes that humans would never make. For example, a simple calculator, given the sum '7 divided by 11, multiplied by 11 ', produces the answer '6.9999996'. In the same way, '10/3 x 3' produces '9.9999999'. These problems arise because the calculator does the sums strictly according to the sequence in which they are presented (so it runs into rounding problems). Socialized humans would order the sequence of operations by reference to the anticipated answer - something we know by virtue of our social experience. Though scientific calculators are more likely to have rounding programs that will get simple sums right, the problem is a deep one that cannot be fully solved by 'hacking' round it. Even my University's mainframe is vulnerable to simple errors. For example, given the sum 7/1l x 11 (expressed in BASIC), the mainframe provides the correct answer '7'. But the program has the ability to work more accurately in what is called 'double precision'. The same sum, done more accurately by the computer in double precision, produces the answer 6.99999988079071. In this example, what is more accurate for the arithmetician is less accurate for the computer, and vice-versa. Of course, even in double precision, the computer was well able to handle the problem if the multiplication was done first, showing that in double precision mode it did not have the capacity to see '7 x 11/11 ' and '7/11 x 11' as the 'same' sum. (If we wanted to be theoretical about this, we might say that the law of commutativity had broken down at this point.) Of course, it would not be hard to write little 'hacks' that would cope with these particular deficiencies now that they have been mentioned; a little routine could be written for the computer to be able to spot when things could be 'cancelled' without having to be evaluated. But such a process could never put the computer in a position to anticipate all, as yet unforeseen, opportunities to cancel (or otherwise simplify) in more complex formulae - this is the job of mathematicians. Mathematicians will always be seeking and finding 'rigorous' solutions to problems that are currently done by approximate, numerical, methods. The answer to the less timid Slezak, who would confront all neo- Wittgensteinian approaches to social analysis with the existence of computers, is that computers just do not do what humans do.18 If this is easy to demonstrate within the realm of knowledge where computers reign supreme - the 'hard case' of arithmetic - then discovery goes by default.</page><page sequence="10">622 Social Studies of Science Conclusion Slezak's premise, that BACON makes discoveries, is ambiguous. If it is taken to mean that BACON reproduces social collectivities then, if true, it would be fatal for 'the strong programme' and its variants. On this interpretation, however, the premise is obviously false. A more modest but potentially much more damaging interpretation of Slezak's premise is that BACON and its ilk reproduce the role of the individual within the social process of discovery. If true, this would be fatal to all approaches to social science which rest on the social collectivity as the primary unit of analysis. This is because BACON's putative abilities in the field of discovery are equivalent to the abilities of existing computers in many fields - such as arithmetic - and if an isolated computer can do what is claimed to be the exclusive preserve of socialized beings, then the preserve cannot be so exclusive after all. Luckily, the general implication of this claim makes it possible to test it by looking at more than discovery programs. It can be tested by looking at any other machine that appears, on the surface, to do the same job as socialized human beings. It turns out on closer examination that machines such as the calculator only make the same contribution to the collective activity of arithmetic as a human when the human's contribution is rote repro- duction of what has been learned mechanically. This is only a small part of arithmetic, prone to a variety of errors. Given this insight it is easy to see that discovery programs' contribution to discovery is of the same order. Postscript In his contribution to this Symposium Steve Woolgar pleads for an end to this sterile debate.19 He suggests that the debate be transcended and that instead of endless argument and counter-argument we move to a new level of understanding. I think Steve has been too modest here, and that he should apply his insight more widely. I believe that all debates should immediately move to a higher plane; all debates should be transcended and all debaters should move immediately to positions they would otherwise not take up for many years. Why waste all this time getting from here to there when we can get there right now? All we need, in this debate as well as others, is examples of how to get there. So far Steve has not shown us how to transcend debate, only how to infrascend it.</page><page sequence="11">Responses &amp; Replies: Collins: Response to Slezak 623 * NOTES 1.

This exercise was undertaken by Judy Palmer, a teacher of mathematics, as part of her assignment for my 'sociology of scientific knowledge' unit on her Master of Education course at the University of Bath. She was asked to reconsider one of her typical mathematics lessons in the light of recent work in the philosophy and sociology of science, and point out ways in which its pedagogical force rested on the alternative interpretations of the material being hidden or ignored. I am grateful to Ms Palmer for allowing me to use the material. 8. I refer, of course, to Holton's analysis of Millikan's notebooks: G. Holton, The Scientific Imagination (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978). Though Franklin has shown that re-analysis of Millikan's data taking advantage of all his readings does not make a decisive difference, the point of principle remains. Ehrenhaft, we may be sure, would have read Millikan's uninterpreted notebooks differently to Millikan and Franklin. 9. See J. Earman and C.

We must be careful to qualify 'isolated' by remembering that isolated scientists do not live on desert islands - they must be in touch with scientific society just as factor analysis programs are put in touch with society by the psychologists who enter the data. 15. For example, see T. J. Pinch, Confronting Nature: The Sociology of Solar-Neutrino Detection (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1986) and G. D. L. Travis, 'Replicating Replication? Aspects of the Social Construction of Learning in Planarian Worms', Social Studies of Science, Vol. 11 (1981), 11-32. 16. Exactly what rote learning and reproduction is, is an interesting question. I deal with it at length in my forthcoming book. 17. Using a calculator is itself quite a skilful matter. Knowing what to enter and how to key it in is not obvious. For example, a student of mine, returning to learning after a long absence, had the following sum to do on a pocket calculator: '251 x - 1.6'. She produced the answer '249.4'. This is what you will get if you type in the symbols in sequence. In practice, to use a calculator properly, one must know how to check the answer roughly. This requires a lot of arithmetical skill - in an interesting sense, doing the sum roughly takes more skill than doing it exactly. I expand the example at length in my forthcoming book. 18. Note that my argument is exactly contrary to the trend of recent French analysis of science and technology.
