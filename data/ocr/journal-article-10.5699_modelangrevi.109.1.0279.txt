Aby Warburg (–), the art historian whose Kulturwissenschaliche Bib- liothek, founded in , later migrated to London as the Warburg Institute, is an important figure for the study of cultural memory. He was especially interested in how Pathosformeln, visual formulae expressing intense emotion, were adapted from their pagan origins during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. He increas- ingly saw art as helping to liberate humanity from primeval fears by transforming images, as when the ancient Saturnian demon is humanized as Dürer’sMelencolia, and as providing a symbolic dimension that saves us from confronting too directly the nakedly factual universe revealed by science. Memory, as E. H. Gombrich explains in Aby Warburg: An Intellectual Biography (nd edn (London: Phaidon, ), pp. –), thus has a dual role in preserving the mythic images into which early humanity projected their terrors while locating these images within our law-governed universe. But progress is not inevitable: the past holds out the lure of atavism, and primitive violence can always return. Christopher Johnson deals with an ambitious project in cultural memory which was unfinished at Warburg’s death. is was his Mnemosyne, consisting of sixty- three wooden boards to which Warburg attached photographs of images, in order to illustrate the changes undergone by images of the Greek gods and by ancient Pathosformeln. e panels no longer survive, but the  photographs that make up the third version of this Bilderatlas, as Warburg also called it, have been published in Volume /i of Warburg’sGesammelte Schrien, edited byMartinWarnke (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, ). ese juxtaposed images invite comparison with moder- nist montage and particularly with Walter Benjamin’s unfinished Passagen-Werk. Although Johnson’s dense, rich, oen digressive book defies summary, it is centrally concerned with Mnemosyne as a work of cultural memory based not on metonymy, like modernist montages, but on metaphor. Its implicit history of culture moves from primitive anthropomorphism to modern abstraction, but with no sense of triumphant progression, for Warburg deplored not only a relapse into primitive terror but also any advance into sterile abstraction. For him, metaphor served to create distance from experience and hence a Denkraum or intermediate space of reflection. He feared that in modern machine civilization such inventions as the telephone and the telegraph impoverished life by abolishing such distance. Warburg’s Denkräume recollect the past in the form of visual metaphors which preserve intense emotions with sensuous immediacy but also with reflective dis- tance. us the tragic scene in Dürer’s Death of Orpheus moves us without over- whelming us. Warburg identified his Pathosformeln with the ‘engrams’ or ‘mnemic </page> <page sequence="2">  Reviews traces’ hypothesized by the zoologist Richard Semon in . In turn, they helped to inspire Ernst Robert Curtius’s concept of ‘topoi’ or literary commonplaces handed down through the centuries. Warburg also borrowed a term from Goethe in calling his formulae ‘Urworte leidenschalicher Dynamik’ (quoted by Johnson, p. ). Although Johnson’s large claims for the supreme importance of metaphor to Warburg may not altogether convince, he does much both to illuminate the Mnemosyne project and to place Warburg in the larger context of philosophi- cal and critical thinking about metaphor. He suggests an affinity with Vico, for whom poetry and reflection originate with metaphor, and with thinkers indebted to Vico, notably the classical philologist Hermann Usener, whose encyclopedic Götternamen () traces the metaphorical origins of ancient religion. He con- trasts Warburg’s understanding of metaphor with Ernst Cassirer’s theory of the symbol and with the account of all language as dead metaphor in Nietzsche’s post- humously published essay ‘Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn’ (though Johnson curiously fails to notice that Nietzsche’s theory is anticipated by Jean Paul in a passage quoted by Warburg and reproduced here on p. ). ere is, however, a close affinity with Hans Blumenberg, for whom metaphors are not the expression of thought but above all a means of thinking and hence share the fluidity of Warburg’s Pathosformeln. Johnson’s final chapter asks why Warburg, in the last year of his life, was so enraptured by reading Giordano Bruno, and concludes that Bruno’s passionate allegories made him for Warburg ‘an archetypal figure who heroically, ethically, and, in the end, tragically dedicates his life to taming astrological superstition and associated monstrous imagery’ (p. ).

It is divided into two halves. e first half sets out a detailed methodological apparatus for analysing the potential emotional effects of narrative fiction. e second half applies this methodology to three German-language novels of the s written by authors from Prague: Kaa’s Das Schloss (), Perutz’s Der Meister des Jüngsten Tages (), and Werfel’s Verdi: Roman der Oper (). In the case of each novel, Claudia Hillebrandt uses the first published reviews in order to test her interpretative hypotheses empirically in terms of the text’s reception by contemporary readers. Hillebrandt proceeds with caution. She deliberately excludes certain categories of emotional response from her investigation. She concedes that the evocation of mood resists classification (p. ); and she also rules out associative emotions which do not lend themselves to narratological analysis because they require exten- sive contextualization (p. ). Hillebrandt therefore restricts herself to an analysis </page> </plain_text>
