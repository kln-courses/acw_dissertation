<plain_text><page sequence="1">NICHOLAS GEORGALIS REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE ABSTRACT. The orthodox view in the study of representation is that a strictly third-person objective methodology must be employed. The acceptance of this methodology is shown to be a fundamental and debilitating error. Toward this end I defend what I call "the particularity requirement," discuss an important distinction between representers and information bearers, and identify what I call "the funda mental fact of representation." I argue that any theory of representation must accommodate these, but that any theory that also is based upon a strictly third person methodology lacks the resources to provide for any of them. It is shown that this failure extends to teleological accounts of representation, despite appearances to the contrary. In the course of this, I argue for the acceptance of a methodological principle, methodological chauvinism, and I show how it implicates a restricted use of the first-person perspective in the study of representation. I explain a nonphenomenal first-person concept, minimal content, which I have introduced and defended more fully elsewhere, the features of which lead to the recognition of a unique intentional state that I call the fundamental intentional state. It is so called since "normal" intentional states presuppose it. Importantly, the logical structure of this state is different from all other intentional states. Lastly, I argue that the expanded meth odology I adopt is neither unscientific nor anthropomorphic, despite its employment of a first-person perspective. Ironically, it is the exclusive use of third-person meth odologies that leads to anthropomorphism in the study of representation. 1. INTRODUCTION A fundamental question that is rightfully receiving a great deal of attention in contemporary philosophy is how to give an account of the content of intentional states. It is impossible to ignore the concept of representation in any thorough attempt to provide an explanation of such content. Here are some of the questions regarding representation that I will examine: How is it that contents of intentional states come to represent things to us? What is required for a physical token - be it some portion of a brain, state of a nervous system, or marks on paper - to represent something else? What is required to determine which nonhuman creatures or devices have representational states? Synthese (2006) 150: 281-325 DOI 10.1007/sl 1229-004-6268-5 ? Springer 2006</page><page sequence="2">282 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS Because representation also plays such a central role in the study of both natural and artificial intelligence, the proper understanding of it is critical not only to philosophers, but to computer scientists, neurophysiologists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists as well. There may well be no univocal concept of either representation or intelligence employed throughout (or within) these diverse inves tigations. Perhaps, this is how it should be, but if this is so, the different concepts must be made explicit to avoid equivocation, with different terms introduced to mark such differences. In any case, it is imperative that we isolate the concept of representation implicated in human cognition and behavior before we attempt to decide which nonhuman systems have similar representational states. We must not utilize an equivocal concept of representation. Nor should we uncritically exploit a concept of representation, instances of which may be found in many species, but which has not yet been demon strated as the operative concept of representation in the human performance of intelligent tasks. Not many agree with this. For example, long ago Daniel Dennett (1978, 91) after listing a wide variety of things that he says represent (words, thoughts, thinkers, pictures, computers, animals, sentences, mechanisms, states, functions, nerve impulses, and formal models), goes on to say: "It will not do to divide and conquer here ... what is important is that there is something that binds them all together, and we need a theory that can unify the variety." Dennett (1987, 5) also explicitly rejects the idea that the first-person perspective is apt for the development of such a theory: He states, "I declare my starting point to be the objective, materialistic, third-person world of the physical sciences", which he correctly characterizes as "the orthodox choice today in the English-speaking philosophical world." It is still the orthodoxy. Such a wide ranging theory as Dennett envisions that is based upon a strictly third-person methodology might be interesting in its own right, but there is a definite risk that it would engender equivocation and obscure what is distinctive about human represen tational states. It is argued that some of the items that Dennett and others would list among the things that represent are more usefully classed as something short of representation, what I will distinguish later as information bearers. I give several arguments as to why the orthodox choice of an exclusively third-person methodology must be aban doned to achieve an adequate understanding of representation. Specifically, I show that an adequate theory of representation must:</page><page sequence="3">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 283 (1) Satisfy the particularity requirement, (2) Distinguish representers from information bearers, and (3) Account for the fundamental fact of representation. The emphasized concepts are explained and defended. I argue that the orthodox methodology lacks the resources to do any of 1-3, while a new theory of representation that I argue for does. So I am at odds with many, if not most, contemporary philosophers and cognitive scientists, both with regard to the theory I advance and the meth odology adopted. I introduce a methodological principle: methodological chauvinism that implements our first-person perspective. Certain features are thereby identified which must either be accounted for in a theory of representation or they must be shown to be mere illusions. Simply ignoring them is not an option. Although others have emphasized the importance of the first-person perspective, I use it to make several new points. Of special note is the introduction of a central and unique concept, minimal content. This, in turn, leads to the uncovering of a unique fact that I call the fundamental intentional state. If I am right about all this, no strictly third-person methodology can be adequate for the study of mind or representation and, importantly, con sciousness is very likely necessary for representation. Lastly, I argue that the methodology I adopt is neither unscientific nor anthropo morphic, despite its employment of the first-person perspective. Ironically, it is shown that the exclusive use of the third-person perspective is more likely to lead to anthropomorphism in the study of representation. 2. METHODOLOGICAL CHAUVINISM AND THE ROLE OF A FIRST-PERSON METHODOLOGY An organism or artificial system may move in such a way that, when viewed from a third-person perspective, it would appear that it must have representational states. Nevertheless, as far as the entity itself is concerned, the idea of representation may be totally idle in giving an account of what has transpired. The subject in question may have so moved simply because of the way some part was causally connected to other parts of the subject. If we assume, as I do, that there are both genuine and merely apparent representational states, we are forced to ask how we may correctly distinguish them. These epistemological</page><page sequence="4">284 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS questions may ultimately have no bearing on the problem as to what is required for an entity to have a representational state; still, until we are able to say in virtue of what feature, or features, we do have representational states, we must respect this epistemological point by exercising restraint in the attribution of representational states to nonhumans. Indeed my suggestion is that the point be raised to the status of a methodological principle. Ideally a demarcation between genuine and apparent representa tional states would be determined through specification of the nec essary and sufficient conditions for each. Unfortunately, it is not even known whether there is a single set of such conditions for represen tational states, much less what they are. Typically, some prominent features of our representational states (e.g., certain causal, informa tional, functional, or computational relation) are selected. Then, when such a feature is found in various nonhuman entities and they exhibit certain relevant behaviors, they are alleged to have repre sentational states on that basis. When different features are posited as characteristic of representation, different extensions of entities having representational states are thus determined and arguments ensue. Such debates typically involve each party accusing the other of beg ging the question. For example, Zenon Pylyshyn (1980, 443), in the context of discussing Searle's famous Chinese Room, offers by way of criticism that: ... [W]e cannot take as sacred anyone's intuitions about such things or whether another creature has intentionality - especially when such intuitions rest (as Searle's do, by his own admission) on knowing what the creature (or machine) is made of...Clearly, intuitions based on nothing but such anthropocentric chauvinism cannot form the foundations of a science of cognition. Perhaps Pylysyn is right; nevertheless, such a charge is double-edged. It is no more legitimate to hold that a nonhuman being has inten tional or representational states because it has X, where the value of X may be a certain computational structure (Pylyshyn's favored feature), or whatever, until it is established that we have intentional or representational states because of X than it is to appeal to intu itions about other nonhumans' states based upon what they are made of. Our merely having X, even when X is a plausible candidate for why we have intentional or representational states, is not sufficient reason to attribute states of the same sort to a nonhuman simply because it has X. Later I will address the issue of where charges of anthropomorphism are properly directed.</page><page sequence="5">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 285 Despite widely differing intuitions as to what is central to a rep resentational state, there are pertinent matters agreed upon by vir tually all parties. It behooves us to exploit these points of agreement in the development of any theory of representation. They are as follows: (1) There is a fundamental and, almost, universal agreement that we have representational states, whatever they consist in. (2) There is a fundamental and universal ignorance as to what exactly it is in virtue of that we do have them. (3) There are wildly divergent views as to what else has them. We may exploit these points of agreement in a principle that I call methodological chauvinism: The foundation for the development of any theory of representation should use a restricted database consisting of elements established from the first-person perspec tive to be representations or representational states. The restriction imposed by this principle is justified because any theory of representation must account for these clear cases. Fur thermore, any instances initially excluded are not, thereby, forever consigned as nonrepresentational. Any genuine cases of representa tional states among them are ones that will eventually be accounted for by a theory of representation developed from the restricted database. It is, if you will, a conservative principle of safety, one least likely to lead us astray, however great our initial ignorance of what constitutes a representation or representational state. The worst that would happen by adopting this principle would be that any genuine cases of representations that are initially excluded by it would be delayed in their inclusion among the representational. In marked contrast, the current prevalent procedures violate methodological chauvinism and, as a result, lead to potential dead ends. To see this, suppose a kind of entity is initially included among those clearly having representational states (humans) because they (certain nonhuman kinds) have some features assumed to be sufficient for our having representational states. Suppose further that the fea tures in question are not sufficient, and entities of that kind do not in fact have representational states of the sort that we do. This erro neous, yet possible, inclusion of such entities in the initial database will, at the very least, produce serious distortions in the developing theory. More probably, such inclusion will result in something other</page><page sequence="6">286 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS than a theory of representation, since it accommodates states of entities that (by hypothesis) are not representational. The prevalent and competing methodology allows, if it does not encourage, just such erroneous or distorting results. (Compare Dennett's remarks quoted above.) One might object that the restricted data set endorsed by methodological chauvinism could just as well lead us astray. One might think that just this kind of distortion would have occurred had the early Newtonians adopted my principle and argued that the data for the laws of motions should be restricted to that of medium sized objects moving at moderate velocities; after all, the early Newtonians might have continued, "any theory of mechanics must explain at least the motions of these central objects". Of course, this procedure would have been confounded on learning that the very small, very large, and very fast do not behave in accordance with the Newtonian laws.1 Well, surely there are no guarantees, still, applying the principle to representation is importantly disanalogous to mechanics and has an independent support for its application to representation. First, a clarification, methodological chauvinism is not advanced as a methodological principle that should apply to all areas of investigation. As formulated above it is restricted to representation, and while it has more general application, to wit, to all those areas of investigation where there is a first-person perspective on the relevant domain, there is no reason to think that it should be relevant where that perspective is absent, e.g., mechanics. So there is this crucial disanalogy between the cases of representation and mechanics vis a vis the methodological principle at issue. What distinguishes repre sentation from most other areas, in particular mechanics, is the fact that we sometimes have a first-person perspective regarding our own representations. (Compare my last section, "Does a First-person Perspective Force the Results to be Subjective?") There is also an important epistemic difference between the case of representation and that of mechanics. As I point out, there are serious and diverse disagreements regarding what other creatures or systems represent, or what enables it. (Cf. the Searle/Pylyshyn contrast, discussed above.) During the 19th century, there were no similar disagreements regarding the dynamics of the very large, very small, or the very fast; there was unanimity in the belief that Newton's laws governed them all. Although they were wrong, Newton's successes and the lack of any reason (at the time) to think</page><page sequence="7">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 287 otherwise made it methodologically sound to proceed in this way. Regarding representation, we have nothing that comes close to being generally accepted theory of it; moreover, we have severe disagreements on what counts as a genuine representation. Indeed, just such radical divergences that speak to the advisability of the advocated principle: Not all these disputants can be right, so the more cautious approach endorsed by methodological chauvinism is fitting. Under such conditions, we should proceed from cases on which there is widespread agreement on their being genuine repre sentations. What, then, accounts for the widespread agreement on the re stricted database authorized by methodological chauvinism? It is certainly not by simply observing others or limiting ourselves to objectively available evidence, as a strictly third-person methodol ogy would counsel. It is the fact that we are sometimes conscious of our representational states; that they are representational is known through our special first-person access to some of these occurrent states. I stress that the asymmetry of access to intentional states from the first- and third-person perspective relied upon herein is of a most limited sort. That we have this access is itself known only through the first-person perspective. Thus, we move quickly from a secure uncontroversial point (we have representational states) to claims involving consciousness, (limited) privileged access, and the importance of the first-person perspective, claims fraught with dif ficulties.2 A further methodological point: If I am right about the indis pensable role of the first-person perspective in the discussion of representation and the invisibility of minimal content (a central concept introduced below) from a third-person perspective, it has the important implication that my interlocutor must at least temporarily adopt the first-person perspective in assessing my claims. For if I am right on these matters my arguments in their support cannot even be comprehended unless this is done. This does not prejudge things in my favor, for if I am wrong, such temporary adoption of the first person perspective should prove innocuous, since it would be ulti mately eliminable. The central concept of my theory of mind is a subjective non qualitative content, that I call minimal content. I explain this key concept here to expedite matters without attempting a full defense (provided elsewhere). The need for the concept of minimal content arises from the fact that the locution "the subject of an agent's</page><page sequence="8">288 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS intentional state" turns out to be systematically ambiguous between an objective and a subjective reading of this phrase.3 Importantly, these two contents, minimal and objective, sometimes signal the same reference, sometimes not. Minimal content is the subject of the intentional state as conceived by the agent. It is a kind of nonquali tative narrow content that is distinct from the usual varieties of narrow content. The recognition of minimal content and its impor tance in the analysis of intentional states requires a first-person per spective - it is invisible from an exclusively third-person perspective of intentional states.4 Both contents are required for an adequate analysis of intentional states. Another important feature of minimal content (which I will explain more fully in a section below) is that an agent constitutes her minimal content. The other side of the ambiguity of the locution "the subject of an agent's intentional state" is its objective content. Objective content is the subject of the state that an objective observer would ascribe as the subject of the agent's thought. Unlike minimal content, objective content is determinable using a strictly third-person methodology. While it is important to keep minimal and objective content distinct, I hold that both are required for an adequate analysis of intentionality and representation (Georgalis (1994), (chapter 1)). The type of severely limited privileged access relied upon herein warrants the claim that, for some of our states, an individual is or can be aware that they are representational. Methodological chauvinism counsels that we base our investigation on such states. Importantly, the first-person perspective on such states makes manifest that they represent not just something else - but they represent something in particular and to the individual in that state. There are those who would doubt that either the first-person perspective or the conscious element implicit in all of this is necessary for being in a representa tional state.5 We shall see that these elements are clearly sufficient to secure the particularity of a representation. In the next section, I give an argument as to why a strictly third-person methodology fails in this task and why we should expect it to fail. This pertains to item 1 in the introduction. Consequently, the capacity for consciousness and the first-person perspective it entails are shown to be crucial to secure the particularity of a representation and, hence, to represent.6 It will be seen that consciousness also plays a central role in attending to items 2 and 3 of the introduction. Collectively these results give strong support to the thesis that consciousness is necessary for representation.</page><page sequence="9">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 289 3. REPRESENTING PARTICULAR THINGS: THE PARTICULARITY REQUIREMENT Consider the fact that when an item represents something else - qua that representation - a particular object or state of affairs is repre sented. It would not be that representation if it did not have that particular object? Clearly, a given physical item r, under the proper conditions, can represent something, say, t; yet, it is equally clear that the same item r, under different conditions, can represent some other item t', distinct from t. Few, if any, would maintain that any physical item - as such - necessarily represents some particular object or that it can represent only that object.8 In speaking of a "physical item as such," I am speaking of a physical item examined from a strictly third person perspective. In short, no such physical item intrinsically rep resents some single particular thing. While this last point is obvious, the power of it against the adequacy of strictly third-person meth odologies has not been appreciated: Since there is no necessary connection between a physical item serving as a representation and that which it represents, if the representation is to do its job, there must not only be some represented item, somehow the uniqueness of what is represented must be secured. Call this the "particularity requirement." If a strictly third-person methodologist were to demonstrate that there are physical structures that, as such, intrinsically rep resent, then much of what I will argue for would be refuted. Given a wide range of factors, e.g., the underdetermination of theories by objective data, pessimism regarding this should reign. Of course, while any intrinsic representation would be unique, I do not presuppose the converse (though I believe it is true). I allow that it is possible that there are representations that un iquely represent that are not intrinsic.9 However, some of the same considerations that count against a "physical item as such" (as above) being an intrinsic representation applies equally against its being unique. Although much work has been devoted to how the content of representational state is determined, the question whether such ac counts uniquely determine, hence, whether they provide for the particularity requirement, is typically ignored. David Armstrong is an exception; long ago he implicitly recognized the need, and he at tempted to address this issue of particularity or uniqueness via the concept of intrinsic power to represent. He states:</page><page sequence="10">290 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS Beliefs are to be thought of as maps which carry their interpretation of reality within themselves. Of their own nature, apart from any conventions of interpretation, they point to the existence of a certain state of affairs (though there may be no such state of affairs). They have an intrinsic power of representation. (1973, 4) He tells us that this "intrinsic power of representation" consists in "... the self-directedness of belief- and thought - states ..." (1973, 54). After distinguishing ideas from concepts and each of these into simple and complex, the burden of self-directedness falls on simple concepts. He attempted to explain this self-directedness by holding that simple concepts have "... certain sorts of selective capacity to wards things that fall under the concept in question."10 So, Armstrong was aware of the need to secure the uniqueness of the representation. The fact is, however, that Armstrong only tells us that these concepts must be self-directed - in order that they may have an "intrinsic power of representation" - without pro viding any support. At best Armstrong's account of how these concepts could be self-directed takes refuge in some sort of ostensi?n. Surely this will not help, as Wittgenstein and Quine have taught us that ostensi?n is inadequate to secure unique ref erence. Furthermore, if this ostensi?n is now to be some capacity of a simple concept or some inner-state, an account of how this capacity could be determined using a strictly third-person meth odology is crucial to a physicalist and to Armstrong in particular, since he introduces it, in large part, to avoid Brentano's explana tion of the directedness of, say, belief states in terms of an irre ducible nonphysical character of intentionality. (cf. 1973, 54, 68) Armstrong fails to address this and, to my knowledge, no one else has either. It is my contention that an exclusively third-person methodology lacks the resources to provide for this self-directedness or intrinsic representation, hence, the particularity requirement. In saying this, my remarks are directed to the typical physicalist who restricts herself to a strictly third-person methodology; I will argue more fully for this below. If I am right in this contention, then I will have a very general and powerful argument against any theory of representation that restricts itself to a strictly third-person methodology. Any explanation of the directedness of intentional states or that they have a unique referent requires inclusion of a first-person methodology.11 The obstacles to satisfying the particularity require ment do not obtain on this expanded methodology. For example, the problems with ostensi?n, mentioned above, result from attempts to</page><page sequence="11">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 291 determine the object of another's ostended object, not one's own. An individual is able to determine one's own ostended object - as she conceives it - from her first-person perspective. From the individual's point of view, at least sometimes, there is no problem knowing what in particular is represented in the sense of minimal content - as this is constituted by that very act of representation on the part of the agent. But it is the agent not, say, the concept itself, that secures the uniqueness of the representation (again, in the sense of its minimal content). Of course, this does not explain just how an individual is able to do this, but it is evident that an individual can and does do this. Matters are completely different from a third-person perspective, since from this vantage point the available evidence is compatible with attributions of various objective contents. To see this consider the fact that while two different theorists using the same formal theory and manipulating the same symbols in the same way, one could have as the minimal content of her thoughts numbers, the other sets. A theorist could be explicitly or implicitly aware that the statements she was proving were, as far as she was concerned, about numbers. Either way, she operates with a particular map ping that determines what objects she conceives her thoughts and statements to be about. Similarly for a different theorist working with the same formal theory, but who conceives (implicitly or explicitly) the mapping to be to sets, not numbers. A physical token of a type, say 3, represents some particular object to the theorist, either a certain number or a certain set, depending on which theorist is operating with that physical token. What their respective minimal contents are could be, and are on occasion, noninferentially known to each of them from their first-person perspective. In contrast, it is utterly opaque from a strictly third person perspective since, from the latter perspective, attribution of either number or set to each of the theorists is equally warranted. Moreover, a third theorist, who knew of the different models for the formal theory, could "switch" from one to the other at will, thereby changing the particular representation for her, her minimal content, but this would be undetectable, i.e., invisible, from a strictly third-person perspective.12 Here is not the place to provide a full argument that anyone employing a strictly third-person methodology can neither accommodate the limited privileged access the agent has to her particular minimal content, nor the securing of the particularity of</page><page sequence="12">292 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS the representation. Some reasons have been offered to be pessi mistic regarding this, but suffice for now to notice simply that it has not been done, though an adequate account of representation requires it. At the same time and in marked contrast, it is clear that when one adopts the theorist's perspective, when one adopts a first-person perspective on the cases just considered, both the awareness of the subject of the thought, in the sense of minimal content, and its particularity is simply and directly evident to the thinker herself. One might deny that it is the agent that determines which object is represented or which mapping is operative, hence, what is rep resented, and suggests instead that it is the physical item's (r's) causal, informational, or functional role, or even, the purpose to which it is put that determines the relevant mapping. One might argue further that this can be established apart from the agent as such, and that such matters as these are completely manageable from the third-person perspective. My (quick) response is that if r has one functional or purposive role, it has many. (This can be shown by expanding the number/set theorist cases discussed above, see Georgalis (1996), (chapterl)). Thus, individuation or specifica tion of the roles or purposes is a process that does not in itself lead to a unique result but, typically, representation is a representation of one, not many different possible represented objects, events, processes, or states of affairs.13 So an appeal to purpose or func tional role, when restricted to a third-person perspective, can neither determine the operative mapping nor what, in particular, is repre sented. I will also address how an appeal to purpose in fact sup ports my contention of the essential role of the first-person perspective in the discussion of Cases 1 and 2, below. In addition to what I have already said, the adequacy of causal role to secure uniqueness can be put aside by an appeal to Dretske's well-known criticism of such theories, viz., they fail to give principled reasons for individuating one of the many causal antecedents to the "rep resentation". Informational accounts will be argued against below; the argument is based upon the distinction between information bearers and representers. The generality of the distinction coupled with the particularity requirement and the limitations on a strictly third-person methodology will also undermine theories of repre sentation such as that of Fred Dretske and Ruth Millikan, discussed below. First, I offer, in the next two sections, more explanation of minimal content and its relation to intentionality.</page><page sequence="13">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 293 4. THE CONSTITUTING OF MINIMAL CONTENT On my theory, it is through a direct act that the agent grasps what the subject of her thought is - in one sense - her minimal content: It is constitutive of that thought that it be of that very object represented by her minimal content. It is this that provides (though, clearly, not by this alone) for the uniqueness of what is represented by her thought. The reader's understanding of what I mean by "the agent con stituting her minimal content" will be facilitated if the number/set theorist, discussed above, is kept in mind; especially the theorist who knew that the formal theory with which she was working had dif ferent models with different domains (numbers or sets) and was able to switch from one to the other at will, with corresponding switches of her minimal contents and, therefore, also of her thoughts. It is important that this kind of case be kept in mind in a particular way: my reader should adopt the perspective of the theorist; imagine yourself to be the theorist. As indicated earlier, if I am right about the necessity of including a first-person perspective, my interlocutor must adopt that perspective, at least temporarily, to understand my argument, and she may do so without prejudging the issue. Could a given item be mapped to a different object than the agent intends? Most assuredly. Could the agent, therefore, be wrong in her determination of what is represented (in the sense of minimal con tent)? No. Not only is error ruled out, it does not even make sense to talk of error here. The agent's particular implementation, explicitly or implicitly, of a mapping is partly constitutive of that particular act of representation. The agent's thought would not be that thought if it did not have that minimal content. I hasten to add that in holding that the agent cannot be wrong as to which mapping or object is in tended,1 / do not mean that she cannot be wrong in how she represents the world. Her minimal content may not match the relevant objective content. What she cannot be mistaken about, at least in simple cases, is which object her minimal content represents, what she conceives to be the subject of her thought. She certainly can be wrong as to whether the employed representation is an accurate representation of the relevant part of the world, that is, she can be wrong about the objective content of her thought. (Recall that on my view both min imal and objective content are required for an adequate analysis of intentionality, and these may or may not match.) So the determination of a minimal content is ultimately based on the actions of some agent. No matter whether the agent explicitly</page><page sequence="14">294 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS considers and selects the mapping or, as is typical, just tacitly oper ates with it. What is essential is that the agent was at one time aware of the mapping, or what particular was represented by some item or symbol she employed, and may be so again, not that she be conscious of this whenever she uses the item. In saying this is achieved by the agent, I am not saying that this is always a private conscious act done in total isolation. Nor need the agent always be a conscious of the mapping whenever she uses the representation; nor is it an act that is generally carried out independently of various conventions operative in the agent's community. The agent may select or operate with mappings in violation of her community's conventions, but typically she will not. When she explicitly does do so without putting her audience on proper notice, she will be undoubtedly and deservedly misunderstood. In such matters, it is more typical that deviations from community norms are based on the agent's ignorance, however. (The exact role conventions play in determining relevant mappings and just how an individual may deviate from those conventions is addressed in more detail in my discussion (Georgalis (1999), (chapter 6)) of Burge's thought experiment (1979); I argue that despite wide spread belief to the contrary, individualism is unscathed by Burge's argument, in part because minimal content was unnoticed in these discussions.) Let me emphasize that I am not offering an account of the act of minimal content constitution. Such an account would require spe cifics of both psychology and neuroscience. Just how we are able to constitute minimal content is largely an empirical question. Never theless, that we do this is evident from the first-person perspective. By reflecting on certain situations, e.g., the "switching" number/set theorist case, and doing so from the theorist's point of view, it is evident that the agent is able to constitute her minimal content. The act of constituting minimal content is no more "spooky" or myste rious than many other empirical phenomena, phenomena that we know occur without yet knowing how they occur. There are cases, then, where what is represented by an item is in part constituted by the agent to whom this item is a representation, and the agent can have noninferential knowledge of this. In such cases, there is a kind of noninferential "grasping" on the part of the thinker as to what she intends to represent and, thus, if only implicitly, of the relevant mapping too. The basis for this grasping and how it is an improvement over Frege's use ofthat expression was discussed in Georgalis, (1994).The difference with Frege that is of</page><page sequence="15">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 295 paramount importance is the fact that what is grasped, minimal contents, are unabashedly subjective on my theory. Minimal contents are constituted by the individual thinker in the logical sense that the agent's thought that has that minimal content would not be that thought unless the subject of the thought were exactly what the agent conceives it to be. That we each constitute our own subjective min imal contents makes the idea of our "grasping" them readily intelli gible. This is in contrast to Frege, who required the grasping of an objective content, his sense. Being objective, the very idea of an agent "grasping" it is seriously problematic. The idea of grasping a sub jectively constituted content is, in contrast, quite straight-forward and unproblematic from a first-person perspective. It is thus that the particularity requirement is satisfied from this perspective. To repeat, it is constitutive of ones entertaining some particular thought that it has the minimal content that it does, that it represents what it does for the agent. (That it is for the agent is crucial and follows from the subjectivity of the concept. This aspect will be ex panded upon below in my discussion of "the fundamental fact of representation".) Therefore, the agent's grasping her minimal content follows directly from her constituting it. It simply would be a different thought or a different representation, if it did not have the subject that she takes it to have. So, not only does minimal content satisfy the particularity requirement, it turns out that it is an intrinsic repre sentation. The first-person aspects of minimal content are necessary for it have both of these features. That representations of the objective content of her thought may diverge from her minimal content in no way obviates these claims for the character of repre sentations of objective contents is different from that of minimal contents.15 Representations of objective contents are completely analyzable within an exclusively third-person methodology, but as such they are neither intrinsic nor do they satisfy the particularity requirement. 5. THE FUNDAMENTAL INTENTIONAL STATE It is the asymmetry between the agent and an observer of her regarding the subjective constitution of the agent's minimal content that explains the securing o? particularity of the representation in the first-person case that is unavailable (in the same way) to the observer: The problem of multiply represented objects is an artifact of the</page><page sequence="16">296 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS reliance on a strictly third-person methodology. (Compare the dif ferences in the number/set theory cases from the first- and third person perspectives, discussed above.) Abandoning this artificial restriction not only eliminates the nonuniqueness problem, a new crucial point emerges: The subjective constitution by an agent of her minimal content makes it a different and unique intentional state that is presupposed by all other intentional states. Here is how it differs. Normal intentional states involve an agent S having a certain psychological attitude *F (believing, desiring, and so forth) toward a representational content R-S(*F(R)). R may represent a thing or a state of affairs. In either case, it is fundamental on my theory that R requires both an objective (o or &lt;E&gt;(o)) and a subjective (m or the O(m)) characterization. Now, the minimal content, m being about something, is itself "directed" but not in the way that repre sentational content as objectively characterized is directed. For on the objective reading of R, it is not constituted by the agent. In contrast, on the subjective reading of R - as m or O(m) - it or a component of it is. So, while one's having a minimal content is itself an intentional state, it is a unique one. Its logical structure differs from that of normal intentional states. The having of minimal content cannot be characterized as a psychological attitude directed at something else, as normal intentional states are. Unlike all other contents, the agent constitutes minimal content. Minimal content does not merely represent; it has the uniquely sin gular property of representing in virtue of the agent constituting the content. The minimal content of the act and the act itself - the con stituting - are not logically separable. So even if one were to attempt to construe the constituting act as a psychological attitude, it would be distinctively different from the usual psychological attitudes, since all of these are logically separable from their contents. Therefore, the aboutness relation involved with minimal content is unique and fundamental.16 This is a wonderful consequence, since if the funda mental intentional state had the same logical structure as that of normal intentional states, there would be a danger of an infinite regress.17 Minimal content is at once different from and presupposed by all normal intentional states. It is the fundamental intentional state. I call it "fundamental" because there can be no normal intentional states without it. I call it "intentional" not because it has the same logical structure as normal intentional states - it does not - but because it has the central feature of such states - "aboutness",</page><page sequence="17">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 297 though as I have stressed, it is about things in way peculiar to it - it, unlike normal intentional states, involves a constituting relation that is logically inseparable from the content it constitutes.18 This difference is what enables the satisfaction of the particularity requirement, and it goes to the very heart of the ambiguity in the locution "what a thought is about", an ambiguity that is accom modated by the introduction of the distinction between minimal and objective content. I repeat: questions regarding what normal inten tional states are about are systematically ambiguous between these two contents. If I am right about minimal content, however, the fundamental intentional state is not similarly ambiguous. It follows that the subjective side of the ambiguity is logically prior to its objective side. 6. METHODOLOGICAL CHAUVINISM AND THE FUNDAMENTAL FACT OF REPRESENTATION If the constitution of minimal content is the fundamental intentional state, the particularity requirement must be satisfied, and third-per son methodologies fail in the latter, as I have argued, then a plausible candidate for a necessary condition on representation emerges: For any item r to represent a particular item t, there must be an agent s to whom r represents t. As explained above, the particularity problem is overcome when the agent s has the capacity to noninferentially grasp her subjectively constituted particular minimal content. Having this capacity is cer tainly sufficient to be a legitimate value of s and, thus, to be in a representational state in a robust sense. The proposed candidate for a necessary condition on representation also brings into prominence the third variable in the representation relation - r represents t to s - the "to whom" is essential. This raises two important questions: "What kinds of entities are legitimate values of s?" and "Must they be conscious to be a legitimate value of s?" These questions are in effect questions as to what besides conscious humans can constitute minimal content. Humans clearly do have this capacity, though just how we do so is far from evident. That we do it is evident from our conscious first person perspective. Here we see the connection between the capacity to have this perspective and the third variable in the representation</page><page sequence="18">298 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS relation: the complete confidence that we are representers derives from our first-person recognition that on some occasions we are legitimate values of the third variable. I can be aware that some vehicle of representation r represents some particular t to me. When this capacity is present it is clearly sufficient to represent a particular object, and there is no reason to doubt that representational states in a robust sense are manifested. Furthermore, given the failure (to date) of a strictly third-person methodology to account for the key factor of uniqueness in representation, unless conditions other than the limited consciousness I have argued for can be shown to be suf ficient, then this capacity is also necessary. Are there other sufficient conditions exclusive of consciousness? Perhaps, but it is clear that where consciousness does not exist, or is not known to exist, controversy prevails as to whether various other features which do obtain are sufficient for the entity to represent, to be a value of the third variable; hence, there is controversy whether representational states are instantiated (compare what was said above of Pylyshyn's criticism of Searle). This is precisely why the principle of methodological chauvinism is advanced. Given the history of discussions of representation, establishing that there are sufficient conditions exclusive of consciousness in a noncontentious way is at best a formidable task. Doing this in a way that also satisfies the particularity requirement appears to be impossible. Importantly, if there is no set of conditions sufficient for representation that does not include consciousness, then consciousness would also be necessary. So anyone who would deny that consciousness and the first-person perspective, in any form, are necessary for representation has a substantial additional burden. Any candidate for a representational state they propose will either be a state of a human or not. If it is a state of a human, they must show consciousness is not necessary to solve the particularity problem. If it is a state of a nonhuman, it is conscious or not. If it is conscious, then they must address the same problem as in our case: they must show that the consciousness ofthat being is not necessary for its representational states. On the other hand, if it is a non-conscious being, they must show that some feature of that being is sufficient for representational states. Before embarking upon this task, however, a prior question must be an swered (given methodological chauvinism), "Does the non-conscious being even have representational states?"; they cannot rely on the claim that it is evident that the state is representational, for the cases are in dispute. But no one has established - with the same degree of</page><page sequence="19">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 299 certainty and certainly not with widespread support - that there are other conditions that are themselves sufficient for representation, sufficient to secure the particularity of the representation, while avoiding an appeal to consciousness. Until this done the claim that the nonconscious being has representational states is unwarranted. Methodological chauvinism counsels the exclusion of any such other conditions until they have been independently established. This would be achieved if starting from our unquestionable representa tional states we were to determine that what makes them represen tational is independent of our consciousness. Then we could safely say of nonhumans who had that feature that they had representa tional states, regardless of whether they were conscious or not. No such other conditions have been successfully advanced, though there have been extensive efforts. Add to this the difficulty (impossibility?) of satisfying the particularity requirement without consciousness, and we have, at the very least, strong inductive ground for holding that consciousness is a necessary condition for having representational states, as well as being sufficient. (I note that in my (2000) and (chapter 3) I argue that there are no unconscious representations). So, what was introduced as a candidate for a necessary condition on representation should be strengthened to include consciousness, For any item r to represent a particular item t, there must be a conscious agent s to whom r represents t. I call this the fundamental fact of representation. The above certainly does not amount to a complete theory of representation. It is not intended to be one. I do wish to emphasize how consciousness via the first-person perspective informs us as to some salient and uncontroversial points that any theory of repre sentation must accommodate. In particular, it highlights the impor tance of the third variable in the representation relation, that variable's relation to the first-person perspective, and a role that consciousness plays in satisfying the particularity requirement. Seeing the importance of the first-person perspective is often obscured by at least two facts. Frequently, perhaps typically, we use an item as representing something else (to ourselves, as well as others) without explicitly thinking that it is a representation, nor considering the operative mapping. Generally, these facts are tacitly understood, for example, when we sketch a map to provide someone with directions. The suppression of the third variable and the lack of any explicit</page><page sequence="20">300 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS appeal to consciousness in such cases is harmless, for there is no uncertainty that they are operative, nor in how to make them explicit. Another more insidious source of obstruction results from a sys tematic ambiguity in the expression "an item r represents t." Suppose that an entity, s, contains an item r which is adapted to some end, and that t is represented by r to some s' other than s, e.g., a human observer of s. In such situations, there can be a quick slide to talk of representational states of s rather than s'. Clearly such situations do not warrant the claim that r (or, for that matter, anything else) represents t to s, even if it does to s'. Thus, potential values of the third variable may be conflated so as to misleadingly suggest that s has representational states, when possibly it is only the human ob server of s, s', that has them. Yet another consequence of the recognition of the importance of the third variable is that expressions such as "r represents t," "r is a representation," or "s is in a representational state" are incomplete in themselves. To even be meaningful, they must be implicit variants of "r represents t to s." (A fuller analysis of representation requires a fourth variable for context or circumstances: r represents t to s in circumstances u, but it is the crucially ignored third variable that is relevant here.) If the values of the missing variables are not obtainable from the context, one has not managed to assert anything at all. 7. INFORMATION BEARERS CONTRASTED WITH GENUINE REPRESENTERS Problems concerning the attributions of representational states just discussed result from ignoring the third variable in the representation relation and the neglect of the first-person perspective. These prob lems are exacerbated by an implicit identification of information bearers with representers. It is a natural consequence of a faulty methodology; one that exclusively employs a third-person perspec tive, for this methodology lacks the resources to make the distinction, and the difference between the two is altogether invisible from that perspective. Failure to take pains to distinguish them has led to serious and deep distortions in the philosophy of mind. To see why, I first state what is meant by information bearer: If a given property P of a system covaries with some other property P' and the co variance is not random, then the system bears information pertaining to P'.19</page><page sequence="21">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 301 Given any information bearing system and our third-person per spective on it, we can always take items in that system to represent other items, simply because we are representers. Under such conditions, we are the values of the third variable; this is certainly not an adequate basis for attributing representational states (in the same sense that we have them) to the information bearer itself. It is possible that the particular information bearer cannot be a value of the third variable, thus, has no representational system and no representational states. Surely, it should be granted that various information bearing organisms are able to behave appropriately as a function of the information they bear. We also frequently bear information without it representing anything to ourselves, as is the case with many (most) of our physiological states, e.g., when the informational content produced by, say, over-drinking results in vomiting. No one doubts that we too are reliable information bearers. Given the kind of creatures we are, however, that information can come to represent something to us. But it is wrong to infer that other kinds of entities have the capacity to represent in this way simply because they are information bearers. It is misleading to speak of them as having representational states, if all we mean is that they are information bearers and certain items in them represent other things to us. On the other hand, even if a system is a repr?senter, is a proper value of the third variable, we cannot maintain that it is simply because it is an information bearer. Nor can we maintain that certain informa tional states of a system are representational states simply because it is known that the system is capable of having genuine representa tional states. That a being has this capacity is not sufficient to say that some particular information bearing state of it is representa tional - to it. I now discuss some examples to clarify the distinction between representing and information bearing and the points just made. The first example shows that some of the problems I have indicated are not just operative when dealing with nonhuman systems. Because these problems also apply to us even though we are clear cases of representers, it is all the more crucial that we ascertain in virtue of what we are able to represent prior to willy-nilly attributing repre sentational states to nonhuman systems or creatures, that is, we must apply the principle of methodological chauvinism. The hot coffee that is now in my stomach most assuredly has caused me to have a certain brain state that bears certain infor mation regarding the contents of my stomach. Suppose a</page><page sequence="22">302 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS neurophysiologist identifies that state and its informational con tent. She can also take my state, or its informational content, to represent to her (she is the value of the third variable): Hot coffee in his (i.e., my) stomach. In such circumstances, the informational content embedded in my brain state becomes representational to the neurophysiologist through her actions. Still, it represents noth ing to me, even though it bears information as to the contents of my stomach. (Similarly, her examination of my informational content will cause her brain state to have some distinct informa tional content but, as such, it represents nothing to her. Of course, her informational content can become an object of attention,20 and thereby represent something else to whoever has attended to it, just as mine has for the neurophysiologist.) No doubt the neurophy siologist is justified in making the general claim that anyone in that particular state, with its particular informational content, probably has hot coffee in his stomach. What she certainly is not justified in saying is that that very informational content represents to the one having it - the one in whom it resides - hot coffee in his own stomach. A similar generalization to the one just given applies to nonhuman cases. A snake's pit organ responds only if there is a warm object moving nearby, and information from that organ is sent to the optic tectum. In the tectum, there is an integration of visual and infrared information. (This is borrowed from the Churchlands (1983, 16)) It is very likely to be true that a snake is in proximity to a moving warm-blooded object, if it is in the indicated state that results from the integration of the visual and infrared information. That the snake has this informational content in no way warrants the claim that it represents to the snake: warm, moving object. Here is why. While there is no doubt that we are genuine representers, one may doubt that snakes are. Since the informational content that resulted from my drinking hot coffee represents nothing to me, there certainly is no reason to think that the indicated snake's informational content, as such, represents anything to it. Importantly, this result obtains even if in fact snakes are proper values of the third variable, even if they are genuine representers and not merely information bearers. We are similar to the snakes in this respect. Both snakes and humans often bear information that represents nothing to either us or to the snakes (which is not to deny that it may play an important causal role in the produc tion of relevant behavior). Yet, there is an important difference</page><page sequence="23">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 303 between what is known and how in the cases of snakes and humans. From our first-person perspective we know that there are (other) items than these that can and do represent other things to us (even our own informational states can become representational to us, if we take appropriate actions). We can never - in the same way - know that this holds for snakes, or other nonhuman sys tems. So any temptation to make the inference that other types of organisms have representational systems on the basis that some item plays an informational role in their survival and it represents something to us must be resisted. (A similar argument would establish the same conclusion with "causal" replacing "informa tional".) We know this because many such items occur in us and, yet, represent nothing to us. As the point is of such importance, I consider sch?mas of two types of cases to elucidate the difference between mere information bearing states and genuinely representational ones manifested in humans. Case 1. Suppose a human subject, S, desires that a certain state of affairs, P, obtain. S, therefore, undertakes various behaviors, B, that S believes will contribute to the realization of P. (For example, having this paper published is, at time of writing, an unrealized goal. I represent that state of affairs to myself and undertake various activities to realize it.) An unrealized end cannot itself be the cause of the agent's behavior, as it is nonexistent in the causal order. Not too many years ago, philosophers worried how some future end could cause some motion now. A solution to this problem is obtained by abandoning the idea that the behavior is caused by an unrealized end and holding that it is the current desire for the end, realized somehow in the agent that plays the relevant causal role. But for such a pro posal to succeed, it is necessary that the agent represents the desired end (the nonexistent state of affairs P), and he must represent it to himself. I fail to see how anything but a conscious being could "represent" a nonexistent state of affairs. We cannot fall back on the concept of information bearing, as it would be most magical that a being could simply bear information regarding a desired nonexistent state of affairs. Certainly no causal relation could exist between the agent's states and a nonexistent state of affairs. Thus, in such situations, what is represented must be manifest to S, if S is to undertake various behaviors in order to help produce P. The conclusion is inescapable: S must be conscious of what is represented.</page><page sequence="24">304 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS Case 2. Consider again a human subject S, but suppose various occurrent stimuli cause S to be in certain states or certain items to occur in S, and that these in turn cause S to undergo various motions M. (I speak of "motions" rather than "behaviors" or "actions" to exclude any suggestion of mentality.) Once again, suppose that it happens that the motions M contribute in a sig nificant way to the production of some state of affairs P. We may even suppose that P contributes to S's survival. If this is the whole of the relevant account (so far as S is concerned) of the production of P, then there is no reason to say that anything was represented to S. Under such circumstances, it also would be wrong to say that S has the particular desire that P be realized. S could not have had that desire because P was a nonexistent state of affairs and, though there were states of S that contributed to the eventual production of P, none of those states represented P, certainly not to S; they simply eventuated in P's actualization. Certainly, S is not conscious of a representation of P. It is important to realize that the significant differences in Cases 1 and 2 can only be recognized from the first-person perspective', they are invisible from the third-person perspective. But the differences here are not only grounds for distinguishing kinds of representational states; they are also grounds for distinguishing kinds of purposive activity, since having a representational state is a necessary condition for engaging in purposive activity. To repeat, one cannot act to bring about a nonexistent state of affairs without having some existent representation of it, and one cannot deliberately act to bring about that nonexistent state of affairs unless both that particular state of affairs is represented (the particularity requirement is satisfied) and it represented to the agent (the agent is a legitimate value of the third variable in the representation relation). So, it would also be wrong to hold that, in situations like Case 2, S undertook the motions M for the purpose of bringing about P, even if it appeared to be so from an objective third-person perspective. For this reason, the teleological component that is often added to various functionalist or naturalist accounts must be viewed with suspicion.21 Given our first-person perspective, we know that sometimes we represent a nonexistent state of affairs to ourselves, and that we undertake certain behaviors for the purpose of actualizing that represented (but nonexistent) state of affairs. To have representational states and engage in purposive activity of the kind evidenced in Case 1, requires the capacity for consciousness.</page><page sequence="25">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 305 8. REPRESENTERS, INFORMATION BEARERS, AND METHODOLOGICAL CHAUVINISM Humans have representational systems and are proper values of the third variable; still, there are clearly occasions when we are not actual values. On those occasions, we fail to be in representational states (of the kind indicated in Case 1) or to engage in the corresponding kind of purposeful activity; nevertheless, a strictly third-person perspective of these activities would suggest that there are representational states involved and the motions are purposive even when neither is the case. Let no one think that the privacy of mental states is the issue here. Although there are certain epistemological problems pertaining to whether other humans, on a specific occasion, are proper values of the third variable, nothing I argue here gives any reason to doubt either that other humans have representational states, or that they have as much (or as little) access to their own representational states as I have to my own. Nor do the questions I raise (such as whether certain motions of other types of entities are truly representational or purposeful) stem from some general skeptical position.22 The point is simply that the difference between information bearing and repre senting is invisible from a strictly third-person perspective. That we are unable to distinguish information bearing and rep resenting from a strictly third-person perspective even when we know the subject is capable of representing, as is sometimes the case in humans, further exacerbates the difficulty of ascertaining when we may correctly attribute such states to nonhuman entities. For if we sometimes have difficulty discerning from a third-person perspective when representational states are operative in the activities of a human, whom we unquestionably know is capable of having repre sentational states, then how can we possibly hope to discern repre sentational states in nonhuman creatures or systems by relying on a strictly third-person perspective when we never have the privilege of the first-person perspective regarding the types of states those crea tures or systems have and do not yet know in virtue of what we have representational states? The grounds for maintaining that nonhu mans are ever proper values for the third variable in the representa tion relation are of necessity quite different from, and far more controversial than, the grounds for maintaining that we sometimes are. To know when to attribute such states to nonhuman creatures, we must first ascertain which of our objective features enable us to represent. If we were to identify such features, being objective, we</page><page sequence="26">306 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS could proceed to ascertain which nonhuman creatures have them and, therefore, are also representers and not merely information bearers. These are compelling reasons to adopt methodological chauvinism. Given the above, we see once again that it is reasonable to with hold the status of representers from nonhuman information bearing systems, at least until we dispel our ignorance as to what it is in virtue of that we do represent. Nonhuman candidates, such as snakes, may stand to all of their states the way we do to some of ours, viz., the ones that represent nothing to us, notwithstanding the fact that those states are information bearing and even may contribute to the crea ture's survival. Were that to be the case, they would not be genuine representers. I stress that I do not maintain that only humans have representational states, but we do not now know what objective feature enables this and until this is known, we have no way of knowing what other creatures or systems represent. It should be clear from earlier sections that consciousness is sufficient to satisfy the particularity requirement. It is our first-person perspective on some of our states that makes it unproblematic both that we are conscious and that we are capable of representing par ticular things. However, this perspective does not reveal in virtue of what we are conscious and represent, only that we are and do . Earlier I offered some reason to think that consciousness is not only sufficient but also necessary for robust representation. Should I turn out to be right about this, however, it would not by itself advance our under standing of which nonhuman beings represent, since we no more know what specific objective features enables consciousness than we do which enable representation. Our knowledge that we are conscious and represent derives from our first-person perspective on some of our own states, we obviously lack that way of knowing any other creature or system is conscious; moreover, the first-person perspective we enjoy regarding some of our own states does not itself reveal what objective feature enables it, hence, we are at a loss as to what to look for in other creatures or systems to determine whether they are conscious or represent. Until we know in virtue of what objective feature we are conscious or represent, we have no grounds for holding that various nonhuman creatures or systems are anything more than information bearing.23 This is a main point of methodo logical chauvinism. The third-person perspective in the study of representational states is of a piece with the attempt to obtain a theory for all manner of</page><page sequence="27">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 307 "representations" (as is manifested by Dennett's remarks quoted earlier). In response to my objections to this, such an advocate may protest that representation occurs in information bearing states; it just is of a "simpler kind" than goes on in those cases that also involve a conscious element. They might hold that paramecia and such do represent, it is just that their representations differ from ours in a number of ways.24 This response is inadequate for, among other reasons, it encourages equivocation on the term 'representation'. The fact is that all of nature's creatures are information bearers because we all are causally related to our environments. Certainly even simple artifacts, such as thermostats or thermometers, which respond in a regular way to certain changes in their environments, are information bearers. Consider the simple case of a thermometer. While it is relatively easy to individuate the informational content in such systems, there is absolutely no temptation to hold that the states of such systems represent anything to the system itself. Of course, states of such systems may easily represent aspects of its environment to us, e.g., the length of a column of alcohol in a glass tube represents a certain temperature of the ambient air to us; but it is sheer nonsense to say that that length represents anything to the thermometer . We are, but it is not, a possible value of the third variable. (Compare my discussion above, as to the danger of conflating potential values for the third variable.) There certainly appears to be significant differ ences in how a thermometer "represents" and how we do it.25 No one questions whether humans, nonhuman animals, and even artifacts, such as thermometers, have in some common sense "rep resentational states", say, that of informational states. But focusing on this common sense not only promotes obscurity, it misses an important point. The crucial question is, given the vast range of di verse information bearers, which among them are proper values of the third variable in the representation relation. For even if I am wrong in thinking that strictly informational states are not repre sentational, there are tantalizing and difficult issues raised by the robust sense of representation that I advocate. For example, is it the "common" or the robust sense of representation that is operative in our performance of intelligent tasks (compare Case 1, above), what enables the robust sense, and which, if any, nonhuman entities are capable of possessing these more robust representational states. Studying the "common sense of representation" across beings does not touch these questions; indeed, it obscures them. Without addressing them we risk conflating representers and information</page><page sequence="28">308 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS bearers. If the difference is real, as I have argued it is, failing to distinguish them can only result in an impoverished, if not false, theory of mind, cognition, and representation. Third-person views of representation violate methodological chauvinism; they thereby encourage the mistaken inference that a given entity has representational states because it bears information. These mistakes are abetted by the fact that third-person views ignore or inadequately treat the third variable in the representation relation. The failure to distinguish representation from information bearing is unacceptable.26 To avoid confusion it is better to withhold the application of the term "repr?senter" (and its variants) from entities not yet known to be legitimate values of the third variable in the representation relation, allowing the application of the term "infor mation bearer" to the rest. If it were to be shown, contrary to my arguments, that the ability to be the value of the third variable does not, after all, involve anything distinctively different and important (viz., the capacity to have the first-person perspective) relative to the concept of representation from what is involved in the cases of information bearers, then this discrimination would be unnecessary. In the meantime, at the very least, it must be acknowledged that there is at least an appearance that a system's capacity to be a possible value of the third variable and to be aware of its contents goes beyond its being simply an information bearer. This difference may be mere appearance, but until that is demonstrated it is an appear ance that cannot be ignored. Should it turn out to be no more than a mere appearance, it is still an appearance that must be accounted 9. CLARIFICATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE ARGUMENTS My focus on the distinction between information and representation may misleadingly suggest to the reader a more restricted target of my arguments than their force merits. One might think that my targets are simply informational theories of representation and so "teleo logical theories" would fall outside the range of my arguments. This would be a mistake: the arguments as they stand apply to any theory of representation that is restricted to a strictly third-person meth odology. This possible misunderstanding of the extent of applicability of my arguments is abetted by the fact that philosophers such as Fred</page><page sequence="29">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 309 Dretske and Ruth Millikan purport to distinguish informational from representational states. They even seem to share some of the concerns that I have been at pains to emphasize. For example, Dretske holds that a representation should have meaning in a sys tem's cognitive economy and not merely be assigned meaning, say, by us. (See note 25) And Millikan holds that to be a representation an item "must be one that functions as a sign or representation for the system itself. (1989, 284) In this section, I discuss these apparent similarities and show that they are only apparent. I also explain why their theories do not escape the arguments already presented. Ulti mately, they fail in satisfying the particularity requirement and the fundamental fact of representation, the "to whom" requirement because, despite their claims to the contrary, they fail to adequately distinguish representers from information bearers. In Millikan's challenge to causal/informational accounts of rep resentation or mental content, she argues that such accounts are unable to settle certain indeterminacies of informational states. (Of course, I agree with her on this.) She thinks that she overcomes this by stressing that it is how the system itself uses the representation: representation consumption rather than production is the key. (Causal/ informational theories emphasize the latter at the expense of the former.) By emphasizing the consumption side, she also thinks that she accommodates the idea that an item is a representation "for the system itself." These claims seem to recognize a distinction between information bearing states and representation, to be in accord with my emphasis on the third variable in the representation relation (the "to whom"), and even ultimately to satisfy the particularity requirement. All this is mere appearance. Millikan discusses Dretske's famous case: There is a species of bacteria that possesses tiny magnets (magnetosomes) whose polarity is aligned in a way conducive to their survival, for given the hemi sphere where the bacteria are located, the magnets' pull the bacteria away from oxygen-rich water.28 There is, however, an obvious informational indeterminacy in the bacteria's (magnetsomes') states, since they reliably covary both with the direction of magnetic north and the direction of less oxygen-rich water. So the question arises, which is represented? Here we have a version of the problem of the particularity of the representation. Millikan's biosemantics attempts to eliminate this indeterminacy: "What the magnetosome represents is only what its consumers require that it corresponds to in order to perform their tasks", (op. cit. p. 290)</page><page sequence="30">310 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS What the bacteria require for their survival is that the representation represents the direction of less oxygen-rich water, not that of the magnetic field. That is how the consumers, the bacteria, use the representation, and that is what is important on the biosemantic view, for it is this that it was selected for by the bacteria's evolu tionary history. So, on her view, the magnetosomes' states uniquely represent the direction of less oxygen-rich water. This she rightly says does not make sense on the informational/causal view of represen tation. Granted that this is an advance on informational/causal views of representation, but it is not sufficient to escape the arguments I have already presented. First, notice that Millikan's discussion presup poses that the bacteria are representers. The thrust of the consider ations that I have already brought to bear on such cases is to bring such uncritical acceptance of "representations" into doubt. The presupposition that her criterion is sufficient for representation vio lates methodological chauvinism. While I have argued that failure to abide by this methodological principle is mistaken, philosophers such as Millikan would clearly reject it. So, I cannot use the principle against her view without appearing to beg at least some questions; I do not so use it, but the conflict is worth pointing out. The class of informational states may be partitioned in many ways. But simply partitioning the class does not by itself show that one of the resulting classes rightly includes the representational. Of course, Millikan has not offered an arbitrary demarcation; indeed, being selected for via an evolutionary history is not an initially implausible candidate to mark a genuine representation. Moreover, this is a powerful distinguishing feature in that once this subclass is identified, not only does the feature appear to distinguish representers from information bearers, both the particularity requirement and the fundamental fact of representation, which we may think of as the "to whom" requirement, appear to be satisfied. Still, I think her partition fails to rise above the level of informational to the representational. Here is why. It is indisputable that we can talk about the pull of the mag netosome representing the direction of less oxygen-rich water, as opposed to magnetic north. We do this because we can also identify the function of moving the bacteria away from oxygen-rich water as conducive to its survival. Thus viewing the "representation" high lights an important aspect relative to this species of bacteria's sur vival. All of this, however, is just a case of our being the value of the</page><page sequence="31">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 311 third variable in the representation relation. Such facts, however, have no bearing on the question whether the state of the magneto some represents to the bacterium, or whether it is a repr?senter. (Compare the earlier discussion of the snake case and its relation to us.) That such states represent this to us in no way supports the claim that anything at all is represented to the bacterium. And the latter is so, notwithstanding the facts that bacteria causally respond to those states in a way conducive to their survival and that this feature was selected for by its evolutionary history. In addition to what was just said against Millikan's view, there is a simple alternative explanation of the bacteria's behavior that makes it clear why no grounds have been offered to say that the bacteria (or the magnetosomes) are anything more than information bearers, despite the fact that their informational states fall into that proper subclass of informational states that Millikan distinguishes as "rep resentational." The explanation I offer is, I submit, more plausible than Millikan's alternative. If I am right in this, no reason has yet been offered to think that the bacteria are representers, and certainly none to think that anything is represented to the bacteria themselves. This discussion will also reveal why Millikan's understanding of: "It must be one that functions as a sign or representation for the system itself \ (1989, 284) is importantly different than mine, despite superficial similarities. To my lights, given the structure of the bacteria, their inhering magnetosomes, and the environment in which they live, they are "wired" in ways that produce beneficial responses to stimuli from the environment. If the favorable feature of the environment (less oxy gen-rich water) is not what is connected in a law-like way to the "proffered representation" (the state of the magnetosome), but something only contingently connected with it, as in the bacteria case, then, so much the luckier are the creatures in question. Such is the power of evolution that traits only contingently connected to some environmental feature may be selected for. However, this is no grounds for holding that "the pull-in-a-direction-at-a-time represents the less oxygen-rich water" (1989 290) to the bacteria, and certainly not to the magnetosome. The bacteria move in that direction simply because of the polarity of their magnets and the magnetic field in which they find themselves. That things are so arranged is precisely why they are still with us, rather than their having died off (as would be the case if the poles had been reversed). It does not follow that the states of the magnetosomes represent anything to the bacteria. Again,</page><page sequence="32">312 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS having such "content" does contribute to their survival, given their nature and the environments in which they occur; the contribution, however, is purely causal. As such, the contribution would still be made whether or not the state of the magnetosomes represents any thing to the bacteria, and it would still be made even if no "repre sentational" but only causal or informational content were involved. I have just criticized Millikan's attempt to eliminate the indeter minacy in the information indicated above. In effect, she tries to satisfy the particularity requirement by emphasizing the consumption side of representation rather than its production, and in the process seems also to solve the "to whom" problem that I have raised in connection with the fundamental fact of representation. But her solution fails to satisfy the logically prior question as to whether a representation is even in play. Without having done this there is no reason to think that she has satisfied the particularity requirement. She has relied upon the fact that the latter, as well as the other requirements mentioned, are satisfied for us. Clearly the latter is not sufficient to establish the satisfaction of these requirements for the bacteria. Adding that the content that we recognize contributes to the creature's survival is of no help unless one could show that the creature also had this conception or shared our value of survival. (More on the issue of value and whose below, when I discuss an argument of Searle's) Therefore, she has not shown that the specified proper subclass of informational states are appropriately viewed as representations, even though they are distinguished from other informational contents by being selected for in the creature's evolu tion. Moreover, while her insistence that an item function as a rep resentation for the system itself, the consumer, appears to involve the third variable in the representation relation as I have identified it, it should now be clear that the similarity is only apparent. The difference between Millikan and me may be brought into sharper focus by considering the concept of function. Crucial to her making her case is the question: Is the function of the state of the magnetosome - as opposed to its causal role - an objective feature? For Millikan's account to work it must be. Millikan has done much serious work on the concept of function, proper and derived. I cannot examine those discussions in detail here. What I will do is give an argument as to why functions are not objective. If they are not, then the appeal to them cannot help to circumvent my arguments against strictly third-person views of representation. The argument is borrowed from Searle - I fully endorse it.</page><page sequence="33">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 3 1 3 Searle reminds us that: "One of Darwin's greatest achievements was to drive teleology out of an account of the origin of species." (1995, 16) My account above as to how the bacteria manage to flourish without anything being represented to them is in accord with this. It is not that the bacteria evolved so that the states of the magnetosomes are to represent this (less oxygen-rich water) rather than that (direction of the environmental magnetic field). It is not for the one purpose or function rather than the other. It simply happened that bacteria with magnetosomes that are aligned in a certain way in certain environments flourished and reproduced and so were selected for. Those in similar environments without this, or some other mechanism that propelled them to less oxygen-rich water, simply died off and did not reproduce their kind. This can be understood in accordance with Darwin's theory, quite apart from teleology or objective functions, and certainly quite apart from the idea that anything is represented to the bacteria, as I have argued. More generally, Searle argues: Either "function" is defined in terms of causes, in which case there is nothing intrinsically functional about functions, they are just causes like any others. Or functions are defined in terms of the furtherance of a set of values that we hold - life, survival, reproduction, health - in which case they are observer relative. (1995, 16, emphasis added) This strikes me as exactly right. Millikan's talk of what the "con sumers require ... to perform their tasks" (1989, 290, italics in the original) is a projection of our values to the bacteria, as though their "task" was to flourish. It is futile to hold that the bacteria have any these values, and it is quite peculiar (at best metaphorical, at worst anthropomorphic) to even think of their having "tasks". We take the state of the magnetosome to represent the direction of less oxygen rich water, given our knowledge of the environment, its biological history, and our values of survival, reproduction, etc. Whatever "functions" are involved in this characterization, they are not objective. If functions are not objective, then the fact that the "function" of the magnetosome was selected for because of its contribution to the bacteria's survival gives us no reason to think that the magnetosome represents the direction of less oxygen-rich water to the bacteria. That it facilitates our understanding of the bacteria's evolutionary history is reason to hold that - from our perspective - it so represents, but it is no reason to hold the bacteria represent and, then, certainly not</page><page sequence="34">314 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS that it represents this in particular to it. Thinking otherwise is to exemplify what I warned against earlier: the conflation of values of the third variable in the representation relation between us and the creature or system we are investigating. (Compare p. 300 above) In fact, the structure and behavior of these bacteria nicely exemplify the abstract schema of Case 2, discussed in an earlier section, where something's behavior appears to involve representations from a strictly third-person perspective, when in fact no representations are involved in the creature's behavior. It should be clear that I have not merely argued that the bacteria's "representations" do not rise to the level of complexity of our rep resentations. I have argued that we have no reason, as yet, to think they represent at all. This negative conclusion is reinforced by the explanation given above of their behavior that is in accord with evolution but that does not involve representations. So, when Milli kan lists at least six fundamental ways which simple organisms' representations differ from ours (1989, 294-297), this is not to my point. Of course, it is obvious and to be expected that simple crea tures and devices - //they represent at all - will have representations which differ from ours in a number of significant ways. The identi fication of such features of our representations is useful. The important point, however, is that saying that these are ways our representations differ from those of simpler creatures presupposes an affirmative answer to the logically prior question as to whether they represent at all. If one holds that no reason has yet been given to say that they do, as I have argued here and throughout this paper, then it is not reassuring to be told that their "representations" are simpler than ours. I have argued that Millikan's successfully distinguishing a proper subclass of informational states is not sufficient to establish that that subclass is representational. So, despite appearances to the contrary, she has not succeeded in distinguishing representation from infor mation. In consequence, she has also failed adequately treat of the "to whom" problem associated with the fundamental fact of repre sentation and to satisfy the particularity requirement. Moreover, the recognition that our representations are more complex than simpler creatures' - assuming that they have them - is no corrective to these shortcomings. Dretske's view similarly appeals to the idea of function to explain representation and distinguish it from information. As with Millikan, Dretske has said much that is important regarding representation and</page><page sequence="35">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 315 information. My discussion of Millikan should make clear how I would deploy my arguments against Dretske's view, so I give only a bare bones sketch of his view which highlights the role objective functions play in it and the outstanding problem associated with them regarding the dialectic of our competing views. He says: The fundamental idea is that a system, S, represents a property, F, if and only if S has the function of indicating (providing information about) the F of a certain domain of objects. (1995, 2) He divides representations between conventional and natural. Both are distinct from information in that an informational state may have multiple informational contents whereas a representation indicates a single property, depending on its indicator function. Its indicator function is determined by what the system was designed to do. Some indicator functions have their informational functions are derived from the intentions of its designers; these are the conventional representations. Thus, a pressure gauge, e.g., is designed to indicate pressure, though the same informational state carries information about temperature; still, since it was designed for the former and not the latter, it represents only pressure. In contrast, natural represen tations do not acquire their indicator functions from the intentions of a designer; they are, Dretske claims, naturally acquired. Clearly, if there are such functions then there are natural representations and we would have a genuine distinction between information and repre sentation, contrary to what I have argued, for if there were such functions, they would be objective features of a state or system. Moreover, the particularity and the "to whom" requirements would appear to be readily satisfied. My thesis that no theory of represen tation that relies upon a strictly third-person methodology can suc ceed would be refuted, if there are objective indicator functions. Are there such functions? Dretske thinks that there are. Does he argue for this? No. In his characteristically straight-forward style, he states: I assume that there are naturally acquired functions and, thus, natural representa tions. I do not argue for this; I assume it. (1995, 7) While he recognizes that there are those few who deny the assump tion (he cites Dennett and Searle), he lists a host of others who endorse it. He also quotes Phillip Kitcher's interpretation of Darwin in support of the assumption: "one of Darwin's important discoveries is that we can think of design without a designer". (1993, 380) The</page><page sequence="36">316 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS suggestion is that Darwin somehow showed us we can have designs, hence, indicator functions, that are not dependent on the intentions of a designer. That the belief that there are naturally acquired, objective, func tions is widely held is not in dispute. Whether it is true is. Does the quote from Kitcher support the assumption? No. In accordance with Searle's take on this and the discussion above, we can allow that, yes, we can think of "design without a designer", but it does not follow from our so conceptualizing it that there is any such objective design; nor, importantly, does Darwinian theory require it. As Searle points out, quoted above, Darwin has shown that we can understand the origin of species without teleology - neither natural nor otherwise. Hence, while believers in naturally acquired objective functions may find comfort in Kitcher's take on "Darwinian design", it offers no support for the assumption. Attempts such as those of Dretske and Millikan to secure the dis tinction between representation and information rest upon an acknowledged unsupported assumption that there are objective functions. Just as I cannot simply appeal to methodological chau vinism to refute their views, mine cannot be refuted by an appeal to this disputed assumption, no matter how widely held. Doing so on either part would simply beg the question. Were it the case that an appeal to such functions was necessary to explain the evolutionary development of biological systems, that would be a point in their favor, but my discussion of the magnetosome, which is in accordance with Darwinian theory, presents an alternative schema that is ade quate for explanation of evolutionary development and which requires no appeal to function, objective or otherwise. This, of course, is not to deny that talk of such functions may provide heuristic assistance to us in explaining such developments. It is a mistake, however, or at the very least unnecessary, to project such functions onto nature's machinations, as I believe Searle's argument above shows. Until advocates of teleological views provide counters to my ear lier arguments or give independent support for the existence of objective functions in nature they have failed to distinguish repre senters from information bearers, notwithstanding some successful efforts in the demarcation of a useful proper subclass of information bearing states. My arguments for the distinction between information bearers and representers are completely general. They are applicable against any theory of representation that rests upon a strictly third person methodology.</page><page sequence="37">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 317 10. DOES A FIRST-PERSON METHODOLOGY FORCE THE RESULTS TO BE SUBJECTIVE? Scientific theories generally have no use for the first-person perspec tive. My theory, and in particular, methodological chauvinism does. Is my view unscientific? No. A theory that is concerned with inten tionality, representation, or phenomenal states, in short, a theory of mind, must include a first-person component, and does so without diminishing its objective or scientific status. I have argued elsewhere (Georgalis (1996), (chapter 3)) that we can have an objective theory of subjectivity, but I now want to identify another important reason why this is so. Specifically, I wish to explain what distinguishes it from a first-person study of other domains of nature. With respect to our own intentional, representational, or phenomenal states, we sometimes have the privilege of the first-person perspective. Impor tantly, this is a perspective we never have with regard to, say, light, matter, or a human cell. This difference in accessibility to the subject matter is precisely why first-person folk theories of the latter types are inadequate and do result in unwarranted anthropomorphism. Given this difference, however, we should expect that a folk theory should succeed in domains where we have some privileged access, while at the same time uniformly failing in those where we have none.29 Dennett (1987, 9), among many others, does not agree. He quotes, with approval, an attack on folk psychology by P. S. Churchland: "So long as the brain functions normally, the inadequacies of the commonsense framework can be hidden from view, but with a damaged brain the inadequacies of theory are unmasked" (1986, 223). The suggestion is that the inadequacies clearly present in the treatment of the abnormal are also present, though "masked," in the normal domain. There is, however, a significantly different reading of these inadequacies of folk psychology, one consistent with my posi tion. Our first-person perspective (for most of us, and by definition) does not extend into the realm of (seriously) abnormal behavior. So, we should not expect success of folk psychology, more specifically, our first-person perspective to be informative regarding abnormal mental states anymore than we expect it to be useful in, say, physics. None of us have a first-person perspective regarding the domain of physics, and most of us lack this perspective regarding seriously abnormal mental behavior. Acknowledging this, however, in no way implies that the inadequacies of the first-person perspective in the study of abnormal human behavior would also be manifest in the</page><page sequence="38">318 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS study of normal behavior, a domain where we clearly have the privilege provided by the first-person perspective. My limitation on the domain of applicability and usefulness of the first-person perspective may appear (on a careless view) to be subject to a criticism advanced by P.S. and P.M. Churchland in "Theory, Taxonomy, and Methodology" (1998, 17-25). There he criticizes (in his colorful way) any defense of a theory that relies on restricting the domain. He maintains that "any hangdog theory ..., so long as it has some paltry success for some benighted purpose within some shel tered domain" (1998, 23) could be defended in this way. But I am not "sheltering" my claims of the value of the first-person perspective from refuting cases, I am simply limiting it to those cases where in fact we have a first-person perspective. To apply it elsewhere would be sheer folly. To dismiss the results it delivers in the domains that it applies because of its lack of value in areas that it does not apply would be nothing short of absurd. One does not denigrate hammers because they are, oh, so inadequate to drive screws. Restricting the domain of applicability of a theory or a method to avoid refutation or criticism is unacceptable only if the character of the theory or methodology is such that, if correct, it ought to apply to a wider domain. But there is nothing in the nature of the first-person method ology that I have advocated and applied that would suggest that it should be applicable to the study of, say, physics, or even abnormal psychology. Though I have argued that it is essential to employ this methodology in the study of mind, there is no suggestion that it should or could be applied to everything we wish to investigate regarding the mind. In particular, nothing that I have said would suggest that it should or could be appli cable to abnormal minds.30 Accepting this is neither a failure of the method, nor a "sheltering" of it from troublesome cases. Still, another deeper worry might dog the reader, for it may appear that I am advocating that we have two theories: one for normal behavior and another for abnormal behavior. This would be problematic, but I am not advocating that, nor does what I have said imply it. There seems little reason to deny -1 do not deny it - that the laws governing normal human behavior are the same laws that govern abnormal behavior, just as the laws governing a properly functioning motor are the same laws that govern a broken one. Allowing this, however, in no way discounts the fact that the first-person perspective reveals certain phenomena that are invisible to a strictly third-person methodology. What is thus re vealed must be accounted for or, at the very least, explained away as some kind of illusion. These phenomena cannot be simply ignored. If</page><page sequence="39">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 319 the phenomena in question are genuine but invisible to some third person methodology, as I have tried to show, then that methodology must be supplemented with a first-person one. This is neither sheltering nor advocacy of dual theories; it is properly using a tool where it ap plies. Therefore, relying on a first-person methodology where we do have the privilege of first-person access is legitimate; ignoring it is not. I have argued that its exclusion will prohibit an adequate understanding of the human mind, not only when the subject is qualia or phenomenal consciousness, but just as importantly when nonphenomenal intentional or representational states are at issue. 11. CLOSING REMARKS My reluctance to attribute representational states to nonhumans is based on several facts. First, if anything is a repr?senter, we are. Secondly, we do not yet know in virtue of what we have this ability. Thirdly, we know that there are systems so structured that when their motions are observed from a strictly third-person perspective they appear to have representational systems, but this appearance is con trary to fact. Fourthly, we never have access to other types of systems' states as we sometimes do to our own. Fifthly, it is that access which both alerts us to the existence of representational states and informs us that we have the capacity to be a value of the third variable in the representation relation. Sixthly, and most importantly, it is in virtue of that subjective access that we are able to successfully represent a particular object, distinguish representers from information bearers, and accommodate the fundamental fact of representation. Recognizing all of this provides substantial grounds for the thesis that consciousness is necessary for representation, a thesis that is reflected in the concept of the fundamental intentional state. Given the inadequacies of strictly third-person methodologies demonstrated above, we must follow the counsel of methodological chauvinism and recognize the role a first-person methodology plays in the study of mind. The ironic result is that by so doing, it purges anthropomor phism from the study of representation.31 NOTES One anonymous referee did raise this objection. 2 I cannot adequately address these difficulties here, though I have tried to overcome them in previous articles. Subsequent references to the forthcoming book will simply</page><page sequence="40">320 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS cite the relevant chapter. (Georgalis 1994, 1996, 1999) and book manuscript forth coming MIT Press. 3 There is a reading of the expression 'subject' in the locution 'subject of the intentional state' that is legitimate but is not my intended usage, viz., as the indi vidual who has the intentional state. My usage concerns a restricted part of the intentional content of the intentional state. For example, if I believe that Mary is beautiful, Mary is the "subject" of my intentional state, not me, not the thinker. Scare quotes are used here because it is this usage of the word 'subject' that I argue is systematically ambiguous and explained below. 4 The reader should be alerted that on my theory minimal content does not have ontological significance - it is merely a moniker for the subject of an agent's thought as she conceives it. The concept, however, is required for an adequate analysis of intentionality. Ibid. 5 The reader is warned that insisting on the conscious aspect of representations does not commit me to holding that when s is occurrently aware that r represents t, her awareness consists in her noticing some peculiar feature of either r or her occurrent state. And that's a good thing, since if it did, that would seriously count against my view. See e.g., Saul Kripke (1982), especially the latter portion of part 2, for a discussion of why it is a mistake to look for such a feature. I am not sympathetic to views that associate a phenomenal aspect with intentional states for reasons pre sented in Georgalis (1996) (chapter 3). Kripke's arguments here give further support for this rejection. In contrast, Tyler B?rge (1997) claims the connection is one of implications: "... access consciousness - indeed, any sort of consciousness - in an individual presupposes the existence of phenomenal consciousness in that individ ual." (emphasis added, p. 426.) For other examples of those who hold there is a phenomenal aspect to intentional states, see Chalmers (1996), Horgan and Tienson (2002), Pitt (forthcoming), Siewert (1998), and Strawson (1994). My article (Georgalis 2003) argues against this claim. 6 The consciousness that I speak of here may be very loosely thought of along the lines of David M. Rosenthal's (1997) concept o? creature consciousness, but one must not put too much stock in thinking of it in this way. As will become clear, my view is that one cannot separate the question of a creature's being conscious from its having intentional or robust representational states. Rosenthal denies this, and his distinc tion between creature and state consciousness is part of the basis for his denial. 7 Searle notes ( 1979) that authors such as Wittgenstein and Kenny have argued that an intentional state and its object have some "internal relation" to one another. Searle agrees and holds that an intentional state is internally related to its object. He states: Because an intentional state contains a representation we can now give a clear sense to the notion that it is 'internally related' to the object it represents: Any represen tation is internally related to its object in the sense that it could not be that repre sentation if it did not have that object, (p. 184) He realizes that much depends on how this relation is explicated. My explication, given below, is in accord with this and is in terms of the concept of minimal content. 8 There is a possible misunderstanding of what I intend to convey with the locution 'particular object', which would lead one to (mistakenly) think that brain states - as such - could satisfy the particularity condition, as follows:</page><page sequence="41">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 321 ... particular neurons have particular receptive fields, not only spatially but in terms of specific features of visual stimuli. These neurons fire action potentials at their maximum frequency only when visual stimuli with particular features (e.g., a par ticular line orientation [in primary visual cortex], motion in a particular direction at a particular speed [in middle temporal cortex], even faces in specific profile [in inferotemporal cortex]). Is that not "particularity" enough? (anonymous referee) Clearly, there is plenty particularity of this sort regarding neuronal states in vision, as there is for other brain subsystems. These particular features are very different, however, from the particular objects perceived by the perceiver. It is the latter with which I am concerned, as it is these that the first-person perspective informs one of, not the former. Moreover, the typical case of representation does not involve the repre sentation of neuronal states, particular or otherwise, at least not to the repr?senter. 9 If, e.g., a causal account of representation could succeed in satisfying the partic ularity requirement, contrary to what I believe, such representations would be unique without being intrinsic. 10 (1973, 6) He adds that not all concepts are selective capacities, and some non simple concepts are selective capacities, but all simple concepts must have selective capacities. 11 On my view, one can be a physicalist and still accommodate the first-person perspective. In the last section here, I indicate how the result may nevertheless be, in a worthwhile sense, objective. See also the article Georgalis (1996) (chapter 3). 12 I argued for this in detail in the article Georgalis (1996) (chapter 3). This extended argument includes showing that not even taking into account the theorist's verbal behavior can resolve the question from a strictly third-person perspective. Other types of cases illustrating the same point were also considered. I argued that neither the symbols nor the inferential roles they shared with one another, nor anything else available from a strictly third-person perspective were sufficient to secure the par ticularity of the representation. None could fix a particular object as the subject of a thought. Therefore, strictly third-person methodologies fail to solve the particularity problem. What has been said of symbols is with equal justification said of brain states, when they are considered from a strictly third-person perspective. 13 Indeed, the very idea of doing something for a purpose is one that presupposes the notion of representation in accordance with my (partial) analysis of represen tation, and as distinct from information bearing. This last concept and how it differs from representing will be explained in a section below and in a later section I show that teleological theories of representation that rely upon "naturally acquired functions" or purposes also fail. 14 If one is aware of the minimal content of one's thought then one is at least implicitly aware of a certain mapping. Alternatively, if one is aware of a particular mapping, one is also aware of a certain minimal content, the object of the thought determined by the mapping as conceived by the agent. So whether we speak of mappings or objects here is a matter of convenience determined by the context. 15 Compare the section, "Understanding, Explicating, and Individuating", in Georgalis (1996) and (chapter 1). The idea is that while objective content plays an important role in assessing an agent's understanding of a thought, as it does in individuating a thought in one sense, there is a logically prior sense of individuating the thought that depends on minimal content.</page><page sequence="42">322 NICHOLAS GEORGALIS 16 The uniqueness of minimal content in this regard will also provide for the res olutions of some problems for Quine regarding his theses of Indeterminacy of Translation and the inscrutability of reference, while at the same time generating new problems for him. I take up these issues in Georgalis (Chapter 7). 17 It is this regress that Armstrong, discussed above, attempted to block with his (unsuccessful) appeal to a claim that simple concepts are intrinsic representations. 18 I am grateful to John Bickle, whose persistent challenges, several years ago, to my claim that consciousness is required for representation contributed to my develop ment of the idea of a fundamental intentional state. 19 This is a standard notion of information. See, for example, Robert Van Gulick (1990, 109). Nothing that I say turns on this exact formulation. 20 I note that by the expression, "object of attention", I mean both "object" and "attention" to be understood from a first-person perspective. Compare earlier note 8, concerning the term "object". 21 Georgalis (1996) (chapter 2), I argue that functionalism generally, as well as a specific version of it, Van Gulick's (1988), fails to account for the special access we have to our own minimal contents. As to the inadequacy of teleological accounts of representation, see section below, "Clarification of the Scope of the Arguments". 22 Thomas Nagel makes similar points in his note 5 and the accompanying text of his (1980). 23 On a more optimistic note: If it turns out that consciousness is necessary for representation, as I hold, it is not implausible to suppose that at some stage of scientific development we could objectively identify what feature enables con sciousness in us. (See Georgalis (2000) (chapter 3) for a hypothesis as to a can didate for the sort of brain state that is promising in this regard.) We would then be able to determine which nonhuman animals also have this feature and, there fore, assuming that certain other factors that are in play when we represent are similarly realized, have strong grounds to hold that they also have similar repre sentational states. 24 An advocate of an exclusive third-person methodology who holds this view is Ruth Garrett Millikan (1989), discussed below. 25 Some variant of the appearance to which I refer is recognized and confronted by a number of authors. For example, even Dennett (1987), who wants a unified theory of all manner of representations, is concerned to explain the appearance of a dif ference in how we represent and how, say, thermostats do. He does so in terms of the kinds of connections to the environment and degree of complexity, to oversimplify a bit. Just how seriously Dennett takes the distinction is subject to interpretation, but that need not detain us. He revisits something like the distinction in his, "Real Patterns" (1991). Fred I. Dretske (1985, 1995) for another, focuses on an item having meaning in a system's cognitive economy versus its being assigned meaning by us. I certainly do not mean to suggest that Dretske and Dennett draw the same distinc tion, or that mine is the same as either of theirs. Indeed, it is not. The point is simply that they recognize the need to address some such distinction. Whether they are successful in drawing the distinction in a principled way that can address the points I identify as crucial to my distinction is another matter. In the next section, I argue that Dretske's and Millikan's manner of distinguishing information from represen tation are inadequate.</page><page sequence="43">REPRESENTATION AND THE FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE 323 Fodor (1986) also introduced a distinction that is somewhat in line with my dis tinction between information bearers and representers. His was between nomic properties - those which may enter into genuine laws, e.g., having mass, and nonnomic properties - those which do not enter into genuine laws, e.g., being a crumpled shirt. It is interesting and must be noted that Fodor no longer wishes to maintain this distinction, as he has come to think that it undermines an informa tional theory of content. I whole heartedly agree that it does - indeed, I think it equally undermines causal theories of content - but I, unlike Fodor, think both these theories of content should be rejected as a basis for a theory of representation. 26 Clearly, on my view information bearing states are representational simply in a metaphorical way that is parasitic on the genuine sense. Compare Searle (1983, 1992) who, as is well known, distinguishes intrinsic intentionality from both derivative and metaphorical intentionality. My debt to Searle on this and other matters is great. 27 We can, for example, account for the mere appearance that the Sun revolves around the Earth. What accounting for such appearances comes to is explained more fully in Georgalis, (1990), (1994), (chapter 1). 28 Interestingly, the polarity of the magnetosome is different depending on whether the bacteria in which they reside are in the northern or southern hemisphere. If this were not so, the bacteria in one or the other hemisphere would have died off, since they would be pulled in the wrong direction, toward oxygen-rich water. 29 Compare John R. Searle (1992, 93-97, 99-100) and Thomas Nagel (1980, 162 164; 1986, 32-37, 60-66) on the contrast between objectivity and subjectivity, and the importance of the first-person point of view in the study of human experience. 30 Although there is reason to think that even seriously abnormal humans have a first perspective on their own mental states, still, relatively normal people cannot reliably use their first-person states as a guide to the seriously abnormal person's first-person states, since there is reason (their verbal and nonverbal behavior) to think it is different from ours. I should add, however, that to the extent that one is abnormal, to that extent one's first-person perspective would be informative of others' subjective states that share that abnormality, assuming one also has the requisite cognitive abilities to make such inferences regarding one's own and others' abnormal behaviors. 31 I wish to express my thanks to two anonymous referees who read an earlier version of this paper and offered a number of useful comments. One of the referees was particularly demanding; the demands indicated a most careful reading of the manuscript, for which I am deeply grateful.
