This question prompted my study of the conceptual knowledge of problem solvers. Conceptual knowledge is factual knowledge. It is the knowledge of the mean- ings associated with concepts, laws and theories. For this study, to solve means to construct not only a correct answer but a scientifically meaningful solving course. A meaningful solving course is a sequence of problem-solving operations that is driven by concep- tual knowledge (Stewart 1982). By a scientifically mean- ingful solving course, I refer to a meaningful solving course that is driven expressly by conceptual knowl- edge that is both accurate and appropriate to the problem. The purpose of my study was to identify the conceptual knowledge of high school students who solved a significant problem about osmosis. The problem selected for this study is significant for both instruction and research in the domain of osmosis (see Figure 1). Firstly, the problem condi- tions have been displayed extensively in high school biology texts (e.g. Otto &amp; Towle 1985; Schraer &amp; Stoltze 1987). Moreover, similar osmotic systems are the basis for illustrations and laboratory activities in other textbooks and laboratory manuals [e.g. Biolog- ical Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), Yellow Ver- sion, 1980; Laboratory Inquiries, 1984]. Secondly, vari- ous researchers have used the conditions of this problem to explore students' conceptions about os- mosis (Johnstone &amp; Mahmoud 1980; Murray 1983). Osmosis is a fundamental but difficult concept for students to understand (Friedler, Amir &amp; Tamir 1987). Therefore, to enhance the likelihood for a correct answer and a scientifically meaningful solving course, I selected participants who were designated as outstanding science students. Teachers recom- mended students who were outstanding in science for both their overall conceptual knowledge and interest in problem solving. Presumably their concep- tual knowledge about osmosis could be useful for the majority of students to know. Conducting the Study Sixteen outstanding science students participated in this study. They were juniors and seniors in high school. Each had taken at least one science course during each year of high school. At least one of the courses was biology. The investigative procedure for each participant began with an individual clinical interview. The pur- pose of the interview was to explore the participant's conceptions, both accurate and inaccurate, about osmosis. Presumably the participant would use these conceptions to solve the problem. A Problem about Osmosis The figure below is a diagram of an inverted thistle top funnel which can be used to demonstrate osmosis. At the beginning of an experiment there is a dilute solution of sugar and water inside the funnel. An inelastic membrane perme- able only to water has been fitted across the immersed funnel opening. The funnel is surrounded by pure water. Make a graph to show how the solution level in the stem of the funnel changes with time. DILUrE SUGAR SOLUTION -..MEMBRANE == IRE WATER Figure 1.

I used records of these events to determine whether the solving course was scientifically meaningful. The solving course was so assessed if: 1. It consisted of a series of inferences through which the solver moved toward an answer. 2. The inferences were based on an essentially accurate representation of osmosis. Each think-aloud solving also generated a pencil- and-paper answer. I assessed this answer for correct- ness against a graph that served as the model answer (see Figure 2). Three attributes of the model answer were identified as the criteria for correctness (see Table 1). Accurate &amp; Inaccurate Conceptions About Osmosis Of the 16 outstanding science students who partic- ipated in this study, only two solved the problem. That is, only two constructed a scientifically mean- ingful solving course and a correct answer. This study is a report of the conceptual knowledge they displayed during their presolving clinical interviews. I refer to these participants as P1 and P2. PF's solving course appeared to be based on an entirely accurate representation of osmosis; P2's, on an essen- tially accurate representation. The conceptions about osmosis they disclosed during their interviews are displayed in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 is a list of their accurate conceptions. P1 expressed all 12. P2 expressed the subset that is underlined. P1 did not express any inaccurate con- ceptions about osmosis. Table 3 is a list of the inaccurate conceptions that P2 expressed. Thus P2 constructed a scientifically meaningful solving course and a correct answer despite some conceptual defi- ciencies about osmosis. Implications for Instruction About Osmosis The conditions of the problem posed for this study are often displayed in high school biology texts. Clearly the assumption is that most students can interpret these conditions correctly. Yet only two of 16 outstanding science students could generate both a scientifically meaningful solving course and a L E V E L 0 F 0 L U T 0 N TIME Figure 2. The model answer: Solution level as a function of time. Table 1. Criteria for correctness. 1. The horizontal axis of the graph represents time, and the vertical axis represents the level of the solution. 2. On the portion of the curve near the origin, the slope at each point is positive and decreasing, i.e. the curve is concave down. 3. On the portion of the curve distant from the origin, the slope at each point is zero, i.e. the curve is a horizontal line. Table 2. Accurate conceptions about osmosis expressed by P1: 1. Osmosis is the result of random molecular motion. 2. Osmosis is the net movement of water as it crosses both sides of the membrane. 3. The direction of osmosis is from regions of higher to regions of lower water concentration. 4. The concentration gradient of water affects how much water osmoses. 5. The concentration gradient decreases during osmosis. 6. The osmosis of water into a confined vessel increases turgor pressure. 7. The weight of an increasing height of solution imposes hydrostatic pressure on the solution. 8. Imposing pressure on a solution juxtaposed with water opposes osmosis. 9. The rate of osmosis decreases over time. 10. The rate of osmosis varies directly with the concentration gradient of water. 11. Water crosses both sides of the membrane at the same rate during osmotic equilibrium. 12. Osmotic equilibrium can be brought about by increasing the pressure imposed on the solution and/ or by decreasing the concentration gradient. Note: Conceptions also expressed by P2 are underlined.

I therefore concluded that most science stu- dents lack the necessary conceptual knowledge to interpret these conditions correctly. Random Motion &amp; the Net Movement of Water Some of the conceptions useful for interpreting these conditions are absent from most high school biology textbook discussions (Friedler, Amir &amp; Tamir 1985). There is often no account of osmosis as the result of random molecular motion and as the net movement of water as it crosses both sides of the membrane (Accurate Conceptions 1 and 2) (e.g. BSCS Blue Version 1980; BSCS Yellow Version 1980; Otto &amp; Towle 1985). In Biological Science: An Inquiry into Life (BSCS Yellow), osmosis is defined as, "The diffusion of water across a membrane between solutions of different concentrations," and diffusion is described as, the "movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration." Accordingly, P2 imagined osmosis as a one-way tele- ological/anthropomorphic movement of water. Conceptions of osmosis as the result of random molecular motion and as the net movement of the water, however, are necessary for rationalizing the significance of the concentration gradient across the membrane. Consequently, without these concep- tions, P2 came to challenge the significance of the concentration gradient. During the clinical interview, in response to an osmotic system, P2 asked, "How in the world could the (pure) water . . . tell that there's salt in there (in the solution across the membrane)?" P2 then constructed a personally meaningful model of osmosis that was driven by a difference in the amounts rather than the concentrations of water (Inaccurate Conception 2). Accordingly, she based inferences in the subsequent solving course on this somewhat distorted representation of osmosis. Despite the importance of understanding osmosis as the result of random molecular motion and as the net movement of the water, several of the partici- pants consistently proffered teleological/anthropo- morphic explanations for osmosis. They described the water as crossing the membrane "to try and make it (the concentrations) even," and to "wanna. . . get to equilibrium." Other researchers have documented the prevalence of secondary students' teleological/ anthropomorphic statements to describe osmotic sys- tems (Friedler et al. 1987; Johnstone &amp; Mahmoud 1980). Clearly the challenge is to provide the oppor- tunity for students to confront these primitive state- ments and to construct conceptions that can sensibly incorporate the concept of a concentration gradient. Equal Concentrations for Osmotic Equilibria Familiar textbook definitions also may mislead by implying that osmosis ends only when equal concen- trations have been reached-Inaccurate Conception 3 (e.g. BSCS Blue Version 1980; BSCS Yellow Version 1980; Otto &amp; Towle 1985). In Biological Science: A Molecular Approach (BSCS Blue), osmosis is defined as, the "diffusion of water through selectively permeable membranes," and diffusion is described as "a move- ment of molecules from an area of greater concentra- tion into areas of lesser concentration. The moving molecules continually collide and in the end become uniformly distributed." Accordingly, two participants who did not solve the problem, P3 and P4, were unable to construct a correct answer because they inferred that, under the problem conditions, an osmotic equilibrium could never be reached. Because the sugar and water were juxtaposed with pure water and the membrane was permeable only to the water, the opposing concen- trations could never equalize. Thus P3 and P4 sensibly constructed graphs that displayed a curve with a horizontal asymptote (see Figure 3) rather than a horizontal tangent. Hence their graphs did not con- form to the third criterion for correctness (see Table 1) and were assessed as incorrect. In contrast to P3 and P4, P2 was able to predict an osmotic equilibrium despite a belief in Inaccurate Con- ception 3. Interpreting an osmotic equilibrium in terms of equal amounts rather than equal concentrations of water, she could sensibly predict that the amounts of water would equalize across the membrane. Participants other than P2, P3 and P4 also expressed the belief that an osmotic equilibrium cannot be reached unless concentrations (or amounts) equalize across the membrane. Moreover, Friedler et al. (1987) reported that most students believe this conception to be true. Clearly the challenge is to provide students the opportunity to construct a more comprehensive conception of osmotic equilibria, one that can sensi- bly incorporate the concept of osmotic pressure. In summary, two outstanding high school science students constructed a scientifically meaningful solv- ing course and a correct answer to a significant Table 3. Inaccurate conceptions about osmosis expressed by P2. 1. Water teleologically/anthropomorphically osmoses in order to equalize concentrations (or amounts). 2. Different amounts of water across the membrane, rather than different concentrations, drive osmosis. 3. Osmotic equilibrium cannot be reached unless concentrations (or amounts) equalize across the membrane. 4. Water molecules cease moving across the membrane at osmotic equilibrium. Note: P1 did not express any inaccurate conceptions. 24 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 56, NO. 1, JANUARY 1994</page><page sequence="4">L E V E L 0 F 0 L U T 0 N TIMB Figure 3. P3's and P4's answer. problem about osmosis. This study has made some of their accurate and inaccurate conceptions about os- mosis explicit. Certain conceptions clearly affected the quality of their solving courses. These concep- tions included: 1. Random molecular motion and the net move- ment of water crossing both sides of a membrane 2. Osmotic pressure and its relationship to an osmotic equilibrium. Discussions of these two conceptions, however, are superficial at best in familiar high school biology texts. Therefore, teachers must provide other opportunities to enable students to construct these conceptions. References Biological Sciences Curriculum Study. (1980).

Actually, we get alot of ideas from teachers which is why we produced our VIDEO: SCOP'N -1 ". Because we realized that learning the microscope doesn't have to be "Boring", we went the extia mile to make SCOP'N-1" fun and exciting. Thafs why you'll see brilliant eye-catching microscopic photography incorporated with the sound of upbeat music. Your students will breeze through the nomenclature without even realizing they are learning all about the microscope. And at thfe end, there's an extro special bonus. A test (another idea given to us by teachers!!) You will be able to evaluate what they have just learned right off the video.
