An attempt is made in this paper to find out the role played by the tortoise in the Vedic mythology and ritual. Animals play a considerable part in the mythological and religious ideas of the Veda. Most of the Vedic deities are usually conceived as anthropomorphic, but still there prevail some theriomorphic con- ceptions of the deities. Actual animals in rituals are connected with mythological conceptions of the gods. "Animals, widely believed to have superior power, to sustain, for instance, the potency of vegetation, to have mysterious relations, to be a sort of reservoir of power for the socio-religious community, could even be representatives of the god whom they accompanied" (Gonda 1969:147). Totemism and all theriomorphic features involve problems of symbolism, imagery, and the conscious- ness of human personality in its relation to animal and other life. 1.1. In the Vedic mythology animals and birds, such as the horse (Dadhikrā or Dadhikrāvan, Târksya, Paidva, Etaša), the bull, the cow ( kāmadughā , kāmaduh, aghnyä), the goat, the ass, the dog, the boar, the tortoise, a monkey (Vrsākapi) , frogs, the eagle, serpent {ahi) in later Vedas sarpas, hold divine positions and supernatural powers. The tortoise is a reptile par excellence which plays a very significant role in the Vedic mythology and ritual. 2.0. Tortoise in the Vedic mythology Anthropomorphic, theriomorphic, and fétishístic conceptions are equally signi- ficant in the Vedic mythology. In the aetiological myths the animals possessed of sacrosanctity are closely associated. In many countries the turtle is considered as one of the mythical animals on which the world rests (see, e.g., N. W. Thomas in ERE.1.530) . Cosmogony in many savage religions is too well known. Every mythi- cal account of the origin of anything pre- supposes and continues the cosmogony (Eliade 1963:21). Cosmogonie myth in its essence constitutes a 'sacred history', which describes the beginnings of the world, the role which this primordial stage plays differs widelý in man's religious concep- tion (Kuiper 1970:91). Prajāpati, the creator, assumed the form of a tortoise to produce all creatures, and all creatures are said to have descended from the tortoise (šat Br. 7.5.1.5.) 1. He is identified with primeval Purusa from whom by means of the sacrifice the gods created the whole universe, and also men and gods. This tortoise is identified with the yonder sun (šat Br. 7.5.1.6) . The sun creeps over the, three worlds in the form of a tortoise (Šat Br. 7.5.1.9, etc.) . The tortoise is also said to be the (life) breath, for it creates all creatures (Šat Br. 7.5.1.7). In Vāja S. (13.31) the tortoise is raised to the position of 'lord of waters'. In ancient mythology the tortoise belonged to Varuna, the lord of waters, thereby it also became the lord of waters (Šat Br. 7.5.1.9) . In šat Br. (6.1.1,12) , in a cos- mogonie myth the life-sap (rasa) is identi- fied with a tortoise. "He (Prajāpati) de- sired 'May I generate this (earth) from the waters'! He compressed this (earth</page><page sequence="2">108 HUKÁM CHAND PATYAL which was in the embryonic form, or in the form of the egg-shell) and threw it into the waters. The juice (i.e. life-sap) which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was spurted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the waters. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the waters; all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely waters-". Again at Šat Br. (7.5.1.1) the tortoise is said to be the rasa (juice, i.e., life-sap) of these worlds, but in TaiS. (5.2.8.5) the tortoise is said to be the medha 'life-sap'3 (see Dumont 1957:17) of the (domestic) animals. The tortoise is regarded as a symbol of the three worlds (because of its shape). The lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world, the upper shell of it the yonder sky, and what is between (the shells) is the atmosphere (Šat Br. 7.5.1.2). In VājaS. (24.34= (K.) 26.7.4=MaiS. 3.14.15) the tortoise is said to belong to the Heaven and Earth4 (cf. šat Br. 7.5.1.10 where it represents heaven and earth) . In TaiÃ. (1.23.3) in a dialogue between the primordial Purusa and Prajā- pati, the creator, it is said that this purusa appeared in the waters in the form of a tortoise out of the bones and flesh of Prajā- pati.5 The sacrificial cake ( purodāša ) is said to have become a tortoise and started creeping about (TaiS. 2.6.3.3; cf. TaiS. 5.2.8.4; šatBr. 1.6.2.3) . We do get some idea of totemism or the belief in the descent of the human race or of individual families or tribes from animals. Kašyapa 'Tortoise' is the name of a seer (RV. 9.114.2), but he figures in the later Samhitās (see, e.g., AV. 1.14.4; 2.33.7; 4.20.7; VājaS. 3.62, etc.). He is of a hythical character. In AV. (19.53.10 = AVP. 12.2.10) Kašyapa is identical with the self-existent Prajãpatí. In Ait Br. (39.7) it is said that Višvakarman Bhau- vana promised the earth to Kasyapa (cf. Šat Br. 13.7.1.15; for Kasyapa, see Vedic Index, s.v.). According to PB. (15.5.30) by means of the sāman called Ākūpāra the seer Akū- pāra Kašyapa is said to have attained power and greatness. In JB. (3.273; cf. 3.203) the name ākūpāra is explained in a curious myth or legend. "Ākūpāra Kas- yapa (the tortoise Ākūpāra') descended together with the Kalis into the ocean. He sought in it a firm-footing (pratis(hā) .ü He saw the Ākūpāra sāman and landed with it. Thereupon he found a firm-footing in the ocean, viz., the earth. Thenceforth, the Kalis sit on his back. This Ākūpāra sāman is a firm-footing. The iChandoma (-days) are an ocean (because of a large number of stotriya-ve rses) , and Kasyapa (the Tortoise) is able to convey (them) across the ocean. This Ākūpāra sāman is for crossing over the ocean of the Chan- doma-days."7 This tortoise Kašyapa, of limitless dimension, is nothing but a cos- mic tortoise who finds this earth in the ocean (for various versions of cosmogony, see note 5) . 2.1. Tortoise in the modern Indian religion and folklore Throughout the world we do find many myths and rituals connected with the tor- toise or turtle. Many totemic beliefs are also connected with it (for details see ERE.1.530) . In India the tortoise is wor- shipped as a totem, or is sometimes sup- posed to save from calamities. In North India the Kācchis and the Kacchawaha Rajputs allege that they take their names from the Kacchapa or tortoise, similarly Kurmis also refer their name to i kūma (see Crooke 1896:2.149). The tortoise is a totem of the Mundari Kols. The Khar- wars and Mañjhis of Mirzapur worship</page><page sequence="3">TORTOISE IN THE VEDIC MYTHOLOGY AND RITUAL 109 clay images of it. The Gondas believe that their ancestor Lingo was saved by the tor- toise from the clutches of the alligator. In Kathā Sa Sāg. (12.15.4 ff.) there is a story where the sons bring a turtle for the sacrifice of their father, so that he can be saved from going to hell, etc. For a de- tailed account of such totemic beliefs con- nected with animals one may refer to (ERE. 1.483-535; Cooker (1896) and (1926) chapters on Animal worship). According to' Chaterji (1945:79) many images of Dharma in Bengal are just a figure of a tortoise. The word dharma is a Sanskritized form of the Austrie * durom, duram, * daram, darom 'tortoise'; cf. Ben- gali dura or duro (p. 79) . 3.0. Tortoise in the Vedic ritual Every big or anali act promised the sacrificer riches in cattle and offspring, long life and bliss in the next world. Thereby, it is that even the animals, in- animate objects and beings, sacrificial im- plements and vessels, etc. are employed very meticulously in the Vedic rites and they are kept in high esteem. Animal and plant kingdoms play very important part in various aspects of the Vedic rituals. Tortoise is a reptile par •excellence which is employed in or associated with many Vedic rites. 3.1. Tortoise in the Full- and New-moon sacrifices In the context or the baking of the sacri- ficial cakes, he (the Adhvaryu) should give (that ball) the shape of a tortoise while it is being flattened (Baudh ŠS. 1.9) . "He (the Adhvaryu) should make (each of the cakes) neither thick nor of the size of an i apūpa; he should make it resembling the form of a tortoise and of the measure- ment of a horse's hoof (Āpa ŠS. 1.25.4 = BhārŠS 1.26.2; cf. Mān ŠM. 1.2.3.22) .8 3.2. Tortoise in the context oj the Pumsa- vana rite In the Pumsavana rite he (the hus- band) puts gall of a tortoise ( kūrma • pitta) 9 on her (wife's) lap (PãrGS. 1.14.5) . If he desires 'May (the son) be- come valiant', he recites over him (i.e. over the embryo) modifying the rite(?) "Thou art, Suparņa" (Vāja S. 12.4) . 3.3. Tortoise in the Ašvamedha sacrifice In the horse sacrifice a number of ani- mals are enumerated which are tied to the sacrificial posts and in the intermediate spaces, with the names of deities or deified entities to which they are severally dedi- cated. In this ceremony there appears to be some sort of exaggeration in the num- ber of the animals which goes even up to 609 or more. Sometimes even impossible animals are also mentioned, "but it must be remembered that the Ašvamedha was a most important tribal solemnity of rare occurrence and that no effort would be spared to assure its performance with all possible splendour" (Griffith, YV. (tr.) ; p. 258, n.7; cf. Keith (1970:344-5)). In VājaS. (24.34 = (K) 26.7.4 = MaiS. 3.14.15) the tortoise is one of the animals tied to the sacrificial posts, and it is associated with the deities Heaven and Earth ( dyãvãprthiví ) . It is perhaps chosen because of its shape which resembles these two worlds, viz., heaven and earth. The oblation is made (in the Ašvamedha) of the roasted flesh, the various parts of the victim being assigned with the call of svõhã to a host of deities and other objects which are regarded as deified for the occa- sion. The hooves of the victim are offered to the (deities) tortoises with the formula</page><page sequence="4">110 HUKÁM CHAND PATYAL kürjmñ chaphaih (priņāmi ) ' (I gratify) tortoises with the hooves' (TaiS. 5.7.13.1 = MaiS. 3.15.3 = KāthS. 5.13.3 = Vāja- S. 25.3 = (K.) 27.3.1). In TaiS. (5.5.17.1) the enumeration of the victims to be tied to the sacrificial posts goes on, here the tortoise is offered to the months (cf. VājaS. 24.37; (K.) 26.8.2; MaiS. 3.14.18; Kāth S. 5.7.7). 10 Association of the tortoise with the months reminds one of the time which at the beginning gene- rated Prajāpati, the self-existent (AV. 19.53.10) . 3.4. Tortoise in the animal sacrifice In the animal sacrifice the parts of the victim are cut off in such a manner as to make either some animals or some other objects. In Ait Br. (6.6) details are given like this : "Make its (victim's) breast an eagle, its two front legs hatchets, its two fore feet spikes, its shoulders two tortoises, as it were, its loins uncut, its thighs two door leaves, its knees oleandar leaves; its ribs are twenty-six"11 (cf. MaiS. 4.13.4; KāthS. 16.21; TaiBr. 3.6.6.3; ŠānŠS. 5.17.5; MānŠS. 5.2.9.4). In ĀšvšS (1.3.3.1) it is described (under the Hautra relating to offering of the omentum) as the adhrigu-ca.il which is recited by the Hotr, viz., daivyãh samitāra ārabhadhvam uta manu$yā upanayata, etc. (see šrautakoša I:ii.830). In MānŠS. (5.2.9.4) it is des- cribed as modifications of words at the ani- mal sacrifice. As a matter of rule for the limbs of the two or more animals the plural is used (instead of dual, see MānŠS. 5.2.9.4) . 3.5. Tortoise in the Agnicayana rite The piling up of the fire-altar is one of the most important and elaborate cere- monies of the Vedic ritual. This rite is per- formed along with a Soma-sacrifice, but is obligatory in certain cases. At the bottom of this rite lie certain cosmogonie theories. In this article it will not be possible even to give some brief ritualistic details of the rite, only those parts of the rite will be dis- cussed wherein the tortoise is involved. 3.51. In the Agnicayana rite a tortoise is also immured alive in the altar. Accord- ing to Mān ŠS. (3.6.16) "If he cannot find a tortoise (for the piling up of the fire- altar) he should place a crab (karba) , if he cannot find it, he shall bake a purodāša in the shape of a tortoise and place parti- cles of gold used as elevation ( hiranyc • Pī4a), gold on both sides according to some on it." 3.52. The building up of the Âhavaniya fire-altar ( the first layer) He ( the Adhvaryu) lays down a lotus- leaf (in the centre of altar-site where the horse planted its hoof) (TaiS. 5.2.6.5; ŠatBr. 7.4.1.7ff.; ĀpaŠS. 16.22.3); and on that lotus-leaf the golden disc, worn by the sacrificer at the time of the Visņu strides during the initiation period, is placed (see ŠatBr. 6.7.1.1ff.) with brahma jajnānam (VājaS. 13.3; TaiS. 4.2.8.2). He puts down a golden man (i.e., golden im- age of a man) to the south of that golden disc with his head to the east and face turned to the sky, and he does not cover the entire golden disc, with the mantra 'in the beginning the Hiranyagarbha came in- to existence' (Vāja S. 13.4 = RV. 10.121.1; cf. ŠatBr. 7.4.1.19; TaiS. 5.2.7.2, etc.). With the sarpamma formulas (VājaS. 13.6-8; TaiS. 4.2.8.3) he (the sacrificer) pays homage to the serpents (see šat Br. 7.4.1.26 ff.; Ind St. 13.249). By the side of thé two arms of the golden man he (the Adhvaryu) places two srucs, one of kārš-</page><page sequence="5">TORTOISE IN THE VEDIC MYTHOLOGY AND RITUAL 111 rnarya filled with ghee on the right (i.e. south) side, and the other of udumbara filled with curds on the left (i.e. north) side with their tops to the east (TaiS. 5.2.7.2-3; Šat Br. 7.4.1.36-38) . The kārš- marya one he lays down with (VājaS. 13.13) , and the udumbara one with (Vãja- S. 13.14) . He (the sacrificer) puts down the naturally perforated brick ( svyamã - trņņā, i.e., the earth) 13 on the golden man (TaiS. 5.2.8.1; SatBr. 7.4.2.1-5). Sym- bolically it represents the vital air. Then the Adhvaryu lays down the Dūrvā-brick (TaiS. 5.2.8.2; SatBr. 7.4.2.10ff.) . That is to say, a stalk of dūr vã grass is laid upon the first naturally perforated brick in such a way that the root lies upon it and the tops hanging down to the ground (for de- tails see Eggeling SBE.XLI. 187, n.3; Ind- St. 13.249f.) . He lays down the Dviyajus- brick (to the east of dūrvā) with (Vāja S. 13.22-23; see SatBr. 7.4.2.16ff.) , two Retahsic-bricks to the east of the dviyajus with (VājaS. 13.24; see SatBr. 7.4.2.22ff.) ; he lays down the Višvajyotis brick between the two retahsic bricks" with (VājaS. 13.24; see SatBr. 7.4.2.25ff.) , then he places two Rtavyâ bricks with (Vāja S. 13.25; see SatBr. v7.4.2.29ff.) , then an Asādhā brick with (VājaS. 13.26; see SatBr. 7.4.2.32ff.; for the explanation of asādhā, see Sat Br. 6.5.3.1-2) to the east of the rtavyâ bricks. 3.53. Immuring the living tortoise An aratni to the south of the asādhā brick and to the east of the svyamãtmnã brick he (the Adhvaryu, acting for the sacrificer) places a living tortoise with its face towards the golden man (i.e. to the east) on the avakā (moss-like) plan s (Kāt- ŠS. 17.4.28; cf. Āpa SS. 16.25.1; Sat Br. 7.5.1. Iff.; TaiS. 5.2.8.5; KāthS. 20.7 = KapiKS. 31.9)." The avakā plants are like a tortoise (KātŠS 17.9.6) . In that the heads of the dead animals are deposited, a burial ground is made; in that he puts down a living tortoise, (thereby) he happens to be a non-maker of the burial ground (āšmašānacit) , the tortoise is fit for dwel- ling (TaiS. 5.2.8.5; cf. MaiS. 3.2.7) . The tortoise (which is said to represent the Sun or Prajāpati) is anointed with a mixture of ghee, honey and curds with the verses (VājaS. 13.27-29), and is enveloped in moss covered with a net and made nation- less by means of pegs (ĀpaSS. 17.25.2; HirSS. 11.7.41; SatBr. 7.5.1.4; TaiS. 5.2.8.6) . He puts it down with three verses (Vāja S. 13.30-32) , which express the wish that the tortoise may go to the deep waters, that the sün and fire may not torment it by heat, that it may reach, heavenly worlds and that divine rain may follow (SatBr. 7.5.1.8; ĀpaSS. 16.25.2; HirSS. 11.7.42; Kāt SS. 17.4.27; see Ind St. 13.250f.) . He then makes it move with (Vāja S. 13.31) . In fact, he sets the tortoise down with three verses; while muttering the second verse he makes it move while he still holds it in his hand (Sat Br. 7.5.1.9) . He then puts mortar and pestle of udumbara wood about one aratni north of the svyamãtmnã brick. 3.54. The mystery of the fire-altar ( num- ber of bricks in layers, etc.) According to Sat Br. (10.4.3.14) the first layer (or the altar) consists of ninety-eight (items) . He lays down the yajusmdti- bricks (with certain formulas) : grass bunch, the four clod-bricks, the lotus-le«^, the gold plate and man, the two offering spoons, naturally perforated brick, the dūrvā-brick, a dviyajus- brick, two retahsic- bricks, a višvajyotis, two rtavyâ ones, an asādhā, a tortoise, mortar and pestle, fire- pan, the five victims' heads, fifteen apasyâ- bricks, five chandasya-brxcks fifty pròna - bhrt- brides.</page><page sequence="6">112 HUKÁM CHAND PATYAL In a dialogue between Kušri Vâjaéravasa, Sušravas and others, the significance of putting certain objects in special directions or positions is shown (see Šat Br. 10.5.5.7 and 10.5.5.10, etc.) . 3.55. According to Baudh šuS. 9.1, one who wishes to conquer the world of Brah- man should construct the fire-altar in the shape of a tortoise, this is the tradition. The tortoises are said to be of two types, viz., those with angular limbs ( vakrãúgas ) , and those round ones ( parimaņdalas ) , the same are the limbs of the fire-altar (Baudh ŠuS. 9.2) . No part of the tortoise should be eaten, other aquatic animals like fish etc. should also not be eaten. Thus, one who knowing this piles up this Āruņaketaka fire, for him the waters and the water-animals become harmless (TaiĀ. 1.26.7). In a way, this is a totemic belief, and this, reptile is held in high esteed. 4.0. Résumé (i) In the Vedic mythology and ritual the tortoise holds divine position and pos- sesses supernatural powers. PfajāpaH assuming the form of a tortoise, created the universe and all creatures. (ii) The tortoise is identified with the yonder sun. Because of its shape it repre- sents the three worlds, viz., the earth, at- mosphere and sky. It is considered as the life-sap of animals, because it is itself an animal; moreover the (domestic) animals represent this earth and the (wild) ani-mais tie yonder world. (iii) In the Vedic ritual the totfoise plays quite a significant role. In the most elaborate ceremony of the Agnicayana it is immured alive in the altar. It symbolics the act of the cosmogonie myth. In the Ašvamedha one of the parts of the victims is offered to the tortoises. In the animal sacrifice kwrma is one of the animals tied to the sacrificial posts, and it belongs to the Heaven and Earth. In sum, the tortoise is a reptile par ex- cellence which plays a very significant role in the Vedic mythology and ritual.

Sat Br. 7.5.1.10. 5 For various theories of the first creation, one may refer to Kuiper (1970:98ff.) . According to one of the theories the earth was the result of a process of co- agulation (cf., e.g., JB.3.360; BrĀraU. 1.2.2, etc.) . The second theory is that of mundane egg, which is either connected with the coagulation of the waters or the Creator. For various versions of this myth, see, e.g., Šat Br. 11.1.6.1-2; JB.3.360; JUB.1.56.1; ChāndoU. 3.19.1, etc. The third theory relates that a cosmogonie boar brought some mud upward from the bottom of the Waters, which in the beginning became the beginning of the Earth. This ver- sion of cosmogony is found in YV. texts (see, e.g., MaiS. 1.6.3; KāthS. 8.2; KapiKS. 6.7; TaiS. 7.1.5.1; TaiBr. I.2.1.3; ApaSS. 5.1.7; TaiĀ. 10.1.8, etc.) . In the Iroquois myth the turtle brought Aataentsic on her back when she fell from the heaven. Thus with the aid of mud and sand brought up by water-fowl the earth was formed (see ERE. 1.530) . 6 On the meaning and significance of the term prctisthā, see e.g., Gonda (1975: II.338-74). 7 See, e.g., Keith (1970:240) ; Caland's note on PB. 15.5.30. 8 For a very exhaustive account of the baking of the sacrificial cake, see Šrauta- koša (Eng. Sec.) I :i. 285-90. 9 The expression kūrmapittam is under- stood by some of the commentators as 'dish with water (see Karka: kürmapit- tašabdenodakašarāvam ucyate) . MW 'a vessel with water'. I follow here Oldenberg, see his note on this siitra in SBE.29.292. The tortoise is able to exert fertilizing influences (cf. Gonda 1969:127) . Tortoise is associated with a number of totems of sexual nature. 10 TaiS. 5.5.17.1 reads anyaväpo'rdhamä- sānām māsām kašyapah . . whereas VājaS. 24.37 reads anyaväpo' rdhamā- sānām ršyo mayürah suparņas te gan- dharvāņām udrò māsām, kašyapo rohit puņdrņācī goiattikā te'psarasām mrt- yavčsitahl Griffith "The cuckoo be- longs to the Half Months; antelope, peacock, eagle, these are the Gandhar- vas ; the otter belongs to the Months; tortoise, doe-antelope, iguana, Golattikā belong to the Apasarases; the black snake belongs to the death." Really speaking the correct rendering of apām udrò māsām kašyapah should be "the otter belongs to the waters, the tortoise to the months'; see Uvata and Mahī- dhara kašyapah kacchapah māsānām. 11 Ait Br. 6.6 šyenam asya naksah krņu- tāt prašasā bahü šalā dosant kašyape - vāmsācchidre šroņī havasorü srekapar- ņāsthivantā sadvimšatir asya vañkra- yah/ Sāyaņa renders prašasā bāhū as prakrstacchedanau kuruba/ . . . šalā as šalākākārau, and kavasorū as kavasā- kārāv ūrū, for kams cf.

(tr.) cxxv-cxxxi; Dumont (1951: 629- 75). 13 The three svyamätrmuis in the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers repre- sent the three worlds, viz., the earth, atmosphere and heaven (SatBr. 9.5.1.58). 14 According to Eggeling (SBE.XLI.385,</page><page sequence="8">114 HUKÁM CHAND PATYAL fn.l) "In reality the Višvajyotis brick is not placed between the two retahsic, but in front of the line separating them from each other". 15 On various mythological beliefs con- nected with tortoise, see 2.0 and 2.1 of this paper. Prajāpati in the form of a tortoise created the universe, that is why in this rite, which symbolically creates the universe, this reptile is chosen. Moreover, the world is sup- posed to rest upon tortoise (as an in- carnation of Visņu) . The turtle both in America and in Asia is one of the mythical animals on which the world rests (ERE. 1.530) . The custom of placing living animals, sometimes even human beings, under the foundations of a house or of a bridge, etc. to secure its stability is of very great antiquity and was formerly wide spread (see Gri- ffiith's note on VājaS. 13.30). Keith (1970 : 355, n.l) remarks "This prac- tice may clearly be connected with the recorded discovery of toads living inside rocks, etc." I do not agree with it. It is chosen because of its fertilizing in- fluence, and due to its association with the myth pertaining to cosmogonie creation.* * Paper read in the Vedic section of the 29th session of the All-India Oriental Conference held in Pune in June 1978.
