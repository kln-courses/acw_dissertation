<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROJECTION ARTHUR CHILD I SOME WORDS enter the language with an uncommon aptitude both for uniting things already observed but formerly severed by separate terms and for fostering the recognition of things unnoticed before. Indeed, they often unite things that ought still to be left discrete; and even among those properly united, clarity may require the acknowledgment of many distinctions. I shall here consider such a term and the various kinds of things to which it can and cannot (in the same sense) refer: projection. The currency of projection in English no doubt derives in large measure from its use by Evans in her translation (1854) of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity. She used it to express the meaning of Vergegenstdndlichung, that is, objectification: God is the projection of qualities drawn from the nature of man himself. It also served her for Entatisserung: Hegel's notion that man's consciousness of God is God's self-consciousness rests auf diesem Processe der Selbst- entaiisserung, 'on this process of projecting self outwards'. Entaiisserung signifies the alienation of a thing in the sense of parting with its ownership. Marx, however, in his IVth Thesis on Feuerbach, refers to the same self-alienation as Selbstentfremdung, which signifies the alienation of a person in the sense of becoming a stranger. But when I alienate a part of myself, the two senses coincide; and Evans could use projection rather than alienation for the coincidence because the thought of objectifying, for which she had already used project, is precisely the thought of making a part of oneself into an object outside oneself, no longer one's own, a stranger. With the objectifying and the estranging we must combine one further connotation-that at least on initial view there is some dubiety or impropriety, some sort of anomaly, about the status of the thing projected. Projection thus means that anomalously (whether in fact or in seeming) the subject adds from his own being to the world of legiti- mate objects something which, within the act of projecting, he takes to be other than himself and fails to distinguish from what it supple- ments. For convenience I shall use 'objects' for 'objects in the outer world', but one can supplement in the same way the objects of introspection. I say 'within the act of projecting' because outside of the act, philosophising, one can acknowledge the supplement as one's self-projection, while within the act one still apprehends the projected self as alien. Each of the remaining elements of the 20</page><page sequence="2">PROJECTION definition radiates into ambiguities that answer to different theories of projection. We shall examine certain of these theories and some of the problems concerned. First, some irrelevancies must be cleared away: the more prominent among the processes (or alleged processes) which are described as projective (or might plausibly be) but which do not conform with our definition. There is, as Strong puts it, the 'old doctrine of the physiologists that sense-data are brought before us by the "projection" of states of mind called "sensations" '.1 Though the sensations are appre- hended as outside the mind, they actually, according to this doctrine, are not outside. In consequence, a misapprehension does occur. But since the mistake affects outer experience in its entirety, nothing is priorly present for the projected sensations to supplement. With regard to inner experience, Strong observes that 'when the sensations themselves become objects of awareness, they are not referred to a place outside us, as in perception, but to the place where the corre- lated nervous process occurs. . . . There will be projection, or rather introjection, because the reaction refers the state to a place within us.'2 But applying as it does to all introspection, this introjection does not presume a division of inner experience into supplemental and supplemented. The definition excludes the adding of secondary qualities to primary in the ordinary notion of the process. By that notion the ontic status of the two classes is of the same subjective sort; though they represent objective characters in different ways, both of them exist solely within experience. The process exhibits no anomaly. Nor is mirage an instance. The subject does not project the mirage in distinction from its undeceptive background. Here the false appearance is as truly given as the true appearance. The perceptual theory of Kant is not projectionist. The forms of sensibility and the categories are not added to, they are a pre- condition of, the world of experienced objects. Hence neither are they present within experience, where alone they could be confused with each other. Is experience, then, in the entire phenomenal world, projected? Since there is nothing to which it could be added, there is nothing from which it could fail to be distinguished; for the other or noumenal world lies beyond all possibility of experience. Likewise with Plato's theory of perception. As Strong uses our term, 'projection is not the actual conveyance of the sensations to a place outside; it is the conjuring up of a vision of something there 'C. A. Strong, Essays on the Natural Origin of the Mind (London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1930), p. 30. 2lbid., pp. 38 f. 21</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY -a phantasm'.' But for Plato something is literally conveyed with- out, a passive motion according to the Theaetetus, a fiery stream according to the Timaeus. By either account the something sent forth is in no sense less legitimate than the active motion or the daylight that plays its partner; the birth of the twins, seeing and quality seen, supposes no less the one parent than the other. Nor are the partners confused within sensation, being fused before sensation-or at least mated. Projections in the sense defined are of two sorts. There are those on which empirical evidence bears, and there are those that can only be argued, pro or con, dialectically-I mean from ontological and epistemological convictions, which themselves are subject to the same sort of reasonable examination. Both of the great classes divide again. The situation that would present an anomaly if it existed may, in view of the anomaly, be denied to exist; alternatively, the anomaly may be accepted as a fact of existence. Among the projections susceptible in principle of empirical study, there is one group, comprising certain eidetic images, whose anomalous character is clearly genuine. It is true that eidetic images Care not in general confused with real objects. In the majority of cases they merely have the character of pictures, which, nevertheless, are seen in the literal, optical sense.... It must be added, though, that solid objects are not necessarily always seen two-dimensionally. ... Very often they are seen three-dimensionally.'2 And I presume that the rare failures to distinguish projection from perception would occur most often with three-dimensional images. Here the psycho- logist should be able to establish before his empirical conscience the fact of a projection. His experience will require him to accept the anomaly: an image is perceived with full objective status. From this true objectification of certain eidetic images, we must distinguish the projection which is believed, rather than perceived, to exist in one's perceived world. The investigator can establish (for himself, as a scientist) the absence of the projection from the perceived world of his subject, because there is evidence that the anomaly is only believed to be perceived. The Trobriand Islanders studied by Malinowski, though ignorant of biological fatherhood, believed that children resemble their father; and they even claimed to perceive resemblances where Malinowski could not perceive them. ... Yet there was behavioural evidence that the Trobriander did not 'Ibid., p. 33. 2E. R. Jaensch, Eidetic Imagery, trans. Oscar Oeser (London: Kegan Paul, 1930), pp. 15 f. Throughout the essay, italics in quotations stand for emphases in the texts quoted. 22</page><page sequence="4">PROJECTION perceive all the resemblances he believed he perceived.1 The anomaly, the perception of what the ethnologist did not perceive, was unreal. The empirical types have little need of analytic and reflective attention. It is different with the types one can only discuss from convictions about the relevant form of apprehension (theoretical, religious, perceptual, aesthetic, or whatever) and about the nature of things. I shall therefore devote the rest of my space to the dia- lectical types. By a common definition the empirical class is limited to the sensible world, but that limitation does not hold of the dialectical class. The latter separates into nonsensuous and sensible forms, and each of these divides into forms that reject and forms that accept the anomaly. II It is anomalous to believe that outside the human mind or personality and within the world studied by natural science (as the scientificist interprets the world) there exists a nonsensuous some- thing not experienced as part of the natural order. Add to the belief the claim that its content derives from something within the believer, and one identifies a projection. This nonsensuous projectionism concerns the divine. There is no reason in principle for its confine- ment to that subject. However, unperceived sprites or even bogies and devils, little believed in and socially unimportant, do not stimulate the minds of distinguished theorists. It is God that they think about. To say with the theistic projectionists that God is the projection or objectification of human qualities is to stand in some relation to those who have criticised anthropomorphism in theology. The line of these thinkers extends back to Xenophanes, who chanted: but if oxen and horses or lions had hands and drew with their hands, did a drawing as men do, horses like horses, oxen like oxen would they draw the god-shapes, making the bodies just like the frames they have themselves [fr. 15]. Even so, despite the thought of these boumorphic, hippomorphic, leontomorphic, anthropomorphic representations, when he sang of one god, among gods and men the greatest, neither in frame like mortals nor in mind [fr. 23], Xenophanes must have believed in the reality of the divine. And 1I have examined the problem in detail in a paper, 'The Sociology of Perception', Journal of Genetic Psychology, 1950, 77, 293-303. 23</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY that is where most of the theistic projectionists differ from the traditional critics of anthropomorphism. The tradition criticises a concept of the divine for its human content, that is, for its inadequacy. The common sort of theistic projectionism denounces it for existing at all: the anthropomorphism of the concept proves the unreality of its object and thereby the invalidity of the concept itself. Of the various forms of theistic projectionism, I have already mentioned the version of Feuerbach (1841), for whom religion, at least the Christian, is the relation of man to himself, or more correctly to his own nature (i.e. his subjective nature); but a relation to it, viewed as a nature apart from his own. The divine being [Wesen] is nothing else than the human being, or, rather, the human nature [Wesen] purified, freed from the limits of the individual man, made objective-i.e. contemplated and revered as another, a distinct being. All the attributes of the divine nature are, therefore, attributes of the human nature.' It seems clear that the human nature which in the religious systole man propels from himself, in the religious diastole receives into his heart again,2 is the nature of the species. So the translator glossed the text.3 So Marx understood it. Here is the point, indeed, of Marx's criticism in the VIth and VIIth of his Theses on Feuerbach (1845): 'Feuerbach dissolves the religious being into human nature. But human nature is no abstrac- tion indwelling in the separate individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations.' Since, however, Feuerbach does not criticize this real nature, he can grasp it only 'as "species", as an inner, mute universality that unites the many individuals naturally', unable to see 'that the "religious spirit" is itself a social product and that the abstract individual he analyses belongs to a definite form of society'.4 Marx's criticism suggests an explication of the term 'God' as naming, and naming only, any of a number of concrete projections, that is, projections of the human nature of various particular forms of society. It is therefore interesting to hear Engels discuss religion in 1878, a third of a century later. He defines it thus: 'All religion is nothing other than the reflection in men's heads of those external powers that rule their everyday life, a reflection in which the earthly powers take on a super-earthly form'. Early in social evolution there is polytheism, whose fantastic 'Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, trans. M~arian Evans, chap. I, sec. 2 (German text, chap. II), para. 4. 2lbid., next to last para. 3Ibid., Evans XXI (German XXII), para. 5. 4Marx/Engels Gesamtausgabe, Abt. I, Bd. 5 (Berlin: Marx-Engels Verlag, 1932), 535. 24</page><page sequence="6">PROJECTION shapes first reflect the mysterious forces of nature but then receive social attributes. So far the account seems promising. However, Engels goes on to say that 'at a still further stage of development the natural and social attributes of the many gods are transferred collectively to one all-powerful god, who himself again is only the reflection of abstract man'.' This brings in two incoherencies: Monotheism and the definition of religion fail to fit each other, since surely the abstract man is not an external power. And when Engels speaks of religion in the abstract he is a Marxist, but when he presents monotheism as a reflection of abstract man-monotheism, which extends through so many forms of society-he reverts to Feuerbachianism pure. Still, the possibility of going beyond exists. The forces of nature appear again in Freud, humanised that they can be dealt with like persons, then given the character of a father so as to do justice to the overwhelming impression they make. In time, with the recognition of nature's regularity, the forces 'lost their human traits. But man's helplessness remains and along with it his longing for his father, and the gods.' Thus runs the 1927 account in The Future of an Illusion.2 The account runs differently in the Totem and Taboo of 1913, where Freud had elaborated on the father. It seems that one day the brothers of the primal patriarchal horde killed and ate their father and thus made an end of the horde, but they founded religion by instituting the totem meal in commemora- tion of the act. The sons then substituted a totem animal for the father and, by placing a taboo on the taking of its life, attempted to allay their guilt. Eventually the totem, the first form of father- surrogate, was replaced by a later form, the god, 'in which the father has regained his human shape'. And apparently this projection of the father-image occurs anew with each person, since 'the psycho- analysis of individual human beings ... teaches us with quite special insistence that the god of each of them is formed in the likeness of his father, that his personal relation to God depends on his relation to his father in the flesh and oscillates and changes along with that relation, and that at bottom God is nothing other than an exalted father'.3 Should the personal relations to the father fall into types characteristic of certain societies and correlated with certain con- ceptions of God, Freud would thus offer the possibility of a psycho- analytic theology parallel to the Marxian. 1Friedrich Engels, Herrn Eugen Diihrings Umwdlzung in det Wissenschaft, part III, chap.

Still, if God is man, why not worship Humanity? Comte makes the proposal explicitly in the 1850's. It is a nonprojective proposal, since humanity, though including the worshipper, is palpably outside and all about him. Room therefore remains for a projective proposal. Recognising the projection as projective and human, one is nonetheless to acknow- ledge it as God; one can yet count oneself among the godly. Perhaps the place has been filled by Dewey. If we cannot tell for sure what Dewey is saying, that matters little; what matters here is the possibility, be it found by a true interpretation or invented by a false. Dewey asks 'whether the power and significance in life of the traditional conceptions of God are not due to the ideal qualities referred to by them, the hypostatisation of them into an existence being due to a conflux of tendencies in human nature that converts the object of desire into an antecedent reality. . .'. And it appears to him 'more credible that religious persons have been supported and consoled by the reality with which ideal values appeal to them than that they have been upborne by sheer matter-of-fact existence'.' The worth of religion must therefore derive rather from the values than from the existence, from 'some prior complete embodiment'. Let the idea of God, then, or of the divine, be 'one of ideal possibilities uni- fied through imaginative realisation and projection'. If in our sense 'projectionism' does cover the proposal of Dewey himself (as distinguished from the construction he puts on traditional theism), the anomaly will lie between the imagined realisation of the ends and the existent conditions into which they are projected but in which they are not completely embodied. On the next page it is no longer the projected ideals but the 'active relation between ideal and actual to which I would give the name "God" ,2 Thirty years of reflection on the two pages leave me convinced that in truth they propose two theologies, of which one adopts the existence and the other the ideality of traditional theism. The active relation of the second theory exists, but as existing it is not ideal; the ideal unity of the first theory, as what is yet to be realised, does not exist. Both theories would fittingly be called either atheistic theisms or theistic atheisms. But the first theory alone seems projective or conceivably so. Feuerbach, Marx, Freud, and Dewey make a fair sample of the atheistic projectionists. Each, I presume, wishes us to suppose that he has searched the external world and found that the thing termed God is not there. If it is not where it seemed to be, it might not be what it seemed to be. Where is it? Each supposedly discovers the 'John Dewey, A Common Faith (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1934), pp. 43 f. "Ibid., pp. 49-51. 26</page><page sequence="8">PROJECTION thing in his mind or, if not, discovers that it exists in other people's minds. Each then examines the thing, and each identifies it. The thing is a set of attributes of the human species, it is the resultant within the social everyman of all the relations in which his society consists, it is the likeness of Father, it is the ideal ends. But how, examining the same object, can our scientists report such divergent observations? Does the same object contain all that all four announce? If so, how did each of the observers detect only a quarter of what was there? If not, if there is a single simple object to observe, how could the three scientists other than Feuerbach or Marx or Freud or Dewey go so wrong? Or is the truth rather that there are four objects? Each theorist will reaffirm his own correcti- tude. And we shall repeat the questions. Then consider the statement that God is one or another of the four identifications. The statement functions ambiguously. In some degree it sounds plausible as meaning that the idea of God comprises these traits or consists in an image of the father or in the unification of ideal ends; and one identification or another is doubtless true of someone's idea of God-it is doubtless true of Feuerbach's, of Marx's, of Freud's, of Dewey's. But the refutatory force of the statement depends on the supposition that the object of the idea of God is composed of human traits, is a likeness of the father, is the unity of ends. For that leads to absurdity. Sticks and stones and stars and phlogiston and the luminiferous ether, all of the things that the physical science of the moment endorses, are legitimately in the world; but human characters apart from the men they characterise, father-images apart from the minds that image the father, ends-in- view apart from a viewer of ends, are not in the world at all. Un- aware of the tergiversation, a disciple ingenuously substitutes the plausibility of the first meaning for the implausibility of the second and then, under the guidance of his elected master, gladly escapes from the resultant absurdity into atheism. Let us put the argument formally. Disentangling its structure from the several versions, we immediately recognise the fallacy of four terms: Whatever is a thought is not a non-thought; God [in the sense of a thought] is a thought; hence God [in the sense of a non-thought] is not a non-thought. This argument I call the atheist's paralogism. But supposedly the non-existence of God has been established both empirically and rationally. The atheist of the present type goes on to explain the fact that men do persistently believe in the existence 27</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY outside themselves of a supreme holy object. For now there exists nothing outside them with an 'actual or formal reality', as Descartes would say, sufficient to have caused the belief. Deceptions worked by the priests would provide an explanation, and I daresay that all our thinkers suspect the priesthood. But they supplement social psychology by individual psychology: they hypothesise a projec- tive act of the imagination, which produces the semblance of an outer object. By thus explaining the misbelief, projectionism preserves atheism from an implausible consequence-the complete in- credibility of theism. However, no one has observed the act of projection, directly or indirectly. It is pure hypothesis, credible only through the sorts of circumstances from which nonempirical hypotheses in general acquire credibility. But the convergence of the four thinkers on the projective hypothesis happens to be nonsignificant: the others must all have read Feuerbach. Besides the atheist versions of theistic projectionism, there is a theist form, suggested at various places in Unamuno's The Tragic Sense of Life (1912). In a way, indeed, one might take him to agree with the atheists: there is no God-such as they conceive God. The God of Aristotle, he declares, '. . . the rational god, is the projection [proyeccion] to the outward infinite of man as he is by definition-that is to say, of the abstract man, of the man no-man . . .'.1 On the design argument Unamuno comments that it 'resolves itself fundamentally into hypostatising or substantivating the explanation or reason of a phenomenon. .. . But the God who is the result of this process, a God who is nothing but reason hypostatised and projected toward the infinite, cannot possibly be felt as something living and real, nor yet be conceived of save as a mere idea which will die with us.'2 And Unamuno should pass the same judgment on the conceptions of God we have found in Feuerbach and Marx and Freud and Dewey. Again, while each of these four defines God differently, each does seek to define him. But 'to seek to define Him is to seek to confine Him within the limits of our mind-that is to say, to kill Him. In so far as we attempt to define Him, there rises up before us-Nothing- ness.'3 As Unamuno might say, the result is a God no-God. But a no-God God is not the God in whom Unamuno believes. Rather, the '. . . universal longing of all human souls who have arrived at the consciousness of their humanity, . . . [their] effort to 'Miguel de Unamuno, The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and in Peoples, trans. J. E. Crawford Flitch (London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1921), p. 4. 2Ibid., p. 162.

Unamuno says that projection leads us to God; that is, it is the means of knowing God. 'The knowledge of God proceeds from the love of God ..;" but either love results in projection, objectification, personalisation, or these are all just different names for a single thing: '. . . the revelation of this Supreme Consciousness in our feeling and imagina- tion, by love, by faith, by the process of personalisation, is that which leads us to believe in the living God'. The existence of God cannot be proved by reason, but the belief in Him is not delusory. Unamuno does believe. The living God 'lives in us, and we live and move and have our being in Him. And He is in us by virtue of the hunger, the longing, which we have for Him, He is Himself creating the longing for Himself.'" How is it that Unamuno can differ from the other projectionists? For them, the subjective is the subjective and nothing more; and, God being the idea of God, God except as idea does not exist. But not all philosophers accept this divorce of subjective and objective with respect to God. Anselm does not, Descartes does not. To God's essence, existence belongs necessarily; that there is an idea of God, which is to say a divine essence, shows forth that the most perfect being exists not only in idea but in reality. I suppose Unamuno would remark that the God of Anselm and Descartes is a defined and therefore an unbelievable God. Also, whereas for them it is a matter of proving what they believe, for him it is a matter not of proof but of the believing. Both sides, nonetheless, refuse to sever the objective and the subjective. Unamuno explains that the divine 'was not originally something objective, but was rather the subjectivity of consciousness projected exteriorly, the personalisation of the world. The concept of divinity arose out of the feeling of divinity, and the feeling of divinity is simply the dim and nascent feeling of personality vented [vertido, that is, poured, cast] upon the outside world.' But then he qualifies the distinction: 'And strictly speaking it is not possible to speak of outside and inside, objective and subjective, when no such distinction was actually felt; indeed it is precisely from this lack of distinction that the feeling and concept of divinity proceed. The clearer our consciousness of the distinction between the objective and the subjective, the more obscure is the feeling of 'Ibid., pp. 166 f. 2lbid., p. 177. 29</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY divinity in us.'1 Unamuno's projection serves, then, to express that effacing of the distinction between subjective and objective which allows us to 'have at times the direct feeling of God, above all in moments of spiritual suffocation'.2 III The second type of dialectical projectionism concerns the per- ceptual world. A colour area is related to that world in one way; the vital assumption that on the other side of a coloured object there is the other side, not of a colour area but of a body, is related to the perceptual world in another way. The colour area is a constituent part of the perceptual world; the vital assumption is a constitutive principle. I shall take these examples as guides, and I shall assign a projection to the present category if analogous either to a colour area or to the consequence for the perceptual world of the vital assumption about the other side of the coloured object. Of course there are other kinds of things in the world of experience besides perceptible objects and the effects of our determinative assumptions about them: actions and thoughts; the mystic's God. But I shall not try to examine instances of other empirical projections than the perceptual. My first instance I shall draw from Hume (1739). He has intro- duced the paradox that the efficacy of causes belongs entirely to the soul, though philosophers place it in the causes themselves, in God, or in their concurrence. Now the placing of efficacy in the causes, though a projection of the first dialectical type as philosophers treat it, is clearly an instance of the second type as a natural tendency in ordinary experience. But I leave that aside. Hume alludes to a projection of sensory materials when he goes on to account for the paradox: . . . the mind has a great propensity to spread itself on external objects, and to conjoin with them any internal impressions, which they occasion, and which always make their appearance at the same time that these objects discover themselves to the senses. Thus as certain sounds and smells are always found to attend certain visible objects, we naturally imagine a conjunction, even in place, betwixt the objects and qualities, tho' the qualities be of such a nature as to admit of no such conjunction, and really exist no where.3 Note that the talk of the mind's 'spreading' itself on external objects 'Ibid., p. 157. 2lbid., p. 168. 3David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. Selby-Bigge (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1888), p. 167. 30</page><page sequence="12">PROJECTION or 'conjoining' with them internal impressions provides a good pair of synonyms for projection; that the reference to the conjoining of internal 'impressions' with objects which discover themselves to the 'senses' shows the concern of Hume with the perceptual world; and that the ascription to the mind of a 'propensity' to do something indicates his intention to examine, not a set of philosophical opinions, but a group of vital beliefs. And it is evident by which of the two analogies I assign this projection to the perceptual category. In consequence of a natural propensity of the mind, we apprehend smells and tastes as though they were localised: we project them into the intolerant company of spatial qualities. The projection does not consist in making them a part of the externally perceived world like a colour area. This world is what it is, and what it is does not include qualities that exist nowhere, no more than it includes the other sides of coloured objects or the efficacy of causes. The projection consists rather in taking smells and tastes as part of the externally perceived world, in con- sequence of the belief that they are what they are not and cannot be. Hume promises to discuss the illustration more fully hereafter, and he returns to it in the chapter on the immateriality of the soul, where, when he raises the question about the connection of the soul with matter at a place, he suggests that '. . . it may not be improper to consider in general what objects are, or are not susceptible of a local conjunction'.' Manifestly those things alone can be joined in place which exist in place, which are themselves extended. But only what is coloured or tangible is extended; only these, by their own nature, convey to us the idea of space. Any other sort of impression-a taste or a sound, for instance-is followed by spatial ideas solely in consequence of custom and reflection. It needs no proof that such perceptions, which exist without existing in any place, are 'incapable of any con- junction in place with matter or body'. Yet not only in disquisitions on the soul but in common life we somehow join the unjoinable. Thus supposing we consider a fig at one end of the table, and an olive at the other, 'tis evident, that in forming the complex ideas of these substances, one of the most obvious is that of their different relishes; and 'tis as evident, that we incorporate and conjoin these qualities with such as are colour'd and tangible. The bitter taste of the one, and sweet of the other are suppos'd to lie in the very visible body, and to be separated from each other by the whole length of the table.2 This conjunction Hume then refers to as a 'notable and natural 'Ibid., p. 235. 'Ibid., p. 236. 31</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY illusion'. In considering 'the principles, from which it is deriv'd', Hume elaborates as follows: Already the colour and tangibility of a piece of fruit and its taste and smell, the extended object and the qualities that exist nowhere, are united by the relations of causation and of contiguity in the time of their appearance. Hence on the appearance of one set of qualities the mind will immediately think of the other. But to make the transition more easy and natural, to strengthen the connection between the two objects, we 'feign' likewise the relation of a conjunction in place.' Hume's intellectualistic way of speaking could suggest that he supposes himself to be occupied with a consciously rational construc- tion on the order of Newton's system of celestial mechanics. To the contrary, he knows that he has to do with the instinctive, un- reflective processes of ordinary experience, with a natural illusion, which retains its power in the experiencing of Hume while the erroneous systems of the heavens have lost all power over the thinking of Newton. It would also be misleading to take over-strictly the terms 'incorporate' and 'conjoin', which are somehow or somewhere metaphorical; or to take 'illusion' in the most common sense of a falsity in perceiving, since the falsification occurs in another process. Where does it occur? And in what respect are the incorporating and the conjoining metaphorical? The answer to the first question will show the answer to the second. The falsity is one of belief. We erroneously, though naturally, believe that the sweetness is located in the fig, that the bitterness is located in the olive, and that between the bitterness and the sweet- ness there extends some five feet of space. Since relishes exist nowhere, they cannot be perceived as existing somewhere, for a phenomenalist of Hume's kind would take this perception as meaning that they do exist in some place: to appear, in this sense, is to be. The error consequently must lie in vital belief. What happens in this believing? One answer, and the most credible one, would express it by some such term as 'taking for granted'. But Hume propounds the forma- tion of a complex idea. In the idea by which we represent our per- ceptual experience-represent it erroneously-we incorporate the nonbodily qualities of bitterness and sweetness with the bodily qualities of blackness and corrugated firmness or greenness and elastic softness. In this complex idea the unextended is anomalously because impossibly ioined with the extended, and this impossible conjunction is then 'naturally' believed to be found in-in con- sequence of a 'great propensity' is projected into-the perceptual world itself. The paradoxes are Hume's. The answer to our second question is also clear. With regard 'Ibid., pp. 237 f 32</page><page sequence="14">PROJECTION to the perceptual world, 'incorporate' and 'conjoin' are wholly metaphorical; as there is nothing in that world which corresponds to them, there is no impression for them to denote. But with regard to the world of thought they are not metaphorical, that is, they designate and describe a process which actually goes on. Hume's projection results from a mistaken belief about the world. It is therefore analogous to the one alleged by the atheists under our first dialectical category, the projection resulting from the belief that human qualities or the father-image exist where and as they do not in fact exist. But there was also the projection of a god toward the God whose reality it serves to reveal. In perception, analogously, we should expect some instance of an authentic objectification of the subjective, in particular an anomalous and subjectively derived constituent of the perceptual world, a constituent no less actually there than a coloured sense-datum. Hume could easily have supplied the lack himself. In his essay 'Of the Standard of Taste' (1757) he declares that 'beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty'.' Then if the mind should spread its sentiments, as it spreads its sensations, on external objects, the result would be beauty as senti- ment objectified. I seem, moreover, through the elegant vagueness of Hume, to discern that the sentiment of beauty consists in a pleasure- feeling. But since it is at least arguable whether pleasures occupy space, whether, therefore, they, any more than the relishes of fig or olive, could really be conjoined with colour and tangibility, perhaps Hume wisely avoids the claim that mental tastes are spread on objects. His so-called 'beauties' of objects are beauties only in the metonymic sense that they cause the sentiments of beauty. The lack was supplied, and the neglected possibility of Hume made actual, in the early aesthetics of Santayana. 'The aesthetic effect of objects', according to Santayana, 'is always due to the total emotional value of the consciousness in which they exist. We merely attribute this value to the object by a projection which is the ground of the apparent objectivity of beauty.'2 Where the supremely beautiful, the sublime, is a projection onto thoughts and actions (and so an instance of a nonperceptual projection into experience), what we ordinarily call beautiful is a projection onto sensible things. The sublime really consists in an emotion, that of detachment and liberation; but 'what we objectify in beauty is a sensation', and this 'Hume, Essays Moral, Political, and Literary, ed. Green and Grose (2 vols.; London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1875), I, 268. 2George Santayana, The Sense of Beauty (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1896), pp. 234 f. 33</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY sensation is that of pleasure.' Santayana can therefore say that 'beauty is pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing'; it is pleasure become 'a quality of the object,... incorporated in the perception of things . . .2 Pleasure, projected as beauty, is thus a constituent part of the world of outer perception. But, as in all theories of projection, there is anomaly to be reckoned with. How is it possible for my pleasure, which is within me, even to appear as part of the object confronting me from without? The answer lies in that 'old doctrine of the physiologists' recalled by Santayana's friend, Strong, the doctrine 'that sense-data are brought before us by the "projection" of states of mind called "sensations" '. The object I perceive does not confront me from without but only seems to; it exists within my consciousness and confronts me from within. Every element of the perceived world is a sensation; but, says Santayana, 'every sensation we get from a thing is originally treated as one of its qualities'. Convenience and economy of thought 'lead us gradually to reduce the qualities of the object to a minimum, and to regard most perceptions as an effect of those few qualities upon us'. Nonetheless, 'the right and tendency to be objective is equal in all, since they are all prior to the artifice of thought by which we separate ... the thing from our experience'.3 It is no oddity if colour and pleasure, possessed of the same ontic status, show the same phenomenal status, too. The anomaly in Santayana is unreal. To be sure, there are pleasures and pleasures; some are projected and some are not. Most pleasures are easily distinguished from the perceived object with which they are associated; 'but when the process of perception itself is pleasant' or when it is appropriately associated with 'further processes, due to the existence of former impressions', then the pleasure becomes, like the other objectified feelings, a quality of the object, and we distinguish it from the non- projected pleasures by the name of beauty.4 But there are also colours and colours; some, in the language of the physiologists, are projected, and some are not. There are those colours which are perceived as belonging to the surface of a physical object, and there are those colours-without-a-surface which we distinguish as images in the mind. The parallel of pleasure and colour is complete. Remembering Hume's argument, one might still suggest that we only feign the association of pleasure and colour. Granted they are in the mind, really, but the curator keeps them in separate collections, colours in that of Spatial Sensations, pleasures in the Collection of 'Ibid., pp. 239 f. 2lbid., p. 49. 3Ibid., pp. 44-47. 4Ibid., pp. 48 f. and 197. 34</page><page sequence="16">PROJECTION Nonspatial Sensations. The difficulty, however, is Hume's; it is not Santayana's. Though Santayana calls beauty a quality of the object and thus identifies it with colour and shape, the identity is with respect to their subjectivity or objectivity. He need not deny other differences. He could commend the statement of Alexander, a third of a century on, that beauty is of an order distinct from that of the secondary qualities;' and we have seen him employ for beauty, as Alexander does, the term 'value'. A value is something the sculpture or the wild scene possesses in a peculiar way, namely, as a whole. There is no call, in consequence, to suppose that we feign in the object the association of a pleasure part with coloured and tangible parts: for Santayana, the difficulty presented by Hume's dialectic does not arise. IV So now we have seen and examined examples of each great type of projectionism. They need only be glanced at again in close relation. One type, with two subtypes, I term empirical. In the first sub- type, what is projected actually enters into the world as perceived -witness certain eidetic images; in the second, what is projected is merely believed, is not actually perceived, to occupy a place in the world of perception-this was illustrated by the Trobrianders' uniform and perseverant affirmation of patrilineal resemblance. I term these types empirical because empirical evidence can in principle be brought to bear on the question whether, in a possible instance, a projection does or does not occur. Under the first subtype the investigator establishes the projection of a sensory component into the world as perceived; under the second, the projection only of a belief about that world, only of the supposition of a component. In the first instance the anomaly is real; the eidetic image is perceived where it has no business being. In the second instance, not only does the resemblance not exist, it is not even perceived as existing; the anomaly is dispelled by investigation. Mostly the discussion concerned the two types of projectionism I call dialectical. Here the actuality of the alleged projection cannot be established, as it cannot be definitely rejected, by a direct examination of the world: inspection cannot assure us that the fig's flavour is or is not located in the fig. In the former type, what is given to the investigator is a believing and a belief; in the latter, what is given is the activity of perceiving and the world as perceived. But for either type the evidence relevant to an examination of what is given derives not from what is given but from convictions about the IS.

Hence it is that I call these pro- jectionisms dialectical: various investigators, in consequence of their ontological and epistemological convictions, have been brought to analyse in projective terms certain beliefs about the supersensible or certain aspects of perception. Each sort of dialectical projectionism, the intelligible and the sensible, divides into parallel subtypes. In the first subtype, certain things appear to be certain other things that in fact they are not, either because that which is predicated does not exist or because the combination of subject and predicate does not or even cannot occur. In whichever case, the things are not the things they appear initially to be and must therefore finally be said to be disguised as those things. Human qualities are disguised as an extra-human being, though a being of the sort supposed does not exist; relishes are disguised as spatial qualities, which without self-contradiction they could not be said to be, which consequently they cannot be. The anomalies are real. In the second subtype, certain things appear on initial inspection to be disguised as certain other things, but it finally proves that in fact there is no disguise, since the things really are the things they appear to be. The good projected is the un- projected God; the ontic status of all qualities is the same. In each case, there being but one thing or one sort of thing involved, the anomaly is unreal. I have not presented these possibilities to urge either an affirma- tion or a denial of any nonempirical projectionism. My aim has been to clarify what people are doing when they speak, whatever their actual words, in a projectionist way. For them, in its measure, projectionist speech allows the intelligibility of the world to show forth. But the projectionism expressed in the speech has been given what it gives. To adopt a projectionist way of speaking would only make sense, therefore, in conscious dependence on the convictions that make it meaningful, convictions which themselves require the defence of reasonable talk.
