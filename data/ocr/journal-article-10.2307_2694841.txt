This trend is seen in nearly all regions; it is particularly evident in Puerto Rico and the Neth- erlands Antilles. Throughout the Caribbean, important new research is underway using sophisticated tech- niques such as compositional analyses of lithics and ceramics, detailed floral and faunal analyses, large-area excavations, and regional archaeological survey. If archaeological research has seen some accelera- tion, however, commercial development and environ- mental deterioration in the Caribbean has seen even greater acceleration. Island by island, archaeological sites are being destroyed by uncontrolled development, sand mining, coastal erosion, and other forces. The same processes are clearly taking a toll on the ecosys- tems of the islands and of the sea as well. In recent years, therefore, Caribbean archaeologists have been joining forces and combining agendas and objectives with projects and groups promoting environmental conservation. To a growing extent Caribbean archae- ologists are coming to understand their role as archae- ological conservators, as well as researchers. On islands, perhaps with greater clarity and urgency than on the mainland, it is easy to envision the total destruction of ecosystems and the archaeological re- mains of past human inhabitants. Almost ironically, with their accelerating environmental destruction, modem societies are destroying the remaining archae- ological evidence of groups of people who previously lived in the same environments, and who caused them little ecological damage. The next decade will be critical for stemming the destruction of the Caribbean's ar- chaeological heritage. GENERAL ISSUES. Elizabeth S. Wing and Lee Ann Newsom (both of the Florida Museum of Natural History [FMNH]) are continuing their research on plant and animal remains excavated from West Indian sites. Definite trends and patterns of plant and animal use are emerging, particularly for the ceramic period. No- table among plant identifications are maize kernels and cob remains, and numerous manioc tuber fragments from the site of En Bas Saline, northern Haiti (A.D. 146</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH 147 1250-1500). Two types of maize are present: popcorn and a flour-type maize that could be ground into flour or meal. Maize occurs in prehistoric as well as Contact period contexts at En Bas Saline. R. Christopher Good- win kindly lent specimens of what had been tentatively identified as maize kernels, from the Sugar Factory Pier site, St. Kitts. However, the St. Kitts Specimens were found to be lobster or crab gastroliths. Thus the maize remains from En Bas Saline are the only confirmed reports of prehistoric maize from Caribbean contexts. Osvaldo Garcia-Goyco (Universidad Compultense de Madrid) has continued research on the lexicon and morphology of the Arawak linguistic family of South America and the West Indies, comparing the basic vo- cabulary of 81 Arawakan languages with 31 Mayan languages (using the "Swadesh" 100-word noncultural list). Research to date indicates that many words on the diagnostic vocabulary list are almost identical in some languages of both linguistic families. The resem- blances of the possible cognates, involving the inter- relation of dozens of Arawakan and Mayan languages, are suggestive of a close genetic relation between mac- ro-Arawakan and macro-Maya. Richard T. Callaghan (University of Calgary) is eval- uating the performance of indigenous watercraft from the Caribbean and surrounding mainlands. His goal is to evaluate the possibilities that direct sea crossings took place between the mainland and the Greater An- tilles in Precolumbian times. The experiments (which use computer models combining information on wind and water currents with modern data on South Amer- ican watercraft) considered the possibility of accidental discovery of the Greater Antilles both with and without the use of sails. A third experiment assumed intentional exploration from the mainland using paddled canoes. Preliminary results suggest that the Venezuela/Colom- bia region had the greatest potential for drift or inten- tional voyages to the Greater Antilles (especially from 3000 to 2000 B.C.). C. N. Dubelaar has cataloged the petroglyphs of the Lesser Antilles and has accumulated a bibliography of 2,100 references dealing with South American and Lesser Antillean petroglyphs. He is in the process of looking for a publisher for this important collection. BAHAMAS. William Keegan (FMNH) conducted excavations at the site of GT-2 on Grand Turk, in the Turks and Caicos, Bahamas. The site dates to approx- imately the thirteenth century A.D. and contained a Taino extraction station for making shell beads. Five- hundred complete and 700 partial or broken beads were recovered, 70 percent of them from one 2-x-2-m test unit. The research was carried out with the support of the Albion Foundation. GREATER ANTILLES. Jamaica. Candice L. Goucher (Portland State University) and E. Kofi Agor- sah (University of West Indies, Mona [UWI]) are con- tinuing historical and archaeological research on the range of interactions between African and European technology in the Caribbean. The project includes ex- cavation of the Reeder Foundry site, an eighteenth- century iron and brass foundry that employed 275 Af- ricans. This important industrial site at Morant Bay provided the opportunity for African metallurgists to contribute considerable skills and expertise. The ex- cavated furnace and associated artifacts demonstrate that the Atlantic Slave Trade era brought about an intermixture and transfer of African and European technology. African cultural and technological conti- nuities are of particular interest in the study. E. Kofi Agorsah (UWI) also began archaeological research at the remote maroon site of Nanny Town in the Blue Mountains of eastern Jamaica. Nanny Town was important historically as the stronghold of the Ma- roons and remains a significant enclave of Maroon culture in a part of Jamaica inaccessible by road. Agor- sah's project is concerned with all aspects of modern and historical Maroon heritage on Jamaica. Douglas V. Armstrong (Syracuse University [SU]) continued excavations of the African-Jamaican slave settlement at Seville Plantation. Dietary remains from the site are being analyzed by Elizabeth Reitz (Uni- versity of Georgia). The research is being conducted in cooperation with the Jamaica National Heritage Trust, with support from National Geographic and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. Extensive excavation has been completed at two villages, one dating from 1670 to 1760, and the other from 1760 to 1880. Compar- ative analysis of 15 house and yard areas allowed re- searchers to examine cultural transformations associ- ated with the emergence of an African-Jamaican community. Analyses of houses and yard areas indi- cates that many of the activities of daily life took place in the houseyard compounds. Yard features include cleared and prepared exterior floors for social gather- ing, hearths, animal pens, rock-lined gardens, and bur- ials. Three burials have been recovered from adjacent houses in the earlier settlement. The burials all faced east, and all were within 1 m of a house structure. Preliminary osteological analysis by Mark Fleischman (SU) indicate that all were males from around 21 to 25 years of age, and all three suffered from anemia. The next phase of research at Seville Plantation will use a magnetometer survey of the site to locate and examine burials and burial practices. Dominican Republic and Haiti. Kathleen Deagan (FMNH), Manuel Garcia Arevalo (Fundaci6n Garcia Arevalo), Jose Cruxent (Universidad Nacional Exper- imental Francisco de Miranda, Venezuela), and Chris- tian Martinez (Dominican Republic National Park Ser- vice) are conducting archaeological excavations at the site of La Isabela, Columbus's first intentional settle- ment in the Americas. Excavations to date have un- covered the central plaza area of La Isabela, revealing the stone church, storehouse, powderhouse, and the fortified house of Columbus. Cruxent's earlier work at the site has also revealed a satellite community of farm- ers and artisans, including a late fifteenth-century up- draft ceramic kiln. Excavations are currently underway in the residential area of the site to search for evidence of the 200 thatched huts that housed the European settlers. The research is intended to delineate the adap- tive strategies of both the Spaniards and the Taino Indians and to assess changes in the Spanish response to conditions in the New World. In 1988 and 1989 Marcio Veloz Maggiolo, Elpidio Ortega, and their colleagues conducted excavations in</page><page sequence="3">148 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] the earliest colonial occupations of the city of Santo Domingo (then Nueva Isabela). They located the water sources mentioned by Bartolome de Las Casas and Oviedo, and excavated in residential areas. Artifacts including nails, stone-carving tools, and indigenous ce- ramics were found in the earliest levels, as well as a substantial number of coins dating to ca. A.D. 1505. Beneath the modem church of the Rosario the remains of an earlier, smaller church were found, probably con- structed by Bartolome Col6n at the founding of the city. A pit discovered there had a depth of 8 m and a width of 2.70 m and appears to be the jail mentioned by the chroniclers (who mention a fort of wood and pounded earth). Veloz Maggiolo interprets these find- ings as an indication that the movement of the city from the east to the west bank was not a violent event, but one that took several years to accomplish. Faunal remains from 1505 and later show evidence of indig- enous animals, deep-sea fish, and remains of domes- ticated birds and European rodents. Small cannon balls, gun shot (including some made of fired clay), fishhooks made from nails, glass beads for trade with indigenous groups in the area, human burials dating from the fif- teenth to the twentieth centuries, and evidence of war- fare from several centuries were recovered. The re- searchers have established a ceramic chronology spanning from the indigenous to the historical period. Majolicas included Columbia Plain and a new type called Tipo Nueva Isabela, which is characterized by renaissance motifs, blue-on-white painting, and a paste related to specimens from the end of the sixteenth cen- tury or the first part of the seventeenth century. The final results will be published in Arqueologia: La fun- daci6n de la villa de Santo Domingo (by M. Veloz Maggiolo and E. Ortega) as part of the collection of the Comisi6n Dominicana Para la Celebraci6n del V Cen- tenario del Descubrimiento y Evangelizaci6n de Amer- ica. Fernando Morbin Laucer (Museo del Hombre Dominicano) has continued research on the physical anthropology of the indigenous inhabitants of Hispan- iola and on petroglyphs in the Dominican Republic. Puerto Rico. Luis A. Chanlatte Baik and Yvonne M. Narganes Storde (both of the Centro de Investi- gaciones Arqueol6gicas de la Universidad de Puerto Rico) have conducted excavations at the archaic site of Puerto Ferro. The site contains tools made of stone and shell, and to date excavations have revealed one fragmented human interment in a large hearth. Edwin Crespo has identified the skeleton as an approximately 40-year-old male, who was roughly 1.8 m tall. Radio- carbon dating of shell indicates a date of around 1900 B.C. The molluscan fauna included many bivalves (es- pecially Codakia orbicularis) and other shells from mangrove, coastal, and estuarine environments. Ma- rine turtles, fish, birds, and rodents were also present in smaller percentages. Chanlatte Baik is also continu- ing excavations at the Saladoid site of Sorce, Vieques. Luis Antonio Curet (Arizona State University) has continued regional archaeological survey in the Maun- abo Valley on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico. The study is examining the relation between demographic processes and the development of social complexity. With 10 percent of the region surveyed, 10 sites have been found. While analyses are still in progress, pre- liminary indications are that even though the popu- lation of the valley increased through time, it never approached carrying capacity. Future research will be directed toward refining the local chronology and pop- ulation estimates and examining prehistoric interac- tion within the valley and with other regions. Angel Rodriguez Alvarez has conducted a petro- glyph survey of most of Puerto Rico's eastern coastal plains and interior mountains and has developed a classificatory scheme based on motifs, rather than pet- roglyph locations, using a larger sample of petroglyphs (700 specimens from 35 sites). Results to date indicate that Puerto Rico's rock engravings can be classified in four major groups (and nine subgroups), including an- thromorphs, zoomorphs, geometric designs, and non- anthropomorphic, nonzoomorphic swaddled figures. Jose Rivera Melendez, in conjunction with the So- ciedad Arque6logica Guahayona, has conducted ar- chaeological research at the site of Cuevas de Binas, on the upper Mat6n River in eastern Puerto Rico. The cave contained 13 petroglyphs and a figure carved in high relief and is believed to be a Taino ceremonial center. Researchers note the similarity between the carved figure and the mythic figure Macocael, who ac- cording to Ram6n Pane's notes on Taino mythology guarded the cave of Caciba-jagua. Ceramics from the disturbed cave deposits correspond to the Chican and Elenan Ostionoid ceramic series. Peter G. Roe (Centro de Investigaciones Indigenas de Puerto Rico and the University of Delaware) ini- tiated a petroglyph-documentation project at the well- known site of Caguana in the central highlands of Puer- to Rico. Project personnel have made high-quality polyethylene tracings of the large carved boulders lin- ing Caguana's ball courts. The data will be used to construct a generative grammar of the petroglyphs of Puerto Rico, and to draw chronological inferences con- cerning stylistic change through time. The analysis of design elements has revealed structural similarities be- tween the Caguana petroglyphs and design elements of the most common form of Chicoid ceramic vessels, linking the site to the Chicoid or Chican Ostionoid period (the last Precontact ceramic period in the Great- er Antilles). The petroglyph scene represented at Ca- guana also has connections with South American my- thology, specifically with stories of the "Frog Woman Seductress" myths from the Guianas and Amazonia. This reinforces the interpretation that the Taino Ball Game tradition was of South American as opposed to mesoamerican derivation. LESSER ANTILLES. Virgin Islands. In Septem- ber, 1990, extensive remains of a large prehistoric oc- cupation were uncovered during development in interior St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The site, known as Tutu Archaeological Village, contains abun- dant evidence of structures, features, burials, and 1,400 postholes. Ceramics are related to both the Saladoid and later Ostionoid series. Elizabeth Righter (State Ar- chaeologist for the U.S. Virgin Islands) directed rescue excavations and data recovery on the site, employing the help of many individuals and institutions, includ- ing archaeologists at the Southeast Regional Office of</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH 149 the National Park Service and the Southeast Archeo- logical Center, Emily Lundberg, Mary Sandford, Clark Larson, and more than 200 other archaeologists and volunteers. With excavations temporarily halted, about 20 percent of the site has been exposed, and 26 m2 of midden have been excavated. Thirty burials have been excavated. Two radiocarbon dates from house posts provided dates of 730 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-42277) and 810 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-43437, both uncorrected). Ceramic correlations suggest that earlier dates will be obtained when samples from the stratified middens are sub- mitted for dating. Saba. Corinne Hofman and Menno Hoogland (University of Leiden [UL]) conducted excavations on the Precontact components of the Kelbey's Ridge and Spring Bay sites. Both assemblages contained small percentages of pottery of the Chican Ostionoid sub- series. Radiocarbon dates of the remains confirm a late fourteenth-century date for Kelbey's Ridge and an ear- ly fifteenth-century date for Spring Bay. Isotopic frac- tionation of human skeletal material was conducted by G. I. van Klinken (Oxford University) and revealed a reef component in the diet of 37 percent for the Kel- bey's Ridge burial and of 26 percent for the Spring Bay burial. Technological analyses of 700 sherds from sev- en sites on Saba are currently underway in Holland. Nevis. Samuel Wilson (University of Texas, Aus- tin [UT]), Starr Farr (University of Michigan), Andrew Manning (UT), and J. Daniel Rogers (Smithsonian In- stitution) conducted excavations at the site of Sulphur Ghaut, on the southwest coast ofNevis. Sulphur Ghaut is a post-Saladoid site dating to approximately A.D. 1000, based on ceramic correlations. In 1989 Hurn- cane Hugo destroyed approximately one-third of the site, exposing a detailed 80-m profile, and the remain- der is threatened. Excavations were carried out with the assistance of David Robinson, Vincent Hubbard, and the Nevis Historical and Conservation Society. Montserrat. Archaeological testing at the Trants site (MS-G1) was undertaken in 1990 by David Waters (Carnegie Museum of Natural History [CMNH]) and James Petersen (University of Maine, Farming- ton [UM]), under the sponsorship of the Montserrat National Trust. The recent testing at the Trants site included a combination of systematic surface collec- tion and test pit/unit excavation. The site covers ap- proximately .6 kM2, and dates from ca. 480 B.C. to A.D. 330, based on the following recent radiocarbon dates (uncorrected): 480 B.C. ? 80 (Beta-44828); 440 B.C. ? 90 (Beta-41682); 190 B.C. ? 80 (Beta-18489); 10 B.C. ? 90 (Beta-41680); A.D. 60 ? 70 (Beta-41678); A.D. 200 ? 80 (Beta-41679); A.D. 210 ? 90 (Beta- 41681); and A.D. 330 (Beta-18582). Theiranalyses are directed toward understanding early ceramic-period migrations and social interactions in the region. Robert Bartone and John Crock (UM) have com- pleted an attribute analysis of flaked-stone industries from the Trants site on Montserrat. The Trants site has yielded a substantial sample of early and middle Saladoid period lithic remains (n = 2,460 to date). Their analysis has provided evidence concerning the lithic reduction sequence and of a parallel and more complex process of lithic ornament manufacture. All of the stone came from areas outside of Montserrat; most from Antigua, but possibly some came from as far away as mainland South America. Antigua. A technological analysis of pottery is be- ing undertaken by David Watters (CMNH), Desmond Nicholson (Museum of Antigua and Barbuda), Martin T. Fuess (University of Pittsburgh [UP]), Jack Donahue (UP), and James Petersen (UM). Their research in- volves petrographic thin-section analysis of ceramic samples from several islands in the northern Lesser Antilles, including Barbuda, Antigua, and Montserrat. A collection of 97 prehistoric thin-sectioned ceramic sherds representing 21 sites and three geological sub- divisions on Antigua is also under analysis. The re- searchers are also examining historic Afro-Caribbean ceramics. Ceramic attribute analysis to date has dem- onstrated island-specific and interregional ceramic traditions. Some technological attributes are shared be- tween distinctive ceramic traditions, primarily in terms of temper, raw materials, and certain aspects of hand- built technology. Significant evidence of interisland transport and/or exchange is also documented in some of the prehistoric samples. The Museum of Antigua and Barbuda is sponsoring a project of excavation and reconstruction at an early sugar-processing windmill at Betty's Hope. The project is under the direction of Conrad Goodwin (Northern Illinois University). Betty's Hope was Antigua's pio- neer sugar planation in the 1670s, where large-scale sugar cultivation and innovative methods of sugar pro- cessing were introduced. Martinique. F. Rodriquez-Loubet (Direction des Antiquites Prehistoriques et Historiques de la Marti- nique [DAPHM]) has made a reconnaissance and in- ventory of sites on Martinique, using satellite imagery and field research. Nathalie Vidal has analyzed ma- terial from the site of Diamant, dating to approxi- mately the third or fourth century A.D. Archaeological evidence associated with these first agricultural pop- ulations shows a Venezuelan Saladoid ancestry, with some Barrancoid features present. On this evidence, however, the researchers feel the populations exhibit only a very distant relationship to those of mainland, and that it is no longer appropriate to consider them in reference to the Orinoco delta (e.g., using terms like "modified" or "insular" Saladoid). Research is continuing under the direction of Serge Veuve (DAPHM) at the site of the town of Saint-Pierre de la Martinique, which was destroyed by the eruption of Mont Pel6 in 1902. Colette Leton and Jean-Baptiste Barret (DAPHM) are conducting historical-archaeological research at the sugar plantations of Creve-Coeur and Fond Saint- Jaques. Their studies concern changes in the technol- ogy of sugar production and environmental change on Martinique. NORTHEAST SOUTH AMERICA AND COAST- AL ISLANDS. French Guiana. The Centre OR- STOM (Institut Francais de Recherche Scientifique pour le Developpement en Cooperation) of French Guiana has been carrying out research on several lines, under the direction of Stephan Rostain. The projects include a technological study of prehistoric lithic utilization, which has involved constructing typologies and inves-</page><page sequence="5">150 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] tigating reduction sequences. The Centre also con- ducted a survey of sites recorded on eighteenth-century maps of the Approuague River and examined prehis- toric occupations in the hills of Ouanary. Project "Sa- vanes," conducted in collaboration with Pierre Frenay (Institut Geographique National) and Jean Huralt, in- volved a survey of the land between Cayenne and the Marone River. The research showed that French Gui- ana was densely populated in prehistoric times. Philippe Nowacki-Breczewski and Oliver Puaux (DAPHM) are conducting archaeological research as- sociated with the construction of a hydroelectric dam at Petit Saut. The sites they have located date to ap- proximately A.D. 800-1100. Similarities with ceram- ics of the Koriabo style are evident. Hugues Petitjean-Roget has conducted archaeolog- ical research in the Bruyere mountains in the Bay of Oyapock. A rockshelter there contained undisturbed Amerindian mortuary goods, along with Delft pottery, suggesting an early Contact period date for the site. The Bay of Oyapock was an important rendezvous for European travelers from the sixteenth century on, in- cluding Walter Raleigh, Robert Harcourt, Jesse de For- est, and Henry Fonston. The conjoint use of the oral history of the Palikur, the writings of early European visitors, and the archaeological remains should pro- vide important data on the early period of European contact in the region. Aruba. A. H. Versteeg (UL) and a team from his university and the Archaeological Museum of Aruba are continuing research at the late preceramic cemetary at Malmok (ca. A.D. 300). Curaqao. In May, 1991, a three-year project fo- cusing on the archaeology of African peoples on Cu- raacao was begun by Jay Haviser of the Archaeological- Anthropological Institute of the Netherlands Antilles. The project includes extensive archival research in Eu- rope conducted by Nadia Simmons-Brito, archaeolog- ical research and museum analysis by Haviser, and excavation campaigns on Curacao. Zuurzak, a seven- teenth-century slave camp, will be the principal focus of the archaeological research, augmented by excava- tions at eighteenth- and nineteenth-century slave/free- man houses in rural and urban settings on Curacao. The varying adaptive strategies of people of African ancestry will be examined by looking at urban and rural settlements in both early and late Colonial periods on Curacao. Samuel M. Wilson THE AMAZON, EASTERN BRAZIL, AND THE ORINOCO BOLIVIA. Llanos de Mojos. Clark L. Erickson (University of Pennsylvania) and Jose Esteves (Insti- tuto Nacional de Arqueologia) conducted fieldwork on Prehispanic raised fields, causeways, and canals in the Llanos de Mojos of eastern lowland Bolivia during July, 1990. A number of large previously unreported raised-field complexes were documented during aerial and ground survey. Excavations were made in raised fields and causeways at the El Villar site located in the savanna between San Ignacio and San Borja. Original field morphology and various stages of construction were determined through trenching operations. Ceram- ics, charcoal, pollen, and opal-phytolith remains were recovered from the construction fill of field platforms and canals and from buried occupation floors below the agricultural features. A series of five radiocarbon dates from these features indicate the construction and use of the agricultural features is chronologically brack- eted between ca. 2070 and 800 B.P. Causeway net- works, integrated into raised-field complexes, were also investigated, and these features suggest a sophisticated knowledge of hydraulic engineering by the raised-field farmers. The density of occupation mounds associated with these engineering works is impressive, indicating a large Prehispanic population in this tropical context. In addition, the excavated features were used as a mod- el to construct .5 ha of experimental raised fields as part of an applied archaeology program in collabora- tion with the Universidad T6cnica del Beni and the Biological Station of the Beni. BRAZIL. Mato Grosso do Sul. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz (Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas) reports that a team of researchers from the Instituto Anchie- tano de Pesquisas, Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul and the Universidade do Vale do Rio completed a survey of a tropical savannah area of plan- alto. Three small rockshelter sites contained sparse re- mains of transient hunters and gatherers of the early, middle, and late Holocene. Little ceramic material or other evidence of horticultural peoples was found. Nu- merous monochrome pictographs and petroglyphs were found in protected areas. Designs consisted of simple arrangements of small grooves. The most ancient de- signs are geometric, while more recent ones consist of stylized biomorphic forms. The cultural material re- sembles contemporary material found 100 km away in southeast Goias (Serran6polis region). The Mato Grosso sites are much less dense, not so stable, and show none of the nucleation characteristic of the 43 shelter sites studied in Serran6polis. Two more vol- umes dealing with the Serran6polis sites (one dealing with the rock art and the other with stone artifacts) should be available soon. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz reports that since 1990 the same team of investigators has been carrying out sur- vey work in the Pantanal near the city of Corumba on the frontier with Bolivia. The pilot survey area (a 100- x-50-km section) contains three environmental zones (an inundated zone, grasslands, and a transitional zone with high forested hills). It is hoped that the research will provide a better understanding of the meeting and interaction of the Chaco and Amazonian cultures. Ini- tial research has revealed numerous mounds and many deep sites. Preceramic material has been found but the majority of sites pertain to ceramic-using peoples. Pe- dro Ignacio Schmitz believes that the majority of the ceramic material relates to Chaco people, while the higher natural platforms may have been occupied by the Guarani, known in colonial times as the Itatim. It is suggested that the Chaco people were controlled from these higher locations. No radiocarbon dates are avail- able at present, but it is not unlikely that a long se-</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH 151 quence of diverse cultural material will be found, and some cultural similarity to the Mojos of Bolivia will be seen. Many petroglyphs similar to ones found along the banks of the Araguaia and Tocantin rivers are found at the base of the natural rock platforms. The Ama- zonian component of the Pantanal probably made its entrance along these two rivers. The first stage of re- search in this area is to continue for the next four years. Mato Grosso. Irmhild Wiust (Universidade Federal de Goias) reports on the results of ethnoarchaeological and archaeological work in the Rio Sao Lourenco Ba- sin. Work has been carried out with the collaboration of Ranate B. Viertler (Universidade de Sao Paulo), and it has been financed by Fundacao de Amparo Pes- quisa do Estado de Sao Paulo and the Conselho Na- cional de Desenvolvimento e Technol6gico. Research results have been submitted to the Universidade de Sao Paulo as Wiust's doctoral thesis Continuidade e Mundan,a, para uma interpretacdo dos grupos cer- amistas pre-coloniais da Bacta do Rio Vermelho, MT. An analysis of materials from 100 sites ranging between 2550 B.P. and the twentieth century has allowed Wust to propose the following developmental scenario for the ethnographically known Bororo. People of the Uru ceramic tradition were in the Rio Vermelho area by 2750 B.P. They built circular villages similar to ones known from the ethnographic record with diameters ranging from 110 to 380 m. Sites consist of one to three concentric rings of habitation units. Evidence indicates that people of the Uru tradition carried out regular trade with carriers ofthe Tupiguarani tradition. Through time the Uru people are believed to have sought the richer soils found along the Rio Vermelho where they came into intimate contact with the Tupiguarani. The shift to the river environemnts may have been stim- ulated by the increasing importance of maize and the need for richer soils to grow it. By the beginning of the eighteenth century an integration of Tupiguarani and Uru components is evidenced at site MT-RN- 11. This combining of Tupiguarani and Uru cultural elements evolved into the ethnographically known Bororo. Mythological and archaeological data support this hy- pothesis and it is hoped that physical-anthropological data and linguistic analysis can substantiate the theory. Unlike the ethnographically known Bororo, these early Bororo lived in linear settlements that extended along the river banks. Circular Bororo villages may be a man- ifestation of their being pushed from the river areas to less fertile interfluvial lands in colonial times. Wiist also provides further results on the Serra dos Coroados Project. Site (MT-SL-7 1), the Abrigo do Cas- telo, has been dated by the following radiocarbon dates: The 20-25-cm level that pertains to the Uru ceramic tradition has been dated to 1130 ? 60 B.P. (Beta- 31035). The 63-67-cm level dates to 1990 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-31036), and the 102-106-cm level dates to 5750 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-31307). The two older dates pertain to deposits containing stone tools made by heavy per- cussion with secondary soft-percussion flaking. No ce- ramic evidence is associated with the older material. An abundance of red pigment like that used to make the pictographs was found at the 60-70-cm level. This suggests that the pictographs relate largely to the pre- ceramic periods. Survey work was planned for July and August, 1991, mn the middle course of the Sao Lourenco River near the Reserva Indigena Gomes Carneiro, with special attention to be directed toward gaining a better un- Ierstanding the transition to ceramic use and the re- Lation of the painted and engraved rock-art styles. Re- search time also was devoted to the study of ethnographically known Bororo sites in the area. Rio Grande do Sul. Jose Proenza Brochado (Univ- ersidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul) announced that the seventh symposium on Rio Grande do Sul archaeology is scheduled to be held in the city of Ta- quara in 1992. The Museu Arqueol6gico do Rio Gran- de do Sul will host the meetings as part of the cele- bration to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Brochado has proposed reconsidering the standard re- construction of successive cultures in the region. He notes that the radiocarbon dates for the area suggest a good deal of overlap and probable contemporaneity. He also calls for a synthesis ofthe known archaeological record of southern Brazil. These subjects will certainly be on the agenda of the 1992 symposium in Taquara. ECUADOR. Ecuadorian Amazonia. In August a program of salvage archaeology was begun under the direction of P. J. Netherly (University of Massachu- setts-Amherst). Survey and limited testing have been carried out at six exploratory oil-well locations. A total of 14 prehistoric sites was found at four of these. Drilling locations visited are on the tops of ridges between the Curaray and Conambo rivers at an altitude of 650-350 m. The ridges rise some 100-150 m above the streams of the well-developed flood plains. Their flat tops and frequently stepped sides appear to have been attractive for human settlement and shifting cul- tivation. Prehistoric occupation was not found on all the ridge- top locations tested, but where it was present, radio- carbon assays indicated repeated occupation through time. The most significant finding was a series of open- air kilns at the Canta 2 site just north of the Conambo River. Here, repeated firing events left a stratigraphic column of great reliability. The earliest (uncorrected) date obtained was 1380 ? 90 B.P. (Beta-44265). A more recent date of 890 ? 90 B.P. (Beta-44263) was associated with an arc of large sherds found at the edge of a kiln pit. The pottery associated with the second date has many features in common with the plain wares of the Napo phase described by Evans and Meggers. The most recent date for open-kiln firing at this site was 390 ? 100 B.P. (Beta-44262). Burial mounds were located and excavated at two sites. In addition, at one of these sites (Moretecocha) a series of whole and incomplete vessels had been de- liberately cached in the subsoil, apparently under the floor of a house. These were uncovered as bulldozers began clearing for the construction of a rig platform. Since these vessels lack archaeological context, they must be cross-dated by stylistic comparisons (it is pos- sible that a date of 670 ? 140 A.D. [Beta-44269] may date this occupation). However, an early domestic oc- cupation in the vicinity of the cached vessels is dated to 1100 ? 160 B.P. (Beta-44267). T'hese preliminary results indicate that this area was</page><page sequence="7">152 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] occupied by 1350 B.P. and probably continually there- after. Petroleum exploration has made it possible to initiate research in an area that is now only accessible by helicopter. The relation of these inland communities to those established on the major navigable rivers re- mains to be established. VENEZUELA. Bolivar. The research project "Arqueologia y Espeleologia Hist6rica de la Regi6n de Impacto del Complejo Los Piliguaos, Edo. Bolivar," directed by Kay Tarble (Universidad Central de Ven- ezuela [UCV]), has continued survey and preliminary excavations in the Barraguan region. Financial support of the Bauxita de Venezuela Compafiia An6nima (BAUXIVEN) under the auspices of the Convenio Ministerio del Ambiente y Recursos No Renovables/ BAUXIVEN has made the research possible. To date, 17 habitation sites, one possible lithic workshop, and 3 sites with rock paintings have been located. In the vicinity of several of the habitation sites, rockshelters have been found associated with scattered ceramic sherds, lithic remains, petroglyphs or rock paintings, and in one case, the remains of a human burial. Re- mains associated with the sites pertain to different ce- ramic series defined for the area. In the sites located on high ground near the Orinoco River, Saladoid and Cedenoid materials characterize the earliest occupa- tions. Arauquinoid ceramics dominate in the later (950- 5 50 B.P.) strata of these sites, associated with a smaller proportion of Valloid materials. Sites range between 3 and 6 ha in size. Further inland, the sites are smaller (ca. 2 ha) and more disperse. Valloid ceramics are dom- inant and are associated with numerous lithic materials including polished axes, flaked artifacts of varying di- mensions, quartz point fragments, and manos and me- tates. Ant. Javier Femrnndez and Ant. Isabel Pinia (UCV) carried out a systematic surface survey, shovel testing, and test excavations at Juan Castillo, an inland site of this type. They recovered 66 large fragments of metates on the surface of the site and in the excavations they were able to discriminate areas with hearths and other areas of refuse disposal. Valloid ceramics were over- whelmingly predominant, with a minimal proportion of Arauquinoid materials. A thermoluminescence date of 790 B.P. confirmed the late occupation of this shal- low site (all remains were found between 0 and 30 cm). Although flotation and phytolith analyses were at- tempted, preservation of the botanical remains was extremely poor. Until further analysis is carried out, it can only be suggested that the metates and manos on the site were used in maize processing. It is interesting to note that none of the riverine sites in the survey area are associated with metates, a fact that suggests varied subsistence strategies for the different contexts. It is possible that the inland sites may have been uti- lized mainly during the rainy season. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of freshwater sources near these sites at the height of the dry season. A complete report of these excavations, the analysis of archaeological ma- terials, and a summary of evidence found in the chron- icles as to resource exploitations in the region are to be found in the Trabajo Final de Grado by Isabel Piiio, Juan Castille: Un sitfo de habitaci6n Valloid en el Ori- noco medio (1990). The results of the archaeological surveys are summarized in the annual reports sub- mitted to BAUXIVEN. Future work in the area, financed by a grant from the Consejo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Humanistico of the Universidad Central, will concentrate on the excavation of the riverine site of La Urbana. A prelim- inary survey of the site carried out in February 1991 revealed extensive remains underlying the present town of La Urbana. Materials found correspond to Saladoid, Arauquinoid, Valloid, and colonial occupations. This town served as a mission site in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is hoped that excavation will reveal evidence on change related to the impact of European contact on the indigenous settlement pattern, demography, and subsistence strategies. In the Parguaza River area, Franz Scaramelli (UCV) has continued the speleo-historical survey begun by Miguel Angel Perera (UCV) in caves containing mag- nificent rock paintings, Prehispanic ceramic remains, and burials pertaining to ethnic groups present in the area today, the Piaroa (W6thuha) and Mapoyo (Wanai). A detailed review of their myths, rites regarding rock art, and the use of caves is hoped to clarify the contexts, use, and meanings assigned to different elements of their art. This research may serve to support inferences as to past use of caves and the significance of rock art. BAUXIVEN also financed survey and preliminary excavations at Puerto Cedeiio, a habitation site on the bank of the Orinoco River. The site is associated with a large group of petroglyphs found on rocks lying in the river to the north of the site. In February, 1990, Pedro Rivas, Josefina Casella, and Gladys Gordones participated in the survey of the site and Rodrigo Na- varrete directed excavations. Preliminary analyses of the remains revealed a ceramic sequence with several occupations. The lowermost strata is associated exclu- sively with Cedefioid ceramics. Saladoid and Arau- quinoid materials appear in the succeeding layers. A detailed stylistic sequence of the ceramic materials is in preparation. Pedro Rivas prepared a report on the petroglyphs, which included scaled drawings of more than 60 motifs. He has also made comparisons with glyphs found in adjacent areas and decorative elements found on ceramics at related sites. Ethnohistoric ref- erences as to the composition of the indigenous pop- ulation at the time of contact is being studied, and references to rock art in the oral traditions of both criollo and indigenous populations are being collected. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA There has been an increase in the intensity and char- acter of looting along Peru's north coast. The changes are partially the result of the publicity concerning the rich tombs at Sipan, as well as the continuing economic crisis in Peru. The linkage between Sipan and the recent looting is most evident in the way in which the sites are being pillaged. Massive pits 6-15 m in depth have been dug through the rooms and floors of monumental architecture in search of elite burials at sites like Mo- collope and Naranjal in Chicama, and Serraque in Viru.</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH 153 Prior to the Sipan discovery, modem looting had fo- cused on discrete cemetery areas or intrusive inter- ments, rather than on public constructions. On September 25, 1990, Father Pedro Porras Garces died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 75. Porras was a pioneer in Ecuadorian prehistory. He founded and directed the Center of Archaeological Investiga- tions at the Universidad Cat6lica in Quito. Over the last forty years, Porras had carried out studies along the coast, highlands, and eastern lowlands of Ecuador, and was the author of over a dozen monographs and general volumes on Ecuadorian archaeology. VENEZUELA. The imminent construction of a large water reservoir in Yacambui (Portuguesa, Western Venezuela) and the laying out of a vast network of irrigation canals throughout the Quibor Valley threat- ens the integrity of important archaeological sites. A five-year salvage program of surveys and excavations was initiated early in 1990 under the direction of Lil- liam Arvelo (Investigaciones Venezolano de Investi- gaciones Cientificas [IVIC] and University of Pitts- burgh [UP]). This region of western Venezuela contains two of the tnost important ceramic traditions in Ven- ezuela. The Tocuyanoid tradition, with its curvilinear polychrome designs, represents the earliest-known peoples with pottery to intrude into the region (ca. 800 B.C.-A.D. 300) and relates to the so-called First Paint- ed Horizon of Colombia. This tradition was eventually replaced by the Tierroid tradition (A.D. 100-1500) that is characterized by geometric-angular polychrome painted designs and appears to be stylistically related to several late polychrome painted traditions of Co- lombia and Venezuela. In addition, the valley includes what was regarded as an isolated and chronologically intermediate ceramic complex identified as "Boule- vard phase" (ca. A.D. 300). In addition to the man- dated mitigation, the Yacambiu Project is designed to address a broad range of problems, the most important of which are (1) to establish a reliable across-valley chronological sequence and (2) to determine the nature and complexity of the Prehispanic sociopolitical or- ganization. Phase 1 of the Yacambui Project, consisting of tran- sect surveys within the mountainous area of the pro- jected Yacambui Dam zone, has been completed. The survey revealed no Precontact sites; only two small historical-period sites were found. The excavations of both sites revealed traditional criollo pottery associ- ated with wattle-and-daub house structures. Phase II has just begun and involves transect surveys within the valley of Quibor. Both Tocuyanoid and Tierroid sites are abundant throughout the valley, attesting to a long history of high population density. Tierroid settle- ments are extensive, and in the Los Dos Puertas-Bo- tiquin area, the largest is 9 km in extent. The Tierroid sites include horseshoe-shaped mounds and/or nu- merous rounded-conical midden deposits. Tocuyanoid sites have also been identified, some underlying 1 m of sterile colluvium and others overlain by Tierroid deposits. The most important preliminary finding is that the so-called "Boulevard phase" ceramic style (ca. A.D. 300) appears to be a development from the earlier Tocuyano complex (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 300) and is the stylistic and chronological antecedent of the San Pablo complex (ca. A.D. 1000) in the Yaracuy Valley, to the east of Quibor-Barquisimeto. If this is confirmed, it would require modification of J. R. Oliver's hypothesis of two separate population movements into the region from the Venezuelan Llanos. The new data strongly suggest that only one major population movement (Macro-Tocuyanoid) occurred and that it locally di- verged into various branches. Under the direction of Jacqueline Clarac of the Mu- seo Arqueol6gico of the Universidad de los Andes, the program of surveys and test excavations of Prehispanic agricultural terraces continues in the La Pedregosa area, state of Merida. Thus far, preliminary results obtained by archaeologists Elvira Ramos and Andres Puig sug- gest a predominant association of the Miquimui ceram- ic style (ca. A.D. 1000) with the terraces. In the high Venezuelan Andes, also around the city of Merida, Antonio Niiio is surveying deep-shaft tomb sites known as mintoyes, of which only a handful have been sci- entifically excavated to date. A large-scale mitigation project is planned at the site of Lagunillas, east of Lake Maracaibo. Alberta Zucchi (IVIC) is currently starting a new project in the state of Falc6n, which focuses on the historical archaeology of the Black (slave descendants) and Amerindian (mostly Jirajara) settlers in the Sierra de San Luis. The study focuses on the processes of change, acculturation, and adaptation between the Blacks and native Indians of Falc6n during the early European Contact and Colonial periods. Kay Tarble (Universidad Central de Venezuela) has just begun to direct the first phase of a long-term re- search program in the little-known area of the Los Pijigiiaos, southeast of Ciudad Bolivar, in the Vene- zuelan Guayana Shield area. The focus of the inves- tigations is on settlement patterns and space utilization relying on both archaeological (predominantly Valloid series) and ethnological data (Panare and Piaroa In- dians). Jose R. Oliver (Yale University [YU]) and the late C. S. Alexander (University of Illinois [UI]) have con- cluded a geomorphological and geochronological re- search of the stream terraces in the middle Pedregal Valley. The research focused on testing the validity of J. M. Cruxent's four-stage sequence of Paleoindian complexes (Joboid series) on the basis of terrace for- mations. Their work demonstrates that despite signif- icant local tectonic deformations, stream terraces can be dated and related to local Paleoindian assemblages of the El Jobo (Joboid) series. Soil analyses, absolute dates, and other stratigraphic evidence relating to the association between artifact assemblages and flood- plain-terrace formations were studied. Oliver and Al- exander also reported finding rare Madden Lake-type fluted projectile points and a variety of fishtail points in the Peninsula of Paraguana. This is the first evidence of the presence of Clovisoid (or non-Joboid) projectiles in Western Venezuela. In the state of Lara, Arturo Jaimes Queros (Museo Arqueol6gico de Quibor) conducted excavations in re- cently discovered Paleoindian sites belonging to the Joboid series. Subsequent analysis focused on the spa- tial distribution of the Los Tres Cruces assemblages,</page><page sequence="9">154 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] characterized by El Jobo type projectile points. A new kill site with the remains of Megatherium sp. and Jo- boid lithic tools in the Barbacoas Range (Lara) is cur- rently being excavated by Jaimes Queros and associ- ates. In addition, Jaimes Queros continues his survey of Paleoindian sites in the Baragua-Barbacoas high- lands. It is expected that Paleoindian Joboid sites form a continuous distribution between the Pedregal Basin and the Baragua-Barbacoas areas. COLOMBIA. The Proyecto Arqueol6gico Valle de la Plata, coordinated by Robert D. Drennan (UP) and Carlos A. Uribe (Universidad de los Andes [UA]), has completed systematic regional settlement pattem sur- vey of some 600 km2 in a part of Colombia's Alto Magdalena region. Small-scale stratigraphic excava- tions have provided information for a regional ceramic chronology of somewhat greater precision than that previously in use for the Alto Magdalena. Analysis of settlement distribution, concentrating particularly on relating settlement to agricultural resources, is nearing completion. Results of studies of modem vegetation and the modem and ancient pollen record of the pro- ject's study area have been published recently. Current project fieldwork focuses on larger-scale ex- cavation of sites selected on the basis of the pattems emerging from analysis of the settlement-distribution data. These sites are chosen for their potential to con- tribute to more detailed reconstruction of social, po- litical, and economic organization in various segments of the 2,500-year sequence of chiefdoms in the region. In 1990-1991 Jeffrey Blick (UP) and Camilo Diaz (UA) excavated residential areas dating to the Regional Clas- sic and Recent periods in one of the settlement con- centrations identified by the regional survey. Plans for excavations during 1992 focus on residential zones of the earliest and latest parts of the Formative with pro- jects conducted by Gonzalo Jaramillo and Dale Quat- trin (UP). Fieldwork was carried out by David M. Stemper (Museo Arqueol6gico la Merced, Instituto Vallecau- cano de Investigaciones Cientificas [INCIVA], and Universidad del Valle, Cali), and Hector Salgado (IN- CIVA) on the Pacific coast of Colombia. Expanding upon a 1990 survey, portions of Prehispanic and early colonial habitation areas were excavated during Jan- uary and February 1991 in the Ordoniez (Calima River), Palestina (San Juan River), Bocana (Buenaventura Bay), and Pepita (Dagua) localities. The survey and exca- vation results will be used to assess (1) temporal as- sociation of habitation areas, plant-processing equip- ment, and maize pollen and phytoliths; and (2) the possible correlation of increased site size and popula- tion density with a greater dependence on maize (200 B.C.-A.D. 1000). The habitation area at Ordofiez covered about . 11 ha, and the deposits had a depth of 35 cm. The site was dated to the late Prehispanic period (A.D. 500- 1000 to the Spanish Conquest) based on recovered pottery similar to materials from the San Luis site and the Calima archaeological zone. Excavations during two field seasons consisted of 35 shovel tests and eight 1-iM2 units. Axes, grinding stones, stone chips possibly from graters, several reconstructible pottery vessels as- sociated baked clay, and post molds were encountered. The diameter and abundance of post molds suggest that the Prehispanic structures were pile dwellings, with frequent replacement of posts or relocation of struc- tures. One feature, a concentration of baked clay, could be the remains of a Prehispanic oven located below one of the pile dwellings. Portions of three sites were excavated in the San Juan River drainage at the locality of Palestina. Twelve shovel tests, three -iM2 units, and a 1 -x-3-m trench were ex- cavated in Palestina I, a .2-ha late Prehispanic/early Colonial period site (site depth of 1 m). Investigators identified a midden with sherds similar to the Murillo and Minguimalo styles; a 60-cm-long block made of pebbles, which was possibly related to late Prehispanic ceremonial life; and late formative Catanguero-style pottery. An incised Prehispanic pipe was also collected along the river. Excavations of 14 shovel tests and two 1-iM2 units in Palestina II permitted Stemper to deter- mine that this settlement covered about 200-300 m in length by 20-30 m in width (deposit depth 40 cm), following a linear pattern parallel to the edges of the Calima and San Juan rivers with no habitation area between them. A 30-m-tall hill beside the San Juan River, referred to as Palestina III, was covered by a probable late Prehispanic midden of 600-700 m2 (de- posit depth 50 cm). The excavation of 6 shovel tests and two -iM2 units revealed numerous pieces of car- bonized maize, probably of the Chococito race, and a 35-cm-thick A soil horizon. Several Tumaco-Tolita (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 300) sites were identified in the Buenaventura Bay area. Excavations at Bocana in- volved 15 shovel tests, four -iM2 units, and the clean- ing of 140 m of ditch profiles at a .4-ha habitation area (site depth 40-110 cm). Activity areas were identified based on grinding stones, concentrations of reconstruc- tible vessels, sections of at least five different figurines and one figurine mold, and post molds. One partially exposed occupation floor included a garbage pit. The fourth locality investigated was near the juncture of the Pepitas and Dagua rivers at about 1,500 m asl along the forested slopes of the Western Cordillera. Pepitas was surveyed to collect information about a cobblestone road built during 1845-1866 and about its relation to a nearby probable colonial and, perhaps, late Prehispanic road. Looters have pillaged dozens of shaft-and-chamber tombs in Pepitas, One of these in- cluded a stirrup dating to the Colonial period. Exca- vations along the road documented a midden with sherds dating from the late Prehispanic (Sonsoide), ear- ly and late Colonial, and the Republican periods. ECUADOR. J. A. Wolford (UP) has been con- ducting a study of the lithic industries in the Jama River valley, north-coastal Ecuador. Jama assemblages include the typical north Andean combination of ground-stone axes with utilized flakes, and an unex- pected industry of prismatic obsidian blades. Wol- ford's work establishes a foundation with a technolog- ical analysis of the blade and utilized flake industries. Stone-tool dynamics are being investigated as elements of group techno-economic strategy. Laurie Zimmerman and Vaughn M. Bryant, Jr. (Tex- as A&amp;M University) report that pollen cores were ex-</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH 155 tracted using a Livingstone Corer from two areas of swamp in the northem part of the Manabi Province of Ecuador. Pollen recovery from these cores, and from the soils of archaeological site in the nearby Jama River valley are meager. Pollen destruction caused by a host of factors including soil chemistry, mechanical deg- radation, microbes, and humans has resulted in an incomplete paleoenvironmental record. The Proyecto Arqueol6gico Tahuin of the Museo Antropol6gico del Banco Central del Ecuador (MABC) directed by Patricia Netherly (University of Massa- chusetts-Amherst [UMASS]) focused on the lower Ar- enillas Valley during the 1989 and 1990 field seasons. Survey of the lower valley and the mangrove littoral was completed, and excavations were carried out at the Zapanal site. This site consists of four low earth mounds of ap- parent nonresidential function linked in a horseshoe configuration by a series of low earthen platforms on which wattle-and-daub residential structures were erected. Most remarkable about the Zapanal site, which lies on slightly higher ground above an abandoned channel of the Arenillas River, is the presence of sev- eral distinct ceramic assemblages dating from the end of the Formative and the beginning of the Regional Development period. The present working hypothesis is that the Arenillas Valley was a border zone in which two major ceramic traditions were present. This area may have received other outside influences and, per- haps, populations from time to time. The environmental aspects of the project have been greatly advanced by K. E. Clark, who is currently en- gaged in the reconstruction of the prehistoric fisheries. Her work indicates that there was considerable vari- ability through time in the use of marine resources and that a gradient resource exploitation exists involving distance from the mangrove coast and brackish chan- nels, where the most intensively used species are found. Her work confirms that significant sites are often found on the border between important resource zones: in this case agricultural land, dry forest hunting areas, and the mangrove littoral. Karen Stothert (Trinity University), Kathleen Ep- stein (University of Texas, Austin [UT]), Thomas Cummins (Virginia Commonwealth), and Maritza Freire (MABC) have analyzed textile impressions in figurines found in museum collections. This study de- termined that Chorrera figurine-making technology continued in the Guangala, Bahia, and Jama-Coaque styles. The textiles indicated great complexity and spe- cialization in the organization of craft production in Jama-Coaque society. Stothert is preparing final reports on excavations at several sites in coastal Ecuador. One is a segment of Valdivia midden underlying the modem town of La Libertad, which provided the opportunity to study sub- sistence at that location. This midden also contained several Engoroy burials that will also be described in regional context. Another is a small Guangala site dated 1830 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-41482), which had residential refuse and debris from the manufacture of rectangular manos. Stothert is also analyzing materials from ex- cavations at a historical-period site where tar boiling was carried out using large earthenware jars mounted on adobe furnaces, and at several small homesteads occupied during the late eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries, which contained local lead-glazed earthenwares, imported glazed earthenwares, and re- fined earthenwares from England. During July and August 1990, Karen Bruhns (San Francisco State University) and James Burton (Lab- oratory for Archaeological Chemistry, University of Wisconsin [UW]) conducted a geological survey in the southern highlands of Ecuador as part of the ongoing Proyecto Pirincay-Paute. The rock-crystal source uti- lized for making crystal beads by the inhabitants of the late Formative site of Pirincay was found to be some 10 km downstream from the site near the modern towns of El Pan and Sevilla de Oro. Samples of clay sources, both those utilized by modern potters of Chordeleg, Jataunpamba, and Cuenca and ones which may have been used in ancient times were collected for analysis. Samples of Formative and later ceramics were selected from excavated and survey collections made at selected highland and coastal sites, with an end to locating regions from which Pirincay obtained special ceramic wares. Finally, the eastern Andes around Sucua and Macas were visited to try to locate the sources of Red Banded Incised ceramics, a ware widely traded in the southern lowlands and highlands during the terminal Formative. PERU. During October of 1990 Warren Church (YU) directed the excavations at Manachaki Cave as part of the continuing effort by the Rio Abiseo National Park Research Project to document regional chronol- ogy in the northeastern Andes near Pataz. Preliminary investigations suggest that Manachaki Cave has served as a shelter for travelers entering and leaving the rain- forest since the Preceramic period. The cultural sequence at Manachaki Cave begins in the early Preceramic with stemmed projectile points perhaps related to El Inga and Paijan styles. Un- stemmed points are triangular with concave bases. Un- fortunately, chronological relations between stemmed and unstemmed points are not yet clear because of mixing in the lowest strata. Small pottery vessels with carinated bodies and incised applique decoration are included in a large sample of Initial period ceramics. Subsequent ceramic periods are represented with the exception of the Middle Horizon and Late Interme- diate period. Within the shelter, archaeologists iden- tified 35 occupation floors and excavated 22 hearths. In addition to supplying a needed cultural chronology for the area, it is hoped that study of the organic con- tents from floors and hearths, coupled with sequences of ceramic and lithic artifact styles and paleoenviron- mental studies of the valley, will render an integrated historical sequence of highland-rainforest interaction in this part of Peru. In 1989, Elke Cedr6n (UniversidadNacional de Tru- jillo [UNT]) completed analysis of cultural materials from the site of La Playa excavated in 1985 during a joint effort of the University of Colorado-Boulder and UNT. This upper rainforest site consists of at least 18 circular stone buildings of which three were excavated in an effort to establish dates of occupation and build- ing functions. Building No. 14, which measures ap- proximately 8 m in diameter, was the focus of hori-</page><page sequence="11">156 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] zontal exposures. A 1r-m-square stone platform or "altar" and stone-lined rectangular hearth dominate the center of the building. A series of architectural details, and the close association of the "altar," the hearth, and artifacts (including a worked quartz crystal and decorated imperial-style Inka ceramics) suggest that ceremonial activities were carried out in this structure. A heavily oxidized piece of iron, which may be part of a horseshoe, was apparently left at the foot of the "altar" as an offering. This indicates a Colonial period component for La Playa and suggests that this area was not abandoned immediately following the Spanish Conquest. During summer of 1989, Warren Church (YU) and Elke Cedr6n (UNT) examined several archaeological sites close to the highland-rainforest ecotone near Bo- livar in the northeastern Andes of Peru. The sites of Ino, Pacarishka, Pururo, and Incapirca-among oth- ers-were briefly visited. Surface ceramics were absent at all of the hilltop sites. Most sites have defensive characteristics including outer walls with defensible en- tries. The architectural variability in this area is strik- ing. Some sites are made up of agglutinated rectangular structures with fine stone construction reminiscent of Marcahuamachuco and sites of the upper Maranion Valley, while others consist of circular constructions. An unexpected find was the presence of rectangular buildings with cornices reminiscent ofthose commonly found on circular buildings at Kuelap and Gran Pa- jaten. Stone sculpture such as carved sandstone slabs in high relief and tenoned heads are commonly found at these sites. Carved slabs depict felines, monkeys, and abstract designs, and tenoned heads portray hu- man heads or heads with human and feline character- istics. Funerary chambers were set into cliff faces or were built into niches created by fallen boulders. From Bolivar, there are six traditional routes of pen- etration into the forested upper Bombonaje and Pa- jaten valleys. Prehispanic paved roads were observed in the tributary valleys of Yonan and Pururo. The site of Incapirca, located at the forest's edge in the Yonan River valley, consists of an Inka-style house group (kancha) and a large rectangular building (kallanka). The kallanka measures 16.5 x 4.5 m with two entries in the long wall facing west. It is hypothesized that forest populations may have periodically united to par- ticipate in Inka-sponsored rituals at Inkapirca. Archaeological investigations were carried out for eight months at the site of Puemape located along the shore of the Cupisnique Valley between Chicama and Jequetepeque. Carlos Elera (Museo de la Naci6n [MN]) and Jose Pinilla Blenke (MN) directed the mapping and excavation of this 20-ha site. The research revealed evidence of habitation, cemeteries, and temples span- ning the Initial period and Early Horizon. A relative chronology for the Initial period and Early Horizon was established on the basis of stratigraphic evidence, and this sequence shows that the Monte- grande style, known from M. Tellenbach's excavations in Jequetepeque, immediately precedes the classic Cupisnique style, best known from Larco's excavations at Barbacoa and Palenque. Abundant materials were recovered that shed light on the economy, domestic activities, and funerary practices during the earliest (i.e., mid-Initial period) occupation of the site when Montegrande-style ceramics were used. The funerary practices of the Classic Cupisnique phase were also intensively studied. The Cupisnique burials were vari- able in their construction, and included simple pit graves, tombs built of a stone resembling pumice and burial chambers of algaroba logs. Burial associations demonstrate the contemporaneity of Larco's Santa Ana style with Classic Cupisnique pottery. A major Cup- isnique temple built of stone and clay mortar was en- countered, though most of it remains interred beneath vast sand dunes. Studies were carried out linking the native and migratory species of the Puemape area to the representations found in Cupisnique iconography. The investigations at Puemape also yielded infor- mation on the post-Cupisnique occupation of the site (i.e., late Early Horizon) when white-on-red painted ceramics characterized the artifact inventory. An im- portant finding is that while the two Initial period oc- cupations were associated with marine resources typ- ical of cold waters, the late Early Horizon remains were found with the marine resources characteristic of warmer tropical waters. This suggests the possibility of significant climatic changes in this area perhaps re- lated to a major El Nifio event. Juan Castefieda (UNT) and Flor Vega (UNT) are conducting a survey of Cupisnique sites on the south- ern side of the Chicama Valley. They have located windbreaks and villages in the Quebrada de Tres Cru- ces that appear to correspond to a short occupation. They hypothesize that these populations may have been taking advantage of higher precipitation due to an El Nifio event. Most of the ceramics recovered are do- mestic in function and consist of neckless ollas. Rocio Esquerre (UNT) and Rosario Becerra (UNT) area studying the Preceramic Paijain occupation of this same zone. They have identified workshops and temporary camps in the quebradas adjacent to Cerro Tres Cruces and have recovered projectile points and other artifacts in the Paijan tradition of the north coast. In 1989, Glenn Russel (Columbia University) and Banks Leonard (University of California-Los Angeles [UCLA]) began a settlement survey of the Chicama Valley. During the first field season, 25 percent of the survey area was covered and 193 sites were studied, as well as roads, canals, and other archaeological fea- tures. Segundo Vasquez (UNT), Cesar Galvez (Instituto Na- cional de Cultura [INC]), and Regulo Franco (INC) are currently investigating the site of El Brujo in the lower Chicama Valley. The site was first occupied in Gallin- azo times, but its principal occupation corresponds to the Moche culture. Spectacular Moche polychrome friezes were uncovered on the facade of Cao Viejo (Hu- aca Blanca). The newly discovered wall decoration cor- responds to the last two phases of the Moche occu- pation of the site. The earliest friezes consist ofgeometric motifs (stylized fish or snakes) and small panels 50 cm in height depicting the decapitation theme, apparently with young children shown as the victims. The later Moche friezes that decorated different platforms of Cao Viejo's frontis show anthropomorphized figures, known as "decapitators" (degolladores) arranged in a sequence of adjacent panels. In one section, life-size personages</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH 157 appear hand-in-hand against a gray backdrop; they are painted red, yellow, and white, and are delineated in black. Excavations have also unearthed a room the exterior of which is completely covered with different iconographic themes, many of which have no antece- dent in previous studies of Moche art. El Brujo was used as a cemetery after its abandonment as a major center, and dozens of burials with Lambayeque- and Chimu-style grave goods have been documented. In the mid-Moche Valley, Brian Bilman (University of California-Santa Barbara) has been carrying out an intensive archaeological survey. He has located nu- merous Initial period and Early Horizon sites, many of which were previously unknown. In the Viru Valley, Carmen Oliden (UNT) is studying technological con- tinuity in Chimu ceramics. At the site of El Niiio (Hu- aca Verde) Oliden has found decorative traditions that extend from Gallinazo into the final phases of Chimu. While there are few changes in decorative technique, there are notable changes in vessel form. Manuel Tam (INC) has completed an excavation of a small Early Horizon public structure at Huaca Verde. This con- struction was decorated with low-relief monochrome geometric wall decoration. Genaro Barr has defined a cultural and stratigraphic sequence at the Pampa La Cruz in Huanchaco. He interprets these materials as showing continuity be- tween the Salinar and Gallinazo cultures. Research at the Initial period center of Mina Perdida, Lurin Valley, was initiated in August, 1990. The map- ping of the site, clearing of a standing profile, and test excavations were carried out under the direction of Richard Burger (YU) with the assistance of Bernadino Ojeda (Centro de Investigaciones de Zonas Aridas) and students from the archaeology program of San Marcos University. An old looters' trench had penetrated the core of the 2 1-m-high U-shaped mound complex. By clearing the eroding cut, it was possible to document a 55-m-long stratigraphic profile with a maximum depth exceeding 11 m. This exposure revealed 22 building episodes, including a sequence of 4 superimposed cen- tral staircases. In contrast to previously investigated Initial period complexes on the central coast, Mina Perdida appears to have been built through accretion over a period of probably seven to 10 centuries. Changes over time can be observed in techniques used in the construction and artificial filling of these public buildings. The most striking technological change was a shift from cubical adobes to stones for the building of the walls. A parallel change occurred from angular stone fill to bagged fill. The first season of investigations confirmed that the later constructions at Mina Perdida were contemporary with the occupation and construction of Cardal. Two small test excavations on the plain behind the central mound recovered Initial period ceramics and other refuse that indicate the presence of a habitation zone associated with the public constructions. The skeletal material from the Yale University ex- cavations at Cardal in the Lurin Valley is being studied at the Archaeometry Laboratory of the Missouri Re- search Reactor by Sarah Meadors (University of Mis- souri-Columbia [UMC]) with Michael Glascock and Hector Neff collaborating on the research. Preliminary ftndings on the trace-element composition of the bone indicate include a barium/strontium ratio that is far lower than most values reported for horticulturists, but at the high end for foragers. During the summer of 1990, Robert Benfer (UMC) and Eric White (UMC) conducted salvage excavations at Paloma, where the construction of chicken pens re- cently destroyed a large section of the site. In the lab- oratory, White studied the lithics and Benfer com- pleted studies of bone, shell, and miscellaneous artifacts from earlier UMC excavations at Paloma. Presently, plant and animal specimens from the Pal- oma excavations and Benfer's 1989 reexcavation of Tres Ventanas are being identified by Deborah Pearsall (UMC) and Elizabeth Reitz (University of Georgia). The analyses are not yet complete, but large numbers of anchovies are being encountered in Paloma storage pits, and very early potatoes appear to be present at Tres Ventanas. Stable-isotope results for Paloma from Michael DeNiro's (UCLA) laboratory yielded values expected from a diet of marine carnivores. Recent excavations carried out by Roger Robinson (Antelope Valley College) under the auspices of the California Institute for Peruvian Studies (CIPS) and the Universidad Cat6lica Santa Maria de Arequipa (UCSM) at the Hacha site (PV 74-6) in the Acari Valley continue to shed new light on the early settlement of this region. Originally thought to represent a single cultural expression dating to the Initial period, the site is now known to contain two distinct cultural com- ponents. The earlier consists of adobe-walled domestic structures with associated hearths and refuse middens containing a distinctive ceramic style not hitherto known at the site. A series of eight radiocarbon deter- minations places this component at approximately 1100-800 B.C. This temporal position coincides with the Initial period/Early Horizon boundary in this re- gion. The later component cannot be dated accurately as it is limited to the surface of the site. It is these materials, including chipped-stone "hachas" (probably hoes), projectile points (including obsidian), and the ceramic style that were originally used to place the site in the Initial period. These artifacts must now, by vir- tue of their later position (surface and upper fill), be placed within the Early Horizon. Analysis of the fauna from both components by Jonathan Kent (Metropol- itan State College of Denver [MSC] and CIPS) is near- ing completion and provide new data on the nature of highland-coastal interactions during the Formative in this area. Also from the Hacha site come new insights on tex- tile-manufacturing techniques, under analysis by Grace Katterman (University of Arizona). Weaving technol- ogies unreported in Gayton's earlier work show unique combinations of methods employed in the earlier com- ponent at the site. Some are unlike techniques known in both Preceramic and Initial period sites elsewhere on the central or northern coast of Peru. Katterman believes there is evidence for a southern, independent development of a sequence from twining to interlacing to weaving. Georgia Britt (Washington University [WU]) is an- alyzing ceramics from excavations carried out at the site of Sahuacari (PV 74-2), codirected by Patti Wright</page><page sequence="13">158 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] (WU) and Jonathan Kent (MSC). At this site, originally discovered by Menzel and Riddell in 1954, recent ex- cavations of several superimposed strata from struc- tural and midden contexts revealed substantial quan- tities of botanical, faunal, and ceramic remains. One of the problems being addressed is the precise temporal placement of what Menzel has called the "Late Acari" style. Jonathan Kent (MSC) and Makoto Kowta (Califor- nia State University-Chico) have identified a substan- tial Middle Horizon component at the Tambo Viejo cemetery site (just south of the residential site of Tam- bo Viejo [PV 74-1]). The component is tentatively dated to early in the seventh century A.D. (based on 14C determinations) and stylistically related to MH 1B/2A. Interestingly, the burials related to this component of the cemetery seem to be divided spatially according to age, suggesting an age-graded society. Status was not ascribed, however, as none of the infant/juvenile bur- ials contained elaborate grave offerings. Beginning with the cemetery's Nasca 6-8 component, ceramic stylistic attributes change gradually and a peaceful transition between late Nasca and Middle Horizon is inferred. Finally, Carol Howell (University of Denver) and Jonathan Kent (MSC) are investigating corral-like structures at Quebrada de la Vaca (PV 77-3), near Chala. One intriguing aspect of these corral-like structures is the presence of alignments of small stones on the floor of one of the enclosures. The shape of the stone align- ments replicates the shape of several of the other en- closures and may be a record-keeping device related to camelid cargo transport. Incorporated into the walls of many structures are circular-to-ovoid cists contain- ing a wealth of organic material, including dung, ca- melid bone, and sea-urchin parts. In 1989, the Patacancha Project, directed by Ann Kendall (London), mapped the ruins of Pumamarca and Lomadas in the Patacanacha Valley, located 58 km northeast of the modem city of Cuzco. Excavations were carried out at these two sites during June and July of 1990. At the Pumamarca fort, the investigations determined that building B2 was a square structure built of rough selected stone. A trench across the back of the building unearthed evidence of burning over the original floor. Only one building (B4) at the site had been constructed in classic Inka style with well-pre- pared masonry blocks. The excavations at Pumamarca revealed that evidence of occupation was not deep and consisted mainly of Inka-style pottery and associated artifacts. Some Killke-style ceramics were found mixed with the Inka-style materials. There is evidence that the site was burnt prior to the construction of B4, but it continued to be occupied subsequently by people using Inka pottery. Lomadas, a promontory site located below Puma- marca, showed clear evidence of two main phases of Inka presence and a Killke-related phase that predated the two Inka phases. One classic Inka-style rectangular building (B 1l) was partially excavated. An earlier building was located beneath B 1 1 that contained a mix- ture of Inka and Killke styles of pottery; in the corner, investigators unearthed a cache of four Inka-style metal artifacts. Under the floor of the earlier building was evidence of a pre-Inka occupation of an earlier phase of the Late Intermediate period. Two constructions (B6/B7 and BI) that lacked classic Inka features were also excavated. A Spondylus shell pendant, a gold se- quin, and 10 other pieces of metal were recovered at the Lomadas site. Garth Bawden (University of New Mexico) is con- tinuing research on the far south coast north of the port Ilo. Field research to date has concentrated on iden- tifying settlement and land-use patterning and deter- mining the range of subsistence zones utilized by pre- historic and colonial populations of the area. This has led to reconstruction of the coastal settlement pattern from the port of Ilo north for roughly 40 km for the time period from approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 1600. This work has produced significant changes in un- derstanding of coastal subsistence and cultural evolu- tion on the far south coast. First, the hypothesis that highland influence was responsible for sedentary oc- cupation, pottery production, and agriculture in this area has been largely discounted, and the coastal oc- cupation now appears to have evolved along an in- dependent course. Second, an "Early Ceramic" tradi- tion of indigenous coastal agriculturists has been identified with dense populations clustering in local spring "oases" and dating to at least 250 B.C. Third, the Late Intermediate period was characterized by two ethnically distinct coastal groups exploiting agricultur- al and marine resources, respectively, and exchanging the complementary fruits of their efforts. This is a clear archaeological example of a coastal pattern previously known from historic accounts. Ongoing work will concentrate on further examining the nature of ethnicity and related economic interac- tion in the late period and the role of highland-coastal relations in the emergence of coastal civilization. This information will allow better understanding of the or- igins and evolutionary parameters of traditional inter- zonal economic interactions in the Andes with their adaptive kinship and property-ownership patterns and persistence of long-range socioeconomic links between home community and transplanted colony. During the summer of 1989, Maria Lozada and Bar- ra O'Donnabhain (University of Chicago [UC]) un- dertook a 6-week excavation of an Early Ceramic cem- etery at Wawakiki near Ilo in southern Peru. The cemetery is the earliest-known example of formal dis- posal of the dead in the south-coastal region. It appears to contain a representative mortuary sample. A typical grave contained an individual interment placed in a simple pit that was usually lined with vegetal material. Body position and grave orientation were variable. The ceramics recovered were all simple, undecorated bowls except for one undecorated neckless olla. Stone projectile points and bone implements, as well as shell and bone beads, were recovered from the burials. Some graves had been sealed with mud caps and possible grave markers were identified. All of the skulls recov- ered had evidence of annular cranial deformation. The cranium of an infant had a complex wrapping that may represent a deforming device. Similar headdresses were also found on adults. There was evidence of the delib- erate reopening of graves in antiquity to facilitate the removal of skulls, presumably for some ritual purpose. The mortuary behavior observed at Wawakiki dis-</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH 159 plays continuity with earlier Preceramic sites in the area. The closest parallels to this cemetery are to be found at contemporary Early Ceramic sites in northern Chile. This apparent initial appearance of formal dis- posal of the dead in the south-coastal region has im- portant implications for the possible restructuring of social and political ideology for the community that buried at the site. Paul Goldstein (UC) reports on ongoing investiga- tions on the Tiwanaku occupation of the Moquegua Valley, Peru. The Omo Project's 1986 and 1987 sea- sons concentrated on domestic habitation at the Omo site group, Tiwanaku's largest-known settlement out- side of Bolivia. The mapping and surface sampling of Omo's 40 ha of occupied area and the excavation and analysis of eight domestic structures occurred in 1986- 1987. In the 1990 season, the Omo Project concen- trated excavations on Omo site M I0's ceremonial cen- ter, the only Tiwanaku temple structure known outside of the altiplano. Principle occupations of bluff-top site components of the Omo group have been found to represent distinct phases of the Tiwanaku occupation. Data from the M 12 habitation site have demonstrated the Tiwanaku established substantial colonies of settlers in lowland agricultural zones at a far earlier date than previously believed. Ceramic associations and dated wooden posts from M12's 369 domestic structures place the com- munity in the mid-to-latter part of Tiwanaku phase 4, locally designated as the Omo phase (dated to A.D. 600 ? 70, calibrated). After an apparent hiatus that Goldstein believes may correspond to Wari intrusion from Ayacucho else- where in the valley, Tiwanaku control returned in more intensive and long-lived form during Tiwanaku phase 5 (A.D. 750-950), locally known as the Chen Chen phase. During this phase, represented at Omo by the M10 habitation site (structures dated to A.D. 900 + 60, calibrated), Tiwanaku hegemony was represented by an absolute dominance of Tiwanaku material cul- ture in domestic contexts, as the state established a hierarchical settlement system, expanded and inten- sified canal-fed agriculture, and constructed public ar- chitecture dedicated to state administration. 1990 excavations discovered a characteristic Tiwa- naku semisubterranean temple in the upper terrace of an adobe-platform structure. The existence of such a sunken court over 300 kilometers away from the state's core region indicates that the Tiwanaku system of ad- ministrative/ceremonial centers known from its Cir- cum-Titicaca satellites was also extended to annexed peripheral zones. The structure has been dated to A.D. 886 ? 50 (calibrated) placing it within the Tiwanaku 5 expansion. Finally, a postexpansive Tiwanaku-derived cultural complex, locally designated as the Tumilaca phase and represented at Omo site MI 1, appears to have persisted after the decline of the Tiwanaku state. It was a prin- ciple source of the later Chiribaya and Tricolor del Sur traditions. Paleofloods associated with past El Niiio perturba- tions were investigated in the lower Rio Osmore area near Ilo by Michael E. Moseley (University of Florida [UF]), Dennis Satterlee (UF), Jorge Tapia (UP), Karen Wise (Northwestern University) and members of the Programa Contisuyu in May through August, 1990. From the earliest to the latest, regional episodes of flooding identified in multiple drainages include: a Bas- al Sequence Miraflores Event (A.D. 1360 + 35, PITT- 9847), which interdicts Chiribaya settlements occupied after A.D. 1000; the Chuza Event, which immediately overlies volcanic ash from the February, A.D. 1600, eruption of Huayna Putina; and mudflows from the 1982-1983 El Niiio. The 1982-1983 El Niiio was the worst of the twen- tieth century, but evidence of earlier floods of com- parable or lesser magnitude is apparently not pre- served. Thus, the paleoflood record is dominated by events of exceptional magnitude. Severe erosion and deposition associated with the Chuza event is presum- ably a product of a 1604 earthquake estimated at 8.4 on the Richter Scale followed by the very strong El Niiio of 1607. The Miraflores Event produced even greater erosion and deposition that could be the prod- uct of either prior seismic activity (which is difficult to detect) or exceptionally prolonged or severe El Niiio conditions. The Chuza Event was grave, yet its damage pales in comparison to that of Miraflores, which ranks among the most destructive of arid Andean floods yet iden- tified. Uniquely high river and tributary flow combined with extensive sheet wash to completely and perma- nently decimate the largest canal-irrigation system ever built in the lower Osmore Valley. The independent Miraflores drainage experienced an massive 500-x-700- m mudflow that overran a large settlement, sweeping away all standing architecture as well as the sustaining agricultural system. It is likely that the regional scope of economic and demographic disruption from the Miraflores Event contributed to the Chiribaya cultural decline. In 1991, the Lupaqa Project, directed by Charles Stanish (Field Museum of Natural History) completed the third field phase of research in the southwestern region of Lake Titicaca, southern Peru. To date, ap- proximately 430 km2 between the modern towns of Ilave and Pomata have been intensively surveyed. We have also excavated three major sites in the region. The survey covered approximately 30 km along the lake shore with additional coverage that varied be- tween 5 and 20 km away from the lake. Approximately 450 sites representing more than 800 occupations have been discovered. These sites range in date from the Archaic (3 sites) to the early Spanish Colonial period. The Lupaqa Project documented a substantial local Upper Formative period settlement system, recently named "Sillumocco," as well as sub- stantial Middle Horizon, Late Intermediate period, and Late Horizon settlements. Three areas of extinct raised fields, associated with Sillumocco and Tiwanaku sites, were also recorded on survey. BOLIVIA. During the 1990 field season, the Proy- ecto Wila Jawira, a multidisciplinary archaeological project directed by Alan Kolata (UC) and Oswaldo Rivera (Instituto Nacional de Arqueologia de Bolivia [INAR]) continued research at Tiwanaku and affiliated settlements and agricultural landscapes. The project is</page><page sequence="15">160 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] investigating the nature, scope, and variability of Ti- wanaku's domestic and monumental architectural complexes, and the relations between this city and its sustaining hinterland. Ongoing interrelated research includes regional survey, intensive mapping and ex- cavation programs at the site of Tiwanaku, paleoeco- logical research focused in the near-shore environment of Lake Titicaca, and experimental rehabilitation of raised agricultural fields. During 1989 and 1990, a systematic survey of the lower Tiwanaku Valley, an area of approximately 200 kM2, was completed. Out of the 512 archaeological sites identified, 16 were mapped, and 5 were test excavated. The Formative period (ca. 1500 to 100 B.C.) is char- acterized by the formation of clusters of sites, located in intermediate zones, between the valley floor and the higher hilltops. Only three settlements are associated with the Ti- wanaku III period, suggesting a concentration of the valley population in nucleated areas outside the Lower Valley. Tiwanaku IV is represented by 50 sites, located within raised fields, broad terraces, and minibasins. The most outstanding feature of the settlement config- uration is the regular spacing among large sites (3-10 ha). Tiwanaku V settlements number 132. The major difference with respect to Tiwanaku IV is the expansion ofthe larger settlements and the proliferation of smaller sites. The post-Tiwanaku era has been divided into three periods: Early Pacajes (A.D. 100-1470), Pacajes-Inka (A.D. 1470-ca. 1540) and Late Pacajes (ca. 1540-1600). Early Pacajes is represented by 438 sites, most of which do not exceed 1 ha in size. Early Pacajes is a local development, as indicated by settlement and ceramic continuity with respect to the previous Tiwanaku V period. There are 290 sites associated with the Pacajes- Inka period; no drastic settlement reorganization is evidenced by the Inka intrusion in the area. This pat- tern suggests the use of local pre-Inka power structures as an administrative strategy. The colonial settlement pattern of the Late Pacajes period, represented by 329 sites, shows continuity with the previous period. Test excavations were performed at one Formative period site (LV- 174), three Tiwanaku sites (LV-55, LV- 109 and LV-150), and one Early Pacajes site, (LV-23). A semisubterranean patio wall was uncovered at LV- 174, suggesting possible similarities with Chiripa. At LV-55 and LV-150, the remains of habitation struc- tures were discovered. No such features were identified at LV- 109 which, based on the surface material scatter, may have been an obsidian workshop. LV-23 has a fortified sector that is outlined by a massive 350-m- long wall; no domestic units were found within these confines. LV-23 may have served as a temporary refuge area during raiding episodes. Excavations at Tiwanaku focused on a number of functionally distinct areas within the site. Broad hor- izontal excavations under the supervision of Howard Earnest and Kathryn Sampeck (UC) continued at the Putuni, an elite residential complex. A series of dedi- catory burials associated with the Tiwanaku V period occupation of the structure was encountered. One shaft- and-chamber tomb yielded a female with an elaborate necklace of sodalite, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and bone beads, multiple copper bracelets, and a gold pectoral plaque with a repousse human face design. Accom- panying the burial was a textile-wrapped bundle con- taining a circular copper mirror, copper tweezers and pins, and a long-necked lead flask. A series of six ra- diocarbon dates for Putuni's Tiwanaku V phase oc- cupation yielded a range between A.D. 760 and 980. Deeper excavations revealed Tiwanaku III and IV phase occupations as well as a stratum of Formative period ceramics. Domestic residences in the eastern sector of Tiwa- naku were excavated by John Janusck (UC), Marcos Michel (INAR), and Chris Begley (UC) in work con- tinuing from prior seasons. Over 20 structures dating to Tiwanaku IV and V phase occupations have been uncovered in this sector of the site to date, and ongoing spatial and artifactual analyses being conducted by Jan- usck suggest a broad spectrum of domestic household activities, including small stone-tool production, weaving, and food preparation. A ceramic workshop on the eastern periphery of the site was located and partially excavated by Evan Franke (UC) and Claudia Rivera (INAR). Nicole Couture (UC) began work in the Mollo Kontu (southern) sector of the site, concen- trating her activities on clearing sections of a small, circular mound structure of uncertain function and an area of domestic refuse. In the Lakarania (northern) sector of Tiwanaku, Javier Escalante (INAR) cleared a large circular structure (&gt;5 m diameter) and asso- ciated architectural features set on an artificial terrace. Because of the architectural context, absence of interior domestic debris and features, high-entry threshold, and a unique double-paved floor, Escalante interprets this structure as a store room. In the same northern sector, Anne Helsley (UT) excavated in an area of deep, do- mestic refuse and encountered a complex set of struc- tures and potential outdoor activity areas. Ongoing specialized analyses of artifacts and eco- logical data include: ceramics by Cheryl Sutherland (UC) and Sonia Alconini (INAR), faunal remains by Ann Webster (UC), lithics by Martin Giesso (UC), or- ganic residue and trace-element analysis by Michael Marchbanks (UW), and paleoethnobotanical analysis by Melanie Wright (University of Minnesota). Kolata and Charles Ortloff (FMC Corporation) investigated major canal and levee systems associated with Tiwa- naku raised agricultural fields in the Pampa Koani and Tiwanaku Valley (Wafia Jawira System), while Os- waldo Rivera supervised a Bolivian team of agrono- mists continuing investigations and experiments with rehabilitated raised fields. Richard L. Burger SOUTHERN CONE The past year has been a difficult one for archaeo- logical research in most southern-cone countries. Sev- eral colleagues write that much less funding was avail- able for field work, which largely accounts for the fewer number of research projects reported below. The past four years has witnessed the employment of several archaeologists and physical anthropologists in Argentina and Chile to document and exhume the</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT RESEARCH 161 in situ grave sites of the "desaparecidos," who lost their lives during the regimes of the most recent military govemments in those countries. The political situation has changed enough in Chile and Argentina to permit legal authorities and scientists of various disciplines to search for the tombs of the unfortunate victims of po- litical atrocities. It is very likely that over the next few years the "arqueologia de violencia politica," as one Argentine colleague categorized it, will develop and expand as more grave sites are encountered. ARGENTINA. Northwest. Maria Isabel Her- nandez Llosas (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas [CONICET], Instituto de An- tropologia e Hispanoamericana) is investigating the stylistic and material correlates of regional settlement and subsistence patterns in the quebradas of the Pin- toscayoc area (Quebrada de Humahuaca, Jujuy). Dif- ferent art styles expressed in rock paintings and on ceramic, wood, and other portable objects seem to be related to the distinctive land-use strategies of a lo- calized pattern of "economic complementarity" that varied in intensity and in organization through time and space. Ana Nelida Baraza, Cristina Lopez de Albornoz, and Hilda B. Garrido (Universidad de Tucuman [UT] con- tinued their interdisciplinary study of the late Prehis- panic and historic cultural and demographic conse- quences of changing subsistence strategies in the Tucuman area and their impact on the environment. Preliminary data analysis reveals that an indigenous pastoral and agricultural economy began to decline around A.D. 1400 as a result of intensive land use and overexploitation of grasslands and water resources. Other research activities of the UT team included the reconstruction of traditional technological systems, es- pecially agricultural techniques. Alicia A. Fernandez Distel reports that the Centro Argentino de Etnologia Americana (Jujuy) sponsored several interdisciplinary research projects in northwest Argentina, as well as in the Pampa and Patagonia. In conjunction with the Comite de Redacci6n del Dic- cionario Hist6rico de Jujuy, Distel is editing an ar- chaeological and historical site dictionary of the Jujuy Province. Fernando Valdez (Universidad Nacional de Jujuy) and Distel are producing a complete archaeo- logical map of the same province. Distel also began an archaeological and historical study of chullpas in Sus- ques (Atacama) and of the initial Spanish occupation in the region. She has obtained a series of late radio- carbon dates (averaging about A.D. 1540) for chullpa construction in the region. Terrence D'Altroy (Columbia University), Christine Hastorf (University of Minnesota [UM]-Minneapolis), Timothy Earle (University of California-Los Angeles), Ana Maria Lorandi (Universidad de Buenos Aires [UBA]), and Veronica Williams (UBA) are studying the local political economy of the Inca state in the Calchaqui Valley (Salta). The specific goals of the proj- ect are to identify (1) elite and nonelite subsistence activities, (2) public and ceremonial activity and con- sumption, and (3) local craft production for elite ex- change. To date, excavations have been initiated at two Inca sites (Potrero de Payogasta and Cortaderas) and at two local Santamariana sites (Valdez and La Paya). Under the direction of Ana Maria Lorandi (UBA), Veronica Williams (UBA) initiated the Proyecto An- dagala (Catamarca) for the purpose of investigating the nature, scope, and variability of socioeconomic rela- tions between the Inca, foreign mitimae labor groups, and local populations. Excavations recently carried out in a ceremonial center and in a large residential area (Retambay) of the Potrero-Chaquiago site revealed the predominance of Provincial Inca and "Inca Mixta" ceramics over the Tucumaiio-Santiagueiio wares im- ported by mitimae groups from the eastern lowlands. Also recovered in the Retambay area was evidence of metallurgical production. Previous excavations in an- other residential area (La Solana) revealed a higher frequency of Tucumanio-Santiaguenio wares, in addi- tion to evidence of ceramic, textile, and feather-adorn- ment production areas. Taken together, this informa- tion strongly implies differentiated economic activities for different residential areas. Valleserrana, Mendoza, and Neuquen. Mario Gambier (Universidad Nacional de San Juan) contin- ued excavations at the Inca site of Alto Verde, situated on a lateral road in Calingasta. Cultural materials re- covered from a series of artificial caverns and storage units include a horizontally perforated rock (presum- ably for ventilation) in the roof of one cavern, human- bone remains, cotton and wool textiles, Chucuito-style Inca ceramics, ceramic pipes, and various adornments made of carved bone, metal alloys, gold, silver, blue lapiz, and malachite. Gambier also continued labora- tory research on archaeological materials recovered from Cerro Calvario, a Middle to Late Ceramic period site, and carried out additional survey in the lower Bermejo Valley and at the Guanacache Lagoon. Parana-Pampa. In 1990, Nora Flegenheimer (CONICET) directed more research on the technolog- ical organization of lithic procurement and production in the Tandilia hills. She has located two new quarry sites, one of which (La Liebre) is under excavation. The excavation revealed a large amount of intersite lithic variability. Flegenheimer's research team in- cludes M. Zarate (site-formation processes), A. Prieto and M. Paez (palynological studies), and A. J. T. Hull (accelerator mass spectrometry dating). Patagonia. Since 1988,LauraLuciaMiotti(Museo de la Universidad Nacional de la Plata, CONICET) has worked in conjunction with the research team of Augusto Cardich (Universidad Nacional de la Plata) to carry out an intensive archaeological survey in the vicinity of the late Pleistocene site of Los Toldos (Santa Cruz). Recent excavation at two rockshelter sites, AEP- 1 and AEG-2, near Piedra Museo, an ancient lagoon surrounded by active springs, has yielded stratified cul- tural deposits. The upper levels of site AEP- 1 contained stemmed triangular projectile points, end scrapers, and the bone remains of Lama guanicoe and Pterocnemia. The lower levels yielded several human-produced flakes, mammal-bone remains, including extinct camelid, and the fragment of a large fishtail point (ca. 12 cm long, 6 cm wide, and .3 cm thick) with channel flakes on both sides. This represents the first fishtail point re-</page><page sequence="17">162 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 57, No. 1, 1992] covered from a stratigraphic context on the Argentine side of Patagonia. The lower levels are tentatively dated in the late Toldense or Fell III sequence (ca. 9000 B.P.). Fewer artifacts were recovered from the AEG-2 site. The stone assemblage at AEG-2 is characteristic of a lithic workship. Cristina Bellelli (CONICET, Instituto Nacional de Antropologia) continued her work at Camp Cerdo I in Piedra Parado (Chubut). Stratified deposits contained a lithic blade industry in the deeper levels and stemmed projectile points and ceramics (Tehuelchense II) in the upper levels. Guanaco (Lama Huanicoe) was the pri- mary food source consumed through time, supple- mented by vegetal species. Rock art was also recorded at the site. A quarry site and several open-air habitation sites were also located. Luis Borrero (CONICET, UBA) and Jose Luis Lan- ata (CONICET, UBA) continued their work at Mitre Peninsula, where they have now obtained a series of radiometric dates, ranging from modem to 2300 ? 90 B.P. for various shell-midden deposits and interior sites. Another member of the research team, Victoria Hor- witz, excavated the Charles Furh 2 site. A local settle- ment-pattem study was also initiated in the Piedra del Aguila area with Beatriz Ventura. In collaboration with Sanguinetti de Bormida, Hugo Nami (CONICET) surveyed the Rio Chico Lake (Santa Cruz). URUGUAY. Since 1986, Jorge Femenias (Museo Arqueol6gico Municipal) has carried out extensive ar- chaeological salvage work in the Laguna Merin reser- voir (Rocha). Several earthen burial mound ("cerri- tos") and associated activity areas have been excavated. The mounds average approximately 1-5 m in height and 5-50 m in diameter and are affiliated with Late Ceramic period mound-building cultures in south- eastern Brazil. Excavations are planned in 1992 to re- cover human burial remains contained in the mounds. CHILE. Northern Chile and Atacama. In June and July 1990, Mario Rivera (Field Museum of Natural History), Arthur Aufderheide, and Marc Kelley (both UM-Duluth) headed a field school in Pisagua, coastal Northern Chile, under the auspices of Universidad Ar- turo Prat (Iquique, Chile) and with the collaboration of Alvaro Carevic (Iquique), Sean Murphy (University of Tennessee), and Luz Gray. The aim of this fieldwork was to define, from a biological basis, two different populations that coexisted on the coast of northern Chile between 1500 and 500 B.C. They represent Chin- chorro phase III and Alto Ramirez phase I. Two 14C measurements (calibrated) from Pis-7 confirm a Alto Ramirez phase I date: 2955 ? 155 B.P. (GX-16097) and 2695 ? 85 (GX- 16098). In this area, Alto Ramirez I represents the first migration to the coast from the highlands. DNA research on samples of soft tissue and bone (trabecular and compact) is being carried out, as well as a study of coca-chewing practices through a cocaine metabolite detectable in human hair. Microscopic an- atomical study, stable-isotope ratios of carbon, nitro- gen, and sulphur are being carried out on bone collagen by ion-ratio mass spectrometry. Bone mineral analysis of strontium, zinc, and calcium is being performed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Through these tech- niques, an attempt will be made to characterize the diet of the Alto Ramirez people. Virgilio Schiappacasse F. (Sociedad Chilena de Ar- queologia [SCA]) reports the findings of the complete excavation of the Archaic period site of Conanoxa in the Camarones Valley. The excavation resulted in the recovery of an extensive activity zone, which included lithic workshops and approximately 70 post molds, 25 of which still contained fragments of wooden posts. The post molds appear to represent 5 distinctive hab- itation structures associated with 6 hearths. Lithic and food-preparation areas were located outside the struc- tures. Primary flakes and bifacial preforms were the main items of production. Fine screening resulted in the recovery of microorganic materials and debris, in- cluding the remains of crayfish from the local river and of marine shellfish and fish from the coast (40 km to the west). Although analysis of the recovered cultural material is not yet completed, preliminary study of the settlement-subsistence patterns suggests that Cona- noxa was occupied intermittently by small groups for short periods. Research at Conanoxa has been carried out under the auspices of the Fondo Nacional de Cien- cia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT) Project 18-89. Valles Transversales-Central Valley. Diana Wag- ner, Gast6n Castillo, and Marcos Bikupovic (Museo Arqueol6gico de La Serena [MALS]) have recovered the tusk, cranial, and maxilla fragments of a masto- dont, the pelvic and foot fragments of a possible Amer- ican equid, and various bone elements of other prob- able extinct mammals from different localities of the La Roja site (La Serena). These faunal remains were contained in a clay layer overlaid by Pleistocene gravels in an ancient bog or lagoon located on the upper terrace of the Rio Elqui. As yet, no evidence of human activity has been found in association with these remains. Wag- ner and her colleagues also initiated a settlement-pat- tern study of the Quebrada del Calvario at the conflu- ence of the Rio Elqui and Rio Huasco. In 1990, Gast6n Castillo (MALS) and Miguel Cer- vellino (Museo Regional Atacama de Copiap6), in con- junction with Hans Niemeyer (SCA), provided new information on archaeological investigations at several Late Intermediate period sites along the Rio Pulido in the highlands of Copiap6. Excavation was initiated at Cabra Atada, a multicomponent site dating from the Molle to Diaguita and Inca periods (ca. A.D. 400- 1550). The Molle occupation is characterized by the presence of tombs and terraced platforms on hillsides. The following Middle Ceramic period (A.D. 600-800) is defined by circular, subterranean architectural com- pounds and other cultural features indicative of a strong affiliation with the Aguada culture of northwest Ar- gentina and of the Las Animas culture of Norte Chico. Smaller structures and a tambo were built by the later Diaguita-Inca people at the site. The Diaguita com- ponent also is associated with a large Inca administra- tive site located a few kilometers upvalley at Iglesia Colorado, where most of the local population resided. Nearby are two Middle Ceramic period localities, Pun- tilla Blanca, a pucara, and Quebrada Seca, a site con- taining three canals extending to Cabra Atado and nu-</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT RESEARCH 163 merous storage units. All evidence suggests that the Cabra Atado population produced agricultural crops for the Inca. Research at Copiap6 is funded by FON- DECYT. Another member of the MALS research team, Maria A. Rosado, is studying the diet and health of two pre- historic human skeletal populations from Bahia de Co- quimbo (La Serena). One population includes 62 skel- etons of Archaic age (ca. 4000 B.P.) from the El Cerrito and La Herradura sites. The other is a later Diaguita population of at least 59 skeletons from the El Olivar, La Serena, and Peniuelas sites. Rosado is identifying dental hypoplasia, caries, abcesses, and overall attri- tion of the skeletal remains, in addition to Harris lines, porotic hyperostosis, degenerative joint disease, per- iosteal and endosteal reactions, stature, sexual dimor- phism, cranial-base height, mortality profiles, and bone isotope levels. Preliminary results show that the Ar- chaic population primarily consumed maritime re- sources and used terrestrial plants and animals as sec- ondary resources. The later Diaguita people had a mixed economy, based primarily on agricultural and mari- time resources. Since 1981, information about trans-Andean Inca roads in central Chile and Argentina has increased con- siderably as a result of archaeological investigations under the direction of Rub6n Stehberg (Museo Na- cional de Historia Natural [MNHN]). In 1990, he di- rected extensive survey in the upper Elqui and Hurtado valleys. Stehberg reports that the primary Inca road ran parallel to the Andean cordillera uniting the Li- mari, Elqui, and Huasco valleys in Chile. Four lateral roads connect peripheral eastern and western areas (e.g., La Deidad, Paso Las Tortolas, Paso Ingaguaz, Hur- tado). Numerous tombs and other state facilities were associated with these roads. Thermoluminescence dates on Inca and Diaguita-Inca sherds were processed for two sites: Guandacol, A.D. 1400 (590 ? 70 B.P., UCTL- 265); La Laguna, A.D. 1250 (740 + 90 B.P., UCTL- 266); and A.D. 1390 (600 ? 70 B.P., UCTL-267). Maria Teresa Planaella (SCA), Rub6n Stehberg (MNHN), Blanca Tagle (SCA), Hans Niemeyer (SCA), and Carmen del Rio (SCA) are conducting extensive investigations of pre-Inca and Inca sites at Cerro Gran- de de la Companiia, a hilltop fortress located in the Cachapoal Valley. Both local and nonlocal Inca ceram- ics have been recovered. A series of radiocarbon dates from the site reveal a pre-Inca occupation dated be- tween A.D. 1380 (610 ? 80 B.P., UCTL-232) and 1450 (540 ? 50 B.P., UCTL-230), and an Inca occupation between A.D. 1480 and 1530 (510 ? 60 B.P., UCTL- 231, and 460 ? 45 B.P., UCTL-229). In addition to the archaeological data, the chronicler Ger6nimo de Bibar, writing in 1558, reported use of the fortress by local inhabitants at the outset of the Spanish Conquest. Araucania. Tom D. Dillehay (University of Illinois and Universidad Austral de Chile) and Americo Gor- don (Universidad de La Frontera) visited the extensive Prehispanic earthen-mound complex in the precordil- lera of Region 10. Forty-two additional mounds were discovered in the site complex, ranging in height from 5 to 10 m and in diameter from 15 to 60 m. A sketch map of the 82-mound complex, which comprises a 15 km area, was produced, and more late Prehispanic ce- ramics were recovered from erosional cuts. Canals. While spending the past year at the Uni- versity of Illinois, Patricia Curry (Cambridge Univer- sity) analyzed most of the archaeological material re- covered from her excavations at several shell-midden sites located near Puerto Eden. The preliminary results show several significant technological and subsistence changes related to the increased exploitation of a wider variety of both maritime and terrestrial resources. Patagonia. As part of their long-term research on the evolution of hunter-gatherer societies in the south- ern cone, Luis A. Borrero (CONICET, UBA) and Jose Luis Lanata (CONICET, UBA) were involved in sev- eral projects. In addition to carrying out survey at Lago Argentino (Santa Cruz, Argentina), they worked with Pedro Cardenas (Instituto de Punta Arenas, Univer- sidad de Magallanes) to excavate limited areas of My- lodon Cave. The stratigraphic columns of Saxon's 1976 excavation in the cave were restudied to clarify the depositional sequence of the natural and cultural layers and to extract material for chemical, paleomagnetic, and sedimentological analyses. Faunal remains includ- ed bone and dung samples of Mylodon sp. Samples of dung are under study for reconstruction of the diet of these large animals. One radiometric date of 11,330 + 160 B.P. (LATYR) was processed for one sample from the upper level of a dung deposit. Borrero and Lanata also carried out survey at the nearby Cerro Benitez site and excavated a limited portion of the Alero Dos Her- raduras Oeste site, where additional mylodon-dung samples were recovered. In relation to these projects, Nora Franco is examining local lithic resources, Lanata is studying the distribuiton of bone and lithic remains, and Borrero is analyzing site taphomony. In 1990 and 1991, Hugo Nami (CONICET) was as- sociated with several projects in Chile. He conducted limited excavations at Don Ariel Cave near Palli Aike Cave. Only late Prehispanic cultural debris was recov- ered, as evidenced by a series of radiometric dates (100 + 50 B.P., Beta-43038; 330 ? 50 B.P., Beta-43040; 770 ? 70 B.P., Beta-43041; 1120 ? 50 B.P., Beta- 43039). Nami and personnel at the Daniel A. Valencio Paleomagnetic Laboratory (UBA have been carrying out archaeomagnetic research on sedimentary deposits from several Patagonian sites in Argentina and Chile. Nami also continued his long-term replicative and ex- perimental work on lithic raw materials and on the manufacturing techniques of fishtail points from the southern cone and of Folsom points from North Amer- ica. Nami was also involved in limited excavations at Cueva del Medio and Alero Pedro Cardenas. One ra- diometric date of 7415 ? 165 B.P. (PITT-706) was obtained from a deeper habitation level at the latter site. Tom D. Dillehay</page></plain_text>
