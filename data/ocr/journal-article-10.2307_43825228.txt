<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Video Game Graveyard Just The today's as first ancient multibillion-dollar titan of cultures video games have global founding was video Atari, myths, game which, industry so in does the today's multibillion-dollar global video game industry The first titan of video games was Atari, which, in the early 1980s, put their 2600 video game system in millions of homes - a first "computer" for many American households. The industry crashed in 1983, in part because of substandard games, including a notorious flop based on Steven Spielberg's blockbuster E.T. , thought by many to be the worst video game ever made. (It was bad. Very bad.) Legend has it that Atari buried millions of unsold and returned copies of E.T. , and perhaps other titles, in a New Mexico dump as the com- pany struggled to stay afloat. Thirty years was long enough for the dump site - and the truth behind the story - to be lost. In 2013, media companies Fuel Entertainment and Lightbox acquired the rights to create a documentary about the video game crash of the early 1980s and to dig the Atari dump site, if it could be found. As both an archaeologist (and Director of Publications at the American School of Classi- cal Studies at Athens) and a child of that early video game boom, I contacted Fuel to ask about how the archaeology - excavation, documentation, reporting - would be handled. They invited me to take part, and I assembled a team that included Richard Rothaus ^ of Trefoil Cultural and Environmental and Bill Caraher of the University of North Dakota, Κ veterans of excavations in the Mediterranean Λ and the Americas, as well as video game historian Raiford Guins of Stony Brook Uni- versity and historian Bret Weber of the University of North Dakota. { In April 2014, the archaeological team, filmmakers, and curious locals converged on an Alamogordo landfill. The legend soon burst to life. In Basket 5, Rothaus recovered a boxed copy of E.T., complete with instruc- tions, catalogue, and Raiders of the Lost Ark insert. Like dig- ging in a pottery dump, coin hoard, or shell mid- den, each turn of the shovel or bucket loader exposed more games and hardware - thousands of cartridges representing dozens of titles. The year's worst sandstorm stopped the exca- vation, but the game-filled trench was photographed and thousands of artifacts were bagged for analysis and cataloguing. While many may think that the recent past isn't an appro- priate target for serious archae- ologists, University of Arizona archaeologist William Rathje once said that archaeology seeks to find items that have cultural value - value that he found in the Tucson Garbage Project, a decades-long effort to study trends in modern trash. The Atari project is in that tradition, and regard- less of the attention it received, the www.archaeology.org 11</page><page sequence="2">dig established that material produced in the 1980s, and even more recently, can have archaeological value. Further research will examine the composition of the deposit of games and hardware in conjunction with the surrounding levels of garbage to understand what hap- pened, from both business and cultural perspectives, when Atari dumped its dead weight in the desert. Some of the finds have already been sent to museums for display and conservation, and the archaeological team is now writing a preliminary report and a peerreviewed journal article. These Atari games are part of my generation's cultural heritage, and mark a tipping point in the history of tech- nology Two years after the crash, Nin- tendo released its own American game system, starting a second boom that continues today It is significant that the documentary, Atari: Game Over , will debut on Microsoft's Xbox, a direct descendant of the "ancient" culture that created this video game midden. Potentially millions more cartridges, along with other artifacts such as Atari computers, prototypes, and corporate documents, remain at the dump site. Future archaeologists will have their work cut out for them. I -Andrew Reinhard The tiny Caribbean island of Aruba is an ideai beach vacation spot, but tourists who venture away from the shore are in for a treat as well . Arikok National Park features an astonishing array of rock art made by the island's first inhabitants , the Caquetio people , who belonged to the Arawakan language family. More than a thousand years ago , they canoed to the island from northwestern Venezuela . Early European accounts describe Aruba as an " island of giants ," as the Caquetio were relatively tall. The Spanish were the first Europeans to colonize the island, followed by the Dutch, who, in the seventeenth century, made Aruba part of the Dutch West india Company, and have governed it ever since. While there are no longer full- blooded Caquetio, vestiges of their heritage remain. 12 The rock art of the Caquetio people, according to archaeologist Harold Kelly of the National Archaeological Museum Aruba, includes geometric, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic motifs in red, white, brown, and black. The art at one site, Cunucu Arikok, stands out for its complexity, variety, and quantity. "The combination of white and red colors in a single depiction is something that is not only unique I Aruba," for The far when the corn, a and cated Cunucu once site, restored has ba's "but large as rock been Caribbean, cucumbers site economy. which also cultivated millet, agriculture on we part Arikok says to art a partially know." the also farm the of of Aruba," says Kelly, "but also the rest of the Caribbean, as far as we know." The site Cunucu Arikok is lo- cated on a farm that has been partially restored to the time when agriculture was a large part of Aru- ba's economy. Beans, corn, millet, peanuts, and cucumbers were once cultivated at the site, which also has cactus hedges and stone walls to pro- tect those crops from livestock. Trails lead to the Caquetio rock art, including drawings of marine animals and birds that are visible on overhanging rocks just off the trail near the parking lot. More elaborate anthropomorphic designs can be found a short walk away, on the Cunucu Arikok dolerite rock formation within Arikok National Park. There, several complex human figures can be found among dozens of other works, including dynamic depictions of shamans carrying out rituals and, according to Kelly, going on mystical journeys. One of these is depicted in the unique red-and-white palette, with a figure intertwined with geometric patterns. The works are stunners both for their artistic merit and the insight they provide about the Caquetio belief system. Maps, guides, and educational activities are all avail- able at the park's visitor center. While you're there If you need a break from Aruba's white sand and blue sea, the park also of- fers hiking trails, unique wildlife, and Conchi, also known as the "Natural Pool," a remote tidal pool surrounded by jagged volcanic rock. The National Archaeological Museum Aruba, located in a historic home in downtown Oran- jestad, chronicles the island's history, from 2500 b.c. to the recent past. The capital is also a great place to sample Aruba's unique cuisine, which incorpo- rates Caribbean, Spanish, and Dutch influences.

University of California, Los Ange- les, archaeological scientist Ioanna Kakoulli made the discovery while analyzing the chemical makeup of a painting depicting Jesus, beneath which she found a plaster finish con- taining chrysotile, one of the minerals in the asbestos group. "We were not expecting to find chrysotile in twelfth- century paintings," says Kakoulli. "It has never been reported and we have never found it on any other Byzantine paintings." The heatrresistant properties of asbestos were known as early as 2000 B.c., when it was used to make pottery in Finland, and Roman artisans includ- ed it in fabrics used in funeral pyres to keep the ashes of the dead discrete. But scholars had believed asbestos was not used to make materi- als such as plasters until the Industrial Revolution. Kakr oulli thinks the monks knew or discovered that the min- eral made their plaster easy to smooth and able to be polished to a mirrorlike surface upon which to paint. She plans to return to the monastery and examine other wall paintings to determine how widespread the innovation was. - Eric A. Powell A Bold Civil War Steamer Off have archaeologists the identified South Carolina the believe remains coast, they of archaeologists believe they have identified the remains of Planter , a steamer that was associated with one of the most daring actions of the Civil War. Chartered by the Confed- eracy as a transport vessel soon after the war began, Planter* s second-in-command was Robert Smalls, an enslaved black man. On a spring night in 1862, while the ship's white crew attended a ball in Charleston, Smalls and the other black crewmen commandeered the steamer. After taking on his family, Smalls steered Planter past several Confederate forts and delivered the vessel to a Union 16 warship. Smalls was eventually appoint- ed Planter* s captain - the first African American to serve as ship's master in the history of the United States military After the war, Planter hauled pas- sengers and cotton along the South Carolina coast, and was abandoned after running aground during a severe storm in 1876. Archaeologists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) carried out a remote-sensing survey where Planter was thought to have been lost. They detected a series of magnetic anomalies that are likely concentrations of iron from the ship's boiler. "The site is in 10 feet of water and 15 feet of sand, so excavating will be nearly impos- sible," says NOAA archaeologist Bruce Terrell. "But because of its historical significance, we'll monitor the site to ensure it isn't threatened." - Eric A.

The Indian Removal Act resulted in the forced march in 1838 of 17,000 Cherokee from their homes in the Appalachian and Great Smoky Mountains to a reservation in Oklahoma. Along the way, whoop- ing cough, yellow fever, diarrhea, and exhaustion claimed many lives. Accord- ing to a new study, those who survived, and their descendants, also bore the marks of the trial. Ann H. Ross, an anthropologist at North Carolina State University, examined data on the skull size of Cherokee from the period following their removal - both among those who were relocated and some who had remained hidden in the Eastern moun- tains. Using records of Cherokee adult head size made in the early 1900s, she found that both the relocated Western Band and the hidden Eastern Band displayed reduced cranial length and breadth. Cranial size is determined in infancy and childhood, and smaller size is associated with poor nutrition and environmental conditions during this key developmental period. "We were surprised that there were changes in both bands," Ross says. "The Eastern Band, hiding in the Smoky Mountains, also suffered environmental stress." The study has implications for understanding the effects of humanitar- ian crises, large population movements, industrial development, and contact with outsiders, Ross says. She is also using this type of research to examine the impact of European arrival on Native American populations. - Marion P.

The burial complex is located in the state of Colima on Mexico's west coast.

The skeleton, which belonged to a young man who died around 1200 B.C., was riddled with lesions caused by cancer of an unknown organ. A team led by Michaela Binder of Durham University analyzed the lesions using X-rays and digital and scanning electron microscopy, and ruled out alternative causes, such as fungal infection or postmortem changes. Cancer has been thought to be a largely modern disease that results in part from longer life spans, exposure to pollutants and unhealthy food, and lack of physical activity Also, few ancient skeletons bear evidence of cancer, but this may be because the victims died rapidly, before the disease could leave a mark on their bones. The new find adds to evidence that the disease existed, and may even have been common, in antiquity. The site, called Amara West, has been studied since 2008, with excavations in the ancient town and cemeteries. Researchers hope that an understanding of the surrounding community will offer a window into the causes of cancer in ancient populations. - D aniel Weiss Make Room for the Memories.

They are our closest evolutionary cousins, but the differences between us run deeper than that 0.3 percent. Much of what distinguishes the two groups is actually the result of how and when genes are expressed and regulated - essentially, turned on and off. Similar, or even identical, stretches of DNA can produce vastly different traits, such as longer limbs or smaller brains, depending on how and when certain genes are actively producing protein. The study of these processes is known as epigenetics. Scientists at the Max Planck Insti- tute for Evolutionary Anthropology sequenced Neanderthal DNA in 2010, and now researchers there and at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem are beginning to understand some of the epigenetic differences between humans and Neanderthals. "Studying this is of equal importance to studying the genetic differences," says Liran Carmel of the Hebrew University. By looking at the way that Neander- thai DNA chemically degraded over millennia in the ground, the researchers were able to reconstruct how certain molecules, called methyl groups, were attached to the DNA. Methyl groups can help determine how much of a particular protein a gene creates. The research showed that certain Nean- derthal genes had different patterns of attached methyl groups, compared with corresponding portions of the modern human genome. As a result, strikingly similar stretches of DNA could pro- duce two very different hominins. For example, two genes involved in limb development have different patterns of methyl groups, which may be why we have longer arms and legs than Neanderthals did. Similar differences were observed in genes associated with brain development and susceptibility to certain diseases. Carmel believes that as more Neanderthal DNA is analyzed, we will ^ I begin to understand the evolutionary changes that I |ÉÉ¿? created the modern human. "There is a huge poten- tial," he says.

Researchers from the Rhode Island State Home and School Project have been piecing together the story of the previous, and less fortunate, young people who inhabited the grounds on which the campus stands. Between 1885 and 1979, more than 10,000 dependent and neglected children left their lasting imprint on the landscape as residents of the state's first public orphanage, still partially visible on the campus' eastern end. According to RIC anthropologist E. Pierre Morenon, "The Progres- sive Era women who lobbied for the creation of this place viewed it as a temporary home, or an alterna- tive to the almshouses, poor farms, and asylums of the late 1800s." The project has spent much of the past decade documenting, preserving, and honoring the childrens' experi- ences. Toys were the most common artifacts uncovered, among them marbles, jacks, toy trucks, soldiers, and roller skates. The objects are a sign that, despite their unfortunate circumstances, this young population might still have been able to experience childhood. -Jason Urbānus Taking a Dive Proof always found that among on ancient the 500,000 level wrestling has wasn't been frag- always on the level has been found among 500,000 frag- ments of papyri discovered in Oxyrhyn- chus, Egypt, more than a century ago. One fragment, recently scrutinized by historian Dominic Rathbone of King's College London, concerns a wrestling match between two teenagers, Nican- tinous and Demetrius, in A.D. 267. The contract, agreed upon by Nican- tinous' father and Demetrius' trainers, stipulates that Demetrius must "fall three times and yield." For his inten- tional submission, the loser would be paid 3,800 drachmas. Although match fixing is alluded to by some ancient Greek writers, according to Rathbone, "This is the first known papyrological evidence for bribery in an athletic competition." The agree- ment also specifies that should the boy renege on the deal, Demetrius' party would owe a penalty equal to 18,000 drachmas. -Jason Urbānus 22 ARCHAEOLOGY · July/August 2014</page></plain_text>
