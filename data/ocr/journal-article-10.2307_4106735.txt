<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOPING AND WISHING by Colin Radford and J. M. Hinton I Colin Radford The difficulty with such a topic is to avoid the mere proliferation of verbal distinctions, sub-Austinianism. i. Hopes and wishes are closely related and linked, I suggest, through being wants. But what are wants? "The teapot wants a lid" is roughly equivalent in force to, "The teapot lacks (and so needs) a lid, i.e., is incomplete and will not, therefore, function properly without one". The idiomatic, "He wants a good hiding" usually has the force of, "He needs a good hiding". Rarely does it mean, "He would like (desires) a good hiding" or even, "He would like (believes he needs) a good hiding". In contrast, "He wants a raspberry flavoured one" does have the force, "He desires a raspberry flavoured one" and does not mean or imply that he needs one. It is not surprising, given that we are animals which have evolved, that "wants" has these two main strands. "He is hungry" --"He wants, i.e., desires and needs, food". In contrast, "He feels hungry" --- "He desires to eat," and often such a remark carries an implication that he does not need to eat. Where wants are desires, hopes and wishes are wants. A person who hopes or wishes that . . . , or to . . . , or for ... eo ipso desires something which he may or may not need. Thus, a boy who hopes to get a bicycle for his birthday wants qua desires (to get) a bicycle for his birthday which he may need in no other sense than that he desires it, and a boy who wishes to get one similarly wants to get one. Sometimes the connexions are not so simple. Does a boy who wishes he had got a bicycle for his birthday and who, of course, did not get one, want to have got a bicycle for his birthday? It is natural 51</page><page sequence="2">52 COLIN RADFORD and tempting to say that he wanted a bicycle for his birthday, but he need not have done and yet now wish that he had been given one, and vice versa. Other cases of wishing may be harder to handle but it does appear that where there is a present hope or wish there is a present desire. I shall return to this question. Having tied hopes and wishes to wants I should look a little more at wants. "He wants to give up smoking" sometimes means, "He needs to give up smoking", and now we know that it is bad for us to smoke the remark may always carry this connotation. But it more often means, "He desires to stop smoking". The difficulty here is that anyone of whom we may appropriately say this is a smoker and hence someone who also desires to smoke. Such a man does not merely have warring desires, however, for his desire to smoke, which is immediate, is the object of his other, higher-order, normative and instru- mental desire which is to lose the desire to smoke and hence to stop, or at any rate to stop. It might be more perspicuous to say of such a man that he has three desires-a desire to smoke, a desire to lose the desire to smoke or, at least, to stop smoking, and a higher-order desire that his desire to stop smoking will overcome his desire to smoke or his habit or practice of smoking; and all this can be conveyed by the remark, "He wants to give up smoking". All smokers need to give up smoking in the sense that it is bad for their health and, locally, for their pockets. But do smokers who want qua desire to give up smoking and who characteristically find it difficult or impossible to do so, need to smoke ? Are there in such cases smoking needs which match the smoking desires ? My question is not physiological or psychological, though more nearly related to the latter since it is conceptual. Where a desire is pressing, so that if it is not satisfied it interferes with the other business of our lives, we tend to speak of a need, i.e., of something we must have if... , where what completes the account is a phrase mentioning something we see as important, such as our surviving, or getting a letter written or looking respectable. Desires, the satisfaction of which can in some not too weak fashion be thus seen as necessary, are seen as needs. It is not surprising if those subject to desires</page><page sequence="3">HOPING AND WISHING 53 describe them as needs for in this way they help to excuse their indulgence. But this way of speaking makes the connexion between such needs and their related desires logical, and so may be avoided, whereas some needs, e.g., for water, are causally connected with the desires that satisfy them. Plants (often) need water in that they will not survive without it or flourish without enough of it, but never feel thirsty; a man in certain pathological conditions will crave water but not need it in any further way. Not all needs are felt, though most psychological needs will be (see above), and where a need is only a strong desire it is less confusing, though less comforting, to call it that. 2. So hoping and wishing are closely related, but they are different. How? If wanting may be said to be incomplete, and it is not always, hoping is ignorant, wishing often idle. Unpacking this: if a man wants something, say a drink, either he desires a drink-in which case he presumably does not have a drink but would choose, if the cost were not too great, to have one-or, if he needs a drink and, oddly, does not desire one, again he lacks something for he does not have a drink and a drink would be beneficial to him. So wanting is incomplete- though not always-for a man can want something he has.1 Rag-and-bone-man: "Do you want that old battery there in your garage?" Owner: "Yes." Squash player (watching his opponent who is sinking a pint after the game): "Do you want that beer?" The here unspoken and superfluous answer is again "YES". We tend not to say of things we already have or of things which we believe we cannot have that we want them, not because we do not want those things but because the truth or truthfulness of a remark is nowhere near sufficient for its being made. In defence of Aquinas it might be argued that the man who wants the battery wants to keep the thing. It is his future possession and ownership of the battery that he wants and does not yet have. This is borne out by the fact that if the owner says, "No, I don't want it", this means that the rag-and- bone-man may take it away and not that the owner has been anxious to be rid of it. But, of course, he may have been anxious to be rid of it, in which case he will have had something</page><page sequence="4">54 COLIN RADFORD that he did not want; and his situation presumably contrasts with that of a man who has had a battery for some time and at no stage would have agreed to part with it. The latter will have had the battery and wanted it all along. Or, turning to the beer drinking squash player, he might have said sur- prisingly and in confidential tones, "Actually I don't want it but old so-and-so has bought it for me and I don't want to hurt his feelings". Apparently paradoxical consequences of Aquinas's thesis are that no one wants anything he has and that having got something he wants a man no longer wants it. But presumably Aquinas says this because he confuses wanting with lacking and so believes that a person's not having something is a logical condition of his wanting it, and not because he believes that having got something a person no longer desires it. For the latter is a contingent thesis and one that is clearly-and fortunately-very often false. Hoping is ignorant: a man may want something and know that he is going to get it or that he will not get it. But if he knows or, anyway, if he is sure that he is not going to get it, he cannot hope to get it-he believes he has no hope of getting it. Conversely, if he knows or is sure that he will get something he wants, he cannot hope to get it. But between these limits the strength of a man's hopes, how much hope he has, is a function of his confidence that he will get what he wants. Compare, "I have every hope ... ". "I have no hope ... ", "I am extremely hopeful ... ". "I hope very much that you get it", however, would be an inappropriate answer to the question, "How much hope do you have of my getting it?", because the reply mentions not the confidence, the degree of expectation, the strength of the belief that the questioner will get what he wants, but the intensity of the speaker's desire that his interlocutor will get it. We sometimes say of a man who is hoping for something- and even of one who is not hoping for that something-which we are sure that he will not get, that he has no hope of getting it. But our remark does not mean that he does not hope, only that he has no chance of getting it, so that if he hopes he must be disappointed. Similarly, the so-called "no hoper" is thought to have no chance by his maligner. "There is no hope . . . " is</page><page sequence="5">HOPING AND WISHING 55 just a colourful, anthropomorphic way of saying, "There is no possibility (chance, likelihood, etc.) ... " The foregoing makes it clear why a person with hope is happier than one without hope-unless the latter's desires have, happily, evaporated along with his confidence so that he has no hope in that dimension either. But because intense desire may combine with low expectation, a state of hope, though never wholly unhappy, can be unhappy and grow unhappier as and if time progresses, tension and frustration mount and expectation diminishes. Wishing is often and most itself when idle, but when not idle it is sometimes little different from straightforward wanting. Wishing is idle in this technical sense when the object of the wish is somehow seen by the wisher as impossible of achieve- ment.2 Compare, "I wish you would go on" which is often roughly equivalent to, "I should like (want) you to go on" plus some faint suggestion that the person addressed will not go on, with "I wish you hadn't stopped" which means, "I want you not to have stopped, i.e., to have continued. You stopped." Here the wanting is wishing precisely because the speaker knows or at any rate believes that what is wanted cannot be had. The speaker might say, "I didn't want you to stop", but that is a statement about his past desires not his present ones. There is an awkwardness in construing, "I wish you hadn't stopped" as expressing a desire presently felt; it seems more natural to construe the speaker as saying that he wanted the other to continue rather than he wants the other to have continued or wants that he had continued. But though awkward the construction is correct. For the wisher's statement is consistent with his admitting that, at the time the other stopped, he wanted him to stop. When he says he (now) wishes the other had not stopped he is saying something like, "If it were now possible for me to be able to choose whether you stopped or not, I would (now) choose that you had not stopped". The source of this awkwardness is, I suspect, and as I mentioned earlier, that declaring a want, like any other remark, needs a rationale-we don't just babble-which in the case of wanting is usually practical but which cannot be practical where the want is an idle wish. Since I am concerned with differences in this section, I shall</page><page sequence="6">56 COLIN RADFORD mainly be concerned, in as far as I am concerned with wishes, with idle ones and not with such cases as, "You will do exactly as I wish (i.e., want, desire, choose)" or, "I wish you luck". Nonetheless, and as the last example shows, wishing that is not idle is in certain cases more episodic, event-like, than hoping or plain wanting. If I hope things go well for you, I continue to hope that they do-unless my feelings change- until I hear how you got on, when I am glad or sorry, in which latter case I shall wish that you had done better and again continue to do so until my feelings about you or my judgment of the situation alter or simply decay with the passing of time. So wishing of either sort can be continuous, as it were; but my wishing you luck is itself a wish and not just the expression of a wish in the way in which my expressing my hope that you will do well is just the expression of a hope. The immediate, shallow explanation of this difference is simply that wishing words can refer to an episode or event, viz., someone's saying out loud or under his breath, "I wish . . . ", as well as to the content of a wish, i.e., what is wished, or to the wisher's wishing qua desiring something which desiring characteristically has duration. So that, "He wished you luck but didn't really mean it" reports that he expressed the wish qua desire that you would do well while hoping all the time and in his heart the opposite. Since hoping words do not have this episodic use, "He hoped that you would do well but didn't mean it" is very strained, the more natural expression would be, "He said that he hoped, etc." Of course, we allow that we can have flashes of hope, but the phrase which picks out this non-linguistic event or episode is "flash of hope", while hope itself is a state that lasts as long as the combination of desire and ignorance which constitutes it persists. The difference in usage explains, or is in part constituted by, the fact that we can be commanded to wish but not similarly to hope. Yet often when we comply with such commands, usually to avail ourselves of some auspicious occasion on which to wish, we express-though for superstitious reasons we may do so under our breaths and keep it to ourselves-a hope. The hopes expressed on these supposedly auspicious occasions are however often very faint ones which, if not on these occasions,</page><page sequence="7">HOPING AND WISHING 57 would on others be idle wishes. The little girl who has won the larger half of the wishbone screws up her eyes and wishes, i.e., makes a wish, "I wish Daddy would buy me a horse." She will use this form of words even if she thinks such wishes are very likely to come true. Perhaps the form, which suggests disbelief, is itself thought to be necessary for success? That wishing words have this episodic use, that wishes as events are thought to be sometimes able to help bring about what the wisher desires, and that we fall back on magic when more rational methods are unavailable or unlikely to work, all combine to explain the existence of wishing-rather than hoping-wells. Where the desire seems more attainable we have hope, e.g., hope chests (bottom drawers). But is there any deeper explanation of the episodic use of wishing words, i.e., of why "wish" and cognate words may be used to refer to mental or linguistic acts whereas hoping words do not have this use ? A partial explanation is, perhaps, provided by a further difference between hoping and wishing, which is that hoping is more behavioural or-better-less linguistic than idle wishing. I shall first give an account of this difference and then the explanation and its difficulties. The gross behaviour that is constitutive of idle wishing is saying, saying, "I wish . . . ", or anything which entails this; and a man wishes idly for something if, accepting an invitation to reveal something about his inner life, he could say "I wish . . . ", and mean it. Anything else, e.g., depression, is, characteristically, only a natural consequence or expression or measure-and by itself an inexact measure-of the intensity or importance of the wish, but not of its existence. The wish can exist and such behaviour be lacking. Its lack does not threaten the existence of the wish in the way in which a person's avowing that he does not (idly) wish that ... threatens its existence. Moreover, if a man wishes idly that, e.g., he had worked harder at school, or that he had (not) got drunk last night, there is nothing that he can do to achieve what he immedi- ately desires in wishing that . . . , just because the wish is idle. Of course, a man who wishes that he had worked harder at school usually wishes this because he has some further desire which could, he thinks, be satisfied had he worked harder at</page><page sequence="8">58 COLIN RADFORD school. He might have got five "0" levels instead of none and so be qualified to become a teacher which is what he wants to be. In this situation we may feel that we have some sort of test for determining whether he really does wish that he had worked harder at school which, if it does not eliminate what he says as determining what or whether he idly wishes, greatly reduces its r6le. Our test is whether he is now prepared to go to evening classes or do something of the sort to get the "0" levels. But the test is a very weak and indirect one. For the practical problems that now make it difficult for the man to get his "0" levels may be precisely what now make him wish so much that he had worked harder and got them while at school. We can imagine that such difficulties might be removed, but even then we might encounter another difficulty, viz., that since leaving school his desires and interests have multiplied and their satisfaction compete for his limited time, money, energy and attention, whereas at school, he may remember, he was bored and wasted his time doing nothing. Or he may feel that though he wants to be a school teacher he now lacks the confidence to try to get the "0" levels or that he has lost the ability he once had to get them. Even if there appear to be no real practical difficulties, and he has plenty of spare and idle time in which to study and yet does not study, he might still say, "I wish I had worked harder at school . . . " and when we ask him, "Why don't you work for them now?" he might say, "I really don't know. I do wish that I could but somehow I can't and that's why I wish I had worked harder at school". This is undoubtedly a puzzling reply, but if our man is serious and insists on it, we have to accept it. It is only if there are no difficulties, or if these are removed, and the man does nothing and then confesses, shamefacedly or perhaps with an air of surprise that he hadn't-couldn't have-been serious, meant what he said, that we can conclude that he does not really wish to get his '0' levels, and so does not really wish to be a schoolteacher and so does not really wish that he had worked harder at school. But this account concedes that the man wishes idly that he had worked harder at school if he says so and means it. More- over, some idle wishes are immediate and do not connect up with the wisher's hopes or vague aspirations as the one</page><page sequence="9">HOPING AND WISHING 59 discussed above does. If we suppose that the man simply wishes that he had worked harder at school, or wishes that he had worked harder at school because he wishes he had been a more industrious boy, there are no indirect tests at all. Or, to change the example, an old man thinking about his past life might wish that he had married the other girl because he believes that had he done so he would have been happier in his youth and middle age. It might look as if, even for such examples as these, we do have a test for determining whether a man really does idly wish that... over and above what he is disposed to say. The test, albeit an impractical one is this; that if believing what he now believes and feeling what he now feels, he were given his time over again, he were to do what he now says he wishes he had done, then and only then does he now really wish what- ever he claims to idly wish. But this is no test and, even if it were a test, i.e., a procedure we could use to find out whether a man now really idly wishes ..., it would not always yield a correct answer to our question. For if we unrealistically suppose that we could return our first man to his schooldays but knowing and feeling and wishing what he now knows and feels and wishes, he might still not work any harder but only say in heartfelt tones, "I do wish I could work harder . ..". If he does say this, and we accept the sincerity of his remark, then we should have to say that he wishes that he could work harder and so now wishes that.he had worked harder. And once again the test of what he wishes is, at least in part and even in this case, what he says, viz., "I wish I could work harder...". Now for this wish which, despite its grammatical form, we are not disposed to treat as idle or irretrievably so, there are tests besides what he says, but again the tests though direct are incomplete. And for idle wishes that are about things over which the wisher clearly never had any control there are no direct tests either. A man who has been betting all his life might say, "I wish I had won all this money twenty years ago when I was young enough to enjoy it", an historian might say, "I wish I had been born at the time of the French revolution", a wretched philosopher might say, "I wish I had never been born at all". 3</page><page sequence="10">60 COLIN RADFORD Continuing to test this account of idle wishing: suppose a man who never drinks alcohol is put on a course of medical treatment, told that in no circumstances must he drink alcohol and then professes an idle wish to have a drink. (The wish is idle because the man believes that he cannot have a drink.) Do we simply accept what he says provided he appears to mean it? And whatever answer we give to this question, does not the mere existence of a problem show that something in addition to whatever a man is disposed to say about his idle wishes has a direct, a logical bearing on whether he does indeed really wish whatever it is he professes to wish? If the man insists that he wishes he could have a drink, I think we do accept what he says and we call him perverse. This sort of perversity, wanting something "just because", as we say, we can't have it is quite common. It occurs frequently in children and in sexual matters amongst adults. And it is true that there is an incompatibility or incongruity between what the man now professes to idly wish and how he used to behave; but this is only because how he used to behave and what he used to desire are a guide to what a man now desires. But they are no more than a guide. But now suppose that our man is informed by his doctor that he can have a drink without endangering his health. He exclaims with pleasure, says that he will have a drink later but in fact does not do so. Did he really wish that he could have a drink when he thought he could not have one ? The answer is almost as it was before but now the truth and even the truthfulness of the wish are threatened not only by its incongruity with his past desires but also by how he behaves and hence his desires subsequent to his getting the new in- formation. What adds to our doubts in this case is that believing that he cannot have a drink seems not only sufficient but necessary-after an understandable lag-for his professing to want one. We have here a limiting case. So far I have considered attempts to undermine idle wishes, i.e., attempts to show that there are cases in which a man does not really wish that . . . despite the fact that he says that he wishes idly that . . . and insists on this. But if what a man is disposed to say has the r61e I ascribe to it, does it not follow that a man cannot be said to idly wish for</page><page sequence="11">HOPING AND WISHING 61 something unless he says so, or would say so if asked, and is this not false ? It does follow and it is usually correct. Suppose that a young man who loves playing football has lost a leg in a motor cycle accident. We visit him in hospital and ask him, "Don't you wish you hadn't lost that leg?" He might simply deny this, but if this is because he does not wish to reveal how he feels the thesis is not threatened. An interesting test is provided by his sincerely denying that he wishes he had not lost his leg, for if this happens are we not inclined to say that though--or even if-he means what he says, it is not true ? Once again there is a dilemma and again the difficulty for the thesis is caused by an incongruity between what in this example the young man professes not to idly wish and what he used to desire. But this time what he used to desire is of such a sort that we feel sure he must still desire it. If we accept what he says, we accept that his desire to play football, to be able to play football and so to be a whole man has been cut off along with his leg, and we are, naturally, reluctant to believe that this can have happened. If we are prepared to believe that this happened, we want an explanation of why or how it has happened. If none is forthcoming, we are strongly inclined to say that, no matter what the young man says-even to himself, in his heart-he must really wish that he had not lost his leg. But what can this mean? And how could this view be corroborated ? What it means is that if the young man could be brought to face and accept the truth about himself he would say that he wanted his leg back. However, even if he cannot be brought to admit this, we may continue to believe that the wish is there but buried, and we regard other things that he might say or do as indicating the existence of this wish which he would avow if he were not so resistant. Suppose, for example, that he is vehement or even hysterical in his denials of the wish we impute to him? We know that such vehemence often signals an inner conflict if only because it so often presages a subsequent acceptance of what was previously denied. We anticipate the young man's saying something of this sort, "Yes I wish-and did wish even when I denied it-that I had my leg. But I couldn't live with that thought. It was too much. I think</page><page sequence="12">62 COLIN RADFORD I must have persuaded myself that . . . ". But even if he does not break down in this way, we may notice that, though normally cheerful, he gets very irritable when he watches his fellow convalescents kicking a ball about on the grass outside the ward. Irritability in such a situation is a sign of jealousy and envy and will no doubt be construed as such. So in this and similar cases, what is thought to be natural and inevitable, viz., that the disavowed desire will continue to exist, is postulated; what can be construed as the natural accompaniment, expression or consequence of such a wish is so construed; and these considerations are preferred as in- dicating what the subject really wishes to what he actually and "sincerely" says or would say if asked. The thesis, then, that being disposed to express an idle wish is constitutive of idle wishing collapses under the weight of certain cases of unconscious wishing. Nonetheless, idle wishing is, e.g., more like a man's believing that he has acted in cowardly fashion than his actually having done so. For whether he actually did so is quite independent of what he may say, but whether he believes he acted in this way or not-even though there may be cases in which at some level a man does believe this and yet sincerely denies that he does. And even in these cases, because what a man sincerely says is so central to the belief, our judgment that he does believe that he acted in cowardly fashion commits us to the view that he is disposed to say that he has been a coward but some resistance prevents his recognising and admitting this. The thesis can also collapse in states or conditions that involve idle wishing but which being massive or intense, also have a large behavioural component; and because there are such states it will not do to say simply that idle wishing is less behavioural than hoping (see p. 57). Consider grief, shame, remorse, embarrassment, dread, terror, etc. All either charac- teristically or at least frequently involve idle wishing, i.e., a person's recognising that something has happened or will happen and his wanting it not to have happened or to happen. But being the sorts of states they are, they necessarily involve more than the mere recognition or avowal of hopeless desires. But now suppose that the behaviour and the wish seem to come apart. A woman, having just heard of her husband's</page><page sequence="13">HOPING AND WISHING 63 death, sobs and yet, very strangely, denies that she wishes that he had not been killed. Her doing this would be intelligible if, say, they had been estranged. For in that case we would say, "She is deceiving herself. She cannot bring herself to admit her feelings but they show themselves." Here is another case in which we treat a person's behaviour as providing better evidence for, and a more convincing expression of, what she really wishes than what she is disposed, however sincerely, to say. Of course, there are other possibilities. The woman may be lying, but that is of no interest since the wish is there and recognised. Suppose, however, that the woman's husband was dying anyway so that she had been expecting his death and felt that the accident was a happy one, relieving him of more suffering ? Here, despite the distress and tears there may be no wish that the man had not been killed in the accident. But there must, I think, be another idle wish for the response to be intelligible as distress, viz., the wish that her husband had not been ill as he was, or a wish that he could have been well and still with her. Such feelings, yearnings, are focused and finally condemned as hopeless by the news of the accident. In the preceding account I say that in most cases, a man idly wishes if he expresses a wish that he believes unattainable, or would do so if prepared to reveal his wish, and means it. But what is the criterion of his meaning it? It cannot simply be his insisting on it, since he might do this insincerely. It cannot be his reiterating the wish, for a wish can be transient. It cannot be his tone of voice, since he may be a good actor or, conversely, he may say lightly things he means. It cannot be how he behaves, since he might control his responses. It cannot be what he does to get what he desires, because he believes that there is nothing he can do to achieve this. It cannot, in most cases, be what he used to do and like because his desires may have changed. It cannot be what he does after hearing say that his idle wish can, after all, be satisfied, for the same reason. But all the things just mentioned do have a bearing on determining whether a man is sincere, and the bearing they have varies from case to case. Indeed, their relevance is such that in odd cases these things and other aspects of a man's behaviour may persuade us that he does not mean what he</page><page sequence="14">64 COLIN RADFORD says, though he believes that he does, and we can also imagine the contrary. The things mentioned then, are not contingently connected with sincerity. They can be missing in sincere cases and be present in insincere ones, but we cannot imagine these things and sincerity generally coming apart. Since a man hoping for something believes that he may get what he desires, hoping is more behavioural than wishing in that-in certain cases anyway-a man who hopes can do things which make it more likely that he will get what he eo ipso desires. As trying to get something is a criterion both of wanting qua desiring it and believing that it can be got, behaviour that makes what the actor hopes for more likely is not just expressive of his hope but logically and indeed ration- ally connected with it and constitutive of it. So there can be relatively unproblematic cases of hoping in which the hoper has neither said out loud nor to himself, "I hope... ", nor is disposed to do so and, conversely, cases in which a man says, "I hope that ... " where we easily discount this signal, treating what he says as insincere or false, i.e., as revealing a lack of self-knowledge. But though the connexion between hoping and action is direct it is not simple. Indeed in some cases there is no behaviour that could be constitutive of the hope in the way described above because either there is nothing that the wisher can do to try to bring about what he hopes for and he is aware of this, or there is but he believes unproblematically that there is nothing that he can do. In other cases the direct connexion between hoping and behaviour is complicated by two further phenomena, viz., that men usually have more than one hope and hopes can be competitors; and, secondly, that hopes have two components, a desire for something and some measure of confidence that what is desired can be had, and these components can vary independently of each other. Moreover, a man can try to do something without believing that he can do it. A poor darts player may be set the task of getting two treble twenties and a double top to win a game. He may concede the game but it is much more likely and sporting that he will throw his darts, trying to get what he needs to win though quite sure that he has no hope of doing so. The fact that he does try to do this does not entail that he</page><page sequence="15">HOPING AND WISHING 65 believes that he can do it and so does not entail that he hopes to do it. But to return to the possibly more interesting complications; a man may do nothing to achieve some end because, though not certain, he is confident of getting what he wants without his doing anything. His failure to act is a measure of his confidence, it does not impugn the existence of his desire. At most it implies that the desire could be stronger, or that it is not his only desire, or that it is not the strongest of his desires. The converse case is more difficult to imagine. This is one in which a man does nothing to achieve some end because, though not certain, he is confident that he will not get what he wants, even if he were to do whatever he might do that could help to give him what he wants. Other things being equal his failure to act indicates not only lack of confidence but low desire, i.e., not only does he not have much hope but he does not apparently hope very much that. . . . But other things may not be equal, so that failure to act is not a direct measure of low desire but reflects his decision to direct his actions towards achieving other ends which he believes are more attainable. Men can also have competing hopes. Such hopes do not always and immediately destroy each other but realising one threatens the realisation of the other. Suppose, for example, that a squash player has a damaged racquet arm. He hopes to win his college championship, but believes that to do this he should get match practice. He also hopes that his arm will get better, but believes that for this the arm needs rest. He may practise, in the hope of winning the championship, without losing hope of his arm's getting better, provided, of course, that he has some confidence of his arm's improving despite the exercise. Conversely, he may rest the arm, in the hope that it will have fully recovered by the time the competition starts, without losing hope of the championship if he believes that he might still win the championship with a good arm despite the lack of practice. But if he believes that he cannot win without practice and that his arm will not recover with practice, he cannot hope both for his arm to get better and to win the championship. Here the competing hopes are incompatible, i.e., he cannot really hope for both. In any other situation he</page><page sequence="16">66 COLIN RADFORD can hope for both. But what he does, viz., whether he practises or not, cannot by itself provide a relative measure of both the degree of confidence and the intensity of the desire which together constitute each hope. So in this sort of situation we could not infer from his not practising that he wants his arm to recover more than he wants to win the championship, and we could not infer from his playing that he wants to win the championship more than he wants his arm to recover. Similarly, we can make no inferences simply from his behaviour that he has more confidence of his arm's getting better than of winning the championship, or vice versa. To think that one can is like thinking that one can solve an equation with two variables given just one equation. Having looked at so many problematic cases, it is corrective to look at a non-problematic case of hoping. The average third-year university student hopes to get a degree. He will by that stage of his career believe that he can get a degree but not be certain of this, and his steadily working away also indicates that he wants to get his degree. So he hopes to get a degree, even if he does not say this or anything that entails this; it goes without saying-and it would simply be mis- chievous of his tutor to ask him, "Do you hope to get a degree ?", Is there any behaviour constitutive of hoping other than that already mentioned? Being disappointed is an obvious candidate. A man who does not get what he hopes for must be disappointed if only in the sense that he does not get it. But if on hearing his bad news he does not express disappointment, does not behave in a disappointed fashion, either in words or facially or bodily, there must be some explanation of why he does not do this. The possible explanations are many. The man may be stoical, or he may inhibit his response to the particular bad news for some particular reason, or his bad news may be accompanied by some good news, or he may be buoyed up by the promising development of other projects, etc. And if a man on getting some news, e.g., that he has not got a certain job, does not feel disappointment but, say, relief, he is likely to say, "I couldn't really have wanted that job after all". But he, and we, may accept a friend's remark that he had been</page><page sequence="17">HOPING AND WISHING 67 in two minds about it, or worried about it, etc., and then he might feel disappointment. In some situations where we feel disappointment and relief-perhaps in that order-this may be because we had undoubtedly hoped for whatever it was but it would have made heavy demands on us had we got it, so that, after our initial disappointment, we are relieved at not having to face the prospects of those demands any more. But as the example shows, we say-and not always disingenuously-that we had not or could not really have hoped for something, after learning that we are not going to get it, on more occasions than this is strictly true. On such occasions we deceive ourselves about what our hopes have been, not only to neutralise the first-order unhappiness of disappointment but also, possibly, to avoid the second-order unhappiness of being the sort of person who does not get the things he hopes for. We are unhappy to see ourselves or to be seen as either unfortunate or unrealistic or greedy. How we distinguish these cases of self-delusion from those where we really had not hoped can be a nice matter. Where it is so nice as to be unanswerable, i.e., where we cannot say whether a man who sincerely disavows having hoped for something that did not materialise is correct or mistaken, the right answer to our puzzle is that neither answer is correct. The realistic supposition that he must either have hoped that ... or not hoped that ... is false. So if there is behaviour constitutive of disappointment, a specimen of this behaviour is constitutive not of a hope or hoping but of the past existence of a hope which has become an idle wish. There is a qualification that must be made to this. It is that disappointment is experienced not only when hopes are dashed but, a fortiori, when a man does not get something he desires which he thought he knew that he would get. Disappointment is not peculiar to or, as we say, sufficient for dashed hopes, and it is likely to occur in its most acute forms when what we have taken to be certainties fail us. But this does not mean that there are not cases such as the following; a man, having sincerely disavowed hoping for promotion because he realised that his chances of getting it were virtually nil,4 admits, after hearing that he has not got his promotion, that he must have been</page><page sequence="18">68 COLIN RADFORD hoping after all since the only explanation he can give of his present depression is that it is disappointment. He might be wrong about this, but he may also be right.5 If disappointment is sometimes constitutive of the past existence of a hope, so, by parity of reasoning, is whatever greets the fulfilment or realisation of a hope. But certain characteristic sorts of behaviour only constitute relief, delight, elation, etc., in certain contexts and, of course, just as we can be disappointed when a "certainty" lets us down so we can be overjoyed on getting news which initially we could scarcely believe because we thought we had no hope that what we so much wanted to happen might come to pass. Besides such responses, our hopes can be enmeshed in our lives and so indicated by our plans, i.e., by our schemes and projects and the preparations which we make for them. Moreover, although, e.g., we can do nothing about the weather tomorrow, the plans we make to play tennis then and our marking out the court indicate not only that we hope to play tennis tomorrow, which we can try to arrange, but also that we hope that it will be fine, which at present we cannot try to arrange. But there could be no behaviour analogous to our marking out the court, if our twin hopes were idle wishes. Instead of action we might have recrimination or regret, which are much more verbal than what accompanies and indicates either hope. Of course, there are hopes which are indicated-and which, in certain circumstances, could only be indicated-by what we say, and there are idle wishes indicated almost entirely by what we do. A man might go through with his marking out the tennis court even after having heard that tomorrow's game is off. Being unimaginative or inflexible he may be unable to think of doing anything else, or he may get a certain melancholy or even masochistic pleasure from doing it. Certainly, though, his action requires some such explanation, and it does not stand to or indicate his idle wishes as it would stand to and indicate his hopes. Generally, and necessarily, idle wishes are more linguistic and less behavioural than hopes. But now to return to the problem shelved earlier. If idle wishing were simply constituted by saying, "I wish I could ... (that he had ... etc.)", then, as hoping is a state whose existence</page><page sequence="19">HOPING AND WISHING 69 may be indicated by various behaviour not all of which is linguistic, no further explanation would be required of why it is that wishing words are sometimes used to refer to linguistic and mental events and hoping words are not. But there are difficulties with this explanation of the difference in usage. For idle wishing is not just saying something out loud or to oneself, and meaning it, since, like hoping, it is something continuous, a state. But though to wish idly is to be in a certain state, the state is chiefly one in which we have a propensity to say or think things of a certain sort, so that the behaviour that normally and mainly constitutes wishing is saying something, if not out loud then to oneself. Even so, this propensity is suppressed in some cases and in others replaced by, e.g., a tendency to sigh, or to stare out of the window at the rain, etc. There is, moreover, another difficulty with the explanation which is that when wishes are events or episodes they are cases of saying. Now these events are never themselves idle even though the wishes they express or convey are sometimes idle. Yet they are not preponderantly so. Indeed, when one is invited or commanded, "Wish!", or when one avails oneself of an auspicious occasion on which to do this, the wish then expressed is usually not an idle one, even if it might be idle if it were expressed on another, less auspicious occasion. And even when we are asked what our wishes are or what we wish for, this is not always an invitation to reveal our hopeless yearnings. It can be a humble request-"What is your wish, sire ?"-for an imperious wish, which is a command. And non-idle wishes, being realisable wants qua desires, are as continuous and non-linguistic as hopes, for they include hopes. [A third section of this paper, which provides a test case for its main thesis, has appeared under the title, "Hoping, Wishing and Dogs" in Inquiry, Spring, 1970.]</page><page sequence="20">70 COLIN RADFORD REFERENCES 1 But see Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Ia, IIac, 3o, 2 ad I, and A. Kenny, Action, Emotion and The Will, pp. I 15-6, who provides my information about Aquinas. 2 Idle wishes in the ordinary sense are transient, half-hearted wishes which are often but not always idle in my technical sense. 3 Mischievous because it implies that this is in question, and it is not. 4 Presumably such a man is either so constituted that he just does not want whatever he believes he is unlikely to get, or his rationality is willed, i.e., he does not allow himself to want what he thinks he has little or no chance of having. But how can that be willed? Desire is not subject to the will. But we can control our desires indirectly. E.g., a married man might take care to avoid meeting a girl who attracts him and, as a result, his desire for her may wither. - But how could he be wrong? Well, we might discover a physiological basis for his depression. Women frequently and regularly experience depression of this sort. But even if there is such a causal explanation, is the man wrong if he insists, nonetheless, that it was not getting the job which depressed him ? Is it not the case that the man's not getting the job becomes the target for his depression ? Perhaps so, but don't we sometimes speak of rationalization here? And even if we accept that the man is depressed because he did not get the promotion, it does not follow that we must accept his description of his depression as disappointment. For to do so is to accept a claim that is not only about what he feels now but one which also has implications both for how he felt earlier and the connexion between these two states.</page><page sequence="21">HOPING AND WISHING by Colin Radford and J. M. Hinton II J. M. Hinton I shall not reproduce the structure of Mr. Radford's interesting paper, but will simply pick out certain points for comment and development. Most of the development concerns the class of wants, desires, to which Radford thinks, and I agree, that hopes and wishes belong. WISHING AND IDLENESS Radford says that wishing is most itself when idle. I should like to defend wishing against this bad report, in a back- handed way. Wishing is, I think, most itself when inactive, but not most itself when idle in Radford's sense of the word, in which an idle wish is one "whose object is somehow seen by the wisher as impossible of achievement". That is surely as much as to say that if the wisher himself were to describe the wish, he would describe it as in vain, or hopeless. Radford contrasts this, his own technical sense of the phrase "an idle wish", with the ordinary sense; which he takes to be, a transient or half-hearted wish. As will become clear, I doubt whether "transient or half-hearted" is exact, as an account of the ordinary sense of "idle" here, but in any case I want to concentrate first on what I am calling inactive wishes. I simply mean, wishes or desires where, for one reason or another, the subject has no real intention of "doing anything about it", as we say. These include, of course, many desires that are idle in Radford's sense. But what does it mean, to say that (non-episodic) wishing is most itself when of this or that sort, say idle ? I take it to mean this; that when, in English, referring to a state as distinct 7'</page><page sequence="22">72 J. M. HINTON from an event, we use the verb, "to wish", and when we are using this verb in order to be quite specific, i.e., when it would not be true to say that we might just as well have used, say, the verb "to hope" or the verb "to want", or that we might just as well have done so but for such considerations as tact, self-respect and politeness; then, usually at least, the desire or want we are referring to is being asserted to be of the sort in question-say, idle. (I feel forced to see the thesis as one about English because it does not seem to me that, for instance, the distinction in French between "vouloir" and "souhaiter" comes in quite the same place as our distinction between wanting and wishing, such as it is.) As I have implied, I am inclined to think that this thesis would be right enough in terms of "inactive", in the sense explained above, but that it is wrong in terms of Radford's own sense of "idle". I do not see anything untypical for a "wish" about my inactive, but not in Radford's sense idle, wish that somebody would shut the door-where it is not that I cannot, but that I cannot be bothered. As for the fact that, if "wish" in its non-episodic use is proper to inactive desire rather than to idleness in Radford's sense, then the classes of hopes and paradigmatic "wishes" overlap; I would count this as a minor virtue of the view, rather than as an awkward- ness. The remark, "I wish, and indeed I hope ... ", need not, I feel, be suspected of being either a less perspicuous form of "I desire, and indeed I hope . . . " or a less perspicuous form of "I wish-no, let me take that back-I hope .... " If desires that get called wishes otherwise than by courtesy are typically inactive, then it is not hard to see why other desires get called wishes by courtesy. Everything falls into place, and finds itself explained on familiar, central principles. Not only have speakers not wanted even to appear to suggest that the person referred to might be in want, needy; they have positively wanted to suggest that he was one who need not exert himself in order to procure the fulfilment of his desires. He need only express them, because his wish is his servant's command. In an uncorrupted Franciscan or communist society, his want might simply be his brother's want. Radford himself points out that the question, "What is your wish ?" is deferential, unlike "What do you want ?"; but this fact would</page><page sequence="23">HOPING AND WISHING 73 be rather mysterious if wishes were typically for objects which the wisher saw as unattainable. The fact that the communicative and reportive expression of an inactive desire by someone who is in a position of authority is an implicit command or request; this fact, to which Radford alludes, may perhaps also help us to explain something which he would like to see explained: the fact that the word "wishing" in English has come to be the name for what is sometimes done in the solitary, including the mental, verbal expression of a wish. The word "wishing", here, or the phrase "making a wish", can be thought of as the suitably guarded description of an (exercitive illocutionary) act, the poor man's implicit commanding. The verb, "to wish", to make a wish, is the verb, "to command or request implicitly in expressing an inactive desire", played in the minor key. The guarded description of the act re-uses the verb most suitable in its performance, since an expression of hope would be either presumptuous or insufficiently sceptical in this r6le. This view, that episodic wishing is an illocutionary act, fits in with the way we feel about the unfortunate woman in the fairy story, who was allowed the privilege of three wishes and who frittered them all away by inadvertently saying, "Oh, (how) I wish ...!" three times about trivial or absurd things, which duly came true. It was unfair, we feel. She did not really wish, make a wish, at all; there is more to making a wish than that. In this light it is tempting to equate idle wishing, not with a kind of making-a-wish, but on the contrary with certain special cases of what the luckless woman did; cases-marked out perhaps as expressions of evanescent, half-hearted or un- important desires-of not really, but only apparently, making a wish; where some condition necessary for the verbal ex- pression to embody the illocutionary act is not satisfied. The subject is not even pretending to half-expect to be heard and obeyed, perhaps. On this view, although wishing is often the state of desiring, idle wishing is always and only a linguistic episode, a kind of idle thought. I do not think this exactly characterises ordinary usage, because I think we do say things like "In those days I had the entirely idle wish . . . ", meaning a desire; one that was idle in something like Radford's sense. Still this was hardly "idly wishing"; I think that the lightly</page><page sequence="24">74 J. M. HINTON stressed adverbial form is kept pretty well to the verbal oc- currence. One might see "idly wondering" as a case of this, idly wishing to know. (As often happens, I fear I may have read this Austin-like account of episodic wishing and idly wishing, somewhere; I cannot find it in Austin.) HOPING, WISHING AND TALKING "Generally and necessarily, hoping is less linguistic than idle wishing." Would it be fair to paraphrase this thesis of Radford's as: "Generally and necessarily, desiring something you see as unattainable is more linguistic than hoping for something?" I should have thought the paraphrase would be fair, because it seems as if "idle wishing" in Radford's sense was simply defined as desiring something you see as unattainable. An alternative interpretation would be, that an idle wish in Radford's sense is a desire of that hopeless sort which moreover is a wish in some further sense. But I am not sure what, for Radford, this further sense would be. If wishes are rather intellectual things, then Radford's thesis tends to become true afortiori, simply because a wish-idle or not-is more linguistic than a hope need be. On the other hand if the above paraphrase of Radford's thesis is fair, then the thesis strikes me as dubious. I cannot help wondering whether it gets some unearned plausibility from the ordinary meaning and associations of the phrase, "idly wishing". Another thing with which Radford's thesis might be confused is, the near-truism that hoping is less linguistic than wishing when wishing is not only idle in Radford's sense, but also is viewed by the subject as that sort of wishing. This would be true just because language is needed in order to view oneself and one's mental states as falling under descriptions. It would be unfair to contrast wishing in which one saw oneself as wishing, with hoping in which one did not see oneself as hoping. Radford's argument for this thesis concerns avowals and disavowals. He thinks, if I have not misunderstood, that these play a more important r6le when we are trying to decide whether someone desires something which he sees as</page><page sequence="25">HOPING AND WISHING 75 unattainable, than they do when we are trying to decide whether a man hopes for something. This, however, might be literally true without being true for that reason. It might be because so many desires of that sort are for what might have been, or even for what could by no manner of means have been- special, and specially linguistic, cases. Surely we are not necessarily or typically more dependent on avowals in detecting a case of hopelessly unrequited love, than in a case where the lover has hopes ? By the way, certain expressions of Radford's could be read as meaning that observable conditions can logically entail sincerity, and that the occurrence of sincere avowals can logically entail the presence of the desire avowed: I would not agree with the first of those things, nor with the second unless it was trivialised. In sum then, and in spite of the interest of Radford's dis- cussion and examples, I still need to be convinced that desires for things which you see as unattainable are as such more linguistic than hopeful desires. And this would make it hard for me to admit that inactive desires as such were especially linguistic. On the other hand the thesis-quite apart from being trivially true of "idly wishing", the linguistic performance- may well be true of idle or entirely idle wishes or desires not in Radford's sense but in D. M. Armstrong's. These are wishes or desires where, as we say, the subject would not even if he could-"velleities", wishes only in so general a sense that they lack the substance of a real wish. They tend towards a mere disposition to the linguistic performance. This last remark may give the impression that I think real human desires are not at all "linguistic". If so, the impression is misleading. I only find it hard to see a sense in which the particular species of human desire which Radford has singled out for attention in this context is any more linguistic than the rest of the genus. I think most human desires are in a sense pretty linguistic, that avowals and disavowals play a vital role in their manifestation, because people can and do desire many things which are of such kinds that the observer needs avowals and disavowals in order to be sure what the other signs-say, signs of joy and distress-are about. I see, of course, that if a man desires something he believes</page><page sequence="26">76 J. M. HINTON to be unattainable, then as a general rule, though as Radford admits not always, the man will refrain from trying to disprove his own belief, so that certain non-linguistic indications of the desire will be lacking. And it may be in a sense necessary that people do not generally try to disprove their own beliefs as to the impossibility of getting what they want, since striving for something is a sign of thinking that it is achievable. But I should be unhappy about stepping from this to the conclusion that, necessarily and generally, hoping has more non-linguistic behavioural manifestations than hopeless desire. For as Radford himself points out, hope can be without striving, and I do not know how to balance the amount of inactive hope which the world could contain against the amount which it could contain of active though hopeless desire. Even if this balance could be struck, and struck in such a way that we found there had to be less of the former commodity than the latter, I should still be unhappy, for reasons I have tried to indicate, about saying on this ground that hoping was less linguistic than hopeless wishing. In a pleasant final section of his paper which had to be sacrificed to the word limit, Radford tested the thesis that what he calls idle wishing is more linguistic than hoping, by asking whether a dog can less absurdly be said to hope than to have in Radford's sense, an idle wish. The ordinary meaning and associations of "idly wishing" do, in one way or another, make it perceptibly more absurd to speak of a dog as idly wishing than to speak of him as hoping. But I think that if you are prepared to describe, say, a dog's behaviour, as he is ferried across a river to where he wants to be, as evincing steadily increasing hope, until he jumps out and swims the last few yards; then you might just as well describe his previous behaviour on the other bank, with no means of crossing in sight that he could recognise, as evincing a desire for something he saw as unattainable. A DOUBTFUL CERTAINTY OR TWO Next, some comments on a remark of Radford's which I found very interesting, though I do not know whether for him it is</page><page sequence="27">HOPING AND WISHING 77 central or peripheral. It is hardly one that is bound to be peripheral. Radford describes a case in which, at least for the time being, we cannot say whether or not someone hoped that p; and he says that "the realistic supposition", that the man must either have hoped that p or not have hoped that p, is in this case false. The word "realistic", in this context, suggests an allusion to the views of Michael Dummett (recently ex- pounded in "The Reality of the Past", P.A.S., 1968-69). Unfortunately I still have some questions in my mind as to what realism and anti-realism in this sense involve and are involved by; so I think I must bypass the adjective and merely discuss whether what Radford calls "the realistic supposition" is indeed false. For much the same reason I shall follow Radford's example by not using the phrase, "the law of excluded middle". The question is, what should we think of someone who hears Radford describe his case and then says: "Well, one thing is certain at any rate. Either the man hoped that p, or he did not". We can surely think well of such a one and his certitude if he explains that by "either-or" he means "vel", and that he accepts the Law of Double Negation and de Morgan's Laws as applying; since in that case what he is calling certain is logically equivalent to an instance of the Law of Non-Contradiction. If he tells us that he does not mean "vel", or that he does not accept both the Law of Double Negation and de Morgan's Laws as applying to what he is calling certain-then I feel that he tells us only what it is not, that he is calling certain. What is it ? It just might be this: that only ignorance prevents us from deciding whether the man hoped that p or not. An odd thing to mean by "Either he hoped that p or he did not", but not an altogether im- possible thing to mean by it, since a tacit prefix, "It is ascertainable given ideal fact-finding procedures that . . ", might slip in unnoticed before each of the disjuncts. If that is what Radford's antagonist is calling certain; if he is calling it certain that only ignorance prevents us from deciding whether the man hoped that p or not; then many of us will side with Radford because we know, or think we know, that there are what have been called "cases for decision or cheerful</page><page sequence="28">78 J. M. HINTON indecision, according to whether there is any point in deciding the issue". These are cases in which it is precisely not a matter of ascertaining whether, for instance, Fx, but of either shrugging your shoulders or else deciding whether to call such a thing as x is, F. The situation arises because "our concepts are not at every point bounded by rules"-so that we sometimes have to decide what the rule is to be, or else decide that we need make no such decision. Someone who, without giving any reason for his assertion, called it certain that the case Radford describes was not a case of that sort, would be making it hard for us to agree with him. On the other hand the same might be true of one who called it certain that the case was a case of that sort; he too would be going beyond his brief. And although I would not claim to know about this, he might be going beyond Wittgenstein; at any rate there is a good deal of retouching in-"An 'inner' process stands in need of none but common-observational criteria". I mean that if a philosopher offered a definition of such and such a mental state, from which definition it would follow that only ignorance prevents us from deciding an issue which we might otherwise have regarded as belonging to the other sort, then it would be wrong to reject his definition on this ground alone. WANTING A man can want what he has. Surely there is no mistake in this way of speaking which Radford favours. Equally, however, I think there is no mistake in the other way of speaking, the one in which "having" excludes "wanting". This way of speaking is even, in a sense, the more analytical of the two-as is inevitable when someone who can give all the information I can give, uses some verb more restrictedly than I use it. I find out what I mean by "Fx" by finding out what he says when I say "Fx" and he does not. Radford's, or our modern, way of speaking has the virtue of bringing out the fact that a man who has wanted something can still be of the same mind when he gets it. The same name for the "same mind" that he then is of, and might not have been of, is natural and permissible.</page><page sequence="29">HOPING AND WISHING 79 Yet it does tend to obscure the distinctive character of "wanting" when one has what one "wants". One's "wanting" then consists in one's (being so minded that) one sees the thing as a sort of asset-here I want to leave open two questions which I think ordinary language leaves open, whether the bracketed words are superfluous and if not why not. I shall sometimes omit them, without prejudice. That is the point, that wanting what you have is radically different from other kinds of wanting, since it consists in your seeing what you have as an asset. But before returning to this point, four things should be said about the notions which have just been used. (i) To count something as an asset, to have wanted some- thing, and to want to keep it-those three things are independent of one another, and this is why Radford is right to deny that all the work can be done by the last two of them. The independence of the triad is obscured by the fact that we generally, and perhaps necessarily generally, both count as an asset and want to keep a thing we wanted to get; so that "getting what you wanted" is a natural idiom for getting what you then and there count as a new asset, or count it as a gain that you have got. (ii) Counting it as a gain that you have acquired a thing, and counting a thing as an asset; these are special, without being in my view specially important, cases of "counting it as a plus", or seeing it as good from your personal point of view, that something is the case-what is the case there, of course, is that you have, or that you have acquired, the thing. You see it as good that p, in this sense, when your state of mind on that particular score is the one expressed by "Good!"; "Good that p!" Such uses of the word "good", in the ex- clamation "Good!" and other expressions of pro tanto satis- faction, are neither predicative nor attributive: neither the question, "The thing is good in what sense ?", nor the question, "A good what?", is applicable. The speaker was just expressing his personal satisfaction. (iii) I talk about "counting it as a plus that p" or "seeing it as good-from one's personal point of view-that p" because the more natural locution, "being glad", even in the pointed form of "being glad that p", seems difficult to confine to a</page><page sequence="30">80 J. M. HINTON pro tanto sense, difficult to detach from an all-in reckoning. I might have occasion to say, "I wanted him to stay alive, and I want him to be alive, as he is; but in view of what he did to stay alive, I cannot quite bring myself to say that I am glad that he is alive"-where nevertheless I count it as a plus that he is alive, or see this as something which in itself is good from my personal point of view. Similarly with "sorry". (iv) Some may reject the thesis that, so to speak, "satisfied desire is simply satisfaction", as not just verbally but logically circular; on the ground that satisfaction, or counting it as a plus that p, must be defined as something like-"knowing that p, where one desires that p". It surely becomes clear on reflection that, at best, these objectors merely undertake to provide some better account of desire than the one of which the thesis they reject is an instalment. Otherwise they are only counter-proposing that modern general "wanting", rather than "counting something as a plus", be left undefined for the time being. Why ? The greater generality of the former notion speaks against the proposal prima facie. A man's apparently seeing it as good that p, and his indeed seeing it as good that p; the point is that these seem odd things for us to be respectively basing ourselves on and committing ourselves to, in attributing a want. Yet I do not see what else can be involved when we say of a man that he wants something to be the case which he knows to be the case-not meaning that he wanted it to be the case, or that he wants it to remain so. The other way of speaking-the terminology of Aquinas- helps us to see this peculiar character of satisfied wanting, the radical difference between satisfied and unsatisfied wanting; but it does so at the price of obscuring the fact which Radford's way of speaking brings out, that a man who has wanted something may still be of the same mind when he gets it. The Thomist way of speaking even makes it seem, at first sight, almost as if we could say, "He wanted the thing, but now he has had a complete change of heart or mind-he has the thing, and is glad that he has it." Yet the Thomist way of speaking does not really entail our saying anything so absurd. It allows us to say, "A man who has wanted something, and who now has it, is of the same mind if-and indeed only if-he is so minded that he counts it as a gain that he has got the</page><page sequence="31">HOPING AND WISHING 81 thing." True, it had better allow us to say so, but then once more it does. The same name for the "mind he is still of" is not obligatory. And those who favour a restrictive use of "want" can surely clear themselves in more than one way of Radford's charge, that they confuse "to want, desire" with "to lack, be without". One way, if they do not mind being very restrictive, is for them to define their verb, "to want, desire, lack that p", as "to see it as bad that, as you think, not p". (True, Radford's Thomas or Thomist cannot do this. He speaks of wanting to keep a thing, and this is hardly a case of seeing it as bad that not p-or of seeing it as good that p, for that matter.) They-these perhaps imaginary restrictionists-will use that verb when they can; and on some of the remaining occasions when we say "he wants", they can speak of someone as seeing it as good that, as he thinks, p. But then what do they say of someone when we say of him that he wants that p, but that he has no belief as to whether p ? (I do not mean that this is the only case in which we want to know what they say.) Let us consider someone who, at a certain time, "wants" something to be happening at that very time, without having any belief as to whether it is happening or not. The description of this as a case of wanting would be ruled out, not only by the above definition in terms of "bad", but also by two in- compatible doctrines: the ultra-restrictive, and perhaps merely absurd, doctrine that a man cannot want something to be the case which is the case, not even if he is quite unaware that it is the case; and the doctrine, which might be suggested by our own analysis hitherto, that someone can want "that which is", but only when he "has" it or knows it to be the case-in fact, only when his "wanting" it can consist in his seeing it as good that the thing is, as he thinks, so. The rejection of the above-mentioned case of a man's wanting something simultaneous, gets some plausibility from the slightly suspicious emphasis with which we say "I want her to be opening her present . .. . " or " . . . to be thinking of me at this very moment"-in that far off place, just as we arranged. The more usual, unremarkable thing to say would be, "I hope she is opening her present". And, of one who said this, we might well hesitate to say that he thought or</page><page sequence="32">82 J. M. HINTON believed that she was opening her present. Taken together, these facts threaten both parts of the view, which Radford shares with, for instance, D. M. Armstrong, that hoping is wanting that p while believing uncertainly that p. We shall avert the threat, however, at least as far as bringing hope under the heading of desire is concerned, if we can explain in what sense the man "wants" his wife or girl to be opening her present or thinking of him. I think he does satisfy conditions which are sufficient for "wanting" this, in a natural sense. For a start, his state of mind is such that if he learns or comes to believe that she did indeed open her present or think of him at that time, then he will see this as something good in itself from his personal point of view-unless, of course, he is then no longer of the same mind he is of, now. And if he learns or come to believe that she did not do that thing at that time, then his state of mind on that particular score will be the one expressed by "Bad!"-unless, of course, he is then no longer of that same mind he is of, now. I call this a "start" because I do not think we have yet mentioned a sufficient condition for wanting that p. What we have mentioned is something like-"being predisposed to welcome the news or idea that p, and to find the idea or information that not p unwelcome". I would think that this was a necessary condition for wanting that p, except in cases where all talk of the subject's believing or knowing that p was out of place. (In such cases, if there are such cases, I suppose the condition of knowing or believing that p usually collapses into the condition that p; though not in the case of wishing that you were dead, which reduces itself to seeing it as bad that you are alive.) Even in what is proposed merely as a defeasible requirement for wanting that p, the qualification above-" . . . unless, of course, he is then no longer of that same mind"-may cause uneasiness. But should it? It is not, of course, superfluous, since without it the condition would not be a requirement of any sort for the subject's now wanting that p. Nor does the qualification make the whole condition vacuous, since the whole condition fails to be satisfied by one who, for instance, comes to think that not p without seeing it as bad that not p, and without any change of heart or mind. Nor does the</page><page sequence="33">HOPING AND WISHING 83 condition have the possibly objectionable characteristic of requiring, for something's now being the case, that a second thing will be the case if a third thing is the case. It requires, for someone's now X-ing (wanting that p) that he be now in a state of mind such that, if he will be in that state of mind and will Y (know or believe that p) then he will Z (see it as good that p). This avoids using a conditional whose apodosis is known, by the one who asserts the conditional, to be false. There is a tenseless alternative: to require, for one's X-ing, one's being in a state of mind such that anyone who is in that state of mind and who Y's, Z's. Then "He is X-ing" comes out as requiring "He is in a state of mind such that anyone who is in it and T's, Z's", (3') (Ya . (x) ((WYx . Rx)---+Zx)) -not as requiring "He, if he Y's, Z's" or "He, if he were r-ing, would be Z-ing" or anything like that. Coming back to the man who "wants" the woman to be opening her present: not only does he satisfy the condition we have just mentioned, but also he satisfies a further condition. He believes that if he immediately, at once, in the immediate future, learns that the woman is opening her present, then he will see this as good, and that if he immediately learns that she is not doing so, then he will see this as bad. Putting this and the previous condition together, we surely have a sufficient condition for saying, in a good sense, that he wants her to be opening her present; even without adding, what would pro- bably also be true, that he is in a state of mind such that anyone who is in that state of mind and thinks he can do something conducive to that woman's opening her present at the relevant time, does so. Another way of identifying the sense in which the man "wants" the woman to be opening her present would be, to say that he is in the state of mind of which certain remarks, to be instanced below, are necessarily non-reportive ex- pressions. By a necessarily non-reportive expression of a given state of mind I mean a manifestation or pseudo-manifestation of that state of mind which cannot also be a statement to the effect that one is in that state of mind. Thus a necessarily non-reportive expression of a given state of mind is not debarred from being a report or having a truth-value. It is only debarred</page><page sequence="34">84 J. M. HINTON from having as a matter of logical necessity the same truth- value as the statement that the subject is in that very state of mind. (A non-reportive expression of X need be thought of neither as a paradigm of expression, nor as a paradigmatic expression of X.) Wanting that p, in the relevant sense, when it does not consist in being so minded that you see it as good that (as you think) p, or in being so minded that you see it as bad that not p, consists in being in a state of mind of which all the following are non-reportive expressions-some truth-valued, some not. (a) "If I learn that p, I'll be glad, and if I learn that not p, I'll be sorry." (b) "Ifp I'm glad, and if not p I'm sorry." (c) "If p, that's good, and if not, that's bad." (d) "If only p!" (e) "Would that p!" It might seem as if these, or some of these, were only ex- pressions of that condition which we said was necessary, but not sufficient, for wanting: the condition of being predisposed to welcome the information that p, and to find the information that not p unwelcome. This idea would be a mistake, however, based I think mainly on the fact that (a) in particular, con- sidered irrelevantly as a report or prediction, is a bit like a statement to the effect that that condition obtains-though in fact it goes beyond such a statement, without coming up to the statement that one wants that p. The point, however, is that one who makes this remark lets on that he satisfies both the conditions which we said were jointly sufficient. So I think, like Radford, that there is a good sense in which a man can want "that which is", and indeed "that which he knows to be". Also that there is a good sense in which not only some but all hoping is wanting; because it seems as if anyone who hopes that p must be in the state of mind of which those are non-reportive expressions. What more to say about hope, however, on the "belief side", I do not know. Belief seems too strong, and wanting to believe too weak. The dictionary talks about "entertaining" expectations, and we might talk about being inclined to believe, or believing the proposition to be possibly true; but what are all those things? Spinoza's definition seems too episodic. I am afraid that I must leave the matter there. *# * * * *</page><page sequence="35">HOPING AND WISHING 85 Finally, some notes on this section about Wanting. I. When Professor D. M. Armstrong writes on desire (in his chapters on the Will in A Materialist Theory of the Mind) he is mainly concerned with active desire. This pre- occupation, which the familiar classification of desire under Conation expresses, is natural since our main interest in desire is as a motive to action. And it would surely be a strange world, if at all a possible one, in which conditions sufficient for one's seeing it as bad that not p were not in general sufficient also for one's trying to bring it about that p, supposing such an attempt to be possible. Yet one can admit this connexion between wanting and striving without defining wanting in terms of striving. Spinoza defines hope-which Radford, Armstrong and I all class as a kind of wanting-in terms of pleasure and not in terms of the conatus; though he links the two, over-tightly it may be, by a sort of psychological hedonism. And I think that, at any rate, the matter of seeing things as good or bad is essential to active desire as well as to the inert sort. This implies a criticism of Armstrong's model of the homing device. The Kamikaze's case is necessarily exceptional for a human being; and we do not recognise too much of our own nature in a robot which, after accomplishing its genocidal mission, just switches off or returns to base. To bring in the matter of seeing things as good or bad may-it is one of a number of things I should like to be clearer about here-make the sense of "wanting" which is defined applicable to language-users only. It might even seem ridiculous to describe a man's sexual desire, or his hunger, in these terms. I am not sure that it would be ridiculous, however. It would be ridiculous to describe such desires in these terms alone. 2. About the example of wanting your wife to be opening her present. One does not use this sort of example without eyeing such minatory facts as these: that wanting your wife to be opening her present and wanting Mrs. Smith to be opening her present-even when both these things are con- sidered in the light in which we have considered them, as things about no one but you-converge only if you are Mr. Smith; and that there is no common proposition p which is wanted to be true in both "Smith wants his wife to be opening her present" and "Jones wants his wife to be opening her</page><page sequence="36">86 J. M. HINTON present". All I seem to see in this is, that one cannot treat the case of Smith and Jones as a case of two people having the same wish and also treat all cases of having the same wish as cases of wanting the same proposition to be true. Smith's and Jones' cases are alike in being cases of wanting to instantiate the same function. Each man wants the function-* - -'s wife is opening her present to be true of him, or wants that . . -'s wife is opening her present. 3. About the statement (S) "John Doe is in a mental state such that anyone in that mental state who believes that p, sees it as good that p". That is, (3.)(Ya . (x) ((fx . Bxp) - Gxp)) -where the predicate-placeholder Y is restricted to predicates of the kind said to be "for mental states". If someone makes that statement, then there are various ways in which he can make his meaning clearer. One way would be, to insert the adverb "ex vi termini" before the word "anyone", a modal operator of logical necessity before the universal quantifier. The statement will then be verified under the same conditions as: (S,) "A mental-state term describes John Doe, which is such that, in the very meaning of that term, anyone whom it describes and who believes that p, sees it as good that p." An alternative way for the speaker to make his meaning clearer would be, for him to insert the adverb "not ex vi termini" before the word "anyone", a modal operator of logical contingency before the universal quantifier. The statement will then be verified under the same conditions as: (S2) "A mental-state term describes John Doe, which is such that, not in the very meaning of that term but as a logically contingent law, anyone whom it describes and who believes that p, sees it as good that p." The speaker may not intend either of those things. He may simply mean what he says, and what he says does not have two distinct meanings. But although he need not intend the statement in either of those ways particularly, the statement cannot be true without being true in one, or both, of those ways -by John Doe's being in a mental state such that ex vi</page><page sequence="37">HOPING AND WISHING 87 termini, etc., or by John Doe's being in a mental state such that not ex vi termini, etc. (S) sans phrases, used to mean just what it says, is the weak disjunction of S-with-the-first-adverb and S-with-the-second-adverb; and for the speaker to say that this is exactly what he means would be a third way of making himself clearer. Now when we were stating a requirement for the truth of "John Doe wants that p", we were entitled to mention any one of those three things: (S,), (S2), or (S, v S2). But if we want to clarify, to reveal the logical content of, the statement: (T) "John Doe is mentally predisposed/to see it as good that p if and when he believes that p" -then surely we must pick (S,) as the one and only member of the triad of which we can say that it and ( T) will be verified under the same conditions. The Australian Materialists assume that we must, and I strongly feel that they are so far right; though if this is challenged I am not sure how to reply. If we speak of a contention as having been made good for the time being when-as far as we can see-it can be resisted only by advancing something that both needs and lacks justification; and if (T) does indeed have the same verification- conditions as (S,); then this in itself does not yet make good for the time being the contention, that John Doe's having been predisposed in the relevant way at a certain time consisted in his then and there having satisfied some unspecified physiological condition. It may have consisted in his having had a certain belief, and although we may be shown that belief consists in satisfying some unspecified physiological condition we have not, I think, yet been shown this. The predisposition may have consisted in having a belief, because there could be a contingent law, in respect of certain particular propositions A and B, that anyone who believes A and who also believes B, sees it as good that B. To be predisposed to something, is to be pre- disposed in some way to it; and it is not before you have "physicalised" all the obviously possible ways of being pre- disposed to the given thing, that you have "physicalised" the predisposition to it. The foregoing means incidentally, and rather disconcertingly, that beliefs could be logically sufficient for desire-at least unless I was wrong to say earlier that the predisposition we</page><page sequence="38">88 J. M. HINTON have been talking about, together with the belief that one will "now" react in the relevant way if one accepts the relevant information, is sufficient for wanting. Suppose it is a contingent law that anyone who believes that another has done him an injury, and who also believes (q) that that other has met or will meet with misfortune, counts this as a plus. (And that if he believes that not q, he counts this as a minus; "not q" being, of course, that that other neither has nor will, etc.) Then John Doe's belief that Richard Roe has done him an injury, together with John's believing that he will "now" react in the relevant way if he comes to one of the relevant beliefs about Richard and misfortune, would be sufficient for John's wanting Richard to meet with misfortune, on my account of the matter. But it is perhaps not only on my account of the matter, that wanting might consist in believing. For if one thinks, like Armstrong, that "wanting that p" consists in being predisposed to try to bring it about that p; then it is not clear that one could not be so predisposed by a belief.</page></plain_text>
