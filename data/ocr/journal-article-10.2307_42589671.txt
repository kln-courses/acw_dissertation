<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Thought, Fall 2001 71 Eating Meat: What Our Schools Teach Us about the Tender Carnivore Vicky Newman University of Utah Why is compassion not part of our established curriculum, an inherent part of our education? Compassion, awe, wonder, curiosity, exaltation, humility -these are the very foundation of any real civilization, no longer the prerogatives, the preserves of any one church, but belonging to everyone, every child in every home, in every school. -Yehudi Menuhin, Just for Animals The Perversion of Vegetarianism In November of 1995, representatives from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) came to local schools in Columbia, South Carolina, to encourage children to eat vegetables and to alert them to the fact that when they eat meat, they are not only eating animals, but also are involved in their pain and suffering. One of the volunteers, "Chris P. Carrot," was dressed as a giant carrot and was on the sidewalk outside the school in the morning when the children were arriving, some by bus, but many delivered by their parents. The carrot remained on the sidewalk and tried to talk to children about what they were eating when they ate hamburgers and other meats and to suggest vegetarianism as an alternative. The response to the carrot was swift. In no time, the principal demanded that the carrot leave the school premises and threatened to call the police if Chris P. refused. Indeed, the police did show up at the school and insisted Chris P. and the other representatives leave. The carrot had worked many of the parents into a state of outrage and their</page><page sequence="2">72 Eating Meat responses provide the starting place for an investigation into the para- doxical attitudes about animals in our culture and into the ways these attitudes are reinforced and perpetuated through school curricula. According to the reports in the local newspaper, Chris P. Carrot said he has been banned from most schools on his national "Eat Your Veggies, Not Your Friends" tours. According to local school officials, the school did not ban the carrot from the premises, but rather "chose not to participate in the program. Our schools receive requests from organizations that are promoting a variety of issues almost on a daily basis" (Patterson 1995, B3). Spokespersons went on to say that the schools do not promote any particular diets, only good nutrition, and that the decisions about what children eat should come from parents. In fact many schools, including the schools in the Columbia area, do promote specific diets. They promote these diets in their meat-heavy menus, which in a typical week feature hamburgers, pizza with meat, hot dogs, and chicken patties. They promote them by offering few real nutritional alternatives to a heavy meat diet. And they promote them when they allow the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at school picnics and various sporting events. Indeed, the Wienermobile's appearance has become somewhat of a tradition at many of these functions, an assurance of quality and trustworthy food. However, when Chris P. Carrot greeted children at the schools as they arrived, waving to them with his "Eat Your Veggies, Not Your Friends" sign, he was asked to leave by the principal, who stood between the children and the carrot until a security guard arrived. Later, when confronted by Richland County sheriffs deputies, PETA representatives gave them buttons and pamphlets before leaving. "How can they do this to small children?" one parent asked. "These children don't know what it means to be a vegetarian. It's cruel to say these things to small children." "If these people want to be vegetarians, that's their business," said another. "But I don't want them to try to put their beliefs on my child" (Patterson 1995, Bl). According to the local paper, afterwards, this parent "mockingly scolded a friend for swatting a bee. "You'd better not hurt that bee,' she said. The big orange carrot might get mad'"(Patterson 1995, Bl). Later in the week, letters appeared on the editorial page from parents who were angry about the incident. However, only one letter attacked the PETA volunteer for belonging to an organization that used illegal breaking and entering tactics to free animals in various states of misery. Most responses were more vague, accusing the PETA people of being "perverts" and "anti-American." This kind of attitude is the first line of defense against those who challenge the status quo. In the larger environmental debate, according to Jimmie Killingsworth and Jacqueline Palmer (1993), opponents</page><page sequence="3">Vicky Newman 73 borrow from popular psychology a code for political enmity that uses cultural stereotypes to belittle the character or evidence of their oppo- nents. The implication is that, for now, the danger to the earth is "all in the minds" of the environmentalists, but that, if not contained, environ- mental concern might spread, developing into an epidemic of "mass hysteria".... The label "hysterical" means that, from the perspective of... conservative critics of contemporary environmentalist!, only an aberrant imagination could see trouble brewing in the progressive development of Western civilization. (2) This holds for the attitude toward animal rights activists as well. Like the parents who labeled the PETA carrot and accompanying volunteers "perverts," Steve Baker (1993) points out that even in scholarly studies, the tactic is to position those who have particular kinds of concerns outside the norm (214). According to Baker, in this literature, "such people are unbalanced, they are uncivilized, and they are childishly selfish, and they lack the common sense to see that humans are worth more than animals" (215). What was perverse about the carrot? Along with the buttons they distributed, the PETA volunteers gave children pamphlets that informed them: "hamburgers are really cows who have been separated from their families and killed" and "bacon, bologna, and hot dogs are really little piggies who are taken in crowded, smelly trucks to their death" (Patterson 1995, Bl). According to a PETA spokesperson, they were not there to convert children to vegetarianism, but to let them know "what happens to animals when they become food, and let them decide for themselves." Beyond the humor some people attributed to the incident lay more serious issues. Why such outrage when people challenge the severed connections between the consumption of meat and animal suffering? How is it that the slaughterers of Bessie the Cow have not been questioned for any kind of perversion? Why is there no outrage when events are sponsored by Oscar Mayer and other purveyors of human/ animal dualism? This essay explores this ideological dualism and points to some of its implications in school curriculum. Taking a cultural studies approach, I assume a broad sweep in my definition of curriculum, one that connects a range of cultural practices and the ways in which these practices inform and shape one another. Borrowing from Michel Foucault (1979), I explore how this ideological dualism manifests itself in particular practices and everyday activities and how the cracks and fissures of ideology can be located and interrogated through these practices. In particular, I look at how exploring meat eating reveals conflicted underlying assumptions about the place of animals in relation to humans. In addition, the</page><page sequence="4">74 Eating Meat promotion of meat as a necessary part of good nutrition reveals itself to be part of both an overt and hidden school curriculum. The intersections of the literary, philosophical, political, and economic are revealed within this approach, in which I consider the philosophical arguments of environmentalists, animal rights activists, authors of fiction and poetry, as well as practices within educational and government institutions. The Culture and Economy of Meat In the 1920s, the meatpacking industry, backed by the USDA, saw the advantage of promoting meat in the public schools. The campaign centered around the message that meat equals protein, good nutrition, and good health and was part of the USDA policy to increase farm income that centered on animal production and had been lobbied by the meat industry (Beiden &amp; Forte 1976, 58-69). In this scenario, children must eat meat for proper growth and development because it is the ideal source of protein. That children should not be told about the conditions of animals and the reality of meat is a fairly recent and mostly urban and suburban phenomena: children on the farm and even in urban settings were exposed to slaughter prior to the middle of the nineteenth century, and farm children still witness and often participate in the processing of meat. This is not to suggest that the lives of animals in the barnyard are idyllic, but only to point out how the scale of factory farming has intensified the necessity to rewrite and revise the process. If one myth that surrounds meat is its dietary necessity, then the human/animal dualism becomes a necessity as well. The repercussions of the intensification of this dualism in mass meat production have become complicit in the visual narratives that surround the consumption of meat; narratives that sanitize, idealize, and decontextualize the processes and conditions of the industry. According to Jim Mason and Peter Singer (1980), the impetus to boost meat consumption in the 1930s was a response to the discovery of kwashiorkor and its link to protein deficiency in Africa. After this discovery, instances of malnutrition in the United States were all identified as protein-related. The USDA put out food charts and other materials to advise consumers to choose from among 12 food groups, three of which were animal products. During World War II, these became the "Basic Seven" after intense pressure from the livestock and dairy industry. Continued pressure from these industries was instrumental in reducing the "Basic Seven" to the "Basic Four" in 1956 and meat and dairy products constituted half of these diets (Mason &amp; Singer 1980, 115). This reduction occurred because from 1938 to 1956, according to the American</page><page sequence="5">Vicky Newman 75 Meat Institute, the rate of meat consumption declined. The flesh and dairy industries were alarmed by this and began their food group campaign which included working closely with the government to reduce the food groups. They also were instrumental in continuing to distribute and promote the Basic Four posters, especially in the schools, where the posters became a standard part of the curriculum in classrooms, defining for generations the notion of good nutrition. These groups, of course, found their way into the textbooks or the "official knowledge" of the school curriculum (Adams 1995, 33-34). In 1991, the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine intro- duced a new four-foods group: whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits. This was news the public paid attention to, given that the committee was composed of doctors, rather than marginalized vegetar- ians and other organic suspects. However, the USDA quickly followed with their revision of the Basic Four. Given all the recent evidence that meat was associated with heart and digestive diseases- and to a variety of forms of cancer- and under pressure to keep meat and dairy products in the diet, the USDA designed the New Age pyramid that placed flesh and dairy at the top, but with less space. The diminished space was supposedly counteracted by their placement at the top, yet the meat and dairy industry protested to the USDA that "the pyramid was 'confusing,' it 'stigmatized' their products both by the reduction in size, and by their placement next to that of fats and sweets" (Adams 1995, 34). Following the protest, the USDA withdrew the pyramid. After an $855,000 consumer survey, which indicated the pyramid was not confusing, it was reintro- duced in 1992 (Adams 1995, 37). During the 1993 E. Coli scare, in which at least two children died as a result of undercooked meat and many more became sick, the focus of debate, according to Adams (1995) was not "why do we continue to eat dead bodies?" but "how should dead bodies be cooked so that we do not die from them?" (37-38). Despite the overwhelming logic of Adams' paradigm shift, children and older students in schools do not examine the implications of eating meat nor is the industry's influence on official knowledge and language about the process part of school curricula. Instead, we have a steady diet of meat and information that reinforces both its necessity, glamour, and even sexiness. And much advertising about meat either constitutes it as an American social process (McDonald's Happy Meals, playgrounds, and birthday parties; Kincheloe 2001), or as an aesthetic and eroticized process (note the images and camera work that represent hamburgers, steaks, and chicken). In the name of good nutrition, parents endorse meat consumption in public schools. Ironically, in a recent interview, a</page><page sequence="6">7 6 Eating Meat slaughterhouse human-resources director revealed that his plant was one of the low-end processing plants. "We process 'canners and cutters'- that means the ole rickety cows. Kind of second rate cows. Mostly, we have government contracts. We sell a lot to schools for school lunches" (Weddle 2000, 146). Environmental degradation raises additional issues associated with massive meat production and consumption. Though we inform children about erosion, about water pollution, and about rain forest destruction, these issues are not connected to factory farming or slaughterhouses directly and consistently in most texts and curricula. Rain forest destruc- tion is a popular topic, but the point of view is often that others, who do not understand the delicate balance of nature, are responsible for this destruction and that the Western nations must try to help them understand what they are doing- to educate them about their mistakes. The boycott of McDonald's and other hamburger giants because of connections to rainforest destruction was brief. In our own country, the loss of topsoil and waste runoff is massive, and threatens an already delicate ecosystem. And in the backyards of the poor, factory farms hold massive amounts of wastes that threaten local environmental devastation during each excessive rain. The most vivid example of the potential of this kind of disaster was during the 1999 hurricane in eastern North Carolina. The legacy of the pig farms was exposed as the waters drowned tens of thousands of trapped animals, burst dams of liquid feces, and created a potential cholera epidemic because dead pig bodies floated everywhere and could not be located and disposed of for weeks. The furor over such devastation and potential health threats went on only until the cleanup was complete. The racist and classist environmental policy of locating hazardous "industry" in the backyards of, in this case, the rural poor, finally assured that the outrage would be subdued in the face of their desperate need for employment and fear on the part of those in more upscale areas that this kind of industry might intrude into their more idyllic and sanitized neighborhoods. Other ecological consequences are rarely identified or investigated. Most prominent is the amount of natural resources, including water, forests, and fossil fuels, required to produce meat as opposed to grain for human consumption. This is in addition to the pollution that occurs from livestock production (Adams 1995; Lappe 1982; Mason &amp; Singer 1980; Rifkin 1992). Besides the ecological consequences of meat production and con- sumption, meat eating and manhood have a pervasive cultural history. Jose Limon (1997) writes about the connections between meat eating and machismo in Mexican culture that draw not on the traditions that unite</page><page sequence="7">Vicky Newman 77 the spirit of human and animal as in the totemic cultures Paul Shepard (1998) articulates, but in domination and power to destroy that are part of class-based and gendered culture. Feminists, particularly ecofeminists, identify the culture/nature dualism as integral to interrogating patriar- chal ideology ( Adams 1990; Collard 1988; Diamond &amp; Orenstein 1990; Gaard 1993; Merchant 1980); that is, that culture has and continues to control nature. Adams suggests that despite the inclusion of animal rights and the parallels feminists have drawn between the domination of women and animals, "a persistent patriarchal ideology regarding animals as instruments has kept the experience of animals from being fully incorporated within ecofeminism,, (87). The strength that allows this dominance, that defines manhood is closely connected with meat eating in many cultures. Fiddes (1991) points to how Man the Hunter defines maleness in numerous societies that range from hunting to technologi- cal. And in societies in which hunting is no longer practiced, "meat is a male preserve" (145) that "endows a vital, virile potency" (67). Fiddes' discussion of the first claim men have on meat resonates with the stories many women of my generation tell and continues to be a reality in many households, especially those that operate within poverty. Men get the best cuts, the most meat, and when necessary, the only meat. Meat is a symbol of virility and power over nature and animals and imbues the consumer with sexual prowess as well. This mythology of meat becomes normalized, as does the positioning, relative to humans, it assigns to animals. Within this system, the conditions of the lives and deaths of animals is divorced more and more aggressively from our consumption of them. They are a mass; it is natural to eat them; it is inevitable to eat them; the descriptions of what is happening to them are few and marginalized. The Pervasive Paradox Although books that question human attitudes and treatment of animals have always been available, with few exceptions, those books that are considered great works of literature have dealt with the human predicament; the world in which we are immersed serving as a back- ground for our traumas and triumphs or as a means to our transcendence. The great divide between the world in children's literature and the relationships with animals that are possible and the world of adult literature and the disappearance of those kinds of real and imaginary places signifies a rite of passage into the adult world. In this world, empathy and identification with animals must give way to the under- standing of what often must befall them: death and suffering for purposes</page><page sequence="8">78 Eating Meat of human development, food consumption, medical advances to prolong human life, and even to satisfy the whims of vanity and fashion. Children grow up in the company of animals, often as household pets, and in the imaginations of authors of children's literature and writers and producers of children's television and film. Gene Myers (1998) notes the "plain delight, intense interest, and strong feelings animals evoke in young children" as something "at once quite transparent and yet hard to fathom" (ix). Literary traditions often chronicle the passage out of nature and into a manmade world, a passage that, according to C. L. Rawlins (1998), results not in recognizing "the land's deep imprint," but in a "manufactured sameness, "(xiii) a kind of stalled development. The separation from the land- from nature- and from animals reflects a caste-based culture, according to Paul Shepard, who further speculates that this culture- mass culture- "draws collective power" from blocking development and uses the madness that results to "spur adolescent fury, harnessing it with ideologies and armies, or turning it against the land, to raise pyramids, cathedrals, concrete dams" (Rawlins 1998, xi). Despite disagreement among some deep ecologists and animal rights activists, Brian Luke (1997) argues, based on an ecofeminist model, that the same anthropocentric ethics that undergird our treatment of wilder- ness and the ecosystems are at work in our treatment of domestic animals (342-43). According to Luke, anthropocentrism limits our abili- ties to create emotional and social space for deep environmentalism and animal liberation (350). Luke argues that environmentalism provides a model to link the ways systems of oppression operate in a variety of arenas (gender, race, class, so forth), but also recognizes the "different and distinct values" of animal rights and environmental movements, differences that should be affirmed and not set in opposition or conflict with one another. If we examine the treatment of animals in our culture, we discover a pervasive paradox: animals revered but also objectified and often given the harshest of treatment. In Regarding Animals , sociologists Arnold Arluke and Clinton Sanders (1996) recognize these conflicting values in our attitudes and treatment of animals and seek to understand how, instead of examining these conflicts as a matter of course, so few people are aware of them. They also argue for the importance of identifying some of the social forces that under gird our ambivalence toward animals. They examine the experiences and attitudes of people who work in veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and primate labs, as a way to explore the sociology of the experience of objectifying animals and denying emotional responses to killing and maiming animals because of overpopulation or scientific experimentation.</page><page sequence="9">Vicky Newman 79 They place their study of these workers into a broader sociozoological perspective. Similar to Donna Harraway's critical reading of the illustra- tion of the ascent of man and its accompanying hierarchical and gendered classifications of male and female as well as the hierarchy that culminates in "man" over beasts, Arluke and Sanders see in the scientific classifica- tion of orders a still calcified assumption about our supremacy over animals and indeed, the fate of animals still determined by socially constructed ideas of "good" and "bad" beasts, "higher" and "lower" beasts. They observe that despite work by scholars such as Lynda Burke and Stephen Jay Gould, who have criticized the chain of being theory on "logical, moral, and scientific grounds, it still lingers on in contemporary thinking.... The history of ideas has demonstrated that certain notions become so pervasive and central to the thought of a culture over time people uncritically apply these ideas anew" (169). But what of this fear of looking at what we do to animals when we eat them? What is it we are so invested in, that our culture, including institutions of learning, will not allow the process to be honestly represented? It's Natural to Eat Meat Fiddes (1991) argues that meat is a natural symbol in our culture, a symbol of prestige, nutrition, and of human control over the natural world (2). According to Fiddes, "This does not necessarily mean we consciously glory in the subjugation of animals whenever we bite into a piece of meat.... It is rather that the principle of power over nature is an omnipresent thread running through the culture in which we are raised, and which forms the context of our thought and debate" (3). Much as Louis Althusser (1971) explicated the mechanisms of our "interpellation," Fiddes argues for an underlying ideological order that works as a framework for understanding existence that is beneficial to a given social order. Fiddes points out that in western history, human subjugation of the wild and natural has been "a central theme- at times an almost religious imperative - and. . .that consumption of animal flesh has been an ideal exemplar of that control" (3). He reads the gaps and silences as significant to the ideology: Our willingness to eschew confronting certain aspects of meat's identity is more than a matter of preferring to sidestep that which might be unsavory. The fact that most of us make little mention of the domination inherent in rearing animals for slaughter does not indicate that it is irrelevant. On the contrary, that which remains unsaid about meat conveys an added dimension of meaning which is particularly potent. It</page><page sequence="10">80 Eating Meat is the very taken-for-grantedness of the values implicit in the meat system which makes the message so powerful, whilst rationalizations of meat's importance (such as nutrition and prestige) partly serve to obscure these values from our consciousness. (44) Our aversion to acknowledging the "unsavory" is again articulated by the slaughterhouse worker (Weddle, 2000). The worker, who has moved up to a management position in the slaughterhouse and is now slaugh- terhouse human-resources director, reveals how difficult it is to keep workers on the job. According to the director: the biggest problem is that nobody wants to kill cows... the plant is always in trouble with the city. . . . Sometimes we've dumped blood into the lagoons. The horrible smell- we got forced to put some kind of chimney filters on the rendering department, and the smell is still j ust incredible . There's a stigma for people who work here... I belonged to several professional organizations, and when they found out where I worked they were like, "Oh my gosh, you work there?" People are just disgusted by it. Yet isn't it funny how people eat all those hamburgers? (146) Much of this kind of work is now relegated to foreign workers and the poor, whose desperation for employment sends them to the slaughter- houses in almost every state. (In the South, chicken slaughterhouses are worked by mostly African-American women and poor White women). Unlike the hunter, who in the act of killing is constructed as manly and cunning, in the slaughterhouse, mass killing of captive animals carries the stench of the operation, its inhumane system, its piles of guts and lakes of blood. We want to remove ourselves from it and from those who spend their time in that kind of work. We do not want to consider the lives of animals in these kinds of conditions, but to think of cuts of their bodies divorced from them as living creatures who feel pain and deprivation. In The Lives of Animals, the novelist J. M. Coetzee (1999) explores the issue of animal rights through a fictional account of a professor who is haunted by animal cruelty and who has become increasingly withdrawn from human company because of the "stupefying magnitude" of cruelty to animals that she understands is taking place on farms, in slaughter- houses, in factories, and in laboratory experimentation all over the world. In this story, Elizabeth Costello delivers a series of lectures at a prestigious university; in fact, the university where her son teaches. The novel takes the form of lectures, and reactions to them by Costello's family and other academics. The philosophical issues mirror something of the debate that is carried on in popular culture treatments of animal rights advocates, though on a different intellectual level, and perhaps, even more highly abstracted. The arguments against animal rights hinge</page><page sequence="11">Vicky Newman 81 to a great extent on the absence of intellectual capacity on the part of animals and on what is perceived as a hysterical posture by Costello. According to one professor: To animals, death is continuous with life. It is only among certain very imaginative human beings that one encounters a horror of dying so acute that they then project it onto other beings, including animals. Animals live and then they die, that is all.... It is licit to kill animals, I would say, because their lives are not as important to them as ours are to us...." (64) He goes on to refer to the belief that humans share community with animals as simply a "piece of prelapsarian wistfulness"(65). Costello responds: If I do not convince you, that is because my words, here, lack the power to bring home to you the wholeness, the unabstracted, unintellectual nature, of that animal being. That is why I urge you to read the poets who return the living, electric being to language; and if the poets do not move you, I urge you to walk, flank to flank, beside the beast that is prodded down the chute to his executioner. (65) Costello refuses the premise that reason is the important and distinguish- ing characteristic that creates and sustains a hierarchy between animals and humans. She instead calls on poetry and the lived experience of the body as a means to connect animal to animal, body and desire to body and desire. Disrupting the hierarchy and challenging the assumption that the welfare of animals must fit into our own philosophical and dietary agendas is a radical act, one that provokes discomfort and dismissal. Costello's empathy for animals is seen as a sentimental response; a response that is negative and that reinforces the pathetic fallacy. According to Lawrence Buell (1995), this "ascription of human feelings to nature entered pastoral poetry with Theocritus," and reached its height in late neoclassical literature, lending dignity to the minute and over- looked, "a breakthrough of great importance to the romantics" (184). These personifications and stylizations were criticized heavily in the next century for artificiality and sentimentality -as "distortion[s] of objective reality" (187) and as "regression" (217)- criticisms that continue to be leveled at many nature writers. Yet according to Buell's penetrating analysis, it is precisely this wedding of the affective and the scientific scrutiny of the particular that has stressed the kinship between human and nonhuman and that has called anthropocentric assumptions into question. In addition, Buell understands the importance of the pathetic fallacy in bringing humans to an ethic of care. Buell asks, "Who is more likely to treat other people as machines, a person who has trained herself to feel that plants and animals are fellow beings or a person who looks at</page><page sequence="12">82 Eating Meat them as convenient resources?" (217). The troping of nature's personhood is important because of the "underlying ethical orientation" it implies (217). We must be intimate with the natural world- in our particular understanding of how it works, and in our emotional responses to its existence and beauty. The collusion of the pathetic fallacy with the minute particulars of the natural world and of the lives of animals offers a way to re-imagine the world, to escape the "massive failure of imagination" that Barry Lopez (1983) maintains "characterizes western exploitation of the nonhuman world" (387). In probably the best-known volume on the relationship between humans and animals, Man and the Natural World : A History of the Modern Sensibility , Keith Thomas (1983) explores the theological and theoretical foundations of human ascendancy in western culture. Draw- ing from sources as varied as Aristotle and the Stoics to Tudor and Stuart England and including modern history, he traces the view that nature existed to serve the purposes of human interest. Indeed, he quotes the historian Lynn White, Jr., who described Christianity as "the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen" (23). He goes on to note that based on Cartesian doctrines, humans were further separated from nature and animals. Since Anglo-Saxon times the church had stood against the worship of nature, reinforcing a human/nature dualism, and Descartes' philosophy, making humans the measure of all things, had the effect of further downgrading animals (22, 33). Animals were not only denied souls, but did not feel pain; "the cry of a beaten dog was no more evidence of the brute's suffering than was the sound of an organ proof that the instrument felt pain when struck. Animal howls and writhings were merely external reflexes, unconnected with any inner sensation" (33). Elaine Scarry (1985) confirms the idea that animals' comparative worth- lessness has been (and still is) enmeshed in most notions of what it means to be civilized. Scary points to the conversion from human to animal sacrifice in the Old Testament as a defining moment in civilization, a moment that differentiated the sacrifice and suffering of humans from that of animals, encoding as holy writ the human body as a privileged space, specifically one privileged over other animals ( 148). Thomas ( 1983) points out that "Descartes' explicit aim had been to make men lords and possessors of nature'... and created an absolute break between man and the rest of nature, thus clearing the way very satisfactorily for the uninhibited exercise of human rule" (34-35). He goes on to trace the historical construction of ways to maintain the boundary between humans and beasts, and how transgression of the human/animal dichotomy was a source of great anxiety. According to Thomas, men have always projected the impulses they most fear about</page><page sequence="13">Vicky Newman 83 themselves onto animals: "ferocity, gluttony, sexuality- even though it was men, not beasts, who made war on their own species, ate more than was good for them and were sexually active all year round" (p. 41). For Paul Shepard (1998), it is the combination of Judaic and Greek heritage, intensified by the introspection of psychoanalysis in the twentieth century that has advanced this rending of humans from animals and nature. "Of generations reared on introspection, analysis, dream study, and group dynamics, exploring the affluence produced by its Faustian drive modeled after the Creator whose prominent feature is His will, the inheritors of Jewish inward vision and Greek narcissism, little else could be expected than the loss of ecological roots of mind" (37). Meat eating, then, is implicated in a hierarchy of nature that assures the supremacy of humans and encoded in philosophical, religious, and scientific textual authority and practice. In addition, the process involved in meat-eating has been sanitized through its further separation from the domestic site, through its plastic wrappings in the market, and most especially through its cultural constructions in the media and in fast food restaurants. The Idealized Family Farm At the moment our human world is based on the suffering and destruc- tion of millions of non-humans. -Maureen Duñy, Men and Beasts In introductions to texts about animals and their treatment, writers often recall moments when they were required to separate themselves from nature- from animals- by accepting the inevitability of animal deaths at the hands of humans, to serve as food, as objects of the hunt, or as victims of mistreatment. This process is recalled as a normal part of coming of age, and if not recalled in an epiphanic moment, it is recalled later as a process that took place as a normalized part of the passage from childhood to adulthood. I recall many of the same kinds of incidences, though I think they were cumulative and in my mind, worked together to desensitize me to the sufferings of my fellow creatures. I remember that most of the incidents were gendered in some way- often something the men in the family didn't want to tell in front of the women, but sometimes they told a story to provoke a sense of outrage in us. Invariably, the male children were made to understand that they should harden themselves publicly about such things. Writing about children's fantasies and mythic understanding, Kieran Egan (1997) cites a study by Rogers and Robinson that shows that</page><page sequence="14">84 Eating Meat although children find a wide range of stories appealing, they ranked first fantasy stories that include "an animal who could talk" (45). Books for young children are often about animals and their adventures, about animal families, about animal friends. The rite of passage clearly is one that divides us from our emotional responses to the suffering of animals. And this concern about animals and nature in general is characterized as something feminine, therefore negative and childlike (Adams 1990; Gaard 1993; Griffin 1978; Merchant 1980;Westling 1996). However, children are allowed their fantasies about connections to animals. In school curricula as well as in the home, children are encouraged to identify with animals and to have and bond with pets. But these treatments are fundamentally paradoxical in the culture at large and in schools because schools participate in the institutional subjugation of and violence to animals and in the lie about the reality of that violence. Old MacDonald's farm is still the model for our idealized notion of life in the country and of the lives of animals. Children's literature promotes it, and advertising promotes it both for children and adults. Fisher Price uses it to inform (and control) the imaginations of children about the lives of animals. However, the family farm is rapidly disappearing, replaced for the most part with factory farms such as those run by giant corporations like ADM and Con Agra, in which conditions are overwhelming to look at and contemplate. And so it is that the idyllic and romanticized images of life for animals on the farm that we insist upon give way to the horrific conditions and scale of what is now the norm of American agriculture. Children and adults, however, are insulated from the realities of these kinds of agricultural operations. The operations are usually set apart and closed off to the general public. They are secretive to outsiders- those not involved in direct profit taking, and they generate their own publications for adults and children about the conditions of the business. Their rhetoric defends keeping animals in confinement: When they are en- closed within the factory buildings, all animals get food, medical treat- ment, and are protected from the elements and predators. In addition, because children and adults living in urban settings and suburbs are so distanced from these kinds of operations and the very process of meat production itself, children learn about animals from literature and advertising that idealizes the methods and conditions of farming. The corporations produce their own literature that includes coloring books that are unquestionably distributed in schools, books that show idyllic pastoral settings and animal moms with their spring babies. This is not to suggest that life for animals on family farms as opposed to factory farms was or is idyllic. The lives of animals on the farm also leave much to be</page><page sequence="15">Vicky Newman 85 desired. Raised as they are for consumption or to work to exhaustion before being rendered for food, they too are often victims of indifferent cruelty for the greater good of feeding humans. Are the lessons here really any different? The family farm practices of confining, manipulat- ing, and slaughtering animals for consumption are implicated as well in the philosophical debate, although it is factory farming that has come under the most intense scrutiny. Veal calves on family farms are still held in crates in darkness, separated from their mothers, and made anemic by their diets, and the examples go on. Yet "of the five billion animals slaughtered in the U.S. each year for food, only a handful live and die outside the oppression of high- volume, high tech modern farming" (Coats 1989,17-18). In his book, Coats provides us with a series of descriptions of factory farming conditions and practices, descriptions that emphasize the fear, pain, and suffering that animals endure in the meat industry in becoming our meals. In these dark places, Coats notes such things as derangement and aggression of young pigs who are confined in small spaces in large numbers. Their coping behaviors include eating one another's tails, repetitive move- ments and gnawing. In the industry, they call it cannibalism and solve the problem by cutting off pigleťs tails without anesthesia. In addition, teeth are clipped off with wire cutters, and males' testicles are cut off (25). His descriptions of the merciless milking and breeding of dairy cows, of the cruelty in the treatment of veal calves, of the endless terror and suffering during transportation are wrenching accounts of unbelievably cruel indifference. The Lethal Turn of Ideology and Pedagogy If the problem is that we are in denial about the conditions of the lives of animals in meat production, a recent incident in a public school in California serves to complicate the issue. It can be read as both a direct response to challenges about denial and as an overt example of the human/animal dualism. The incident occurred in an elementary school, a small public school in the horse country of California which allowed students to raise a steer for a project. The steer, who the students named T-Bone, was slaughtered at the school and the children watched. The butcher came to the school, used a stun bolt and then carried out the rest of the dressing process. Some nearby high school students were there to protest, but an interview with the principal revealed that it was a decision to provide hands-on education, to allow students to see what the process was like. According to the protesting high school students, this process</page><page sequence="16">86 Eating Meat would desensitize these young children. The participating students who were interviewed commented that it was a good anatomy lesson: they learned close up and with great immediacy about the parts of steer anatomy. Some students, as reported in the Salt Lake City Deseret News on May 19 of this year, became sick and had to leave. Most of them, however, were "fascinated" by the process. All children who were there had received permission from their parents to witness the slaughter. This, according to the principal, was pedagogically sound, both in its methodology and even historically: this was exactly the kind of experi- ence students used to have in 4H and in agricultural programs. It demystified the process and provided opportunities for intensive biology and anatomy lessons. It was discovery learning; a constructivist approach ( Salt Lake City Deseret News 2001, May 19). The students had taken care of the animal. He had led a comfortable life compared to animals on factory farms and even compared to most food or dairy animals on family farms. The students even had a somewhat personal relationship with him. So this example raises the issue of whether killing animals that have been raised under more humane farming methods is acceptable. However, if our denial is about identity with animals, which raises the issue of objectification of animals for the greater good of humans, then the "anatomy lesson" has frightening implications. This was a lesson about the killing of animals as a scientific process, as a process that should be devoid of emotional response, devoid of empathy on the part of the students. They are not required to be accountable to the living animal they participate in killing, only to their sense of intellectual and physical appetites. It denies the objectification that the science lesson requires as well as the indoctrination of anthro- pocentric curriculum and practice. It reinforces a dominant view that has implications for animals, the nonhuman world in general, and, as has been expressed by Carol Adams (1995), for women and minorities. The lesson is body-denying and continues to elude the critical work of discovering how systems of oppression are interlocking. The violence of eating animals is doubly institutionalized if we examine its implications in schools. Economically, meat production is a huge industry and, as mentioned above, has its own system of maintenance, including main- taining the illusions of animals' happiness, the need for humans to eat flesh to survive, and the inevitability of animals' status as meat. This involves the denial of subjectivity of animals at the level of ideology, discourse, and practice. The school setting does not provide a framework within which to place either uncomfortable and conflicted feelings about meat-eating or to problematize the construction of these animals as appropriate victims. This kind of ideology and practice is institutionalized</page><page sequence="17">Vicky Newman 87 as scientific, promoting objective study of reality, non sentimental procedure, and denial of individuality and sociability of animals. Concluding Remarks We are holding on to Old McDonald's farm. According to Cheryl Herr (1996), "one of the more startling aspects of family farming is its ideological consistency, at least in its public face, across decades, miles, cultures, and nations" (146). Herr observes that it is a story of the effort to retain and reinforce the values of small farm life that are particularly potent because within that setting desire, hope, gratification, and self- actualization are all at stake. Literary and Hollywood representations of the farm abound, and many of the more recent films have had specifically to do with the erosion of the small farm in the face of giant corporate farming. Herr contends that many of these texts are about the profound internal damage suffered by these families on the farm, especially that suffered by the "patriarch whose authority is eroded by a multinational corporate symbolic order" (147). In the United States, we have been invested in the small farmer as ideal citizen and paragon of virtue since Jefferson, and students are still imbued with the notion of the virtuousness of the small farm and the ideal of the family that works the farm. Herr would argue that we continue to sustain or restage this agrarian imaginary zone even in the face of its disappearance. And so it is that in the struggle to recapture that imaginary zone, we have refused to examine the imaginary zone of factory farming, the symbolic order that has been the culmination of chemicals, big business, technology, and a human/animal dualism that fosters domination over nature and indifference to the destruction and suffering of animals. Although fictional works that offer the narrative voices of animals are often categorized as sentimental, based on Buell's (1999) contentions, they serve to help connect us to animals and nature in profound ways. Many of these works are considered classics of literature for children: Bambi, Beautiful Joe , Black Beauty, Watership Down, and Charlotte's Web, among many others. Films have begun to introduce children (and adults) to this perspective as well: Babe and Chicken Run both deal with the suffering, fear, and to some extent, the reality of domestic animals' lives. And recent books for adults that are written from animals' points of view suggest an awareness of our urgent need to reconnect with this world. The White Bone brings us into the world of African elephants and their attempts to avoid the slaughter that is taking place there, and positions us to identify with the profound attachments and affections</page><page sequence="18">88 Eating Meat elephants have with and for one another and with the land in which they are immersed. These kinds of works, however, have been berated for their anthropomorphic insinuations and projections. Can we speak for animals? Should we try? Certainly the "indignity of speaking for others" (Owens 1992) under girds much of postmodern theorizing about agency and self-realization and actualization. Various groups have pointed out the failure of (in most cases) a dominant group's ability to articulate with any precision the experiences and feelings of more marginalized people. But does this negate the value of trying to convey those experiences or of attempting to evoke empathetic responses? Can an understanding of the minute particulars instilled with poetic passion and license help animals find a voice? Buell would answer yes; that despite its "unavoid- able excesses," to ban the pathetic fallacy would be worse (218). So this brings us to our work with students and with the messages that are not heard in schools- consistently- about the lives of animals; about the paradox of our vision and treatment of them. And to the ways in which we might help students imagine the individual lives that animals live. I think of the efforts that are made over and over in the autobio- graphical and biographical urge of so many writers- an urge designed to convey the hardship, triumph, and worth of individual experiences, and of the impact they have on readers and on those who see films and television programs about these lives. In 1999, several conferences or sections of conferences advertised in Lingua Franca called for papers that were devoted to the lives of animals; one in particular exploring why writing from animals' points of view is important to humane change. Might we explore with students, as a central metaphor of our learning, why we only hear certain stories and not others about our attitudes and treatment of animals? Why do we not investigate through our material culture, the traces and implications of our separation from and dominance of nature and animals, both domestic and wild? How is it that these images are so conflicted and ambivalent, yet are at the center of our nostalgic yearnings? That while we yearn for the return to an idealized and pure existence, we participate wittingly and unwittingly in its destruction? Can we bring to the center of curricula and pedagogy an interdisciplinary approach to ecology that uses the interlocking web of nature as a model? Can we reach to the margins to bring in discourses and material culture to make our classrooms, schools, and school systems places that encourage consideration of alternative practice and philosophy? If we begin by looking closely at animal practices in schools- eating meat, keeping classroom pets confined for amusement, for learning responsibility, for scientific observation, or for illustrating a stage in development where humans used to be but have since transcended- we</page><page sequence="19">Vicky Newman 89 can begin to see how these practices produce a destructive way of thinking about animals and our relationship to them. We can continue looking at our choices of school activities that involve animals, for example, trips to the zoo that reinforce the anthropocentric hierarchy and our objectifica- tion of animals; and eating meat with its hierarchical assumptions normalized by extensive and complex discourse and practice bolstered and promoted endlessly by the meat industry, advertising and popular culture. So what of the perversion of Chris P. Carrot? Is this a sign of hysteria? Should we dismiss this kind of activity and mind set as hysterical? Or should we embrace the hysteria as a sign of a profound disconnect, as a cry from the margins that asks us to look at the paradoxes and to interrogate them; to pursue the nature of thought and practice in a way that includes ecological roots of mind and that brings together our empathy with the marvelous particulars of the lives of animals.
