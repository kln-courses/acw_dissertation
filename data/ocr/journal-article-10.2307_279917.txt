<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTS TOAD SPAWN SYMBOLISM SUGGESTED FOR SECHIN Wolfgang Wickler and Uta Seibt Stone engravings from Sechin, hitherto interpreted as human eyes, are reinterpreted as anuran eggs. The reasons for this interpretation and the possible symbolic meaning of such eggs are given. Sechin is a unique archaeological monument in the desert region of northern coastal Peru, 5 km from Casma in the Casma Valley. It dates back to about 1500 B.C. (Jennings 1978; Mason 1975). The main (temple?) complex is formed by a square of stone walls, 50 m x 50 m. Its back wall is still hidden in a hill slope. The three visible walls, now reconstructed, are of monolithic stones, engraved on their flat outer side with outlines of human figures. They show some well-dressed warriors among many dead or dismembered human beings, presumably prisoners and obviously victims of some cruel rite. Blood is shown to flow from all kinds of wounds; there are isolated limbs, heads, bones, and intestines. According to Jimenez Borja and Samaniego Roman (1973) these walls belong to a ceremonial monument and tell a story of human sacrifices connected to a fertility rite. Blood had to be shed to fertilize the always-thirsty soil. We visited Sechin in March 1979. As zoologists we wondered about a special pattern, engraved on several monoliths (Figure 1, left) and interpreted by archaeologists as strings of enucleated human eyes ("Rosario de ojos enucleados" [Jimenez Borja and Samaniego Roman 19731; "disem- bodied eyes" [Roe 19741). We question this interpretation and will substantiate our doubts and of- fer an alternative interpretation. Why Not Eyes? Our main argument is that these objects in this particular arrangement are not convincingly eyelike. Further, we do not believe the portrayed objects to be of human origin. That they should be human seems to be suggested merely by the fact that most of the other easily identifiable organs are clearly human. But such representations of human eye strings would be exceptional, because the other parts of human bodies are shown in realistic form and in numbers and combina- tions per monolith as they would occur on a single person (e.g., two arms, two legs). No exception to this are four to five vertebrae on top of each other as part of a vertebral column. The only ex- ceptions are two heads or two pelvic bones (?) together, and, as a special ornamental arrange- ment, six pairs of identical faces. Other organs do not occur in greater numbers; the eyelike oWb- jects number more than 50 on one stone plate. Further, there are no indications that smaller parts of the body (like fingers, nose, ears) have been cut off. Ears may look damaged but are identical in victims and warriors. Eyes in situ are shown in different ways (Figure 1, right): closed as if dead or sleeping, partly covered by some head adornment (warriors only, not shown in our Figure), or open. Only one version (second from top in Figure 1) resembles the objects on the strings. Moreover, soft parts like stomach and in- testines, if removed from the body, are shown as they would appear when lying somewhere and seen from above (the stone surface representing the horizontal plane). Even if fresh eyes had been removed, they could not have been strung up; they would loose their fluid, collapse, and shrink to forms different from those shown. An Alternative Interpretation We have stressed elsewhere that correct identification of portrayed objects may be crucial for further inferences about the artist's intentions (Wickler and Seibt 1979).

These eggs contain a solid yolk ball in- side a transparent globular jelly mass. The eggs are connected by the jelly in single file to form long strings, exactly as shown on the monolith. A single egg is small (less than 5 mm in diameter), but the strings are rather conspicuous. Several zoologists to whom we showed this picture without further information also promptly identified the pattern as toad spawn. At Cerro Sechin there is an earlier temple, built before the stone-walled complex was con- structed, with clay reliefs of fish or anthropomorphic fish. No other monument at Cerro Sechin has either animals or animal parts represented. However, no fish produces strings of eggs. The Semantic Aspect We know of no reason why eyes should have been strung together like beads. But if the inter- pretation of the monument as connected to a fertility rite is correct, there may have been a good reason why toad eggs should have been portrayed here. 442 [Vol. 47, No. 2,1982]</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTS Even today, anurans rarely fail to catch human attention during their brief reproductive period. In arid regions this period is initiated by rainfall; in temperate regions, by the annual temperature rise. Local mass wanderings of anurans to spawning ponds have been known to become a traffic hazard, and tunnels have even been built beneath highways in an attempt to save the lives of both toads and drivers. Though many anuran species are cryptic or nocturnal or both, their striking vocalizations can make them conspicuous. Savannah species are especially noisy (compared to species in humid forest areas). Their lower pitched calls are adapted to cover considerable distances, 1 to 2 km in some savannah toads. Griffin and Hopkins (1974) recorded frog choruses from small ponds at altitudes up to 500 m, and as much as over 900 m on especially favorable nights. (These sounds may become orientation aids for migrating birds.) The arousal value of this noise for human ears should be assessed in areas where technical background noise is lacking-where there are no cars, generators, other motors, and not even distant airplanes. For civilized man it becomes more and more difficult to imagine the importance of natural sounds for ancient people. Calling, in anurans, is strictly bound to reproduction, and this in turn depends on water. For the field-worker it is very impressive to experience how promptly even small rainfalls are acknowledged by dawn choruses of frogs and toads. These conspicuous sounds could not be por- trayed; their originators could have been, but their spawn as visible proof of fertility may have provided an even better symbol, linked to water and fertilization by nature herself. A possible candidate species for egg strings in the coastal area of Peru is the large Aga toad, Bufo marinus. It is widely distributed over South America and well known for the extreme loudness of the male's voice. It utters a low rattling trill that may continue for over a minute (Duellman 1978). The eggs are deposited in shallow pools in direct sunlight, preferably in slightly brackish water which is available near the coast. Eggs form long strings. One female may spawn 10,000 eggs per spawn, and 35,000 eggs per spawning season. Larvae may hatch in less than 3 days and metamorphose to tiny toads within 6 weeks. Toads have been connected to fertility in various mythical ways through the centuries and in different parts of the world. The uterus has in old times been identified as a toad moving up and down within the female human body (Hansmann and Kriss-Rettenbeck 1966). In South America adult frogs and toads, as well as tadpoles and eggs, can be found painted or modeled on Nazca and Moche pottery. In addition to fertility, another aspect that seems to be represented by anuran pictures is the poisonousness of some species, in particuar, of dendrobatids, the so-called poison arrow frogs (which do not produce strings of eggs, however). The different poisons of anurans (Habermehl 1976) can be useful or dangerous to man and are employed in various ways. Even the spawn of some species, including the Aga toad, is highly poisonous and sometimes causes death to Indian children (described in Biocca [1970:851). But for Cerro Sechin, a poison symbol (even if poison should have been used as a drug) seems less reasonable to us than a fertility symbol. If toads in that area and at that time had a definite spawning season, the toad spawn picture, in- stead of symbolizing the mythic reason for killing people, could as well stand to indicate the time when this happened (e.g., during the month in which toads spawn). Both messages could combine, if human sacrifices occurred to renew fertilization of the soil in dry years when toads failed to spawn. In a very simplified drawing, eyes and anuran eggs are hard to distinguish. Sometimes the similarity may even be intended. But for the reasons given, we feel that it may be worthwhile to consider both possibilities when interpreting this and related types of artwork. REFERENCES CITED Biocca, Ettore (editor) 1970 Yano6ma.
