INTRODUCTION A. General THIs study' deals with one feature of the syntax of nominal forms in the Aramaic book of Genesis in the Targum MS Vatican Neofiti 1,2 the predicate adjective. One of the most common occurrences of the absolute state of nominal forms in this manuscript is as the predicate adjective. However, descriptions of this feature, like many questions in Aramaic syntax, have been passing and superficial at best.3 The standard description of this feature states that when an adjective is used predicatively in Aramaic it agrees with the subject of the sentence in number and gender but not in respect to case-in this respect, the predicate always appears in the "status absolutus." However, no account has yet been given of the relationship between nominal sentences of the form Subject-Predicate and those of the form Predicate-Subject. Is this variation random? Or is it stylistic? Under what conditions does the pronominal copula appear? In the Targum MS Vatican Neofiti 1, as we shall see, there is a significant variation in usage between nominal sentences in which the predicate is fronted and those in which the predicate follows the subject. It is suggested that such * I wish to thank Professor Stephen Kaufman of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Reli- gion and Professors Reuben Ahroni and Yehiel Hayon of The Ohio State University for reading and commenting upon an earlier draft of this paper. I This study is the second dealing with nominal syntax in the manuscript. The first was "Nominal Syntax in the Language of Codex Vatican Neofiti 1: The Genitive Relationship," JA OS 102 (1982): 297- 308. 2 The editio princeps is by A. Diez Macho, Neo- phvyti 1: Targum Palestinense (Madrid-Barcelona, 1968-78). A bibliography of recent works can be found in the introductory section of the last volume, vol. 5, Deuteronimio, pp. 26*-40*. 3 The standard reference grammar for "Jewish" Aramaic remains G. Dalman, Grammatik des jiidisch-paldistinischen Aramdisch (Leipzig, 1894), but, as Kutscher pointed out 20 years ago ("Studies in Galilean Aramaic," Tarbiz 21 [1961]: 192), the volume suffers from serious defects and flaws, not the least of which is the fact that Dalman lumped the language of the Palestinian Targum together with that of the Palestinian Talmud and Midrashim and with that of Onkelos. The volume is, at best, exceedingly difficult to work with, especially so as it entirely lacks a section on syntax. In spite of Kutscher's studies, or perhaps because of them, a modern, thorough grammar of "Galilean" Aramaic still remains a scholarly desideratum. It is hoped that such studies as this present one will form a basis for a better understanding of the language until such time as a good, synthetic grammar does appear. One thing that does seem clear is that studies based on individual manuscripts will enable conclusions to be more tightly drawn. Kutscher's insistence on reliable texts demonstrates the need to understand thoroughly a particular MS idiom before general statements on the nature of a particular "dialect" of Aramaic can be formulated. This is even more the case when one wishes to discuss a concept such as the language of "the Palestinian Targum," without first being able to appreciate the relation- ships between the various surviving representatives of the Palestinian targumic tradition.

B. Sentences in Which an Adjectival Predicate Occurs The predicate adjective occurs in two kinds of situations in this manuscript, depending on whether the subject of the sentence is a nominal or a verbal form. a) The subject of the sentence is a nominal. i) One set of these sentences contains nominal forms such as common or proper nouns, relative pronouns, or a demonstrative/interrogative pronoun. ii) A special set of the above is the group of sentences in which the subject is a personal pronoun. b) The subject of the sentence is contained in a verb, usually a form of the verb hwh, 'to be'. Each of these sets will be examined below. Section II discusses sentences with a nominal subject; section III deals with sentences with a pronominal subject; and section IV contains a discussion of sentences with a predicate adjective, the subject of which is contained in a verbal form, usually part of the verb hwh, 'to be'. First, however, a brief discussion on word order is needed. C. General Word Order in the Targum In analyzing any targumic data, one is always faced with the problem of word order. Since a Targum, by definition, is based on a Hebrew original text, any given passage may constitute a direct translation of the Hebrew, and hence may directly mimic the Hebrew word order. On a more subtle level, the "translator" may be consciously imitating a particular Hebrew idiom or expression, and this may have the effect of "Hebraizing" the word order for a specific literary or theological effect. This is especially the case when one finds incorporated in the "translation" an idiom that has particular theological import.4 Such examples are rife throughout targumic language, and the degree to which such "influences" are recognized invariably depends on the skill of the researcher and his familiarity with the language.5 Nevertheless, one can attempt to describe targumic language, in part by taking account of the subtle nature of the Targum and in part by distinguishing different levels of translation.6 This study will focus on two principal kinds of text: passages where there is no Hebrew base text, i.e., midrashic passages and passages that constitute a paraphrastic expansion of a Hebrew Vorlage. Where necessary, simple 4See also the discussion below on sentence 36, for example. One cannot seek a purely linguistic explanation for the decision of the "translator" to translate t6h in Genesis I in one place by Aramaic th and in the rest of the occurrences by Ipr wtqn. 5 While it is not intended primarily as a linguistic analysis, the excellent monograph by Moses Aber- bach and Bernard Grossfeld (Targumn Onkelos on Genesis 49, Society of Biblical Literature Aramaic Studies I [Missoula, Montana, 1976]) is an example of the in-depth, multi-disciplinary approach neces- sary to understand the many-faceted targumic text. 6 The distinction between simple translated pas- sages and midrashic passages is one kind of distinc- tion. However, one must also look to those passages where there is some kind of deviation, no matter how slight, from the Hebrew original (see Aberbach and Grossfeld, Targurn Onkelos, n. 5), since para- phrases such as these often yield insights concerning the nature of the language used in exegetical expan- sions.</page><page sequence="3">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1 183 translation passages have also been cited, and in all cases where there is a Masoretic base, it is given in parentheses following the citation. a) Verbal Sentences When one examines expanded passages, one notes that in simple declarative sentences containing a verb, the dominant word order in this MS is Subject-Verb- Object (SVO); cf. sentences 1 and 2. 1. tmr npqt Imtwqdh, 'Tamar went forth to be burnt' (38.25). 2. hm`h nsyn 't'bdw Cm bwnn y qb, 'five miracles were worked for our father Jacob' (28.10). This is also the case in modal sentences, as in the imperative in sentence 3. 3. 'twn hmwn trtyn yhydyyn db lmy, 'come, see two singular persons who are in my world' (22.10). One also notes a less frequent secondary word order of VSO, as in examples 4 and 5.7 4. ?mc YYY ql slwth, 'the Lord has heard the sound of her prayer' (38.25). 5. qm yhwdh 'I rglwy, 'Judah arose on his feet' (38.25). b) Nominal Sentences In nominal sentences, too, the dominant word order is subject first, as in sentences 6 and 7 (no Vorlage), 8 (paraphrase), 9 and 10 (direct translation). 6. cwbdyhwn by'yn, 'their deeds are evil' (6.3). 7. hw' im rwbh, 'he is the great Shem' (14.18). 8. 'ynwn bsr, 'they are flesh' (hn bals'ir) (6.3). 9. `ynwn gybryD, 'they are the mighty men' (himma haggibborim) (6.4). 10. qrtD hdh qrybh, 'this city is close' (hC'ir hazzot qar5ba) (19.20). However, there is also a body of nominal sentences in which the predicate is fronted, and these all contain a pronominal copy, acting (more or less) as a copula. These are the examples in sentences 11, 12, 13, 14, and they will be discussed in detail below (section II.B). 11. zk ~h hyD tmr klty myny hy m Cbrh, 'Tamar my daughter-in-law is innocent; by me is she with child' (38.25).8 7 The question of what constitutes "dominant" and "secondary" word order is a thorny one, es- pecially as regards an ancient language preserved in a very specific kind of religious text. As indicated above, the problem of the relation of the Aramaic to the Hebrew Vorlage is one that must be con- fronted (and probably one to which there is no one satisfactory solution). But even in contexts that appear to be unrelated to a Hebrew base text (and discounting for the moment the possiblity of inten- tional mimicking of a Hebrew word order), the motivations for the use of VSO word order as opposed to SVO are obscure at best. It is often a subjective feeling on the part of the researcher that one word order is "dominant," and even if this were to be resolved on a purely statistical basis, the subtleties involved in the conscious change of word order are mostly irretrievable in an ancient text. For the purposes of this discussion, the basic statement of Joseph H. Greenberg ("Some Universals of Gram- mar with Particular Reference to the Order of Meaningful Elements" in Joseph H. Greenberg, ed., Universals of Language (Cambridge, Mass., 1963), that "languages have several variant orders but a single dominant one" (p. 76) is taken as a non- judgmental given. 8 The translations in sentences 11-14 are taken from the English translation in the editio princeps prepared by Martin McNamara and Michael Maher (see n. 2 above). Sentence 11 is to be found on p. 604, sentence 12 on p. 505, sentence 13 on p. 571, and sentence 14 on p. 578.</page><page sequence="4">184 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 12. tb hy ' wrytL plhy [sic] bc/lm hdyn hyk pyry 'yln h.yy', 'the Law is good for those who serve it in this world just like the fruits of the tree of life' (3.24). 13.

Would you (also) take away the mandrakes of my son?' (hamacat qaht k et- fgi waldqahat gam i et-dfidd'd bani) (30.15). The following analysis will focus on predicate adjectives in nominal sentences (sections II and III). Finally, those verbal sentences that contain a predicate adjective (mostly used with a form of the verb 'to be') will be examined briefly in section IV. II. NOMINAL SUBJECT A. Simple Nominal Sentences All three possibilities are attested, i.e., examples with no Masoretic Vorlage (15), examples with Vorlage (16, 17), and paraphrastic examples (18). As can be seen from a comparision of 17 and 18, the state of the Aramaic noun, when there is a Hebrew base text, will depend on whether or not the Hebrew noun it translates is definite. 15. cwbdyhwn b y'yn, 'their deeds are evil' (6.3). 16. dhbD d'rcD hhy tb, 'the gold of that land is good' (zahab hdadres hahPi t6b) (2. 12). 17. qrt" hdh qrybh, 'this city is close' (hdier hazzdt qarbad) (19.20). 18. bh'ryyn mlyyn hmr, 'wells full of pitch' (be"'rat himdr) (14.10). In all these cases, the subject is in first position, and the predicate follows directly. It is important to note that there are no examples of the type Subject-"Copula"- Predicate, i.e., sentences such as 19 or 20 are not found in this MS. 19. * cwbdyhwn Dynwn bdy-yn. 20. *qrtD hdh hy qrvbh. B. Cleft Sentences Compared to sentences 15-18, where the order is SP, sentences 11-14 cited above (section I.C) are of special interest. In these cases, one of the third person personal pronouns follows the fronted predicate as a "pronominal anticipation" of the subject. In these sentences, the order is inverted, and we find Predicate-Pronominal Anticipation- Subject (PAS). It is suggested here that these sentences be interpreted as "cleft sentences," a syntactic device familiar from other Aramaic dialects (and other Semitic languages) and one whose specific function is to highlight the predicate by preposing it.io 9 The text reads ybrwhhv dbry, presumably a copyist error of homoieteleuton for ybrwhwy dbrv, as later in the same verse. l0 H. J. Polotsky, Etudes de svntaxe copte (Cairo, 1944) (reprinted in his Collected Papers [Jerusalem, 1971], pp. 102-202), discusses the "phrase coup6e" at length, see esp. pp. 53-68 (157-72) (cited also, with some additional bibliography, by Gideon Goldenberg, "Tautological Infinitive," Israel Orien- tal Studies 1 [1971]: 36-85, esp. p. 50). Polotsky distinguishes two kinds of cleft sentence, "la pro- position substantive" ("it is rarely that opportunity</page><page sequence="5">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1 185 In defining the cleft sentence, Goldenberg claims that it forms "the 'logical predicate' into a predicate of a nominal, or a copular, sentence, the rest of the utterance being nominalized so as to become the subject of that nominal, or copular, sentence."" As regards nominal sentencesl2 found in Neofiti, this is still a suitable definition: in a sentence such as zk Dh hy D tmr, 'it is innocent that Tamar is', the logical predicate zk Dh, 'innocent', is made the predicate of a nominal sentence zk 'h hyD, 'she is innocent'; and the rest of the utterance, tmr, 'Tamar', is "nominalized" (i.e., in this context, remains unchanged) as the subject of the sentence. It should be noted that there is a difference, in meaning as well as in form, between this sentence and the simple declarative tmr zk'h, 'Tamar is innocent'. In particular, these sentences must be viewed in the larger context in which they appear. When the larger discourse unit is analyzed, the motivation for the use of a cleft sentence (and the 'non-natural' logical value thereby attributed to the predicate) is invariably apparent.1 The cleft sentence is familiar, at least in its verbal form, from other Aramaic dialects. Examples from Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic can be found in sentences 21, 22, 23, 24, where the mark of the cleft sentence is the unchangeable idiom hu da.14 21. ydcnn dmtr' mhmt mr hw d't', 'we know that it is because of you, Sir, that the rain has come' (Ta canit 23b). 22. 'n' hwD dqyym ly I ct', 'it is I who is the one for whom the hour is at hand' (Ta anit 21a). 23. Snyh wywr'yh qwdmym lywr'y r"wnh myqdm hw' dqdmy h' 'yk' qly, 'the second (wife) and her heirs take precedence over the heirs of the first (wife). It is precedence that they take, but if there is [some residue], they take' (Katubbot 90b). 24. Synh hwD dl1 h' mykl kly, 'it is sleeping that they would not, but eating they would do' (Yoma 68b). Examples of nominal sentences are not common, but see sentence 25.15 25. mcylh hw' dlykD Dbl yswrD Dyk , 'it is sacrilege that there is not, but prohibition there is' (Macila 8b). The cleft sentence is also known from Syriac,'6 where no da, is expressed; cf. sentences 26 (a tautological infinitive) and 27. returns") and "la proposition adjective" ("it is always the woman that bears the burden"). It is this latter which is represented by sentences 11-14. However, it should be stressed again that these sentences are nominal; no attempt has been made (in this study) to deal with questions of the syntax of verbal sentences. Hence the presence of "proposi- tions substantives" in Neofiti must for the present remain undemonstrated. 11 Goldenberg, "Tautological Infinitive," p. 50. 12 Goldenberg's main concern is with sentences containing a "tautological" infinitive (familiar from the biblical Hebrew "infinitive absolute," or the classical Arabic mqfclu/ mutlaq), and hence he does not treat nominal cleft sentences as such. 13 See Polotsky, Etudes, p. 67. 14 Sentences 23 and 24 are cited from Goldenberg, "Tautological Infinitive," pp. 51 and 53. 15 This is also cited by Goldenberg, ibid., p. 53. 16 One might object to Goldenberg's assertion that the Syriac expression is "halfway between the plain underlying sentence and a genuine cleft sen- tence." The cleft sentence in Syriac, as in Neofiti, is indeed "genuine," even if the subject is not intro- duced by da; this can be seen in Syriac from the negation, which is by an idiomatic I' (h)w', or 1w, and in Neofiti from the fact that only sentences of the form SP or PAS occur, i.e., there is no PS, and hence the variation cannot be explained on ad hoc grounds, but must represent a genuine syntactic feature.</page><page sequence="6">186 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 26. tlyt l' mytt "P mdmk hw dmk ', 'the maid is not dead, but it is (rather) sleeping that she is' (Aphrahat I 396: 1-2).17 27. b ydwhy hw dbrnw symn, 'they lie in the hands of man' (Laws of the Countries 13: 8-9).18 A cleft sentence sets one member of a sentence (the predicate) into relief, as it were. This marking has one obvious result of drawing attention to the preposed element. But, as can be seen from the above examples (especially the Syriac in 26 with /:, 'but rather'), one of its primary functions can be broadly described as contrastive (and even when the contrast is not explicitly expressed, is is implicitly there, as can be seen from sentence 24). Recent work on such syntactic devices as Left-Dislocation and Topicalization gives an interesting insight to this notion of the contrastive nature of cleft sentences, especially since this work deals primarily with discourse units.19 Most of the examples we are examining come from so-called midrashic passages, i.e., long, story-like textual additions that are perhaps the closest thing to a discourse that can be found in an ancient text. Even those examples that are taken from exegetical passages can be understood in terms of discourse units since the difference is generally one of degree, not kind, and one can understand such an explanatory expansion of a holy Hebrew text only in terms of conscious didactic intent. Prince theorizes that such devices as Topicalization are used to signal features of the ORGANIZATION of the discourse. The text is a set of instructions for the construction of a discourse model, and information is added by what she calls 'incrementation', the most common form of which is 'forward incrementation'. Prince hypothesizes that speakers provide clues in their syntactic (and other) choices to the arrangement of the pieces of information. In particular, Topicalization indicates that a CHANGE OF DIRECTION in the incrementation of pieces of information is required. I would suggest that clefting be understood in a similar manner. As a matter of fact, most of the examples discussed here occur towards the end of a midrashic passage; those that do not are to be found towards the beginning. In this case, clefting can be viewed as an isolating feature, one that sets off one piece of information from the rest of the story. This piece is invariably the MAIN POINT or the moral of a particular discourse, and hence it appears to show up as a CONTRAST to the rest of the discourse. It is this kind of contrasting isolation that is seen in sentences 11-14 cited above, which are repeated here for convenience of the discussion. 11. zk'h hy' tmr klty myny hy mcbrh (38.25). This sentence occurs towards the end of a long midrash describing the trial of Tamar,20 who is to be burned for harlotry. The scene builds in intensity, as Tamar's 17 Goldenberg, "Tautological Infinitive," p. 55. 18 Ibid. This is the Kataba danamose da'atrawata, with reference to the edition of F. Nau, Le livre des lois des pays (Paris, 1931) (non vider). Perhaps a more revealing translation would be "it is in the hands of men that they lie." 19 In particular, an as yet unpublished paper by Ellen Prince (University of Pennsylvania) entitled "A Comparison of Left-Dislocation and Topicaliza- tion in Discourse." 20 In the Hebrew, Tamar is brought before Judah to whom she shows the signet, cord, and staff that he left with her; he then acknowledges them, and declares Tamar to be more righteous than he. In the Aramaic, this is transformed into a court scene, with Tamar imploring God's help and Judah con- fessing his sins to 'hyy w ynsv byyty [sic] d'b , 'my brothers and members of my father's household'.</page><page sequence="7">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1 187 prayers to heaven are answered in the form of three witnesses (the signet, cord, and staff) in exchange for three just men who will be her descendants (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah). Her "eyes were enlightened," and she presents these three objects to the court. Judah at once confesses, since "as a man measures, it will be measured to him." Hence, to avoid the fire of the world to come, he shall reveal his evil deeds: first he dipped his brother Joseph's cloak in blood and deceived his father; and now it is being said to him: "To whom this signet, cord, and staff belong," by him is Tamar pregnant. Now the clefting device draws attention to the moral of the story: as regards Tamar, it is innocent that she is. This piece of information is isolated as the main point of the discourse and hence provides the contrast that is so often described as being a part of the nature of cleft sentences: "As regards Tamar my daughter-in-law, she is innocent, and this is so because she is pregnant by me (and hence guiltless)." That this is the main point of the discourse, and hence to be highlighted by this clefting device, is reinforced by the fact that the story then ends abruptly with the anti-climactic addition: br&lt;t&gt; q/l mn .rmy' npqt w'mrt trykwn zkyyn mn qdm YYY hwh ptgrnm!,'A bat qol (divine voice) came forth from heaven and said: you are both innocent; the affair is the doing of the Lord'.21 12. tb hy' ' wrvt Iplhy [sic] bcIlm hdvyn hyk pyry ,yln hyy-v (3.24). This sentence is the last sentence of a long midrash on the Garden of Eden and Gehenna. Each is described, Eden for the just, Gehenna for the wicked: in Eden the just will eat of the Tree of Life, in Gehenna the wicked will be tormented by fire, and this will take place 'I dy P ntrw mswth d'wrytD bc/lm hdyn, 'because they did not observe the precepts of the Law in this world'. The moral of the story is now introduced by a cleft sentence, highlighting the predicate of the sentence. A change of direction is indicated, from one of simple forward incrementation of additional facts about Eden and Gehenna, to one that picks up the theme of (the Torah as) the Tree of Life that was introduced at the beginning of the midrash (and with which the Hebrew verse on which it is based ends): Drwm yl/n dhyyn hy '~wryytt Ik/ mn dlcy bh, 'for it is a Tree of Life that the Law is for all who labor therein'; wntr pqwdvh hwy h.y wqyym kkyln hyy 1 cNlm' dty,'and whoever observes its commandments is going to be alive and enduring like the Tree of Life for the eternity to come'. The midrash then closes with another cleft sentence (sentence 12), which explains the moral of the moral, as it were, i.e., the reason why the Law is the Tree of Life: tbD hyD DwrVyt plhy [sic] bClm/ hdyn hyk pyry vyln h.yy !, 'It is good(ness) that the Law is for those who serve it22 in this world, just like the fruit of the Tree of Life'! 21 Not "they are both just," etc., as the English translation in the editio princeps states (p. 604). Note that the cleft sentence zk h hyC Inir, the main point of the discourse isolated by this syntactic device, is followed by the non-cleft trykwn zkyyn-- that this is anti-climax, and quite possibly a later accretion to the original midrashic tale, is instantly apparent. If this were the main point of the story, then what value would there be in the telling? It is the innocence of Tamar that is the main point of this story, and the dramatic effect of Judah's declar- ation is decidedly reduced by this apologetic after- thought. 22 plhyh presumably should be read for p/lh, i.e.. m.p. participle + f.s. 3d person possessive suffix. /p/ladhah/.</page><page sequence="8">188 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 13. (whmh CVw 'rwm) bySn nwn bnthwn dkncnc'y [sic] b-pwy dyshq bwy (28.8). This sentence too, even though it appears close to a verbatim translation of the Masoretic Vorlage, should be understood as an exegetical translation, since the use of the cleft sentence to isolate the predicate (and not merely preposing the predicate as would be the case were this a straight mimic of the Hebrew) provides the "translator" with the opportunity to comment on the episode. Rebecca, fearing for the life of Jacob, deceives the aging Isaac into sending him away from Esau on the pretext that the Hittite women are not suitable wives. Isaac summons Jacob, blesses him, and sends him off to Padan-Aram. Now Esau has been observing all this and finally "puts two and two together"; he saw the blessing, saw Isaac send Jacob away for the express purpose of finding a wife, saw Jacob obey his father and his mother (vs. 7 wm'c ycqb Plbwy wl'mh w'zl lpdn 'rm). Then verse 8, introduced by whmh Vcw 'rwm, 'then Esau realized that', focuses upon the main point, the reason (according to Esau and the "translator") why Jacob was sent off, but Esau was not-"it was evil that the daughters of the Canaanites were in the sight of his father and of his mother."23 Having finally realized why his two previous wives had not found favor in his parents' sight and why Jacob had been sent off to his relatives, Esau (pathetically) tries to mimic Jacob and does the next best thing-takes a wife from distant relatives, the Ishmaelites. The fact that the Hebrew has a preposed predicate is what enabled (and presumably inspired) the "translator" to translate by the cleft sentence. It must be noted that a verbatim translation was not possible-such sentences as *bysn bnthwn dkn'n'y do not occur in this manuscript. The "translator" could only translate either (1) bnthwn dkncnDy b}yin, or (2) bysn nwn bnthwn dkn'n'D, as he did. The choice of translation (2), while clearly dependent on the Hebrew word order, departs from it in plainly exegetical terms. The cleft sentence introduces a change of direction by isolating the moral of this episode and explains, from Esau's point of view, the set of events that he had witnessed. It also refers back to 26.35, and finally indicates for Esau the cause of his parents' dislike of his wives (although presumably the women were not evil i-n his sight). It may even hint at an ultimate cause for Esau's disinheritance, since the Rabbis would have felt that it was unfitting for a man married to idolators to receive his father's blessing, and hence Jacob's otherwise reprehensible deception of Isaac was justified. 14. h' zcyr hy dc dy nsbt yt b/ly wt bhC- Imysb vt ybrwh&lt;w&gt;y dbry (30.15). The Aramaic indeed both translates and effectively captures the mood of the Hebrew hamacat qahtuk Det-'is'r, and it is this strongly sarcastic Vorlage that enables the Aramaic to utilize the cleft sentence to highlight the adjectival predicate zcyr', 'small thing'. In the Hebrew, Leah's unexpectedly violent outburst appears to come as 23 Earlier, in 26.34-35, the Targum comments on the wives Esau had previously taken, Judith and Bosmath, both Hittites. The Hebrew merely indi- cates the dissatisfaction of Isaac and Rebecca with the two women-wattihavena mr5rat r2ah lavishadq O/ribqa; the Aramaic explains why--whwwn swrhnvn [sic] wmphn rwh wnmghkn bpwlhn' nwkr'h w/' hwvn mqbln ' w/p 1P mn ,s.hq wl mn rbqh, 'and they were stubborn and caused despair of the spirit, and acted obscenely in pagan cultic practices, and they would not accept instruction, neither from Isaac, nor from Rebecca'. This is the nature of the evil-they were haughty, crushing idol worshipers, and the implication is that they had seduced Esau (cf. also Midrash Bereshit Rabba, ad loc.). See sentence 44 below.</page><page sequence="9">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1 189 a shock, both to Rachel and indeed to the reader. The Aramaic "translator" effectively portrays the episode: Reuben brings mandrakes to Leah, his mother, and Rachel asks Leah for some of them. The bitter sarcasm with which she is answered marks a sudden directional change in the incrementation of information. This statement of Leah's immediately becomes the focus of the entire incident: h' zcyr' hy' d',24 'is it an insignificant thing (that you think) that this is; dy nsbt yt b ly, 'having taken my husband'; w't bcy' Imysb yt ybrwh&lt;w&gt;y dbry, 'now do you want to take my son's mandrakes'?! It is this focus that then gives perspective to Rachel's equally bitter reply: bgyn kdn ys'ms' myk blyly' hdyn thwt &lt;y&gt;brwhwy dbryk, 'because of this, let him use you tonight in payment for your son's mandrakes'! (Hebrew Idken yidkab cimmdk hallayld tahat dt dadd'e bank).25 III. PRONOMINAL SUBJECT A. Simple Nominal Sentences Sentences whose subject is a personal pronoun also have dominant word order SP, in which the pronominal subject precedes the nominal predicate. This holds true both for sentences without Vorlage (28) and with Vorlage (29, 30). 28. hw ' bwhwn dbny Cmwnyy, 'he is the father of the sons of the Ammonites' (19.38). 29. hyk qrt' rbt', 'it is the large city' (hi ha'ir haggadOld) (10.12). 30. vynwn gybry , 'they are the mighty men' (himmd haggibborim) (6.4). Similarly, when the predicate is an adjective, the order is SP, cf. 31, 32, and 33. 31. Dvnwn hyybyn, 'they are guilty' (18.21).26 32. hyk mh d n yhydyy bhmy mrwmD, 'just as I am alone in the heavens above' (3.22). 33. whyv qrybh, 'and it is close' (wahP miSadr) (19.20). B. Cleft Sentences The data are admittedly scarce, but there may be a cleft sentence option available in sentences such as these, just as there is for the nominal sentences discussed in section II.B above. In this case, however, there is no pronominal copy, and the cleft option is simply expressed by the preposed predicate, i.e., PS; cf. sentences 34, 35, and 36. However, examples are scarce, and the suggestion that there is a difference between sentences with pronominal subject of the form SP and PS should be taken as tentative. 34. h' zcyr nh wlyt Dnh kmst mn kl hsdy wmn kl qwit. dy cbdt cm Cbdk,'behold I am little and I am not worthy of all the favors and of all the truth (= fidelity) 24 IS the use of z'Cvr here a subtle reference to 29.26 P kgr Irncbd kdn b rcn Imrnytn zcyrt ' qdmyy Irb&lt;rb&gt;nt", 'it is not proper to act thus in our country, to give the younger before the older' (He- brew lo-v?1ase kin bimq6mmnt' Ihtit hassaird lipn? habbakird, with a spelling error Irbbrnt' for Irbrbnt )? 25 The entire passage in the Aramaic (as in the Hebrew, for that matter) can now be seen to be much more strongly sarcastic than is implied by the English translation of McNamara and Maher in the editio princeps: "It is a small thing that you have taken my husband? Would you (also) take away the mandrakes of my son?" 26 Cf. also the discussion on sentence 35 below.</page><page sequence="10">190 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES that you have done with your servant'27 (qdtantf mikkol hahasddim aUmikkol- ha'emet (32.11). In this episode, Jacob is fearful of the approach of his brother Esau, and he prays to the Lord for deliverance: YYY d&amp;mr ly hzwr Plrck wltwldwtk w'wtb lk,28 'Oh Lord, who are saying to me: "Return to your land and to your kindred and I will do you good."' Now the direction of the incrementation of information changes, and the focus moves to the reason for Jacob's distress and for his prayer for deliverance from God. Jacob is z yr in numerous ways: he is the second-born of the twins; he is the less aggressive of the two (his brother is the hunter, the lord of the fields); he is the unfavored one in the eyes of his father Isaac; he is terrified at the approach of his more powerful brother; and, finally, he perceives himself to be unworthy of God's favor. As a consequence, the preposing of the predicate z yr represents the major focal point of the prayer: h' z yr 'nh, 'but it is an insignificant (person) that I am; wlyt 'nh kmst mn kI hsdy', 'and (as a consequence) unworthy of all the favors, etc.', hence (vs. 12) 'Save me, I pray, from the hands of my brother.., because I fear him, lest he come and kill me. . .'. The emphasis in Jacob's prayer is clearly not on the fact that 'I am small and unworthy . ..', but rather on the contrastive fact that 'it is small/ insignificant that I am, and consequently unworthy.. .'. This not only conveys the adversive nature of the conjunction w- on wlyt much more effectively, but also accounts for the use of h', 'but now'. 35. 'ynwn hyybyn w yn b yn m bd ttwbh wmskyyn 'ynwn bnpithwn dim' dlyt cbdyhwn by yy glyyn qdmy h 'ynwn qdmy kdP ydct, 'they are sinners and if they ask to do penance and they expect in their souls that their evil works may not be manifest before me, behold they are before me, as if I did not know them' (18.21).29 The first clause is a statement of fact: 'they are guilty' (referring to the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah). Now come the consequences of that fact: 'now if they intend to do penance, and it is calculating30 that they are doing in their souls that their evil deed will not be revealed before me, then they shall be before me as if I did not recognize (them)'. The focus of attention in the verse is not on their possible penance-that is clearly nothing more than a hypothetical condition-but rather on their more likely conduct, namely, calculating in their souls that this penance would enable them to get away with their evil deeds.3 27 This is the translation of McNamara and Maher in the editio princeps, p. 587. 28 This translates the Hebrew exactly: YHWH hd 'omir Nlay ~ib la' arsakd ^l/amaladtakd wadtibd cimmdk; it is the next phrase qdt6nt? that is the focus in the Aramaic. 29 This is the translation of McNamara and Maher in the editio princeps, pp. 540-41. Even though mskyyn is a participial predicate, and not strictly adjectival, this example is included here for two reasons. First, it is a highly paraphrastic passage, and is parallel to the adjectival predicate hyybyn; second, the word order is PS, whereas that of hyybvn is SP. Consequently, it is the motivation for the preposing of the predicate that is of interest with this sentence. It should be noted that the repetition of the 'vnwn is not required-the sentence could have read well as a series of conjoined clauses: vynwn hyybyn, 'they are guilty'; w'yn bcyn mcbd ttwbh, 'and if they wish to do penance'; wmskvyn bnpsthwn dlm ..., 'and hope in their souls that. . .'. However, this is clearly not how the "translator" understood the Hebrew. 30 Cf., e.g., M. Jastrow, Dictionary of the Tar- gumim (New York, 1975), p. 989, for citations of the use of this verb in the Pacel/DAfcel meaning "to calculate, count, sum up." 31 This explanation nicely accounts for the other- wise unmotivated change from 'ynwn hyybyn to mskyyn ynwn.</page><page sequence="11">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1 191 36. wgly qdm YYY yt nhwr ' rwm .tb hw w'p&lt;rs&gt; mmr' dYYY byn nhwr' Ibyn hs'wk', 'and it was manifest before the Lord that the light was good and the Word of the Lord separated the light from the darkness'32 (wayyar' eljhim 'et- ha'6r kf-to^b wayyabdcl 'ljohim bin hd~6dr abn hahs'j'k) (1.4). This is a particularly instructive example because of the interpretive nature of the Aramaic translation. Firstly, this verse must be considered in the light of the other, similar formula occurring in Genesis 1.10, 1.12, 1.18, 1.21, and 1.25, viz., wayyar' Deo5hm ki t6b, 'and God saw that it was good'. In all these five cases, the object that is seen by God to be good is not expressed, whereas in 1.4 it is 'et-hd'6r, 'the light', that is seen as good. In all the five cases where the Hebrew simply has ki t.6b, it is translated by an interesting idiom, wgly qdm YYY rwm &amp;pr wtqn, 'and it was manifest before the Lord that it was beautiful and good'.33 This is one of many strict translation conventions to be found in targumic material.34 The first chapter of Genesis is a highly technical rabbinic text and was the subject of much speculation and comment. Each word in the Hebrew text was closely examined for what could be gleaned from it concerning the nature of the universe in which humanity finds itself. The Targumim also wrestled with the question of what this text meant, and they present us with a highly interpretive translation. It is with this in mind, then, that we have to consider why the t6b of verse 4 above is not translated by 'pr wtqn. It should be noted that this verse is not an exact translation of the Hebrew, and it is the addition of the hw that is instructive, for this is what turns the sentence into a cleft sentence, as we have understood it above. In addition, the cleft sentence stands at the beginning of the passage, not at the end as we have previously seen.35 This is the focus, both grammatical and theological, of the passage. The information follows the description of the primal chaos, devoid of all living things (vs. 2); then a rwh drhmyn36 from before the Lord blows over the waters; the Word of the Lord decrees light; there was light according to the decree (vs. 3); 'then it became manifest before the Lord-that very light!-that it was good(ness) that it was, and (as a consequence) the word of the Lord separated that light from the darkness' (vs. 4). In 32 This is the translation of McNamara and Maher in the editio princeps, p. 497. 33 Cf. McNamara and Maher's translation, p. 498. I would suggest rather that 'pr wtqn be understood as 'attractive', i.e., looking the way it should, and 'correct', i.e., fashioned the way it should be. Note also that the similar summary phrase in 1.31 that refers to everything that was created wahinne-tdb ma 'd is also translated 'rwm Apr wtqyn lhd', 'that it was very attractive and correct'. 34 Cf. the paper referred to in n. I above for more detail. 35 It should be pointed out that this verse contains another problem as well, namely the fact that the passive participle gly, 'it was revealed', is followed by the direct object yt nhwr', 'the light'. This hap- pens in other places in Neofiti, with enough regu- larity that to assign this to the catchall "scribal error" is probably to mask a serious translation technique. I do not believe that this is only a product of translating each phrase of the sentence in a piecemeal fashion, i.e., wayyar' " elhim had to be translated by wgly qdm YYY in order to avoid anthropomorphism and then 'et-hd'6r was trans- lated by yt nhwr', etc. If this is so, why, we must ask, is ki t6b not translated then by 'rwm tb? Furthermore, there are a sufficient number of counter-examples of an intentional interpretive translation that to invoke the principle of phrase- by-phrase translation to resolve grammatically diffi- cult passages would be to introduce anarchy into one's methodology. Rather, each example such as this must be examined to try to resolve the problem with internally consistent interpretations. In this case, clearly the fact that the Hebrew has 'et-hd'6r is one factor in the "translator's" choice, but to say that it is the only one does not do justice to that "translator's" subtle and artful creations. 36 Well translated by McNamara and Maher as 'a spirit of love'.</page><page sequence="12">192 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES other words, the fact that the light was good is not merely an additional piece of information but the main point of the passage. In contrast to the darkness of the void, which is evil, 'a spirit of love' has brought about change, and the light which is the product of that change is good; hence it was kept and separated from the darkness. The contrast also looks forward, since the other five instances of t6b that follow all refer to physical entities, and they are 'attractive and correctly fashioned'. This understanding of the text also eliminates the need to emend the text, and provides a reasonable resolution of the problem of the direct object following the passive participle. IV. CLAUSES IN WHICH THE SUBJECT IS CONTAINED IN A VERB In this group of sentences (with the possible exception of sentence 49 below), the copula expresses a tense other than the present tense. In these cases, the normal word order is SVP, or where the subject is not expressed other than as part of the verb, VP. All three possibilities are found with sentences of the form SVP, with Masoretic Vorlage, without Vorlage, and paraphrase. Cases where the adjectival predicate does not follow the verb always appear to be mimics of the Hebrew word order, as in sentence 37. 37. nh gbr sdyq Vlm bCbdh tb' hww ([sic] for hwwh) bdrwy, 'Noah was a righteous man, perfect in good work was he in his generation' (nd"h Ibf ' saddTq tdmim hayd badd5r5td(y)w) (6.9). Those verses which translate a form of the Hebrew verb 'to be' are always copied exactly, see sentences 38, 39, and 40. 38. wrhl hwwt y'yh brybww&lt;t&gt;h37 wSpyr' bhzwh, 'and Rachel was attractive in figure and beautiful in appearance' (waradhl hJyatd yapat-t~dJr wfpat marDe) (29.17). 39. hwv. hwh hkym mn kl hyyt', 'the snake was craftier than all the beasts' (hann.haS' hdyd c'dram mikkol hayyat has'asdde) (3.1). 40. (plh qdmy bqit. ) whwh 9lm b Cbd' tb , '(serve before me in truth) and be perfect in good work' (hithallik lapaindy wehaye tamim) (17.1). In those verses in which the Hebrew does not have a form of the verb 'to be' but it is required in the Aramaic to express action in the past or future, it has been supplied in the Aramaic and always in the order (S)VP, as in sentences 41, 42, and 43. 41. gwb hwwh ryq, 'the pit was empty' (habbor req) (37.24). 42. ycqb hwh gbr 'lm bcbdh tb., 'Jacob was a man, perfect in good work' (yacaqob is t am) (25.27). 43. thwy zkyy mm Tbwcty, 'you will be free from my oath' (tinndqe m"adldtf) (24.41). Similarly, where there is no Vorlage, the word order is still (S)VP, as in sentence 44. 44. whwwn swrbnyn, 'and they were rebellious' (26.35). As regards paraphrases using the verb 'to be', there is a small group of four examples with the negative P, two of which use the technical idiom ksir, 'proper', and two the technical idiom tqn, 'correct' (see sentence 36 above). Both sentences 45 and 46 37 The text has brybwwdh, presumably a copyist's aural error for brvbwwth.</page><page sequence="13">NOMINAL SYNTAX IN THE LANGUAGE OF CODEX VATICAN NEOFITI 1 193 expand a similar Hebrew base idiom, the first in connection with the rape of Dinah, the second in connection with marrying the younger daughter before the elder in the Jacob story. 45. kdn I' hwh kir Imt Cbd' 'such a thing was not proper to be done' (kn l' yccas'e) (37.4). 46. P" kir Imcbd kdn, 'it is not proper to do so' (loi'-yicai-e kin) (29.26). In the former, the Hebrew is used modally, with the meaning, 'such a thing should not have been done';38 in the latter, it is an historical present 'such a thing is not done',39 hence the correct translations of each, one with hwh, the other without. Sentence 47 is also negative, and here no form of the verb hwh is used. As such, it is parallel in form to sentence 46 above, even though the predicate translates the Hebrew l6-t6b, 'it is not good' rather than a verb as in 46. Similarly, sentence 48 also translates tdb, 'it is good', by tqn.40 47. 1' tqn yhwy brn Ilblhwdwy, 'it is not good that a man should be alone' (loh-t.6b heydt hd ddam labadd) (2.18). 48. tqn msbh yth lk, 'it is better to marry her off to you' (.6b tittf "otdh 1 ak) (29.19). Finally, there are very few examples of a predicate adjective following a verb other than 'to be'; however, see sentence 49. Here the word order copies the Hebrew, and due to the paucity of examples, it has not been possible to determine whether verbs other than hwh would necessitate other word orders.41 49. hi' kDlw nkryyn Dthgbnn, 'is it not that we have been considered as though we were strangers' (halo' nokriyy6t nehs'abnti) (31.15). V. CONCLUSIONS The foregoing analysis has described the conditions in which the predicate adjective occurs in the Targum Neofiti 1. As expected, it is used primarily in nominal sentences, the subject of which is either a noun or noun equivalent (such as a demonstrative, interrogative, or, more prominently, a personal pronoun). However, there is a small body of examples in which a status absolutus adjective functions as the predicate of a sentence in which the copula is used in either the present or the future tense, and one case with another verb, 'to be considered'. More importantly, however, the regular occurrence of sentences of the form Predicate-"Copula"-Subject has been conclusively demonstrated, and it has been shown that they compete only with nominal sentences of the type Subject-Predicate. There are no nominal sentences of the type Predicate- Subject. 38 riband ya caqb bd iu min-has'ade kas'om am wayyitassab(i h~7anSgim wayyihar lahem ma 'd kT naba1 cld - bayijrdPI ligkdb et-bat-yacaqob wakin lo5 yjCdie, 'And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard, and the men were upset and they were very angry, because he had done an obscene deed in Israel by lying with Jacob's daugh- ter, and such a thing should not have been done' (34.7). 39 wayy6(f)mer laban 153-yCis'e kin bimq6meni lutPt hassactr e lipne habbakird, 'And Laban said: "Such a thing is not done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born"' (29.26). 40 Such forms as t6b, 'it is good', have to be taken in the Semitic languages as predicates, as can be seen from the derived forms h15-t6b, 'it is not good' and hayd tA6b, 'it was good'. 41 Although intuitively one would not necessarily expect this to be the case.</page><page sequence="14">194 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES The study has suggested that the PAS type be understood as representing a cleft- sentence equivalent, and a final word should be said in defense of this suggestion. It is important to note that the function of the cleft sentence in this MS is not primarily to emphasize the predicate, though this is clearly a secondary product. As the study attempted to demonstrate, its use in midrashic passages in key positions indicates that this syntactic feature can also fill a literary function. It has been suggested that this function is to isolate the moral of a particular passage and that this is one of many translation devices employed by the Targumist. For it is important to keep in mind that the function of a Targum is more than merely to provide a "translation" of the Hebrew text. The Targum, far from being a vernacular Aramaic rendering, is a highly technical piece of rabbinic literature. There is structure to this work, literary technique and, above all, translation technique and convention. For the Aramaic translation is an interpretive rendering, and while post-biblical Hebrew was known and used, it clearly would have been inappropriate to interpret the sacred text from one "Hebrew" to another. Aramaic was the language in which this sacred text could be commented upon and manipulated to extract meaning, not the close reading of the Mishnah, wherein the text was scrutinized for truths, hidden or otherwise, but rather the explanation of what the Hebrew text was trying to say. The Targum is the authorized community standard of what the words of the Torah mean-in discussing Zechariah 12: 11 in Meg. 31, R. Joseph comments 'ilmale' targumna' ha'i qra' la' yadacna) ma'i qa'mar, 'if it were not for the Targum of that verse, we would not know what it means'.</page></plain_text>
