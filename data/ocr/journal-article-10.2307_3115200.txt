A German Jewess in the Age of Totalitarianism Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott It is memory and not expectation (the expectation of death as in Heidegger) which gives unity and wholeness to human existence. . . . Remembrance in man discovers the twofold 'before' of human existence. .... This is the reason why the return to one's origin can at the same time be understood as an anticipating reference to one's end.' "Strange Dialectics": Arendt on Caritas and Jewishness How many Hannah Arendts are there? Is she the German Jewish pariah who nonetheless "loved" the world? Is she the twentieth-century literary modernist who, in writing Origins of Totalitarianism, recapitu- lated Augustine's City of God? Is she the unrelenting critic of "con- formism" in bourgeois liberal culture who celebrated American political liberalism? Is she the German-Jewish refugee who accused Adolph Eichmann of philistine banality? Is she the Heideggerian fifth-colum- nist intent on destroying the Western philosophic tradition who wrote her dissertation on St. Augustine's social philosophy? Recently published and still emerging evidence of her earliest writing, together with her already published books, journal articles, reviews and correspondence clearly demonstrate that from the start of her public career in 1929 Arendt presented all of these masks to the public world, often simultaneously. Beginning with her dissertation on St. Augustine's 1.

Augustine was Arendt's "old friend," and the text of the dissertation traveled with her as she escaped from Germany to France in 1933, and left for New York in 1941 with the help of Varian Fry's rescue opera- tion. Augustine, she writes, was aware of the incompatibility between Stoic and Neo-Platonic "radical . . . alienation" which the ordo amoris entails, and the equally authoritative Christian imperative of caritas as love of neighbor. According to Arendt, the problem of how to be a member of a visible, social institution by outward confession and behav- ior while also maintaining the integrity of an inward "order of love," compelled Augustine to confront "the actual problem of how to live in this world."3 Once in New York, Arendt returned to the manuscript, commissioned an English translation and proceeded to revise it, partly by hand and party on her typewriter. The result is an American work, evi- denced by the addition of the terms such as "natality" which she coined in the 1950's for the concepts already present in 1929. The following discussion will examine the origins of the concepts of caritas (as "neigh- borly love") and plurality as central themes in Arendt's early work which influenced later positioning as a Jewish intellectual in America. As Seyla Benhabib, Richard Bernstein, Dagmar Barnouw and Elisa- beth Young-Bruehl and have definitively documented, Arendt's Jewish sensibility was a complex one, forged in the context of social democratic politics and cultural assimilation in the German-Jewish middle class.4 Ironically, however, it was her first foray into social theory via the works of St. Augustine that provided the template for her explorations of the role of what she would variously term the "pariah" or "outsider," includ- ing Jews and Negroes, in twentieth-century public life. That this connec- tion is still controversial in Arendt scholarship is undeniable. Peter Baehr, in The Portable Hannah Arendt, does not include the text because 2. See Scott &amp; Stark. 3.

As the following discussion shows, Arendt's German text became an American one as she revised it in New York. It reflected her lifelong concern with rescuing the possibility of a vantage point for thinking and judgment from the determining givenness of historical context. Another wary approach to Love and Saint Augustine and its relevance to her later work comes from scholars who are dismayed by the Arendt- Heidegger connection. Given the Heideggerian aura which radiates from the surface of Arendt's discussion of the "Creator" and "natality" as sur- rogates for "Being" and "death" in Heidegger's work, some initial cau- tion is understandable. Accordingly, Mark Lilla's "Menage &amp; Trois,"6 based on the newly published correspondence between Arendt and her mentor, explores the various meanings of the "love" between Heidegger, Arendt and Jaspers as, on her part at least, a redemptive evolution from physical desire to Platonic friendship. Because she was a Jewish woman- under-the-influence of a nascent Nazi in the late 1920's, her work from that period is fatally contaminated, according to Lilla. It seems obvious to him that "Love and Saint Augustine" is a title with a double entendre, since it is a "work inspired in more than one sense by her encounter with Heidegger."7 But looking beneath the surface and avoiding the trap of historically determined readings which Arendt herself abhorred, yields a very different result. The dissertation is not an ode to Heidegger, but a respectful declaration of independence both as a thinker and in her "given" identity as a Jew. How many graduate students in the Weimar German academy of the "Mandarins" would have acted so boldly? By the end of the 1940's, Arendt had emigrated to America and inserted herself into a new public arena, the world of the New York Intellectuals. She was a senior editor at Schocken, where she gave Irv- ing Howe his first job as her assistant, sat in on editorial conferences with luminaries such as T. S. Eliot, and arranged for the first English edition of Kafka's Diaries. She published reviews in the "little journals" 5.

Her Jewish background and recent personal history as an escapee from a French detention camp gave Arendt a dra- matic credibility with respect to "the Jewish question." During and after World War II she also wrote frequently for Jewish journals in New York about Jewish affairs in Europe, including the controversy sur- rounding the founding of a Jewish state in Palestine. Arendt was the first of the New York writers to deal directly with the camps and prob- lems of guilt. As a result, her work was widely cited by the New York avant-garde as directly influencing their own work.8 Nevertheless, for Arendt the givenness of her membership in a histori- cal Jewish community did not in itself answer what she would term the Augustinian quaestio ("quaestio mihi factus sum")9 of who she was by choice of her free will as a thinker, as a woman and as a Jew. The prob- lem of vantage point would be a persistent and troubling one for Arendt. When she did not explicitly raise it, her critics obliged. The torrent of abuse which descended upon her after the publication of her "report" on Eichmann's trial in 1961 for The New Yorker and her 1963 "banality" addition to the book-length study, honed in on the apparently lofty posi- tion from which she judged not only the defendant but also his victims. Part of the difficulty stemmed from the fact that the idea of "radi- cal" evil which she had briefly noted in Origins of Totalitarianism,10 was abandoned by the early 1960's as she simultaneously prepared her dissertation on Augustine for publication and her Eichmann report. Arendt was turning her understanding of evil inward to the deformed judgment of the doer of evil, Augustine's natural habitat. For Arendt, the essence of radicalism was instead the positive capacity to engage in fundamental thought. To be evil meant to succumb to thoughtlessness, 8.

It was better characterized nega- tively, by an absence rather than a presence. Augustine's terms consue- tudo or habitus, which meant the behavioral effect of cupiditas [worldly desire], became her point of reference.11 Critics of the Eichmann report and her earlier negative reaction to the forced integration of "Negro" students in Southern schools demanded to know why the clearly evil Eichmann and the clearly unjust history of racial segregation in the South were not portrayed as such by Arendt. They failed to understand the complex and often coded mode of discourse Arendt employed when speaking of her Jewish vantage point and of the problem of discrimina- tion.12 At the radical root of her existenz, and largely unknown to her audiences, lay Arendt's encounter with Augustine. I. Caritas: Radical Love In a famous exchange of letters with Gershom Scholem in 1963, which was published the next year in Encounter, Arendt allowed her- self to be goaded into a direct and uncharacteristic personal statement of her own intellectual stance and its relationship to her Judaism. The orig- inal draft of the letter among her papers in the Library of Congress shows that Arendt framed her response in terms almost directly drawn from the dissertation on Augustine, particularly Part I, Ch. 3 and Part III, which deals with the problem of reconciling what she termed "radi- cal" alienation and social life. Through two drafts of the Scholem letter, the first typed and the next revised in handwriting, she modifies her message to increase the power of its impact. For example, after reproducing an Augustinian observa- tion that "the greatness of this people (the Jews) was that it believed in God and believed in him in such a way that its trust and love of him was greater than its fear of him," she concludes that "in this sense I do not 'love' the Jews, nor do I 'believe' in them; I merely belong by descent and by historical circumstances to this people." The last clause is changed in the final text to "I merely belong to them as a matter of course." Unchanged are her earlier comments that "I have never loved any people or collectivity. . . ." While the first draft says that she 11. Scott &amp; Stark 81-83. 12.

To love the Jews, since she is a Jew, is to love her own factual, historical and concrete existence which, she suggests, is "a rather suspect thing."13 Significantly, in the same context of defining and defending her Jew- ish perspective she shifts venues to the context of thinking, though the drafts of her article excise several more detailed references to the "two- in-one" interchange. The first revision of her original draft reads: What disturbs you is that my arguments and my approach are not conventional. In other words, that I am independent. By this I mean, on the one hand that I do not belong to any organization and speak only for myself. But I also mean that it is important to think these matters out for oneself. And you will not understand my conclusions unless you realize that they are indeed my own conclusions and owe nothing to any outside authority. The second revision changes the term "conventional" to a more per- sonal attack. It is now phrased as ". . . what you. .. have heard all your life." Also added is ". . . thinking is a process . . . between me and myself and ... no ideology, no public opinion and no "convictions" can be a substitute for it .. ." Arendt finally decides on a combination of the two versions: What confuses you is that my arguments and my approach are different from what you are used to; in other words, the trouble is that I am independent. By this I mean that, on the one hand, I do not belong to any organization and always speak only for myself and, on the other hand, that I have great confidence in Lessing's selbstdenken for which, I think, no ideology, no public opinion and no "convictions" can ever be a substitute. Arendt's Jewishness is now a prominent focus among Arendt schol- ars precisely because it was not a factor she herself chose to highlight explicitly in her political thought, other than through metaphors of mod- ernist disengagement. While she coined the phrase "pariah people" to describe Jews in Western history, she did not often apply the term 13. Arendt's drafts of response to Scholem, and final version printed in Commen- tary (Jan. 1967), Library of Congress, Box 47.</page><page sequence="7">Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott 25 pariah directly to her own life situation.14 By the end of the 1940's, she almost never used it with respect to the stance of the thinker in the pub- lic world. Instead, the label she most preferred was that of "radical." Only once and only briefly, in the Preface to the first edition of Ori- gins, had Arendt paired the term radical with negative connotations, in this case the "absolute" and "truly radical nature of Evil" in the final stages of totalitarianism. Instead, Arendt had no hesitations about apply- ing the term with a positive connotation to herself and her new friends among New York writers, artists and critics.15 For example, Arendt insisted on a radical self-definition in response to the exasperated eruption of David Riesman who could not under- stand why she displayed such an "animus against the bourgeois and the liberal." He fumed, "Are you not a liberal ... was Clemenceau not a liberal?" Answering both questions simultaneously, Arendt scribbled in the margins of her response, "No, a radical."l16 What she meant is that she claimed a vantage point in, but not of, the world. She had heard the term in current usage when Heidegger had spoken of the need "to grasp the problem of Being in a more radical way."l17 After emigration, she learned that to be a "radical" was the most common reference point among her New York Intellectual colleagues who wrote for Partisan Review, Commentary and The Nation. Indeed, they could agree on little else besides their deliberately radical, avant-garde vantage point. In 1968, Arendt drafted a retrospective tribute to Dwight Macdonald's "radical," defunct journal, Politics, which had ceased publication in 1949. She had been a close friend of Macdonald for over two decades, and was the source for his famous musings on totalitarianism and the banality of mass culture. In tribute to his radical sensibility Arendt wrote. Politics, which counted so many non-Americans among its contrib- utors was radical in the sense of going back and reviving much that belongs to the very roots of the American tradition as well as much that belongs to the roots of the radical tradition every- where - the tradition of nay-saying and independence, of "cheerful 14.

He writes "Hannah Arendt has recalled, 'George Grosz's cartoons seemed to us not satires but realistic reportage: we knew those types; they were all around us. Should we mount the barricades for that?"'19 It is ironic that in an age of the "new objectivity" in German academic tastes Arendt preferred to learn her politics through what she termed "political expressionism."20 These radical artists and writers, said Hajo Holborn, "wanted a new culture," leading Max Weber to term expressionism a "spiritual narcotic." Gay reports that "survivors" like Arendt, Holborn and Neumann were convinced "the end had come." Neumann recalled that, "The German intellectual's state of mind . . . was, long before 1933, one of skepticism and despair, bordering on cynicism."21 What was "in the air" at Heidelberg also provides the atmospheric con- text for her dissertation. From the outset of her academic career Arendt was also attracted to Christian existentialism, not as a personal theologi- cal alternative but as an intellectual terrain. Augustine, particularly, told a story of pilgrim souls acting both as citizens and as Christians in a world doomed to destruction. The pilgrim was more than a pariah frozen in the margins of social life without recourse. Indeed, a "radical" pilgrim could choose not to be irrelevant and also could choose not to be a (philistine) parvenu in "love" with the historical, givenness of the world. In her years of independent study at the University of Berlin, where she passed examinations for the Arbitur in 1924, Arendt studied Greek and Latin and also took classes from Romano Guardini, a prominent purveyor of Christian existentialism. Guardini led her to the works of Kierkegaard and to a decision to major in theology when she entered university. She had already read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone at the age of sixteen and, by 1922, had also consumed Karl Jasper's Psychology of World 18.

But it was to be Heidegger's lectures on the problematic of worldliness which funda- mentally reoriented Arendt's approach to thinking. Arendt's exposure to both Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology gave her the intellec- tual tools she needed to proceed with Augustine's caritas as her first major foray into what her friend Walter Benjamin would call the "alchemy" of bridging past and present. Arendt recalls German stu- dents' receptivity to the "rebellious element" in Heidegger's teachings, and in Jaspers's as well. She describes, with distant hindsight, a rebel- lion against the "schools," "circles," "world views" and their "parti- sans" which dominated university life in Weimar. Philosophy was not "rigorous science," in her opinion, despite all the "academic talk about philosophy," because it failed to distinguish "between an object of scholarship and a matter of thought." Within the discipline both the new "schools" - neo-Kantians, neo-Hegelians, neo-Platonists - and the old specialties - epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, logic - seemed to have "drowned in an ocean of boredom."23 When Arendt encountered Heidegger in Marburg, he had already been deeply immersed in theological concerns as he moved away from his spe- cifically Catholic heritage to a philosophical concern with "primal Chris- tianity." In a letter to Karl Lowith in 1921 he labeled himself a "Christian theologian," and told his students that Dilthey, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel "came out of theology and take from it the basic principles of their speculation."24 His, like theirs, was a "formalizing detheologization" of Christian religious language and experience. In exploring Heidegger's earliest teaching and writing, John van Buren notes that his fame spread rapidly in the 1920's not only as a philosopher as such, but also as a Luther scholar. "Heidegger's teaching and publications in the twenties had a tremendous impact on the course of German Protestant theology in such figures as Bultmann, Paul Tillich and Heinrich Ott."25 Also in 1921, Heidegger gave a lecture course on "Augustine and Neo-Platonism," which juxtaposed Augustine's sense of New Testament historical root- edness and Neo-Platonic abstract realism. His focus appears to have 22. Young-Bruehl 33-36. 23.

Another seminar on August- ine was planned for 1924 but never given. By 1927 when Arendt had encountered the "hidden king" personally and professionally he was immersed in Being and Time. Though he continued collaborations with Bultmann, Heidegger had begun to "dis- tance himself from his project of a phenomenology of religion."26 Arendt, however, took him up on the challenge of fashioning a philoso- phy which is "atheistic in principle" but focused on the "radical self- supporting questionableness [of Being]" inherent in Christianity and in all religious experience.27 Arendt fled the inertia of ennui and irrelevance to find safe haven among the artists, writers, theologians, phenomenologists, and sociolo- gists who constituted the radical culture of the period. Indeed, for her the "rumor" of Heidegger's rebellion came at precisely the right moment. Those drowning in boredom were also seized by an anxiety about "the breakdown of tradition and the 'dark times' which had set in.. ." Heideg- ger and the radical theorists seemed to promise a way out. Precisely because "the thread of the tradition was broken" it was possible to "dis- cover. .. the past anew."28 Arendt's rediscovery of Augustine was part of her journey of anti-traditional thought. Her own particular pilgrim's path, however, led beyond Husserl's destination of "the things themselves" to the question of the relationship between thought and social life and, par- ticularly, "the relevance of the neighbor." Passionately engaged in the cul- tural ferment surrounding her, Arendt found her own voice as a radical public intellectual. She wrote an influential book review of Karl Man- nheim's Ideology and Utopia for Die Gessellschaft (1930) and an article on Soren Kierkegaard for Frankfurter Zeitung (1932). In 1930, also in Frankfurter Zeitung, she transposed her Augustinian studies to the format of popular journalism for an article on the relationship between August- ine and Lutheran Protestantism. Simultaneously during this period she also worked on her study of Rahel Varnhagen and, in a guarded way, identified with Zionist causes and Kurt Blumenfeld. The Varnhagen study which she termed a "structured montage," superimposed her Augustinian paradigm of the Christian pilgrim's progress on the odyssey of an assimi- lated Jew at the turn of the nineteenth century. 26. van Buren 156. 27. van Buren 153. 28. Arendt, The Jew as Pariah 295.</page><page sequence="11">Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott 29 In the dissertation, both in its original form and in her revised English translation of the early 1960's, Arendt sets about transforming the "Being" of Heideggerian phenomenology into a "Creator" by resurrect- ing the Augustinian paradigm which Heidegger had set aside. She pairs mortality with "natality," adding the term itself during her early 1960s revisions in order to name the phenomenon already present in the 1929 text.29 The death-driven, worldly "love" entailed in Augustine's cupidi- tas is set against caritas as "love of neighbor" which preserves both plu- rality and community. In 1929, Heidegger's "clearing" merges with Augustine's "nunc stans" to create a spiritual terrain for the radical pilgrim. By the 1960s Augustinian tropes merge with her American project of articulating both a pre-political realm of cultural conversation and a specifically political public world of action. Arendt's existential "space" provides the thinker, or the Jew as radical pilgrim, with a sheltering vantage point. In her political thought this terrain becomes the man-made public world of word and deed. While only addressed by implication in her German works of the late 1920s and early 1930s, the distinction between delib- erately chosen or mutually constructed communities, on the one hand, and given social institutions and mores, on the other hand, would become a crucial one for Arendt. In her American works after 1941 the historical, worldly space of modernity is more often depicted as a "desert" and an "abyss," ani- mated by thoughtlessness and violence - except when speaking of the American republic at its founding. Precisely because Augustine dis- played afin-de-sikcle sensibility, his bittersweet odes to a dying Roman civilization eerily resonated with her own sense of Weimar's and Europe's, decline. His Roman academic pedants were her "schools." His corrupt, materialistic and power-obsessed Imperial politicians were her Weimar liberals. Virgil, who had been Dante's guide through the underworld, was also Augustine's and Arendt's. In a sense, just as Augustine rewrote the Aeneid as The City of God, Arendt would rewrite The City of God as The Origins of Totalitarianism. Once in America, Arendt gave the negative space of civilization's crisis a precise temporal location. She speaks of an "empty space" in the Western tradition resulting from the "catastrophe" of Europe from 1914 to the end of World War II. As early as 1946, in The Nation 29.

In the dissertation, however, "past and future negations are not the same." A focus on death leads to a state of anxiety and nothingness, while pursuing the future, either as happiness or death, paradoxically results in a return to the past source of Being, as well as a glimpse of a future eternity. Arendt locates the encounter between the "no more" and the "not yet" in the "space" of the of the timeless present, which she also labels as "memory."31 Arendt writes that "it is the function of memory to 'present' (make present) the past and deprive the past of its definitively bygone character. Memory undoes the past." The result is that "memory transforms the past into a future possibility." Memory in Augustine's writings, is a process of "collecting myself from dispersion" in the unmastered past. It presupposes an order and meaning which "lies before every specific past - that is, toward the origin of human existence as such."3 Indeed, this search for origins is the search for a Creator. Rising gradually to "Him who made me," Augustine arrives at "the vast camps of memory." There he finds the notion of the "happy life" which is his origin and as such the quintessence of his being. The absolute future turns out to be the ultimate past, and the way to reach it is through remembrance.33 Arendt's Broch review transforms the nunc stans, materializing it on the blasted minefields of World War. The search for a Creator takes on the agonized quest for meaning in the modem world. The title, "No Longer and Not Yet," is one of her many metaphors for the "space" borrowed from the dissertation. But in the 1940s a negative valence predominates. 30. Hannah Arendt, "Hermann Broch's 'Death of Vergil'," The Nation 163 (14 Sept. 1946): 301-02. 31. Scott &amp; Stark 70-76, 117, 135, 140-44. 32.

The chain is broken and an empty space, a kind of historical no man's land, comes to the surface which can only be described in terms of the "no longer and the not yet." In Europe such an abso- lute interruption occurred during and after the first World War. In the same year, Arendt transferred the themes of her dissertation to another article for a prestigious New York journal, Partisan Review. The occasion was the answer to her own Augustine-like quaestio, "What is the Existenz?" It afforded Arendt the opportunity to declare her grow- ing independence from Heidegger and her admiration for Jaspers's thoughts on the potential for human freedom. In doing so, she again returns to her dissertation, substituting the Existenz for Augustinian cari- tas, and retaining the social context which she felt was crucial for both. Existenz is never essentially isolated. ... One's fellow men are not (as in Heidegger) an element which, though structurally necessary, nevertheless destroy Existenz; but, on the contrary, Existenz can develop only in the togetherness of men in the common given world . . . a new concept of humanity as the condition for man's Existenz. In any case, men move together within this "surround- ing" Being; and they hunt neither the phantom of the Self nor do they live in the arrogant illusion that they can be Being generally.34 In the dissertation, the term societas retains its neutral Latin implica- tions, rather than those of the "social realm" of modernity which she later so thoroughly rejected. Societas is not the locus of capitalist trans- actions, parvenu culture or the state regulation. Neither is it the primor- dial organic community derived from German romanticism. Later, in The Human Condition, Arendt goes into much greater detail on the lin- guistic origins of societas and its relation to communitas. However, in both settings the given, historical world provides the challenge to which individuals must respond. The mode of response varies with the con- texts of Arendt's inquiries: the Augustinian mode of withdrawal and reentry for the evangelistic purpose of moral exhortation, the isolation and alienation of the Jews as a pariah people; or the secular mode of constituting new social spaces which her favorite sociologist, Toc- queville, wrote about in nineteenth-century America. These forms of social bonding are not primarily "worldly" in the dissertation's sense of 34. Arendt, "What Is the Existenz?"

They are, instead, what Arendt termed pre-political.35 Arendt critiqued Augustine's struggle with Neo-Platonism's "regula- tory" notion of love.36 Desire for spiritual self-sufficiency sustained by a transcendent source, she argued, forces Augustine into a position which reduces persons and the man-made world to mere occasions for the exercise of good works. This is not a result which satisfied him or her. Arendt writes that his ordo amoris [order of love] has "a point of reference that lies, in principle, outside the world itself and which therefore can . . . serve as a regulator of all things inside the world as well as of . . . relationships."37 The result is a "reification of exist- ence" which extends even to the pilgrim's present life. "The regulator whose objetivity toward the world and himself is guaranteed by the loving anticipation of the desired good, is no longer concerned with either the world or himself." For Arendt, this is indeed a "strange dia- lectics." It makes plurality and judgement impossible on earth because of an absolute standard of truth in heaven.38 The remedy for this dilemma, Arendt continues, lies in Augustine's creativity as a theologian. She fastens on another form of love in Augus- tine's thought which is not based on appetitive craving, either for tran- scendence or for worldly happiness. This "entirely different" concept, which he terms caritas or neighborly love, derives from the union of the radical pilgrim with a Creator God who is "inside" not "outside." The mechanism of contingent grace is Augustine's way of internalizing the process of salvation and legitimating the possibility of freedom of choice. God's absolute power to save or damn is reflected in the free will of the individual who, while embedded in the facticity of a given community, has the God-like capacity to initiate "new beginnings." The contradiction in Augustine's works between caritas/natality and craving/desire for Neo-Platonic self-sufficiency is the central hypothesis of Arendt's dissertation. For her, it is precisely Augustine's willingness to make a new start amidst the "terminological context" of traditional Neo- Platonic Christianity which fascinates her.39 One could ask, she notes, 35.

Scholem proposed a kind of living in the world which required Arendt to declare an unjudgmental allegiance to the Jewish people as their "daughter." This was not a public body characterized by plurality and communication, but rather a community based on the "facts" of uniformity of inheritance and situation. Bearing in mind that she was working on revising the English translation of the dissertation in New York at the same time as the Eichmann controversy erupted, her responses to Scholem and the legions of others who challenged her van- tage point are more nuanced than they appear at first reading. Arguing in the Encounter letter that she never loved collectivities, only persons, Arendt might have been paraphrasing a very similar passage in the dis- sertation. In it she takes Augustine's Neo-Platonic biases to task for not providing some reasonable basis of judgment of particulars and individ- uals. When speaking of love as craving or appetite, Augustine is com- pelled to adopt an undifferentiated egalitarianism. To the question "Who is my neighbor,"Augustine always replies "Every man" [Omnis homo]. The answer is equivocal. It can liter- ally mean everyone is next to me; I have no right to choose; I have no right to judge; all men are brothers.40 Reading through the dissertation to her situation in New York in 1964, Arendt means that to be a Jew or a member of any other commu- nity by birth is not a sufficient factual datum to justify suspension of judgment about particular Jews or to hesitate in reporting Eichmann's banal normalcy. To say every Jew is my brother is to acknowledge con- sanguinity and common history. It is not to say that I must choose every Jew as my brother of my own free will and adjust my words and behav- ior accordingly. She had already directly addressed the issue of vantage point with respect to Jewishness in an exchange of letters with Jaspers in 1930. He questioned her about the Varnhagen study, noting its occa- sional dogmatic tone and a tendency to "objectify 'Jewish experience' existentially." Basically, he was accusing her of doing to Jews, and to Rahel particularly, what she had criticized Augustine for doing when he 40. Scott &amp; Stark 43</page><page sequence="16">34 Arendt Twenty Years Later lapsed into his Neo-Platonic mode of discourse. Arendt responded with deference but determination. She was not trying to reify the "fate of Jews" by rooting Rahel in a determinism of social condition and inherit- ance. Her work, instead, was a "preliminary" effort to indicate that a "certain possibility" which she "tentatively" called "fatefulness," emerges in the process of conscious distancing from Jewish identity in order to recapture it more fully. It is the historical givenness of the Jewish people which can be objectified so that it can be understood and reappropriated. This fatefulness . . . can occur only in a separation from Juda- ism .... An objectification is in fact there in a certain sense, but not an objectification of Jewish experience ... but of the histori- cal conditions of life .... 41 In the dissertation's long, exhaustive deconstruction of the two major conflicting arguments in Augustine's concept of love, Arendt uses Augustine as himself an exemplar of natality. He has set aside his Neo- Platonic heritage for a Pauline Christian concept of caritas which is rooted in the facticity of human social life but empowers the radical pil- grim as an agent in the world. Each life, and all lives together, can choose to imitate the life of Christ. The goal is not a formal likeness, but a living "imitatio" made possible by the historic intersection of divinity with human history. 42 The possibility of imitation, and thereby of freely choosing the grace of God did not exist until Christ revealed this grace to all peo- ple through his historic sojourn on earth. That these themes were translatable from a religious to a sociological setting seemed obvious to Arendt even as early as 1930, the year fol- lowing completion of her thesis. That year she published a review essay on Karl Mannheim's Ideology and Utopia, one of the most controver- sial books of 1929.43 In it she explores the emerging field of sociology and praises Mannheim for his attempt to apply "critical theory" to the 41.

She much prefers him to Lukacs, since Mannheim reaches for "reality" and not "socio-economic inter- est" as the "foundation of theory."44 The trouble is, however, that in exploring every analytic option Man- nheim does not make clear what his own might be - a rather ironic observation on Arendt's part, in view of the fact that she was often accused of the same sin of hiding in plain sight by her American crit- ics. Mannheim's social science thinks it "has something to say to phi- losophy" which is also searching for the relation between phenomenal reality and the everydayness of existence. The structure of Mannheim's argument allows what Arendt terms the "spiritual" to retain its signifi- cance to the extent that the social scientific observer is necessarily removed from the flux of experience. Yet Mannheim's typology of "utopian consciousness" which achieves "freedom from 'public exist- ence'," juxtaposed to "ideology" which is "existentially bound" to his- torical particulars, seems to be a Hobson's choice in which the possibility of critical, but engaged, thought is undermined. The spirit in question, as Arendt used the term in 1930, is the capacity for thought. Actually, she argues, Mannheim's neutral "platform" status is belied by his clear preference for ideology because "it is always inex- tricably bound to community." The trouble with his ideological "collec- tive subject," she argues, is that a "distrust of the spirit" goes along with it almost by definition. The collective focus of Mannheim's "ideology" forces individual consciousness into "a state of separation...no longer in tune with social existence." The givenness of the historical world stimu- lates "detachment" as a reaction. In between, there is a vacated nunc stans where the critical observer struggles in vain for a perspective from which to live in, but not of, the world. In the end, ideologies such as capitalism mean that a destructive public sphere structured by bourgeois materialistic culture has become so powerful that the solitude necessary for thought is possible only in alienation and "flight."45 Nowadays we are perhaps so much at the mercy of this public state of existence that even the possibility of our detachment from it can only be defined indirectly as 'being free from it"' Already in 1930 Arendt can be seen embarking on thought-trains which 44.

Juxtaposed to the dissertation's narrative of building community is the Mannheim review's negative portrait of mod- em society. Mannheim's world looks like the world of Heidegger's Das Man, and not Augustine's civitate. Its dominance forces the spirit to become isolated and irrelevant in the "ideological superstructure." She prefers other models, among them the Christian and the Weberian. Sum- moning up Francis of Assisi and Max Weber (surely an odd couple), Arendt says a way must be found to "live in the world" even with the knowledge that the ideal community "cannot be realized on earth." This sort of positioning is a "third possibility," which is neither utopian or ideological. "Such a detachment from the world does not lead to a desire to change it; yet it is also no flight from the historical world." Thus the radical pilgrim, whether a daughter of the Jewish people or of the Christian, moves in and out of the world constituted by communities and is never wholly determined by it. The fact that all such pilgrims in Christian terminology are equally damned by original sin and equally eager for redemption produces an "equality of condition" which is over- laid upon the social bonds of historical contiguity and inheritance. Both notions of equality are "the historically pre-existing reality.''6 And they demonstrate once again that for Augustine human life is always social. Or, as Arendt explains it, "this civitas terrena is not arbitrarily founded and not arbitrarily dissolved." It is a "social organism" made up of "peo- ple's living with and for each other" and not merely accidentally "side by side.'A7 For those radical pilgrims who have made the inner journey a return is demanded. Looking for God, the radical pilgrim finds his neigh- bor and accepts the ties of humanity that follow from that free choice. Though freedom of choice recalls the individual from the world and severs his essential ties with humankind, the equality of all people, once posited, cannot be canceled out. In this process, equality receives a new meaning, love of neighbor. Yet the new meaning denotes a change in the coexistence of people in their community, from being inevitable and matter-of-course to being freely chosen and replete with obligations.48 Arendt's concept of plurality means the mutually recognized integrity of persons and, with Augustine's help, can be sustained even in the 46. Scott &amp; Stark 99. 47. Scott &amp; Stark 100. 48. Scott &amp; Stark 102.</page><page sequence="19">Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott 37 midst of uniform historical conditions and mores. Augustine is able to shift the definition of equality from a historical condition to freely cho- sen love of neighbor because he has devised "an original definition of man as a social being.'49 Free will, following Augustine, allows indi- viduals in their plurality to choose the world. As Arendt paraphrases Augustine, "when I attain the explicitness of my own being by faith, the other person's being becomes explicit as well, in equality." The result is that "only then will the other become my brother." Individuality multi- plied and validated creates equality and love of neighbor. Caritas in fact "grows out of"' or is expressed by means of, this "explicit" tie of broth- erliness. Just as Arendt notes Augustine's repeated use of the terms "brother" for neighbor and "brotherly love," so too she insists on the "explicitness" of the individual's "own being" as the foundation for freely chosen community solidarity. 50 As a result, the answer to her initial question about the relevance of the neighbor within Augustine's Neo-Platonic mode of discourse is found on a different terrain of analysis in which salvation "is made to depend on the conduct of the world, or rather, its conquest."51 The saeculum [the given human world] is inherently ambiguous and full of possibilities. The cites of man and of God are intermingled, making the exercise of judg- ment within the saeculum both a necessary and sufficient condition for eventual reunion with the Creator. The neighbor is loved not because of common sin, the original source of equality, but because of grace- empowered natality. All people share a common historical kinship, Bib- lically expressed as generation from Adam. They also share, by Chris- tian reckoning, a common burden of sin. But because the historical Christ intersected the progression of history and moral geneology by his birth in the world, radical pilgrims can initiate new beginnings even within the givenness of cultural context. What changes is the "self-evi- dent living together in the earthly city." Arendt pairs "explictness" as a term describing the individual with "indirectness" as a descriptor for newly constituted social relations in Augustinian Christianity.52 Explict- ness and indirectness are the inherent components of the term Arendt would coin later in America, "plurality." Indirectness denotes the triangular relationship between the individual, 49. Scott &amp; Stark 104. 50. Scott &amp; Stark 108. 51. Scott &amp; Stark 107. 52.

Human awareness of historical descent as the basis of equality is superseded by acknowledgment of common sin, common grace and, ultimately, a common source in the divine Creator. "This indirectness," she writes, "puts an even more radical stop to the self-evident living together." Indirectness "breaks up social relations by turning them into provisional ones" and allows the individual as a dis- tinct being to be fully validated.53 The indirectness of the mutual relations of believers is just what allows each to grasp the other's whole being which lies in God's presence. In contrast, any worldly community envisions the being of the human race, but not that of the individual. The individual as such can only be grasped in the isolation in which the believer stands before God. Somewhat surprisingly, Arendt's gloss of Augustine does not confine the category of neighbor to believers. Pushing Augustine's logic beyond its contextual limits, she argues that the "relevance" of the neighbor is "not tied to Christianity" or, by implication, to any exclusive commu- nity.54 Faith is not the primary constituent element of caritas. Indeed it is "secondary" to the duty to "bring one's neighbor to the explicitness of his own being."55 Unlike his more apocalyptic contemporaries, Augustine refused to equate the City of God and the institutional church, and thus to delegitimate the political institutions of late Roman life. He "rarely" spoke in what she terms the "hyperbole" of dissolving individuals into anthropomorphic "members" of the Body of Christ. For his "great sanity," Arendt applauds him. Like Arendt, Augustine pre- ferred "the ambiguity of the human being in the world."56 The radical pilgrim lives in simultaneous isolation and engagement, drawn by the strange dialectics of caritas. II. Plurality: "Proud of Being a Negro or a Jew" Augustine exclaimed, Quaestio mihi factus sum! and asked after the source and meaning of his existence. His journey took him to an inner space and back again to his roles and responsibilities in the world, as he moved from believer to priest to Bishop of Hippo in rapid succession. 53.

Scott &amp; Stark 109.</page><page sequence="21">Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott 39 On the way he arrived at the "relevance of the neighbor" as a central component of his personal puzzle. Arendt extracted two main compo- nents of his journey for her own. First, the dialectic of explicitness and indirectness in caritas suggests a basis for defending individual integ- rity amidst multiplicity, which she would later term plurality. Second, although the givenness of social and political life cannot be denied or transcended by an authentic phenomenology, "natality" can refound communities, and judgment can pit individuals against the determining weight of history, blood ties and shared beliefs. Such lessons were implicit in her interchange with Scholem and were also near the surface in her 1961 Eichmann report and a number of unpublished letters to her friends and critics over the years. Her close friend Wystan Auden converted to Catholicism and became saint-like in his invocation of unquestioning charity towards his "neighbors." In a Feb. 14, 1960 letter to him, Arendt tried to distinguish between undif- ferentiated, unjudgmental love of the kind she had criticized in the Neo- Platonic version of Christianity, and would again in the Eichmann con- troversy, and a caritas based on choice. She rejects a charity which says "Who am I to judge?." About this she admits a "prejudice," but defends it on the grounds of that "the trouble with (this kind of) charity is that it levels out distinction," and like the law, "looks upon all with an equal eye." Instead, if humility requires passivity with respect to evil actions, as well as love of the perpetrators, she prefers "pride." That is, with pride "judgment remains unimpaired," even if ambiguity and doubt about one's true nature is also unresolved. Forgiveness is not based on true caritas if it entails silence about wrongdoing. A year before her Eichmann report, Arendt invokes war crimes in order to show that tradi- tional, non-Augustinian charity is just as incapable as the law of react- ing appropriately to crimes whose magnitude makes equal justice under law or equal charity before God meaningless.57 You are entirely right . .. that punishment is a necessary alterna- tive only to judicial pardon. I was thinking of the absurd position of the judges during the Nuremberg trials who were confronted with crimes of such a magnitude that they transcended all possi- ble punishment. But this is surely another matter. In 1959, one of the many critics of her position on federally mandated 57. Wystan H.

Matthew Lipman had sent a strongly worded letter to Dissent, which was not very dissimilar in tone and substance to the correspondence which had passed between Arendt, Ralph Ellison and the various editorial boards which had rejected her article on Little Rock. The controversy over Arendt's views on school desegregation had been her first widely publi- cized falling out with the prevailing consensus among the New Deal liberal, and largely Jewish, New York intellectuals. Commentary's rejection, and Dissent's careful distancing from the article, even while publishing it with a flourish, are illustrative of Arendt's ambivalent sta- tus among Americans opinion leaders. The former journal had demurred completely after a sort of literary hesitation waltz between Arendt and George Lichteim which ended in a bitter exchange of letters.61 After the publication, in responding to Lipman Arendt denied that she had been defending the "uniqueness of the person" as "liberal individu- alism" would do. She fully accepted the fact of social context. But she countered that "human dignity" is individually based and cannot be "injured by discrimination." That meant in her mind that the dignity of black children was more damaged by their forced insertion into a hos- tile white environment than it had been by the existing pattern of racially drawn school boundaries. Repeating her perspective in the dis- sertation, Arendt observed that the main victim of discrimination is "an individual who wishes to adjust to society as it is." For a Jew or Negro to wish to assimilate into the dominant culture suggests an unwilling- ness to accept plurality and the exclusivity of social groupings it neces- sarily entails. Civil rights in the political realm must be paid for in the coin of social discrimination. Lipman wanted to draw parallels between the status of Jews in Germany 58.

Arendt agreed, but added that the Prussian Jews "knew that this would be the case even before the whole business started." The evidence for this claim was that "the more assimilated among them who felt they could no longer live outside Gentile society tried desperately to prevent legal and political emancipation." Arendt replied that "one could even state it as a law: political equality always spelt social discrimination, whereas social recognition was always paid for by political inequality." Society is a given, incontrovertible fact, and it is useless to "deny its right to discriminat(e)." Since the problem of compulsory, unthinking uniformity was a far greater danger in Arendt's mind, she was willing to accept the "law" which decreed a trade off between political civil rights and prejudice. "Discrimination is only the other side of conformism," she wrote Lip- man. The only alternative is a "no-society" or "mass society," which as she had amply stated elsewhere is the precursor to totalitarianism. Transformed into the terms of her dissertation, the point at issue is both explicitness of identity and the indirectness of social bonding. Neither forced exclusion or inclusion are acceptable options for Arendt, since both occur at the expense of true caritas, or neighborly love. The sort of love which assimilation achieves for Jews and Blacks is one which, like the Augustine's love as appetitive craving or desire, results in dependence on what is outside or beyond reach. Ultimately, the objecti- fication of self and society lays the foundation for mass society with its pathology of simultaneous alienation from and dependence on external behavioral norms. In Arendt's mind, the thought train which moves from "loving" one's people as their "daughter" to the Eichmann desti- nation of acting "in such a way that the Fuhrer, if he knew your action, would approve it" makes very few stops.62 Whether speaking of Jewish politics, American politics, totalitarian- ism or, indeed, Augustinian caritas, Arendt always inserted the observa- tion that the undeniable givenness of history does not eliminate the obligation to make moral distinctions and act upon them. This held equally for European Jewish leaders, the parents of Negro children escorted by Federal troops in Little Rock, Hannah Arendt inserting her 62.

Arendt writes in the dissertation that "in estrangement from the world, divine grace gives a new meaning to human togetherness - defense against the world." Caritas abolishes the determining power of the city of Man,63 at the same time the believer is called upon to fight it. The past remains at work in the impossibility of complete isolation for the believer, who cannot act by himself [separatus], only with others or against them. Even though the believer is estranged from the world he continues to live in the world. In the "Reply to Critics" which Dissent allowed her, Arendt observed that far worse than political "persecution" was the stark reality of being "unwanted." What was at issue in the situation of the Negro children was personal dignity, "not anything like being 'proud of being a Negro or a Jew'." Arendt was referring instead, in Augustinian fashion, to "that untaught and natural feeling of identity with whatever we happen to be by accident of birth." Contra Scholem and Auden, this is a sense of being which does not preclude intellectual critical distance. The facts of one's context, the reality of Dasein, should not relate to one's public role as a matter of cause and effect, even if they do have a causal impact on private life and social placement. In her reply, Arendt reiter- ated the sort of pride she ascribed to Auden - a "pride which does not compare and knows neither inferiority or superiority," but which is "indispensable for personal integrity."64 It is also the sort of pride which is produced and nurtured by love as caritas, and which is the only possible foundation for judgment. 63.
