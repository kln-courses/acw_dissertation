<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oaks, ships, riddles and the Old English Rune Roem PAUL SORRELL The Holme Riddles are a collection of 144 English riddles preserved in London, British Library, Harley 1960. Although the manuscript dates from the mid-seventeenth century, some of these riddles are apparently rooted in ancient Germanic tradition. One of these, an ancient 'world-riddle' according to the editor, is a version of the 'oak-ship' riddle: Q. wn j lived j fed the liveing now j am dead j beare the live[in]g &amp; with swift speed j walk our the liveing A. a ship mad[e] of oake groweing feeds hogs with acorns now b[e]ars men &amp; swims our fishes.1 The Holme version is a late example of a riddle with a flourishing history in both Latin and the European vernaculars.2 In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries a number of German scholars collected versions of the 'oak-ship' riddle, often translating vernacular examples into Latin.3 Nicholas Reusner, for example, preserved five Latin versions of the quercus riddle in a collection published in 1602. Reusner's versions, like almost all the recorded examples, exploit the paradoxes inherent in the antithesis of 'the living and the dead': Donee viua fui, viuentia corpora paui: Immensaque cibos fertilitate tuli. Officiosa magis iam mortua, baiulo viuos, Et curuo viuos ambulo ventre super.4 Further versions were collected in the nineteenth century. The Royal Riddle Book (Glasgow, 1820) contains a versified English version,5 and in 1897 1 F. Tupper, 'The Holme Riddles (MS. Harl. I960)', PMLA 18 (1903), 211-72, at 222. Cited as no. 828h in A.

Nine manuscripts of the riddles survive, the earliest of which, Bern, Burgerbibliothek, 611 is dated to the early eighth century (the riddles are found on 73r-80v). Although there are no manuscripts of English provenance, the Bern Riddles were known to Aldhelm and (according to Frederick Tupper) 'belong to the same circle of thought as the Anglo-Latin problems'.8 They are mostly typical folk- riddles and, like the Old English riddles of the Exeter Book, are metaphoric, regularly describing one object (usually inanimate) in terms of another (animate), using the first person singular ('I am . . .'). The Bern version of the 'oak-ship' riddle (no. 11 in the collection and headed 'De ñaue') supports the familiar antithesis of 'the living and the dead' (line 1) with a secondary opposition between 'lying down' and 'standing upright' (line 2): Mortua maiorem uiuens quam porto laborem. Dum iaceo, muitos seruo; si stetero, paucos. Viscera si mihi foris detracta patescant, Vitam fero cunctis uictumque confero multis. Bestia defunctam auisque nulla me mordit, Et onusta currens uiam nec planta depingo.9 According to Archer Taylor, this 'old and famous riddle . . . was disseminated by the Apollonius romance'.10 Certainly a version of the 'oak-ship' riddle appears in the early-fourteenth-century Middle High German verse romance 6 R. Wossidlo, Mecklenburgische Volksüberlieferungen , 3 vols. (Wismar, 1897-1906) 1, 46 and 282. 7 Wossidlo, ibid. 1, 46: ťWhen I was small, the large ones nourished me, but when 1 was large, 1 fed the small ones; and when I was dead, I drew the living right over the living*. 8 Tupper, The Kiddles , p. xlvii.

Innumeris pariter comitum stipata cateruis Curro uias multas, uestigia nulla relinquens.12 The Old English version of the Historia Apollonii in the mid-eleventh-century Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 201, pp. 131-45, unfortunately has a large lacuna at this point (at least one quire is missing between pages 142 and 143, accounting for the loss of more than half the text) and we cannot tell whether the Old English translator, like Heinrich three centuries later, had substituted the 'oak-ship' riddle for the 'ship' enigma of Symphosius.13 However, that the 'oak-ship' riddle was known in Anglo-Saxon England is demonstrated by its appearance in the Old English R une Poem (hereinafter RP), lines 77-80. The original manuscript of the poem, London, British Library, Cotton Otho B. x, 165rv, was destroyed in the Cottonian Library fire of 1731. Fortunately Humphrey Wanley had made a transcript (now lost) for George Hickes, who printed it in pt I of his Thesaurus in 1705. 14 Although some additions may have been made to the original text,15 the form of the poem is clear. The letters of the Anglo-Saxon fuporc or runic alphabet are listed in order, and each is followed by a few lines of explication in Old English verse. The poem falls into twenty-nine short sections or stanzas of from two to five lines each. The version of the 'oak-ship' riddle that the poem incorporates is presented as a 'definition' of the ac- rune at lines 77-80: 11 Published and discussed by R.W. Pettengill, 'Zu den Rätseln im Apollonius des Heinrich von Neustadt', JEGP 12 (1913), 248-51. 12 Noted by Pettengill, ibid. p. 248. See also A. Riese, Historia Apollonii Regis Ty ri, 2nd ed. (Leipzig, 1893), p. 91. For the text given here see Variae Collectiones , ed. Glorie, p. 634: 'I am carried, long and swift, daughter of the beautiful forest. Packed together with countless bands of companions I pass over many ways, leaving no tracks behind'. 13 On the Old English text, see N.R. Ker, Catalogue of Manuscripts containing Anglo-Saxon (Oxford, 1957), p. 89. According to Ker, the Old English translates the type of Latin text found in a group of manuscripts of English provenance. These are discussed by J. Raith, Die alt- und mittelenglischen Apollonius-Bruchstücke, mit dem Text der Historia Apollonii nach der englischen Handschriftengruppe (Munich, 1956), pp. 87-91. Raith also published an edition of the Latin source nearest to the Old English version, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 318, fols. 477-509 (Raith, ibid . pp. 92-119). This manuscript includes the 'ship' riddle of Symphosius (Raith, ibid. p. 113). 14 G. Hickes, Linguarum Veterum Septentrionalium Thesaurus Grammatico-Criticus et Archaeôlogi- cus, 3 vols.

In its content and brevity it corresponds perhaps most closely to the second part (the 'Answer') of the Holme Riddle version given above. The statement about the oak in the Old English poem is elliptical and evasive; the first three verses (77-8a) are particularly oblique. The swine are not directly mentioned and there is no unequivocal description of the ship or even of the tree itself. The periphrastic phrase flasces fodor ( = 'acorns'?) is left unrelated to any possible referent. The last three verses (79b-80) are redundant from the point of view of the information needed to 'solve' the riddle, but curiously name the 'solution' (&lt; ac ), reinforcing this 'clue' with a possible pun on treow in line 80. The 'oak-ship' riddle in RP is based not on a paradox but rather on a fundamental incongruity. The poet gives us two characteristics only of the ac: it is both food for swine {flasces fodor ) and at the same time an ocean-going vessel. To arrive at the 'solution' the reader asks: what single thing comprises in itself these two apparently incompatible characteristics? (The suggestion of a sentient character in the riddle-subject in 79b-80 - especially in the phrase apele treowe - may be designed to throw the reader off the right track.) We should not be surprised to find a riddle embedded in a poem that is ostensibly of another kind. Riddle elements in The Dream of the Rood have long been remarked, most notably the likeness of the cross's opening speech to the Exeter Book riddles, in particular 'transformation' riddles such as 53 ('batter- ing ram') and 73 ('spear').17 And in the catalogue-poem The Fortunes of Men (21-4a), the portrait of a man falling to his death from a tree implies a 16 'The oak on the earth is food for flesh for the children of men. It often travels over the ganneťs bath; the ocean tests whether the oak has a noble faith'.

In two of these, riddles 24 ('magpie') and 75 ('dog'), the solution is spelled out by the runic letters. Riddles 19 and 64 each refer to a horse carrying a man and a hawk on a journey. The latest editor of the riddles has plausibly solved both enigmas as 'ship', where horse = ship and hawk = sail.19 In all four of these riddles, the runic letter- values only need to be deciphered; knowledge of the rune-names is not required. (In Cynewulfs four runic signatures, by contrast, both are significant.) Riddles are a species of verbal puzzle, a test of mental agility. Their purpose is to tease the mind, to mislead the reader (or auditor) in a playful spirit. This is certainly true of the Old English verse-riddles; they challenge the reader to offer a solution, to 'saga hwaet ic hatte' ('say what I am called'). Most of the Exeter Book riddles are constructed according to a consistent set of literary principles. The typical example takes the form of an oblique or ambiguous description in which a false solution is suggested in order to mislead the reader. The Old English riddle is a metaphorical genre, one thing being described in terms of another. This usually takes the form of a description of an inanimate object in terms appropriate to an animate being (often referred to in general terms such as wiht or deor). A typical example is the characterization of a rake as a toothed creature in riddle 34: Ic wiht geseah in wera burgum, seo ķaet feoh fedeõ. Hafaõ feia toļ&gt;a; nebb biķ hyre act nytte, niķerweard gongeõ, hi^eõ holdlice ond to ham tyhõ, wae1&gt;eõ geond weallas, wyrte seceõ; 18 'A particular man shall fall without wings from a tall tree in the wood; all the same he is in flight, he soars through the air until the height of the tree is no longer there/ Lacan is used of the flight of birds in The Phoenix 31 5b-l 6 (cf. The Metres of Boethius 24. 1 , 9a); Maxims II 38b- 9a (cf. Beowulf 2832); Alarias 143b-4 and Daniel 386b- 7a. Riddles (and quasi-riddles) occur in a less unexpected context in the esoteric verse-dialogue Solomon and Saturn II ; see esp. 210b-ll, 230-7, 282-91, 332-3 and 339b. 19 The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book, ed. C. Williamson (Chapel Hill, NC, 1 977), pp. 1 86- 7 and 325-6. Neither these two riddles nor two others solved as 'ship', riddles 32 ('wheel'?, 'wagon?) and 36, contain the 'oak-ship' motif. 107</page><page sequence="6">Paul Sorrell aa heo ļ&gt;a findeõ, ķa ķe faest ne biļp; laeteõ hio ķa wlitigan, wyrtum faeste, stille stondan on staķolwonge, beorhte blican, blowan ond growan.20 Detailed structural analysis of the riddle-form has been neglected by literary scholars, but some important work has been done by folklorists, in particular Archer Taylor. He distinguishes between the popular or descriptive riddle, which draws attention to the similarity between two unrelated objects, and the literary riddle, which is characterized by a profusion of unrelated details and thus lacks a consistent 'false solution'.21 A descriptive riddle is in two parts: a metaphorical description, in general terms (the 'false solution'), and a literal description in specific terms. This specific detail contradicts and thus elimi- nates the false, metaphorical solution and gives information necessary to identify the true subject of the riddle. (The specific, 'clinching' detail in riddle 34 is the information regarding the toothed creature's selection of plants: it takes the weak ones but leaves the strong ones standing.) This information is often expressed in terms of paradox.22 Taylor's analysis accurately describes most of the Old English verse- riddles. A few of these have characteristics of the 'literary' type (e.g. riddles 39, 40 and 84). Others lack a definitive 'literal' clue (or seem to do so to the modern reader) and thus remain unsolved (e.g. riddles 8, 20, 32, 49, 57, 70, 74 and 95). But most of the Old English riddles conform readily to Taylor's 'popular' or 'descriptive' type. (The structure of this type is perhaps most clearly seen in the 'obscene' riddles 25, 37, 44, 45, 54, 61 , 62 and 87, where there is an 'innocent' as well as an indecent solution.) In these the clinching clue is often expressed in terms of paradox or incongruity (e.g. riddles 6, 7, 33.9-1 la, 46, 58.10-12a, 60.9b ( muòleas sprecati) and 65.1-2a). Allied to these are the devices of contrast and antithesis (e.g. riddles 62.1b-2a, 6b-8a; 65.5 and 85šl, 5, 6-7). The contrast of 'the living and the dead' (which we found in the classical form of 20 *1 saw a creature in the towns of men, one that feeds cattle. It has many teeth. Its beak is useful to it, it travels pointing downwards, it plunders according to instructions and comes home again, roams about right up to the walls, seeking plants. It always finds those that are not firm; it leaves the healthy ones, fast by their roots, standing fixed in their plot, shining brightly, blooming and growing.' 21 Taylor, The Literary Kiddle , pp. 1-3. 22 A.

Like the 'literary' and some other kinds of riddle, 'transformation' riddles are solved principally by the gradual accumulation of detail. Examples from the Exeter Book already mentioned are riddles 53 ('battering-ram') and 73 ('spear'), both of which are described as originating as trees growing in the forest.26 Many of the Old English riddles are purely descriptive, although a number contain significant narrative elements. Descriptive elements are selected as much to disguise as to define the subject of the riddles; the strategy adopted by the riddle-poets is one of simultaneous disclosure and concealment. Many of the conventional stylistic features of Old English poetry are exploited in the service of this strategy. In particular, the riddles exploit the wide range of denotations of Old English words in a number of ways. The use of periphrasis, kennings and metaphorical expressions gives an oblique character to the diction of the riddles. Standard compositional features of Old English verse such as phrasal variation, synonyms and appositives are used to create an enigmatic effect. Reference to an object in general terms conceals its identity. Thus, riddle 15 ('badger') contains many general expressions for the badger's set and for the intruding creature, and in riddle 21 ('plough') the ploughman (or ox) is described as har ho It es feond (3). In riddle 48 a chalice is a bring (1 and 8), and in riddle 59 the same subject is a bring (1, 6 and 17), a wripa (5) and a heag (11); while in riddle 4 ('bell'?) the subject is referred to as a bring (2), a halswripa (4) and a bag (8). In riddle 3 sailors are brimgiesta (25) and in riddle 47 a bookmoth is a stalgiest (5), as well as a moòòe (1), a wyrm (3) and a peof in pystro (4). Sometimes such periphrases are so conventional as to be scarcely misleading, as with the various terms for 'sea' in riddle 2 or those for 'sword' in riddle 5 (e.g. l-3a, 7-8 and 13). On the other hand, some periphrases are particularly evasive, such as those in riddle 64.3a {habbendes hyhf) and 4a {sny Ice prypa dal). Kennings occur in riddles 26.7 fugles nyn ( = 'quill-pen') and 93.29, wulfes gehlepan ( = 'raven'). There are also unusual compounds, such as wagfatu (riddle 3.37). Metaphorical expressions and anthropomorphisms abound: in 23 Tupper, The Kiddles y pp. xxiii-xxiv. 24 See Williamson, The Old English Kiddles , p. 219. 25 The same motif is found in riddle 83 of Aldhelm (Tuvencus') and riddle 37 of Eusebius (ťDe Vitulo'); see Williamson, ibid. p. 255. 26 The Old English riddles of this type in the Exeter Book are riddles 26, 28, 53, 73, 83, 88 and 93; cf. 9, 12, 14, 27, 74 and 77. For a brief discussion of the Old English 'transformation' riddles, see Tupper, The Kiddles , p. 186. 109</page><page sequence="8">Paul Sorrell riddle 13 ("ten chickens') an egg-shell is characterized as fell (3), reaf (7) and fratwe (10), and feathers are hragl (9), just as in riddle 7 the swan's feathers are described as hragl (1) and fratwe (6). In riddle 9 the young cuckoo is covered with garments {wedum peccati , 4b; cf. under sceate , 7), and riddle 11 ('wine') begins: Hraegl is min hasofag, hyrste beorhte, reade ond scire on reafe minum.27 In riddle 23 the solution ('bow') is presented in terms of a venom-spitting dragon; the effect depends on a careful choice of equivocal vocabulary, e.g. onbuge (3) and the past participle unbmden (15) which is skilfully used in the final, paradoxical sentence (15-16) to clinch the true solution while still retaining the force of the metaphor. Verbal polysemy is exploited by the Old English riddlers, and often gives rise to word-play of various kinds. Thus more than one meaning is suggested in sip (85.3), wise (80.10), and fah (20.16), and at riddle 55.12 the apparent ambiguity of abad may be intended. There is a pun in riddle 73.22a ( crafte on hafte) , and in riddle 32.6 ex le may be a pun on eax ('axle').28 Finally, a number of stock formulae and imprecise words and expressions are used in the riddles to help cloak the true solution. The phrase hyrstum fratwed (14.11; cf. 31.2, 20; 32.2) might be applied to any suitable object; other vague terms, usually found at the beginning of a riddle, include wundor (47.2); wunderlic (in the expression 'ic eom wunderlicu wiht', 20. 1 , 24. 1 , 25. 1 ); wratlic (31 . 1 8, 33. 1 , 42. 1 , 44. 1 , 47.2; cf. 68.2) and sellic (31.3 and 32.3, 5). Another notable feature of the Old English riddles, of their content rather than of their language, is the anthropocentric bias found in many of them. The riddles often refer to an object's 'utility', its usefulness (or otherwise) to mankind, and in riddles 6 ('sun'), 27 ('mead') and 50 ('fire') this is made the basis of a paradox: the objects described are both inimical to man and benevolent, at the same time.29 So much for our survey of some of the characteristics of the Old English verse riddles. A closer examination of RP reveals many points of similarity with the riddles.30 Ostensibly an exercise in objective definition, RP in fact 27 'My clothing is darkly shimmering, bright with adornment, red and shining with respect to my garment.' 28 For puns and wordplay in riddle 47, see F.C. Robinson, 'Artful Ambiguities in the Old English "Book-Moth" Riddle', Anglo-Saxon Poetry : Essays in Appreciation , ed. L. Nicholson and D.W. Frese (Notre Dame, IN, 1975), pp. 355-62. 29 On this aspect of the riddles see Tupper, The Kiddles , p. lxxxviii. 30 Halsall ( The Old English Rune Poem , pp. 40-2) notes some general similarities, as does Tupper, The Kiddles , p. xiv. Tupper also (ibid. p. 191) compares the 'oak-ship' riddle of RP with one of the German examples (no. 78) collected by Wossidlo (see above, p. 104, n. 6). 110</page><page sequence="9">Oaks, ships, riddles and the Old English (Kune Poem ' participates in the kind of selection and combination of descriptive elements that is characteristic of the Old English riddles. Peter Clemoes has drawn attention to the way in which, in Anglo-Saxon thought, natural objects reveal themselves by characteristic properties, manifested in action. Applying this concept to Aldhelm's 'Creation' riddle, Clemoes notes that 'the very fascina- tion of the riddle genre itself is to recognize what a creature is from what it manifests'.31 Emphasis on the characteristic properties and actions of objects introduces a form that is sometimes associated with the riddle, the gnomic statement, particularly the variety of gnome that makes observations about features of the natural world.32 Both riddles and gnomes of this type share a preoccu- pation with characteristic behaviour - an identity of actor and action that is essential to the concept of the thing in question, and may even define it. Clemoes gives as an example the way in which an animal can be classified in Anglo-Saxon thought according to its environment.33 Thus the gnomic statement 'fisc sceal on waetere' ( Maxims II 27b) finds its counterpart in riddle 85, 'fish and river'. A fish living out of water would be seen as a violation of the natural order, an abrogation of the constant, predictable relationships that provide a relatively stable context for human activity in the world.34 Yet this is precisely the startling paradox exploited by the poet of RP (87-9): f (iar, ior) by ķ eafix, and õeah a bruceķ fodres on foldan, hafaķ faegerne eard, waetre beworpen, aer he wynnum leofaķ.35 31 P.

The Ancient Literatures of Europe (Cambridge, 1932), pp. 377-8. 33 Clemoes, Action in Beowulf , p. 156. 34 For this theme in RP, see especially 32-4 and 48-50. For a discussion of the theme in Beowulf and other poems, see S.B. Greenfield, The Authenticating Voice in Beowulf , ASE 5 (1976), 51-62, at 55-6; and P. Clemoes, 'De quelques articulations entre présent et passé dans la technique narrative vieil-anglaise', Actes du colloque de l' Association des médiévistes anglicistes de Renseignement supérieur sur les techniques narratives au moyen âge , ed. A. Crépin (Amiens, 1 974), pp. 5-21, at 15-19. Cf. also the section on the creation of the world in Genesis A (92-186), which contains several references to the continuity and stability of natural processes (see esp. 140b- 3a, 152b-3 and 157b-60a). 35 Tar , ior is a riverfish, and yet it always takes its food on land; it has a pleasant home surrounded by water, where it lives happily.' lar , ior is usually interpreted as 'eel' or 'newt' (see Halsall, The Old English Rune Poem , p. 157). However, riddle 53 of Eusebius ('De y&lt;ppo&gt;potamo pisce') uses the same antithesis in its closing lines (5-6): 'Rorifluo cunctos degens in gurgite phoebos, / Rura per umbríferas depascor florida noctes' ('All the sunny days I spend in rushing waters, / in the dusky nights I graze the verdant countryside' - editor's trans.; Variae Collectiones, ed. Glorie, p. 263). The iar- rune is a late, non-epigraphic rune, and in a learned context an exotic referent such as 'hippopotamus' would not be out of place. Ill</page><page sequence="10">Paul Sorrell Formally, riddles and gnomes are akin in that the two forms are mutually convertible under certain circumstances. This is particularly true of statements that make use of the comparative or the superlative. Thus the gnomic assertion in RP 25a, 'haegl by ķ hwitust corna' ('hail is the whitest of grains') could readily become the riddle-question: 'what is the whitest of grains?' To a reader ignorant of runes, it is already a riddle.36 Statements that can be construed as gnomic certainly appear in RP, particularly when the gnomic verb-form bjp is combined with a statement of universais (e.g., 1, 19, 22, 25a, 59, 71 and 90). From one perspective, most of the runic sections could be classified as descriptive nature-gnomes of the kind found in Maxims /J, emphasising what is characteristic, recurrent, inevitable, and so on.37 But whereas the gnomes of Maxims II are 'objective', describing 'things as they are', the definitions of RP have the kind of 'subjective' bias that we have met in the Exeter Book riddles: they offer practical wisdom, assessing objects and concepts 'anthropocentrically, according to how they affect people'.38 Thus RP 63-6 offers not so much a gnomic statement or a definition as attributes and characteristics related to human comfort: r (lagu) byķ&gt; leodum langsum gemuht, gif hi sculun neķan on nacan tealtum, and hi saeyjsa swyļ&gt;e bregaķ, and se brimhengest bridles ne gymeõ.39 Things are described, not in accordance with some abstract notion of 'essential character', but in terms of their practical effects. This bias towards 'utility', then, is one of the common features displayed by both RP and the Exeter Book riddles. Before proceeding to investigate further formal similarities, it is worth reflecting on the manuscript evidence offered by Hickes's edition of RP as a guide to the poet's (or scribe's) intention in the presentation of his material. Hickes noted that the roman letter- values and the names of the runes in each section had been added, but he did not say 36 Compare the series of four gnomes in Solomon and Saturn II 312-13, beginning 'Nieht biö wedera õiestrost' (312a). For folk 'riddles' of the superlative and the comparative, see S. Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Łiterature 3 (Copenhagen, 1956), 436-40. Latin question- and-answer dialogues such as Alcuin's Disputatio regalis et nobilissimi iuvenis Pippini cum Albino scholastico (ed. L. W. Daly and W. Suchier, Altercatio Hadriani Augusti et Epicteti Philosophic Illinois Stud, in Lang, and Lit. 24.1 (Urbana, IL, 1939), 137-43) offer short definitions of objects and concepts that take the form of metaphorical periphrasis, paradoxical statements ('riddles-in-reverse'), similes and literal descriptions which, like some of the Old English verse-riddles, have a subjective, anthropocentric bias. 37 Chadwick and Chadwick, The Growth of Literature I, 415, characterize RP in this way. 38 T. A. Shippey, Poems of Wisdom and Learning in Old English (Cambridge and Totowa, NJ, 1976), p. 20. 39 'The sea seems endless to men, if they should venture out in a tossing boat, and the sea- waves terrify them, and the sea-horse does not respond to its bridle.' 112</page><page sequence="11">Oaks, ships, riddles and the Old English 'Rune Poem ' when or by whom. The poem's latest editor, Maureen Halsall, considers that the roman letters, along with various additional runes and variant rune forms and rune names were supplied by Wanley or Hickes as a linguistic apparatus. She further surmises that the rune names that prefix each stanza were supplied by some earlier reader, perhaps in Anglo-Saxon times.40 The original poem then may well have taken the form of the bare runic letters attached to their respective verse-stanzas, such as: N byķ&gt; hwitust coma . „ (25a). Thus to the reader unversed in runes, the subjects of many of the stanzas would be by no means immediately apparent, and all the statements in the poem would take on an enigmatic character. We have seen that the concept of 'utility' is common to both the verse- riddles and to RP. The other characteristics of the riddle form discussed above - structural, stylistic, lexical - can also be applied to RP. The metaphorical structure of the 'descriptive' riddle is present in several sections of the poem. Thus 'eolhxsecg' is presented as a weapon (or perhaps a warrior) capable of inflicting wounds (41-4); 'daeg' is anthropomorphized as drihtnessond ('the Lord's messenger', 74); and 'aesc' suggests a 'false solution' of 'powerful warrior' (81-3): P (aesc) biķ&gt; oferheah, eldum dyre, stiķ on staķule, stede rihte hylt, õeah him feohtan on firas monige.41 Contrast and antithesis are used as structuring devices in several sections of the poem, whether the referent is a physical object ('iar, ior', 87-9); a human being ('man', 59-62); or a concept ('rad', 12-15;42 'feoh', 1-3; ťgyfu', 19-21 and 'nyd', 27-8). In each case, the thing in question is seen under two 40 Halsall, The Old English Rune Poem , pp. 24-6; cf. Shippey, Poems , p. 81 . 41 "The ash is very tall, valuable to men; strong in its position, it keeps its proper place, even though many men attack it.' 42 The 'raď section describes an activity that is comfortable ( sefte ) in the hall, but very energetic ( swiphwat ) for someone on horseback. A similar concept of 'riding' underlies thç fourth of the Bern riddles, 'De scamno', in which a seat is described in terms of a horse: Mollibus horresco semper consistere iocis, Vngula nam mihi firma, si caute ponatur. Nullum, iter agens, sessorem dorso requiro, Plures fero libens, meo dum stabulo uersor. Nolo frena mihi mansueto iuueni pendas, Calcibus et senem nolo me uerberes ullis. ( Variae Collectiones , ed. Glorie, p. 550: 'I am always terrified of standing in soft places, but my hoof is stable if placed on a rock (Pcarefully). Making a journey, I need no sitter on my back. Willing, I carry many while I live in my stable. I do not want you to rein me in while I am a tame youth, nor do I want you to beat me with your heels when I am old'.) 113</page><page sequence="12">Paul Sorrell contrasting aspects, the two members of the antithesis or paradox being linked by either the conjunction Öeah (2, 27, 60 and 87) or by and used in the adversative sense (14 and 20). Deah is frequently used for the same purpose in the Exeter Book riddles (e.g. 13.6; 18.2; 40.47, 65; 48.2; 93.19 and 95.10). In RP 51-4, 'beorc', the element of incongruity is expressed in the opening verses: &amp; (beorc) byķ bieda leas, bereļ&gt; efne swa õeah tanas butan tudder . . .43 The rest of the verse-paragraph is a generalized description of a tree, so that the materials for a definitive 'solution' are to be sought here in lines 51-2a. Since 'beorc' cannot here mean 'birch', this is a real riddle. The conjunction used here, efne swa òeahy is also paralleled from the riddles (see 39.27 and 65.1). Two sections, 'ger', 32-4 and ťdaeg', 74-6, utilize the antithesis of 'wealthy and poor' as a means of suggesting the universal application of their referents in a slightly enigmatic manner (cf. riddle 84.28). Other sections of RP eschew devices such as these and present their subject either under a single aspect (e.g. 'õorn' and 'eķel') or by the accumulation of apparently disparate details (e.g. 'eoh', 'wenne', 'is' and 'ur'). We have seen that 'transformation' riddles operate in this way, describing a change of state in the riddle-subject.44 The 'ac' and 'haegl' sections of RP bear close resemblance to this kind of riddle. Hail, the whitest of grains, is tossed about in showers by the wind, then afterwards turns to water ('weorķeļ? hit to waeter syõõan', 26b). Tupper considered that the 'aesc' section (81-3) had affinities with 'transformation' riddles, and compares these lines in RP with riddle 73 ('spear').45 The diction of RP likewise shows many affinities with the riddles. As in the riddles, features such as periphrasis, kennings and metaphorical expressions have the effect of concealing the subject as much as revealing it. The dag- rune, for example, is characterized as both drihtnes sond (74, 'the Lord's messenger', a superficially misleading anthropomorphism) and as mare metodes leoht (75, 'the Ruler's glorious light'). Often the periphrases are very general in their application, as are the various phrases standing in apposition to 'os', 'mouth', at 11-12. And the 'aurochs'-stanza ('ur') describes its subject as felafrecne deor (5, 'a very fierce animal') and as mare morstapa (6, 'famous moor-stepper'), a 43 'The poplar has no fruit, but just the same it puts out suckers without fertile seeď (trans. Shippey, Poems, p. 83; see also his n. 11). 44 See above, p. 109. 45 Tupper, The Kiddles , p. 212. Dobbie (ASPR 6, 159) also finds a possible 'double reference, to the ash as tree (81 -2a) and as spear (82b-3). 114</page><page sequence="13">Oaks y ships y riddles and the Old English ' Rune Poem ' phrase that could readily be applied to a variety of animals associated with this habitat.46 Generalized expressions such as hrysted fagere (53, "finely adorned') recall phrases such as hyrstum fratwed ("adorned with trappings', riddle 14.11) in the riddles. Other periphrases are so general and elliptical that their precise referent is not immediately apparent; the phrase hyrde fyres (35, "guardian of the fire') in the paragraph on the yew ("eoh', 35-7) is a good example. In one case ("yr', 84-6) the rune-name remains unidentified because the appositive phrases lack the precision necessary to isolate the subject from the class of objects to which it belongs: fri (yr) byļ&gt; aeķelinga and eorla gehwaes wyn and wyrjpmynd, byļ&gt; on wiege faeger, faestlic on faerelde, fyrdgeatewa sum.47 The "solution' "bow' is secured if one understands farelde as "flight',48 but this word usually has the more general sense of "journey, passage', as at line 49. Particularly remarkable for its periphrases is the "is' stanza (29-31): I (is) by oferceald, ungemetum slidor, glisnaķ glaeshluttur, gimmum gelicust, flor forste geworuht, faeger ansyne.49 Here ice is seen in some of its characteristic manifestations; its effects on people include both the practical (29) and the aesthetic (31b). The metaphorical element is pronounced in this portrait: ice is compared first to glass, then to jewels, and finally to the floor of a building. Each verse is a miniature description in itself - ice is all of these things. In particular, the perphrasis at 31a y flor forste geworuht ("a floor made by the frost') can be seen as a riddle-in- miniature, or perhaps as an expanded kenning. This phrase illustrates the affinities of riddles and kennings and the function of a kenning as a "compressed' riddle.50 The function of kennings in RP is similar to their use in the riddles: their metaphorical character (especially the expression of inanimate things in animate terms) represents a perfunctory attempt to cloak the true "solution'. 46 See Clemoes, 'Action in Beowulf, p. 1 56 for a discussion of the related haÔstapa . Morstapa is a compound unique to RP. 47 'A bow(?) is a joy and mark of distinction for every prince and noble; it looks fine on a horse, secure in its journeying, a particular piece of battle-gear.' 48 As does Shippey, Poems, p. 85; see also his n. 13. 49 'Ice is very cold, extremely slippery; it shines clear as glass, very like jewels, a floor made by the frost, beautiful to look at.' 50 See A. H. Stewart, 'Kenning and Riddle in Old English', Papers on Lang, and Lit. 1 5.2 (1979), 115-36. 115</page><page sequence="14">Paul Sorrell Thus brimhengest ('sea-horse' = 'ship') is used in both the 'sigel' and ťlagu' sections (47, 66). In the former passage it is reinforced by the phrase fisces hep ('fishes' bath' = 'sea') at 46, and in the 'lagu' section the use of the kenning is extended into the metaphor of the sea-horse refusing to respond to its bridle (66). Most of the structural and linguistic features identified as common to both the Exeter Book riddles and RP are present in the 'ac' section of R P (77-80). There is a suggestion of anthropomorphism, especially in 79b-80. The utilitarian element is also present, notably in the phrase elda bearnum ('for the children of men', 77b).51 The oak's change of state from a fodder-bearing tree to an ocean-going vessel suggests its affinities with 'transformation' riddles, a form in which (as we have seen) the subject 'tree' is particularly appropriate. A kenning is found at 79 {gañotes bap , 'gannet's bath' = 'sea'), and there may be a pun on treowe at 80. As mentioned above, the periphrasis flasces fodor (77) is particularly elliptical and evasive, just the kind of imprecise and contextually undefined phrase used so artfully by the Anglo-Saxon riddlers. Finally, there is the question of the poet's announcing of the 'solution' in the body of the text (&lt; ac , 80; cf. 35 {tre oni), 56 {hors) and 65 {saypa)). While this may seem an otiose element in a riddle, there are parallels in both the Latin collections and the Exeter Book riddles (e.g. 23.1 and 47.1). 52 There seems little doubt that, in his explication of the runic letter-names, the poet of RP was drawing on conventions of structure and language associated with the riddle-form. Beyond this general influence, it is equally clear that the poet's familiarity with the ancient Germanic 'oak-ship' riddle helped shape the 'ac' section of the poem, determining, at least in part, the selection and combination of its elements.53 51 Similar phrases are found throughout the poem, usually in the second verse of each stanza, e.g. lb, 7b, 13b, 27b, 55b, 71b, 74b, 81b and 90b. 52 See also N. Howe, 'Aldhelm's Enigmata and Isidorian Etymology', ASE 14 (1985), 37-59, at 37 and 45. 53 An early version of this paper was presented to the eighth Annual Conference of the Australian and New Zealand Association for Medieval and Renaissance Studies held in Christchurch, NZ, on 21-6 August 1979. 116</page></plain_text>
