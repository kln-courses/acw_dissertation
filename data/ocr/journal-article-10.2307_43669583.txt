<plain_text><page sequence="1">RLJ, XXXIV, No. 117 (1980) Serge Lec от te* SCATOLOGICAL DETAILS IN VOJNOVIČ'S ŽlZN' I NEOBYCAJNYE PRIKLJUCENIJA SOLDATA IVANA CONKINA Scatological details have served as literary devices in serious works of art since Aristophanes. Among the great scatologists we can name Rabelais, Chaucer, Villon, Montaigne, Boccacio and Jonathan Swift; numerous minor writers also dabbled in scatology as a literary device. The usage of scatological details has been varied. It has served the purpose of criticism and ridicule. In works by the major writers mentioned above, such details are primarily used as devices of satire rather than shock. In her work, Swift and Scatological Satire, Jae Num Lee categorizes these details into socio-political, religio-moral, intellectual and personal satire, all of which lower the reputation of either individuals or institutions to the level of dirt. ^ The usage of scatological details, however, has not always been of a literary nature. Rabelais, the most exuberant of the great scatologists, for instance, used such details to evoke laughter in his readers. ^ One might term scatological and pornographic details as crude and shocking if their use is out of place and serves no purpose. In Vojnovic's Zizn' i neobycajnye prikljucenija soldata Ivana Čonkina , the numerous scatological details don't obtrude. Instead, they serve a distinct literary purpose by reinforcing certain themes the author has chosen to smear or attack; they are of a satirical nature. At the beginning of the novel we are transported to a land of mud and muck, to the former village of Grjaznoe, renamed Krasnoe, the almost-homonym of which is used to point out the absurdity of man's behavior. Vojnovic illustrates how the superficial use of words to paint over cities and villages or to redefine ideas and myths so as to make the Soviet man into what he has become--is, indeed, a farce. Life goes on with or without labels. Definitions, legal or lexical, cannot change man. By the end of the novel, Soviet Russia has indeed become a land of early spring mud into which Soviet man sinks deeper and deeper to the point where he swallows the muck. After he has swallowed so much of it, he cannot help but smell like it or speak in such a manner that logic escapes him. The only "logic" he understands is the "logic" he has been fed. Scatological details constantly point out the absurdity of man's behavior and underline his lack of "spiritual" growth. Such words are used to sling muck at other words and ideas. The stench of the words, therefore, removes the aura or myth associated with ideas that have become perverted at the hands of a few bureaucrats, who in turn pervert the average man. The removal of myths or остра- нение if one wants to call it that, is what Vojnovic is dealing with. Words are used *Serge Lecomte is an Assistant Professor of Russian. Department of Linguistics and Foreign Languages, University of Alaska. Fairbanks.

Let us proceed and see how this process works successfully. GladiŠev, perhaps a parody of MiČurin himself, isa self-styled scientist whose world is limited to his hybrid-to-be (a cross between a tomato and a potato) named ПУКС. Gladiifev is extremely fond of mythology, as a matter of fact, his world is defined according to books of a scientific nature, but the only book mentioned by name is Myths of Ancient Greece. His wife, a filthy, unkempt woman who smells of dung because of Gladiïev's experiments, is ironically named Aphrodite after the goddess of beauty, while their son is named Hercules. Gladiïev's erudition is shown by his knowledge of the English language. His outhouse is not just a mere out- house, but a "WATER-CLOSET." Words and fanciful names again cannot either change the surface of people's lives nor modify the reality of objects. Gladisev may have read Myths of Ancient Greece , but man is still identified by his being, nature and soul, not labels or new vocabulary. The myth is destroyed when we recognize that Aphrodite is not beautiful, but ugly, smelly Fros'ka whom no amount of renaming will change. The outhouse is an outhouse, and neither foreign labels nor erudition will change the smell in it. Incidentally, it is from an outhouse that Čonkin hears about the war, and the war begins while he is defecating. It would seem that Vojnovič is making the act of defecation into a sort of war protest. Gladiïev is immersed in a world that revolves around feces of all kinds which he will use for the betterment of mankind-symbolized by the hybrid -to-be, ПУКС (Путь к социализму) . In using such an anagram that is onomatopoetic for the sound of flatus, the author again destroys a myth-this time it is not a Greek myth, but a recent historical phenomenon. ПУКС is a symbol for the betterment of life for the Soviet man. It is the ideal for the future-the Utopian dream that is un- reachable because man cannot change his being and no amount of education will make all men into blissful idiots living in some dream world. ПУКС is the symbol for the system itself, and Gladišev is the protector of this hybrid-to-be. He is a sort of perverted Greek-communist-god who looks after the "Garden of Eden," the future of the nation. Gladisev's own house is a sort of outhouse that smells so bad Čonkin almost dies as he enters. Gladisev demands sacrifices for the future, but at the expense of his Aphrodite, Hercules and those who have to enter his "house." It is from this outhouse that his ideas come-ideas that will feed the future genera- tions. The entire world Gladisev lives by is of a purely scatological nature. In a dialogue between Conkin and Gladisev, the latter's views are disclosed: Вот, Ваня, мы привыкли относиться к дерьму с этакой брезгливостью, как будто это что-то плохое. А ведь разобраться, так это, может быть, самое ценное не земле вещество, потому что вся наша жизнь проис- ходит из дерьма и в дерьмо же уходит. - Это в каком смысле ? - вежливо спросил Чонкин, поглядывая голодными глазами на остывающую яичницу, но не решаясь присту- пить к ней раньше хозяина. 146</page><page sequence="3">- А в каком хошь, - развивал свою мысль Гладышев, не замечая нетерпения гостя. - Посуди сам. Для хорошего урожая надо удобрить землю дерьмом. Из дерьма произрастают травы, злаки и овощи, ко- торые едим мы и животные. Животные дают нам молоко, мясо, шерсть и все прочее. Мы все это потребляем и переводим опять на дерьмо. Вот и происходит, как бы это сказать, круговорот дерьма в природе. И скажем, зачем же нам потреблять это дерьмо в виде мяса, молока или хотя бы вот хлеба, то есть в переработанном виде ? Встает закон- ный вопрос: не лучше ли, отбросив преубеждение и ложную брезгли- вость, потреблять его в чистом виде как замечательный витамин ?3 v v After his scatological dissertation, Gladisev proceeds to feed Conkin vodka made from excrement to prove that there is nothing wrong with it. Gladi&amp;v has been immersed in his own dung for so long that he is like some of Gogol"s characters who cannot smell their own stench. The whole of Chapter 15 appears ridiculously funny, but the scatological details have a distinct purpose-to posit certain questions about man's state of being. GladiSev, who is a perverted god, immersed in dung and excrement, is none other than the system itself, and it is he who feeds Conkin the vodka that almost kills him. "Shit" attains a greater symbolic meaning; it represents ideas, myths, slogans and words that make people into the kind of human animals they have become. I do not think, however, that Vojnovič is limiting his meaning to the microcosm of Krasnoe or the Soviet Union; the meaning is a universal one. What has become of man ? What have systems done to him as a being ? Can we blame systems for man's lack of spirituality ? Gogol' did not blame social systems for man's lack of spirituality, but man himself. Perhaps this is a major difference that one must recognize when comparing Vojnovič to Gogol'. Vojnovič questions the identity of Soviet man or man in general. What is he ? Is man just "shit" the way Gladisev expresses it ? Is man a direct descendant of the apes, according to Darwin ? Is man a direct descendant from the horse as Con- kin posits ? Is he just a pig ? Is a horse a human being without fingers ? Is man here on earth simply to perform basic biological functions the way people in Grjaznoe, including Conkin, perform them ? All of these twisted questions are asked. At the outset of the novel the following statement made about man's new social state appears: В "Блокноте" говорилось, что всяческие суеверия достались нам в 4 наследство от темного прошлого и их надо решительно искоренять. The irony of this statement is obvious; the new man has simply become rooted in new superstitions and myths. It is, of course, an inescapable process that man should constantly redefine his state, but in this case, man's state is defined for him. The people of Grjaznoe are made into ignorant beings, even pigs and workhorses. They wallow in muck because they are forced to do so; in several scenes, in fact, the people are standing in mud. Njurka, a major character, is introduced to the reader as an "animal" on all fours uprooting potatoes. Ironically, Bor'ka, her pet 147</page><page sequence="4">pig, is rooting next to her. Čonkin is introduced to us as he is doing push-ups as punishment. As the novel progresses, Čonkin evolves into his own being as he moves away from the politruk and those who either spit in his ear or spread rumors about Bor'ka and Njurka sleeping together. Several analogies between man and beast are made, but čonkin begins to reason on his own. One should not reason in a system that has its own "objective" reasoning, for if one does, one is then either insane or very ignorant. In a number of dialogues between Čonkin and several characters, the absurdity which emerges out of such thinking reaches ridiculous heights. If a system thinks that man does not know what is good for him, the system provides the thinking through organizations and regulations for such organizations. Humans then need not think; they must, however, conform. In a strange^dream which Čonkin has, Vojnovič explores the rule of conformity. In this dream Conkin sees people resembling pigs eating and gorging themselves on food. He joins the party. Conkin eats with them, but soon is admonished by those present: -- Хрюкни, хрюкни, -- зашептала молоденькая свинка, подталкивая Чонкина локтем. -- Ваня, -- сказала ласково Нюра. -- Хрюкни, но что тебе стоит. Я раньше тоже не умела, а теперь научилась и ничего. Скажи "хрю-хрю" и все. -- На что вам всем это нужно, -- застонал Чонкин, -- ну на это ? Я же вам ничего не говорю, хрюкайте, если нравится, только я то при чем ? Я же все- таки не свинья, а человек. -- Давай, -- подтолкнула локтем свинка. -- Хрю-хрю ! -- закричал Чонкин, изображая на лице своем черзвычай- ный восторг. -- Погоди, - оборвал Плечевой. Ты только делаешь вид, что тебе нравит- ся, а на самом деле ты недоволен. Но мы не хотим, чтоб ты делал это против воли, мы хотим, чтоб тебе это нравилось по-настоящему. Ну-ка, давай-ка вместе. Хрю-хрю ! ® In several passages Čonkin declares he is a human being; he is his own person, not a pig or any other sort of animal. Although Čonkin willy-nilly conforms to cer- tain social norms because he is told to, he refuses to identify with the dream pigs against his will. He does begin to think, but it gets him into trouble. Čonkin's prob- lems begin when Beauty, the cow, destroys the entire ПУКС garden that belongs to Gladféev. Vojnovič thus destroys the myth through this "revolutionary" act that does away with the unattainable future. It is a cow which commits this "crime" against the State, the "Garden of Eden," socialism or whatever label, not a human being. It must be pointed out that the animals also (Bor'ka, Beauty and Osoavia- khim) are referred to in terms of scatological details. Bor'ka, being a pig, takes the brunt of physical abuse as well as insults. Vet Bor'ka, Beauty and Osoaviakhim possess anthropomorphic features; they are "human," especially to Njurka who needs human companionship. The situation is such that Čonkin becomes jealous of 148</page><page sequence="5">a pig, whom the author endows with several human characteristics that are general enough to be applied to all human beings. For example, after Čonkin has hit Bor'ka on the snout, the author states: Надо было видеть, с какой готовностью забыл Борька незаслуженную обиду и кинулся к хозяину, как радостно он визжал и хрюкал, тыча рылом Чонкина в бок, всем своим видом как бы говоря: "Я не знаю, в чем я перед тобой виноват, но я виноват, если ты так считаешь. Побей меня за это, убей, если хочешь, только прости." ® Njurka is a sensitive human being attached to her pet pig and cow. It is her cow who rebels against the system; after all, it is this system that drains her of her milk. It would, of course, have been a more obvious symbol if Bor'ka the pig had uprooted Gladisev's ПУКС. And it is Osoaviakhim, the horse, which appears in Gladisev's dream, and rebels against his state of being: -- Как же тебе удалось-то стать человеком, Ося ? -- Да оно вишь как получилось, -- задумчиво сказал Осоавиахим, - я в последнее время много работал. Сам знаешь, и продукты возил со склада, и навозом не брезговал, и пахать приходилось -- ни от чего не отказывался, и вот в результате кропотливого труда превратился я наконец, в человека. ^ Thus, Vojnoviž establishes the analogy between man and beast. The role of Oso- aviakhim, although a minor one, is important in several respects. Osoaviakhim is killed by the Red Army which is trying to capture Čonkin. The occurrences are so closely tied that the analogy between the death of man (Osoaviakhim) and beast (Ivan Čonkin) is clear. It is not the death of an animal that we mourn, but that of a decent, but ignorant, human being who was made into a workhorse for the State. Osoaviakhim stands for the acronym of Society for Assistance to the Defense, Aviation and Chemical Construction of the U.S.S.R. Again VojnoviČ wages war on the grandeur of words and myths by bringing them down to the level of manure- horse manure. Interestingly enough, it is the Red Army which is supposed to assist. Such a system, VojnoviČ, I think, is saying is self-destructive because it does not concern itself with the welfare of its citizens, who are as dispensable as Osoavia- khim. Such a system only pretends to care. Pigs symbolize the devil, man's vanities, and everything that smells of пош- лость in Gogol"s works. In VojnoviČ, however, the pig Bor'ka is a decent "human" being who comforts Njurka. The people have been brought down to the level of pigs as čonkin's dream will attest to. Yet the common people, though they appear ignorant because of the system that makes them so, are not exactly fools. Wisdom surfaces, and no matter how "bestial" some of the people have become through the system, they retain human feelings and emotions which help them atone for past acts of cruelty and guilt. When one of the characters, Revkin, is fearful about some- thing he might have done, his wife expresses concern about his state of mind. Soon after this human exchange, the author makes the following comment: 149</page><page sequence="6">Она не всегда понимала гуманную линию партии, не разрешавшей унич- тожать всех не месте. Теперь Аглая заведовала детским домом. ® People go through various superficial acts like robots, but somewhere a human spark remains. Revkin's wife managed a children's home, yet soon after this, she suggests that her husband turn himself in to the agency, a representative of the system. The agency operates on the smile-slap principle, and it is also "concerned" about its people's security. Who are these men who run these organizations ? Voj- novic clearly reduces them to the level of pigs as they arrive covered with mud and muck into the village of Krasnoe where they hope to arrest Conkin who had been de- nounced as a deserter by Gladišev. But Conkin, a loyal-minded person, is not about to move from the post he has been assigned. Conkin arrests the men from the agency and turns them into uprooting beasts of burden in a sudden reversal of roles, čonkin is a human being in charge of pigs. The potatoes these beings are uprooting suddenly show up in the market place to the bewilderment of party members and the people themselves who have been fed so many lies in the papers they cannot accept the reality of concrete objects. Čonkin turns lies into truths and becomes an involuntary hero. Vojnovic again, through an act of "rebellion," seems to be critical of slogans and words that pervert. Vojnovic continues to drag the agency and its representatives through muck and mud. When the arrest of Conkin does not take place, Captain Miljaga goes after his men. He, too, is captured and made to work in the fields. He escapes, however, by crawling through muck until he is covered with it beyond recognition. Captain Miljaga is captured by the Red Army soldiers and dragged in. As he revives, the captain overhears the soldiers speaking German; he turns to German also. Again Vojnovic is dealing with words-words which express lies. As Captain Miljaga tries to explain himself, the general asks what kind of Russian he is speaking. It is precisely what the author has been saying throughout the novel. Language has a specific purpose between human beings; it should be used to communicate clearly and truthfully. Many of the characters are concerned with proper form-proper letters with official seals, statistical charts that must be turned in as proof of labor performed even though no labor has been performed; newspapers report "fantastic" accounts of labor feats. Everything on paper, words, slogans, ideologies, charts and people's speeches are distorted to the point that Stalin's voice blends with a singer's on the radio, Vojnovič wages war against the perversion of man and the lies that are used to embellish an unattainable ideal. Through scatological details, animal imagery and extended meaning, Vojno- vič has reduced the entire Soviet system to the level of Gladisev's "WATER-CLOSET." The people, however, are still human, especially Ivan and Njurka who share a love relationship as important as Romeo and Juliet's. Vojnovic points out that once the Institution was gone, the people were living, working, having children and dying-all without the knowledge of the proper agencies. People in Vojnovic's novel, as everywhere, have the potential to be human and humane, but they are prevented from being so because they must, in general, 150</page><page sequence="7">conform to the mediocrity that comes from above. Man does not need perverted ideas, institutions or nonsensical words. What is important is the life process: human needs are neither political nor intellectual. NOTES 1. Jae Num Lee.
