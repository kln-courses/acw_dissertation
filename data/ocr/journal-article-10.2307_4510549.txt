Matthews reviews the experimental work on "the manner in which birds find their way in unknown country; their navigation" (p. 1) and concludes that: "The reality of navigational ability in birds its an estab- lished fact. No theory of the physical basis of bird navigation remains in the field except that involving the sun. This the evidence strongly supports, and the only type of sun navigation that fits the observed facts and is satisfactory from the logical point of view is that proposed by the sun-arc hypothesis." (p. 120) The sun-arc hypothesis assumes that: "At home the bird will become familiar with the features of the sun-arc [the path followed by the sun through the sky] and the sun's position on it at different (local) times. These will be related to the internal 'chronometer' which is also an essential part of the hypothesis. In unfamiliar surroundings the bird will have to construct the sun-arc from obser- vation. The suggestion is that it observes the sun's movement over a small part of its arc and extrapolates to obtain the highest point. Measurement of the alti- tude of this point, the angle from the horizontal, and comparison with the re- membered value for home, say, the previous day, will give the latitude change. The arc angle from the observed sun to this highest point when compared with that obtaining at home for the same chronometer time will give the longitude change. An alternative means of latitude determination would be for the bird to extrapolate the arc back to its base, and to measure the inclination of the arc directly." (pp. 93-94.) Once the bird had established the sun-arc, it would fly in the direction necessary tolbring the observed sun-arc in coincidence with the remembered sun-arc. In chapters 5, 6, and 7 of this book Matthews examines lother hypotheses at- tempting to explain navigational ability (e.g. magnetic grid, Coriolis force) and to his own satisfaction, proves them all untenable. This review examines the sun-arc hypothesis in the same manner and using the same criteria. The sun-arc hypothesis demands that the navigating bird be able to measure the altitude of the sun above the horizon to within 1° of arc or less. This requires that (a) the bird be able to measure large angles (up to 90°) with this accuracy and (b) the Ibird has an artificial horizon which will serve as a datum for the measurement. Matthews cites (p. 108) evidence that the bird's eye can discriminate within 10" of arc, but cites none to indicate that birds can measure large angles or discriminate between different large angles. The human eye can also discriminate between very small angles, but i5 quite inadequate in visual estimation of large vertical angles. (To the human eye the vault of the sky appears as a flattened dome, not as a hemisphere, as it should if vertical angles of celestial bodies are to be estimated accurately.) Matthews points out (p. 109): "Additional confidence in the possibility of a flying bird being a,ble to measure small angles with great accuracy is given by the quite extraordinary stability of the bird's head in flapping flight . . . the head, by virture of an extremely fine compensating mechanism based on the semi- circular canals, proceeds forward with a rocklike constancy." He feels that this ability which has been observed but not measured, "enables us to credit the bird with the equivalent of the 'artificial horizon' or 'bubble sextant' which enables human air navigators to measure vertical angles without reference to the visible horizon." Here we are asked to accept the bird's ability to maintain its horizontal datum while in flight to within at least 1°, yet no experimental data are cited in proof. Maintaining this horizontal datum means that the bird must be able to determine the true vertical, the direction of the acceleration of gravity, at any time. In practice this would be impossible since other accelerations experienced by the bird in flight would, in effect, deflect the apparent vertical. Air navigators allow for this constant change in the apparent vertical by integrating observations over a period of time, thus allowing the effect of the transient accelerations to cancel out. Matthews himself recognizes that transient accelerations will be present, in his discussion of measurement of Coriolis force. In his discussion of the possibility that the bird obtains its directional refer- ence from the sun's azimuth position, he states (p. 68) "we must credit the birds</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXVII Recent Literature [49 1956 with possession of the equivalent of a complete nautical almanac, making the necessary corrections automatically. This would seem to be unreasonable." Credit- ing the birds with the possession of an integrating sextant seems equally unrea- sonable. The only alternative is a rapidly rotating gyroscope which would always provide the bird with an absolute vertical reference and, as Matthews points out, this is "an anatomical impossibility." (p. 107) From this discussion it would seem that the most favorable decision we can give on the bird's ability to measure the sun's angular altitude above the horizon is "not proven." But, assuming that the bird can make this measurement, what can we say about its probable ability to extrapolate three or more observations of the sun to determine the highest point of the sun-arc? Matthews feels that this extra- polation does not present any special problem as "Extrapolation of the path of moving objects is essential in birds feeding on moving prey." (p. 116) Yet, human air navigators obtaining a position by a meridian observation (determina- tion of the sun's position at local noon) find it necessary to make observations both before and after the sun has reached its highest point. The highest point of the extrapolated curve is very difficult to determine, even when plotted on graph paper, because the sun's change in altitude with time is very slow around local noon. Again we must say "not proven." Again assuming that what is not proved is yet possible, what abilities would the bird need to translate its estimated position of the sun's highest point on the extrapolated arc into a longitude determination accurate to within 60 miles? To do this the bird would have to measure the arc between the observed position of the sun and its estimated noon position to within one degree of arc, if its chrono- meter were absolutely accurate, or have a chronometer accurate to within 4 minutes of time if the measurement of arc were absolutely accurate. None of the experi- ments cited confirms either of these abilities. As Matthews says, "We need in- formation on the nature and accuracy of these chronometers independently of their function in orientation." (p. 119.) Here too, it would seem that the bird's capability to perform as required by the sun-arc hypothesis would require abilities that the bird has not been proved to possess. In spite of the lack of experimental data to prove that the bird has the sensory equipment necessary to navigate by reference to the sun-arc, Matthews believes that he has experimental evidence to prove the hypothesis. In an experiment with pigeons he interrupted the normal day-night illumination cycle by keeping the birds from view of the sky for 6 to 9 days, meanwhile transporting them to an unfamiliar location. He claims that the majority of the conditioned birds released flew in the direction where the sun-arc would be the same as when they last saw it. A control group of pigeons, which had full view to the sun and sky during the same period of incarceration, flew in the true home direction. Matthews says (p. 102), "The results are statistically reliable and allow of no explanation other than that of the hypothesis." Perhaps a study of topography of the release point in comparison to the re- lease point where the birds were originally trained and of the weather during the experiment might result in an explanation "other than that of the hypothe- sis." Griffin in the Quarterly Review of Biology, 19: 21-32 (1944) suggests several ecological clues which might canalize a bird's search for its home. Matthews re- gards these suggestions as "little more than anthropomorphic guesswork," but many of his readers, particularly those who distrust statistics when applied to organisms with the power of decision, might not agree. It is unfortunate that Matthews does not give the full details of the experiment in this book. As reported here, the experiment involves an unspecified number of pigeons, flying over undescribed terrain, in unknown weather. Although full data are given for many less important experiments, the interested reader will have to consult the original paper for details on this crucial experiment. It is also unfortunate that Matthews does not report on the results of the same experiment when conducted by Rawson and Rawson and by Kramer. Matthews lists the papers on both experiments as ("in the press") but does not report that in both cases the results obtained contradicted the results he obtained, which he claims were "statistically reliable and allowed of no explanation other than that of the hypothesis."</page><page sequence="3">Bird-Banding 50] Recent Literature January In reading this book one gets the impression that Matthews regards field ob- servations, especially field observations of migratory birds, as a somewhat untidy form of scientific endeavor. He recognizes the inherent inaccuracy of his own method of observing flight directions of released homing birds, but puts his faith in statistics, saying (p. 37) "from a large number of vanishing points under a given set of conditions, a scatter diagram is built up whose orientation or lack of it, can be accepted with statistical confidence." Yet he dismisses Lowery's method of observing the passage of birds across the moon's disk, which gives a direction of flight for a migrating bird in its natural environment, in a paragraph. He states (p. 5), "the effects of wind, though important, are incidental" although in his measurements of vanishing points cited above, a relatively light wind could have a statistically significant effect on his scatter diagram unless the experi- mental birds are able to compensate for drift when flying an instrument heading. He closes the book with the observation that "It also seems probable that field experiments of the type we have been describing have reached their useful end, except, perhaps for trans-equatorial tests. For further progress the problem will have to be brought into the laboratory." Matthews does not offer a convincing explanation of the role the sun-arc plays in the orientation of birds flying at night. He suggests: (p. 65) "The direction of the night's flight could be determined from the sun during the day, or about sunset and maintained as well as possible throughout the darkness with reference to topography, and possibly some general guidance from the moon and star pat- tern," but does not explain how a passerine bird on an overwater migration could maintain direction by reference to topography. This book will be of interest to anyone interested in the mechanics of bird navigation. The chapters summarizing previous work in this field will be an in- valuable reference to those who do not have access to an ornithological library. Perhaps the best evaluation of his exposition of the sun-arc hypothesis is given by Matthews himself in his Preface, "The path of progress in this field is littered with discarded theories and it is possible that the one at present favoured may be found inadequate."-William H.

In 1932 Horst Siewert's notable book on the biology of the Black and White Storks appeared; it was illustrated with 80 of his fine photographs. Now Rolf Dirksen has re- published most of the text and 23 of the plates (the others were destroyed during the War). The additions consist of seven photographs taken by others, a sympa- thetic chapter on the life of the author, scientific chapters on range and change of status of the White Stork, and its migration, homing and age, and two pages of bibliography. Thus we have a valuable and up-to-date contribution to orni- thology, written with insight and deep love for the wild.-M. M. Nice. 53. Prairie Ducks. Lyle K. Sowles. 1955.

In 1944 Albert Hochbaum published his notable "Canvasback on a Prairie Marsh" de- voted largely to the diving ducks on Delta Marsh at Delta, Manitoba. Now comes the companion volume treating the five species of puddle ducks nesting at Delta Marsh. Both books are illustrated with Al Hochbaum's inimitable sketches. Dr. Sowles spent 5 years-1946 to 1950-on this problem. A vast amount of valuable factual material is presented on migration and spring arrival, homing, home range and territoriality, nesting terrain, nesting season, nesting behavior, mortality, renesting-a subject on which the author found much new and definite information-hen and brood behavior, autumn behavior, and the shooting season. In regard to predator control campaigns, when one is reduced, another usually increases. "Methods to control all the predators in our wild waterfowl marshes have so far been found to be ineffective and costly," (p. 127). Renesting "is a compensating factor for early season predator loss." In Table 14 (p. 97), there is an obvious misprint in the incubation period of the Barn Owl; it should be 32-34 days, not 14 days. The incubation period of the Carolina Chickadee is longer than 11 days; that of the Song Sparrow (p. 133) is 12-13, not 11-12.
