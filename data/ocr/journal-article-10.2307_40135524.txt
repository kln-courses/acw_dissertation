It is not often that writers nowadays write fairy tales, nor are they taken seriously when they do. Yet such writers as Isaac Bashevis Singer have tried, rather successfully, their pen at this unusual genre that is normally relegated to oral literature or folklore. Grozdana Olujic, a novelist and short- story writer translated into many languages, including En- glish, has written a book of fairy tales, Sedefna ruza i druge bajke (A Mother-of-Pearl Rose and Other Fairy Tales), that are both conventional and unique. Conventional in them is the standard repertory of a fairly-tale world - witches, en- chanted princesses, giants, tiny people, anthropomorphism, et cetera. One also encounters the removal of the border lines between reality and fantasy, a willing suspension of disbelief and a moral that can frequently be drawn from the story. Unique features are, above all, an emotional approach to the subject matter, a poetic tone and an enlivened style by way of frequent question marks, exclamation points, repeti- tions and other stylistic elements not usually found in a fairy tale. As a result, we have a collection of charming tales that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. As is always the case, not all stories in the collection are of anthological value, but several of the fairy tales stand out. The title story expresses a yearning for beauty that can be found only in the exalted regions. "Mesecev cvet ' (The Moon's Flower) is a variation on the same theme, except that it ends happily - as most fairy tales do - when a sickly boy regains good health and looks by searching for and finding the Moon's flower. "Ogledalo " (Mirror) treats the age-old subject of a desire for immortality and of all the problems that result when the wish is miraculously granted. "Varalica i smrt" (The Swindler and Death) is a typical fairy tale, although here too the author twists the expected outcome. "Zvono koje je opominjalo" (The Bell That Warned) is a charming moralistic tale of a man's love for birds and of punishments meted out to those who mistreat them. The most poetic of the tales, "Stolica sa planine " (A Chair from the Mountain), is an apotheosis of the beauty and goodness of nature and the ennoblement it brings to people. Several of these fairy tales deserve to be translated, as they probably will be. Judging by the universality and enthusiasm with which they were written, Olujic has composed this book for all people and for all ages. It should reach as far as the author's intentions. Vasa D.
