<plain_text><page sequence="1">1905 July - December ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS' SUMMARIES OF ORIGINAL ARTICLES CHIEFLY IN CURRENT PERIODICALS HAROLD N. FOWLER, Editor Western Reserve University, Cleveland, O. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Terra Sigillata. - At the May (1905) meeting of the Berlin Arch. Ge- sellsch., H. DRAGENDORFF spoke on the history of terra sigillata. Origi- nating in Asia Minor, the style was brought to Italy about 200 B.c. and reached its highest development at Arretiuin about the time of the Roman occupation of Gaul and the Rhine, where it was imitated and mixed with characteristics of other styles in the local provincial ware. In the first cen- tury after Christ Arretine ware was superseded even in Italy by a rival ware with similar forms but a new style of decoration, made chiefly at Banassac in southern France, and this in turn gave place in the provinces to the ware of Lezoux-sur-Allier, while vessels of metal came into use in Italy. The manufacture at Lezoux lasted until the destruction of the town by German barbarians. The German-Roman border camps used also a ware from Rhein- zabern and various local fabrics. There was throughout a gradual debase- ment of the style, and the relief ware was finally replaced by jugs with mere branched ornament resembling Frankish and Alemannic pottery. (Arch.

X, 1906 engines by a Saxon officer, Major Schramm, in Metz, are to be followed by further attempts under the same auspices, with the aid of the director of the Saalburg Museum and an antiquarian society in Metz. The Campana Collection.- In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 161-163 (2 figs.), S. REINACH publishes some additional notes from various sources on the history of the Campana collection. Pliny's Journalist Methods. - A second paper on Pliny's use of a cen- sor's list of the year 73 in making his citations of works of art in Rome with classification by Regions of the city, in N. H. XXXIV-XXXVI, is published by D. DETLEFSON in Jb. Arch. I. XX, 1905, pp. 113-122. See ibid. XVI, pp. 75-107. Xerxes and the Hellespont. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 1-14, S. REINACH argues that the acts of Xerxes in beating the Hellespont and throwing fet- ters into it were ritual acts. The iron sunk in the sea by the Phocaeans, the ring of Polycrates, the ring of Minos, the marriage of the doge of Venice with the Adriatic, and other similar acts are cited in comparison. Ancient City Life. - A discussion of some phases of the city life of Per- gamon and of Priene as typical ancient cities is given by F. KOEPP in Arch. A nz. 1905, pp. 141-149. Of the three usual stages of development domi- nated respectively by the need of security, by an expanding municipal activity, and by an ideal of ease and comfort, Priene represents almost ex- clusively the second, here the Hellenistic stage, for its acropolis, the first place to be inhabited on any ancient site, is wholly above and separate from this second town, and city life had died out here before Roman domination made it safe to expand beyond walls. Pergamon, on the contrary, lived through all three stages, and much of the evidence of the two earlier ones is obscured or destroyed by the last. Both cities show the splendid achieve- ments of the IHellenistic city spirit, whether the inmpulse came from a powerful ruling family like the Attalids or from plain citizens. The high- pressure water system of Pergamon, which the Romans were forced to adopt but could not keep up in its original efficiency, is especially admirable. Neolithic Burial. - In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 145-161 (15 figs.), GEORGE CLINCH briefly describes and discusses neolithic tombs and monuments, chiefly those in England. Archaeology and the Bible. - In Rec. Past, IV, 1905, August, pp. 234- 242 (fig.), eJOHN EASTER, reviewing the relations of archaeological discov- eries to the Bible finds that they are in harmony. Archaeology in Croatia. - The Vjesnikl of the Croatian Archaeological Society of Agram (Zagreb), vol. VIII, 1905 (237 pp.; 170 figs.), contains thir- teen articles, an obituary sketch of the life of Ivan Krstitelj Tkaleid, reports, notes, and indexes. J. BRUNSMID (pp. 35-106; 132 figs.) continues his fully illustrated catalogue of the objects of marble and stone in the museum at Agramn, most of which are more or less fragmentary works of Roman date found in Croatia. There are several Greek inscriptions, the most interest- ing of which is the decree from Kor'ula, with list of colonists, published in Dittenberger's Sylloge, II 2, p. 792, No. 933. BRUNxMID also (pp. 176-192; 9 figs.) describes some discoveries of coins, some of which are Roman, others mediaeval and later, in Croatia and Slavonia, and (pp. 208-220; 8 figs.) early mediaeval antiquities, chiefly fibulae, from Croatia and Slavonia. V. HOF- FILLER discusses (pp. 118-128; 8 figs.) a votive relief of lead from Ser-</page><page sequence="3">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 179 bisch-Mitrovica, a relief of lead from Divo' (pp. 204-207; 2 figs.), and a prehistoric necropolis in Smiljan near Gospic (pp. 193-203; 5 figs.). V. KLAIC writes of the Croatian kingdom in the fifteenth century and the first quarter of the sixteenth, 1409-1526 (pp. 129-147), and the coronation of the Arpad princes as kings of Dalmatia and Croatia, 1091-1207 (pp. 107-117). B. KRNIC publishes and discusses a document of Zagreb (Agram) of the year 1482 (pp. 159-164). I. MILCETI publishes three Glagolitic documents of the fifteenth century (pp. 30-33). F. SIdId writes of the death of the Croatian King Zvonimir (pp. 1-29). M. VASIC publishes a bronze vessel in the form of a bust of a youth from Virninacium (pp. 148-158; 5 figs.). N. VULIC publishes two Roman epitaphs from Montenegro. EGYPT The Stele of the King Serpent. - In f[on. Me'm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 5-17 (pl. ; 6 figs.), G. BPIN1iDITE publishes and discusses the stele from Abydos, now in the Louvre, upon which is the Horus name (Ka name, Banner name) of a king whose other name is unknown. The stele is 0.18 m. thick, 0.65 m. wide, and was originally 2.50 m. or 2.60 m. high, but is now only 1.45 m. in height. It probably stood as a visible monument above the tomb. It is an original work of the pre-Memphite period, not a later imitation. It is adorned on the front with the hawk standing upon a rectangular foundation in the upper part of which is the serpent, while the lower part is occupied by the representation of a building (two doors and three towers). This last is the tomb, or perhaps the palace, of the king. Such representations may have their origin from a tribe with the hawk as its token, which at some very early period conquered Egypt. The Decoration of the Vases of the Neggadeh Period.- In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1905, pp. 257-278 (3 figs.), G. FOUCART shows that the conven- tional representations on the vases of the Neggadeh period constitute almost a hieroglyphic system and serve the same purpose as the inscriptions of later times, insuring for the deceased a share in the festivals of the gods and the necessary nourishment in the future life. Egyptian Chronology. - In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, cols. 473- 483, E. MAHLER contests the conclusion of Edouard Meyer in his recent Egyptian Chronology, that the day of the Sothis festival fell always upon the 19th of July of the Julian year; and shows that the Sirius year did not correspond with the Julian year and that the Heliacal rising of Sirius in ninth year of King Ptolemy Euergetes recorded in the decree of Canopus must not be identified with the 19th of July of the Julian year. He con- cludes that the older calculations of Oppolzer are more accurate than those of Meyer, and that the Sothis periods in their earlier occurrences fell several years earlier than Meyer assumes. The Mastaba of Gem-mi-kai. - The first volume has appeared of an exhaustive and elaborate publication of a fine mastaba built under the first king of the sixth dynasty, which was excavated by Do Morgan thirteen years ago. The second volume is soon to be published. The sculptures and inscriptions are carefully reproduced and discussed. Apparently the sculptors of the reliefs had books of patterns, from which they copied their</page><page sequence="4">180 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 designs. Some of the hieroglyphic inscriptions were probably also con- tained in these books, and were perhaps not always understood by the copyists. Such publications preserve the material which is important for the study of history and art even if the original monument is exposed to destruction. (F. W. v. BISSING and A. E. P. WEIGALL, Die 3Mastaba des Gemmi-kai, vol. 1, Berlin, 1905, A. Dunker. 42 pp.; 33 pls.; figs. Folio. Two volumes, 50 M.) Pronunciation and Correct Method of Transcription of Egyptian. - In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, cols. 313-323, 361-371, 413-423, W. M. MULLER criticises the current methods of transcribing Egyptian. The older method of Lepsius, that is still used in England and France, is far behind the present state of Egyptological science, and the so-called Berlin method that was introduced in the Zeitschrift fiir Aegyptologie in 1889 marks an advance, but uses a different system from that used at present in the Se- mitic languages. This causes a constant confusion. The author maintains that a uniform system should be used for the Egyptian and for the Semitic languages, and points out what are the proper equivalents in Roman char- acters of the different Egyptian signs. Magic Ivories of the Middle Empire. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXVII, 1905 (17 pls.), F. LEGGE discusses some fifty flat pieces of ivory carved with singular figures that are found in different Egyptian museums in Europe, Africa, and America. They are all made from the point of the tusk of the elephant or hippopotamus, and, as far as is known, they have come from the neighborhood of Thebes. They represent a procession of sacred animals, and seem to be designed to depict the march of the sun, either across the sky or through the underworld. The solar emblem appears in every one, and is accompanied with figures connected with solar legends. These wands were made for magical protection, probably against the bites of serpents. The names of the persons for whom they were made indicate that they ranged through a period from the twelfth to the four- teenth dynasty. Egyptian Silver Statuettes. - In Proc. Soc. Ant. XX, 1904, pp. 97-103 (9 figs.), F. G. HILTON PRICE publishes, with notes: (1) a small statuette of a sphinx with the cartouche of Sequenen-Ra of the seventeenth dynasty, (2-5) statuettes of Thoth, Bast, An-heru, and Taurt or Thoueris, the dates of which are not given, and (6) the kneeling figure of a king or prince holding a vase in each hand, ascribed to the eighteenth dynasty. All the statuettes are of silver. The Tomb of Ioua and Tioua. - In The Century, November, 1905, pp. 72-76 (pl.; 21 figs.), H. C. GREENE gives an account of the discovery of the tomb of the parents of Queen Taia (Tii), in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings, with a description of its contents. (See Am. J. Arch. 1905, p. 339.) Gold Bars for Coinage. - In Proc. Soc. Ant. XX, 1904, pp. 90-97 (4 figs.), two Roman gold bars for coinage from Aboukir, Egypt (cf Arch. Anz. 1902, p. 46), are published with notes by G. F. HILL. They are now in the British Museum. On one are two stamps: (1) ... ANTIVSI ACVEPPSIG I. ROBAVIT and SPMOY [ ERMOV, i.e.... antius I A(ulus) C(aecilius) Ve(stinus) p(rae)positus sig(navit) I (p)robavit, the first word being a proper name and belonging with probavit, and 'Ep/ov (w6roXEw).</page><page sequence="5">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 181 These interpretations are suggested by SEYMOUR DE RICCI. On the second bar is inscribed: Benignuls coxit. The Identity of the Hero of the Egyptian Tale of the Two Broth- ers.-In S. Bibl. Arch. XXVII, 1905, pp. 185-186, A. H. GARDINER dis- cusses a passage in a hieratic ostracon in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries in Edinburgh which speaks of Barta, when he was in the arms of Bast, being cast out of every land. From this he infers that Barta was originally a mythological figure, and that the actors in the "Tale of the Two Brothers" are divine personages, and the incidents are derived from mythological traditions of the Egyptians. The mythological spirit has, however, been largely lost, and the story is told as though it were an ordinary historical episode. Ancient Egyptian Mast-heads. - In 'ET. 'Apx. 1905 (pp. 157-160; p1. 4), FR. W. VON BISSING publishes two nearly cylindrical hollow bronze caps nearly a metre long with rings on the sides for stays, etc., in the Egyptian collection of the National Museum at Athens. As one bears a dedicatory inscription in hieroglyphics to Onouris and Hathor, it seems probable that they once terminated the masts of two sacred ships. Egyptian Imitations of Athenian Coins. - In J. Int. A rch. Numn. VIII, 1905, pp. 103-114 (3 p1s.), G. DATTARI describes and discusses a hoard of Athenian tetradrachms found near Benha, in Egypt, in December, 1903. Many of the coins are countermarked. Many of them (130 of the 240 preserved from the entire hoard of 700) are apparently not of Attic work- manship, but were struck in Egypt, perhaps by King Tachos, B.c. 364. A die was found on the same mound where the coins were discovered. Perhaps other coins besides the Attic tetradrachins were struck in Egypt. Greek Mummy Labels in the British Museum. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXVII, 1905, pp. 115-122 and 159-165 (pl.), H. R. HALL continues the description of Greek mummy labels in the British Museum begun in the preceding two numbers of the same journal. He gathers a large collection of new names, partly Greek and partly Egyptian, and throws much light upon the syncretism that went on in Egypt during the Greek period between the Greek and Egyptian religions. The Ethical Papyrus of Leyden. - In J. Asiat. X, 1905, pp. 193-249, M. E. REVILLOUT publishes in hieroglyphic text and translation the first part of the famous Ethical Papyrus of Leyden. This papyrus is written in demotic, which offers so great difficulties to the student that the editor has deemed it best to transpose it into hieroglyphic. It is a unique collection of proverbs and sage counsels that bear a striking resemblance to the literature of the ancient Hebrews. The Aramaic Papyrus from Elephantine. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXVII, 1905. pp. 187-188, C. H. W. JOHNS discusses the Aramaic papyrus published ibid. XV, 1903, pp. 202 ff. The difficult word nbz in line 6, he suggests, is the same as the nibzu which appears in one of the Assyrian letters published by R. F. Harper. Here apparently it means "receipt." The Dating of the Fayum Portraits. - The periods currently assigned to the panel-portraits of Greek mummies are either too early (Ebers) or too late (Petrie). They can be dated in most cases by the manner of wearing the hair, and are all of the Roman period, from the time of Claudius well on into the third century. They are the product of long-practised Hellenistic</page><page sequence="6">182 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 art applied to a new purpose without any experimental period, while the modelled masks of plaster, cartonnage, etc., which began to be used some- what earlier, are of Egyptian origin and marked a wholly new departure. Both kinds of portrait were in use at the same time, one or the other being preferred at different places. (C. C. EDGAR, J. H. S. XXV, 1905, pp. 225-233; pl.) BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA The Influence of Babylonia and Assyria upon the Coasts of the Medi- terranean. - In Der Alte Orient, VII, part 2, H. WVINCKLER discusses the re- lations of Babylonia and Assyria to the West-land from the earliest times down to the fall of Babylon. He shows that in the third millennium before Christ Babylonian influence was paramount throughout the countries at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, and that the so-called Mycenaean art owes its development to Babylonian influence; that the Phoenician civilization was essentially of Babylonian origin, and that through Phoenician commerce this civilization was disseminated through all the countries bordering upon the Mediterranean. In the Assvyrian period the same influences were at work, and Babylonian learning was continually passed along to the nations of the west and became the starting point of the intellectual life of Greece. Babylonian Method of Naming the Years. -In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, cols. 268-273, L. MESSERSCHMIDT publishes a tablet of the reign of Samsuditana, in which the name of the year is determined by an event which occurred on the first day of the month Nisan, and in which was also an abbreviated designation by which the year was ordinarily known. He infers that the name was given to the year from the first important event which occurred in it; and that notices of this name were sent into all the provinces. Places that were remote from the capital and received the news late continued to number by the previous year until the news of the new name reached them. Two New Babylonian Kings. - In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, cols. 5- 12 and cols. 5-13, E. SCHEIL publishes two Babylonian texts containing the new royal names of Ibiq-Istar, king of Malgi, and of Salamana. Meaning of the Ring and the Rod in Babylonian Sculpture. --In Bibl. World, XXVI, 1905, pp. 120-123, A. E. WIIATHAM discusses the ring and the rod that appear frequently as attributes of divinities in the Baby- lonian sculptures. He comes to the conclusion that the rod is a symbol of authority and that the circle represents the orb of the world. The Dog of King Soumou Ilou.--In M!on. Mem. A cad. Insc. (Fon- dation Piot), XII, pp. 19-28 (pl.; 2 figs.), L. HEUZEY publishes and discusses a figure of a recumbent mastiff only 0.105 m. in length, which was found at Tello, and is now in the Louvre. On the body of the dog is a dedication to the goddess Nin-Isin for the life of Soumou Ilou, king of Ur, by Abba-dougga, hierophant (?), son of Ouroukaghina. The inscription seems to date from a time not long before Hammurabi. In the back of the dog a hole was made at a later time into which a cylindrical vase of steatite was fitted. An Archaic Axe-head in the Pierpont Morgan Collection. - In J. Am. Or. S. XXVI, pp. 93-97, J. D. PRINCE discusses an ancient Babylonian axe-head of agate, once the property of Cardinal Borgia, and recently pre-</page><page sequence="7">BABYLONIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 183 sented by Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan to the American Museum of Natural His- tory. It bears an inscription reading " Kahattish, the favorite of the gods, presented this." The characters are archaic, approaching those of the Gudea period, but are slightly more wedge-shaped than the Gudea characters. This shows that the inscription belongs somewhere between the period of Gudea and that of HIammurabi. Proper Names of the Period of the First Dynasty of Babylon. - In the Expository Times, XVII, 1905, pp. 29-31, A. H. SAYCE discusses the volume on early Babylonian personal names by H. RANKE, Philadelphia, 1905. He comments on the occurrence of such Hebrew names as Reuben, Noah, Jeshurun, Jerahmeel, Jacob, etc., and the connection of this fact with the history of early Semitic migrations. The divine name Yahu is also discussed. A New Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar. - In Mitth. Vorderas. Ges. X, 1905, pp. 304-305, B. MlEISSNER gives an account, with transcription, tratis- literation, and translation, of a new inscription of Nebuchadnezzar's, de- scribing how he adorned the road to the Sanctuary with tiles. This inscription is interesting on account of its connection with the discoveries of the German expedition in Babylon. Meaning of the Sign NI-GIS. - In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905. col. 247, B. MEISSNER discusses the value of the ideogram NI-GIS and concludes that it does not mean " olive oil " or " castor oil," as has been supposed, but " sesame oil. " Hatamti, A Land mentioned in an Elamite Inscription. - In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, col. 250, V. SCHEIL maintains that the reading Hatamti is correct instead of Hapirti, and gives in transliteration and tran- scription the text of the King Sutruk Nahhunte in which this country is mentioned. A New Variety of Archaic Elamite Writing.--In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, col. 323, F. BORK discusses the new variety of writing discovered by the French expedition at Susa and published in the sixth volume of the texts. Two of the inscriptions are written with lines and several hundred small tablets in a sort of cuneiform. Although the characters resemble one another, it is possible that we have to deal here with two independent sorts of writing. Bork concludes from the number and arrangement of the signs that this is probably a syllabic system of writing. On the assumption that the Babylonian text is parallel to one of the proto-Elamite texts he attempts a translation of one of the tablets. The Deities of Ancient Elam.- In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, Cols. 385-390, G. ItUsING discusses a recent article on the same subject by Genouillac in the Receuil de Traraux and proposes a number of emen- dations and additions to the list of 66 names there presented. A Selection of Hymns and Prayers. - In Der A Ite Orient, VII, 1905, Part 3, II. ZIM.1ERN gives a choice collection of translations of Babylonian hymns. Many of these appeared previously in his book of Babylonian Peni- tential Psalms, published in 1885, but the new translations represent the results of new criticism of the texts and the progress of Assyriology during the last twenty-five years. The hymns are arranged in such a form as to bring out their parallelism and strophic structure. They contain psalms of thanksgiving for victory, praises of the king, and prayers for the king,</page><page sequence="8">184 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 hymns to the various deities, prayers offered at sacrifices, laments, magical formulas, penitential psalms, etc. Marriage at Babylon. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1905, pp. 210-214, E. CoQ discusses marriage at Babylon according to the laws of Hammurabi. SYRIA AND PALESTINE The Second North Wall of Jerusalem. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, Quarterly Statement, XXXVII, 1905, pp. 231-242, C. W. WILSON discusses the problem of the course of the second north wall of Jerusalem and comes to the conclu- sion that Shick's theory is untenable. The older theory which makes the wall run due north from David Street parallel to Christian Street to a point north of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre he also rejects and concludes that no certain trace of a second wall has yet been found, though possibly one or other of the masses of masonry found in the lines just mentioned may have belonged to this wall. Archaeological History of Jerusalem. - In the Expositor, VI, 1905, pp. 1-17, 215-233, 336-350, 303-320, G. A. SMITH gives a history of Jerusalem in the time of Isaiah, at the time of Sennacherib's campaign, in the period of Deuteronomy, and during the reign of Manasseh, and incidentally dis- cusses the building operations that were undertaken by Hezekiah and Manas- seh, and their identification with existing remains. Palestinian Potters' Seals. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, Quarterly Statement, XXXVII, 1905, pp. 243-253 and 328-342, R. S. MACALLISTER discusses the stamps of pottery bearing the words, in old Hebrew letters, " To the King," and after these one of the four proper names, Hebron, Shocoh, Ziph, or Mem- shath. He suggests that these four names belong to guilds of royal potters, and appeals to 1 Chr. ii. 42; iv. 16, 18, 21, 23, in proof that HIebron and Ziph and Shocoh were the names of potters' guilds in the time of the Chronicler. Mareshah in these verses he regards as a textual corruption of Memshath, the fourth of the potters' guilds. The connection of these names with the daugh- ter of Pharaoh in iv. 18 he explains as due to the use of the Egyptian scarab as a symbol on these jar handles. Besides the so-called royal stamps there are a number of stamps with the names of private persons. These can be arranged in more or less complete genealogies, and they correspond more or less perfectly with the lists of potters' families in Chronicles. The Ossuary of Nicanor.--In Pal. Ex. Fund, Quarterly Statement, XXXVII, 1905, pp. 253-257, R. A. S. MACALLISTER discusses the genuine- ness of the Nicanor ossuary in reply to the strictures of Belleli. He shows that the ossuary was discovered by the dragoman of Sir John Gray Hill on Sir John's grounds, and that it was seen in situ by a number of residents of Jerusalem; that there was no motive for forgery, and that no forger in Jeru- salem is sufficiently clever to execute such an ossuary. A forger would surely have mentioned that Nicanor was the builder of the gate of the Temple, but a contemporary would not consider this necessary. The bad Greek of the inscription is no evidence against its genuineness, since equally bad Greek is found in numerous other Jewish inscriptions of the same period. The God Esmun. -In Zeitschr. d. Mlorgenldndischen Gesellsch. LIX, 1905, pp. 459-522, W. BAUDISSIN discusses the Phoenician god Esmun, in whom new interest has been aroused since the discovery of his temple at Sidon.</page><page sequence="9">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCIIAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 185 Through his identification with Aesculapius his cult exercised a wide influ- ence in the Graeco-Roman world, and through absorption of Canaanitish ideas by the Israelites, it was not without influence upon the formation of Hebrew religious ideas. The name is connected with the Hebrew root shaman, "to be fat" in the sense of "vigorous," so that Esmun means "the strong" or "imighty." The monuments show that the cult of Esmun prevailed from Mesopotamia as far as the Phoenician colonies in Northern Africa. The identification with Aesculapius is first attested by a trilingual inscrip- tion of the second century from Sardinia. All of the passages in classical writers in which this identification is made are here cited, and the inference is drawn that Esmun was a god of healing with attributes similar to those of Aesculapius. On coins Esmun seems to be identified with Dionysus, which points to agricultural elements in his character similar to those of the Baalim of Canaan. Finally, the identification of Esmun with Astarte in the combined name Esmun-Astart is discussed, and the combination with Melkart in the combined name Esmun-Melkart. The Mesha Inscription. - In Zeitschr. d. Morgenldndischen Gesellsch. 1905, pp. 33-35, F. PRAETORIUS discusses several difficult passages in the Mesha inscription. The one usually translated, " And Omri took the whole land of Medebah, and dwelt in it his days and half of his son's days, 40 years," Praetorius renders, " A garrison was placed in it during his days and half the days of his son, 40 years." The difficult passage about Ariel he translates, "I carried away prisoner from them Ariel, their governor, and dragged him before Chemosh." Ibid. p. 250, K6NIG points out difficulties in the way of Praetorius's rendering of this latter passage. Ibid. pp. 233-251, E. K6NIG maintains that the Mesha inscription is genuine. The objection that it is ascribed to the one king of Moab mentioned in the Old Testa- ment, is answered by showing that the Old Testament mentions also Balak and Eglon. Points separating the words are found in the Siloam inscrip- tion and in the Zenjirli inscriptions. Lines between clauses are found also in an inscription of Ashurnatsirpal and in Babylonian hymns. The indi- cation of certain vowels by vowel letters occurs as early as the Zenjirli in- scriptions. Differences from pure Hebrew constitute no objection to the genuineness of the monument, since it is not likely that the Moabites spoke exactly the same idiom as the Israelites; the differences that occur are those that we should expect in the direction of closer resemblance to the Aramaic and Arabic. There is accordingly no sufficient reason for doubting its genuineness. A New Attempt to translate Hittite Inscriptions. - In S. Bibl. A rch. XXVII, 1905, pp. 191-254 (pl.), A. Ii. SAYCE maintains that the time has now arrived when the decipherment of the Hittite inscriptions is complete. He gives a translation of most of the texts published in Messrs. Schmidt, Corpus Inscriptionum Hettiticarum, accompanied with notes on certain einen- dations of the text and an elaborate commentary. At the end is an alpha- betic vocabulary of all the words in the inscriptions as they are identified by the author, and a table of characters that have not been included in previous lists of signs. In The Biblical World, XXVI, 1905, pp. 31-40, the same author gives a sketch of the way in which the Hittites have become known to us and of the various steps in the process of deciphering their writing.</page><page sequence="10">186 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 Palmyrene Inscriptions in New York. - In J. Am. Or. S. XXVI, pp. 105-112 (8 pls.), W. R. ARNOLD discusses eight Palmyrene monuments in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. These are of the familiar Palmy- rene type, bearing busts (in one case a full-length figure) of deceased persons and brief inscriptions giving the names, descent, and date of death. Palmyrene Tesserae.- In J. Am. Or. S. XXVI, pp. 114-116 (pl.), H. H. SPOER describes seven small Palmyrene tesserae bearing figures and brief inscriptions. Prehistoric Flints in Syria. - In Bib". World, XXVI, 1905, p. 68, J. H. BREASTED gives a summary of an address by MAX BLANCKENIORN on the flint implements of Syria. Flints of all periods are found in large num- bers in Syria and have never been studied with any degree of thoroughness. Blanckenhorn makes a provisional classification of them and suggests the periods to which different types presumably belong. The High Place at Petra. - In 2liitth. d. Pal. V. 1905, pp. 49-56, H. GUTHE discusses the high place at Petra. He holds that its age cannot be certainly determined, but that in any case it gives an exact idea of the sort of high places that were in use among the Canaanites, and that were adopted from them by the Israelites in their conquest of the land. The Heracleum of Rabbat-Ammon (Philadelphia) and the Goddess Asteria. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 209-215, CLERMONT-GANNEAU, on the basis of an inscription (R. Bibl. 1905, pp. 596 f.) and coins of (Rabbat- Ammon) Philadelphia, in Coele Syria, associates Heracles at that place with Milkom. A coin of L. Verus mentions the goddess Asteria, who may be identified with Astarte. Athenaeus IX, 322, calls Heracles the son of Asteria, and says that he was killed by Typhon in Libya, but resuscitated by the odor of a quail. By another story Asteria was changed into a quail, then into an island, Asteria or Ortygia (Delos). Syrian Bronzes.- In Mon. Me'm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 65-78 (pls. VI, VII; 4 figs.), A. DE RIDDER publishes three bronzes in the Clercq collection in the Louvre. (Catalogue de Clercq III, Les Bronzes, 218-219, pp. 141-146 and 328, pp. 233-235.) All are from Tortosa. The first is a lararium consisting of a Tyche between a trophy and a Nike. Before these three figures are two Erotes, each holding a torch. The Erotes stand on ships' prows supported on short columns. The trophy is supported on a tree trunk, the Nike on a column. Although part of the base is modern, the group as a whole is ancient. The original probably belonged to the Hellenistic age. The other two bronzes are statuettes of the Zeus of IHeliopolis, with which two bronze bulls were probably found. One of the statuettes is adorned with a series of busts in high relief, the other merely with disks. Such differences are probably due to the fact that the original object of cult was merely a betyl which was partially anthropo- morphized at a comparatively late date, the time of the Antonines or later. The Month Abib Identical with the Egyptian Epiphi. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXVII, 1905, pp. 255-259 E. MAHLER gives evidence of the existence among the Egyptians of what he calls a "nature year " in distinction from the ordinary " vague year " and the " Sothic year." On New Year's Day of this year first-fruits were brought to the temple of Slut. This was 50 days from the 15th of Epiphi. This interval of 50 days corresponds with the interval of 50 days between the 15th of Abib on which the Passover was</page><page sequence="11">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 187 kept and the feast of Pentecost on which the first-fruits were offered. Hence it is inferred that Abib is identical with Epiphi of an Egyptian nature year. ASIA MINOR Lycaonian and Phrygian Notes. - In Cl. R. XIX, 1905, pp. 367-370, W. M. RAMSAY publishes an inscription at Zizma (Zizima), on four sides of a stone with reliefs: on side A, flOVXh~Evs ['I]a[T]ppOKX[] V [M]0Evqik x ov 'Oporov dX~v x 'A7r6XhhXwv t (oovrt, on side B, 'Avy&amp;t. r[rq] K6OJ, oil side C, 'H[X[]ov, on side D, M-qrpN Zt/_tL/xv. As the Meter Zizimene was an Iconian deity, latrokles was probably a senator of Iconium. Another in- scription, [aci r]OKparTOpov, indicates that the property of the Meter Zizimene at Zisma formed an Imperial estate. A third inscription is briefly described. An inscription, A'lXtos, :Efl(acrTo) T7roEX(Ev'oEpos), 4aLVgoro &amp;VE'oT7or-E, appar- ently refers to a freedman of Hadrian, in charge of the Imperial estate. Other indications of the Imperial property at Zizma are found at the neigh- boring Laodicea Katakekaumene, so called from the smoke of its quicksilver mines. A fragmentary dedication to Dionysus, with mention of the deme of Zeus Megistos Olympios, is published, as is also an inscription from a village of the Saittan territory (Ala-Agatch-Tchiftlik), recording that a priest of Asclepius introduced statues of Asclepius and Hygieia into the temple of Zeus Agoraios. Ibid. pp. 413-429, Takali is identified with Dakalias. Kaballa may be identical with these, or is to be placed at Tchigil. Colonia Iconiensiumn is discussed. An inscription proves that Iconium was not a colony until late in Hadrian's reign, when a new province was formed and, probably, the Koinon of the Lycaones was created. Iconium remained a part of Provincia Galatia (inscription). ' Zeus Eurydamenos' and 'The Imperial Estates Round Pisidian Antioch' are discussed on the basis of inscriptions. The 'Inscriptions of the Xenoi Tekmoreioi' are discussed. The 7EKoJp was a pledge of loyalty to the State in its contest with the Christians. The dates of these inscrip- tions are about 215-225 and 245-255 A.D. A list of names of towns and villages is added. The tendency to move from the city to the country in the third century after Christ is due to the revival of the Oriental spirit and to the greater attractiveness of life on the Imperial estates. Aranda. - In R. E?t. Gr. XVIII, 1905, pp. 159-164, TH. REINACH discusses the inscription from Aghatcha-Kald (see Am. J. Arch. 1905, p. 344). He reads: 'AOdva[mraj] pivLda rap EV'[0]Et'roL o-a8pap7rTo-Lv KELIeTQL 'Op(p)o[Lcv-L re &lt;'Aptov'Kov &gt; KaL 'Aptou'K LwL UiwL, ovVEKE[v] 'Apcv , 0, "v KrtL(o[E], XEpcrata Xa/3ov, GrEyoVS TE KaXo[ o7rotLK] a LXCrdXm. "Immortal reminders (or memories) will remain with (i.e. in the minds of) just satraps of Oromanes, son of Arioukes, and his dear son Arioukes, on account of Aranda, which he (i.e. Oromanes) founded, having received a sterile land, and also the many-colored walls of a fair palace." The town of Aranda is otherwise unknown. Enaia or Anaia in Caria. - In J. Int. Arch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 161- 174 (pl.), I. N. SvoRONos discusses some coins with the inscription E N</page><page sequence="12">188 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 (sometimes as a monogram) and various types, e.g. a cow with a calf, a pelta, a rosette, a head of Heracles. The dates range from before the Persian wars to the second century B.C. These coins are ascribed to Enaia, usually written Anaia, a town on the coast of Caria. Paphlagonian Rock-Tombs. - A brief account of the pre-Persian rock- graves of Paphlagonia, copied from the half-buried dwellings of the eastern part of Asia Minor, and yet showing in the later examples resemblance to Cyprian and Ionic buildings, is given by R. LEONHARD in Arch. Anz. 1905, pp. 149-150, together with some discussion of other rock-cuttings of that region. They all belong within the sphere of the " Mycenaean " civilization, and are the work of a pre-Phrygian people, worshippers of Cybele, the earth- quake goddess, whose name means "cavern." Lydian and Carian Inscriptions in Egypt. - In S. Bibl. A rch. XXVII, 1905, pp. 123-128 (3 pls.), A. H. SAYCE discusses nine Lydian and Carian inscriptions that have been found in various parts of Egypt during the last few years and gives a provisional translation of them. Some new charac- ters appear in these that have not been noted previously in inscriptions in the dialects of Asia Minor. On p. 129 G. LEGRAIN adds three inscriptions from Gebel Abou Gorab. Occurrences of the Name Mausolus in Egypt and Assyria.- In Orient. Lit. Zeit. VIII, 1905, cols. 5-11, W. M. MUCLLER maintains that Mau- tenra of the Egyptian texts and Mutallu of the Assyrian texts are both variations of the Carian royal name Mausolus. GREECE ARCHITECTURE The Two Labyrinths. - In J. H. S. XXV, 1905, pp. 320-337 (pl.; 3 figs.), H. R. HALL, author of The Oldest Civilization of Greece (1901), shows that there must have been a striking resemblance in appearance between the Labyrinth proper or House of the Double-axe at Cnossus and the funerary temple of Ameneinhat III of the Twelfth Dynasty in Egypt (about 2200 B. c.) to which the Greeks gave the same name. The story of Daedalus having visited Egypt and imitated the " labyrinth" has therefore some foundation. The common origin not only of the civilization but of the inhabitants of Minoan Crete and Greece with those of Egypt, and the non-Aryan character of the very language of Greece before the twelfth century B. C., are constantly receiving new proof. Cretan, Mycenaean, and Homeric Palaces. - In Athen. Mitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 257-296 (pl.; 5 figs.), W. D6RPFELD calls attention to the fact that the great palaces of Cnossus and Phaestus, in their earlier forms, were built about open courts, whereas the palaces of Tiryns and Mycenae, and also the later palaces of Cnossus and Phaestus, had a great hall (megaron) as their distinguishing feature. These palaces are identical with those described in the Homeric poems, and are Achaean. The earlier Cretan palaces were not Achaean, but Caro-Lycian. The Caro-Lycian inhabitants of Crete were conquered or driven away by Minos, but they had given to the Achaeans many elements of their culture. The name " Carian " or " Cretan" is proposed, as preferable to "Minoan " for the culture of the pre-Achaean inhabitants of Crete.</page><page sequence="13">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCIIAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 189 Treasuries at Olympia and Elsewhere. - Ten of the twelve founda- tions along the north terrace at Olympia have been assigned on good evidence to their owners; one is unknown, and one is not a treasury but an altar, possibly that of Ge. These little buildings, only two of which belong to cities of Greece proper, date from shortly before 600 to shortly after 480 B.C., the period of colonial greatness, and were built with the double motive of honoring the god and the city. They are not properly treasuries, places for the safe-keeping of valuables, but rather communal houses, partaking of the nature of temples, though without cult-statues, and used for storing the articles needed by the delegates in their religious rites. At Delos, such houses are called simply ot'Kot, and at Olympia often vaoL or vaoTKot, Oro-avp O being more used at Delphi, where such houses had in some instances once been real treasuries, founded by an individual and afterwards appropriated by the community. The evidence is strong that at Delphi the house below those of the Athenians and the Thebans belonged to the Ionic Siphnians, and that the so-called Lesche of the Cnidians was identical with their treas- ury or communal house. The attempt to avoid this conclusion has led to juggling with the text of the passage from Lycurgus which mentions the building, and enriching the reputation of Polygnotus with work in the Theseumr and the Temple of Apollo at Delphi which really belongs to Micon and Aristoclides. (L. DYER, J. H. S. XXV, 1905, pp. 294-319; fig.) The Restoration of the Parthenon. - The question of the restoration of ruinous building in general, and of the Parthenon in particular, is dis- cussed in R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 327-334, by IH. A. VASNIER (reprinted from L'Helle'nisme, June 1, 1905), who argues in its favor. SCULPTURE The Pediment Sculptures of the Old Hecatompedon. --In Sitzb. Miin. Akad. 1905, iii, pp. 433 ff., A. FUIRTW-_ANGLERI declares that the so- called Typhon and the group of Heracles and Triton cannot belong together. The western pediment was occupied by the group of Heracles and Triton and the great water snake, which indicated the transformations of the Old Man of the Sea. The eastern pediment contained in the middle Athena sitting between the seated Zeus, who held ant eagle, and the standing Hermes; in one corner was the serpent that typified Erichthonius, in the other the three figures with serpent body and wings, which are not one person, but are explained as the Tripatores, fructifying wind-spirits of Attic popular belief. The later marble group of the gigantomiachy is also discussed, and its figures differently arranged. Athena's left hand holds a snake of her own aegis, not the crest of the giant. The Offering of the Arcadian Phauleas to Pan.--In A then. Mitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 65-72 (pl.; fig.), F. STUDNICZKA publishes a bronze statu- ette (10 cm. in height), with the inscription ?DavxE'a; vl'Ovo- I r 7 ^ avt'. Its place of origin is Arcadia, probably the sanctuary of Pan near the sources of the Neda. A bearded male figure is represented, clad in a single heavy garment (xXaatva) and wearing a pointed hat (trwtoy). The attributes once held in the hands are lost. The style is rude, but full of life. It is a local Peloponnesian style, which follows directly upon the "geometrical " tradi- tion, and remains more or less free from " Ionic " influence. It is therefore</page><page sequence="14">190 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 a natural starting-point for the development of the freer art of the fifth century. A Statue of a Youth at Madrid. -In R. Arch. VT, 1905, pp. 103-106 (2 figs.), A. MAHLER compares the Ephebus at Madrid (ibid. 1901, ii, pls. xix, xx; Clarac-Reinach, I, 344, 6) with the Hestia Giustiniani, and finds that both, as well as the Triptolemus of the Eleusinian relief, may be ascribed to Calamis. The Fainting Wounded Man by Cresilas. - The Chron. d. Arts of July 1st, 1905, publishes on p. 195 a letter from A. FURTWXKNGLER, uphold- ing the authenticity of the statue said to be a Roman copy of Cresilas's " Fainting Wounded Man." (See Am. J. Arch. 1905, p. 469.) The Sarcophagi from Sidon. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 31-54 (2 pls.; 7 figs.), F. STUDNICZKA shows that the costumes and customs represented on the Greek sarcophagi from Sidon prove that they were made for Asiatic, probably Phoenician, customers. He argues that they were originally in- tended for those who were actually buried in themn at Sidon. The Relief of Lakrateides.-In Athen. JMitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 183- 198 (supplementary pl.; 2 figs.), D. PHILIOS discusses the relief at Eleusis dedicated by Lakrateides (Heberdey, Festschrfit.fiir Otto Benndof, 1898, pp. 111 ff.; Svoronos, J. Int. Arch. Num. 1901, pp. 487 ff.). He concludes that in the middle of the relief are represented the deities Demeter, Cora, Pluto- Elbouleus, Triptolemus, EOds', and Oed, at the right Lakrateides and his son Sostratus, at the left Dionysia and her son Dionysius. Echelos and Basile.-In the sixty-fifth "Winckelmannsprogramm " of the Berlin Arch. Gesellsch. a fine Attic relief in the Berlin Museum is published and explained, by comparison with the relief found by the road between Athens and the Piraeus in 1893 (Athen. 3Mitth. XVIII, 1893, pp. 212 f., 'ET. 'ApX. 1893, pp. 129-146, pls. 9, 10), as a representa- tion of Echelos and Basile. The two heroic personages are represented standing in a chariot moving rapidly to the left. Echelos is evidently car- rying Basile off. Before the horses stands a bearded man. Originally Echelos was connected with the lower world. The horses, the style, and the execution fix the date of the relief in the latter part of the fifth cen- tury B.C. Perhaps in Rhodes, where the relief was found, some other names were given to the persons represented, but the Attic artist doubtless called them Echelos and Basile. In an appendix an inscription, of about the beginning of the first century B.C. which was found at the same place as the relief, is published. It is a dedication to the heroine Brygindis, doubtless the eponym of the deme Brygindara, which was then probably situated where the inscription was found, on the site of the modern 'AaJvrov.

A Marble Lecythus of Attic Style. - In AMon. lMein. A cad. Insc. (Fon- dation Piot), XII, pp. 177-179 (pl.; 2 figs.), E. MICHON publishes a marble lecythus recently acquired by the Louvre. Neck, handle, and foot are want- ing. Below the figures, a braid pattern runs round the lecythus, and its upper and lower parts are fluted. In the middle, a woman (KIAAAPON TTYOOAQPOY AFPYAHOEN) is sinking into a chair. She is sup-</page><page sequence="15">GREEK VASES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 191 ported by an attendant from behind (right), and a third female figure, at the left, holds her up by the right arm and shoulder. A suggestion of Wolters that this scene indicates that the woman on whose tomb it occurs died in childbirth, meets with qualified approval. This lecythus dates from the beginning of the fourth century B.C. The other marble lecythi in the Louvre and their histories are discussed. The Apoxyomenus of Lysippus. --The attribution of the Apoxyo- menus to Lysippus rests on very insufficient grounds, which should have no weight compared with evidence to the effect that the marble statue of the athlete Agias discovered at Delphi is a contemporary copy of the bronze original by Lysippus. The two are entirely unlike in execution, the Agias belonging before, and the Apoxyomenus after, the beginning of the ana- tomical study of muscles at Alexandria about 300 n.c. This mistaken attribution has confused the whole question of the date and style of Lysip- pus, which should receive new study. He was a contemporary of Scopas and Praxiteles, especially resembling the former, and he represents not the Athenian decay, but the Peloponnesian revival of the fourth century. He was born early in the century, and had a long career, about 372-320, and some one of his pupils or later followers may very well have produced, in the third century, such a work as the Apoxyomelnus. (P. GARDNER, J. IH. S. XXV, ii, 1905, pp. 234-259; 9 figs. See ibid. XXIII, pp. 126 ff.) An Artemis in Rome; Lysippus and the Statues found at Delphi. - The torso of an Artemis statuette in the Vatican (Museo Chiaramonti) is discussed by W. AMELUNG in Rrmn. Mitth. XX, 1905; pp. 136-155; 8 figs. By the help of a similar statue at Mariemnont in Belgium -an Artemis with uplifted head-he argues for the influence of Lysippus, drawing fur- ther parallels from an Albani relief and from the Thessalian group at Del- phi, with a full discussion of Lysippus's claims in the latter case. Conjectural Interpretations. - In Jb. Arch. I. XX, 1905, pp. 108-112 (fig.), M. GOEBEL criticises the interpretation of the Praying Boy in Berlin as a ball-player, and that of the Capitoline Amazon as preparing for a pole- vault, and from the point of view of a gymnast decides against both. Greek Grave Reliefs of Asia Minor. - The various forms of funeral monument seen in the field of Greek grave reliefs of the Hellenistic and Roman periods in Asia Minor- stele, pillar, herm, round pedestal, altar, offering-table, tree--with the sirens, urns, busts, and other objects sup- ported by them, are discussed by E. PFUHL in Jb. Arch. I. XX, 1905, pp. 47-96 (3 pls.; 19 figs.) and connected with old Asiatic usage and Athenian religious ideas. A second article, ibid. pp. 123-155 (28 figs.), deals with the curtains and walls of various kinds which are shown in the background, espe- cially of funeral-feast scenes, and which represent the pavilions or temporary shelters used for commemorative banquets at the actual grave. A discussion follows of the relation of these grave reliefs to Attic prototypes of the fifth century and to later votive and decorative reliefs, and that of heroa and other graveyard structures to the temples of the gods. VASES AND PAINTING Timonidas. -In Athen. Mitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 199-206 (pl.; fig.), G. WEICKER publishes, more correctly than has been done heretofore, the</page><page sequence="16">192 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 Troilus-vase in Athens (Collignon and Couve, Catal. No. 620) signed by Timonidas. He discusses the technique, and publishes for the first time a vase, or bottle, of the same shape in the museum at Bonn. The decoration of this is more like the usual decoration of Corinthian vases, but has also special points of resemblance to that of the signed vase. It is thlerefore regarded as an early work of Timonidas, whose perfected style appears on the pinax in Berlin. Greek Vases in Sicily. - A contribution to the discussion of the influ- ence of wall-painting and of pre-Phidian sculpture on vase painters and of the growing political importance of the legend of Theseus in Athens in the fifth century, is made by G. E. RIzzo in Mon. Anticli, XIV, 1905, cols. 5-106 (5 pls.; 24 figs.), in publishing a crater of the "Polygno- tan " style from Camerina. In the middle of the.century this class of vases rather suddenly succeeded the severe red-figured cylixes, and although anony- mous, the examples can be grouped to somle extent chronologically and by workshops. This crater gives the abandonment of Ariadne by Theseus, the third scene in the story of which the first, the visit of Theseus to the bottom of the sea, is on the crater at Bologna. (J. H. S. XVIII, p. 278, fig. 7 ; Arch. Anz. 1889, p. 141.) The appearance of Marsyas as a cither player is to be noted. A second less important crater, also from Camerina, has the familiar departure-for-war scene modified to suit, apparently, the command of Am- phiaraus for vengeance against Eriphyle. An oenochoe fronm Randazzo, at the western edge of Greek colonization in the interior of Sicily, has a pic- ture of the Boreadae driving the Harpies away from Phineus, in which a group familiar in Amazon friezes and other battle scenes is adapted with great ,eauty. The Boreadae are armed not with sword or lance, but only with cords to bind the foe. The Harpies are beautiful winged maidens. There is an attempt at an effect of perspective in placing the figures from left to right higher on the surface. Unpublished Vases in the Museo Kircheriano. - In this small and somewhat neglected collection are some noteworthy examples. A Rhodian flat dish with zones of animals both inside and outside is especially well de- signed. Two perfume vases of the eighth or early seventh century .c. were perhaps also made in Rhodes. One is in the form of a helmeted head, of a class of which some two dozen are known, very widely distributed, the other in the form of a bovine head with human face, a type belonging to Asiatic Greece, and not unlike the oldest conception of Achelous. A large black- figured amphora with Heracles playing the cither among the gods and with an abbreviated form of the return of the Dioscuri, has some resemblance to the work of Exekias. Pieces of a large vase show a frieze of Silenus-like centaurs of the archaic type on the Assos frieze, with entire humnan figure prefixed to an equine body. This is the comic Dorian story of the rout of drunken centaurs by Heracles rather than the Thessalian fight. The ware most closely resembles the sarcophagi from Clazomenae, and is Ionic or Rhodian of the latter half of the sixth century. All these early vases have painted and incised decoration. A black-figured cylix is possibly from the workshop of Tleson. A fragment of a large vessel of severe red-figured style has a kottabos-scene from a banquet. Two red-figured cylixes of fine style have, one palaestra scenes and the other scenes in the gyneceum, including a rare Diadumene. A red-figured crater of fine style has two</page><page sequence="17">GREEK VASES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 193 winged female figures, one carrying a torch, who is perhaps an Artemis ,Ekavala or qwo-o6pog. These last three are to be dated not far from 400 B.C. (R. PARIBENI, iMon. Antichi XIV, cols. 269-308; 14 figs.; 1 colored pl.) Two Attic Lecythi and the History of Greek Painting.- In Mon. _l4dm. Acad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 29-54 (pls. iii-iv, v; 5 figs.), M. COLLIGNON publishes two lecythi with polychrome painting on a white ground. The first, in the Louvre, is 0.96 m. high, and resembles closely the even larger vase at Stift Neuburg, near Heidelberg (Zahn, Arch. Anz. 1893, p. 189). Before a stele seen in perspective from two points of view, sit two women, back to back. At the right, two women bring offerings, at the left one holds a taenia. The second vase, in Madrid, is 0.95 m. high. Before a stele, on which is an acanthus, sits the deceased, a young man. At each side stands a youth, and at the left are remains of a fourth figure. This vase is almost a replica of one in Berlin (Catal. No. 2685), and is by the same painter as that and one on which the prothesis is represented (ibid. No. 2684). These paintings, especially the one in Madrid, reproduce shadows chiefly by means of hatchings. The vase in the Louvre (as that at Stift Neuburg) shows the influence of Apollodorus and dates from the early years of the Peloponnesian War. The vase in Madrid (as those in Berlin) is a later work and may fairly be brought into connection with Zeuxis. These large lecythi were imitations of marble lecythi, and were set up as monuments in aedicula. A White Lecythus from Eretria. - In 'Eq. 'ApX. 1905 (pp. 37-54 ; pl. (colored) 1; fig. 1), ROBERT C. MCMIAHON publishes a white lecythus of the National Museum at Athens, found at Eretria. It bears the inscription 'AXKt'/LaXo KaX6O, and, as one of the earliest specimens of the polychrome class of lecythi, seems to date from the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. Style and technique, especially representations of figures en face, are minutely studied. Other vases bearing the same name appear to have been painted in the same workshop by different artists, while one which was apparently painted by the same artist bears a different name. Cocks on Gravestones. - In Athen. Mitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 207-212 (4 figs.), G. WEICKER publishes a white lecythus from Eretria, now in Athens (Collignon and Couve, Catal. No. 1002). In the middle of the painting is a stele, on which is a large cock. At each side stands a man, then at the left is a column and at the right a sitting dog. He publishes also the painting on a small red-figured aryballus (Collignon and Couve, Catal. No. 1522), which represents a cock standing beside a stele. The cock is ex- plained as a symbolic representation of the soul of the deceased, though not all cocks on stelae have this meaning; for the significance of the cock, as that of the siren and the sphinx, was sometimes forgotten. Porters on a Greek Vase. - In R. E1t. Anc. VII, 1905, pp. 325-327 (pl.), P. GRAINDOR publishes a cantharus from Oreos in Boeotia now in a pri- vate collection at Athens. On each side a man is represented, who carries two large baskets on a pole over his shoulders. In one of the baskets are plates and dishes. The name of the pole was foKEvoopEiLOV or avdaopov.

Six a discussion of Pausias, the pupil of Pamphilus, as the first painter of such small panels, - possibly of these very ones and of those in the ceiling of the tholos at Epidaurus, - and as a pornographus. His masterpiece - the black bull-- was probably painted in his earlier years, about 377-365 B.C. With his name, more correctly 'Pausanias,' Zeuxis for 'Zeuxippus' may be conm- pared. - (Jb. Arch. I.

X, 15. 6), is substantiated by Washburn's discovery. Inscriptions of Attica. - To Part I of the Introduction to Greek Epiq- raphy by E. S. Roberts, published in 1887, a second volume has appeared (An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy. Part II. The Inscriptions of Attica. Edited by E. S. ROBERTS, IM.A., and E. A. GARDNER, M.A., Cambridge, 1905, The University Press, 21s.; New York, The Macmillan Co., xxiv, 601 pp. 8vo.). The preface contains the new and old abbreviations for refer- ence to the C.I.G. The introduction treats of the Attic alphabet and the post-Euclidean alphabet. The list of abbreviations and the errata follow. The body of the book contains 410 inscriptions with careful commentaries, and is divided into thirteen sections: I, Decrees of the Senate and People, 1-69; 11, Decrees and Letters of Foreign States and of the Amphictyonic Council, 70-73; III, DI)ecrees of Tribes, Demes, Cleruchs, Clans, Phratriae, Guilds, and Other Associations, 74-91; IV, Imperial Ordinances, Laws, Edicts, and Other Documents, 92-96; V, Finance, 97-131; VI, Administra- tion of Temples, Regulations for Ritual, etc., 132-143 : VII, Official Lists of Various Kinds, 144-172; VIII, Dedications, 173-245; IX, Inscriptions on the Seats of the Theatre of Dionysius, 246-307; X, Artists' Signatures, Inscrip- tions on Statue-bases, etc., 308-331; XI, Boundary Stones and Mortgage Stones, 332-358; XII, Sepulchral Monuments, 359-389; XIII, Miscellaneous, 390-410. Numerous " Remarks," which are careful essays on special sub- jects, are inserted at appropriate points. A List of Denies with Demotics (by F. O.

The long block on which the inscription is cut was perhaps not an architrave supported by columns, yet it seems to have been the topmost member of a building into which it was possible to enter, therefore not an altar. The plan was prob- ably that of a temiplum in antis, the portico of which was about 1 inm. deep. Lists of Victors from Athens. - In A then. Mlitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 213- 219, A.

Ibid. pp. 292-305, the C.I.G. is further discussed and the works of Le Bas, Waddington, Foucart, Texier, Fr. Thiersch, Ross, Franz, Pittakis, and Rhangabe are described. COINS The Beginnings of Coinage at Athens. -In J. Int. Arch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 7-52 (14 figs.), E. BABELON continues his discussion of early Athe- nian coinage. The type of the helmet head of Athena, with the owl in an incuse square on the reverse, was introduced by Pisistratus. Hippias issued false coins, but also restored the light Euboic standard which had been in use before Solon. His coins show the influence of Ionic art. Some small coins testify to the relations of Hippias with Lampsacus. The olive leaves were added to the helmet of Athena on coins after the battle of Marathon. An Early Corinthian Weight. - In J. Int. A rch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 5-6 (fig.), F. HULTSCH publishes a bronze weight, found in Attica, and now in the Numismatic Museum at Athens. On one side is a bull's head in full face and the inscription 7roEv7rraTov in Corinthian letters, on the other the inscription [K]optvOL'ov. The weight is 82.52 g., i.e. five times a (heavy) stater of 16.50 g. This weight is approximately 1 of the Babylonian gold mina. One-tenth of the weight of the bronze piece is to the Corinthian stater as 15 to 16. Ennodia. - On a drachina of Alexander of Pherae is a garlanded female head and an inscription which Lallet read 'EXXas, and Gardner "Evvo(t)os. In J. Int. Arch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 175-176, K. REGLING reads the inscrip- tion 'Evvo8ca and interprets the head as Artemis-Hecate. Analysis of Some Greek Coins. - In J. Int. Arch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 115-120, A. C. CHRISTOMANOS gives an analysis of some silver drachmas of Alexander III. of Macedon, three Athenian tetradrachmas, a counter- feit Athenian drachma, and some silver billon deniers of the dukes of Athens and the princes of Achaia. The genuine ancient coins mentioned all seem to be made of silver from Laurium. A Coin of Dodona. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 97-102 (2 figs.), T. REINACH publishes a bronze coin in the Waddington collection in the Cabinet de France (Obv. bust of Zeus to r.; Rev. thunderbolt). The inscription reads AIA (on Obv.) NA-ON (on Rev.). The coin is assigned by Reinach to the fourth century B.C. and to Dodona. The title Zeus Naos is discussed. Coins of Zankle-Messana.-In the Amer. Jour. of Numismatics, 1905, pp. 93-99 (1 pl.), FRANK SHERMAN BENSON continues his description and publication of ancient coins in his collection, with historical notes, treating here of nine silver coins of Zankle-Messana, from ca. 550 to ca. 396 B.C.</page><page sequence="22">198 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

(REGLING, Arch. Anz. 1905, p. 118.) The Admiral's Staff on Coins.- The staff or wand seen on Greek coins, which has been variously interpreted, is the Phoenician admiral's staff, used on coins of Aradus as early as the fifth century and adopted by Alex- ander for the Nike on his coins to express his conquest over the great sea- power that had troubled him and the Greeks, even in the Aegean. (ASSMANN, Arch. Anz. 1905, p. 119.) GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Enneakrounos.- In Athen. 3litth. XXX, 1905, pp. 1-64 (3 pls.; 32 figs.), F. GRiBER discusses in detail the system of waterworks near the Pnyx. His conclusions agree with those of D6rpfeld in all essentials. The source of the water for the Enneakrounos of Pisistratus was the upper part of the valley of the Ilissus, in part, perhaps, the springs at Kaisariani, but probably for the most part the water which is found, on account of the geological stratifications, below the surface of the soil. The historical devel- opmient of the water-supply system of Athens is sketched. Eleusinian Studies. - In J. Int. Arch. Nunm. VIII, 1905, pp. 131-160, I. N. SvoRoNos maintains, against Philios (see Am. J. A rch. 1905, p. 477), that the Xrcco-Erjpov at Eleusis was not the temple of Demeter, but that the temple was on the site now occupied by the church, while Cora had a sepa- rate temple somewhat lower. Greek Wooden Sarcophagi. - The Greek wooden sarcophagi found at Abusir have been carefully discussed by CARL XVATZINGER (Griechische Holzsarkophal e aus der Zeit A lexanders des Grossen. Von Carl Watzinger, Wissenschaftliche Ver6ffentlichungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft, Heft 6. vii, 96 pp.; 1 colored plan; 3 colored pls.; 135 figs.; smnall folio. Leipzig, 1905, J. C. Hinrichs'sche Buchh.; New York, Stechert, 35 Mk). In connection with these, other wooden sarcophagi, chiefly from the Crimea, are published and discussed. Sixty-one specimens are described, twenty of which are known to the writer only by description. Nine only are from Abusir. Greek pottery of the seventh, sixth, and fifth centuries B.C. was found in small quantities at Abusir, but most of the Greek remains belong to the fourth century, and Greek interments are limited to that period, perhaps beginning before 350, and ceasing before 300 B.C. The processes of embalm- ing and wrapping up the bodies, the mode of burial, and the accessories are described. The sarcophagi are divided into "Chest-sarcophagi" and "House-sarcophagi." In the first class the sides and ends are divided into horizontal panels; in the second, vertical divisions by means of columns and pilasters appear. The top of both classes has the formn of a saddle roof. The decorations are elaborately discussed and illustrated. They are in accordance with the known taste of the period. In an appendix Professor v. HANSEMAN and Professor SCHAUINSLAND add notes on the skeletons from the Greek graves at Abusir. The Dionysium in Limnis. - In Cl. I.

Aristotle's Aesthetics. --In the Publications of the George WVashington University, Philology and Literature Series, I, 1, November, 1905, pp. 1-10, MITCHELL CARROLL discusses Aristotle's Aesthetics of Painting and Sculp- ture as disclosed in the Poetics. He regarded these arts as forms of imita- tion and distinguishes three schools, - Idealism, Realism, and Caricature. Alexander's Funeral Car. - A reconstruction of Alexander's funeral car as an unusually splendid travelling coach, from Hieronym us's description quoted by Diodorus (XVIII, 26-28) is given by U. von TWILAMOWITZ- MOELLENDORFF in Jb. Arch. I. XX. 1905, pp. 103-108, in correction of K. Miiller's recent Leipzig dissertation on the subject. The late-Greek Kralipa, used for the body of the coach, is a Carian word. The Greek Warship Again. - In J.H.S. XXV, 1905, pp. 204-224, W. W. TARN continues his destructive criticism of the various restorations and explanations of the ancient war-vessel, his point being that the " banks" of oars, whatever they were, were not rows one above another. The bireme made its appearance late in the first century n.c., and is not prominent in literature. The prow of the Victory of Samothrace is almost certainly that of a hepteres, as Demetrius Poliorcetes is stated by Diodorus to have used a vessel of that type, his own invention, at the battle of Salamis (307 B..) which the monument commemorates. The Lenormant relief in Athens (cut) is to be considered a moneres, the extra bands across the hull being part of the hull itself. (See ibid. pp. 17 ff.; A m. J. Arch. IX. 1905, p. 478.) Triremes. - In Cl. IR.XIX, 1905, pp. 370-377 (12 figs.), A. B. COOK and W. RICHARDSON maintain that in the ancient trireme the thole-pins were all at the same height and the oars all extended the same distance from the vessel, but were of three lengths, so that the rowers were arranged in threes, the man at the longest oar sitting farther from the side, nearer the stern, and slightly higher than the man at the middle oar, who, in turn, was similarly placed in respect to the man at the shortest oar. Such was the arrangement in the Venetian galleys. CECIL TORR, ibid. p. 466, declares that this expla- nation is contrary to the existing evidence. The rowers were probably arranged in quincuncem, and the sides of the trireme were much more bulging than are those of modern vessels. Greek and Etruscan Mirrors. -In the Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin, III, 6, December, 1905, is a brief descriptionl of Greek and Etruscan bronze mirrors in general and a publication (3 figs.) of three of the specimens in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Wrestling. - In ,J. H. S. XXV, 1905, pp. 263-293 (pl.; 26 figs.), E. N. GARDINER continues his discussion of the representations of wrestling groups in ancient art and literature, following out the various forms of arm, neck, and body holds, tripping, and other complicated leg movements, with examples from the contests of Heracles and the Nemean lion, Theseus and Cercyon, Peleus and Atalanta, as well as plain athletes. IIe shows that many positions supposed to be taken from the pancratium, ground-wrestling, are rather positions leading to the decisive throw of real wrestling. So it is with Heracles and Antaeus, the story of a squeezing to death in the air being a late invention. The puzzling passage in the Knights, 261-263, is explained as a series of metaphors from wrestling. (See ibid. pp. 14 ff.)</page><page sequence="24">200 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 KXELTWVV-IIokX1KXELTOS.- In C1. R. XIX, 1905, pp. 323-325, W. L. 'WEST- ERMANN argues that KXc'rowv (Xen. M1em. iii, 10) is a shortened form for IlHoXPKXELTo0. Examples of similar forms are given, and the probability that Polyclitus was for some time in Athens is emphasized. Pre-Hellenic Rock Builders. - At the April (1905) meeting of the Berlin. Arch. Gesellsch., C. F. Lehmann spoke on rock-cuttings and Cyclopean rock-structures in Greece and western Asia, which he regards as the skilled work of a long-practised non-Indogermanic race, the Carians. These include the fortification of the ninth century B.C. and some rock-cut chambers and stairways on Lake Van, the round-arched royal rock-tombs of the seventh century near Harput, the Paphlagonian tomb-forts, mountain stairways, whether for watches or for the use of the gods, tunnels into the tops of mountains, perhaps for the earthquake goddess Cybele and her lions, the water-fort in Lake Copais and a similar one in the Euphrates, the stairs of the Areopagus, the Pnyx, the stairs leading to the spring of Castalia, and a recently discovered stairway above the spring. With these are connected the eastward and westward movements of Chaldaeans, Thracians, and others in Asia Minor. (Arch. Anz. 1905, pp. 112-116.) ITALY ARCHITECTURE The So-called Arches of Triumph. - In R. Arch. VT, 1905, pp. 216- 230, A. L. FROTHINGHAM, JR., shows that the arches in the various towns of the Roman Empire were communal, not triumphal, arches, and commem- orated the foundation of the colony or the granting of some privilege by the Roman state. Their dates can thus be determined by a knowledge of the local history or may throw light upon that history. Such arches usually stood at the outer edge of the pomoerium. The Jani in Rome originally marked the pomoeria of the villages which were afterward united. The tri- unmphal arch (porta triumphalis) at Rome was at the edge of the pomoerium, on the Via Flaminia, where an extension of the pomoerium would cause the erection of a new arch. At Constantinople were two such arches, the Porta Aurea of Theodosius and an earlier one of Constantine. SCULPTURE A Series of Statues of the Age of the Antonines.- In A then. 3Mitth. XXX, 1905, pp. 242-256 (8 figs.), E. HERKENRATH enumerates a series of draped female statues (including some reliefs) distinguished by the position of the girdle, which is not at the waist or higher, but passes loosely tound the hips. Among these figures are the ' Electra' of -the group of ' Orestes and Electra,' in Naples, and the Farnese Flora. This peculiar manner of wearing the girdle does not occur before the middle of the second century after Christ. The Farnese Flora was probably made by order of Caracalla for his new baths. Sculptures in the Palazzo Giustiniani. - In B. Com. Roma, XXXIII, 1905, pp. 3-61 (5 pls.; 16 figs.), G. E.

AMELUNG brings together a number of scat- tered reliefs in Rome representing a gigantomnachy. Scale, style, material, etc., show that these foriied a single decorative whole, adapted in the age of Hadrian from an original brought from Rhodes or Asia Minor. The site appears to have been in the Subura, not far from the Forum of Vespasian. Two Pompeian Bas-reliefs. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1905, pp. 464-471 (3 figs.), H. THI-DENAT discusses two reliefs from Poimpeii. The first rep- resents the northern side of the .forum, the second is explained as a repre- sentation of the water tower at the Vesuvian gate, and both are regarded as votive offerings set up after the earthquake of 63 A.D. A Glass Head.--A polychrome glass head, with alabaster bust, in the Conservatori Museum at Rome is described by W. AMELUNG in Rim. Mlitth. XX, 1905, pp. 131-135 (2 colored pls.; 1 fig.), and connected by him with a fragment of a similar head in Strassburg. Besides two colors of glass (black for the hair), the artist had also applied a yellowish tint to the face, and added eyes of metal. The rarity of similar objects in glass gives un- usual interest to this well-preserved specimen, perhaps of the Augustan age. PAINTING Micon and Pero. - The Pompeian epigram on Micon and Pero (the original of the "pietas Roinana " story) is again discoursed by A. MAU in Rbmn. Mlitth. XX, 1905, pp. 188-192, with a new restoration of the inscription. INSCRIPTIONS An Uprising in Germany. - From the cemetery of Commodilla on the Ostian Way comes (1904) a fragmentary inscription of about 200 A.D., relating to some uprising in Roman Germany, with the assistance of a bar- barian fleet. A. VON DOMASZEWSKI, who discusses these fragments in Rimin. Mitth. XX, 1905, pp. 156-163, conjectures that they belong to an elogium of Didius Julianus. Epigraphic Bulletin. --In R. Arch.

BESNIER in their review of epigraphical publications relating to Roman antiquity for the period March-June, 1905, give the text of eighty- one inscriptions and notes on publications relating to epigraphy. Leaden Tablets with Devotiones. - Two leaden tablets from the tombs of the Appian Way are brought to notice by K. LOIHMEYER in R1nm. Mlitth. XX, 1905, pp. 164-165 (1 fig.). Both were used in derotiones. One shows traces of writing deliberately erased; the other is illegible. COINS Silver-plated Coinage of the Roman Empire. - GIOVANNI DATTARI has essayed to explain the issue by the mints of the later Roman Empire of quantities of silver-plated coins by the theory that the activity of forgers was thus defeated, since they could not issue coins of such fabric. His further belief is that when such coins lost by weair their wash of silver, and could no longer be distinguished from counterfeit issues, they were retired from circulation. SERAFINO RICCI, in Bollettino di Numismatica, 1905, pp. 65-68, points out certain difficulties in the way of the acceptance of this</page><page sequence="26">202 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 theory, and the need of more complete investigation by periods of extant specimens before an ultimate decision can be reached. Representations of Carthage.--In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1905, pp. 97-99 (fig.), A. BLANCHET discusses coins of the fourth century after Christ on which Carthage is represented as a draped female, similar to the figure in a Carthaginian mosaic of. the fifth century. Bronze Medal of Constantine. - In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1905, pp. 160-164, J. MAURICE discusses a bronze medal of Constantine in the Cabinet de France. (Obv. bust of Constantine to r., with diadem and paludamentum. CONSTANTINVS MAX. AVG. Rev. Constantine seated to 1., the lower part of body draped.

The resurrection of the emperor in the persons of his sons and the triumph over paganism are symbolized by the phoenix and the panther. (Cf. ibid. p. 171.) GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Flint Daggers found in Italy. - In B. Paletn. It. XXXI, 1905, pp. 85- 95 (1 fig.), G. PATRONI discusses the types of flint daggers found in Italy, and proposes a terminology for the same, ' propos of specimens preserved at Pavia. Prehistoric Weapons and Tomb. - In B. Paletn. It. XXXI, 1905, pp. 1-13 (1 p1.; 1 fig.), G. A. COLINI discusses flint weapons in the Museo Preistorico at Rome; also an aeneolithic tomb in the region of Benevento. The Flint Objects from Breonio Veronese. - In B. Paletn. It. XXXI, 1905, pp. 134-138, L. PrIGOINsr discusses the question of the genuineness of flint objects purporting to be from Breonio Veronese. The Bronze Age in Sicily. - In B. Paletn. It. XXXI, 1905, pp. 18-70 (2 pls.; 66 figs.), G. A. COLINI continues his work on the civilization of the bronze age in Italy. This portion relates to Sicily. The Phoenician Colony of Nora in Sardinia. - A study of the pre- IHellenic remains on the site of Nora in Sardinia, published by G. PATRONI, in JMon. Antichi, XIV, 1905, cols. 109-258 (20 pls.; 58 figs.; index), shows that the primitive civilization of the nuraghi, which flourished with wide maritime relations in the second millennium n.c., was in decay before the arrival of the Phoenicians, that the colonization of Nora by the latter people was parallel with and independent of that of Carthage, and that the later commercial relations of the colony were chiefly with Campania and never directly with Greece. To the early Phoenician period, with strong Oriental and Egyptian influences, belong the remains of the chief temple, apparently a mere colonnade surrounding the altar on which the idol stood. One capital, with volutes and with Cypriote characteristics, survives, and also the idol itself, a triangular pyramidal stone. Other buildings are probably a watch tower and a smelting furnace for zinc. Some rock-cut pit graves of the seventh century or earlier contain, owing to frequent re-use for new burials, chiefly furnishings of the sixth and fifth centuries, and partly con- temporary with these is a cemetery of incinerated burials in urns in the sand, with sculptured stelae. Largely through these stelae, the Phoenician religion, at least in relation to the dead, is seen to belong to the primitive</page><page sequence="27">FRANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 203 Aegeo-Asiatic worship of a nature-goddess, the Great Mother, with progres- sive anthropomorphism in the outward representation. The worship of Baal, coming in with a patriarchal system, is less prominent than at Car- thage. In the rock graves are found feather-shaped objects of gold or silver, bound to the foreheads of the dead, which point to Iberian connections and to the existence of a Phoenician element in Spain before the coming of the Carthaginians. A bronze fibula, very rare in Sardinia, resembles one found at Camirus. The archaic Phoenician glass is very fine. Attic vases of the fifth century are found in a single grave only. Terracottas include those of primitive local type as well as early and late Phoenician, under Egyptian and Graeco-Punic influence respectively. FRANCE The Ancient Settlements at Toulouse. -In C. R. A cad. Insc., 1905, pp. 285-293, L. JOULIN passes in review the archaeological investigations in and near Toulouse. The ruins and other remains extend from the first iron age to the end of the Roman rule. Art in Gaul. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 306-313 (fig.), S. REINACH publishes a lecture delivered at the Petit Palais during the exposition of 1900. He calls attention to the existence of schools of art in Gaul in pre- historic times and in Roman times. That which was Graeco-Roman in Gallic art disappeared with the fall of the Roman Empire, but that which was native endured and led to mediaeval art. Artemis with Serpents. - One side of the altar of Savigny (Cote-d'Or) offers the figure of Diana holding a torch in one hand and two serpents in the other. S. REINACIH observes that this corresponds to Pausanias's de- scription of Artemis at Lycosura. Several figures on the altar of Savigny are copies of archaic statues in Rome. There was probably in Rome an archaic Arcadian Diana holding serpents. The Arcadian origin of King Evander and the identity of the Lupercalia at Rome with the Arcadian Lykeia are called to mind. The worship of a serpent-goddess may have passed from Crete to Arcadia, thence to Rome, and finally to Gaul. (C. R. Acad. Insc. 1905, p. 308.) Epona.- A wooden fragmentary statuette of Epona, seated on a horse, with a dog on her knees and a child beside her, is published by CH. DANGI- BEAUD, in R. Et. Anc. VII, 1905, pp. 234-238 (pl.; 2 figs.). It is in the museum of Saintes and was found some years ago not far from the ancient baths, north of the city. It testifies to the cult of Epona in this region. The Relief from Cornillon.--In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1905, pp. 108 f., E. ESPERANDIEU suggests that the relief from Carnillon (Am. J. Arch. 1905, p. 360) may represent the rape of Thalia by Zeus. The Glass Manufactory at R6galon. - In R. A rch. VI, 1905, pp. 246- 256, Cii. COTTE and M. GAVARD describe the remains of a glass factory in the valley of Rdgalon. The glass was melted in a mere trench, not an oven or furniace. A chemical analysis of the fragments of glass is given. A "very early " date is suggested. Gallo-Roman Notes. - In R. -9t. Anc.

IIe decides that the camp of the Gauls was on the heights of St. Cloud, and that of the Romans nearly opposite. AFRICA The Painted Sarcophagi from Carthage. - In Mllon. Mle'm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 79-111 (pl.; 8 figs.) A. lH nRON DE VILLEFOSSE describes the twelve painted sarcophagi found by Father Delattre at Carthage since 1898. Eight of these have the form of a temple; four are anthropoidal. One of these, on which is carved in high relief the figure of a priestess (C. R. A cad. isc. 1903, pp. 23-33), is published in colors. These sarcophagi show the thoroughly Hellenic art of the fourth century iB.c. at Carthage and complete our knowledge of the history of the Greek anthro- poidal sarcophagus. An Illustrated Catalogue of Ancient Ships. -In Mon. Mfe'm. A cadl. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 113-154 (pl. ix-x; 29 figs.), P. GAUCKLrEnR publishes and discusses a floor mosaic in a private bath belonging to an ancient house at Althiburus (Henchir-Medeina), partially excavated in 1895 and 1896. (C. R. Acad. Inse. 1898, p. 642; Am. J. Arch. 1899, p. 272.) In the house itself is a mosaic representing marine scenes, Oceanus, Venus Anadyomene, etc., and a ship. This mosaic is in bad condition. Much better preserved and more interesting is the mosaic in the bath. Here the sea, with fishes, a figure of a river god, and a mask of Oceanus. On the sea are twenty-five (originally about thirty) ships of various kinds, but including no ships of war, biremes or triremes, each designated by its Latin (and, in many cases, its Greek) name, and often characterized by a quota- tion from an early Latin poet. Twenty-three different types are repre- sented. The subject-matter is derived from a literary source, probably a work of Varro or a contemporary of Varro, perhaps Verrius Flaccus. The representations themselves are probably derived from illustrations in a copy of the literary source. The buildings and the mosaics belong apparently to the latter part of the second century after Christ. EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, AND MEDIAEVAL ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Thousand and One Churches in Lycaonia. - In Athen. December 16, 1905, W. M. RAMSAY discusses the dates of the churches at Bin-Bir- Kilisse and the neighboring Daould. Bin-Bir-Kilisse is an old site, but most of the existing remains date from the time after the Saracen invasions had ceased to be a constant danger, i.e., after 900 A.D. or thereabouts. The churches at Daould are ascribed chiefly to the period 650-900 A.D. The evidence is chiefly epigraphical. The churches of Bin-Bir-Kilisse represent the building methods of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, not, as heretofore supposed, of early Byzantine times.</page><page sequence="29">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 205 Persian Art. --Persian art, as represented by the miniatures from the fourteenth century on, shows little or no Byzantine influence. On the other hand, a Chinese or Japanese origin is indicated by the types of the faces in the miniatures, while the accessories are strictly in the Chinese manner. This influence came to the Persians through Turkestan, which furnished the Sassanid kings with artists and continued to inspire the art of Persia under the Caliphs, the empire of Tamerlane, and the Turks. The antiquity of this influence is attested by the persistent tradition that Mani, the supposed founder of Manicheism (ca. 240 A.D.), who illustrated with miniatures the book containing his dogmas, learned the art of painting in Turkestan (E. BLOCHET, Gaz. B.-A. XXXIV, 1905, pp. 115-130). The same author describes the peculiarities of painting in Persia, from the Mongol art of the thirteenth century to the art of the present time, in R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 121-148 (6 figs.). Inscriptions on Vessels of the Egyptian Mameluke Dynasty. - In Z. D. Pal. V. XXVIII, 1905, pp. 176-205 (4 pls.), M. SOBERNHEIM de- scribes eight inscribed vessels that have lately been shown at the exhibition of Mohammedan art in Paris. The inscriptions on these vessels date from the time of the second Egyptian Mameluke Dynasty and contain the names of officials, sultans, a sultana, and a caliph. They are of considerable historical and philological interest. Byzantine Leaden Medals. -In J. Int. Arch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 53- 102 (cf. ibid. VIII, pp. 255 ff.), K. M. KONSTANTINOPOULOS continues his catalogue of Byzantine leaden medals in the Numismatic Museum at Athens, describing Nos. 775-1057, and reproducing 126 monograms. The Leaden Medal attributed to David, Emperor of Trebizond.-- In J. Int. A rch. Num. VIII, 1905, pp. 121-130 (fig.), K. M. KONSTANTINO- POULos discusses a leaden medal attributed to David Comnenus, last em- peror of Trebizond (1458-1462), and ascribes it to David Comnenus, brother of Alexius, first emperor of Trebizond (1204-1222). Dragons and Monsters beneath Baptismal Fonts. - In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 189-195 (7 figs.), J. TAVENOR-PERRY calls attention to dragons and other monsters beneath baptismal fonts in northern Europe. Some- times these creatures may be connected with the story of Jonah, sometimes they are purely grotesque. The Hauberk of Chain Mail. --In Archaeologia, LIX, i, 1905, pp. 57- 74 (6 figs.), J. G. WALLER discusses the different forms of chain mail and, their conventional representations in art. The Treasure of the Sacristy of the Patriarchs at Moscow. --In Mon. Meim. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 207-210 (pl.; 2 figs.), F. DE INELY publishes seven objects in the treasury of the Sacristy of the Patriarchs at Moscow. Four of these are "panagias," pendants in which are Byzantine engraved stones. The most remarkable is a cameo represent- ing the Virgin standing with raised hands. In a medallion on her breast is a bust of Jesus. Byzantine cameos are almost unknown. Second only to this is a representation of St. John. A copper decanter covered with mother of pearl is not Byzantine work, though it probably came to Moscow from Constantinople. A fine chalice of onyx, of unknown origin, is called the "cup of Anthony the Roman." It is to be compared with the chalices of the treasure of St. Mark's, in Venice. A shallow, covered goblet of</page><page sequence="30">206 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 green jasper, with enamel decorations in the Florentine style of the six- teenth century, is said to have been brought from Italy in the times of Ivan the Terrible. ITALY The Confirmation in Early Christian Monuments. - This is the sub- ject of a study by F. J. DOLGER in the Rirmn. Quart. 1905, pp. 1-41. He takes up first the inscriptions, then the representations on monuments, and lastly the ancient confirmation chapels or consignatoria. In the inscriptions the expressions vcw(vroT = renatus, avaKa'vtLLoUVL = renocatus, vco/0o~7LToTo, fidelis, fidelis factus, 7r(rroT may all mean "baptized and confirmed " or merely "baptized." (Gratiam) percepit consecutus est is equivalent to "re- ceived into the Christian body." Marini's theory that oL = " confirmed" as e7r-T = "baptized " is pure conjecture. The technical term for confirm- ation was signaculurn, signaculum dominicum, signaculum? chrismatis. Crucem accipere and such expressions may refer to entry into the catechumenate as well as to the sign of the cross used in confirming. The enigmatical lines in the "Mareas" inscription (published by De Rossi in B. Arch. Crist. 1869) reading as follows: tuque sacerdotes docuisti; chrismate sancto tangere bis nullum iudice posse deo, are explained by D1lger as referring to the rule prohibiting priests from ad- ministering the second or confirmatory anointing, this being the prerogative of the bishop. No definite conclusions are drawn regarding the four doubt- ful representations of the confirmation on the monuments. Examples of consignatoria are found at Salona in Dalmatia and at Morsott, Tipasa, and Tigzirt in Africa. The Lateran at Rome had a confirmation-chapel, called the Chrismarium, and Symmachus seems to have meant one of the three oratories which he added to St. Peter's for a consignatoriumn. D)lger does not agree with Marucchi in assigning the metrical inscription from the Verdun Sylloge, which refers to the confirmation, to the subterranean bap- tistery in the catacomb of Priscilla, which Marucchi thinks was used -as a consignatorium at the time when the inscription was composed. The Origin of the Quadrate Nimbus.--In Byz. Z. 1905, pp. 578-583, appears the first instalment of 1"Notes on the Paintings in Sta. Maria Antiqua " by WILPERT. Among other corrections of previous descriptions, the statement that the features of Theodotus, procurator of the church, who is represented in the fresco adorning the end wail of the chapel of Sts. Quiricus and Julitta as presenting the chapel to his holy patrons, have faded out of the picture, is refuted. Wilpert shows that the artist followed a method indicated in other places of painting the portrait of a living person on canvas, to be applied afterward in its proper place in the fresco, and that it is this canvas which has disappeared. He offers a theory of the origin of the quadrate nimbus, the curious signun viventis used so much in Byzan- tine art. The square canvas' portrait called for a surrounding border which was painted in around it, and the usage became so constant as to be ex- tended to portraits of living persons in fresco. Another interesting dis- covery is that of apocryphal scenes from the infancy of the Virgin, painted on the wall of the right nave of the "quadriporticus." Wilpert's correc-</page><page sequence="31">MEDIAEVAL ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 207 tions are chiefly directed against Rushforth's "The Church of S. Maria Antiqua " in the Papers of the British School at Rome, vol. I. The Sacred Image of Christ in the Sancta Sanctorum at the Lateran.- F. DE MAliLY in B. M. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1902, pp. 113-144, discusses the origin of the image of Christ, which, according to tradition, was con- fided to the sea by a priest named Germanos, in the eighth century, and after a miraculous voyage over the waves arrived at Rome. After giving an account of similar traditions current in the Middle Ages regarding relics, and showing that this is really the relic mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis under the reign of Stephen II (752-757), de Mely concludes, chiefly on the evidence afforded by George Hamartolos (842) in his Chronicon, that the ikon is the one which that author mentions as having been cast down by the Iconoclast Leo the Isaurian. The Germanos of the legend was the contemporary patriarch of Constantinople, who must have sent the image by sea to Gregory II. On this basis the legend arose, appearing first in the chronicon of George Hamartolos. Arnolfo di Cambio. --A. VENTURI in L'Arte, 1905, pp. 254-265, recon- structs the life of Arnolfo di Cambio, adding materially to the list of his works. First correcting three dates of importance, that of the tomb of Cardinal de Braye at Orvieto (1282), of the ciborium in Sta. Cecilia in Trastevere (1293, as shown by the inscription unearthed by the recent ex- cavations), and that of the altar of St. Boniface and the tomb of Boniface VIII in St. Peter's (1300), Venturi notes the existence of several hitherto unidentified fragments of the last-mentioned monument in the Grotte Vaticane, and ascribes to Arnolfo a totally new work, the tomb of Hadrian V at Viterbo. Arnolfo was in Perugia in 1277, but what he did there was unknown until the writer discovered in the Museo Archeologico at Perugia three figures designed for the basin of a fountain, which may have been the fountain in the Piazza, the execution of which was in charge of Nicola Pisano, or another which Adamo Rossi believed to have been made by Arnolfo for the lower part of the Piazza. Returning to Rome from Perugia, the sculptor made the statue of Charles I of Anjou, now in the Conservatori, and the bronze St. Peter in the Vatican basilica, and probably the head which was put on an antique philosopher's shoulders to form the marble statue of St. Peter, now in the Grotte. Paying a brief visit to Perugia in 1281, he returned to work on the ciborium in St. Paul's, the de Braye monument at Orvieto, the Oratorium Praesepis in Sta. Maria Maggiore, the tomb of Honorius III, and other works for the Savelli family. He seems to have directed several works at S. Giovanni Laterano before he built the Sta. Cecilia ciborium. After that he left Rome for Florence, only returning in 1300 to execute the altar of St. Boniface and the tomb of Boniface VIII, and died on the 8th of March, 1302. Pisan Art in the Fourteenth Century. - The frescoes of the south and east wall of the Campo Santo at Pisa, especially the 'Triumph of Death' on the south wall, show a prevailing type taken from the art of the Romagna, exemplified by the frescoes at Colalto. The strength and vivid- ness of the Pisan compositions remind one of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and the influence of Florence is also felt. Many details, however, the movement of the figures, their physiognomy and grouping, are not Italian and are only to be explained by the supposition that the artist had a knowledge of conterm-</page><page sequence="32">208 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 porary French art. Whoever painted the frescoes on the east wall had doubtless seen and imitated the frescoes in the palace of the popes at Avignon. The painter of the 'Triumph' was largely influenced by French miniatures and seems to have had a collection of sketches after French motives which he used in his work. (GEORG GRAF VITZTHUM, Rep. f. K. 1905, pp. 199-226.) S. Salvatore de Gallia. - In B. Com. Roma, XXXIII, 1905, pp. 62-103, P. Spezio presents the results of his topographical and historical researches on the church of S. Salvatore de Gallia, belonging to S. Lorenzo in Damaso. SPAIN Post-Visigothic Churches in Spain.--In Archaeologia, LIX, i, 1905, pp. 39-56 (pl.; 10 figs.), A. G. IIiLL describes, with some discussion, the churches of Sta. Maria Maranco (848 A.D.), San Miguel di Lino, and Sta. Cristina de Lena (about 870 A.D.), all in the province of Oviedo, of the style called Latino-Byzantine, and the church of Santiago de Pefialva, in the province of Leon, built between 931 and 951 A.D. in the Mudejar style, probably by a Christian Moorish architect. A Byzantine Ivory in Spain.- In the museum of Vich in Catalonia there existed until recently an ivory relief of the kind called 8GnqL, repre- senting Christ in attitude of benediction, flanked by John the Baptist, who is labelled 1W 0 TTPOAPOMOC, and the Madonna, characterized as MP OV. It was stolen in 1903, along with a mosaic published by E. Roulin in Mon. 3Iem. Acad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), 1900, p. 95. The ivory probably dates from the beginning of the twelfth century, and may have been brought from the East by Catalan crusaders. (A. Muvoz in Byz. Z. 1905, pp. 575-577.) FRANCE The So-called Deambulatorium at Morienval. - J. J. BERTHELI ilr R. Art Chret. 1905, pp. 401-404, objects to the common use of the term deambulatori'in to describe the extremely narrow passage in the apse of the well-known church of Morienval. A dea?bulatorium is a semicircular pas- sage running from transept to transept, separating the choir and sanctuary from the apsidal chapels, and affording access to the latter without the necessity of traversing the former. At Morienval, where the four recesses in the apse can hardly be called apsidal chapels, the passage is not large enough for such a purpose and does not issue on the transept, being cut off from the latter by tw6 eleventh century towers, to the presence of which we may attribute the resulting peculiar plan of the church. Worshippers, therefore, reached the " apsidal chapels " through the sanctuary. A Peculiar Annunciation at Donzy. - The tympanum of the door of the Cluniac church of Ste.-Marie du Pre at Donzy in the diocese of Auxerre is adorned with a sculptured group representing, in the centre, the Virgin seated beneath an arch, holding the Child, figured in a peculiarly stiff and hieratic manner, not upon her knee, but upright against her bosom. To the left an archangel, swinging a censer, makes obeisance to her, and to the right is a prophet bearing in his left hand a staff covered with leaves and in his right a phylactery. The scene is evidently an annunciation, the</page><page sequence="33">MEDIAEVAL ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 209 archangel representing Gabriel, the prophet Isaiah, the staff recalling the prophecy Egredietur virga de radice Jesse. The peculiar treatment of the Child is intended to represent Him as still sub arca ventris clausus, as in the language of the hymns. The date of the tympanum is about 1150. (P. MAYEUR in R. Art Chret. 1905, pp. 261-264.) The Portal of the Northern Transept of Rouen Cathedral. - In R. ,Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 71-96 (4 pls.), LOUISE PILLION discusses the reliefs on the jambs (soubassemnents) of the portal of the northern transept (portail des libraires) of Rouen cathedral. The portal was built soon after 1280, and, like that of the southern transept, is derived from the portals of the transepts of Notre Dame at Paris. The fantastic creatures in the reliefs are derived in great measure from miniatures, but are not illustrations of any work of literature. The iconography of the reliefs is discussed in detail. The Abbey-church of St. Robert at Chaise-Dieu. - MAURICE FAU- coN is the author of a monograph relating to the construction of this church, based on documents preserved in the Vatican. He finds that the architect was a Frenchman, Hugues Morel, who was assisted in his work by Pierre Falciat and Pierre de Cebazat. The church was finished about 1350. Matteo di Giovannetto of Viterbo, the favorite painter of Clement VI, who built the church, painted eight pictures for it, and designed the twenty- eight "histories" which were to ornament the reliquary of St. Robert. The tomb of Clement VI, which stands in the choir, was made by three French sculptors, - Pierre Roye and his two assistants, Jean de Sanholis and Jean David. The so-called tomb of the abbot Renaud de Montclar (t1346) more probably contains the bones of some relative of Clement VI, perhaps one of the Beauforts. The monograph contains interesting details relative to the nature and origin of the materials employed in the construc- tion of the church, their means of transport, and the salaries of the artists. (Notice sur la construction de l'E~glise de la Chaise-Dieu (Haute-Loire), Paris, 1904, Picard.) Sculptures of the Cathedral at Auxerre. - LOUISE PILLION, writing to the R. Art Chre't. 1905, pp. 278-280, 't propos of the recent installation in the Musee du Trocaddro of the casts of the sculptures on the substructure of Auxerre cathedral, discusses the date and affinities of these monuments. She places them at the end of the fourteenth or the beginning of the fifteenth century and draws an interesting parallel between Auxerre and Orvieto, which suggests further proof of the reciprocal influence of French and Italian art in these centuries. Milanesi tells us that Ramo di Paga- nello, who worked at Orvieto in 1293, came "de partibus ultramnontanis." Vasari's "alcunii tedeschi," companions of Niccolo Pisano at Orvieto, refer probably to Frenchmen, all " ultramontani " being grouped under the gen- eric term "gothic " or tedeschi in Vasari's writings, and it is certain that "l'atelier d'Orvieto plonge ses racines dans un sol compose, pour partie, d'e1lryments franyais." The Model of the Church of St. Maclou.-In Mon. Me'm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 211-224 (2 pls.; 2 figs.), A. L. FROTHING- HAM, Jr., publishes and discusses the model of the church of St. Maclou, at Rouen (Am. J. Arch. 1905, p. 383). He shows, by the differences between it and the church, that it is an architect's model, not a copy. The</page><page sequence="34">210 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 model may have been made by Salvart, in 1414, whereas the church was begun in 1432. At any rate, the mere existence of the model gives important information concerning the methods of Gothic architects, and accurate study of it will greatly increase our knowledge. Signatures of French Sculptors in the Middle Ages.-- M. DE AIMELY in C. R. A cad. Insc. 1905, pp. 341-342, communicates some of the results of his investigations of the signatures on French mediaeval sculp- ture. He has collected 170 signatures. Among them are the names signed on the doors of St. Gilles at Arles (1116) and the sculptures of the royal doorway at Chartres (ca. 1140). The first reads Brunus me fecit, the second Rogeru.s, revealing to us two admirable French sculptors who antedate by some time Antelami of Parma (1198) and Nicola Pisano of the thirteenth century, hitherto regarded as the precursors of the Renaissance. Predecessors of Claus Sluter. - A. KLEINCLAUSZ in Gaz. B.-A. XXXIV, 1905, pp. 26-38, publishes a tomb from the abbey of Fontenay near Montbard in Burgundy. It represents the reclining figures of a lord of the Mello family, seigneurs d'Epoisses, and of his wife, and dates from the middle of the fourteenth century. A similar monument was that of Guillaume de Vienne, abbd of St. Sienne, which formerly existed in the Burgundian abbey of that name, and is known to us by the reproduction in Domn Plancher's Histoire ge'nerale de Bourgogne, II, p. 384. Both monu- ments are the products of ateliers of Flemish artists established in Bur- gundy before the advent of Claus Sluter. This Flemish immigration dates from as far back as the time of Count Otho of Burgundy, whose tomb was fashioned by the Flemish Pepin de Huy. A Statue of the School of Champagne.- In AMon. Mm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Pliot), XII, pp. 225-230 (2 pls.; 4 figs.), A. MICHEL publishes a statue of the Virgin and Child, of painted stone, acquired by the Louvre from MIr. Wildenstein in 1905. Comparison with other works shows that it is a work of the school of Troyes and Champagne, of the early part of the sixteenth century, the brief period between the somewhat arbitrary formalism of the fifteenth century and the mannerism of the Renaissance. This work shows the grace and delicacy of the works of this school and period. Limoges Enamels. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 15-30 (3 pls.), J. J. AIARQUET DE VASSELOT discusses Limoges enamels with a background of waving lines (.fond vermicul4). They belong chiefly to the latter part of the twelfth century, but are of different dates. The technique is derived from the East, and is influenced by illuminations in manuscripts. Four classes, or schools, are distinguished by their borders and styles. Ibid. pp. 231-245 (3 pls.) the treatment of the class with border of flowers (encadre- ment de .fleurettes) is finished and the classes with borders of enamelled semicircles and quatrefoils are described. A Lock with Two Gates in the Fifteenth Century.-T n R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 272-285 (fig.), E. CLOUZOT publishes some documents of the sixteenth century and other evidence of the existence of a lock with two gates (ecluse ia sas) at La Roussille, on the Sevre of Niort. Vestments of St. Hugues at Valsainte. - The vestments of St. Hugues, bishop of Grenoble in the twelfth century, are still preserved at Valsainte. They consist of an amict, aube, maniple, and stole. The amict</page><page sequence="35">MEDIAEVAL ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 211 is plain, with no cross. The aube does not differ in general in form from others of the twelfth century. Together with other decoration, it bore along the front border of the caputium or head-opening an inscription em- broidered in silk, of which only the words I(n) OR(ati)O(n)E are left. Whether these were independent of the rest of the inscription, which has disappeared, cannot be said. If they were, they may be compared with In nomine Domini ora pro me on the so-called stole of St. Martin at Aschaffen- burg. The maniple and stole are tipped with trimmings of red silk shot with gold and of microscopical fineness. (L. M. DE MASSIAC in R. Art Chre't. 1905, pp. 406-410.) GERMANY Byzantine Miniatures in Berlin. - In R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 55-70 (5 figs.), J. EBERSOLT discusses the illuminations in the Hamilton Greek Ms. No. 246 in the royal library at Berlin. It is an Evangelistarium et Menolo- gium, and dates (save four leaves of the tenth century) from the thirteenth century. The style of the miniatures is derived from the East, especially from Syria. This and many other Mss., whether Byzantine or Carolingian, show remarkable uniformity in what concerns the illustration of the canons of Eusebius. Inscription on a Byzantine Reliquary. - In Mon. M1e'm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 201-205 (pl.), G. SCHLUMBERGER republishes the reliquary in the form of a domed church in the treasury of the cathe- dral at Aix-la-Chapelle. The Greek inscription on the apse, Lord, protect Ihy servant Eustathios patrician and strategos of Antioch and of Lykandos, fixes the date of the reliquary; for the theme of Lykandos was not con- stituted until about 915 A.D., Antioch was not recaptured from the Sara- cens until 969, and was finally lost in 1085. Probably Lykandos was lost somewhat earlier; the reliquary is therefore dated between 969 and about 1080 A.D. The Eustathios mentioned is not yet identified. The other inscriptions are quotations from the Psalms (132, 8; 132, 13; 86, 3), which contain references to Jerusalem or Zion. The reliquary resembles the famous mosque of Omar. Perhaps, then, it was made at Jerusalem. ENGLAND The Sculptures of Wells Cathedral.- In Archaeologia, LIX, i, 1905, pp. 143-206 (53 pls.; fig.), W. H. ST. JOHN HOPE publishes the elabo- rate imagery and sculptures of the western front of Wells cathedral, and W. R. R. LETHABY adds suggestions as to the identification of some of the images. The sculptures and images are contemporary with the build- ing, ca. 1225-1240. Scenes from the Old and New Testaments, the Corona- tion of the Virgin, the Resurrection of the dead, angels, kings, queens, ladies, bishops, etc., are represented. A general and detailed description is given. The Painted Chamber of the Palace of Westminster. -The royal bed chamber of the Palace of Westminster, called from its decorations the Painted Chamber, was destroyed after the fire of 1834. An addition to the existing reproductions of the paintings in the Chamber has been found in the University Galleries at Oxford, consisting of several drawings by Ed- ward Crocker, who directed the alterations of the palace in 1819. Some of these drawings, notably the Coronation of Edward the Confessor, are repro-</page><page sequence="36">212 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. X, 1906 duced in an article by W. R. LETHIABY in Burl. Mag. 1905, pp. 257-269. lie dates the paintings between 1262 and 1277, and thinks that they were ordered by Henry III and designed by " Master William," painter to that king. Walter of Durham, painter to Edward I, was also engaged on them. The decoration consisted of horizontal rows of the Old Testament " his- tories," excepting the coronation scene, with figures of Virtues on the win- dow-jambs. The dado beneath was painted like a green curtain, and each picture had a French motto in black letter. Eaton Bray Church. - In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 269-274 (7 figs.), J. ROMILLY ALLEN describes the church at Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire. It con- tains much fine Early English architectural sculpture and ironwork. Norman Pont at Thorpe-Salvin. - In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 265-269 (2 figs.), G. LE BLANC SMITH discusses a Norman font at Thorpe-Salvin, Yorkshire. Five representations, which are visible in arched recesses, are explained as the Rite of Baptism and the Four Seasons. St. Mary's Church at Horton Kirby. - In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 162- 175 (11 figs.), J. RUSSELL LARKBY, describes St. Mary's church, at Horton Kirby, Kent, and gives its architectural history since its erection, in tran- sitional style, not far from 1200 A.D. Leathley Church. - Leathley church, Yorkshire, an early Norman church, built, perhaps, on a Saxon foundation, is described by W. CUD- WORTN in Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 204-208 (4 figs.). An Old Manor House at Northborough. -In Reliq. XT, 1905, pp. 184-188 (5 figs.), CHARLOTTE MASON describes the Manor house at North- borough, near Peterborough, said to have been built in 1340. The archi- tecture, of the Decorated period, is fine in its details. Cromwell's widow and daughter once lived here. Manors of High Wycombe. - In Reliq. XT, 1905, pp. 176-183 (2 figs.), T. HUGH BRYANT gives descriptive and historical notes on manors, etc., at High Wycombe. Some Roman remains have also been found here. Tomb of Sir Roger de Kerdestone.--In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 200-203 (3 figs.), E. M. BELOE, JR., describes the tomb of Sir Roger de Kerdestone, at Reepham, Norfolk. It is a fine work of the fourteenth century. The knight rests, under a Gothic canopy, upon a bed of stones. Below are eight figures in relief. The Crystal of Lothair. -In Archaeologia, LIX, i, 1905, pp. 27-38 (pl.), 0. M. DALTON publishes the crystal of Lothair in the British Museum, a fine intaglio with representations of eight scenes from the story of Susanna, Frankish work of the ninth century, and gives its history. RENAISSANCE ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Renaissance Medals with the Head of Christ.- In Reliq. XI, 1905, pp. 237-248 (10 figs.), G. F. HILLr concludes his treatment of Medallic Por- traits of Christ with a discussion of several medals, paintings, engravings, etc., related more or less closely to the types previously discussed. Mantegna as a Mystic.-- The common impression which Mantegna leaves as the most humanistic of painters has blinded critics to his mystic</page><page sequence="37">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 213 quality. This is certainly present in some of his Madonnas, with their almond-shaped, inscrutable eyes and enigmatical smile, and in many cases can be seen in the treatment of the Child. In one picture, the 'Holy Family' owned by Dr. Ludwig Mond, Mantegua has resorted to evident symbolism. Here the Virgin's bust, placed low in the picture and rising from a well-head, can only be meant to symbolize the Immaculate Concep- tion, the Fons Signatus of Solomon's Song. In the ' Adoration of the Magi' in the Johnson collection in Philadelphia, the strange gaze of the Magi, convergent on the Child's face, and the aloofness of the Virgin's expression, are most effective in producing a sense of mystery. The minimum of light and shade in Mantegna's technique, his economy of line and suppressed modelling, gave him the power to express such spiritualized notions. What gave him the impulse in this direction is uncertain, although it is sure that he drew from Hubert Van Eyck, and a drawing of his shows that Donatello's strange Madonna had impressed him. (ROGER E. FRY in Burl. Mlag. VIII, 1905, pp. 87-98.) Two Attributions of Paintings.- On internal evidence BERNHARD BERENSON in Rass. d'Arte, 1905, pp. 177-179, ascribes to the little-known Cosimo Rosselli a portrait of a Florentine gentleman in the Spiridon col- lection at Paris. The attribution rests on the resemblance of the ear in the portrait to Cosimo's characteristic ear, especially as seen in the head of one of the spectators in the ' Sermon on the Mount' in the Sistine Chapel, and the similar treatment of the head in general. To Francesco Botticini, Be- renson ascribes a tondo portrait of a youth in the Royal Palace at Stockholm, chiefly from the " parallel " locks of hair occurring in this picture and others of Botticini. Unknown Works of Bernardo Daddi.- OSWALD SIRnN in L'Arte, 1905, pp. 280-281, publishes (with two reproductions) two hitherto unknown works of Bernardo Daddi. The first is a small triptych in the ducal castle at Meiningeun; in the centre, a Madonna with two saints, on the right wing a crucifixion, on the left Sts. Peter and Paul. Another very similar triptych by Daddi belongs to the Louvre. In the Magazzino of the Uffizi is a triptych of large dimensions with the Coronation of the Virgin in the central panel, the wings being occupied by a throng of adoring saints, forty-two in all. Comparison with Sir Hubert Parry's triptych at Highnam Court and the similar work in the Cook collection at Richmond, serves to establish the picture in the Uffizi as a late work by Daddi. The Author of the " Diirer " Medals. - A number of medals (chiefly copies) and a relief in Kehbheim stone, the latter belonging to Mr. Pierpont Morgan, are discussed by S. MONTAGU PEARTREE in Burl. Mag. 1905, pp. 445-467. All but one have the Diirer monogram and are dated from 1509 to 1514. Those reproduced in this article are a three-quarters woman's head, a so-called portrait of the " Elder Diirer," a medallion-portrait of a woman in the British Museum (lacking the monogram but classed with the Diirers on grounds of style and technique by Peartree), and the Morgan relief, a full-length nude figure of a woman seen from behind. The close relation existing between these and certain sculptures by Hans Daucher in St. Ulrich's at Augsburg leads Peartree to the conclusion that the Diirer medals are his work, done after sketches by Diirer, which explains the pres- ence of the monogram.</page><page sequence="38">214 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1900 The Jordaens Exposition at Antwerp.- The Gaz. B.-A. XXXIV, 1905, pp. 247-255, contains an appreciation of Jordaens by H. HYMANS, based on the master's works assembled in the Jordaens exposition opened last year at Antwerp. Hyinans believes that the exposition will heighten the artist's fame, hitherto somewhat obscured by that of Rubens. ITALY A Lost Work of Donatello.- The tabernacles for the Host existing in Sta. Francesca Romana, in the cloister of Sant' Agostino in Rome, and in the old cathedral at Capranica, are remarkably similar, but nevertheless not copied one from the other. So many characteristic Donatellian details are found in all three when compared with a work of that artist like the niche for Verrocchio's St. Thomas in Or San Michele in Florence, that we must suppose that they were copied from some lost work of Donatello's, executed at or about the time of his sojourn at Rome. (LISETTA CIACCIO, L'A rte, 1905, pp. 375-381.) Two Lombard Sculptors of the Renaissance. - FRANCESCO MALA- GUZZI VYALERI, in Rass. d' Arte, 1905, pp. 169-173, discusses the work of Andrea Fusina and Caradosso. To the former he attributes the ' Madonna and Child blessing Francis I' in the Borromeo collection at Milan, and, somewhat reservedly, however, the two Madonnas in relief against a back- ground adorned with putti and a profile of Francis I, all three in the Museo Archeologico of the same city. The author believes that one of the sup- posed works of Caradosso - the frieze of putti and busts in medallion in the Sacristy of S. Satiro in Milan --cannot be by him, inasmuch as the records relating to the decoration of the church contain no mention of him, and he was absent from Milan at the time of its construction. The " Depo- sition" in terra-cotta in the same church, ascribed to Caradosso, shows little or no relation to the products of the goldsmith's and bronze-worker's art by which we know him. Attributions in the Uffizi and Pitti Galleries.- In an open letter addressed to Corrado Ricci (Rcass. d' Arte, 1905, pp. 84-87) G. FRIZZONI slg- gests some new attributions for paintings in the two large galleries at Flor- ence. A 'Madonna' in the Uffizi, hitherto given to Polidoro Veneziano, is ascribed by Frizzoni to Bernardino Sicinio. The' Sacrifice of Iphigenia' in the Uffizi, which has been ascribed to Tiepolo and Sebastiano Ricci, is assigned to Bernardino Galliari, an eighteenth century imitator of these masters. The portrait of Eleanora de' Medici in the Pitti is taken from Scipione Pulzone da Gaeta and given to Frans Pourbus the younger. An ' Adoring Virgin,' a tondo in the Uffizi, labelled "Scuola fiorentina," is claimed for Botticini and the monogram H P painted in the left lower corner of the Uffizi picture commonly called the ' Miser' is shown by Frizzoni to refer not to Hoiratius Paulyn, but to Hendrick Pot. Several other attributions of less important pictures are also questioned. Documents relative to S. Satiro in Milan. - F. MALAGUZZI VALERI, in Arch. Stor. Lomb. 1905, pp. 140-151, publishes documents illustrative of the history of the church of S. Satiro. They are: an inventory of the objects in the church in 1476; documents relative to the chapel of Sta. Bar- bara ; documents showing the existence of a ducal chapel; and notes on</page><page sequence="39">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 215 the works of art in the church, viz. Boltraffilo's ' Sta. Barbara,' the altar of the Pietil, the smaller doors of the church, the chapel of St. Catherine, the work of the sculptor Cristoforo da Birago, a model of the facade, and some figures from the tiburium, besides a list of payments to Ambrogio da Fossano, painter. Michelino da Besozzo and Giovannino de' Grassi. - PIETRO TOESCA, in L'Arte, 1905, pp. 321-338, devotes an article to these two Milanese artists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Giovannino, the sculptor of the lavabo in the Sacristy of Milan Cathedral, is shown to be the author of the drawings of animals, preserved in a codex of the Biblioteca Civica at Ber- gamo. He may be called the precursor of Michlelino da Besozzo, himself celebrated for his animal sketches. Both artists were cognate with, not dependent on, the school of Verona. German influence, to be noticed in Giovannino, becomes marked in Michelino, who shows a close connection with Wilhelm of Cologne in a picture of the Virgin and Child with Sts. John the Baptist, Anthony, and Catherine, in the Pinacoteca at Siena. This painting is for the first time assigned to Michelino in this article by Toesca, on the basis of the signature Michelinus fecit and internal evidence. A reconstruction of Michelino's life and a list of his few known works are included in the article. Italian Art and Milanese Collections.- An anonymous article in the New York Sun of January 1, 1905, is reprinted with some changes, in R. Arch. VI, 1905, pp. 214-326. The museums (especially the Poldo-Pezzoli museum) and private collections of Milan are highly praised, while the management of other Italian museums and the attitude of the Italians toward foreign students of Italian art is sharply criticised. The Painted Fagade of the Palazzo Milesi in Rome. - GOFFREDO GRILLI writes in Rass. d' Arte, 1905, pp. 97-102, of the houses in Rome, faCades of which were decorated with frescoes, and particularly of the com- positions by Polidoro and Maturino which adorned the Palazzo Milesi in Via della Maschera d' Oro, now the property of Prince Lancelloti. This palace still preserves some traces of its decorations, which consisted of a frieze descriptive of the history of Niobe, running beneath the windows of the second story, and episodes of historical and mythological content be- neath and between the windows of the third story. Designs for this fagade may be recognized among Polidoro's drawings in the Uffizi, but of most importance is the series of designs for the Niobe frieze preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan. A document published by Bertolotti shows that these drawings described as a frieze by Polidoro da Caravaggio for the painting " sopra il palazzo del Sig. Martio Milesi figurante 1' His- toria di Niobe saettata " was stolen from a Roman antiquary named Pietro Stefanone in 1611. Nothing further is known of its history until its appear- ance in the Ambrosiana. The Dialogues of Francisco de Hollanda and Donato Giannotti.- These works of the sixteenth century, both purporting to be conversations in which Michelangelo took part, have been used to some extent in recon- structing the biography and particularly the personality of the artist and in tracing his relations with Vittoria Colonna who appears in Hollanda's dia- logue. They are however, purely fictitious discussions composed to serve the literary purpose of their respective authors. Hollanda's acquaintance with</page><page sequence="40">216 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 Michelangelo was slight. Giannotti, on the other hand, was a good friend of the artist, and the indirect light he throws on Michelangelo's personality is of some real value. (H. TIETZE, Rep. f K. 1905, pp. 295-320.) The Medallion of Cardinal Bembo. - The medallion representing Bembo in cardinal's dress with the inscription Petri Bembi car., and a Pegasus on the reverse, has been by many identified with the medallion mentioned in Benvenuto Cellini's autobiography as made by him during a visit to Bembo at Padua. This, however, was done in wax or plaster, and we have no record of its having been finished in more durable material. Moreover, at the time of Cellini's visit, Bembo was not yet cardinal, and the medallion in other ways does not correspond to the sculptor's description. L. RIzzoLI in L'Arte, 1905, pp. 276-280, inclines to attribute the work to Danese Cattaneo (1513-1573), who was the author of the bust of the cardinal in the church of S. Antonio at Padua. FRANCE Two Works of the Italian Renaissance.- In Mon. Me'dm. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Plot), XII, pp. 231-236 (pl.; fig.), G. MIGEON publishes a bronze statuette of a youth in a short kilt, and an engraved silver plaque represent- ing Christ healing a sick man in the presence of the twelve disciples and a woman. The first is an Italian work, of the time between 1520 and 1540, cast by the cire perdue process. It resembles ancient figures of camilli or lares, especially one in the Naples museum. The background of the silver plaque (a bronze replica of which in the collection of Mr. G. Dreyfus has been published by E. Miintz, Gaz. B.-A. 1883, May and June, and E. Moli- nier, Les Plaquettes, Vol. I, p. 67) shows St. Peter's without its dome. It is attributed to Pietro da Milano. A Bronze Relief in the Louvre. - In Mon. Me'm. A cad. Insc. (Fonda- tion Piot), XII, pp. 159-176 (5 figs.), E. MICHON discusses a bronze relief, now set in above a door of the " Salle des Caryatides" in the Louvre. It is apparently by the same artist as the relief in the Wallace collection (CLAUDE PHILLIPS, Burl. Mag. 1904, pp. 111-124), which is a copy of the marble relief in the Louvre, called the " Danseuse Borghese." The relief under discussion represents in the foreground three maidens decking a candelabrum with garlands and flowers, and in the background at the left a temple. This is a copy of another marble relief in the Louvre (Catal. som- maire, 1641), which came from the Borghese palace. Comparison of the two bronzes with the originals and with the bronze relief by Lorenzetto in the Chigi chapel of Sta. Maria del Popolo, in Rome, two figures of which are copied from the " Danseuse Borghese," leads to the conclusion that the two bronzes are works of the seventeenth century. The history of the marble originals and of the bronzes confirms this result and indicates that the copies were made in France. The Date of the Rothschild 'Violin Player.'- This picture in the col- lection of the late Baron Alphonse de Rothschild, formerly attributed to Raphael, and now to Sebastiano del Piombo, bears the date MDXVIII. In 1518, however, Sebastiano was completely under the influence of Michelan- gelo and could scarcely have produced a work of a style so Raphaelesque as that of the Rothschild portrait. The date has doubtless been tampered with, as indeed is indicated by the suspicious formation of the first three</page><page sequence="41">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 217 letters. The painting itself points to some year between 1510 and 1515. (GusTAVO FRIZZONI in Chron. d. Arts, 1905, p. 260.) Dosiades and Theocritus offering their Works to Apollo and Pan. - In Mon. Mem. A cad. Insc. (Fondation Piot), XII, pp. 155-158 (2 pls.; fig.), H. OMONT publishes two pages of the Greek Ms. 2832 in the Bibliothbque Nationale. On one Dosiades, standing at the left, offers to Apollo, who stands on a tripod at the right, his poem entitled The Altar (Bo)/dA), which is written on a high altar that occupies the middle of the page. On the other page, Theocritus offers to Pan his poem entitled The Flute (Y'pLvy), which is written on a flute or pipe. This has the shape of a truncated cone, with eight holes in the side and a small mouth-piece at the smaller end. Beside the mouth-piece are, apparently, two strings. A similar flute is represented in the edition of Theocritus published at Venice, in 1516, by Zacharias Callergi. These miniatures, which date from the second half of the four- teenth century, are clearly derived from ancient originals. ENGLAND Two Miniatures by De Limbourg. - ROGER E. FRY, in Burl. Mag. 1905, pp. 435-445, describes two miniatures by Pol de Limbourg or his brothers, the artists of the' Tres Riches Heures' of the Duc de Berry at Chantilly. The first, occurring on p. 109 of Ms. Douce No. 144 in the Bodleian Library, has already been ascribed to the de Limbourgs. The other is from a Book of Hours (No. 62 in James's Catalogue of MSS. in the Fitzwilliamr Museum at Cambridge) which formerly belonged to Isabel Stuart, daughter of James I of Scotland, and first wife of Francis, Duke of Brittany. It represents a Virgin and Child, with scenes from the life of the Virgin, and was identified by comparison with No. 166 Frangais of the Bibliothbque Nationale. Fry regards it as the work of the " second " hand of the ' Tres Riches Heures' identified for convenience with Jean, brother of Pol de Limbourg. An Explanation of the 'Simon Magus' at Buckingham Palace. - This picture has been shown to be part of the predella of an altarpiece painted by Benozzo Gozzoli for the Confraternity of the Purification of the Virgin and of St. Zenobius at Florence, about 1461. The picture represents in the background a figure flying from a kind of platform, and in the fore- ground the same figure lying prostrate. To the left a Roman official is enthroned, surrounded by soldiers; to the right stand Sts. Paul and Peter with their disciples. The presence of St. Paul has cast some doubt on the interpretation of the picture as the Fall of Simon Magus, but H. P. HORNE finds that the version of the story given by Petrus de Natalibus, bishop of Equilio in his Catalogus Sanctorum et gestorum eorum, as well as a Tuscan version in the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence, contemporary with Benozzo, both introduced St. Paul into the story. (Burl. Mag. 1905, pp. 377-383.) A Cup with the Arms of William the Silent. - In A rchaeologia, LIX, i, 1905, pp. 83 ff. (5 pls.), C. H. READ publishes a fine silver-gilt cup, the property of the Earl of Yarborough, on which are the arms of William the Silent, with inscriptions and elaborate reliefs referring to a victory of the Dutch over the Spaniards near Enkhuyzen in 1573. A standing figure on the cover symbolizes Enkhuyzen.</page><page sequence="42">218 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 UNITED STATES The "Maitre de F16malle " and Spain. - The " Master of Flemalle," whose work has assumed new importance since the Exposition des Primitifs, either visited or lived in Salamanca, according to Sir J. C. ROBINSON. His chief evidence for this is the reproduction of the apse of the old cathedral at Salamanca in the 'Virgin' belonging to Mr. Salting. The color-harmony of the master, verging always toward gray, is to be noticed in a ' Mass of St. Gregory' in the parish church of Bonnella della Vierra near Avila, in the vicinity of Salamanca. Robinson does not answer the ques- tion whether this and other similar pictures are later works of the Master of Fldmalle or " school-pictures," but regards them as evidence that the painter worked at one time in Salamanca, and reminds us that his present title rests upon the assurance of an obscure dealer that a picture of his in the Frankfort Museum came from the Flemish abbey of Fldmalle. (Burl. Mag. 1905, pp. 387-393.) The Bulletin of the MIetropolitan Museum of New York, January 1906, announces that the 'Virgin of Salamanca' by the "Maitre de Flem'alle " has recently entered the Museum collections, having been purchased with the income of the Rogers Fund, together with two panels. The latter are by Carlo Crivelli, and represent Sts. George and Dominic. The Portrait of Philip IV in Boston. - The Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin of October, 1905, publishes the opinions of CARL JUSTI, SIR WALTER ARMSTRONG, and R. D. GAULEY, all naming Velasquez as the painter of the recently secured portrait of Philip IV. The item which appeared in Am. J. Arch. 1905, p. 382, entitled " A Velasquez," and announcing the gift to the Prado of a portrait by Velasquez of Philip IV, on the part of the Duchess of Villahermosa, was incorrect. The picture given to the Prado was by Velasquez, but not a portrait of Philip IV. Pictures in the Johnson Collection at Philadelphia. - A description of the Italian paintings in this collection is furnished to the Rass. d'Arte, 1905, pp. 113-121, 129-135, by F. MASON PERKINS. He corrects many of the attributions, notably that of a ' Madonna with Saints' which has been given to Bissolo, but should be assigned to Basaiti. The article gives us a good reproduction of the portrait of Giuliano de' Medici (thus identified by Perkins) already recognized by Rankin as belonging to that series of pictures which Berenson assigns to his ' Amico di Sandro' (see Berenson, Study and Criticism of Italian Art, Vol. I, p. 63, note). The great names given to some of the paintings are contested by Perkins, excepting an ' Interment of the Virgin' ascribed to Fra Angelico's early period, a ' Dead Christ sustained by Weeping Angels' by Carlo Crivelli, a 'Portrait of a Young Man' by Antonello da Messina, a 'Portrait of an Admiral' by Tintoretto, a ' Madonna and Child with Angels ' by Matteo di Siena, and some others. The ' Leda ' in the Johnson collection is regarded by Perkins as a work of one of Leonardo's followers, and probably a copy after a lost original by the great master himself. The Bramantino Portraits. - The series of twenty-five portraits as- cribed to Bramantino, twelve of which were bought at Christie's last April for the Metropolitan Museum in New York, formis the subject of an article in Biurl. Mag.

They origi- nally formed a frieze in a room in the castle of San Martino di Guznago,</page><page sequence="43">AMERICA] ARCtHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1905 219 midway between Brescia and Mantua. This frieze occupied two sides of the room and then ran along the sides of a beam which crosses the centre of the room parallel to the other panels. The signature L B in ligature on the back of certain of the panels has been held to be that of Bernardino Luini. Another divergence from the generally accepted opinion that they are by Bramantino is P. G. KONODY'S suggestion (New York Herald, Paris edition, August 28, 1905) that they are the copies of such a frieze by Bramantino, made just before its destruction for Raphael by one of his pupils. This fact is mentioned in the life of Piero della Francesca by Vasari, who says that Raphael had this done " to the end that he might possess the likeness of the persons represented; for these were all great personages," etc. After Raphael's death, Giulio Romano, his heir, pre- sented them to Paolo Giovio. After this we hear of them no more, but Giovio was for many years the friend of Isabella d' Este, and this might account for their appearance in the Gonzaga castle. The faces seem more like portraits than decorative heads, the monograms upon the panels might be initials, and the absence of any Gonzaga portraits makes for Mr. Konody's suggestion that they were not originally intended for the castle. Moreover, an original would more probably be in fresco than on wood in tempera, as is the case with these panels. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY Haida Texts and Myths - Bulletin 29 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, by JOHN R. SWANTON. This is a collection of texts (partly in the original) and myths relating to the Indians of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. Their interest is mainly that of folklore, eth- nology, and philology, but some archaeological material is included. Relics of the Attiwandarons. - In Rec. Past, IV, 1905, pp. 266-275 (50 figs.), W. J. WINTEMBERG describes numerous relics of the Attiwanda- rons, the earliest historical inhabitants of western Ontario and neighboring regions. The relics consist of flint arrowheads, etc., pipes of clay and stone, sometimes with engraved figures, bone utensils, a few copper awls and shells. Mounds built by the Sioux. - In Am. Ant. XXVII, 1905, pp. 217-223, W. UPHAM describes mounds in Minnesota, near St. Paul, and gives evi- dence showing that they were built by the Sioux, one of them as late as 1834. Aboriginal Pottery from the Wyoming Valley. - In the Proceedings and Collections of the Wyoming Historical and Geological Society, IX, 1905, pp. 137-170 (Wilkesbarre, Pa.), CHRISTOPHER WREN compares the pottery of Pennsylvania with that of New York, and concludes that much of the for- mer was made further north. Most of the pottery is preserved in fragments. The clays of the region are poorly adapted for making fine ware ; the deco- ration was principally confined to the rim and neck of the vases. Pls. 7, 8, and 12 show rim decorations, and pl. 6, vase outlines. Early Smoking Pipes of the North American Aborigines. - In the Proceedings and Collections of the Wyoming Historical and Geological Society (Wilkesbarre, Pa.), IX, 1905, pp. 107-136, A. F. BERLIN quotes references to authorities, notes the scarcity of pipes along the Atlantic coast, and mentions the theory supported by this scarcity that smoking was indulged</page><page sequence="44">220 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. X, 1906 in to a limited extent till the white people, by the cultivation of tobacco, made it popular. The following types of pipes are described: tubular, stemless, double conoidal, " mound," monitor or platform, elephant, bird and animal pipes, earth pipes, and calumets or great pipes. The illustra- tions represent pipes from the Iroquois, the Potomac Valley, from Cali- fornia, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Canada. The Ancient Monuments of Northern Honduras, and the Adjacent Parts of Yucatan and Guatemala; also a Visit to the Rio Grande Ruins.- In the Journ. Anthrop. Inst. of Gt. Br. and Ire. XXXV, 1905, Janu- ary-June, pp. 103-112, T. W. GANN classifies the monuments of northern Honduras and adjacent parts of Yucatan and Guatemala as temples, build- ings within mounds, stelae, stone-faced pyramids, fortifications, and ovoid underground chambers. From burial mounds and mounds for other purposes are obtained weapons and tools of flint, chert, obsidian, jadite, granite, etc. Projectile points, knives, hammer-stones, scrapers, celts, weights, sling- stones, sinkers, etc., make up the list of specimens. Pottery is abundant in the form of both vases and effigies. Burial took various forms; earth, cist, or secondary; traces of cremation are found. Hieroglyphics and picto- graphs are numerous, for which no satisfactory key has as yet been found. Indian Music of South America.--In Harper's Mlagazine, January, 1906, pp. 255-257, CHARLES JOHNSON POST discusses the music and instru- ments of the Indians of Lake Titicaca. The flute, played like a clarinet, the " Pandean" pipes, seven in number, and the drum assist in the produc- tion of motives and simple melodies of which a few examples are given in the text. The importance of these to the archaeologist rests on the author's conclusion that these with others "are the music of the Incas unchanged from the days of Pizarro and the Conquest." A Method of Preserving Shell Specimens. - " A solution of clear gelatin, such as is used for bacteriologic cultures, of about three per cent to four per cent strength, is kept fluid over a sand bath and a Bunsen burner. Into this the specimens are placed, and allowed to remain until about one minute after all bubbles of air have ceased. While in the gela- tin the specimens may be thoroughly cleaned with a camel's-hair brush. They are then removed and placed in a vessel containing ordinary com- mercial formalin solution or formaldehyde, where they are allowed to remain for a few moments or at the convenience of the operator, and are then removed, drained, and allowed to dry slowly." (P. M. JONES, A mer. A nthropol. N.S. VII, 1905, pp. 654 f.)</page></plain_text>
